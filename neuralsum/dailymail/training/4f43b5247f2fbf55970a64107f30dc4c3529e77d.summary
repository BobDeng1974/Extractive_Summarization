by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:28 am on 20th july 2011 marksmen are to be licensed to shoot at least 35,000 badgers every year to halt the spread of @entity5 in cattle			1
environment minister @entity7 yesterday gave the go - ahead for two pilot badger culls on farms in the @entity11 next summer			0
if the trials are successful , a bigger slaughter covering more than 5,000 square miles of @entity15 farmland will get under way			0
wildlife groups warned the ‘ controlled shootings ’ could leave thousands of badgers maimed and injured			1
ahead of the announcement , the @entity21 said it believed that at least 70 per cent of the badger population in large areas of the country would be killed there are approximately 190,000 badgers in @entity28			1
the move was also condemned by @entity30 , with shadow environment secretary @entity31 claiming it was prompted by ' short - term political calculation ' and was not backed by scientific evidence			0
farmers have called for action for years , but mass slaughter of the animals has polarised opinion , with wildlife campaigners bitterly opposed			2
farmers say badgers are one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers and believe that a cull would save them money in the long run			1
environment secretary @entity7 insisted : ' i believe this is the right way forward			0
' @entity51 , director of communications for the @entity52 , said : ' today is a black day for badgers - a day we have been dreading			2
' at a time when the @entity58 government has stepped back from a cull , the government in @entity28 is slowly shredding its own animal welfare credentials			0
' the charity said vaccination of badgers , increased levels of testing , improved biosecurity and stricter controls on the movement of cattle were betters ways of ridding cattle of the disease			2
ahead of the announcement , it said it believed that at least 70 per cent of the badger population in certain areas of the country would be killed , despite it saying scientific studies showing that a cull would be of little help in reducing the disease in the long term , and could actually make things worse in some areas			0
mrs @entity7 said there would be further consultation on the proposed guidance issued to @entity28 , who will issue culling licences , and in the first year there would be two pilot schemes			0
she said : ' i wish there was some other practical way of dealing with this , but we ca n't escape the fact that the evidence supports the case for a controlled reduction of the badger population in the areas worst affected by bovine @entity5			1
' with the problem of @entity5 spreading and no usable vaccine on the horizon , i 'm strongly minded to allow controlled culling , carried out by groups of farmers and landowners as part of a science - led carefully managed policy of badger control			1
' farmers want to see a policy to control badgers to tackle a problem they say is one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers she added : ' initially in the first year , the culling method would be piloted in two areas , to confirm the effectiveness and humaneness of controlled shooting			1
' an independent panel of scientific experts will be asked to evaluate the pilots			0
' she said if culling was ultimately authorised ' we will look to the farmers involved to show that they take their responsibility very seriously and that they are committed to delivering culling effectively and humanely '			2
efforts to control the disease have been hampered by the transmission of @entity5 bacteria between wild badgers and cattle			1
approximately 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in @entity28 that year for @entity5 control the number of new incidents of @entity5 in 2010 increased by 7.5 per cent from 2009 to 3,622 £ 500 million has been spent in the last 10 years combating the disease the disease will cost the economy £ 9 billion over the next 40 years without further action to tackle it there are an estimated 190,000 badgers in @entity28 badgers cause the new infections in cattle herds in around 40 - 50 per cent of cases under the new scheme , an estimated 1,000 - 1,500 badgers will be culled in each 150 kilometre squared cull area ( 60 square miles ) over a period of four years beneficial effects to cattle from culling are seen after three years			1
the first injectable badger vaccine , the @entity164 , was licensed in march 2010 vaccinating badgers costs an average of £ 2,250 per year per km squared			1
trapping and shooting badgers costs £ 2,500 per year per km squared , while shooting free - running badgers costs £ 200 per year per km squared @entity169 , senior scientist for the @entity52 , said : ' the @entity52 is sympathetic to farmers struggling to cope with the effects of this crippling disease and thinks that the problem of bovine @entity5 in cattle needs a sustainable and effective solution			1
' but this is not such a solution			0
we believe that the government have taken the wrong fork in the road with this risky policy			0
' this cull will contribute little or nothing to the long - term goal of eradicating @entity5 nationally			1
instead it will wipe out huge numbers of this much - loved species , including many animals which are healthy			0
last week a key government adviser said a cull would be a mistake			0
@entity193 , who conducted a major review into badgers and bovine tb in the 1990s and recommended a trial cull which took place over the following 10 years , said he did not think it was ' an effective policy '			2
it has appeared likely over recent weeks the @entity201 would allow a cull , after experts including its chief scientist and chief vet concluded that co-ordinated and sustained culling of badgers , which can spread the disease to livestock , was likely to reduce tb rates in cattle			2
a two - page document produced following a meeting in april of the group of experts , set out the latest data from the randomised badger culling trials ( @entity218 ) , showing around a 16 per cent reduction in new infections in herds following a cull			0
but last week @entity193 , one of the scientific experts involved in the meeting , said : ' if you look at the evidence from the @entity218 you will see that if you cull intensively for at least four years , you will have a net benefit of reducing @entity5 in cattle of 12 per cent to 16 per cent			1
' so you leave 85 per cent of the problem still there , having gone to a huge amount of trouble to cull a huge number of badgers			2
' it does n't seem to be an effective way of controlling the disease			0
