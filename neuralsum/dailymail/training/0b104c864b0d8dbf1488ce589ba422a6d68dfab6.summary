by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 21:13 est , 29 january 2013 the @entity2 risks becoming a ‘ political prosecutor ’ rather than an animal welfare organisation , a senior @entity5 warned yesterday			2
sir @entity6 , the former solicitor general , said the costs of a recent case involving @entity10 ’s local hunt were far too high			1
and he called for the charity ’s cases to be taken over by the @entity13			2
mps clashed over the the @entity16 hunt , which prime minister @entity10 has ridden with , after it was the subject of a £ 327,000 private prosecution by the @entity2 the @entity2 prosecuted the @entity16 hunt in @entity19 last year at a cost of £ 327,000 following covert filming			1
the hunt was fined £ 4,000 after admitting four offences			0
although two of its members pleaded guilty and were fined , their supporters claimed the case was politically motivated to target the prime minister			0
‘ if they continue to prosecute at such huge expense in such a disproportionate way , they will be open to public criticism ... by the judge , as they were , or by @entity14 , or by ordinary members of the public , ’ sir @entity6 said			1
speaking at a @entity41 debate , he said the @entity13 would be more dispassionate			0
he added : ‘ this is not to say the @entity2 should not investigate , but it needs to be careful that it does not move away from being an animal welfare organisation and become a political campaigner , using the state prosecuting system as a weapon			2
’ the well - attended debate was triggered by @entity5 mp @entity50 , a former head of the @entity51			1
former solicitor general sir @entity6 warned the @entity2 would face more ' public criticism ' if it pursued cases against hunts he claims that the charity is pursing an ‘ aggressive political agenda ’ against pet owners which is ‘ at odds with animal welfare ’			1
pointedly avoiding the subject of hunting , mr @entity50 called for ‘ absolute clarity and accountability ’ about the charity ’s role as a prosecutor			2
he said it pursued only ‘ tantalising ’ cases and that some defendants pleaded guilty because they feared crippling legal costs			0
but @entity72 , speaking for the government , told @entity14 the charity had the right to bring private prosecutions and that it performed a ‘ valuable role ’ bringing cruelty cases which might otherwise go unprosecuted			0
the attorney general said the @entity13 had the power to take over @entity2 cases , or stop them if they do not meet standards for evidence or public interest			1
mr @entity72 said this had happened in only four of the thousands of cases the charity has brought			0
the @entity2 says it spends £ 5million a year prosecuting cruelty cases , which it insists accounts for just 5p in every pound donated			1
it said the prosecutions department was independent of its campaigning work and that it had a 98 per cent success rate in cases			0
mr @entity50 , mp for @entity97 and @entity98 , said the @entity2 was ‘ not an arm of the law ’ and claimed its relationship with police in offering to investigate such cases was ‘ deeply troubling and part of the problem ’			1
but @entity106 , @entity107 mp for @entity108 , accused mr @entity50 of representing the ‘ hunting lobby ’ and trying to help ‘ rich , powerful @entity110 ’ break the law			0
