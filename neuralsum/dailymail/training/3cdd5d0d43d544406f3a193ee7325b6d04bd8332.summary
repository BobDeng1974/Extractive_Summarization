there 's always got to be that guy who steps it up at a wedding			0
thankfully for this reception , six - year - old @entity4 was there to warm up the dance floor			1
dancing with himself : @entity4 , six , literally warmed up the dance floor at his aunt and uncle 's wedding his @entity13 and @entity14 , who had just tied the knot , were swaying lovingly to @entity16			1
about five other couples were also gently rocking along to the live brass band music , arm - in - arm			1
but @entity4 had other ideas			2
taking advantage of the largely abandoned floor across the hall , the little boy grabbed his head with both hands , lay on his side , and let loose			0
taking it slow : the rest of the guests , plus the bride and groom , were gently swaying to the live brass band according to the cameraman @entity35 , the party - starter was trying to impress a few of the young girls in attendance			1
no doubt they came flocking shortly after			0
@entity40 commented on his video : ' for those who have expressed concern , i assure you that @entity4 is neither epileptic nor autistic ; he is just a fun - loving , energetic kid with a cute dance			2
' i think he may have been trying to impress some girls at the wedding , although i 'm not sure if he picked the best dance for the job ! '			0
