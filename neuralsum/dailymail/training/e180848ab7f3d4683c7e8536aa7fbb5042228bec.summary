by @entity0 @entity1 today imposed a ' full embargo ' on most food imports from the @entity4 in retaliation for sanctions over @entity7 - a sweeping move that will cost @entity4 farmers billions of dollars but could also lead to empty shelves in @entity1 cities			1
the decision shows that president @entity13 has no intention of bowing to @entity4 pressure over @entity7 and will instead try to strike back at the @entity4			0
it also demonstrated that the @entity17 is ready to inflict damage on @entity1 while pursuing its course in @entity7			0
prime minister @entity20 also warned that @entity1 could block transit flights for @entity22 and @entity24 @entity23 to the @entity25			1
' the ban goes into effect immediately and will last one year unless ' our partners demonstrate a constructive approach ' with regards to sanctioning @entity1 , he said			0
' of course this is a serious decision for the suppliers of such foods from these countries			0
' the @entity24 and the @entity47 have accused @entity1 , which annexed @entity7 's @entity61 in march , of fomenting tensions in eastern @entity7 by supplying arms and expertise to a @entity66 insurgency , and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies			1
could lead to empty shelves : shoppers buy imported fruit at a supermarket in @entity76			0
experts say local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban because of poor efficiency and shortage of funds @entity1 depends heavily on imported foodstuffs - most of it from the @entity4 - particularly in the largest and most prosperous cities such as @entity76			2
in 2013 , the @entity47 's agricultural exports to @entity1 totalled 11.8 billion euros ( £ 9.3 billion ) , while the @entity24 @entity89 says food and agricultural imports from the @entity24 amounted to $ 1.3 billion			1
experts said that local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban , as the nation 's agricultural sector has continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds			2
the damage to consumers inflicted by the ban will be felt particularly hard in big cities like @entity76 , where imported food fills an estimated 60 - 70 per cent of the market			0
@entity20 said @entity1 could go further and ban @entity4 carriers from flying over @entity1 on flights to and from @entity25 - a move that would significantly swell costs and increase flight time			1
unrest : the @entity24 and the @entity47 have accused @entity1 of fomenting tensions in @entity7 by supplying arms and expertise to pro-moscow separatists ( above ) who has also been blamed for the shooting down of flight @entity116 he said there has been no decision on that yet , and would n't specify when and under what conditions the move could be taken			1
@entity20 made it clear that @entity1 hopes that the sanctions will make the @entity4 revise its policy and stop trying to pressure @entity1 with sanctions			1
' until the last moment we hoped that our partners would understand that sanctions only lead to a deadlock , and no one needs them , but they did n't , ' he said			0
' we hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations , and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us			0
' if the @entity4 does n't revise its course , @entity1 may follow up by introducing restrictions regarding imports of planes , navy vessels and cars , @entity20 warned , but added that the government will realistically assess its own production potential .			2
