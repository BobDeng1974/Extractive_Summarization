the bleak scenes were captured as part of a series called @entity11 of pools at motels across the @entity14			1
the contrast between the beautiful locations from @entity17 to @entity18 , @entity19 and the grimy , empty pools is striking			2
no diving ! photographer @entity22 traveled around the @entity14 taking pictures of swimming pools attached to abandoned motels like this one in @entity17 grime : this abandoned pool and lawn furniture in @entity29 has see better days the images were shot by photographer @entity22 who traveled around 20,000 miles for the project			1
