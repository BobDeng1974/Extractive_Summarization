the islamic state terror group has issued battlefield guidance to its commanders on how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters			1
the move follows the loss of half of the @entity9 leadership after sustained air strikes from @entity12 planes			1
guidance published in the terrorist group 's magazine @entity14 leaders are told : do n't stand out from the ordinary fighters in case of becoming a target for the enemy ; not to travel more than three to a vehicle ; always wear body armour and a helmet ; use code words to communicate ; and use suicide attackers to raise morale			1
militants : guidance published in the terrorist group 's magazine @entity28 tells commanders how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters the 30 - point plan is published under the name of @entity33 , an @entity9 founding jihadist who was killed by an @entity35 raid on his house in @entity37 in 2010			1
but its prominent publication in the @entity41 magazine yesterday is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the @entity14 leadership death toll : the prominent publication of the battlefield guidance is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the @entity9 leadership according to recent reports @entity9 ' leadership in @entity49 and @entity37 has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes , leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader @entity54			1
coalition warplanes and drones have killed more than 6,000 fighters since september , including more than half the militants serving on @entity9 ' ruling council , @entity35 secretary @entity55 has claimed			1
among the dead jihadis is @entity62 , a former @entity37 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity66 's number two and @entity9 ' most senior militant in @entity37			1
his death and that of as many as nine others on @entity9 ' 18 - man leadership council have forced @entity66 to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders , as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle - hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small			1
many of the commanders have been killed while travelling in convoys between @entity49 and @entity37			1
@entity66 has not been seen in public since july and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes			2
the likelihood , however , is that @entity66 has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months			2
other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of @entity49 and @entity37 that remain under @entity9 ' control			1
this forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead , or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if @entity9 ' rivals on the ground			1
running scared : the battlefield advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about @entity12 surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters point 7 of the 30 - point plan for @entity9 leaders says ' beware of standing out from others by way of the vehicle that you ride or the clothes that you wear			1
. ' and point 11 warns : ' do n't neglect to take what you can of equipment , such as armor and helmets			0
doing so is not cowardice , for @entity133 ( sallallƒÅhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) , the bravest of all people , had armor			0
' number 13 advices : ' you should not have more than three fighters in any car , unless there 's an overriding benefit in doing so			0
' ' the leader should establish a secure , elaborate method of communication between each of the detachments , and establish code words for them to use when communicating , and slogans to shout when they 're fighting			2
' but at the same time the commanders are warned that even in the face of air attacks they are not to ' use security as an excuse ' to spend too much time away from the battlefield			2
leader : @entity54 has not been seen in public since july and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes dead : among the dead jihadis is @entity62 ( left ) , a former @entity37 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity66 's number two and @entity9 ' most senior militant in @entity37			1
another former member of @entity172 's army turned @entity9 commander , @entity173 ( right ) , has also been killed killer : the @entity9 militant known as @entity176 is still free to commit barbaric slaughter , however point 5 warns : ' and beware of using security as an excuse , thereby ensuring your personal security and neglecting your subjects in the process , for what a terrible leader you would then be ! ' the advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about @entity12 surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters			1
it warns : ' and be on guard against your enemy at all times so that he does n't : a. @entity201 on you from near			0
b. assault you from far			0
c. ambush you when you 're inattentive			0
d. @entity204 follow you when you 're returning home			2
' the guidance encourages the punishment of fighters who disobey orders or criticise the leadership : ' punish those who do wrong for their actions , even if by boycotting them , since it 's permissible for a leader to punish those who disobey his orders			2
' ' if you do n't do so , those who perform well will begin to slack , and those who do wrong will become emboldened , things will get worse and your work will be ruined			0
