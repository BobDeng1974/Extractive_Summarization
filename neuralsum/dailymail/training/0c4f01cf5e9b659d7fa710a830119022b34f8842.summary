nostalgic fans of the 1970s video game @entity2 will recall playing it in a video arcade or perhaps on a @entity5			2
now the classic @entity7 game has been beamed into the 21st century - and straight onto the walls of a 29 - storey skyscraper			1
a group of computer scientists commandeered programmable led lights lining the side of a 437ft office building to stage the world 's biggest video game in @entity17			1
@entity40 professor @entity39 and his team transformed the lights - which typically display static images or looping patterns - into a game of @entity2 in the space of a few months , according to a report on arstechnica.com			2
mr @entity39 and his team devised a way of hack the system controlling the led lights - each of which can be lit or unlit in a variety of colours - turning it from something designed to display static images to something interactive			1
the @entity36 lights , each of which has its own internet protocol ( ip ) address , are controlled by a system from @entity68			2
the computer scientist explained how he and his team managed to determine the commands being fed to the lights , in order to interactively turn them on and off			0
one of the scientists created a script capable of analysing a file containing the ip addresses of all of the lights , and mapping out a virtual image of what the lights on the building were displaying at that time			0
mr @entity39 and the rest of the team used this structure to write software that interfaces with the programme controlling the @entity36 lights			0
@entity2 : scientists played the classic @entity7 video game on the facade of the 29 - storey @entity36 in @entity17 lights : professor @entity39 ( second from left ) watches as players @entity96 ( centre ) and @entity98 ( right ) control the game via joysticks on the opposite side of the @entity38 taking in the view : a crowd gathered to watch as the game played out on the office building across the river in @entity17 the scientist and gaming buff first came up with the idea in 2008 , when the patterns of light on the @entity36 one night reminded him of another classic video game ; @entity114			1
' every other night i would just pass by ... but this night i saw @entity114 shapes forming in my mind 's eye , falling down , and that began this long journey to try to make this game possible , ' mr @entity39 said			0
inspiration : @entity40 professor @entity39 first came up with the idea for the giant game of @entity2 back in 2008 code : he and his team wrote the software that interfaces with the programme controlling the @entity36 lights - making the system interactive the professor told his idea was initially ' shot down ' by the owners of the building , the @entity135 , who questioned whether anyone would be interested in a giant version of an outdated video game			1
but after enlisting the support of @entity143 - an event showcasing the city 's technology scene - mr @entity39 managed to secure a meeting with trust ceo @entity146 , who was immediately on board			0
' little kids know @entity2 , grandmothers and grandfathers know @entity2 , and so on , ' said mr @entity39			0
' it is part of our cultural fabric , because it was the first successful commercial video game that launched the multi-billion dollar industry that we have now			0

interactive version of classic game created with led lights on the building
@entity168 gathered to watch @entity2 being played on 29 - storey @entity36
scientists essentially hacked system of lights to make them interactive
