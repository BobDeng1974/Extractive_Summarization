in august 2013 an inquest was told that 86 - year - old patient @entity49 bled to death at the hospital			1
he was said to have died after a drip became detached from his hand and no one noticed for two hours			2
it is thought a male patient died unexpectedly on the high dependency ward in march mr @entity49 had been placed on an antibiotic drip after being admitted to hospital with numerous health complaints including diarrhoea , heart disease , pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver			1
but two hours later he was found collapsed in bed with a pool of blood on the floor after the drip tube feeding him the antibiotics became detached from the cannula - the plastic piece of apparatus connecting the tube to the vein - causing his blood to flow out of the opening			2
staff at @entity7 in @entity81 immediately stopped the bleeding but mr @entity49 went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated			2
recording a narrative verdict , the coroner said mr @entity49 ' died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set ( drip tube apparatus ) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease			0
' the @entity7 also came under scrutiny in 2006 after three women died in childbirth during a four month period			1
all three women were expected to have normal deliveries but died in similar circumstances .			0
