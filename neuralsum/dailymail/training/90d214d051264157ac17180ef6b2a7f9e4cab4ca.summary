for some couples a simple weekend away is enough to make them feel they ’ve got out of the house and experienced something special			0
not for the @entity4 , though			0
husband and wife team @entity5 and @entity9 have spent the past 10 years travelling the world together to remote locations as they photograph wild animals in their most intimate moments			1
the couple from @entity16 have captured some of the most dangerous beasts on our planet going about their daily business in this stunning collection of wildlife images			1
@entity9 , 40 , says it ’s a far cry from her day job as a bathroom supplies account manager or @entity5 ’s as a heating and plumbing engineer			1
' it 's exhilarating , it 's challenging			2
there 's nothing better than sitting under the stars and listening to lions roaring			1
' it 's so different to what we do			2
it 's a release going into the wild and we really do live two different lives			2
the fearless couple leave no stone unturned when it comes to getting the perfect picture , and have converted a @entity67 into a specialist safari vehicle			2
look at our teeth ... @entity9 and @entity5 have been married for 13 years and been on over 50 exotic overseas excursions together up close and personal with an adult male lion as he stares into the lens of the @entity9 's camera in @entity35 @entity5 , 40 , explains the moment their operation went up a notch			1
' we were sitting around a camp fire in @entity35 one night and then we decided to ship our own vehicle over , ’ he says			0
' we bought the car here and completely stripped it down and changed the chassis and the gear box and prepared it for an @entity42 adventure			1
' it has a fridge , a cooker and a roof tent			0
we got it on a container and took it to @entity92			0
it 's kept there and we use it for all our photography			2
' the vehicle is just how we want it so we have photo mounts and we can focus on different species			0
' with their customised equipment they have no problem getting up close to lions , tigers , bears and giraffes in their natural environment - capturing them as they eat , sleep , fight , bond and play			1
' we 've got a good understanding so we never feel in danger , ' said @entity9			1
it 's time for a spot of grooming in this charming image of an adult female cheetah with her offspring ' there can be hairy moments but @entity5 is very capable so i 'm always confident that i have got a man that can get us out			1
' last year , we were sat by a fire in @entity28 and we turned around to see a large female hyena stood just a couple of feet away from us			2
' we 've had all the big animals come into camp and get really close			0
many times we wake up to buffalo or elephants			0
' they usually just nonchalantly pass by and generally avoid us			0
one particular morning we awoke in camp to a buffalo sitting at the base of the ladder to our roof tent			0
' seemed he just wanted a bit of company and security ! so , most of the time it 's really exciting			2
' an adult silverback mountain gorilla takes a load off in @entity151 , showing just how relaxed the animals can be in the @entity4 ' presence @entity5 and @entity9 stand atop their customised @entity67 , which they 've turned into a deluxe safari vehicle perfect for photography a dramatic encounter as female lions ( left ) attack a males in @entity35 - the @entity4 say they never feel in danger among the animals included in their series of images are heartwarming moments of young lion cubs , such as this cuddly - looking beauty in @entity28 giraffes decorate the plains as they all walk in the same direction in this shot taken by the couple in @entity42 @entity5 builds the @entity67 which was designed to help them get better shots of wildlife @entity5 and @entity9 have been married for 13 years after meeting in less than conventional circumstances			1
' i saw @entity5 hanging from a tree because he used to be an arborist , ’ @entity9 says			1
‘ eventually we got together			0
we both had a real love for wildlife before that			0
‘ i dragged him to @entity42 in 2004 and that was the point that we both got hooked			1
’ the pair have since been to that continent more than 40 times			0

' we got more and more into it and then we were n't satisfied with guided tours so that 's when we started self - driving in @entity35			0
’ @entity5 adds : ' both of us love being immersed in natural environment surrounded by wildlife			1
