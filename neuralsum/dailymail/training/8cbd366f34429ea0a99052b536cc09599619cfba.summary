patients are being removed from a mental health hospital after a spot - check inspection found it had a ' disturbing ' number of ' violent incidents '			1
@entity6 has stepped in to transfer all 17 patients in the ' low secure ' ward at @entity9 to other units			2
@entity12 inspectors found it had breached 12 national care and safety regulations when they visited in november after receiving warnings from whistleblowers and the local authority			1
they demanded the hospital make immediate , urgent improvements to protect patients from abuse			1
@entity6 has begun the process of moving mentally ill and vulnerable patients from @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 after it failed a care inspection , which noted a ' disturbing ' number of violent incidents and the wrongful restraint of patients ( file picture posed by a model ) the decision to remove some patients from the hospital in @entity26 , @entity27 , which has beds for 69 , was taken last week after @entity12 inspectors made a return visit			1
inspectors found patients were frequently restrained , had been pinned down and injected with medication , dragged to their rooms by their armpits and had belongings taken away from them as punishment			2
some were regularly restrained in the dangerous face down ' prone ' position – which can cause suffocation – but staff had a ' poor understanding ' of the risk			0
one senior nurse telling inspectors : ' it does n't matter which way you take them down , front ways or back ways			0
' one asthmatic patient was regularly restrained in this way but staff could ' not identify potential increased risks ' of this , while a patient whose restraint was only stopped ' due to head - banging and bleeding from the nose ' was not seen by a doctor			0
patients were restrained 267 times , including 55 times where they were held on the floor , between march and october 2014 but the records were inconsistent and inspectors believed the real number was higher			0
the hospital had informed the @entity12 about police being called seven times during the period , but police had actually attended 22 times , inspectors found			1
there was a high number of ' violent incidents ' , including 334 involving patients and 272 incidences where staff were physically assaulted			0
the @entity12 's report , published on january 29 , said it was ' concerned ' patients were not protected ' from unlawful or excessive restraint '			2
it added : ' we spoke with patients who described unsafe restraint practices			0
' one person described and demonstrated how they said their arm had been hurt , putting their hands together sharply behind their back			0
' @entity106 , @entity12 head of inspection , said : ' the number of violent incidents is disturbing – yet we found little evidence that the provider had the specialist skills or systems to learn from these incidents and prevent them happening in the first place			2
' although inspectors ' observed examples of calm , caring interactions ' on some wards , staff were described as lacking ' understanding of patient needs '			0
they referred to patients as being ' demanding ' , ' attention seeking ' and wanting to get their ' own way '			0
the report said : ' we were concerned about their competency to care for people safely			0
' the 17 patients being removed were all on @entity132 , a male low secure unit			0
the @entity12 inspection found there were not always enough staff to care for people safely and that some staff and patients said they did n't feel safe on the wards ( file picture posed by models ) @entity9 agreed not to take on any more patients following the november inspection and brought in a new management team			1
however , the @entity12 referred it to @entity6 last week to begin removing patients from one ward after deadlines it set for improvement passed			1
a spokesman for @entity6 said : ' @entity153 has failed to maintain safe standards of care and treatment for the vulnerable patients in its care			1
' the first priority for all @entity6 commissioners is to make sure that all patients currently at @entity153 are safe and well cared for			1
' commissioners , working with the @entity12 have acted promptly and already begun the process of transferring these patients , some with complex needs , to centres that can provide care to the appropriate standards			1
' @entity6 supports the enforcement action taken by the @entity12 , and will continue to work with partners in monitoring the progress of all actions required of @entity153			2
' @entity153 said its new team was working ' to ensure that the highest levels of patient welfare and safety are restored '			0
it said @entity12 and @entity6 had ' temporarily suspended our ability to care for low secure male patients ' , and it would work closely with both bodies ' to implement the improvements we all agree necessary ' .			1
