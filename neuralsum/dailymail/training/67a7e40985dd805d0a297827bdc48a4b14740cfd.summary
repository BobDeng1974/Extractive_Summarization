almost a year ago in may 2013 the world ’s first gun made with a 3d printer was unveiled			1
at the time it sparked major controversy – some derided it as nothing more than a toy , others warned it was a serious security risk that was undetectable by metal detectors			0
now , one year on , the chilling reality of 3d - printed guns has been revealed as enthusiasts across the world show off their ‘ toys ’			1
in may 2013 @entity16 showed off the world 's first fully 3d - printed gun , known as the @entity19 ( pictured )			1
now , one year one , users of the online community fosscad reveal to @entity22 how far the technology has progressed , and how dangerous it could become in the future a multitude of videos on @entity27 show just how 3d - printed guns have come in 12 months			1
the first was unveiled by @entity16 , a 25 - year - old law student at the @entity29			2
the @entity30 exposed the international security risk posed by a gun that can be easily made with new 3d printers last year			2
they built a weapon , which is capable of firing a live round , from blueprints available on the internet – then smuggled it on to a packed @entity40 train			0
two reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport - style security to carry the gun on to a @entity45 to @entity47 service in the weekend rush - hour , alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers			2
the pistol , capable of firing a deadly 0.38 - calibre bullet , was produced in under 36 hours using a revolutionary £ 1,700 machine to ‘ print ’ its components			0
and because all the parts are plastic , they did not trigger the metal detectors all euro - star passengers must pass through			0
his primitive design was the @entity61 – but that proof of concept has been vastly improved since may 2013			0
@entity64 - printing gun enthusiasts now gather at a website called @entity66 ( @entity67 )			1
here , users share their designs for 3d - printed guns , which can be downloaded by anyone			1
with a 3d printer , technically anyone can then download one of the designs and print their own gun			2
@entity22 spoke to some of the users on @entity79 about how it has changed over the last year			1
some were keen to stress that these guns are not always that easy to make			0
they require a decent knowledge of @entity64 and assembly			0
and , it was pointed out that while most of the gun can be printed there are some things that can not , such as ammo - although not for lack of trying			2
but they did agree that these guns would be use to seriously harm and even kill people , just like regular guns - with the difference being the designs for 3d - printed guns can be downloaded from the internet			1
for countries like the @entity101 , where firearms are much harder to come by than in the @entity103 , the availability of these designs does prove a considerable danger			0
in one @entity27 video a @entity107 ' @entity106 ' revolver , named by its maker , can be seen in action			0
@entity111 , the man behind the video , was recently arrested in @entity107 for owning 3d - printed firearm components			1
this image shows how close the community is to making a machine gun with a barrel , as shown here , with a 3d - printer			1
' everything in blue can be 3d - printed , ' says user @entity121 , although he does not know if the whole gun will ever be able to be printed while guns can be 3d printed , the users say that getting ammo for them would be a lot more difficult			1
efforts have been made to @entity64 ammo , with limited success , but the guns themselves are developing at an astounding rate from simple contraptions to rifles and revolvers ( pictured ) ‘ a big misconception is that 3d printing and making guns using 3d printers are easy to make , ’ said one user , @entity121 , who goes as ' ma deuce ' on @entity27			2
‘ we have been doing this for years and i can say it ’s not easy			0
’ @entity121 points out that the group has been working on making 3d components for guns for about two years – it ’s only in the past year almost entirely printed guns have been conceived			1
‘ in the @entity101 you ca n’t buy gun parts easily , ’ @entity121 says , ‘ so you would be limited to the liberator type guns			2
’ for a complete novice who had no knowledge of 3d printers or guns it would take ‘ probably a few months to do it well , to print it ’ and then assemble the design into a weapon			2
in the last year stronger designs have been devised for guns like the @entity61 , while they also have higher capacity			2
the first gun could hold just one bullet , but now some have revolving barrels that can hold six or more			0
‘ let me be clear , in a few years our design will be excellent , we hope , ’ says @entity121			0
‘ that is the goal			0
’ at the moment however , according to another user called @entity174 , ‘ someone could cause more harm with a hammer than with a @entity61			0
’ there are a number of 3d - printed gun designs now freely available on the web			1
the first fully 3d - printed gun ( save for the ammo ) , the @entity61 , is capable of killing someone			1
before the @entity19 initial efforts to make guns from plastic usually exploded when attempts were made to fire bullets			0
this proof of concept gun , however , showed that making a lethal weapon out of plastic is entirely possible			0
since then a number of other guns have sprung up on the web			0
in late 2013 a gun enthusiast in @entity198 showed off a working firearm called the @entity19 , made from less than £ 15 ( $ 25 ) worth of plastic , that could fire .38 calibre bullets without being damaged			0
in july , meanwhile , a @entity27 user showed off ‘ @entity203 , a 3d - printed rifle capable of firing .22 - calibre bullets			1
these guns were one - shot only – the barrel had to be removed after each shot – but in august another gun enthusiast unveiled the @entity211 , capable of holding and firing five bullets			1
the alarming speed at which the technology has progressed shows how close these guns are to accurately mimicking real - life weapons			2
even as users of @entity218 play down the danger of them , the sight of guns made from plastic being created is unnerving			2
and the fact they are made of plastic and not metal means they can be taken through metal detectors without being picked up			0
for the moment , though , ammo and firing pins must still be metal			0
but there is a possibility that in future entire guns could be 3d - printed - including the ammo			1
designs for 3d - printed guns , like the @entity211 seen here , can quite easily be downloaded by anybody from popular sites like @entity66			1
however , the users of the site maintain that actually making the guns and using a 3d - printer is not as easy as it looks , although it is possible for someone to become an expert in a few months over the past year the various designs have increased in their complexity and performance			1
the next 12 months could see them get even better until they are on a par with real guns , according to users on the site @entity64 printed guns jumped to the top of agendas worldwide when governments realised they could be taken through metal detectors without setting them off			1
the users point out that the guns need a metal firing pin and ammo , however , which would set a metal detector off			2
but they seem almost nonchalant about the potential dangers of these weapons , with a genuine enthusiasm for making them			0
‘ i ’m not in it for the fame , i just love guns and the art of designing them , ’ says @entity121			0
and on the availability of the designs for someone to print a gun , @entity121 says : ‘ if i put a gun on the table in front of you would you pick it up and shoot me ? ’ since a year ago the community has a lot more parts and working types of guns , and the users see this continuing for the next year			1
for now , though , the guns are still in their relative infancy and the designs have yet to be perfected			0
but will a @entity64 printed gun ever be as powerful as a real gun ? ' definitely , ' says @entity121 .			1

it is one year since the first 3d - printed gun was unveiled to the world
over the last 12 months the designs have become better and better
many enthusiasts across the globe have been showing off their designs
@entity22 spoke to several users of 3d - printing gun site @entity79
some *suggested* the guns could be on a par with real guns in a year or two
