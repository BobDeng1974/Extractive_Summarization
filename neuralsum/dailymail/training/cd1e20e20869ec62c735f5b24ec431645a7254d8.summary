by @entity1 reporter a long - lost cat that disappeared more than a decade ago surprised its owner when it turned up sitting outside her house last week			1
@entity5 vanished from her remote home in @entity7 in the @entity8 , which has a population of around 800 , in 2003			1
despite it being 11 years since she went missing - owner @entity11 , 39 , instantly recognised the 16 - year - old cat because of her distinctive markings			1
mrs @entity11 said that wherever @entity5 has been she has certainly been alright for food @entity5 's owner has no idea where she has spent the last 11 years but are glad to have her back she said : ' i thought i was going mad			1
but i was so sure it was @entity5			1
' i called out her name and she turned around immediately , and then she started yowling			0
mrs @entity11 and 41 - year - old husband @entity21 both thought they had seen @entity5 a couple of weeks before she came home , but had convinced themselves it was n’t			1
' we thought there was no way it could be @entity5			1
but how wrong we were			0
' i still ca n't quite believe it			0
' but the mother of two , who works in social care , said the cat ’s distinct markings leave the couple in no doubt about its identity			2
she said : ' it 's definitely our @entity5			1
there 's absolutely no doubt it 's her			0
i really could n't begin to tell you where she 's been all these years			0
mrs @entity11 got @entity5 when she was a tiny kitten back in 1998 @entity11 said she could n't believe the cat came back after more than a decade @entity5 sits by the window as if thinking whether to embark upon another adventure ' i think she 's been living feral as her fur was very thick and matted when she came back			1
but she 's fat enough			0
she 's looked after herself in her years away			0
the vet actually said she looks younger than her 16 years			0
' mrs @entity11 , who first got @entity5 in 1998 when she was just a kitten , said : ' we got her as a baby with her brother @entity52			1
she was always the more feral cat			2
' she would go out and stay away for a few days , but then come back			0
so when she went missing at first we thought she would just come back when she was ready			2
@entity5 is back living in @entity7 , a remote village with a population of around 800 ' but eventually we thought she must have died or be living wild and we just put her out of our minds			1
' @entity52 was missing her so we got another kitten , and we 've had several different cats over the years			2
' @entity5 is now settled in with the family and is learning to get on with fellow cat @entity59 - but mrs @entity11 said she ca n't be sure how long the wandering cat will stay			1
a vet said the wandering cat looked younger than her 16 years she said : ' i like to think that she 's come back to spend her twilight years with us			2
but she 's very independent and everything 's on her terms			0
' i sometimes look at her and think i just ca n't believe she 's actually home			0
i do n't think we 'll ever fully know what she 's been up to the past ten years or so			0
' but she 's still very much our @entity5 and we hope she 'll stay around for a while at least			2

@entity5 has been missing from her remote @entity8 home since 2003
last week owner @entity11 found her sitting outside the house
the 39 - year - old has no idea where the cat has spent the last decade
