@entity1 flag - bearer @entity0 kissed his right knee after beating fierce rival and compatriot @entity4 to retain his @entity5 singles squash title			1
@entity0 , 34 , only had knee surgery five weeks ago , yet came through a five - game thriller to become the first man since sprinter @entity10 in 2002 to carry the flag at the opening ceremony and go on to win @entity5 gold			1
the world no 1 , who fell out with @entity4 after sledging him in the 2009 @entity17 final , was taken into a deciding game by the 30 - year - old , but came through 11 - 5			2
court in the act : @entity0 celebrates winning @entity5 gold in squash full @entity1 : @entity1 's @entity0 ( c ) , @entity4 ( @entity23 ) and @entity24 cleaned up in the squash @entity26 : day 5 review @entity0 said : ‘ @entity4 is so good that i ca n’t play good squash against him			1
he brings out the worst in me			0
all i can do is just whack it to the back because he ’s so good			0
if it was a boxing match i think they would have thrown the towel in , but i managed to dig in			2
‘ i ’m a @entity34 , an only child and a @entity36			0
put that together and you ’ve got one hell of a stubborn so - and - so			2
’ in control : @entity1 's @entity0 ( left ) plays a shot during his gold medal match with @entity4 ( right ) on the stretch : @entity44 ( left ) leans forward to make a shot at @entity46 @entity1 ’s @entity47 , 30 , suffered double pain as she was beaten 3 - 0 in the final of the women ’s singles by world no 1 @entity52 and bashed in the face by her opponent ’s racket			1
to make matters worse , @entity47 then lost the point in question to the @entity60 after attempting to appeal to the video review system			0
‘ i was disappointed with that , ’ said @entity47 , who had a game point to go 1 - 0 up but then lost the next two games 11 - 2 and 11 - 5 in just 20 minutes			1
‘ but ultimately my squash was n’t good enough today			0
a silver is probably about what i deserved			0
