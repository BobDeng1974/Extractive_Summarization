by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 4 october 2013 millions of men over 50 are more at risk of dying from cancer than women because they still do not recognise the symptoms and refuse to see a doctor			2
experts warn there has been little improvement in men ’s knowledge of the disease , and in their unhealthy lifestyles , despite a series of awareness campaigns			1
each year around 82,500 men in the @entity17 lose their lives to cancer , making it the leading cause of death in the male population			1
concerns : according to survey of 12,000 over- 50 's almost half do not know the signs of prostate or bowel cancer one man dies every hour from prostate cancer			1
according to a survey of 12,000 over- 50s , almost half do not know the signs of prostate or bowel cancer , while women are better informed			1
a similar number do not visit their gp about health problems , with one in four refusing to do so even if they are in severe pain			1
more than a fifth need to be chivvied into seeing their doctor by worried family members			0
the survey also shows almost two - thirds of men do not eat the recommended five - a - day of fruit and vegetables , compared with half of women , and one in five does not exercise			2
the findings come after figures revealed cancer death rates in the @entity17 are more than a third higher in men than in women			1
confidence : a posthumous advert featuring @entity60 , who died from prostate cancer , inspired men to be more vigilant with the disease although the difference is partly due to men developing hard - to - treat cancers such as those affecting the bladder , oesophagus and liver , doctors and charities also blame men for not paying attention to their health			1
the death of entertainer @entity60 from prostate cancer ten years ago led to a posthumous tv advert five years later which used special effects to show him urging men to be vigilant			0
but only 59 per cent know the symptoms of prostate cancer , which is predicted to be the most common cancer by 2030			0
signs include trouble urinating and blood in the urine			0
by contrast , 82 per cent of women can identify breast cancer signs			0
men are also less likely to recognise bowel cancer , with 55 per cent saying they would know the symptoms compared with almost three - quarters of women			0
meanwhile , just over a third of men know how to spot lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer of both sexes – compared with half of women			2
slightly more are aware of skin cancer , with 54 per cent of men knowing the signs compared with 71 per cent of women			2
@entity105 , of @entity106 , said men can be too embarrassed to talk and leave it too late before visiting gps			0
‘ bowel cancer is more treatable if spotted and diagnosed early , ’ he said			0
the survey , by @entity112 , found the eventual rate of prostate cancer in boys born today will triple compared with the current rate , of around 41,000 men a year			2
@entity118 , of @entity17 , said : ‘ we all need to generate more open conversations about men ’s health and we hope that with the likes of @entity124 [ who has been treated for prostate cancer ] speaking out about their personal experiences , more men will be inspired to seek advice			1
‘ prostate cancer kills one man every hour but it can be treated if caught early enough			0

around 82,500 men in the @entity17 lose their lives to cancer every year
survey of 12,000 over- 50s say almost half do not know the signs
