was there ever a government quango quite so useless as the @entity2 ? from its infamous ‘ barbecue summer ’ washout of 2009 to the snowbound winter it failed to predict in 2010 and the recent forecast - defying floods , our £ 200 million - a - year official weather forecaster has become a national joke			1
but of all its recent embarrassments , none come close to matching the @entity2 ’s latest one			2
without fanfare — apparently in the desperate hope no one would notice — it has finally conceded what other scientists have known for ages : there is no evidence that ‘ global warming ’ is happening			1
a chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the @entity23 off the north coast of @entity25 in @entity26			0
the @entity2 has conceded there is no evidence that ' global warming ' is happening the @entity2 quietly readjusted its temperature projections on its website on @entity32			1
until then , it had been confidently predicting temperature rises of at least 0.2 degrees per decade , with a succession of years exceeding even the record - breaking high of 1998			2
its latest chart , however , confirmed in a press release earlier this week , tells a very different story : no more global warming is expected till at least 2017			1
according to dr @entity40 of the independent think - tank the @entity42 , the climbdown could n’t be more dramatic or more devastating for the @entity2 ’s credibility			2
all the predictions they ’ve been making about man - made global warming these past 20 years have started to come crashing about their ears			1
’ for two decades the @entity2 has acted as @entity50 ’s foremost cheerleader for climate change alarmism			2
in 2007 , its @entity52 for climate change research produced a briefing document for the government claiming its state - of - the - art computer models left no doubt : man - made global warming was a very real threat which needed to be addressed urgently by policy - makers			1
‘ the @entity52 has the highest concentration of outstanding people who do outstanding work , spanning the breadth of modelling , attribution , and date analysis , of anywhere in the world , ’ claimed an expert from the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) in the document			2
many in the government were impressed for , a year later , the 2008 @entity74 was passed by an overwhelming majority			0
the act has been described by veteran journalist @entity79 as the most expensive legislation in history , committing the government to as much as £ 734 billion ( £ 18.3 billion a year for the next 40 years ) in extra spending to ‘ decarbonise ’ the economy			1
it is also one of the reasons why our countryside is being ruined by ugly , noisy wind turbines			0
but what if carbon dioxide is n’t the culprit for global temperature changes ? what if all the expensive , economy - ravaging , job - killing , environmentally destructive measures we ’ve taken have been a spectacular waste of money ? if so , the @entity2 will be attacked for being not just risibly incompetent — but an active menace both to the integrity of science and to the nation ’s wellbeing			1
hence its defiant attempts to argue that nothing has changed and it ’s business as usual			0
‘ the fact the new model predicts less warming , globally , for the coming five years does not necessarily tell us anything about long - term predictions of climate change for the coming century , ’ it claimed yesterday			1
in other words : ‘ never mind that global warming stopped in 1997			1
it will come back with a vengeance one day			0
we ’re just not quite so sure when			0
’ according to the @entity2 , @entity50 is apparently experiencing more rain by volume and intensity but according to the @entity2 's own data - the @entity122 and @entity123 precipitation records dating back to 1766 - there has been nothing particularly abnormal about the recent rain the @entity2 confirmed in a press release earlier this week that no more global warming is expected till at least 2017 this latest embarrassment comes just days after the @entity2 was lambasted for yet another misleading claim , about the recent flooding			1
it said this is part of a growing national trend towards ‘ extreme ’ weather — as also heavily promoted by the @entity136 ’s environmental analyst @entity135 , and by scaremongering documentaries such as @entity138 ’s @entity139 getting worse ? according to the @entity2 , @entity50 is apparently experiencing more rain by volume and intensity			1
‘ we have always seen a great deal of variability in @entity50 extreme rainfall because our weather patterns are constantly changing , but this analysis suggests we are seeing a shift in our rainfall behaviour , ’ said the @entity2 ’s top scientist , professor @entity142			1
‘ there ’s evidence to say we are getting slightly more rain in total , but more importantly it may be falling in more intense bursts — which can increase the risk of flooding			0
’ but these claims appeared to be at best a dangerous fudge , at worst a complete nonsense			0
as is clear from the @entity2 ’s own data — the @entity122 and @entity123 precipitation records dating back to 1766 — there has been nothing particularly abnormal about the recent rain			0
not only were there two years , 1872 and 1768 , wetter than the supposed record - breaking year of 2012 ; but also , the @entity2 appeared to have overlooked two very dry years ( 2003 and 2011 ) to prove its narrative that the past ten years			1
the @entity42 ’s dr @entity40 believes the very notion of ‘ extreme ’ weather is an unscientific nonsense			2
‘ if you were to pick any period in history , you would soon find an example of an unusual weather event — maybe a heatwave in @entity177 or fires in @entity179			0
@entity42 's dr @entity40 believes the very notion of ' extreme ' weather is a nonsense			0
he said you could find examples in any period of history event , such as the fires in @entity179 ‘ somewhere in the world , a weather record is being broken almost every day			0
what ’s not normal is when people try to impose on it some kind of invented trend			0
’ this is what happened just yesterday , when the scorching @entity179 heatwave that has caused bushfires was linked in both @entity195 and @entity196 to global warming			1
the @entity2 has subscribed to this sort of stance since at least 1990 , when it became politicised under its then director @entity200 — the fanatical believer in the great global warming religion , who was also responsible for setting up the @entity63			1
under @entity200 ’s stewardship , it became an article of faith that not only was man - made global warming real and dangerous , but that it was the primary job of the @entity2 to spread the alarmist gospel			1
dr @entity40 notes that this is a sad betrayal of the @entity2 ’s traditional role : ‘ when it comes to four or five - day weather forecasting , the @entity2 is the best in the world , ’ he says			1
‘ the tragedy is that , for the most part , the @entity2 thinks weather forecasting is beneath it			2
climate change is more glamorous — and brings in more money			0
’ and the @entity2 ’s obsession with climate change has wreaked havoc with its medium to long - term forecasting			2
that infamous ‘ barbecue summer ’ and its inability to foresee last november ’s floods were the result of the same major flaw in its system : its computer models are all programmed on the assumption that as global @entity231 levels increase , so will global warming			1
this means they ’re continually predicting warmer weather , in contradiction of all the real world evidence			0
for two decades , the @entity2 has abused its position of trust , authority and taxpayer - funded privilege to promote green ideology at the expense of scientific integrity			2
never mind the mere £ 200 million we pay a year to fund the @entity2 ’s dodgy , @entity250 prognostications : the real bill for its incompetence runs into the billions			1
on march , 7 2013 @entity253 , @entity2 chairman wrote : ' @entity255 ’s views misrepresent the @entity2 ’s reputation for world - class weather and climate forecasting and research ( @entity261 )			2
the @entity50 can be rightly proud the @entity2 is among the world ’s top two national weather forecasting services			2
we ’re proud that , in independent surveys , more than 90 per cent of the public regard our warnings as useful , and more than 80 per cent of the @entity50 public trust our forecasts and warnings			0
this respect for our professionalism and impartiality hasbeen built over 150 years of forecasting for the nation			0
we aim to use our world - leading scientific expertise to protect life and property and increase prosperity and wellbeing right across the @entity50			0
we provide impartial services ranging from forecasts and warnings to the public ; services to transport operators , so we can fly , drive or sail safely ; and advice to the energy , retail and health sectors so we can all go about our daily lives safely and efficiently			0
our forecasts on radio , tv , mobile phone apps and newspapers are a source of daily interest as well as essential advice to the public			0
whatever a journalist ’s views are about climate change — and they have a right to air them — let ’s not degrade the institutions on which the public rely			0

the £ 200 million - a - year official weather forecaster often gets it wrong
this week it has admitted there is no evidence that ‘ global warming ’ is happening
