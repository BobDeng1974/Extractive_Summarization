there is always a risk when buying clothes online - sometimes the fabric feels cheap , or the colour just does n't seem to match how it appeared on screen			2
or the fit could be far less flattering in real life than online - as one woman has just discovered			0
the @entity10 shopper bought a risqu√© black dress - which featured a full length sheer panel - from @entity15 site @entity13			1
online shopping fail ! a woman in @entity10 has been left disgruntled after the daring dress she bought online fell short of her expectations the gown , a copy of one worn by @entity23 actress @entity21 at the film 's premiere in 2013 , features features top - to - bottom see - through panels on the front and back of the dress , which mean concealing the wearer 's modesty is something of a challenge			1
while the customer was hoping to emulate the daring look shown online , the real deal turned out to be less glamorous than she hoped			1
from sexy to @entity38 : the cut - out dress , purchased from @entity15 site @entity13 , revealed a lot more than the customer expected fully exposed : the full - length sheer panels show off plenty of skin front and back the unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller 's page , showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended			1
stretched across a less petite figure , the sheer panel shows off a lot more skin and covers less of her intimate regions , turning what was a daring look into a rather more x-rated one			1
the shopper 's pink slippers do little to help the sartorial situation as they stuck out obviously from underneath her dress , giving her a humorous look			0
@entity65 copy : the dress is a copy of one worn by @entity23 actress @entity68 at the film 's 2013 premiere @entity68 made headlines when she walked the red carpet in the designer version of the dress 18 months ago			1
the actress raised eyebrows as she risked wardrobe malfunctions in every direction , with her daring dress skirting dangerously close to her nipples , bikini line and bottom			1
however , her washboard stomach and statuesque figure did go some way in helping to pull off the shocking look			0
this is n't the first time though that disgruntled online shoppers have been let down			2
earlier this year many women took to the internet to lament the fact that the dresses they had ordered looked nothing like the pictures they had been shown			0
most of those duped were brides looking for an alternative to buying their wedding dress from an expensive bridal store			0
many websites offer cheap copies of designer gowns , made in the @entity105 - but instead of using lace from @entity108 , what arrives is polyester from @entity10			0
here are some of the worst ... this dusty pink number appeared subtle and classy ( left ) however in reality it was a shade of bubble gum pink with plastic crystals ( right ) this @entity119 dress appeared opulent with a full bodied shirt online ( left ) , however in reality it was lackluster ( right ) did this get put in the wash with the green socks ? a case of colour confusion when this dress arrived , right this multicoloured gown appeared to make a statement ( left ) but the version that was delivered barely made a whisper ( right ) left : what the bride expected			2
right : what arrived on the doorstep			0
the lace sleeves are missing the lace			0
