by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 30 may 2013 with her long legs and trim figure , model @entity1 from @entity2 has a body many women would envy			1
but even models get hang - ups about their appearance and for @entity1 , it was her ' muffin top '			1
she felt she had fat hanging over her waistline that made her feel self - conscious when doing bikini shoots			1
but the solution the 22 - year - old sought to boost her confidence left her self - esteem lower than ever			1
bad result : @entity1 was left with red and lumpy scars after having liposuction risk : the angry scars were a result of @entity1 getting an infection after her treatment she said : ' the procedure that was meant to improve my confidence has left me feeling worse than i did beforehand			1
' from a young age i was conscious of my ' muffin top ' so i went for liposuction thinking it would improve my confidence			2
' @entity1 spent Â£ 2,600 to have the cosmetic procedure where fat is sucked from the body			2
she booked the treatment and paid for it in advance but by the time she went to have it , she had lost some pounds naturally so it was no longer necessary			1
however as she did n't want to lose her money she went through with it regardless			0
she said : ' when i went to my consultant i felt i did n't need it but i had already paid all the money up front			0
i would have lost that if i did n't do it so i felt i had to go through with it			0
i wish i had thought about it more			0
' last chance : @entity1 meets mr @entity53 who she hopes can solve her problem diagnosis : the surgeon said the scars should have faded after two years and the only option would be to cut them out liposuction involves making incisions in the skin so a suction tube can then be inserted to suck fat out			1
as with all surgery , the treatment comes with a risk of the wounds getting infected afterwards and unfortunately for @entity1 , this happened to her			1
after treatment for the infection she was left with lumpy , red scars that still had n't faded two years after the liposuction			1
three weeks later : after mr @entity53 's treatment , @entity1 's scar are fainter and not as lumpy as they were before she said : ' they 're red and inflamed and lumpy and can be quite sore			2
the procedure has been so disappointing and left me feeling self conscious			2
' the scars also affected the work @entity1 felt she could take on in her modelling career			1
@entity1 hoped the @entity85 tv show @entity84 could be her salvation			0
she revealed her scars to the show 's resident cosmetic surgeon mr @entity53 who said , ' they should have gone by now			0
' he said the only solution would be for @entity1 to go under the knife again under local anesthetic so he could cut out the old scars			2
the treatment was a success and @entity1 returned to the salon three weeks later to show off the results			2
her scars were now less red , painful and lumpy and mr @entity53 told her they would continue to fade as time passed			0
confidence restored : the scars will continue to fade and the model now feels ready to return to doing bikini shoots @entity1 revealed that the treatment had given her the confidence boost she needed and as a result , she had secured a job in @entity110 over the summer modelling swimwear			1
she said : ' i 'm really excited i 'm going to be modelling bikinis in @entity110			0
it 's something i would never have been able to do as the scars were before			0
' watch @entity84 on this evening at 10pm on @entity85 ( @entity116 125 and @entity117 167 )			0
if you have a botched beauty treatment you 'd like fixed by the @entity120			0
they 're currently looking for people who 've suffered disastrous hair dos , bad fillers and other cosmetic calamities to be put right for the new series			0

@entity1 , 22 , felt self - conscious about her body
she paid *upfront* to have liposuction
but by the time she had treatment she no longer *weighed* enough to need it
her wounds were infected and she was left with angry scars
she said : ' it has left me feeling worse than i did beforehand '
