@entity0 insists he is yet to decide who he will be recommending to be @entity4 's 2016 @entity3 captain but says a new man will be appointed in the next two months			1
@entity0 inspired @entity4 to a 16.5 - 11.5 victory over the @entity7 in september and is now tasked with choosing a successor to lead the team in @entity10 next year			1
the selection panel will include former captains @entity12 and @entity14 , as well @entity16 officials , but @entity0 's opinion is likely to carry particular weight after his triumph at @entity20			1
@entity0 , pictured holding the trophy , captained @entity4 to @entity3 success during the summer he said : ' i have n't fully made my mind up yet about who i 'm going to recommend			1
' we 're still communicating , there are a number of people involved in making that decision - current players , potential players going forward , and people who are associated with the @entity3			2
' i 'm gathering information from everyone and i want to get a really solid view of what everybody thinks before i bring my ideas forward			0
' we 're working on it and in the next couple of months we 'll have a new captain in place and the wheels will be turning towards another @entity3			2
' @entity44 is the strong favourite to take the post having played in the @entity3 five times and helped lead the team as vice-captain in 2010			1
@entity0 's relationship with @entity44 , however , remains strained after @entity44 withdrew his support for @entity0 's bid to lead the side in 2014 and suggested he may not have the presence to face @entity7 captain @entity55			1
' would @entity44 be a good captain ? the one thing i can not do is express an opinion on that , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 watches on as @entity61 @entity60 kisses the @entity3 trophy ' i 'll talk about it afterwards but at this moment it 's only right i stay neutral and am fair to all the candidates			1
' when i was trying to be captain , all i wanted was to be treated fairly by everybody so i think it 's important i do the same now i 'm involved in the decision making process			0
' @entity0 drew on a wide variety of experience to help him lead at @entity20 and he says he would be happy to offer his advice to future teams , but only if it was called upon			0
' of course i would be happy to help going forward , ' @entity0 said			0
' i 'm @entity4 through and through and have been involved in six @entity76 and have a lot of experience			0
' whoever is @entity3 captain though , it 's important he captains how he sees fit and does n't try to copy me or anybody else before			2
' it 's important the captain is true to himself and captains the way he thinks is best to get a result for @entity4			2
@entity44 is the strong favourite to take the post having played in the @entity3 five times ' but if anybody wants to have a conversation with me , i certainly would be very happy to do so			1
' in contrast to @entity0 , @entity55 's leadership style was one of many factors blamed for @entity7 's loss last year and a @entity3 @entity96 has since been established to unearth a way of beating the @entity4			1
@entity0 , however , believes there is one explanation that may have been overlooked			0
' for all the fall - out over there , there 's never been a whole lot of recognition of what a formidable opponent @entity4 has become , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity106 is producing great players and then there are the experienced players who make the team time after time			0
' we have the world number one player saying he was more up for the @entity3 singles than he was for the last round of two majors last year			0
' that just shows how important it 's become for @entity4			0
' our players are dominating the top of the world rankings and we were playing at home			0
we were a very , very tough opponent			0
