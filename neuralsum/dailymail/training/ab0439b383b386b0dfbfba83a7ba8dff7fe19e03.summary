by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:13 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 11:37 est , 18 july 2013 every member of staff at a cash - strapped council has been given a share of a £ 852,000 bonus pot , it emerged today			1
@entity9 , which has over seen budget cuts of millions of pounds , signed off the £ 250 windfall for each of its 3,731 administration staff			1
critics condemned the move as ‘ bonkers ’ as council leaders claimed it would save money in the long run			1
bonus time : @entity23 - led @entity9 signed off the £ 250 payments to staff despite losing millions in budget cuts full - time staff are in line for £ 250 with part - time workers receiving a payment on a pro-rata basis			1
it was never discussed at an official council meeting but was agreed informally by cabinet members and senior managers			1
the council claims the bonus was agreed , partly to compensate staff for the end of its incremental pay increases where workers used to get an additional pay rise for each year ’s service			1
@entity45 , the campaign manager for the @entity46 , said : ‘ it ’s shocking that the council is paying out bonuses , regardless of what they want to try and call them			0
‘ it ’s bonkers that the council acknowledges the financial pressures it faces yet still deems it sensible to hand already well paid staff a bonus and a pay rise			2
‘ the council needs to cut out wasteful and unnecessary spending so they can ease the pressure on hard pressed residents footing the local authority ’s pay bill			2
’ council leaders claimed the move will save move only officials working in the main administration will get the bonus , with specialists like teachers or firefighters left out			0
@entity9 leader @entity73 said : ‘ making this one - off payment very much marks the end of incremental salary increases which can cost an authority of our size significant sums of money			2
‘ this payment is being made on a pro-rata basis			0
as the majority of our staff are part - time , they will not receive the full amount			2
‘ in the long run , the changes we are making to staff pay will save the authority money			0
’ however , @entity94 , the @entity95 on the council , said : ‘ i am surprised that this was not on the agenda to be discussed before it was decided - especially as we are always hearing what a financial black hole we are staring into			0
‘ quite honestly if there is this money available i would rather have seen it use to benefit the lowest - paid staff , to introduce the living wage			0
‘ while £ 250 is a good sum , it will not be that much for people on more than £ 25,000 , but if this money was spent to lift the wages of those at the bottom it could have made a real difference - but there was no chance to discuss the decision			1
’ a spokesman for @entity9 said : ‘ this payment is in recognition of our employees ’ on - going commitment to the authority during what continues to be a challenging time for local government			1
‘ it is also against the background of the removal of all incremental salary increases			0
corporate single status staff will also receive a 1 per cent cost of living increase in their salary			0
‘ this is in line with a national agreement between unions and employers			0

@entity9 agreed £ 250 payments for every staff member
deal was never discuss at official meeting but signed off by officials
critics condemn the ' bonkers ' decision at a time of deep spending cuts
