' author an activist @entity7 , 35 , said the signs of her condition were already appearing shortly after she turned 13 and would no longer respond to someone calling her name from another room ' fifteen years ago , i was told that , by now , there would be something to help stop the progression of this , and potentially even a cure , ' she tells the @entity34			1
' part of me feels really angry that people could be so careless , to promise something like that			1
' but sadly that was not to be the case			1
' the words pounded like a drumbeat in my head , ' she remembers of her diagnosis			2
' no cure , no stopping it			2
' she grew up in @entity49 , @entity50 , with two brothers , and though their father had fits of mania and depression and her parents divorced when she was 12 she still describes her childhood as ' idyllic			2
' but as she got older , he parents argued over how to deal with her diagnosis with her father wanting @entity14 's new book ' not fade away ' will detail her struggles with @entity16 syndrome to keep the truth from her as long as possible so she could enjoy her childhood			1
' at the time , my night vision was the most significantly impaired , ' she says			1
' so my dad said , ‘ we can tell her she has difficulty seeing at night , and in time we ’ll get to that place where we ’ll tell her more			2
’ ' to this day she is uncertain exactly how her parents finally revealed the truth to her , only being driven to a conference for the @entity73 at the age of 15			1
the trip was her first exposure to guide dogs , canes , and people her age who were already completely blind			1
she remembers being unnerved when a woman who 's vision was impaired was unable to maintain direct eye contact in a conversation as her eyes drifted to the right			1
' i remember looking at her and wondering what she could see , ' she says			2
she describes her site today as ' the end of one of those old @entity94 cartoons on tv , where @entity96 sits in the center of the screen waving goodbye as the picture becomes an increasingly smaller hole , until it ’s finally gone , leaving only blackness			2
that ’s all , folks			2
' it 's a life she once thought she 'd rather die than deal with			2
' i just could n’t imagine living into adulthood , ' she tells @entity108			2
' i could n’t imagine what that would mean			2
' she dealt with the fear by living hard during her teenage years , dating , getting a driver 's license , and insisting she attend college across the country			0
after one particularly bad fight with her high - school boyfriend and too many drinks the summer before she was to leave , she fell through an open window 27 feet to the ground and ended up with almost every bone broken			0
' all of my friends went off to college , and i ’m finding out my high - school boyfriend is hooking up with chicks and joined a fraternity and is getting s — t - faced all the time , and i ’m fully casted , ' she recalls			0
if there was a silver - lining to the year - long rehab - and @entity14 is described as nothing if not positive - it was that she says she gained a better sense of comfort with being by herself			1
' i did n't know that i was as comfortable , before , ' she says , ' with loneliness			0
' when she did make it to college , she tried to keep her condition secret , sliding the hearing aids she now wearing beneath her pillow when she had a boy over or hiding them under her long brown hair			1
@entity14 says she infuriated by viral videos of cochlear implants she says mislead people about how they work ' i remember when i was a little girl and we went skiing and i saw someone wearing a ‘ blind skier ’ sign on their back , ' she says			1
' i felt almost humiliated for that person			0
it was such an exposure			0
now , if i went skiing , that would be me			0
' she says the first time she had to use a cane was exhausting just explaining her condition to friends who had never seen her use an aid before			0
' i ’d almost rather wear a f — king sign that says , ‘ i have a degenerative condition that ’s making me lose my hearing and my vision — that ’s why i ’m using a cane			1
’ but whatever , ' she says			0
now she using a mini goldendoodle to help make her way through the city and lives in a one - bedroom apartment on @entity1 's @entity172			0
she has a private practice as a psychotherapist and moonlights as a spin instructor , and has two master 's degrees from @entity177			1
the city has unique hazards for the blind			0
she 's been hit by cabs and had her feet run over and has fallen through one of the metal double doors that marks so many streets			0
she sometimes worries dates from j - date or @entity186 might @entity187 her and get scared off and was stood up just last week			0
' at this point , it 's a free - for - all , ' she says			0
@entity190 has a private practice as a psychotherapist and moonlights as a spin instructor , and has two master 's degrees from @entity177 she also says that the viral videos of children hearing for the first time with cochlear implants - which she has - are infuriating as they give people a false idea of the process			1
after agonizing over the decision she finally had an implant done in her right ear , but it delivers digitized voices that never sound right			0
' when i was first implanted , i felt like , ‘ what the f — k have i done ? ’ all the residual hearing in my right ear has gone , and now i have this weird , f — ked - up @entity214 voice in my head			1
and everyone says it ’s like a journey			0
' @entity219 would argue that it 's more ' a s — tload ' of hard work			0
speaking of , she 's in for a lot more of that next july when she crosses off one of her last goals before she loses the remainder of her sight			0
@entity229 next july , ' she says .			0
