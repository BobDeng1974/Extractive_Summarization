evidence of rivers , streams , and lakes suggests that @entity4 was , at some point , warm enough for liquid water to flow on its surface , according to a new study			1
but , rather than having permanent bodies of water , as seen on @entity12 , the surface of @entity4 likely went through episodic periods			1
the study suggests that periods of temperatures warm enough for water to flow may have only lasted for tens or hundreds of years at a time			1
these temperature changes may have also been related to brief periods of volcanic activity that spewed tons of greenhouse - inducing sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere the study was carried out by scientists from @entity33 and @entity35 's @entity34			1
these temperature changes may have also been related to brief periods of volcanic activity that spewed tons of greenhouse - inducing sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere			1
evidence of water on @entity4 dates back to the @entity42 mission , which arrived in 1971			2
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity51 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity4 by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys			2
@entity4 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june last year , @entity66 found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity4			1
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity66 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
the work combines the effect of volcanism with the latest climate models of early @entity4			0
with all that 's been learned about @entity4 in recent years , the mystery of the planet 's ancient water has deepened			1
the latest generation of climate models for early @entity4 suggests an atmosphere too thin to heat the planet enough for water to flow			1
the sun was also much dimmer billions of years ago than it is today , further complicating the issue			0
however , when volcanoes spewed out gas the atmosphere may have warmed enough for liquid water to form periodically on the surface			1
co-author dr @entity96 , professor of @entity12 , @entity97 and @entity98 at @entity33 , said : ' these new climate models that predict a cold and ice - covered world have been difficult to reconcile with the abundant evidence that water flowed across the surface to form streams and lakes			1
' this new analysis provides a mechanism for episodic periods of heating and melting of snow and ice that could have each lasted decades to centuries			0
' the work combines the effect of volcanism with the latest climate models of early @entity4 ( mosaic shown )			0
with all that 's been learned about @entity4 in recent years , the mystery of the planet 's ancient water has deepened			2
the researchers explored the idea that heating may have been linked to periodic volcanism in this image from @entity132 's @entity131 in september 2012 , a rock outcrop called link pops out from a @entity4 surface that is elsewhere blanketed by reddish - brown dust			0
the fractured @entity129 outcrop has blocks of exposed , clean surfaces that are consistent with deposits of water on @entity12 the researchers explored the idea that heating may have been linked to periodic volcanism			0
many of the geological features that suggest water flow date to around 3.7 billion years ago , a time when massive volcanoes are thought to have been active and huge lava outpourings occurred			1
however , on @entity12 widespread volcanism often leads to cooling rather than warming			0
sulphuric acid particles and thick ash reflect the sun 's rays , and that can lower temperatures			0
but the researchers thought the effects of sulphur on @entity4 's dusty atmosphere might have been different			2
to find out , they created a model of how sulphuric acid might react with the widespread dust in the @entity4 atmosphere			0
the work suggests that those sulphuric acid particles would have stuck onto dust particles , which would reduce their ability to reflect the sun 's rays			0
meanwhile sulphur dioxide gas would produce a modest greenhouse effect - just enough to warm the @entity4 equatorial region so that water could flow			2
dr @entity96 has been doing fieldwork for years in @entity175 and thinks the climate on early @entity4 may have been very similar to that of the cold , desert - like @entity178			2
professor @entity96 has been doing fieldwork for years in @entity175 and thinks the climate on early @entity4 may have been very similar to that of the cold , desert - like @entity178 ( pictured ) in @entity175 he said : ' the average yearly temperature in the @entity178 is way below freezing , but peak summer daytime temperatures can exceed the melting point of water , forming transient streams , which then refreeze			1
' in a similar manner , we find that volcanism can bring the temperature on early @entity4 above the melting point for decades to centuries , causing episodic periods of stream and lake formation			2
' but as that early active volcanism on @entity4 ceased , so did the possibility of warmer temperatures and flowing water			0
dr @entity96 said the research may offer new clues about where the fossilised remnants of life might be found on @entity4 , if it ever existed , and added : ' life in @entity175 , in the form of algal mats , is very resistant to extremely cold and dry conditions and simply waits for the episodic infusion of water to " bloom " and develop			1
' thus , the ancient and currently dry and barren river and lake floors on @entity4 may harbour the remnants of similar primitive life , if it ever occurred on @entity4			0

scientists from @entity33 and @entity35 's @entity34 have *claimed* water on @entity4 could only survive briefly
they claim it was only able to last for periods of tens or hundreds of years
this was *due* to the temperature on @entity4 , which made water flow episodic
@entity230 spewed sulphur into the atmosphere and changed the climate
when it warmed , it melted ices and snows , forming lakes and rivers
but the climate would soon cool again , turning the liquid into ice
this process may have occurred *repeatedly* in many episodes
evidence for water on @entity4 has been found in the form of dried up lakes , rivers and streams by the @entity66 rover
but this is the first study to suggest water was episodic , not permanent
