@entity1 's season has been plunged into deep uncertainty after @entity3 quit as @entity5 ’s assistant			1
@entity3 left the club with immediate effect on friday just five months after taking up the role as @entity5 ’s right - hand man , citing an inability to perform his duties alongside those of being @entity14 ’s no 2 with @entity15			1

@entity15 do not have another match until march			2
@entity3 had joined @entity5 as assistant manager at @entity1 in july , but quit after just six months @entity3 was still taking training on thursday ahead of the shock announcement on friday morning @entity33 - 2002 walks out of the @entity35 , telling boss @entity36 : ‘ i did n’t rate you as a player , i do n’t rate you as a manager , and i do n’t rate you as a person			1

but it is understood @entity3 had become increasingly disillusioned with working at @entity1 in recent weeks and continued for as long as he felt able			1

@entity14 admitted last night he had spoken to @entity3 about @entity1 at their recent international get - together , and that a desire for more time with his wife and children also played a part			1
‘ @entity3 being the perfectionist that he is , he wanted to give everything to every single cause			0
but i think family time , at the minute , that ’s something that was missing , ’ said the former @entity1 manager			0
@entity3 ’s departure at this stage in the season places huge strain on @entity5 , however			1
@entity1 have lost six of their last eight @entity24 games and only scored six times all season — leaving them two points above the relegation zone			1

’ with @entity126 likely to move clubs in january , @entity1 fans hope @entity3 is the only other figure to leave			1

@entity1 won three of their first four league games with @entity3 at the club , but have n't won any since @entity3 has been in his role with @entity15 for a year , and took the @entity1 job in july on top of that the striker has signed on loan for @entity142 and said : ‘ what people most respected about him was that he would tell you how it was			1
i ca n’t speak highly enough of him			0
’ in a statement , @entity3 said : ‘ ultimately , my roles with @entity1 and @entity33 and combining my commitment to these have become too much			2
