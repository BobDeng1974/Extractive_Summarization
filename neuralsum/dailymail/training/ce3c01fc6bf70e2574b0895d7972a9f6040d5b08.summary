security was dramatically stepped up for police officers and the @entity3 community in @entity4 yesterday amid fears of a terror attack			1
intelligence chiefs are worried that @entity9 fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in @entity11 last week that cost 17 lives			1
four jewish people and three police officers were among the dead			1
the plot held chilling echoes of the murder of fusilier @entity33 outside his barracks in @entity35			0
in other developments : @entity37 of @entity38 has reportedly been given enhanced security on a public appearance			0
@entity41 , the @entity4 ’s senior counter-terrorism officer , said : ‘ the global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the @entity3 community			1
’ the @entity49 assistant commissioner said the murders at a kosher supermarket in @entity52 , coupled with a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric from extremists , justified more patrols in areas with large @entity3 populations , including @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
some 263,000 people in @entity4 describe themselves as @entity3			1
the country ’s 70 jewish schools have been put on high alert			1
the @entity66 , which advises @entity3 institutions and groups on safety , said : ‘ we spend an inordinate amount of money on security , particularly on our schools – as we should			2
obviously there ’s a change in the threat level because there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen [ in @entity52 ]			1
’ @entity49 assistant commissioner @entity41 , pictured , confirmed that extra officers would be available to protect high - risk locations such as jewish schools as well as potential threats against police mr @entity41 added : ‘ we are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers , given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across @entity95 and the world			1
’ he said the authorities were also looking at the safety of other minority communities			0
speaking after talks with president @entity102 at the @entity103 , mr @entity100 said : ‘ it ’s very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in @entity95			1
‘ could that happen here ? what steps should be taken ? so the police have announced today that they ’ll be stepping up patrols , particularly to protect the @entity3 community			1
‘ we have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks , particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can			2
’ the prime minister used the talks to press for tougher action to require internet firms to join the fight against terror by alerting authorities to suspicious exchanges online			1
an official report last year concluded that @entity124 failed to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of @entity127 and the site was a ‘ safe haven for terrorists ’			0
investigators across @entity95 are working around the clock to target returning @entity27 fighters			1
the @entity4 security services believe around 600 @entity4 @entity135 have travelled to @entity136 and @entity137 to join the so - called jihad , with around half now back home			1
counter-terror chiefs fear they may carry out ‘ lone wolf ’ attacks			1
professor @entity144 , director - general of the @entity145 , a defence think - tank , said the chance of marauding attacks by armed gunmen was ‘ likely to increase ’			2
last year 3,934 potential extremists were referred to a @entity152 deradicalisation programme and 777 were assessed as such a danger that they needed to take part			1
we ca n't monitor all 300 fanatics say deluged security chiefs analysis by @entity158 @entity159 of the list of @entity162 countries whose citizens have travelled to fight in @entity136 and @entity137 stand @entity11 , @entity4 and @entity25			1
in the past week , two of those have witnessed terrifying scenes as jihadis swearing allegiance to @entity27 fought gun battles with the police			2
so is @entity4 next ? according to the security services , 600 extremists have travelled from the @entity4 to fight in @entity136			1
this compares with around 700 from @entity11 and 400 - plus from @entity25			0
@entity174 , pictured , inflicted huge damage on the capability of the security services to track fanatics of the 600 @entity4 , half are now back home			1
thirty have been arrested and charged			0
it is not practically possible for @entity181 to monitor the rest round - the - clock			0
more than 200 are known to be living in and around @entity59			0
a surveillance operation of this level requires 30 officers per suspect , plus manpower to monitor their electronic communications			0
such resources do not exist			0
@entity100 recently announced an extra £ 130million for the intelligence agencies , but it takes up to two years to train an @entity181 agent			1
case managers will have to make hugely difficult decisions over which to watch most closely			0
in the majority of cases , they will get the judgment right			0
at least four major plots have been foiled in the past year and since july 2005 there has been only one successful attack – the gruesome murder of fusilier @entity33			2
inevitably , @entity181 , like its counterparts in @entity11 and elsewhere , will sometimes call it wrong			0
fusilier @entity33 ’s killers had appeared repeatedly on the @entity181 radar but were n’t considered a priority			0
so had the 7/7 bombers			0
and @entity212 and @entity213 , both 22 and serving 12 years in jail for terror offences , were arrested on their return to the @entity4 from @entity136 only after @entity213 ’s mother had reported them to the police			1
terrorists are increasingly aware of how to avoid the attentions of the various international security services the threat from the jihadis takes two forms			0
some remain in contact with @entity27 and @entity230 leaders in @entity136 who are directing their attacks			2
these groups are believed to be planning ‘ spectacular ’ mass - casualty attacks , such as bringing down an airliner or a @entity236 - style bomb or gun attack			2
the second type of threat is far more crude and likely to be attempted by a lone individual or a pair who will have either returned from @entity136 or been inspired by jihadi propaganda			0
attack methods could include a hit - and - run , the beheading of a ‘ high - value ’ target or a mass - stabbing			2
the @entity33 - style scenario is the one that security officials consider most likely			0
already , one plot has been foiled and is before the courts			0
such attacks are fiendishly hard to detect			2
trying to buy explosives or an automatic rifle is likely to alert the security services			2
grabbing a kitchen knife from a drawer will not			0
in these instances , the best hope of foiling such a plot is if the protagonists talk about their intentions online			0
however , in the wake of the @entity174 revelations , fanatics increasingly know how to avoid giving their secrets away on the internet			2
indeed , it is hard to imagine a worse time for @entity174 – now hiding in @entity273 – to inflict such huge damage on the capabilities of the security services .			0
