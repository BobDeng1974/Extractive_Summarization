i 'm dreaming of a white christmas : a cold blast of @entity6 air sweeping across @entity8 's eastern states next week could bring the season 's first snowstorm plan : the schedule for next week 's potential storm would be tuesday over the @entity29 and eastern @entity30 , tuesday night and wednesday over the southern @entity31 and thursday along the @entity16 @entity32 reports forecasters are bracing for two other possible scenarios			1
one is that the low pressure system moves out to sea , bringing some rain and snow mix to the @entity31 with dry , cold conditions in @entity40			1
another possibility is that an unusually strong storm moves up the coast then backs into the @entity44 , leading to heavy snow inland and rain along the @entity48 corridor			0
' climatology does not favor major snow in along the @entity48 corridor in mid-november , ' @entity51 7 @entity50 's chief meteorologist @entity49 said , according to @entity32			0
' @entity55 is more likely in the higher ground north and west of the cities			0
' scenario 1 : forecasters say a coastal low which develops near the @entity15 and slides up the @entity16 could bring coastal rain , inland snow and gusty winds scenario 2 : another possibility is that the low does not make the turn up the coast and slides out to sea instead meteorologists warn a nor'easter snowstorm could mean regional power outages , blocked secondary roads , coastal flooding and beach erosion from @entity76 to @entity77 , @entity50 and @entity40			2
if it fails to unfold , residents from @entity79 to @entity80 can still expect cold conditions			0
