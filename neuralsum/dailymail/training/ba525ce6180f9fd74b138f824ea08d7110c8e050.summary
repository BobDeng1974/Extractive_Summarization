' absolutely no one is listening to your cry for assistance			2
it 's the ultimate in dehumanisation			2
' it has been a long journey for @entity7			0
fleeing the oppressive regime of @entity11 's @entity10 , and crossing the seas to @entity13 in a boat headed for @entity15 , the young man found himself living in the infamous @entity16			1
now an @entity20 citizen and a pioneering surgeon enabling soldiers to walk again , @entity18 's story is as extraordinary as it is harrowing			1
' there are always two sides to every story , ' dr @entity18 told @entity27			0
' i wanted to tell the story of living through the reign of @entity11 , and at the same time show the harshness inside detention centres in @entity13			0
' dr @entity33 fled @entity10 in 1999 after a squad of military police ordered his surgical team to mutilate the ears of amry deserters in 1999 , two years after qualifying as a surgical resident , dr @entity18 was wrapped up in a seemingly routine day working in a @entity41 hospital , when a squad of military police marched into the operating theatre and demanded that the surgical team amputate the ears of army and draft deserters , on orders from @entity11 himself			1
the head of surgery refused , and was dragged outside to be executed			2
' if anyone else shares his view , step forward			0
otherwise carry on , ' said one of the military ' thugs '			0
dr @entity18 saw his three options : carry out the operations , refuse to perform them and face the consequences , or hide			0
seeking refuge in a hidden toilet cubicle in the women 's locker room , all dr @entity18 knew was that he had to escape the barbaric regime of @entity11 which had ripped apart the country he had grown up in			0
dr @entity18 saw his three options : carry out the operations , refuse to perform them and face the consequences , or hide			0
aged 12 months , wearing a bangle he remembers attaching to his cat as an early memory of wanting to operate with his mother and cousins in @entity10 as a child , before the war broke out as a teenager on a high school trip to @entity81 , with a skate board and boom box dr @entity84 , third from left , having lunch with surgical training colleagues in @entity41 crossing the @entity89 border with $ 22,000 strapped to his stomach , he made a snap decision which would change his life permanently : he chose to board a boat carrying more than 150 passengers , heading towards @entity13 , away from one kind of danger and into the arms of another			1
stripped of his name , and instead identified by a number , dr @entity18 was detained in @entity16 in @entity13 for ten months			1
' like everyone else in @entity16 , i felt completely lost , isolated and helpless , ' he wrote			2
' as an absolute stranger in a foreign land , with no contacts and no one to care for you or offer support , that does n't give you a feeling of welcome or belonging			0
' in the sweltering heat of the @entity116 , the passionate advocate for education acted as an intermediary between other detainees and the guards , starting a shanty school for children in the detention centre to stave off boredom			0
describing the inadequate health care , food and living conditions , dr @entity124 said , ' we sensed the detention centre management was trying to deprive us of everything , including our names , in an effort to force us to go back to the countries we came from			0
' the chronic overcrowding , racial abuse , high levels of self - mutilation and suicide attempts , and long application processes were condemned in 2001 in an inquiry commissioned by the @entity142 federal government			2
@entity16 , where dr @entity143 was detained for 10 months in 1999 the refugees were forced to sleep on stretchers , keeping their belongings in plastic bags surprisingly , dr @entity124 is not against mandatory detention , but his descriptions of the lengths to which his fellow detainees went to protest their living conditions highlight his plea for more humane approaches to the issue of asylum seekers			1
' refugees should be investigated or detained , at least until they are cleared of diseases , and until the government is sure they are n't carrying fundamental views of potential terrorists , ' ' but this can be done in a much more humane and cost effective way			1
asylum seekers should not be detained indefinitely , and they should be given access to education , in order to learn @entity20 values			2
' ' i also believe that no child should be detained			2
i 've seen children spending 10 months in detention without learning one sentence			2
' after being charged with inciting a breakout of detainees at @entity16 , dr @entity124 was transferred to @entity178 , and describes the fleeting contact he had with his mother , calling her to let her know he was safe - although in a maximum security prison			1
after a lengthy trial , he was cleared of the charges , processed by the government and found himself a legal refugee			1
his immediate course of action was to find a job , and within two months of being released from the detention centre was working as a medical practitioner			1
' my motivation for writing the book was i felt that people deserved to see a different side of refugees			0
some people who come over can have a positive influence and input into society			0
' after undergoing a gruelling four - year orthopaedic training program , dr @entity124 excelled in the field of hip and knee replacement surgery , forming his own thoughts on the next stages of ' osseointegration ' , or the process of making bones ' whole ' again			1
during his time at @entity213 in @entity214 , he fulfilled his dream of becoming an orthopedic robotic limb surgeon , working with state - of - the - art technology to assist those who have lost limbs in combat			1
precisely a decade after dr @entity124 landed on @entity15 , one of his patients tragically lost both of his legs after stepping on an insurgent bomb in southern @entity226			1
@entity227 , a @entity228 rifleman , was only 20 years old and two months into his tour with @entity228 ’s 3 rifles in the @entity231 when his legs were blown off			1
@entity227 spent three years in rehab , spending 18 months learning how to walk with prosthetic legs , but was frustrated with his lack of mobility			1
performing the intricate two - part procedure on @entity228 rifleman @entity227 @entity227 taking his first steps on his new robotic legs at @entity239 in early 2014 at the @entity240 , awaiting the @entity242 exam results after a long battle , he managed to convince the @entity244 to sponsor an osseointegration procedure , after meeting a patient of dr @entity18 ’ at a clinic in @entity248 who had undergone the surgery			1
@entity227 flew to @entity13 to have titanium implants and adaptors fitted to the artificial bone that fits directly onto a robotic leg , all by an @entity10 refugee			1
the procedure is what has garnered the most attention for dr @entity18 , as the pioneering surgery sees bone and muscle grow around the titanium on the bone end , creating an essentially bionic leg			1
dr @entity18 was invited by the @entity265 to attend the ceremony in which @entity267 received his @entity269 medal , and was able to see for himself the benefits of osseointegration beyond the procedure			1
' what really strikes me as more influential was the moment when he walked back home four weeks after the surgery			2
he was filmed while walking up to house , and his wife was standing in the window			0
she said to her little son , " look , this is daddy , he ’s coming back home , " and the child said , " no this is not daddy			0
' it brought tears to my eyes , knowing that i made a difference			0
it 's that which keeps me going			0
' ' we are in process of receiving more soldiers from @entity228 , some who lost their legs in @entity226			1
as a person who comes from that same area i feel humbled and honoured to be allowed and chosen to help these people fighting for people from my region			0
' ' i believe that all humans have a duty in their life , our duty is to help others and make things better			0
' ' so i 'm not here , coming with a magic wand and having quick fix , but asylum seekers , and all people can be treated better			0
' walking @entity313 by @entity7 ( @entity314 ) is out next week			0
with his @entity316 - born wife @entity315 and their daughter @entity318 in 2011 ' i believe that all humans have a duty in their life , our duty is to help others and make things better			2
