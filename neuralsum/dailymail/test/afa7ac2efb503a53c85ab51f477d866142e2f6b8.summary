@entity0 spent a day this week donning his newly arrived @entity2 suit			1
‘ i wore it around the house a bit too much really but i was absolutely buzzing just to have it on			2
‘ trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started , ’ says @entity0 , one of the uncapped members of @entity9 ’s squad who fly to the @entity10 on thursday for a three - @entity12 series against @entity13			1
the 25 - year - old would be forgiven for checking the fit , because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st , he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler			1
@entity0 has been called up by @entity2 for the test series against @entity13 when he ’s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph @entity0 can find himself fielding for long stretches of time			1
thankfully the @entity29 paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope			2
‘ there are times when it gets boring in the field , so i bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team - mates , ’ @entity0 said recently			1
‘ i do n’t know how the @entity2 boys will take it , but i ’ll have a go			1
i like to have a trot and feed him apples — he loves @entity47			2
‘ sometimes it ’s just the pick - me - up the lads need			2
the horse will probably come with me to the @entity10 if he gets through immigration			1
if they do n’t like it then i can just tie him up and leave him somewhere			2
’ but @entity2 are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful @entity56 and @entity0 , whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run - up is reminiscent of @entity61 and @entity62 from previous eras , fits the bill			1
several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced			2
‘ i can hit 90mph but it ’s not something i tend to concentrate on , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the quickest ball i have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but i am sure i can bowl quicker than that			0
‘ you know yourself , without the speed guns , when it ’s coming out lovely and the rhythm ’s there			0
‘ when i bowl i am not just trying to blast people out , i would like to think that being the slight lad that i am with a short run - up , it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble			0
i tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think i have more skills than just raw pace			0
’ @entity89 among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing			0
it was no coincidence that his first three @entity94 appearances for @entity29 all came at @entity95 , where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. @entity29 paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler but he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball , swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season			1
previously , he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his @entity29 team - mates @entity114 and @entity115			0
so a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for @entity120 on the tour of @entity122			0
that breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it , with @entity0 ’s devotion to the @entity128 ’s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries , including stress fractures of the back , a cyst on his left ankle , knee trouble and side strains			1
‘ my body type has changed a lot since i was the lad who broke through into the first team , ’ he said			0
‘ i have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter			0
‘ i did a four - week camp in @entity149 , @entity122 , before @entity150 when i was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers			2
that got me the @entity120 call - up and off that , maintaining that strength , got me the test call - up			2
’ @entity0 has sought advice from former @entity29 and @entity2 fast bowler @entity157 his first - class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances , 23 , is a bit thin			1
but as he showed in taking four @entity164 wickets in as many overs in a @entity29 win at @entity167 three years ago , he has the knack of getting good players out			0
it may help him sneak ahead of @entity171 or @entity172 in the pace pecking order			0
‘ i am not going to the @entity13 to make the numbers up			1
i want to play a test match , whether it be the first , middle or last one , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a good opportunity			0
as an @entity2 fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the @entity10			1
’ it was for the carnage created at @entity184 , @entity185 , that @entity157 , another cricketing son of @entity186 , was renamed @entity187 11 years ago			0
‘ there ’s no pressure on us , is there ? ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the last lad from @entity186 took seven for 12			0
but if i get half of that i will be doing all right			0
@entity157 ’s a family friend so he ’s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how i should go about things			0
the main thing he told me is that the stumps do n’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in @entity207 ( the first delivery of the 2006 - 07 ashes , which went straight to @entity210 at second slip ) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you ’ll be fine after that			0
’ they are big shoes to fill but @entity0 appears comfortable in his own .			2

@entity0 part of the @entity2 squad flying to the @entity10
@entity9 *'s* side to play three test matches against @entity13
at 5ft 11in and 12st , he is not the size of traditional fast bowler
