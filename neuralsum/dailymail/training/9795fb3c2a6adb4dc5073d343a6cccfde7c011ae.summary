appearing in federal court in @entity33 , @entity2 read from the @entity11 in @entity34 for several minutes before @entity20 district judge @entity35 interrupted and asked him if he intended to say anything in @entity37			1
the defendant politely asked for more time to finish one verse , then shifted into a critique of @entity20 society and foreign policy			0
' what kind of system endorses torture ? ' he said , as some of his relatives wept in the gallery			0
' is this really the best system that humanity ever produced ? ' he closed by saying , ' i had nothing to do with any subway plot or bombing plot whatsoever			0
i ask @entity57 to release me from prison			0
' judge @entity35 told @entity2 that his remarks made him appear more like a robotic ' exhibit ' of extremism than the college - educated person who escaped war - torn @entity21 as a child and grew up in a stable immigrant family in a working - class section of @entity68			1
@entity70 's support : @entity2 's family , his parents and sister , are seen exiting federal court after his sentence hearing on friday ' you create the impression that you 're asking me to sentence you like the committed , anti-american jihadist you seem to want to be for the rest of your life , ' the judge said			1

' scores of innocent @entity9 would have been killed or maimed had @entity2 succeeded in his plot			1

life in @entity9 : the couple 's son was a college - educated young man who escaped war - torn @entity21 as a child and grew up in a stable immigrant family in a working - class section of @entity68 while receiving terror training at outposts in the @entity131 region of @entity116 , @entity30 operatives encouraged the @entity20 recruits to return home for a suicide - bombing mission intended to spread panic and cripple the economy			0
