the girl said @entity5 used the term waterboarding , and she was punished for spilling milk , shaking a ketchup bottle and vomiting into a cat 's litter box after being made to eat too much			1

his stepdaughter , then 11 , told the neighbor she refused to get out of the car when they returned home , so @entity5 forcibly brought her into the house by dragging her by her ankles across the gravel driveway and then spanked her			1
in an interview following the initial driveway incident , the girl told authorities about how her stepfather would waterboard her as punishment for bad behavior			1
he would hold her under faucets in the kitchen , bathroom and bathtub so that water would shoot up her nose , mimicking the sensation of drowning - a technique best - known for its use on suspected terrorists following the 9/11 attacks			0

the @entity161 administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of @entity166 2009 , president @entity159 banned its use , but the @entity168 has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops			0
on one occasion @entity5 even threatened he ' was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so that she could not move '			2
another time he allegedly told her she ' could go five minutes without brain damage '			0
the girl added that @entity5 would ' sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he would lose track of time and she would die '			1
after the alleged torture , she would ' go outside and cry ' , but @entity5 would come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand , according to court documents			2
' he would tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape , ' police noted			0
' he would not let go until she lost feeling and collapsed to the ground			0
' the girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened			0
her then 5 - year - old sister was also interviewed and said that , although she witnessed the abuse to her sister , she was never targeted ' because she is too young for it '			1

" ' i was scared he was going to hurt me ...			0
i thought he meant , like , more pain , ' she said			0
prosecutors have introduced photographs of scratches and bruises on the girl , but she said monday that several of them came from a bicycle as she pushed it along the road when she ran away from home			0
jurors were shown four homemade videos documenting @entity5 's encounters with the girl about her behavior			1
in the first video , @entity5 repeatedly asked why she does n't try to ' fix the damage ' after she misbehaves			2
' why do n't you try to repair things when you do something wrong , sweetheart ? ' he calmly asked the girl			0
taking work home : at the time of his arrest , police investigated the idea that @entity5 performed the waterboarding as part of his research in another video , @entity5 asked the girl why she could n't recognize that it was ' a major crime ' to break the rules of the house			2
