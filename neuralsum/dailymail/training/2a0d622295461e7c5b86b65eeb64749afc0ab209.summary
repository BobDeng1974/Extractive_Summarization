' we should n't have the state using its power to dictate what people choose to wear in their private lives , but when there are important points of intersection with the state in obtaining state services i think it 's entirely reasonable for people to show who they are , ' mr @entity11 said			2
there are no laws banning veils or headscarves in the @entity118 , though there have been unsuccessful attempts in some states to ban @entity123 law			1
