now , debt organisations have warned that parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money towards household bills amid fears the @entity27 ‘ stiff upper lip ’ makes them reluctant to admit when they need help			1

on top of this , 80 per cent still buy their adult child ’s groceries , and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night , according to the study by website @entity47			1
parents expressed concern that their children could not afford to move out or were struggling to save for a house deposit			2
but the survey found the average salary of a grown - up child living at home is £ 26,000 , giving them a comfortable £ 1,000 in disposable income each month			2
