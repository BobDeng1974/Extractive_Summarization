parents : @entity1 and @entity2 were hurt by a controversial book about @entity4 , a judge ruled the former police chief who published astonishing claims that @entity1 and @entity2 faked their daughter @entity4 ’s disappearance to cover up her death expects them to lose their libel battle against him , it was claimed today			1
@entity13 is reported to have said the early rulings by the judge in the case suggested her verdict may be ' favourable ' to him			2
the 57 - year - old told @entity19 television on friday that @entity21 ’s indications so far led him to believe he would win the case , according to the @entity22			0
his comments came as a ruling emerged that the @entity25 were hurt by the book written by mr @entity13 , who was tasked with finding the girl			1
but the pain the couple feel existed before mr @entity13 published the controversial claims , mrs @entity21 said			1
the finding came out of a key hearing on wednesday in @entity33 ahead of a final judgement in the long - running £ 1million libel trial which has pitted the @entity25 against the disgraced former detective they accuse of hampering the search for their daughter			1
the judge presiding over the high - profile case ruled on 37 points she found had been proven and not proven since lawyers started their court battle in october 2013			0
she said statements made by mr @entity13 in his july 2008 book @entity47 of the lie and a subsequent tv documentary and @entity19 newspaper interview had left the @entity25 suffering ‘ rage , desperation , anguish , worry , insomnia and lack of appetite ’			1
but she ruled that although the book had affected the couple , those feelings pre-existed the book ’s publication three days after the first @entity19 investigation into @entity4 ’s disappearance was shelved and the @entity25 were told they were no longer ‘ arguidos ’ ( formal suspects )			1
she also decided it had been proven the couple felt badly about being considered responsible for hiding their daughter ’s body - a thesis which @entity19 police behind a new probe into @entity4 ’s disappearance have publicly rubbished - but described those feelings as ‘ expectable			0
’ but she dismissed the idea mr @entity13 ’s claims about the @entity25 had stopped the @entity19 police investigating @entity4 ’s disappearance			1
still missing : @entity19 prosecutors reopened their probe into @entity4 ’s disappearance last year the rulings left mr @entity13 confident of court victory next month when the judge is expected to announce her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing			1
he accused the @entity25 of taking him to court so they could exonerate themselves of blame for the disappearance of their daughter , who vanished aged three from their @entity113 holiday flat in may 2007 while they were eating tapas nearby with friends			2
@entity19 papers signalled the outcome of last wednesday ’s hearing as a positive one for heart specialist @entity2 and @entity1 moments after it finished			1
but as the full findings became apparent they changed their tune to portray the judge ’s rulings as a slap in the face for the couple			0
leading @entity19 daily @entity132 headlined an article on the result of the hearing : ‘ @entity25 destroyed before the book			2
’ rival @entity137 reported : ‘ judge without proof that the book about @entity141 " destroyed " her parents			0
’ the @entity25 told the @entity33 court staging the @entity146 libel trial last summer they were left ‘ devastated and crushed ’ by his book , which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the @entity151 couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief			1
mrs @entity154 , 47 , said @entity4 ’s twin siblings @entity155 and @entity156 , now ten , knew mr @entity13 had written a book but did n’t know the detail			2
legal case : the rulings left mr @entity13 ( pictured ) confident of court victory next month when as expected the judge announces her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing she told the court last july after applying to make a statement : ‘ i believe that ’s what 's in mr @entity13 ’s book and the documentary is very distressing to adults			1
to a child it could be very damaging			0
’ asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book , she said : ‘ i was devastated			2
it made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice i felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole			0
‘ it was very painful to read and i felt sad for @entity4			0
i also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage i felt it was doing in @entity19			0
’ she went on to accuse mr @entity13 , thrown off the @entity185 investigation in 2007 for criticising @entity151 police , of ‘ consistently smearing ’ she and @entity2 - and claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter ’s whereabouts			1
it has already been revealed mr @entity13 , 56 , earned at least £ 344,000 from his book and tv documentary			2
the ex-police chief , who is being sued for £ 1million , is denying defamation			2
case : mr and mrs @entity154 arrive for the libel case against mr @entity13 at @entity33 's @entity201 last june his lawyer @entity202 claimed in the last open court hearing in december the @entity25 had taken legal action against his client ‘ to rid themselves of guilt for their negligent conduct ’ in leaving @entity4 and her siblings alone			1
he also claimed their lack of cooperation with the @entity19 police authorities had led to the archiving of the investigation in 2008			0
@entity19 prosecutors reopened their probe into @entity4 ’s disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by @entity220			0
no date has been set yet for the final judgement in the libel case			0
the judgement will be read out in court before being released in writing on the same day			0
a source close to the @entity25 said last night : ‘ we expect it to be ready for next month			0
