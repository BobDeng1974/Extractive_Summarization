one determined woman lost 50lbs in seven months so that she could attend her 50th high school reunion wearing the 50 - year - old dress she adored as a student			1
@entity4 , a 68 - year - old photographer based in @entity5 , @entity6 , who stands at 5ft 1in and weighed 175lbs at her heaviest in february , was desperate to show up to her september reunion as svelte as she was when she was 18			1
she created her own plan of attack , which she dubbed the ' @entity12 ' lifestyle , according to @entity13 , and consists of simply ' walking , water and watching what i put in my mouth			2
' i had wonderful , pretty dresses and slim pants that were put away ... as i continued to gain weight and hated myself for it , ' she told the publication			2
but something about the upcoming reunion forced her to drag those clothes out of her closet and re-assess her health , her weight , and her wardrobe			2
emboldened to reach her goal and lose 50lbs , she prophesied : ' i will not need to buy a thing			2
i will just go upstairs and pull out lots of attractive outfits that i have longed to wear for years			0
' the three w 's : ms @entity4 , pictured ( left ) before the weight loss and ( right ) after , obeyed what she calls the ' @entity12 ' lifestyle , which consists of ' walking , water and watching what i put in my mouth ' her path to success was not easy , especially at the beginning			1
ms @entity4 , who travels a lot for work , was formally accustomed to gas station snacks and had no problem throwing back ' five @entity60 donuts in one sitting			1
' ' two candy bars and i am in another zone ! ' she recalls of her sugar - guzzling days			2
' it is like i have taken a drug			0
i am tired , i think negative thoughts and i hate myself for eating bad things			0
' as her youthful metabolism inevitably slowed over the years , ms @entity4 , who is married , gradually piled on the pounds			1
her health had nosedived and so had her mood			0
for years , she avoided tucking her shirt in so as to mask the weight gain , and eventually settled into an existence of stretchy polyester pants			0
but once she had made her choice to fit into that dress again , nothing could sway her from her path			1
roomy : ms @entity4 ( pictured now ) travels a lot for work and was formally accustomed to gas station snacks and throwing back ' five @entity60 donuts in one sitting ' ms @entity4 educated herself on healthy eating and vowed never to consume anything that was n't good for her body from then on			1
for breakfast , according to her research , this meant fruit , poached eggs and ham , with coffee and milk			0
she made a point never to eat lunch out of habit , only when she was truly hungry ; after which she would munch on sugar - free low - fat yogurt , fruit and nuts , or a fresh salad			0
dinner was grilled fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables			0
during the time , ms @entity4 was travelling extensively around @entity112 on a work project , so avoiding the rows of sugary treats at every pit stop was tough			1
to stave off cravings , she carried with her a selection of unsalted nuts , and as an absolute last resort , a can of baked beans			0
high school days : ms @entity4 , pictured when she 18 years old result ! on september 17 , ms @entity4 attended her @entity125 reunion in @entity126 wearing the dress she had worn when she was 18 ( second row , far right ) she still stopped off at @entity130 chains along the road , but eschewed the fried , fatty foods and gravies for fresh grilled catfish with a baked sweet potato			1
drinking enough water - 5 to 6 bottles per day , cold , to burn more calories - was key too , as was a good deal of walking ; 10,000 steps and 10 flights of steps a day			1
even when ms @entity4 was staying in motels and had little time for exercise , she would trudge the halls and stomp up and down the staircases in order to reach her daily goal			2
ms @entity4 credits her @entity151 , a wearable device that tracks activity level , and @entity154 , an app which logs calorie intake , for keeping her on the straight and narrow			2
time flies : ms @entity4 , pictured now ( left ) and early on in her weight loss journey ( right ) when she tucked her shirt into her pants for the first time in years ' every day , no matter what is on my plate - figuratively rather than calorically speaking - i have walked my steps , drunk my water , and not touched sweets			1
not one , ' she said a few months into her new @entity12 regime			0
the hard work paid off			0
on september 17 , ms @entity4 attended her @entity125 reunion in @entity126 wearing the dress she had worn when she was 18			1
and her mission has not yet drawn to a close			0
ms @entity4 plans to lose 20 more pounds by her birthday - another major milestone - in may 2015			1
' i trust this story will be an inspiration to others who are determined to lose weight – no matter what their age , ' she concludes			0
' yes it ’s hard , i ’d say to them – no getting around it – but so very worth it			0

@entity4 , once 175lbs , lost 50lbs in seven months so she could fit into her 50 - year - old dress
