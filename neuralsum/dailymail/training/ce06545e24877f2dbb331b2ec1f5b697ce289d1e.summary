speaking at the @entity46 party conference in @entity47 , mr @entity2 said : ' while we gather here today the leaders of the militant teaching unions have called a strike			1
' and the reason they have gone out on strike - in a new example of the twisted militant logic - is they want to stop good teachers being paid more money			1
' he said he recently challenged a union leader over the strike plans , and was told he should not worry because they were planning ' child - friendly industrial action '			1
but mr @entity2 hit back : ' there is nothing child - friendly about industrial action			2
' children lose a day of learning while parents are forced to pay for expensive childcare , he said			2
' i have a simple message for the leaders of miltant teaching unions : please , please , please do n't put your ideology before our children 's interests			0
' dismay : the vice-president on the @entity20 , @entity83 , said teachers were angry about numerous aspects of the government 's education policy @entity83 , vice-president of the nut , @entity83 , said teachers were angry about numerous aspects of the government 's education policy			0
acknowledging that many of those at the rally were angry at what they feel is mr @entity2 's personal ‘ disregard ’ for their profession , ms @entity90 said : ‘ this strike is about our concerns about what mr @entity2 is doing to education , about teachers ' working conditions , about his mission to deregulate pay , and also to restore our pensions			1

‘ we have taken a very , very difficult step to come out on strike because mr @entity2 is not listening to us			1
’ teachers had exhausted every other avenue prior to taking strike action , ms @entity90 claimed , adding : ‘ i know it 's very , very disruptive for parents but we want parents to get angry with the man who 's causing this - and that 's mr @entity2			2
‘ it 's very difficult to take action when it affects people that you are close to			0
‘ in general the public have a high regard for teachers and if we explain why we are taking this action then i 'm sure they will understand and they will join us in saying ' enough is enough - we want a better future for our children '			0
‘ we want teachers to have fair pay for what they do , and a good education system for all our children , not just some of our children			0
’ widespread action : members of @entity20 and @entity21 march through @entity39 as well as pay and pension reforms , many teachers voiced concerns at the decision to permit schools to employ non-qualified teaching staff and introduce performance - related pay			1
@entity20 member @entity145 , who teaches at @entity35 's @entity146 , said : ‘ the teaching profession is being massively attacked and undermined by an education secretary who does n't listen to the profession , a man who has a very blinkered vision based on his own education			1
‘ he is trying to impose his vision on children without consultation and without listening to genuine concerns			0
’ the industrial action was condemned by the government , which defended its plans to reform pay structures			0
a @entity162 spokeswoman said : ‘ it is disappointing that the @entity20 and @entity21 are striking over the government 's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more			0
’ a recent poll found that 61 % of those questioned backed linking teachers ' pay to performance - a key @entity165 reform currently being introduced - she insisted , adding that the survey also found that majority of respondents were opposed to the walkouts or thought teachers should not be allowed to strike			2
