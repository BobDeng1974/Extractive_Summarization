by @entity1 reporter published : 09:46 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 14:53 est , 19 august 2013 ' he hogs it ' : library director @entity4 wants to end 9 - year - old @entity6 's five year reign over her library 's children 's reading contest a fifth grade boy just won his public library ’s children ’s reading club contest for the fifth year in a row but instead of congratulating him , his librarian wants him banned from the contest			1
@entity17 director @entity4 says 9 - year - old reading ace @entity6 ‘ hogs ’ the annual competition and needs to step aside			1
the self - proclaimed ‘ king of the reading club ’ read 63 books for this summer ’s @entity23 event between june 24 and august 3 and his unparalleled prowess has the other children scrambling to keep the pace			1
‘ other kids quit because they ca n’t keep up , ’ @entity4 told the @entity30			0
over the last five years of contests , @entity6 has devoured an impressive 373 books at or above his reading level			2
he accepted his fifth title on august 15			0
@entity6 has won the coveted prize every year since kindergarten			0
he ’s proud of his accomplishments and he ’s not shy about saying it			0
‘ it feels great , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ i think that was actually a record - breaking streak			0
’ @entity6 ’s mom @entity43 concurs			1
‘ i do n’t see the downside of @entity6 winning five years in a row			2
i think people should be proud of him , especially a library director , ’ she said			2
prizes he ’s received over the years include an atlas , water bottle , and t - shirt			0
‘ they ’re really not any grand things			0
i think he just likes to be the top reader , ’ said @entity43			0
menace ? 9 - year old @entity6 is about to start fifth grade and has won his library 's reading contest since kindergarten			1
but his library 's director thinks it is time for him to relinquish his crown feud : the picturesque @entity66 may be pretty on the outside , but strife in the children 's section is making things ugly on the inside but @entity4 does n’t seem to like it			1
until @entity43 made the controversy public , @entity4 wanted to change the rules so that winners are drawn from a hat instead of chosen by number of books read			2
and this is n’t the first time the library director and @entity43 have been embroiled in a reading contest dispute			1
@entity4 told the @entity30 that @entity6 ’s mother has a bad ‘ attitude ’ toward the reading contest because several years ago a little girl claimed to have read 200 books			1
though the mother backed up her daughter ’s claims , it turned out they were both lying			0
‘ that ’s when we stopped [ going on the parents ’ word ] because she was n’t [ reading the books ] , ’ @entity4 said			0
rigged ? @entity99 , right , says her son deserves to keep competing			0
but @entity4 says @entity6 's mom has an ' attitude ' about the contest because of cheating by other kids in previous years now the participants are quizzed on each book they claim to have read to ensure they ’re telling the truth			1
the debate over @entity6 ’s reading award has caused internal strife at the library , as well			2
library aide @entity113 , who @entity6 calls ‘ @entity114 , ’ has taken @entity6 ’s side over her boss ’s and says @entity6 won the contest fair and square			1
‘ my feeling is you work , you get it			0
that ’s just the way it is in anything , ’ said @entity113 , who ’s worked at the library for 28 years			0
dynasty : though @entity43 has threatened to take her son 's talents elsewhere , @entity6 's brother @entity127 , right , may continue the family 's reign -- he 's won second place for the last two years it remained unclear how the feud would be resolved			1
but @entity43 maintains she ’ll be taking her son ’s reading skills elsewhere — to the @entity137 in @entity138			2
meanwhile , taking @entity6 out of the running wo n’t necessarily end @entity4 ’s troubles			1
there may be a dynasty emerging in @entity6 ’s 7 - year - old brother @entity127 , who has now won second place for two years in a row .			1

@entity6 has won the @entity17 reading club contest five years in a row
