the first crop circle of the year has appeared in a field near @entity2 in @entity3 leaving locals stumped over who or what created it			1
covering an enormous stretch of wheat field , the 400ft pattern , which is made up of geometric lines and circles , emerged overnight			1
while many believe crop circles are created by local pranksters , some think the mysterious shapes are evidence of aliens , including amateur pilot and crop circle enthusiast @entity22 , 43 , who said : ‘ whoever , or whatever , created the shape must have been there all night - you have to really admire their handiwork			1
wheat is the easiest crop to work with illegal : farmers are n't a fan of crop circles because they destroy the crops			1
@entity22 was fined £ 100 by magistrates in 2000 after admitting causing damage some farmers mow the incredible formations out of their field as soon as they appear to deter recurrences mr @entity22 , from @entity59 , @entity60 , added : ‘ last summer we did n't get many circles , but this beauty certainly makes up for that			2
‘ the first circle of the season really does mark the start of great @entity68 summer			2
‘ i know farmers hate them , but you really do have to appreciate the amount of effort that went in to making a 400ft pattern in a field of crops			2
’ there is increasing rivalry between the circle makers to produce ever more complex , intricate patterns			0
however mr @entity22 is not a believer of the paranormal and has previously admitted to creating crop circles himself			1
he is the only man in @entity68 convicted of making crop circles after admitting damaging a farmer ’s crop in 2000 near @entity88 , @entity60			1
mr @entity22 , who was fined £ 100 by magistrates , was prosecuted after one of his crop circles was published on the internet			2
he has since given up his hobby because he suffers from hayfever			0
a crackdown by farmers meant that only 15 crop circles appeared in @entity60 last year , compared to 50 in 2012			1
insiders claim farmers are fed up with crop circles and tourists looking to have an ' out of body experience ' inside them			1
this crop circle , which appeared in a field in @entity106 near @entity60 in june 2004 , was also created in a wheat field a bee crop circle similarly appeared in wheat fields in @entity110 , near @entity106 in @entity60 in june 2004 some have taken the drastic step of mowing the formations out of their fields as soon as they appear			2
according to @entity115 , who has also admitted to creating the designs , july is the best month for crop circles			2
he told the @entity118 : ‘ the season runs from april , when the first crop is oil seed rape			0
in june it 's barley and by mid-july it 's wheat			0
that 's the best crop to work in , that 's when the most spectacular circles appear			0
because each stem is upright , you can get pin sharp clarity			0
’ like farmers , not everyone appreciates the efforts that mr @entity115 goes to			0
he reported abuse from people who believe crop circles are in fact the work of aliens			1
mr @entity115 , who is part of a group called @entity142 , said : ‘ my art collective - myself , @entity144 and @entity145 - get thousands of abusive e-mails and phone calls			0
we 've had attacks on our property , and one of my team had bricks thrown at him			0
but at least this is not @entity155 - people do n't carry guns here			0
‘ i do n't regard myself as a hoaxer - i 'm not interested in rug - pulling anybody			0
yet the assumption is that if i make a crop circle , it must be because i want to undermine the beliefs of people who think they are not man - made			1

intricate design is the first one of the year and has emerged in a field near @entity2 in @entity3
the number of crop circles appearing in @entity68 is *declining* : 2012 produced 50 while 2013 produced just 15
some believe this is because of a recent crackdown by farmers as trespass and *destruction* of crops is illegal
*sceptics* believe crop circles are entirely man - made , while others believe they are the creation of aliens
