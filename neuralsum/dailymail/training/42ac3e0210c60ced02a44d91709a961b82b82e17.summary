i 'm going to say some things i know to be true			1

‘ it might be really sordid and bad sexual etiquette , but whatever else it is , it is not rape or you bankrupt the term rape of all meaning			0

' these attacks have been used by @entity167 before and they may still be doing this now ready to launch another attack			0
' it is one of the easiest ones they can do , which is why they do it			0
' most sites were not vulnerable to the attacks and seemed to be working normally this morning , but the @entity169 admitted it had been affected by the hacktivists ' assaults			0

he added : ' while the @entity8 has n't retracted nor apologised , the danger still exists			0
' remember that @entity233 beat @entity234			0
and with many @entity236 it 's easier to bring down a number of @entity234			1
' so we 're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all @entity242 law , all international law , the @entity244 and all diplomatic traditions of the last , at least , 300 years on a global scale			1
