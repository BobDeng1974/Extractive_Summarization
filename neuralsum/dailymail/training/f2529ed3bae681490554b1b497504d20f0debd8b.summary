by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 05:03 est , 2 may 2013 the weekly supermarket shop can be a perplexing chore – so much so , say experts , that we are missing out on bargains			1
shoppers pushing trolleys through the aisles are confronted with so many competing posters and signs that they can not take them all in , according to behaviour analysts			0
as a result , the subconscious takes over and we tend to fill our trolleys with items regardless of whether or not they are good value			1
bombarded by offers : all the half price signs in a @entity22 supermarket			1
but research has revealed our brain can not take in all the offers a study cites the example of dvds priced at £ 4.24 each that suddenly saw an increase in sales when a sign appeared promoting them at ‘ two for £ 10 ’			1
similarly , sales of a big brand lager placed under a prominent sign soared by 10 per cent compared with rival brands on the same aisle			1
the brain of the shoppers apparently registered the sign as evidence that the lager was on special offer when , in fact , it simply read : ‘ thieves will be prosecuted			2
’ and while supermarkets routinely use so - called @entity50 deals – buy one , get one free – to tempt customers , researchers say it appears that many people are immune to them			1
despite a @entity50 deal on teabags , nearly half of shoppers simply bought just one box , rather than picking up the second free one			1
@entity59 on baked beans and cheese got a similar reaction			0
@entity63 , managing director of behaviour analysts @entity65 , said the research suggests people are influenced by the fact that a product is being promoted , but are less likely to take in the detail			1
( source : @entity65 ) @entity65 sends teams of researchers into stores to monitor real life evidence of how people shop			2
mr @entity63 said : ‘ our brains just can not cope with the number of decisions we have to make in a store			0
we will see a different offer every three - quarters of a second in a supermarket and we just ca n’t cope			2
‘ if you are faced with 85 different types of lager in an aisle , the brain just automatically tries to slim that down to a smaller number			0
‘ if there are four or five on special offer , the brain will use that as a reference for a bargain			0
it is not something you consciously notice			0
’ ‘ in a number of studies we have carried out , it is clear that the precise nature of a special offer or deal was much less important than the presentation of the promotion			2
‘ shoppers are unable to make detailed calculations in - store and so they take shortcuts or start to guess			0
what they actually do is reduce their choice to anything that stands out above the rest			0
’ mr @entity63 said : ‘ the message to shoppers is to take more time taking in the detail of a promotion in order to understand what the saving is – if any			0
‘ the message to supermarkets is that it does n’t really matter what the offer is as long as the product is visually prominent			0
’ promotions : offers in @entity22 and co-op stores but research has shown we can not tell if we are getting value ' great offers ' : our sub-conscious is drawn to bright displays like this one in @entity132 's , research has found			1

@entity135 takes over because there are so many offers
sales of dvds priced at £ 4.24 *rocketed* when a sign said ' two for £ 10 '
when shop launched @entity50 teabag box deal , *45* *%* picked up just one box
we are influenced by product promotions - but do *n't* take in the details
