by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 12:15 est , 16 november 2012 it is usually patients who are afraid of dentists , but when a 75 stone polar bear needed root canal treatment yesterday , the dynamics of that relationship could easily have changed around			1
arktos the polar bear had been suffering from toothache so vets from the @entity11 had to check over his 42 razor sharp teeth			2
early yesterday morning @entity14 was darted with tranquilisers and the three hour dental operation began			1
polar bear @entity17 during his three hour dental treatment and @entity20 , in @entity21 , @entity22 keepers had noticed that the usually playful polar bear seemed to be feeling sorry for himself and not hanging out with fellow bear @entity26 quite so much			2
broken or infected teeth are a major cause of large carnivore debilitation and death in the wild			0
@entity26 and @entity14 , the only polar bears on display in the @entity35 , had been trained to open their huge powerful mouths to show their keepers their terrifying teeth			1
jaw - some : huge polar bear @entity14 is given oxygen during the delicate dental operation to save his teeth a small area of discolouration was spotted on @entity45 ’ upper left canine tooth and the @entity20 called in external dental experts to fix the problem			1
when experts got four - year - old @entity14 into the equivalent of a dentist ’s chair - a specially reinforced table made from scaffolding poles and planks - they discovered he needed a root canal			1
team effort : @entity14 is rolled into position on the ' dentists chair ' by experts including two dentists , two radiographers , two veterinarians , one vet nurse and three senior animal staff one of his teeth had become damaged at the tip and rotted through , so it needed drilling out , cleaning and then packing with dental cement			1
exactly the same procedure as in humans , just with a tooth canal almost six times the size			0
polar molars : a team of vets from the @entity11 operate on @entity45 @entity77 , @entity78 at the @entity20 , said : ' because we regularly train our polar bears and other large animals to take part in regular health checks , this means that we can spot issues like this before they become a problem and give our animals the best possible care available			2
an x-ray of the four - year - old polar bear 's tooth shows dentists the extent of the damage ' @entity14 really is a lucky bear and we were delighted to be able to save his tooth ; in the wild the infection would have tracked through his system , causing him a great deal of pain and discomfort and , over the longer term , it could eventually kill him			1
' although due to his size an operation like this is never straight forward , the dental work carried out is actually very similar to a root canal that we humans would have - although obviously on a much larger scale			1
heavily - sedated @entity45 is left to recover from the root canal treatment as experts check on him ' @entity14 needed a specially made and reinforced operating table and a team of 12 to carry out the procedure			1
' as far as we can tell , the operation was a success			0
it took three hours in total and @entity14 just took 20 minutes to come round			0
he was then up on his feet , although still a bit wobbly			0
' he quickly had a drink and we expect him to start eating again this morning , when we will try him on some of his favourite soft foods as his mouth will still be a bit sore			0
experts check @entity14 is getting a good supply of oxygen during the precarious dental treatment @entity14 spent the night in a small holding area and then should be reunited with @entity26 later today			2
' the operation lasted three hours and involved a team of ten experts : two dentists , two radiographers , two veterinarians , one vet nurse and three senior animal staff			2
@entity14 arrived at the @entity20 in early april 2012 from @entity141			0
he was born in @entity142 in 2007			0
a bear with a sore tooth : a groggy @entity45 comes round after his root canal operation after the operation it ’s hoped he will soon be able to enjoy food again for his fifth birthday on november 30			1
earlier last year the @entity20 ’s other polar bear , @entity26 , also underwent a dental procedure			0
in this case a tooth extraction , @entity26 had a canine tooth that had not developed properly , likely due to an injury when he was a cub , which had become infected .			0
