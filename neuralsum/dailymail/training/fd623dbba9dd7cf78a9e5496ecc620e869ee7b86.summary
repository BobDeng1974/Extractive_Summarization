by @entity0 published : 02:56 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 26 june 2012 tradition : the sound of the @entity3 is said to give the area within which true cockneys are born tradition dictates that only those born within earshot of the ' @entity3 ' can claim to be @entity5			2
but it seems that the ranks of these ' true ' @entity10 are dwindling - because noise pollution is drowning out the sound of the bells of @entity3			1
as the street noise in the capital increases every year , the area in which the peeling of the bells can be heard has been gradually reduced			1
the phenomenon is considered so serious by church officials that they have backed plans to give the @entity3 an audio boost with an @entity24 recording of their sound			2
around 150 years ago they could be heard across the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and even parts of @entity34 and @entity35			1
they now can only be heard in a small area in the @entity38 and @entity39			2
and the study into the bells ' sound revealed there are no maternity wards within earshot of @entity3			2
but now internet users can listen to the bells in the online download - as researchers aim for their sound to be heard more widely			0
a study undertaken to coincide with the new @entity50 of @entity51 found that in 1851 , noise levels in the capital were similar to that of @entity56 's countryside today			1
shrinking influence : a diagram shows , in green , the area where the sound of the @entity3 reached in 1851 , and in blue , the much smaller area that it reaches now would you @entity62 it ? true cockneys like the @entity65 could have their days numbered due the lessened influence of the @entity3 and the rise of other dialects while sound levels were around 20 to 25 @entity71 in the evening , ambient levels now measure around 55 @entity71			1
researchers said it was due to a combination of road and aircraft noise pollution			1
describing the @entity24 soundtrack which it is hoped will keep the @entity5 tradition alive , reverend @entity77 of @entity3 said : ' there are hundreds of thousands of people of @entity5 descent across the world , from @entity85 to @entity86 , the @entity87 to @entity88 , and i hope that they will enjoy hearing the chimes that were so very familiar to their ancestors			0
' perhaps this digital initiative will help create a new generation of global @entity5 , and , if so , i hope that in the years to come they will have the opportunity to visit @entity51 and hear the remarkable sound of @entity3 in person			1
' in the 14th century the term @entity5 was used by rural people to native @entity10 who relied on their wits rather than their strength			0
by the 16th century it suggested a lack of masculinity			0
in time the term became synonymous with working class @entity10 and it lost its negative connotations , but is occasionjally still used disparagingly by those in the @entity111 to describe all @entity10			0
the reference to the @entity3 appeared around 1600 in @entity114 's ' an itinerary ' that said : ' @entity10 , and all within the sound of @entity3 , are in reproach called @entity5			0
' @entity119 @entity118 was the first to define it in this sense			0
in his @entity122 in @entity123 ( 1617 ) he wrote : ' a cockney or @entity125 , applied only to one born within the sound of @entity3 , that is in the @entity28			1
' famous names born within the sound of the @entity3 eric ' the @entity128 ( @entity30 ) @entity129 ( born in @entity130 ) @entity131 ( @entity132 ) @entity133 ( @entity134 ) @entity135 ) @entity136 and @entity137 ( @entity138 ) @entity139 ( @entity3 ) @entity140 ( @entity3 ) @entity141 ( @entity142 ) @entity143 ( @entity30 ) @entity144 ( @entity145 ) @entity146 ( @entity30 ) @entity147 ( @entity39 ) @entity148 ( @entity30 )			0

street noise now ' twice as loud in @entity51 ' as 150 years ago
cockney influence also dying out because of other dialects
