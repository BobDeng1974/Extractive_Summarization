@entity0 hit the post with an effort from around 50 yards out during @entity4 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity5 on saturday evening but the question is : did he mean it ? with the @entity10 giants trailing 1 - 0 at @entity11 , the @entity8 produced what looked like an audacious repeat of @entity15 's famous lob for @entity16 against @entity17 back in 1996			1
the ball flew through the air and caught @entity5 goalkeeper @entity20 completely off guard before dipping and smacking the post ; much to the disappointment of @entity24 who raised his arms to celebrate before being beaten to the rebound by a defender			0
@entity0 hits the ball goalwards from around 50 yards out during @entity4 's defeat to @entity5 @entity0 's strike hits the post after catching @entity5 goalkeeper @entity20 completely off guard @entity24 ( right ) puts his arms in the air to celebrate having thought @entity0 's effort had found the net much debate arose on social media over whether @entity4 's wing wizard had meant to shoot or cross @entity0 shoots at goal during a disappointing day for @entity43 's side who may have surrended top spot the shot soon caused debate among fans on social media with some reckoning the kick was a cross which went horribly awry rather than a direct effort at goal			1
whether @entity0 meant it or not , had the ball sailed in it would surely have been up there with some of the wideman 's finest strikes			0
@entity15 's successful attempt from such a distance is one of the finest , most memorable goals of the @entity65 era			1
aged just 21 , @entity15 received the ball in his own half and spotted @entity17 goalkeeper @entity68 off his line before producing a stunning strike from the halfway line which flew perfectly into the back of the net			2
meanwhile , defeat for @entity43 's side on saturday means @entity76 can leapfrog @entity4 at the top of the @entity79 table with a win over @entity81 on sunday			0
