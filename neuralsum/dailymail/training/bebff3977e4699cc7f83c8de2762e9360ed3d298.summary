@entity0 was the unlikely hero for @entity1 , scoring with the last kick of the game to give @entity5 ’s side a 1 - 0 win over @entity7 and close the gap on @entity9 to two points			1
there were 93 minutes on the clock when @entity13 drifted out to the right and crossed for @entity15 to head goalwards			1
@entity7 keeper @entity16 made the save but @entity18 scored from the rebound and as @entity20 celebrated he was hit by a plastic bottle as home supporters pelted the pitch			1
@entity7 had defended well and gone close themselves with former @entity24 forward @entity25 drawing the best save of the game from @entity28			1
@entity48 thought he had scored his first league goal for the visitors after 68 minutes but it was incorrectly ruled out for offside - the @entity51 was level with the last @entity7 defender			1
there was a lively start to the first half with @entity57 booked for chopping down @entity25			0
@entity7 forced their first chance on 10 minutes when @entity59 was foiled by @entity28			2
but although they had the early upper hand it was @entity1 who had the best opportunity of the first half and it fell to @entity48			2
@entity65 played a long ball out of defence which @entity15 cleverly flicked into @entity48 ’s path			0
the ball dropped it front of him around the penalty spot but @entity16 in the @entity7 goal made the save			0
on 20 minutes @entity15 went down dramatically under a challenge from @entity31 and as if to do out - do his opponent the defender responded to the @entity34 inclining his head towards him as he bent down to remonstrate with him for diving by throwing himself down in the penalty area			1
in the resulting melee neither @entity15 nor @entity31 ’s amateur dramatics were punished as yellow cards were shown to @entity65 and to @entity83			1
former @entity85 midfielder @entity84 said on @entity86 : ' my opinion is i do n't think he 's done enough to get a red card ' with @entity31 's hands around the back of his neck , a frustrated @entity15 appears to heatbutt the defender @entity48 looks on with frustration after going close to scoring for @entity1 against @entity7 on sunday evening @entity16 looks crestfallen as @entity1 snatch a late winner to keep them just two points off rivals @entity9 at the top of @entity100 @entity101 happy with ' complete ' @entity1 with @entity16 , @entity104 and @entity105 all also booked , six of the eight defenders on the pitch had to face the second half on a yellow card			1
@entity108 so nearly made sure that @entity7 started that second 45 minutes in front but with one shot that curled just wide and another effort into the side - netting right on the half - time whistle he failed to break the deadlock			2
@entity48 went close again at the start of the second half but he shot into the side - netting with only a defender to beat on the line after @entity16 came out of his goal but failed to reach the ball			0
@entity28 was also beaten moments later but @entity65 was on hand to clear off the line			0
@entity1 coach @entity5 brought on @entity124 for @entity57 and put @entity125 back into the centre of defence			0
the change almost had an instant effect with @entity48 turning in @entity131 ’ pass from the edge of the six - yard box			0
he was level with the last defender and the goal should have stood			0
the bottle is seen thrown from the crowd in @entity7 as the visiting players celebrated the late winner @entity13 goes down clutching his head in stoppage time after being hit over the head with a bottle @entity13 is clearly in pain after being struck on the head by the object in the closing stages of the contest @entity150 man @entity18 celebrates after scoring a last - gasp winner for the @entity153 giants against @entity7 @entity7 responded immediately with @entity25 releasing @entity154 but @entity28 saved well to keep the shot out			1
and the @entity1 stopper then produced the save of the night when @entity25 rifled a left foot shot goalward			0
@entity158 and @entity159 came on for @entity48 and @entity160 with 10 minutes left but on a night when @entity13 – without any pending records to smash – was barely involved it looked like ending in a stalemate that would have suited @entity9 more than the two teams on the pitch			2
but the @entity33 forward came alive in the last moments of the game			2
@entity31 had to slide in to deny him with the penultimate chance of the game			0
and , not to be denied , he then crossed for @entity18 to get the winner			0
@entity13 looks to get @entity1 on the attack during the second half of their clash with @entity7 @entity65 argues with the referee as @entity7 goalkeeper @entity16 , as @entity15 went unpunished players of both @entity7 and @entity1 then got involved in a heated discussion after the incident			1

@entity1 gained all three points with a last - gasp 1 - 0 win over @entity7 at the @entity35
@entity0 converted inside the area before @entity13 was hit by a bottle
@entity15 earlier appeared to headbutt @entity31 as the @entity33 defender remonstrated with the @entity34
@entity31 had fairly challenged @entity15 inside the area , but looked unhappy at how the @entity1 man went down
he approached @entity15 , putting his hands behind the @entity34 's head , before @entity15 moved his head forward
@entity15 *connected* with the defender 's jaw , before players from both sides came together to argue
the @entity1 star went unpunished from @entity201 referee @entity200
