‘ her mum , @entity1 , even came round and stayed with us because we were holding each other together			2
but all the time @entity71 ’s body was above our heads , all alone wrapped in bin bags and @entity111 had killed her			2
‘ but i did n’t know , why the hell did n’t i know she was there ? i ’m her grandmother , i should have protected her but i failed her			0
' ‘ i swear , there were no clues that i was living with a monster			0
and if people want to make comparisons they should look at @entity111 ... another @entity193			0
