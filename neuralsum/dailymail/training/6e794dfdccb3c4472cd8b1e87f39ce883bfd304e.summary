by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:20 pm on 30th june 2011 fatal error : lorry driver @entity3 who was jailed after two men died when he did a u-turn on a dual carriageway the driver of a recycling lorry who left two men dead after he did a u-turn on a dual carriageway has been jailed			1
@entity3 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , was convicted of causing the deaths by dangerous driving of @entity16 and @entity17 when he took the short cut across a major trunk road			1
the 59 - year - old former @entity21 man claimed he had seen their van coming but thought he had time to complete the manoeuvre , not realising they were speeding			1
@entity3 pulled into a lay - by at @entity26 , between @entity27 and the @entity28 , at about 7am on july 29 last year , so his work colleagues could collect some recycling material during his round for recycling firm @entity32			2
@entity3 made the decision to complete a u-turn though a gap in the central reservation to collect recycling from properties on the other side of the road - a manoeuvre that was permitted on the road and he had completed in the past without difficulty			2
but a @entity47 van , driven by 25 - year - old mr @entity16 , smashed into the lorry at about 70mph , leaving the driver and mr @entity17 , his 30 - year - old boss , with fatal head injuries			1
@entity51 at @entity52 , judge @entity53 said : ' the manoeuvre you wished to take required particular care because of the large size of your lorry and the speed at which traffic was approaching from behind			2
in your mind you thought it was safe			2
' you seriously misjudged the speed of the oncoming vehicles			0
just before your manoeuvre was completed , the transit van struck your vehicle with such force that it turned over			0
' i do take into account the transit van was driving in excess of the allowed speed			0
it appears the van did not brake at all as it was coming towards you			0
' the families of mr @entity16 and mr @entity17 have lost their loved ones			0
they were both young men with the rest of their lives ahead of them			0
' the judge said @entity3 had never been in any trouble in the past and was heading towards retirement with an unblemished driving record of over 30 years			1
@entity3 , dressed in a shirt and tie , stared straight ahead as the judge handed him two three - year sentences to run concurrently and a driving ban of three years			1
@entity93 , prosecuting , described @entity3 's actions as an ' accumulation of errors ' , from pulling out across the carriageway to wrongly assessing the time he had to complete the manoeuvre			0
he said the raw emotion of the families ' grief was clear			0
in mitigation @entity103 told the court that @entity3 , who is the sole carer for his wife , had an ' impeccable ' character			1
' he is summarised as a man who is well loved and respected and considered a reliable , steady figure and above all honest , ' mr @entity103 said			1
' he nearly retired without so much as a speeding fine			0
he has driven hundreds of thousands of miles			0
' mr @entity103 said @entity3 had suffered nightmares since the collision : ' he is not a man of stone and knows the effect of his driving on those two families			1

former @entity21 man gets three years for causing *accident*
court hears blunder was his only mistake in 30 years
