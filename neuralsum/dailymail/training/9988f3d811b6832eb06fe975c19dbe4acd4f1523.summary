by @entity0 storing data on tapes may seem a little antiquated , since the invention of cds , cloud services and other forms of digital storage , but it is still used by many businesses and archives around the world			0
and now , by tweaking how it produces this magnetic tape , @entity12 has created a way to boost the potential of the iconic material to not only match its digital rivals , but also surpass them			2
the @entity20 firm has developed tape for businesses that can store up to @entity23 of data - 74 times the capacity of traditional tapes and the equivalent of 3,700 blu - rays			1
by tweaking how it produces the magnetic tape used in traditional cassettes , stock image pictured , @entity12 has created a way for the iconic material to make a comeback			1
the @entity20 firm has developed tape that can store up to @entity23 of data - 74 times the capacity of current tapes and the equivalent of 3,700 blu - rays @entity12 ’s new tape consists of a soft magnetic underlayer with a smooth surface created using a vacuum thin film forming technique called sputter deposition			1
sputter deposition involves shooting argon ions onto polymer film to produce layers of extremely fine crystal particles in a uniform pattern			1
until now , when the sputter method was used to create this layer of magnetic particles , it changed the shape and layout of the crystal and made the underlayer feel rough			0
this variation in size restricted how much data could be stored on it			0
by optimising the sputter technique , as well as developing the smooth , soft magnetic layer , @entity12 made it possible to shrink the crystals while keeping their shape - increasing the recording density			2
it could , in theory , be used by anyone but has been designed specifically for organisations that need to store large amounts of data			0
magnetic tapes with a coating of magnetic powder are currently used as the mainstream form of tape storage media - with a recording capacity of @entity77			2
previously , if companies wanted to increase this capacity , they ’d need to use technology to shrink the size of the magnetic particles on which data is stored			0
this can be a tricky and expensive process , and in many cases , is n’t cost effective			0
@entity12 ’s new tape consists of a soft magnetic underlayer with a smooth surface created using a vacuum thin film forming technique called sputter deposition			1
sputter deposition involves shooting argon ions onto polymer film to produce layers of extremely fine crystal particles in a uniform pattern , just 5 micrometres thick			1
until now , when the sputter method was used to create this layer of magnetic particles on a polymer film , it changed the shape and layout of the crystal and made the underlayer feel rough			2
@entity12 's new tape consists of a soft magnetic underlayer with a smooth surface , created using a vacuum thin film forming technique called sputter deposition			1
sputter deposition involves shooting argon ions onto polymer film , pictured left , to produce layers of fine crystal particles in a uniform pattern , pictured top right @entity12 's magnetic layer of fine particles has an average size of 7.7 nanometres , pictured			1
when the magnetic tape created using this technology was measured it was found to have a recording density of @entity124 per square inch			0
this is five times the @entity127 capacity of the tape developed by @entity129 and @entity130 in 2010 this variation in size restricted how much data could be stored on it			0
by optimising the sputter technique , as well as developing a smooth , soft magnetic layer , @entity12 made it possible to shrink the crystals while keeping their shape			2
when @entity12 ’s magnetic tape was measured it was found to have a recording density of @entity124 per square inch - equivalent to approximately 74 times the capacity of traditional coated tape media used for data storage			1
this is also five times the @entity127 capacity of the cassette developed by @entity129 and @entity130 in 2010			0
@entity12 said it will continue to work towards getting this next - generation storage ready to sell , as well as develop the technology to make it even more efficient , ' with the aim of increasing recording densities even further			0

@entity12 ’s next - generation magnetic tape can store up to *185* *terabytes* of data
this is the equivalent to 74 times the capacity of traditional magnetic tapes
it was created by tweaking a process called sputter deposition
the process involves shooting ions onto a layer of polymer film *substrate*
this produces layers of tiny magnetic crystal particles on a smooth surface
the more particles that fit onto magnetic tape , the more data can be stored
