by @entity0 @entity1 is under increased pressure to declare a return to the @entity4 after senior ministers declared it would be ' wonderful ' to have the @entity8 mayor back as an mp			1
speculation has been rife that mr @entity1 will make a pitch for a safe commons seat in the 2015 general election â€“ a year before his term as @entity8 mayor expires			1
allies of mr @entity1 have suggested he could return as a backbencher and continue as @entity8 mayor because running the capital was as much work as one of the great offices of state			1
' @entity23 ' : senior ministers have declared it would be ' wonderful ' to have @entity1 , the mayor of @entity8 , back in @entity26 backbench @entity28 mps have been frustrated by the endless ' soap opera ' about mr @entity1 's ambitions , warning it was a distraction from the local and @entity33 elections			1
but health secretary @entity34 and foreign secretary @entity35 both said he would be a welcome addition to the conservatives in their fight to win an outright majority in 2015			0
asked if mr @entity1 could return to the @entity4 to lead the @entity40 , mr @entity34 told the @entity43 's @entity42 show : ' well that would be wonderful			1
but the point is of course it takes longer than people would like , but i think the @entity51 people understand that @entity52 was n't built in a day and we will get there but we have to have patience			0
' a source close to mr @entity34 insisted he had misheard the question and was simply welcoming the prospect of mr @entity1 coming back to @entity26 rather than speculating on him replacing @entity58			2
mr @entity35 also hailed mr @entity1 as ' one of the great figures of our party ' but signalled he would expect mr @entity1 to abide by his pledge to focus on being @entity8 mayor			1
' i have always been a tremendous fan of @entity1 and the rest of us in parliament would welcome his return to parliament as well as his continued commitment to the great job that he does as mayor of @entity8 but that is for him to decide when and how he does that , ' the foreign secretary told @entity77 's @entity76 show			1
foreign secretary @entity35 is one of the senior ministers putting pressure on mr @entity1 to stand for @entity26 mr @entity1 has told friends he will declare whether he will stand in the general election this summer			2
he is expected to pledge not to take a @entity83 post for the year he remains @entity8 mayor if he makes a comeback as an mp			1
running the capital is the equivalent of holding a big @entity83 post , his allies have said			0
@entity89 , a @entity28 mp ( @entity90 , @entity91 ) , said he believed mr @entity1 would return to fight the next election			1
' he should because he 's done a great job running @entity8			2
i think he could come back in a @entity95 after 2015 ... you want your stars in your government , ' he told the @entity43 's @entity99			0
health secretary @entity34 said the @entity40 had to be ' patient ' about mr @entity1 's return mr @entity89 added however that mr @entity1 should not just be seen as a rival leader to mr @entity58			1
' i think he could occupy any number of cabinet posts			0
this idea that it 's either @entity58 or @entity1 is a false logic			2
you could have @entity1 back in the commons running a big department of state , why not ? ' but ahead of being re-elected mayor , mr @entity1 pledged not to hold down two jobs			2
he said : ' if i am fortunate enough to win i will need four years to deliver what i have promised			0
and having put trust at the heart of this election , i would serve out that term in full			0
' i made a solemn vow to @entity118 to lead them out of recession , bring down crime and deliver the growth , investment and jobs that this city so desperately needs			0
keeping that promise can not be combined with any other political capacity			0
' he has been advised by his former spindoctor and the @entity131 's current spin chief , @entity130 , that he needs to stick to his word if he wants to be taken seriously			0
mr @entity1 's friends have said the way to square that is to have him ruling out taking on any big @entity83 jobs while running @entity8			1
they told the @entity137 : ' that will go down well with people and it wo n't look like he is breathing down @entity58 's neck			0
@entity1 can see that makes sense			2
' the prime minister has already said he would be happy to see mr @entity1 back in the @entity4 at the next election			2
but @entity145 have urged mr @entity1 to stop dithering			0
@entity146 , vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench @entity145 , said : ' undoubtedly , he would be a great addition to parliament , but he needs to get on and decide what he is doing if he is to be taken seriously			0
' a spokesman for the mayor would not be drawn on speculation about his @entity155 told the @entity156 : ' the mayor is concentrated on three things : delivering for @entity8 , campaigning to return @entity28 candidates in this may 's elections and helping to return @entity58 as prime minister of a majority conservative government in 2015			1

speculation rife that @entity1 will make a pitch for a safe seat
allies suggest he could return and continue as @entity8 mayor
