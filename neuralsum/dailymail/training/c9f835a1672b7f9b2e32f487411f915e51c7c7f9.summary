by @entity0 they are ferocious predators , armed with razor - sharp teeth , who lurk in the depths of the world 's largest oceans			0
so unsuspecting rowers were more than a little shocked when they spotted a shark 's fin - in a north @entity11 park			1
the rowers were at a private event on the boating lake in @entity14 , when they saw the @entity17 's fin poking above the surface of the water			1
one of the rowers shouted ' look at that ' as he cowered away from the ominous fin			0
one of the girls screamed so loudly that the boat nearly toppled over			0
but , luckily for the rowers , the shark fin was all part of a prank to celebrate @entity49 on @entity50 , which starts today			1
the stunt was set up using a hand - carved polystyrene fin mounted onto a 3m tubular frame , with internal ballast and flotation devices			2
one of two girls was relaxing on the lake , seemingly unaware the shark fin was coming uncomfortably close to their boat - but her rowing partner suddenly spotted the fin out of the corner of her eye when the girl finally turned and spotted the ominous fin gliding towards out , she let out a petrified scream one girl was so frightened when she saw the fin , pictured left , that she almost toppled out of the boat in disbelief			1
but the girl was soon laughing when she realised the fin - made from polystyrene - was not real , right these two men cowered away from the water in fear as the fin raced towards their rowing boat but the men soon peered closer in curiosity once they realised the fin was probably not real a macabre rowing boat - with a huge bite taken out of it - was also planted at the scene to add to the eery atmosphere			2
the prop was created by @entity91 - winning art director and special effects designer @entity92			0
@entity49 , which runs all week , will feature dozens of programmes about the ocean predators			2
once the rowers realised the makeshift fin was part of a prank , they relaxed and carried on boating one of the girls laughed as she spotted the writing on the side of the fin , which revealed the prank was to promote @entity49 on the @entity50 the promotion on the side of the fin reassured boaters that a @entity17 was not lurking in the lake some of the programmes include @entity111 , in which shark experts @entity112 and @entity114 visit the legendary @entity115 in @entity116 in search of @entity118			1
there is also @entity120 - which counts down the 25th biggest shark myths of all time - and @entity122 , which explores the trend of sharks moving closer to shorelines			0
the line - up also features @entity127 , which explore the myth around the massive prehistoric shark .			0
