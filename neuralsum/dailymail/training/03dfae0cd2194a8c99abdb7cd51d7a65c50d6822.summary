crumbling in a heap in the middle of a field , these giant dishes once stood as a key defence during the @entity5			1
the @entity6 was one of 20 vital relay centres which enabled @entity10 commanders communicate across the globe as relations the @entity12 disappeared behind an @entity14 and the threat of nuclear war grew			2
but now the giant parabolic dishes have been allowed to fall into disrepair in a farmer 's field in rural @entity21 - a distant relic of the clash between @entity24 and @entity25			1
crumbling : the giant dishes which helped @entity10 commanders communicate during the @entity5 are crumbling in a field in @entity21 defence : @entity6 had been strategically crucial since the outbreak of @entity30 @entity6 had been of vital strategic importance during @entity30 the base had been part of a series of radar antennae called the @entity37 radar network			1
this provided long range early warning for raids from @entity40 and the northern elements of @entity42 along the approaches to @entity44 and @entity45 and the central midlands			2
these early warning systems used radar waves to detect enemy @entity50 planes within 30 miles - allowing @entity53 fighters to be scrambled in time to intercept them			1
but years after the end of the war , the site was upgraded , the large antennae dismantled and replaced by the giant 60 - ft - wide parabolic dishes were installed as a massive upgrade			0
relic : @entity6 is one of the last two intact towers of 20 original sites dotted across the @entity64 @entity5 : the giant 60 - foot - wide metal dishes went on to be used for @entity5 spying against @entity67 during the 1950 's for the next three decades , @entity68 become a key link in a communications network used by @entity10 during the height of the @entity5			1
@entity73 student @entity72 , 22 , travelled to the @entity21 field to report on this giant piece of wartime history			2
' i first saw the dishes on urban exploring site and i had to go for a look myself ' he said			0
' it was really interesting after reading about what the site was for , and then turning up and looking at the scale of these dishes and imagining what the site would have looked like a few decades ago			0
@entity88 : @entity6 had been part of the @entity37 radar network but was later used in a @entity10 communication system during the @entity5 ' to see the dishes lying on the ground in a farmer ’s field is a real reminder of what the site used to be			1
' even though most of the site was demolished in 1996 , the cost of removing the dishes was thought to be too much , meaning they still lie in the field today			0
mr @entity72 said : ' before describing what they are they are to those who have n’t seen the @entity108 base before , people are often bemused and fascinated by them			0
' if you are n’t aware of the @entity108 history , you simply do n’t know that these amazing dishes exist			0

@entity6 was part of a vital early warning system during @entity30
giant 60ft dishes helped @entity108 intercept @entity118 *bombing* raids
site in @entity21 was a vital @entity10 communications link during @entity5
now the radar dishes have been allowed to crumble in a field
