violation : @entity0 has been criticised for gathering data from people 's houses with its @entity14 cars upholding an earlier ruling by a federal court , the appeal judges wrote : ' the payload data transmitted over unencrypted @entity5 networks that was captured by @entity0 included emails , usernames , passwords , images , and documents			1
' @entity0 argued that its activities were exempt from wiretap laws , because data transmitted over @entity5 is a ' radio communication ' which is ' readily accessible to the public '			0

' he said : ' users should be protected when a company tries to capture data that travels between their laptop and their printer in their home			0
