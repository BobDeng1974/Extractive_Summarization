by @entity0 this week @entity0 and i have knuckled down to work quite a bit			1
the honeymoon period with @entity4 is over and we 've had to get down to some hard graft			1
do n't get me wrong , i realise that hard graft for us is probably not as strenuous as someone doing a double shift in a factory , but it 's all relative			1
there was still one social commitment that i had to make before @entity0 and i decided to become monks – the birthday party of our good friend @entity15			1
the made in @entity17 stars took a break from filming for @entity15 's ( second left ) birthday			1
from left , @entity21 , @entity15 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 i need to be clear now that we are just good friends – not friends with benefits , or boyfriend / girlfriend – just good friends			1
unlike @entity32 's character in classic late 80s film when @entity30 , i do think that it 's possible for men and women to be friends without sex getting in the way and confusing things			0
i realise most people may find this hard to believe			0
the party started at @entity43 , an amazing 200 - seater gastrodome in the @entity45 district of town			2
@entity47 is one of the hippest restaurants in @entity4 and everyone who is anyone goes there			2
we passed @entity52 on the way in – and she looks even more incredible in the flesh than on film			0
sadly @entity4 like to confuse us foreigners and often when a restaurant is a hit they will have an uptown and downtown version at either sides of @entity63 island			2
sadly we went to the wrong one which meant we were quite late			0
distinguished guests : @entity0 says that @entity21 was looking impeccably dressed ( left ) and @entity15 made friends with @entity69 model , @entity22 party time : from left to right - @entity71 , @entity23 , @entity72 , @entity15 , @entity73 and @entity22 by the time we arrived the food was already served - spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice , @entity76 crab cakes with mango chilli sauce , sashimi of @entity80 beef with fresh wasabi sauce , it was superb and there was lots of it			1
we sheepishly filled the two empty seats at the table and introduced ourselves quietly			0
i 've got to say @entity92 is surprisingly well connected in @entity4 – at the table were actress @entity23 from @entity94 and @entity72 from @entity95 , next to them was @entity97 and @entity98 star @entity73 , supermodel @entity22 , professional racing driver @entity99 , @entity15 's brother @entity99 , and of course the wonderful @entity100 looking impeccably dressed as always			1
i was a bit stumped as to what to get @entity15 as a present			2
i thought of getting some gorgeous @entity106 lingerie - @entity0 has just modelled for them and the collection looks amazing - but giving underwear might seem a bit presumptuous			1
party on : as the night wore on , @entity0 and @entity0 ended up at a private house party , they were n't sure whose house it was but the owner had won an @entity116 you can never go wrong with jewellery however - like handbags and shoes , it 's something a lady can never have enough of			1
at first i considered a pearl necklace but thought this may a bit over the top - we are only friends , after all			0
in the end i opted for some exquisite @entity130 diamond and freshwater pearl earrings in 18k white gold			0
a couple of espresso martinis had us in the mood for dancing and we were whisked off to the @entity139 nightclub next door			0
the venue was amazing - high ceilings , amazing @entity144 artwork and the feel of a 19th century @entity147 opium den. it was around 1am when we arrived and the place was jumping			0
we were given one of the best tables in the house because we were with a-list actors and actresses			0
as the night wore on everyone started to get a bit loose and @entity0 almost thought he was on a promise with @entity23 but she jumped into a cab at 3am and broke his heart			2
the party started to thin out and so it was time to shoot to the after - party at a private house			1
i 'm not entirely sure where it was , or whose party but whoever owns the place has won an @entity116 – the @entity172 equivalent of a tv @entity173 ( which by the way i 've won )			0
hopefully if the the @entity176 show transfers to @entity173 , i 'll get to hold one of these for real as well			0
lots of love , @entity0 .			2

@entity0 has finally knuckled down to some hard work in @entity4
however , he still had time to attend his ex , @entity15 's birthday party
he also went to a private house party at an emmy award - *winners* home
