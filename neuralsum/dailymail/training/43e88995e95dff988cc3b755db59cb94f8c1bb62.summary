located on the outskirts of an idyllic @entity3 hamlet , the once grand @entity0 belonged to a wealthy @entity5 farmer and landowner			0
but now the former mansion and an adjoining @entity9 listed barn are due to undergo a £ 3.2million transformation into what has been described as a @entity13 ’s - style holiday camp for travellers			1
the plans have infuriated residents in the hamlet of @entity0 , near @entity18 , who claim that with other such camps in the area already they are ‘ being treated like the county dustbin ’			1
@entity24 council plans to turn @entity25 , a 200 - year - old derelict building and grade ii listed barn , into a toilet and shower facility for gipsies at a cost of £ 3.2million - locals have opposed the proposals council bosses , who say they are required by law to provide a transit site , want to demolish the run - down hall dating back to 1828 to provide nine transit pitches , a permanent warden ’s pitch and a play area			1
the barn would become a washing and toilet block and have an office for the warden			0
plans were stalled due to the @entity9 listing of the hall , but the listing was cancelled after a fire three years ago			2
the camp has been approved by planners and will be considered by the full council next month			2
residents fighting to stop the move include builder @entity56 , 66 , who has spent £ 120,000 renovating his ‘ dream ’ retirement cottage opposite the site entrance and fears the £ 250,000 property and others will be left worthless			2
he called the plans an ‘ outrageous use of taxpayers ’ money ’ , adding : ‘ none of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury @entity13 ’s - style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside			1
@entity56 has spent around £ 120,000 renovating his retirement cottage and said he believes the development is a waste of council money , will devalue his home and attract more gipsies to the area @entity0 was previously listed but was taken off the register last year after a fire at the building ‘ these plans have n’t had a single letter of support and i ’m led to believe there has even been an objection letter from other gipsies and travellers			1
there are already gipsy camps in the @entity18 area and it ’s time some other towns bore some of this burden			1
we feel we are being treated like the county dustbin			0
my wife is devastated and can hardly talk about it			0
’ neighbour @entity106 said : ‘ the cost of the site is completely ridiculous			0
’ @entity109 , a website developer , said : ‘ it ’s disgusting that public money is being spent this way			0
the area is now becoming a travellers ’ town			0
’ the property is part of the history of the area and dates back around 200 years but will be demolished @entity56 has launched a petition opposing the development , and is pictured outside his renovated home councillor @entity123 , @entity124 ’s cabinet member for housing , said : ‘ the site is designed to reduce the number of unauthorised encampments as these have a serious impact on residents and businesses			1
' there were 81 unauthorised encampments last year and until we have a transit site in place the police can not use their powers to move travellers on			2
‘ local authorities have a duty to make every effort to bring dilapidated listed buildings back into use			0
’ mr @entity56 said he has traveled several hundred miles in search of the perfect materials for his @entity5 home villagers in @entity150 have branded the cost of the scheme , likened to a @entity154 holiday park , as ridiculous the development was first proposed after a fire at the 19th century building destroyed the interior			1

@entity25 , built in 1822 , will be developed into facilities for gipsies
@entity9 listed barn next to hall to be *converted* into toilets and showers
@entity24 council claims it will return a derelict building back to use
they also said it will *control* numbers of unauthorised gipsy camps
but residents claim £ 3.2million scheme is a waste and will ruin history
have branded proposed development a ' @entity154 - style ' camp for travellers
