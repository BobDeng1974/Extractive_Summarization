by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham published : 03:13 est , 18 july 2014 updated : 04:50 est , 18 july 2014 doctors believed it would be at least six months before @entity3 kicked a ball again following his horror leg break in january 2010			1
it was one of those sickening moments , his right foot dangled limply as he held his leg by the calf			0
@entity13 's latest recruit , in a match against @entity15 while at @entity16 , had made a penetrating run down the left flank , passed the ball and continued into the box			1
@entity20 brother : @entity22 is on the verge of completing a £ 20million move from @entity25 to @entity13 horror : doctors thought the defender would be out for six months after breaking his leg against @entity15 @entity13 agree fee for @entity3 when it was headed back across goal @entity3 leapt to divert the ball under the goalkeeper and into the net , but @entity15 's @entity35 landed heavily on top of him and the leg snapped			1
his team - mates stood with heads in hands			0
@entity16 manager @entity41 held his eyes closed in anguish			0
the left - back had played every single minute of the campaign up until that moment			1
he should n't have played another			0
remarkably , he was back before four months had passed			0
when @entity48 broke his leg playing for @entity50 against @entity51 in october 1999 , under a similarly innocuous challenge from @entity53 , it took him nine months to recover			1
former @entity55 forward @entity54 was out for a week shy of one year following his nightmare leg break from @entity58 's challenge in february 2008			1
it is the sort of injury than can shatter not just a players ' bones but their confidence , but @entity3 has continued to grow as a full - back since			1
agony : former @entity50 striker @entity48 took nine months to recover from a similar injury in 1999 @entity67 ! @entity55 forward @entity54 suffered an horrific leg break against @entity69 in 2008 as a youngster he was highly - rated but failed to get a break			1
he was playing in the first - team of @entity75 side @entity73 aged 18 and the following season went on loan to @entity77			2
he could not make it out of the reserve team and they decided not to make their interest permanent			0
@entity3 moved to @entity84 side @entity83 but @entity85 immediately took him on loan			0
again , he was stuck in their b team and they did not take up an option to buy him			0
then @entity16 came in for the player and it was there he began to make his name as one of the best full - backs in @entity95			2
whereas the likes of @entity97 , at @entity98 , and @entity99 , at @entity85 , are praised for their ability to maraud forward but are considered suspect at the back , @entity3 is different			2
he is equally adept at defending as he is going forward			0
standing 6ft he is tall for a full - back and strong in the air as well as with the ball at his feet			2
cream : the @entity75 full - back made a name for himself as one of @entity95 's best left - backs at @entity16 forward thinking : @entity98 's @entity97 ( @entity113 ) and @entity114 can ignore defensive responsibilities the summer after his leg break , following four years at @entity16 , he signed for @entity25 in an £ 11.3million deal			1
still he continued to blossom			0
last season he was part of an @entity25 back line which conceded just 26 goals in 38 league games , beat off the financial clout of @entity98 and @entity85 to win the @entity124 title and came within 90 seconds of winning the @entity125			1
in that campaign he made two assists , had an 80 per cent passing accuracy and won 107 tackles			0
@entity3 , 28 , has not always gone down the conventional route			0
he turned down the opportunity to move to @entity98 to increase his own chances of progression			0
' if i had gone to @entity98 , i would have won a couple of @entity125 titles , but i would n’t be as happy as i am here at @entity25 , ' @entity3 said			1
at @entity25 he developed a strong relationship with manager @entity138 , claiming that ' i think he 's changing our lives ' and ' each year that goes by , i ’ ve improved working with him			2
' that appears soured after @entity138 forced him to train with the reserves ahead of his move to @entity145			2
tough act to follow : @entity22 will replace @entity13 stalwart @entity147 ( @entity113 ) at @entity145 friends reunited : @entity22 will join former @entity25 teammate @entity149 at @entity145 at @entity13 , where he will wear the @entity151 shirt vacated by @entity147 , he will re-join former @entity25 team - mate @entity149			1
on his debut for the @entity124 champions in september 2010 he was awarded man - of - the - match after setting up @entity149 for the only goal of the game , making a typically surging run down the left before cutting a low ball back for the striker to tap in			1
how he , and @entity13 fans , will be hoping for a similar debut again .			0

@entity22 is close to a £ 20m move from @entity25 to @entity13
@entity75 left - back will fill @entity147 's boots at @entity145
@entity3 suffered an horrific leg break while playing for @entity16 against @entity15 in january 2010
doctors *expected* him to be out for six months but he was back in four
@entity48 and @entity54 *struggled* to recover from similar injuries
@entity3 won @entity95 and came within minutes of claiming the @entity125 last season with @entity25
he will be reunited with his former teammate @entity149 with the @entity20
