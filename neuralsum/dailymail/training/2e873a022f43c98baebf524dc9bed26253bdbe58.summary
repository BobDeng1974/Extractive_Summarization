by @entity0 an @entity2 abuse victim who was beaten with a shovel and left to sleep outside by his adoptive parents more than a decade ago has won a $ 1 million settlement from state social services			1
@entity7 , 20 , was awarded the sum on friday following @entity2 's @entity10 decision to place him with @entity13 couple @entity12 and @entity14 in 2001 - despite repeated complaints from his immediate family about abuse			1
the @entity14 's were jailed in 2004 for 17 months for the treatment they dished out to @entity20 over three years , which included breaking his arm and keeping him outside for so long he had to endure maggots infesting open wounds			1
settled : @entity25 has been awarded $ 1 million from @entity2 's @entity26 for abuse suffered more than a decade ago baptized @entity28 by his cocaine addicted mother , he was re-named @entity31 by the @entity14 's and now is on his third name , @entity25			1
he was taken away from his drug - addicted mother in july 1999 after authorities received 26 reports he was at risk of being hurt because of her and her partner 's drug problem			2
he then went to live with his great aunt and in july 2000 , it was decided that he should go and join his other step - brother and sisters who had been placed with @entity12 and @entity14 at their home in @entity13			1
they had excellent references and state services said that they were doing such an excellent job with @entity20 's three siblings that it made sense to place him there			1
at first , @entity20 remembers a happy life playing basketball on the streets with his two stepsisters , one step - brother and neighbors			1
then , suddenly , the @entity14 's told the children in their care that they could no longer play outside			1
all the furniture was removed from their bedrooms			0
locks were placed on the outside of their bedroom doors			0
guilty : @entity14 and @entity68 in the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity2 , friday , on september 17 , 2004 during their trial			1
@entity14 and her husband @entity12 were arraigned of 54 counts relating to their treatment of their adopted children and eventually served 17 months in prison speaking to the @entity78 , @entity20 said that he was confused by what his new carers were doing			1
' @entity83 kids thought it was our fault , ' said @entity20 , who has grown to stand 6 ' 9 " since being taken away from the @entity14 's in 2004			1
his aunt , @entity86 noticed the change in demeanor in her nephew when she flew from her home in @entity91 to visit in may 2001 for an unannounced visit			0
' all the kids ran to the door , ' she said to the @entity78			0
@entity94 recalled how the @entity14 's refused to invite her in and tried to get them to meet at a local @entity97 's instead			1
insisting on seeing how the children lived , @entity94 said that when she and her police officer husband entered the house they saw the locks and a bucket in the corner of the children 's rooms , which acted as a toilet			2
' it was n't like a little boy 's room with toys and shoes and magazines or comics , ' @entity94 said in a recent interview			0
' it was like somewhere very very very frightening			0
' @entity94 and her husband contacted @entity2 's @entity118 but according to her , no one even came out to hear or take an account of their troubling story or returned their phone calls afterwards			2
despite the large settlement , state officials have refused to take responsibility for the abuse suffered by @entity20 and say they have no record of the complaints			1
the aunt should have called police if she was so concerned they have said			0
however , the worst was still to come			0
after may , 2001 , the @entity14 's moved to a remote compound near @entity134 in @entity2 and put the children to work on the land			1
they pulled them out of school and began to systematically beat @entity20 and his siblings			2
' no matter what we said , we were just constantly getting beat , ' he said			0
change : @entity20 suffered horrifying abuse at the hands of his adoptive parents @entity12 and @entity14 in the early part of the century ' at first it started out with belts and switches and hands and whatnot			1
when we moved out to @entity134 , it was logs , metal pipes , shovels , anything they could get their hands on			1
' @entity20 has said that @entity14 was the worst and despaired to the @entity78 that the worst part was her parent 's were their neighbors and did n't act to protect the children			1
they were banished outside in @entity2 's freezing temperatures and slept huddled up where they could in tarps and under broken - down vans on the property			2
the children were given kerosene lanterns in winter for heat and one evening @entity20 awoke to find himself on fire after falling asleep next to one outside			2
@entity68 threw snow on him to put the blaze out			0
even though he suffered third - degree burns across most of his body , he was never taken to the hospital and the @entity14 's kept his wounds clean by rubbing alcohol on them - causing @entity20 excruciating pain			1
in one horrific account , @entity20 said that one night as his burns were healing he felt something moving on his legs and looked down			0
maggots had begun to live and infest his wounds and the @entity14 's used a bristle brush to get them out			2
one winter day following that , he was moving wood around the property and the glove he was wearing on his right hand had a hole over the finger			0
' it just got colder and colder , ' @entity20 said			0
he lost his finger tip to frost - bite afterwards			1
in another violent incident , @entity14 struck him in the face with a shovel and knocked out a tooth and @entity20 said he would only be fed if he worked so hard he wanted to pass out through exhaustion			2
at last , @entity14 's parents phoned the police in july 2004			1
engaged : @entity20 is now engaged and hoping to be married this year to his fiance√© she panicked and tried to escape with @entity20 and his youngest sibling - all the while hitting @entity20 with a metal pipe in the car			2
his arm broke and swelled to twice the normal size			0
they ended up in a @entity219 , where @entity14 bought @entity20 some gummy worms , but became so annoyed he could n't open the bag she grabbed them off him and threw them out the window			2
eventually they returned to the @entity134 compound where state troopers arrested the @entity14 's			1
@entity20 spent the next three weeks in the hospital , undergoing skin grafts and treatment for malnourishment			0
' i got food and a bed and a tv , people to see and talk to , ' he said			0
@entity12 and @entity14 ended up facing between them faced 92 counts of abuse , neglect , kidnapping and child endangerment for their treatment of the children			2
the charges were changed in a plea deal to felony assault and criminal nonsupport against @entity14 and felony child endangerment against @entity12			0
they each served 17 months			0
@entity255 , @entity252 and his wife , @entity253 , the children 's grandmother , were charged with mistreating the children as well			0
@entity20 is adamant that although he understands that the state believed the @entity14 's were good parents on paper , they should have followed up with visits and listened to the complaints of his aunt			1
' they could have checked in on us at random times , ' @entity20 said			0
' they could have looked in the background of all of us kids and seen that we looked like a troubled group			0
' @entity272 , director of the @entity26 said that the state will admit no wrongdoing			0
' the only lesson to be learned was that @entity10 does not have a crystal ball that will perfectly predict the future , ' she said to the @entity78 .			0
