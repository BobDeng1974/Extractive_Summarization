thousands of immigrants conned their way into @entity2 by pretending to be skilled workers - when they actually came to do menial jobs such as working in kebab shops			1
immigrants were able to get visas for supposedly skilled jobs thanks to the connivance of rogue employers			1
one created a post for a migrant of ‘ sales and business development manager ’ - for a small high street kebab shop			1
officials are now in the process of rounding up and deporting thousands of foreign workers			2
ministers say they were able to exploit ‘ incompetence ’ in a supposedly tough points - based system introduced by the previous government in 2008			1
the so - called @entity39 of @entity41 ’s immigration system allowed people from outside the @entity43 to get a visa only if they had been offered a ‘ skilled ’ job in the @entity2 that could not be filled by a @entity2 or @entity43 worker			1
employers were required to obtain approval from the @entity49 to sponsor migrants , but checks were far from thorough , only looking to see whether the business was trading			0
employers and migrants could therefore work together to cheat the system , with employers sometimes receiving payments worth thousands of pounds			2
the rules have since been tightened ; officials now scrutinise the roles the migrants are supposedly coming to fill , the business ’s turnover and tax arrangements , and , crucially , how many people it employs			0
@entity68 immigration minister @entity67 has criticised @entity41 for their open door immigration policy and the ‘ incompetence of the @entity71 in administering it ’ the rate of visas refused under the new rules has rocketed from less than 2 per cent to 37 per cent , suggesting abuse of the old regime was rampant - with potentially tens of thousands slipping through the net			1
checks have now been carried out on historic files and up to 2,500 migrants who conned their way into the country are in the process of being sent home			0
last night @entity68 immigration minister @entity67 criticised @entity41 for their open door immigration policy and the ‘ incompetence of the @entity71 in administering it ’			2
he added : ‘ our reforms are cracking down on abuse ... we are building an immigration system that works for @entity2 nationals and legitimate migrants and is tough on those who flout the rules			2
’ in october , two men were jailed for fronting a scam immigration sponsorship firm called @entity98 , which claimed it was recruiting management level migrants for it jobs , when , in fact , they were working in fast food restaurants and supermarkets			1
a newsagent and off - licence created a post of full - time hr manager … for its three staff fast - food shops recruited press and @entity112 managers a high street kebab shop employed a ‘ sales and business development manager ’ a newsagent claimed it needed a £ 30,000 per annum sales manager petrol stations sought full - time business development managers a fishmonger advertised for a second general manager ’s post for its total staff of six the judge criticised the now - defunct @entity71 for granting the @entity126 - run business a sponsor licence in 2008 and for its failure to monitor the firm afterwards			1
the @entity71 gave 117 certificates of sponsorship to @entity98 over three years			0
of those , 50 led to visas and it was estimated more than 120 family members were granted additional visas			0
@entity137 and @entity138 , who ran the scam , netted at least £ 500,000 by selling the work permits for £ 3,500 - £ 4,500 each			0
under @entity41 , there was also widespread abuse of the separate @entity143 , which later became @entity144 of the points system			0
this route was supposed to allow the brightest migrants to come to the @entity2 to look for a job even if they had no advance offer			2
at least 30 per cent of @entity144 migrants were later found to work in low - skilled roles such as stacking shelves , driving taxis or working as security guards			0
others did not have a job at all .			0
