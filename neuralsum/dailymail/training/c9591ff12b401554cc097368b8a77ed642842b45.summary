the juggernaut computer system that pays out more than $ 100 billion a year in welfare to people across @entity4 is on the brink of collapse according to @entity8 's human services minister			1
@entity10 's archaic @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , which was set up in 1983 , is reportedly unable to cope with demand and the government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the outdated software			1
human services minister @entity15 told @entity16 : ' very few organisations around the world still use this type of computer system and that makes finding and attracting skilled staff difficult			1
' ' to deal with the increased demands over the years the original system has literally had another 350 systems bolted on			0
to put it simply , we are running a turbo - charged @entity29 with a spoiler in the age of the @entity32 , ' ms @entity15 explained			2
when it was first launched the database management system only handled $ 10 billion worth of payments to around 2.5 million people			2
it is now buckling under the pressure of serving out cash to 7.3 million citizens			0
human services minister @entity15 , seen here in 2013 , has described the department 's it system as a ' @entity29 ' ' the government is currently considering whether to replace the current welfare payments it system , ' ms @entity15 said			1
' despite its age and extraordinary complexity , the @entity48 's payment system is very reliable and has an extremely high level of payment accuracy			1
' the minister said one of the issues with the current system is that it creates additional work for staff and customers			1
' for example , the current system is built around individual payments and not the person , or their family			2
this means every time a customer starts a new claim they are treated as a new customer and have to provide some or all of their details again , which causes understandable frustration , ' ms @entity15 explained			0
' the department has a highly skilled and committed team of @entity77 experts working in this area , some of who have worked on the system for more than two decades			0
the government now faces a significant challenge to retain this level of knowledge into the future let alone attract new it staff			0
' the @entity89 database management system , designed by the @entity90 of @entity91 , is also used by the @entity48 , the headquarters of the @entity48			1
the @entity10 it database was built in 1983 and is in urgent need of an overhaul according to treasurer @entity96 ( right ) ms @entity15 is not the first government member to call for an overhaul of the 30 - year - old system			1
in april 2014 , treasurer @entity96 told radio show @entity100 that upgrading the it infrastructure was essential			1
' we have to do it			0
the question is how we will do it and how we will ensure that we improve service delivery into the future , ' mr @entity96 said			0
he described the system as ' ageing ' and ' in bad shape ' and said it is ' inhibiting the capacity of the government , to some degree , to roll out policy that properly addresses problems in the economy and in the budget '			2
@entity15 , seen here in the @entity120 , believes the it system needs an upgrade and in 2013 , human services chief information officer @entity123 described the @entity9 system as ' a soldier '			1
he told the website it news : ' the @entity9 system has been a trusted servant of our social welfare program … a lot of people call it legacy … i prefer to call it heritage			2
' talking about his dreams of an upgrade he said : ' i will be looking at whatever solution can service the business needs that we have			0
' mr @entity123 has human services minister @entity15 on board after he was granted a $ 16.2 million budget to put forward a business case for a replacement or upgrade of the major @entity10 it system			1
the cost was met from within the existing resources of the department			0
the government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the @entity156 software a statement from the department in 2013 said : ' an upgraded system will have increased capacity to support the current and changing needs of @entity4 and enable the department to continue to support and deliver @entity163 programs efficiently and effectively			0
' this will enable us to build on the work we are already doing to give customers a greater degree of convenience , simplicity and security through improved access to online and self - service options			0
no customer payments will be affected by this measure and customers do not have to do anything to benefit			0
