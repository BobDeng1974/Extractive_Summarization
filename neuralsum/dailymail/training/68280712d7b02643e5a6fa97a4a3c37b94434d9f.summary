warning : @entity0 , the @entity1 , claimed some elderly patients are starving on wards and are being treated without dignity tens of thousands of elderly patients are enduring appalling @entity8 care because they are too frightened – or too polite – to complain			1
they suffer in silence fearing even worse treatment if they dare to raise criticism , @entity11 ’s health watchdog dame @entity9 warned			1
she said she had investigated cases of pensioners being effectively starved on wards and treated without a shred of dignity			2
but these , she believes , are just the tip of the iceberg because many over- 65s are reluctant to complain			1
she said : ‘ often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint , or they simply do n’t like to “ make a fuss ”			2
’ @entity0 , the @entity1 , said this fear prevents the health service learning from mistakes			1
while pensioners receive around half of all @entity8 care , just a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly – indicating their voices are not being heard			1
the damning comments from such a high - profile figure are significant because they indicate that , despite all the reforms announced after the @entity45 scandal , little has changed			0
the @entity46 has highlighted the failure of the health service to listen effectively to patients as part of its dignity for the @entity54 campaign			0
now the ombudsman has demanded a ‘ significant cultural shift ’ in the way complaints are handled			1
she believes a single body should handle all complaints about health , social care and other services			0
she said : ‘ only with a significant changein attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reforming the complaints system will the @entity8 make the improvements it needs			1
’ under the present system , people must complain to the offending trust first , and only if they are dissatisfied can they contact the ombudsman			0
despite being the last port of call for complaints , @entity0 receives around 16,000 every year			0
of 904 @entity8 cases she investigated between april and december last year , 222 concerned the elderly			0
no fuss : while pensioners receive around half of all @entity8 care , just a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly - indicating their voices are not being heard ( file picture ) she said : ‘ there are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people			1
misdiagnosis , staff attitudes , poor communication with patients and families , substandard nutrition , and patients not being treated with dignity , just to name a few			1
’ one older man with @entity103 ’s and diabetes was prevented from going home to die beside the brother he had lived with his whole life			0
this , she said , was the result of a ‘ string of errors by five organisations across health and social care ’			0
‘ they left it a month before they had a meeting about his care , by which time he ’d passed away without his dying wish being honoured			0
’ in another case , a hospital did not consult the family on a decision not to resuscitate and in a third , staff switched off a patient ’s life support against a family ’s express wishes			1
research by @entity0 ’s organisation found that a quarter of older people do n’t know how to complain			1
‘ complaints are a gift to the @entity8 because that is how improvements are achieved , ’ she said			0
reform : she believes a single body should handle all complaints about the @entity8 , social care and other services ‘ older people should be encouraged to complain and should be taken seriously when they do			2
but my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence			0
’ we may be ‘ seeing the tip of the iceberg ’ , she said , calling for a new single @entity153			2
‘ people need and deserve a joined - up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same person , ’ she said			2
@entity158 , director of the charity @entity159 , said : ‘ it is not acceptable for any patient not to receive adequate nutrition or hydration , not to have their personal hygiene attended to , and not to be treated with basic dignity and respect			0
‘ preventing abuse and neglectful care must be a priority for the @entity8			0
we see some moves to improve complaints processes and listen to feedback from older people , but we need to go much further and faster			2
’ if you feel your complaint has been dealt with unfairly by the @entity8 in @entity11 , contact www.ombudsman.org.uk			0
by @entity9 , health service @entity177 older people are some of the most frequent users of the @entity8 but they are less likely to complain about treatment and care when standards slip to unacceptable levels			1
our research shows that a quarter of older people do n’t know where to go to complain about the @entity8 , despite using the service more often than people under 65			1
complaints are a gift to the @entity8 because that is how improvements are achieved			0
older people should be encouraged to complain and taken seriously when they do			0
problems : many elderly patients do not complain about conditions because they do not want to make a fuss ( file picture ) but my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence			1
almost 80 per cent of all the investigations we carry out are about @entity8 services			0
even though nearly half of @entity8 care and services are given to older people , only a third of the health complaints we investigate are about the care of older people			1
the @entity1 is the final step for people who have been treated unfairly or received a poor service from the @entity8 in @entity11 , or a government department or agency			1
our role is to investigate complaints without taking sides and make recommendations to put things right			0
but older people ’s reluctance to complain , coupled with their not knowing where to go to make a complaint , could mean we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg of serious failings in the care of people who are 65 and over			1
of the cases we do see , there are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people			2
misdiagnosis , staff attitudes , poor communication with patients and families , substandard nutrition , and patients not being treated with dignity , just to name a few			2
small proportion : of 904 @entity8 cases @entity0 investigated between april and december last year , 222 concerned the elderly we believe there still needs to be a significant cultural shift in the way complaints are handled across the health and social care system			1
more needs to be done to tackle the toxic cocktail of reluctance by patients , carers and families to complain , and a defensive response from the @entity8 when they do			0
making a complaint should be easy and transparent			0
often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint , or they simply do n’t like to ‘ make a fuss ’			0
but complaining can make a difference and often people tell us they made a complaint because they do n’t want the same thing happening to somebody else			0
if people are n’t satisfied with the way the complaint has been handled by the @entity8 , then they can make a complaint to us , the @entity1			1
we know older people often rely on both @entity8 and social services and our joint investigations of treatment and care failings , with the @entity275 , have highlighted the heartbreaking consequences when older people fall through the gaps between health and social care services			2
people deserve a joined - up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same person throughout			2
and that ’s why we want a single @entity153 for @entity11 and the @entity286 , which puts people at the centre of the complaints process , to be responsible for all complaints concerning public services , including health and social care			1
only with a significant change in attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reform will the @entity8 make the improvements it needs to ensure all older people are treated with dignity and respect .			1

dame @entity9 said elderly patients were starving on wards
@entity1 said it is tip of iceberg
only a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly
she is demanding a significant shift in the way complaints are handled
almost half of @entity322 ’s sufferers are **denied** vital medication while in hospital , say campaigners . they say that many leave in a worse state than when they were admitted . sufferers may need ten tablets a *day* at set times , but while in hospital they must rely on staff to provide pills . research shows *47* per cent of people with the *neurological* condition were **denied** regular access to their medication while in hospital .
