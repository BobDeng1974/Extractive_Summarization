@entity1 and @entity2 cricket officials say their national teams will likely to meet in the world 's first day - night test match in november next year , either at @entity6 or @entity7			1
@entity8 , @entity10 chief , and his @entity12 counterpart @entity11 said that talks in @entity14 last week advanced plans for the match and both countries ' are supportive of the innovation and its clear benefits			2
' @entity2 are scheduled to tour @entity1 from late 2015 and @entity8 said the venue for the historic match had been narrowed down to the @entity22 or @entity6 's @entity23			1
play would likely begin at 2 pm each day and a pink ball will be used			1
historic : the @entity22 is one of two venues being considered by @entity10 for a day - night test setting : the @entity23 in @entity6 could host the day - night test between @entity1 and @entity2 ' we are serious about pushing ahead with the concept of day - night test cricket , ' @entity8 said			1
' we feel it will only strengthen the position and possibilities for test cricket in many parts of the world , ' he added			2
' there are many test matches played during non-holiday periods when adults are at work and kids are at school			0
that 's not an ideal way to promote the highest form of the game			0
' @entity8 said there was no intention of shifting @entity1 's marquee @entity52 or @entity53 matches to a day - night format ' given they are staged at the peak of holiday season , ' but matches in non-holiday periods would be considered			1
new ground : @entity2 , pictured on their 2011 tour of @entity1 , will be the opposition if plans go ahead a pink ball would be used for a day - night test he said data showed annual tests at @entity69 , @entity1 , which ends at around 9 pm @entity71 east coast time each day , rated 40 per cent higher than other matches played at the same time of year			1
' we believe that 's evidence in itself that we 'll get greater viewership and more opportunities for people to attend , ' @entity8 said			0
he accepted cricket traditionalists might not support day - night test matches , but believed the commercial and other benefits outweighed reservations about tradition			2
' i do n't think we 're ever going to get to a stage where everyone is completely satisfied or comfortable with it , ' @entity8 said			0
' but i think if we go back 30 - odd years in time when the first - ever day - night one - day internationals were played , i 'm sure there was that same level of trepidation among some stakeholders including players about things like day - night cricket and white ball , ' he said			1
@entity11 said tradition was not in itself an excuse to reject innovation			0
' people have talked about messing with the traditions of @entity96 , ' he said			0
' but since it was first played in ( 1877 ) there 's been significant changes - covered pitches , fielding restrictions , over limits , introduction of helmets , change in the no - ball law etc. tradition : the annual @entity114 and @entity115 are not being considered for the plans audience : @entity53 matches in @entity69 finish around 9pm on the @entity71 east coast and attract many viewers ' i think as administrators we must keep evolving and improving the game for our stakeholders			2
we need to be mindful of change , but keep an open mind on these things			0
' @entity8 said trials would continue to develop a pink ball , which closely mirrors the performance of the red ball currently used in test cricket			1
trials had already been carried out in @entity1 's domestic @entity136 competition and those would likely continue in @entity1 and @entity2 this year			0
he said consultation will also continue with both nations ' players ' associations , the @entity138 , fans and broadcasters .			0

@entity144 will take place in either @entity7 or @entity6
play would begin at around *2pm* each day and pink ball would be used
