by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 24 october 2013 if you are always hungry and just ca n't shed the pounds , then scientists may have discovered the reason why			2
@entity6 researchers have discovered a ' hungry gene ' which they believe could cause obesity			1
the @entity10 study has identified a possible genetic root to the insatiable appetite and slow metabolism in some people			2
scientists have discovered a ' hungry gene ' which they believe could explain the insatiable appetite and slow metabolism in some people looking at 2,101 patients who were severely obese , they found those with mutations of a gene called @entity22 were hungrier and burned less calories than people with a normal copy of the gene			1
dr @entity27 , of @entity10 , said : ' changes in diet and levels of physical activity underlie the recent increase in obesity			2
' however , some people gain weight more easily than others			0
this variation between people is largely influenced by genetic factors			0
' the discovery of a new obesity gene , @entity22 , demonstrates that genes can contribute to obesity by reducing the metabolic rate - i.e. how well the body burns calories			1
' dr @entity27 said the discovery could now provide clues to how obesity develops in children and help pave the wave for new drugs to treat the condition as well as type - 2 diabetes , which is commonly linked with it			1
further experiments in cells showed the @entity22 mutations also impaired metabolic processes in the body , such as the breaking down of glucose and fatty acids , which produce energy			1
the study authors also found the diabetes drug metformin corrected the low levels of fatty acid oxidation in cells with the @entity22 gene , suggesting it could be a potential treatment in the future			1
' this work adds to a growing body of evidence that genes play a major role in influencing a person 's weight and may be useful for developing new ways to treat people who are heavy and develop diabetes			2
all in the dna ? scientists found those with mutations of a gene called @entity87 were hungrier and burned less calories than people with a normal copy of the gene the study was published in the journal @entity94			1
another rogue stretch of dna that stops us feeling full and craving sugary and fatty foods - the @entity100 gene - was discovered several years ago			0
the gene , carried by more than half of the population , prevents a drop in the hunger hormone ghrelin after eating			0
the 16 per cent of the population that carries two copies of the rogue dna are 70 per cent more likely to become obese than those without the gene			0
they eat up to 200 extra calories a day and are almost half a stone heavier than their average counterparts			0
and for those with the ‘ hunger gene ’ dieting is doomed to failure			0
even those who have inherited just one flawed @entity100 gene – 49 per cent of the population – are 30 per cent more likely to be obese .			0
