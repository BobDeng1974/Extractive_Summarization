dangerous criminals nearing the end of their sentences who are released from prison for the day are to be fitted with new satellite tracking devices to ease public fears over safety			1
justice secretary @entity9 is planning to introduce the new tags next month , @entity8 understands			1
the most serious offenders – including murderers , rapists and armed robbers – will be tagged first , but by the end of next year , mr @entity9 wants all of the 1,500 prisoners who are released on ‘ temporary licence ’ each day to be tagged			1
@entity24 ( right ) , a mugger serving two life sentences , escaped from @entity26 , @entity27 , last month basic tags have been used by the prison system for the past 15 years , mainly for minor offenders who have been offered early release or a non-custodial sentence			1
they are linked to a ‘ base station ’ in their homes , only allowing the prison service to check whether they have obeyed a dusk - to - dawn curfew order			1
the new models are equipped with @entity41 ( gps ) technology , which means if offenders go on the run the police can find them immediately			2
the system , which has to be worn 24 hours a day – ‘ bath , bed , everything ’ according to a source – contains a battery that is recharged from the mains			2
the police are alerted if the tag runs out of charge			0
mr @entity9 is introducing the new devices after a spate of cases in which convicts have committed violent crimes after absconding from open prisons			2
earlier this year @entity19 – an armed robber known as the ‘ @entity20 ’ because he pistol - whipped his victims – committed an armed robbery at the same building society he had held up at gunpoint 13 years earlier after failing to return to @entity26 open prison in @entity27			1
it was the third time @entity19 , 55 , who was sentenced to 13 life sentences at the @entity68 in 2002 , had absconded during his criminal career			1
he evaded capture for four days			0
the satnav tags will be gradually rolled out across the nation after @entity19 , pictured during an armed robbery , fled from jail last week @entity8 revealed that @entity24 , a mugger who received two life sentences in 2003 for attacking pensioners with a knife , had escaped after also failing to return to @entity26			1
he was recaptured on wednesday			0
mr @entity9 is also keen to ease the pressure on prison places			0
the current prison population of 85,786 in @entity81 and @entity82 is just 2,218 short of full capacity , and it costs the taxpayer more than £ 120,000 for each new prison place created			0
each prisoner costs the state £ 40,000 a year			2
release on temporary licence is used in an attempt to reintegrate offenders who have served lengthy prison sentences back into the community			1
a @entity95 source said : ‘ when this new technology starts to come on stream , we ’ll be able to track offenders on day release far more closely			1
the reality is , if you ’ve got a tag around your ankle and “ eyes in the sky ” watching you , it ’s going to make you think twice about going @entity107			0
’ police are hunting a convicted burglar who has absconded from @entity110 in @entity111			0
he is the third inmate to go on the run from the prison inside a week			2
@entity114 and @entity115 said @entity116 – described as a risk to the public – was last seen at the prison at 5pm on friday			0
the 29 - year - old is serving a 20 - month sentence for a burglary committed in 2010			1
he is believed to be in @entity122			0
he is described as white , 5ft 11ins , of heavy build , with an angular face and receding brown hair			0
he speaks with an @entity127 accent and has a tattoo of a cross on his left arm			0
police are already hunting convicted murderer @entity133 , 30 , and @entity134 , 29 , who are believed to have vanished together from @entity110 on october 25 .			0

dangerous criminals on day release from prison will have satellite tags
murderers and rapists will wear tags when on release near end of sentence
eventually all prisoners on licence will wear them , justice secretary says
