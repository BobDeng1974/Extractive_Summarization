the severe drought that has gripped the western @entity1 for 14 years is literally changing the landscape			1
in total the amount of water lost in the current drought - about 63 trillion gallons - is enough to cover the whole area in six inches ( 15cm ) of water			1
but more alarmingly , scientists have found that the loss of water is causing the entire western @entity1 to rise up like an uncoiled spring			1
researchers in @entity12 say a 14 - year drought is raising the ground			1
@entity16 's crust in some locations has lifted by 0.16 inches in just 18 months			1
these maps of gps points in the western @entity1 show the changes in the landscape , with blue indicating a drop and yellow - red reflecting a rise			1
the research was carried out by scientists at @entity28 at the @entity29			0
since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity1 has seen their driest periods in centuries			1
these states are @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 and scientists in @entity35 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			2
the warnings come after sediment studies showed @entity35 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			2
in 2013 , @entity35 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			0
however droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state			2
looking back over several thousand years , droughts have been known to last over a decade , and in some cases they can last a century			0
and the patterns tend to repeat , meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future			0
investigating ground positioning data from gps stations throughout the west , the researchers dr @entity63 , dr @entity64 , and dr @entity65 found that the water shortage is causing an ' uplift ' effect , this was up to 0.5 inches ( 15mm ) in @entity35 's mountains and on average 0.15 inches ( 4mm ) across the entire western @entity1			1
from the gps data , they estimate the water deficit at nearly 240 gigatons ( 62 trillion gallons ) , equivalent to a six - inch ( 15cm ) layer of water spread out over the entire western @entity1 results of the study , which was supported by the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , appear in the journal @entity83			1
dr @entity63 , a @entity28 assistant research geophysicist , kept noticing the same pattern over the 2003 - 2014 period while looking at data , namely that all of the stations moved upwards in the most recent years , coinciding with the timing of the current drought			2
dr @entity64 , a @entity28 geophysics professor who specialises in studying earthquakes and their impact on shaping the earth 's crust , says the gps data can only be explained by rapid uplift of the tectonic plate upon which the western @entity1 rests			1
he adds , however , that the uplift has virtually no effect on the @entity101 and therefore does not increase the risk of earthquakes			2
the uplift has been linked to the loss of 63 trillion gallons of water in the drought			1
pictured is the @entity110 station @entity111 , located in the @entity112 near @entity113 , @entity35			0
its displacement data was used to determine water changes in the western @entity1 for dr @entity65 , a research meteorologist with @entity28 and @entity81 , the results paint a new picture of the dire hydrological state of the west			1
' these results quantify the amount of water mass lost in the past few years , ' said dr @entity65			2
' it also represents a powerful new way to track water resources over a very large landscape			0
' we can home in on the @entity37 mountains and critical @entity35 snowpack			0
' these results demonstrate that this technique can be used to study changes in fresh water stocks in other regions around the world , if they have a network of gps sensors			0
' when water is lost because of a lack of rain and snow , @entity16 's crust rises			0
it typically sags in the winter and spring , weighed down by water , and it rises during the dry season in summer and fall , said dr @entity63			0
the authors removed those seasonal factors when analyzing about a decade of data from gps stations within the @entity154 's @entity110			0
last year , an area stretching west of the @entity157 witnessed a ' massive uplift , ' dr @entity63 explained			0
the rise was most striking in the @entity37 mountains and @entity35 coastal regions , but it was spread over the entire region , unlike previous years when some pockets have gone up and others went down			0
' it 's just amazing to us that this covers the entire western @entity1 , ' dr @entity63 said			1
the loss of water since last year is equivalent to the annual loss from the @entity171 , according to the study			2
the team hopes authorities use the measurements as a tool to measure the impact of drought			0
on 19 aug 2014 @entity179 near @entity180 , @entity37 ( shown ) dropped to it 's lowest water level ever as the 14 year drought continued throughout the @entity1			1
the drought is clearly visible with the white rock exposed on the side of the mountains in ' @entity189 ' district , seen here			0

researchers in @entity12 say a 14 - year drought is raising the ground
the ground in some locations in several western @entity1 states has lifted by as much as 0.16 inches in just 18 months
this has been linked to the loss of 63 trillion gallons of water in the drought
since 2000 seven states have experienced their driest periods in centuries
and scientists have warned the drought could last up to 100 years
however they add there is apparently no increased risk of earthquakes on the @entity101 fault
