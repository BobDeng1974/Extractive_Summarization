most of us are happy with a toothpaste that costs a couple of pounds			1
but a new generation of super-toothpastes costing up to £ 100 a tube has emerged — with extravagant promises such as rejuvenating gums and regenerating enamel			1
so , is it worth splashing out ? dr @entity11 , chief executive of the @entity12 , who leads an expert panel of dentists that examines manufacturers ’ claims to ensure they are clinically proven , gives his verdict : @entity18 dr @entity19 , £ 8.95 , californiabreathuk.co.uk part of a range by dr @entity23 , dubbed @entity25 ’s ‘ @entity24 ’			1
@entity26 claimed to help with the most stubborn bad breath and fight cavities			1
taste test : this is a dense , clear gel			1
there is none of the familiar foaming action of a conventional toothpaste			1
it glides over the teeth as you brush			1
it does n’t have a bad after - taste , but nor do you get a minty - fresh mouth feel			2
@entity42 ’s verdict : ‘ the toothpaste contains all of the usual ingredients : water , abrasive silica , which is very fine quartz that aids the cleaning process , and flavouring			1
‘ the only extras are xylitol — a sweetener that inhibits the growth of bacteria , which is also found in a lot of supermarket own - brand toothpastes — and flavourings , such as peppermint oil , but nothing to justify the price			1
‘ the claims being made are excessive			2
it says it gets rid of and prevents bad breath — but there is nothing i can see in there that indicates that is going to be the case			2
‘ this is an under - formulated and over-sold product			2
was £ 103.95 , now £ 67.55 ( biovea.com ) the most expensive toothpaste on sale			2
it uses a patented formula with an extract found in cocoa beans , which the company says can replace fluoride			2
taste test : a white paste with mild minty taste			2
this boasts that it is ‘ not harmful if swallowed ’ , and advises users to brush and rinse , then brush a second time and spit out the excess			2
if you swallow it , there is an unpleasant hint of cocoa			2
and a sudden urge to retch			0
@entity42 ’s verdict : ‘ i ca n’t find any robust scientific evidence that this works			1
it ’s fluoride - free , so i ’d be surprised if it had any decay - preventing effect , which is the key thing you want out of a toothpaste			0
‘ in terms of spitting rather than rinsing , i would advise everyone to do that			0
but brushing twice ? other than telling you to use twice as much of a very expensive toothpaste , i ca n’t explain that			0
the price is utterly unjustified — 20 times the cost of a well - researched toothpaste for something fluoride - free			0
you ’d be better off with a 25p fluoride toothpaste from @entity111			0
’ @entity112 dr @entity113 , £ 12 , spacenk.com dr @entity115 is founder of @entity117 ’s @entity116 , which boasts numerous celebrity patients , including @entity119			1
this claims to use hydrogen peroxide to gently whiten teeth			0
it also contains anti-tartar and anti-stain ingredients intended to help teeth stay whiter			0
taste test : a speckled green gel with a moderate foaming action			0
it has a sour minty taste which , thankfully , does n’t linger once you have rinsed			0
@entity42 ’s verdict : ‘ some whitening toothpastes do have an effect , thanks to abrasive ingredients that remove stains from the surface of the teeth			1
it is claimed this one whitens teeth using hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent			0
‘ toothpastes sold in the @entity146 can legally contain only 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide , and the chance of that amount having an effect is virtually non-existent			1
‘ you need to be getting at least 30 times that amount to achieve anything			0
there is nothing that would be costly in any way — a product at an eighth of the price is going to be as good			0
’ @entity160 @entity162 toothpaste , plus ‘ boosting ’ serum kit , £ 40 , selfridges.com said to be the ‘ first dental care system able to reverse the erosion process ’			0
with each use , the ingredients form a fresh supply of enamel mineral which binds to the teeth			1
taste test : the toothpaste itself is glittery - white and the most dense of the four			0
it produces a strange tingly sensation on your gums , but the taste is pleasant and minty			1
the twice - daily toothpaste is used as part of a combination with a serum applied for three days in the month			0
@entity42 ’s verdict : ‘ this one is the result of ten years of research and there are already extensive published scientific studies to support what it says the product ’s doing			1
‘ regenerate as a name is perhaps a little bit misleading , because you ’re not going to regrow enamel			1
what it does is put a new coating of minerals — which appears to be virtually indistinguishable from enamel — over the teeth			1
‘ this is really exciting science			0
it is expensive but , with ten years of research and as a unique product on the market , there ’s a real reason for the premium price			0
