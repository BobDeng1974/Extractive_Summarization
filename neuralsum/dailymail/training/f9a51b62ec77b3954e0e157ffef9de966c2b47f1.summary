by @entity0 forget about the @entity1 who went up a hill but came down a mountain , now two englishmen and a @entity5 have gone up a mountain and come down a hill			2
the three ramblers have stripped a remote mountain in the @entity10 of its status after measuring it at two foot six inches below the official height			1
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 set out to complete @entity19 's most daring mountain survey on @entity21 's peak on the @entity22			1
making a molehill out of a mountain : @entity21 's @entity25 , highlighted , has been downgraded after three amateur cartographers scaled it and found it fell short of mountain status by just six - and - a - half inches ' it was a difficult climb to the summit ' : @entity17 beside the @entity32 on the north - westerly summit of @entity34 , which he and his friends scaled equipped with ropes , harnesses and helmets measurements : the @entity32 is a state - of - the - art , highly precise dual frequency gps mapping tool maps list the jagged rocky peak in the @entity46 mountain range at 3,002ft high , just two feet above the 3,000ft required height for mountain status			1
however it has been a source of controversy among hillwalkers who suspected it fell short of the height given on the maps			2
equipped with state - of - the - art gps technology , the trio carried out the risky climb with ropes , harnesses and helmets			2
then they spent two hours at the summit recording hundreds of measurements			0
while nearby peak @entity65 was confirmed at 3,009ft , the reading for @entity21 's @entity34 fell short of the magic mountain mark of 3,000ft by just six - and - a - half inches			1
as a result , @entity21 's @entity25 has been stripped of its status as a ' munro top ' - the name given to secondary peaks in @entity73 above 3,000ft			1
their escapade is a deflating inversion of the story of @entity78 , a film in which a @entity81 villagers conspire to turn their local hill into a mountain by building an earth cairn on top of it to restore their town 's pride			2
negotiating the ' @entity91 ' on @entity92 on way to the @entity65 : that peak was confirmed at 3,009ft the survey team on the summit of the @entity65 : mr @entity17 and his friends see themselves as carrying on the work of @entity10 mountaineer sir @entity99 , who compiled the first list of @entity10 mountains in 1891 the findings have been accepted by the @entity103 , custodians of the official list of munros and munro tops			1
munros are named after @entity10 mountaineer sir @entity99 , who compiled the first list of @entity10 mountains over 3,000ft in 1891			0
a munro top is also a summit above 3,000ft , but one that is considered a secondary peak of a munro			1
the most famous munro is @entity115 , which stands at 4,409ft tall			0
mr @entity17 , 52 , said : ' we have surveyed over 150 summits in @entity19 but none compared to the task we set ourselves in the @entity120			0
' @entity34 has long been a source of controversy because in the early 1970s it was listed on @entity124 maps as being 2,994ft tall			0
' then , when it appeared in the @entity126 in 1997 , its height was given as 2,998ft which is still below the 3,000ft mark but it was included anyway			1
' current maps list it as 3,002ft			0
' @entity131 have been arguing about its true height for a long time and we wanted to provide a definitive answer			0
' in that sense we are continuing the great work of sir @entity139 in accurately mapping @entity73 's munros			2
' while he had to use an aneroid barometer to get his measurements , we use dual frequency gps mapping tools			0
' it was a difficult climb to the summit but we got the definitive data we were after which confirms it falls short of the 3,000ft mark			2
' on the summit of the @entity65 : the nearby @entity34 has been a source of controversy among hill walkers after its official height kept on changing on different maps published at different times long way down : this shot of the @entity65 summit shows just how risky a climb they had to undertake @entity162 , president of the @entity103 , said the reclassification of @entity21 's peak had been met with mixed reactions from club members			1
he said : ' there are some who think it 's a shame that @entity21 's @entity25 is no longer a munro top because it is very dramatic and one of the hardest to summit			1
' however others are more concerned with having the most accurate list of munro tops possible			0
' the figures speak for themselves though - @entity21 's @entity25 is not 3,000ft high			1
' the @entity103 accepts the findings of the survey and future tables and books will reflect the new classification			0
' @entity184 , a geodetic analyst at the @entity124 , said official maps would now be ammended with the new heights for @entity21 's @entity25 and @entity65			1
he said : ' we are provided with the data which we then cross check			0
the results will be rounded up or down to the nearest metre and then changed on our maps			0
' the survey team setting off on their mission : @entity184 , a geodetic analyst at the @entity124 , said official maps would now be ammended with the new heights for @entity21 's @entity25 and @entity65 pictured left to right : @entity196 , @entity162 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity15 and @entity16 , who all contributed to the work mr @entity15 and mr @entity16 are retired research chemists from @entity204 , north @entity81 , and @entity205 respectively , and mr @entity17 is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near @entity207			1
they have measured over 150 hills in @entity1 , @entity73 and @entity81 since 2008 and downgraded two munro tops previous to @entity21 's @entity211 nan @entity210 and @entity212 a ' @entity213			1
they have also elevated two hills to mountain status , which in @entity1 and @entity81 is classed as 2,000ft			0
in 2008 they measured @entity218 in @entity219 at 2,000ft and 6 inches - up from 1,998ft			2
earlier this year they upgraded @entity221 in the @entity222 from 1,998ft to 2,000ft .			0

@entity21 's peak on the @entity22 had been thought to be 3,002ft high
required height for a @entity73 mountain , or munro , is 3,000ft
but new survey finds it misses that mark by just six - and - a - half inches
