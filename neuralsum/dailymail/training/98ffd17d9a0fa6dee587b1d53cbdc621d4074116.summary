by @entity0 a @entity2 enthusiast has spent one month building a fully functioning keyboard made entirely from the coloured bricks			2
@entity5 , 41 , used more than 1,500 @entity2 pieces to create the keyboard which can be used on any computer			1
@entity2 has captured the imaginations of children and adults for generations resulting in millions of sets being manufactured each year			2
a @entity2 enthusiast has spent one month building a fully functioning keyboard entirely from the coloured bricks mr @entity17 , from @entity18 , in @entity19 , said : ' i had seen some other custom themed keyboards online , built using other materials , and i thought they were pretty cool			1
it sparked my interest in building one using @entity2 bricks			2
' my love for @entity2 began as a child			2
i really enjoyed building and playing with the classic @entity2 space and early @entity34 sets			0
since coming back into the hobby as an adult , i probably have somewhere around 500,000 @entity2 pieces in my collection			1
' the keyboard is fully functional and capable of performing to the same level as a normal keyboard			1
' it 's pretty part intensive , ' said mr @entity5 , a computer software developer who displays his @entity2 models under the name @entity48			1
the keyboard is fully functional and capable of performing to the same level as a normal keyboard ' most of the keys are built using nine pieces and there are over 100 keys			1
add a few hundred pieces for the frame and i would guess there are around 1,200 pieces in it			0
' mr @entity17 had to track down every single lettered tile to complete the keyboard , forcing him to get creative with a few symbols such as the colon , semi-colon and slashes			1
he said : ' i had most of the pieces already in my collection , so it did n't really cost me much to source the few extra parts i needed			0
' @entity2 is pretty expensive though , and i 'm sure sourcing all the parts from scratch would cost well over $ 100			0
' one of the main issues mr @entity17 encountered while constructing the keyboard was aligning the keys over the membrane , which he accomplished by using a system of @entity34 axles to precisely position the keys			1
time consuming : mr @entity17 had to track down every single lettered tile to complete the keyboard the second problem was even more difficult as a standard keyboard is screwed together in order to keep the interface , between the original circuit board and sensor membrane under pressure , causing @entity5 to use non-standard building techniques to replicate the same amount of pressure			1
after putting the project to one side for a number of years , due to frustrations with the angle of the keyboard , @entity5 revived the project earlier this year to the delight of @entity2 fans across the world			1
his @entity103 video highlighting the project has already become a hit , having been viewed around 750,000 times			0
however , to the dismay of many @entity2 fans , @entity5 has no plans to create any more @entity2 keyboards and it will only be for his personal use			2
' the feedback has been incredible			0
it seems a lot of people have really enjoyed seeing what is otherwise a pretty dull , everyday object rendered in more of a humorous and whimsical @entity2 form			0
i have had countless requests for instructions or to outright purchase it			0
' my goal , as i was building , was to produce more of a unique artistic piece rather than a kit or item to be sold			0
' what really drives me with this hobby is the problem solving aspect of building within the constraints of the @entity2 system			0
' now that the keyboard is complete i 'm much more interested in moving on to other projects than building more of them			0
