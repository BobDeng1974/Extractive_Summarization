the last time @entity2 took career advice from sir @entity4 , things did not work out quite so well			1
but that did not stop him seeking the opinion of his predecessor at @entity9 before accepting the invitation to become the new manager of @entity12 , as he revealed after his official unveiling in @entity14			1
it would suggest @entity2 harbours no grudge against @entity4 after his dismissal from @entity18 in april , or indeed after an updated version of @entity4 ’s autobiography was released last month			1
if some saw the new chapter as less than complimentary about @entity2 , the former @entity22 manager did not take offence once he was aware of the full context			1
@entity2 poses with a @entity12 scarf as he was unveiled as the club 's new manager on thursday @entity2 admits he took advice from sir @entity4 , as he did before taking over at @entity18 the new @entity12 boss was in high spirits as he oversaw his first training session in @entity14 there was not a hint of bitterness as he embarked on this new @entity38 adventure here on thursday			1
not only did he feel rejuvenated after a seven - month break but he felt vindicated too , such are the difficulties @entity42 has endured this season after amassing fewer points than @entity2 at the same stage last year			1
he was even generous towards his @entity47 successor , who he said should be given more time than he was			0
the conversation with @entity4 was nevertheless an interesting one			2
‘ i phoned sir @entity4 about coming out and he spoke about the job and the opportunity , which he thought was a great one for me , ’ he said			1
‘ he thought it would be a good chance and something very few @entity59 managers get the opportunity to do			0
’ very few @entity59 managers get the very top jobs in @entity64 football these days and the 10 - month spell he endured at @entity18 will always be a source of frustration			1
but appearing before the @entity38 media here at the @entity70 there was no shortage of confidence			0
he was relaxed and self - assured , delighted to be in @entity38 ’s wealthiest city even if his new boss happens to be in the arms business			1
@entity2 was greeted at his press conference unveiling with large welcoming backdrop the @entity78 took his first training session at the @entity81 training ground , where he met his new players @entity2 ( right ) alongside @entity12 president @entity83 ( left ) and director general @entity84 ‘ i feel that i have now got myself in a position where i ’m in a good frame of mind , ’ he said , smiling			1
i still stand by what i said at the time that i was not given enough time at @entity18 to succeed or fail			2
‘ i think there was nothing wrong with how we worked and everyone can see that whoever is in charge at @entity18 , it is quite a long job to do things			2
nine months would never be enough time for any manager			0
‘ i do think that most real football people understood that there would be a period of transition at @entity18 when you take over from sir @entity4			1
i always believed i was the right person for the job and i still believe that is the case			0
but @entity42 now has to be given the time to do the job			0
’ if that amounted to a bit of score - settling , his focus soon shifted to the opportunity he now has at ‘ @entity116 ’			0
@entity2 cut a different figure to the one seen at the end of his @entity9 tenure , smiling for the cameras the former @entity22 and @entity18 man ( far right ) addresses his new players at a training session @entity2 threw a scarf round his neck as he posed for photographs at the side of the @entity70 pitch he sat in the bar of his hotel on thursday night and spoke enthusiastically of the plans he has seen for the stadium refurbishment ; the fact that the pitch will be lowered to accommodate new seating that will fill the space currently occupied by a running track			1
and he revealed how he would be beginning @entity38 lessons on monday , determined to embrace the culture here as much as the challenge of managing in a league he considers superior to @entity64 football ’s top flight			0
as he said , @entity38 has the ‘ best players ’ and the clubs currently dominating @entity145 football			0
‘ look at the last @entity147 final , ’ he said			0
in the main press conference he was asked by a @entity38 journalist if he was ‘ more of a @entity150 or a @entity151 ’			0
he did not duck the question , the one - time @entity155 answering that he was more like the @entity156 because he ‘ works hard ’ and has a history at @entity22 of building successful teams			2
@entity2 was seen smiling as he made a phone call during the training session at @entity81 , @entity14 @entity2 follows in the footsteps of @entity162 ( left ) and @entity163 ( right ) at @entity12 the 51 - year - old is settling into his new environment , where he hopes he can bring success to the club they seem to like talk of @entity22 here			1
they regard themselves on a similar level and the league finishes @entity2 consistently achieved at @entity174 would be seen as success by the @entity176			2
their excitement here is almost tangible			0
they view @entity2 as quite a catch , ‘ a big international coach ’ , so much so that golfer @entity183 — a @entity176 himself — made the effort to join him for dinner with senior club officials			2
@entity2 seemed to like that , just as he was delighted to hear from his old friend @entity188 on thursday morning			2
‘ he welcomed me to @entity38 , ’ he said of the @entity190 manager			0
@entity2 ( right ) was all smiles as he met director general @entity84 prior to training the new boss watches his new team in a training session - he will be tasked with improving their fortunes @entity2 ( right ) next to club president @entity199 during his official unveiling in a press room at @entity70 ‘ i ’m looking forward to getting back out on the grass and working and coaching again , ’ he said			1
‘ this for me is a big challenge to come away and take on a big @entity38 club who are at the wrong end of the table and need to be pulled up			0
‘ it ’s probably my biggest challenge because it is a different country and you come here not actually knowing the players as directly as you might back home			0
