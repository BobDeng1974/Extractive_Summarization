by @entity1 reporter published : 10:35 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 4 september 2013 cheetahs have been found to use a mixture of stealth , speed and flexibility in a similar way to a race car overtaking			1
to catch prey , a cheetah is required to accelerate , make sharp stops and turn rapidly			2
race cars require similar tactics when overtaking or slowing down to negotiate a corner			1

animal type : carnivorous mammal length of body : 1.1 to 1.5m length of tail : 60 to 80 cm long weight : 21 – 72kg @entity25 : adapted to savannah or open grassland but also dense woodlands @entity29 : up to 17 years @entity30 of @entity31 ’s monitored speed , position and acceleration of six free - ranging cheetahs at @entity36 , southern @entity37			1
tracking was done using gps devices and movement monitors on collars placed on the cheetahs , according to @entity43 from @entity44			2
cheetahs , the world ’s fastest running land mammals , have powerful back legs and muscles that allow them to run as fast as 75 miles per hour			0
a long tail is used for balance and to help steering when making fast turns			0
the @entity31 study showed that , while cheetahs could easily outrun their prey , this is n’t the tactic they use			1
to catch prey , a cheetah is required to accelerate , make sharp stops and turn rapidly			0
race cars require similar tactics when overtaking or slowing down when going into corners			0
instead they have an initial burst of speed followed by a period where they make rapid turns as they close in on their prey			1
they then make a rapid stop as they pounce on their victim and devour their dinner			0
‘ predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against maneuvering capability in a race for survival , ’ said @entity30 of @entity31 ’s @entity76			1
the study also looked at greyhounds and race horses , and found that these animals placed more emphasis on acceleration that a cheetah			0
‘ much of a cheetah ’s pursuit thus appears less of a high - speed rush , and more of a carefully played out life - or - death duel between predator and prey , ’ said the researchers .			0

the *findings* were made by tracking six cheetahs in southern @entity37
