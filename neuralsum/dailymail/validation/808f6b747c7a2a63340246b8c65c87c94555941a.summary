twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full @entity2 every year for 24 years			1
to begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them			1
but the project did not stop there			1
this was a project that was to last 24 years , with each photographer progressing one hour every year , so that at the end of 24 years , there will be 24 sets of images from @entity2 - or 576 images			1
00.00 by @entity15 – untitled : ' i was in @entity17 and i was with friends in the square close to the main church			2
' to contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in ' a calm embrace and in their own magic space ' the original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at @entity30 in @entity31			1
six prints from this year 's project will be auctioned off in aid of @entity35 , an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family			1
curator @entity40 said : ' when i first heard about 24photography i thought what a great idea , i do hope they manage to keep the momentum going			2
now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each @entity50			1
their commitment to the project is inspiring			1
' @entity54 , founder of 24photography , said : ' the exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we 've really developed an identity and feel that we 're an established part of @entity31 's art calendar			1
@entity2 is an exciting time of the year , and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement , but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties			1
' 01:00 by @entity68 – superhero : ' this shot was taken in a cafe near a spooky industrial estate outside stockholm.this guy and his buddy were out skateboarding			2
he was waiting for a kebab , so was i ' 02:00 by @entity78 – untitled : @entity78 is fascinated with the human condition , how we relate to one another and our environment			0
his documentary work explores social issues such as mental health awareness and social exclusion 03:00 by @entity87 – off - centre … but this universe is for you : ' the photograph is of the last firework i had kept until my time slot had come			0
while taking the picture , i had think of someone who told me that i should n’t always have everything in the centre , so i took it off - centre ' 04:00 by @entity99 : ' my image was taken in @entity101 , @entity102 , in the old quarter			0
showing a young man , sleeping on his bike oblivious to the chaos around him ' 05:00 by @entity106 - dancing with the death : ' my picture was taken in my flat in @entity110 , back from a new year 's eve party			1
a little bit tired , i was wondering what i could shoot and discussing about that with my room - mate @entity117 , we had the idea to play with the science skeleton belonging to my wife @entity120			0
a lot of scenes were tried in an self - portrait mode and at a moment , i decided to dance with the skeleton			2
getting older , 2015 is for me the step to the age of fourty			0
dancing with the death is an ironic reference for me , as if i was daring the death ' 06:00 by @entity131 – celestial watcher guardian angel : ' every night this constellation stands above us			0
he watches from on high , what has he seen , heard ? powerless to help as mankind destroys the earth below ' 07:00 by @entity140 - the restless cries : ' hours earlier cheers and joyous voices welcomed a new year with @entity145 toasts and fireworks , the remnants of which line the banks of the river			2
billingsgate is silent now , but what crepuscular cries echo through the ages here ' 08:00 by @entity154 : ' my image was taken in @entity156 , around the @entity157 , near where i live			0
@entity50 is an experience , in this city , that is particularly colourful			0
there 's also a dark and mysterious energy about @entity156 : it bubbles at the surface of what you can see ... beyond the tourists			2
and part of why i love this city ' 09:00 by @entity169 – @entity173 : ' due to an unseasonably warm start to the winter , this delicate cherry blossom tree had flowered already			0
it caught my eye and i felt that it symbolised a good start to the @entity50 ' 10:00 by @entity178 – the house where @entity180 lived 11:00 by @entity181 – @entity183 @entity182 : ' @entity184 time in @entity183 is a good example of the ( often tacky ) mix between different cultures			0
even in 20 degrees , you can see @entity189 in the streets and @entity184 trees are everywhere , although they tend to be integrated in some @entity183 context and elements			0
picture has been taken in @entity195 , @entity102 , a city well known for its tailors and lanterns ' 12:00 by @entity198 – decade : ' ten years ago we were married on our farm in @entity201			1
@entity2 2015 , became a beautiful summer evening and the kids wanted to go for a walk up to @entity205 ' 13:00 by @entity206 – modern day hero : ' the " @entity213 " image was done during the new year 's parade on @entity215 and the " star " of the parade was this @entity219 camera attached to its telescopic cane / stick - a sort of prothesis extension on many arms / @entity209 were all over and are developing quickly			1
i know the @entity223 in @entity224 forbid them in the museum as they were so many of them and this started to cause problems ' 14:00 by @entity230 – i love you : ' @entity2 offers people the chance to consider changes as well as relax			1
i decided to go to @entity235 , in @entity236 , to gauge the mood			2
i expecteda sea of miserable people trudging around and being ripped off but , instead , saw a more cheery view of life – how simple and sometimes corny things ( fairground rides , soft toys , balloons and hotdogs ) can entertain and genuinely lift the mood ' 15:00 by @entity248 – on the edge 16:00 by @entity250 – untitled : ' connected			0
every day ' 17:00 by @entity251 – alone : ' @entity2 is a busy time , the sales are on in @entity254 and the area is packed with people			1
despite this there is still plenty of opportunity for people to be isolated			0
new technology can make thismore bearable , whilst at the same time making it more likely ' 18:00 by @entity263 - @entity262 : my image : ' @entity262 , was taken in @entity266 ( @entity267 )			0
for me it sums up how many of us feel on @entity2 ; tired , aching , and more than a little green around the gills ' 19:00 by @entity272 : ' i took this photo in response to the anti-immigrant rhetoric increasinglynoticeable in the @entity276 and @entity277 recently			1
at first it seemed @entity279 were the target ; but the @entity282 atrocity took things to a new level ; it became a blame game ; blame the immigrants , blame @entity287 , blame the @entity288 , blame somebody , for something			0
to my mind inclusiveness and diversity are things to be celebrated , not demonised ' 20:00 by @entity294 – quietways and superhighways : ' this picture was taken crossing @entity298 on the way back from seeing friends … the day after the night before			2
the park felt quiet compared to usual , but it struck me that there is always a hum in @entity31 and the constant signs of people interacting , no matter what day of the year ' 21:00 by @entity54 - untitled : ' my image is intended to portray the innocence of childhood as well as capturing the fashion of the time - the @entity310 ' 22:00 by @entity311 of @entity312 : @entity311 is an artist teacher living and working in @entity313			1
his photograph was taken at 22:00 in south @entity31 whilst visiting friends			1
the image shows the inside of a bag of his daughter 's loom bands , their bright colours and huge numbers have been a major feature both at home and away and will continue to be into 2015 23:00 by @entity326 – all was homely in @entity327 : ' here 's what we 're used to breathing			2
little by little we learn not to see and not to @entity332 means laughing gas : it causes euphoria or confusion			0
the anesthetic effect of nitrous oxide is not well - documented in detail , but it is thought that it interacts with the brain by altering intercellular communication at synapses			0
it is classified as a soft drug			0
