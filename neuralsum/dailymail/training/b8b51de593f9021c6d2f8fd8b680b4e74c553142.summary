a senior @entity45 source said it was vital to dispel myths perpetuated by radical @entity20 and far right organisations such as the @entity6 that ‘ the @entity49 is at war with @entity20 ’			2
‘ this is an opportunity for men and women in uniform today – muslim and @entity56 – to go into schools and show that people of all faiths are serving alongside each in our army forces ’ , the source said			0
