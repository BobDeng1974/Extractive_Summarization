a 300 - year - old burial area , in which two bodies were reduced to skeletons while one was perfectly preserved , has left @entity5 archaeologists baffled			1
when one of the coffins was opened , the man 's face , experts claim , was perfectly preserved			1
within hours , however , the face started to go black , and a foul smell began to emanate from the body			1
baffled @entity5 archaeologists are studying a 300 year - old coffin found with two others in which two of the bodies had been reduced to skeletons , but in which the third was almost perfectly preserved clothes on the body of the 300 - year - old @entity5 corpse indicate he was a very senior official from the early @entity27			1
the @entity27 , which lasted from 1644 to 1912 , followed the @entity28 and was the last imperial dynasty of @entity5 before the creation of the @entity31			1
under the @entity27 territory , the empire grew to three times its size			2
the population increased from around 150 million to 450 million			0
the present - day boundaries of @entity5 are largely based on the territory controlled by the @entity27 the skin on the corpse - which has now been taken to the local university for study - also turned black			1
the body is thought to be from the @entity27			1
it was unearthed on october 10 on a construction site in a two metre - deep hole in the ground at @entity47 in @entity49 province , central @entity5			0
dr @entity50 , a specialist in @entity5 art and archaeology at @entity53 , told @entity54 that preservations such as these were not intentional			0
' the @entity5 did not do any treatment of the body to preserve it as known from ancient @entity59 , for instance			2
' they did , however , try to protect the body by putting it into massive coffins and stable tomb chambers			2
' so the integrity of the physical structure of the body was important to them			0
in early @entity5 , at least , one expected the dead person to live on in the tomb			0
' occasionally bodies in the @entity27 were preserved by the natural conditions around the coffin			1
in this case , the body may have had a lacquered coffin , covered in charcoal - which was common at the time			0
this means bacteria would have been unable to get in			0
dr @entity50 added that if this was the case , as soon as air hit the body , the natural process would be for it to turn black and quickly disintegrate			1

professor @entity97 proposes an alternative theory for the preservation			0
' it â€™s possible the man 's family used some materials to preserve the body , ' he said			2
' once it was opened the natural process of decay could really start			0
' ' we are working hard though to save what there is			0

what is amazing is the way time seems to be catching up on the corpse , ageing hundreds of years in a day ' the 700 - year - old mummy was found in the city of @entity135 , in @entity136 in 2011 the @entity27 , and the preceding @entity28 , are known for their well - preserved corpses			1
