a fortnight ago , @entity0 chipped two vertebrae			1
now he looks set to play at @entity2			1
the @entity3 ( 6 - 3 ) are desperate to arrest a two - game losing streak and will risk their divisive quarterback against the @entity6			1
the 34 - year - old , equally famed for thrilling fourth - quarter comebacks as he is for disastrous interceptions , has been told in no uncertain terms that he will return at the expense of back - up @entity12			2
@entity15 owner @entity14 made that clear before leaving for @entity16 , while at @entity19 ’ @entity17 on friday head coach @entity18 said : ‘ he looked pretty comfortable to me			2
’ @entity0 speaks to fans during the @entity23 fan rally at @entity2 ahead of the 11th @entity25 game a heavily padded @entity0 throws during training on friday with the @entity3 quarterback expected to play @entity0 has a history of playing through the pain , and in 2011 managed to do so against the @entity30 with a punctured lung and a broken rib			1
he won the game , too			0
but the injury is a notoriously painful one			0
@entity0 will be heavily padded and will struggle with mobility if he does suit up , the @entity3 wo n’t want him to get hit , so expect their vaunted offensive line and the @entity23 ’s leading rusher , @entity39 to protect him			1
@entity39 became the first player to rush for 100 yards in each of the first seven games of the season			2
the bruising running back has 1,133 yards from 225 carries , and with the rejuvenating bye week to come , can expect a greater workload against a weak @entity6 run defense			1
@entity0 has thrown a touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games and @entity50 will want to get back into form after a quiet few weeks			1
@entity39 leads the @entity23 in rushing yards and should feature heavily against the @entity6 @entity50 will hope to wow the crowd with the wideout looking to return to form after two quiet games the acrobatic wide receiver said he has ‘ a little bit of extra juice ’ since landing in @entity16 , so get set for fireworks as the @entity3 aim to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2009			1
meanwhile , are the @entity6 as bad as their 1 - 8 record suggests ? in a word , yes			2
the @entity23 ’s youngest team , they possess an admirable head coach in the shape of @entity69			0
but they will need to address points conceded ( 27.9 ) and yards per game ( 386.9 ) to trouble the @entity75 column			0
they are good at hassling the quarterback , however			0
and with 27 sacks - joint third in the @entity23 - their front seven are capable of making life difficult for @entity0			2
in @entity85 , the third overall pick of this year ’s draft , they have a rookie quarterback who has drawn comparisons with @entity88			0
but he is prone to errors of judgement and leads the @entity23 in interceptions with 13			0
@entity85 has made some rookie mistakes this season , but he is being backed to turn it around long - term @entity95 has been a quarterback , wide receiver and a cornerback before settling as a running back @entity85 has some exciting weapons in the shape of @entity101 and undrafted rookie @entity102 , who hauled in seven passes for 117 yards , scoring two touchdowns in last week ’s 22 - 23 defeat to the @entity106			0
and then there ’s running back @entity95 , so called because he does n’t tie them up			0
he will spearhead the ground game after averaging over 100 yards for the past three matches			0
on paper , the @entity3 win			1
but on @entity2 ’s hybrid grass , will the @entity6 make the @entity3 regret their decision to risk @entity0 ?			1

@entity0 suffered two chipped vertebrae but is set to take the *snaps* at @entity2
both the @entity3 and the @entity6 have lost their last two games , with @entity119 needing a win to keep the *pressure* on @entity123 rivals
@entity0 was *awarded* a new deal in *summer* and is expected to play through the pain
the teams will wear *poppies* on the *helmets* and *jerseys* on @entity132
