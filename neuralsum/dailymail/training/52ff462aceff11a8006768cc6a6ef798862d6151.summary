defence secretary @entity2 became the first senior government figure to admit that @entity4 could be asked to return to the issue after they stunned @entity15 last week by refusing to support even the principle of a strike on @entity18			1
mr @entity15 and deputy prime minister @entity19 have insisted there is no prospect of a second vote after @entity23 made its will clear			1
but senior @entity24 , including former cabinet ministers @entity25 and @entity27 , @entity29 mayor @entity28 and former leader @entity30 , insisted it was vital not to rule out another vote			1
an @entity34 poll for the @entity35 found 71 per cent of people think mps were right to reject military action , and that mr @entity15 handled the issue better than @entity41 leader @entity40			1
but @entity43 chief @entity42 and @entity45 president @entity44 accuse @entity10 tyrant @entity46 of using chemical weapons on civilians			2
however , @entity46 said @entity10 would hit back if it was attacked by @entity45 , adding : ‘ there will be repercussions , negative ones obviously , on @entity45 interests			0
’ he also raised the threat of a ‘ regional war ’ if the @entity54 launched strikes , telling @entity45 newspaper @entity56 : ‘ @entity57 is a powder keg , and today the spark is getting closer			0
‘ one must not talk only about the @entity10 response , but also about what could happen after the first strike			0
' no one can know what will happen			0
everyone will lose control of the situation once the powder keg explodes			0
chaos and extremism will spread			0
the risk exists of a regional war			0
’ threats : @entity46 said @entity10 would hit back if it was attacked by @entity45 adding there would be repercussions mr @entity2 admitted last night that a second @entity78 vote could take place if circumstances changed ‘ very significantly ’			1
amid growing signs of @entity41 disarray over the stance taken last week by @entity40 – who is accused of indicating support for the government only to pull the plug at the last minute – shadow cabinet ministers @entity88 and @entity89 suggested a second vote may be needed			2
defence spokesman mr @entity88 said he was ‘ uneasy ’ at the stance of ‘ indefinite inaction ’ left by thursday ’s defeat at the hand of @entity41 and 30 @entity7 rebels			2
he added : ‘ an attack on an ally by @entity46 or further chemical atrocities would give the prime minister a right to bring this back to @entity23			0
’ business spokesman mr @entity89 said : ‘ we certainly did n’t rule out military action			2
’ former @entity41 culture secretary @entity103 said it was ‘ nonsense ’ for ministers to rule out military intervention in @entity10 in all circumstances , and @entity108 , another former cabinet minister , said there should ‘ of course ’ be a second vote on @entity10 ‘ if circumstances change ’			1
however , @entity7 sources said there was no prospect of a second vote because mr @entity15 would have little option but to resign if he was defeated again on a matter of war .			1
