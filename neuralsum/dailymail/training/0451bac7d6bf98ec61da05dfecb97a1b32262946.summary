@entity0 crashed out of the @entity1 on friday , but manager @entity2 has remarkably been assured that his job is safe until the 2016 @entity4			1
despite @entity8 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity9 sealing @entity0 ’s embarrassingly early exit in @entity11 , @entity6 chairman @entity5 insisted that @entity2 is the right man to lead the country			1
when asked if @entity2 — whose earnings of £ 3.5million a year make him the second highest - paid manager at the @entity1 — would remain in his job until the end of his contract in 2016 , @entity5 said : ‘ that is the view of myself , of everybody else here in @entity11 and of others in the @entity6			1
@entity2 has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the @entity4			1
we do not see any value in changing			2
’ @entity0 have lost 2 - 1 to both @entity9 and @entity30 in @entity11 , failing to qualify from the group stage for the first time since @entity33 in 1958 , but @entity5 said : ‘ everybody thought we played really well in the first game against @entity9 and narrowly lost			1
in the second game it could have gone either way			2
they were narrow defeats , but it is for the football people , not for me , to identify why we did not win			2
’ @entity5 has targeted victory at the @entity42			1
when asked if that target was attainable , he said : ‘ yes , but it means lots of changes in @entity48 football			2
there is a real chance that we can develop and win in 2022			2
’ @entity2 himself admitted he and the team had let the nation down			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve failed			2
we had really big hopes we were going to make the nation proud by going far in the tournament and we have n’t done that			2
so any words are pretty empty at the moment			0
dejected : @entity0 were knocked out of the @entity1 in dismal fashion in a tough @entity61 ‘ i ’m very low			1
we had high hopes , we thought we could make an impact			0
but unfortunately we have n’t won the games			0
’ it is the first time @entity0 — who bow out of the tournament against surprise @entity61 leaders @entity8 in @entity72 on tuesday — have lost their first two games at a @entity1 finals			1
but @entity2 added : ‘ i believe the team going forward will be a very good team			1
i think there are good young players			0
even against @entity30 we saw some good individual performances and the young ones that came on did quite well			1
‘ but results colour everything			0
we played a very tough - tackling and strong defensive @entity83 team			0
i do n’t think there ’s any need to have any doubts this group of players will go on to do good things in the time ahead			0
‘ i think the team are evolving			0
i ’m proud of the way they ’ve approached this tournament and everything they put into it			0
at the moment i ’m just devastated they got nothing out of it			0
’ goalkeeper @entity99 claimed @entity2 has the backing of the @entity0 dressing room			1
he said : ‘ we are proud to play for @entity2			1
he ’s a great manager , he ’s a very passionate man and someone that i ’ve got an awful lot of respect for and i hope to continue playing for			0
’ asked if he thought the team had progressed in two years since @entity2 took control from @entity108 , @entity99 replied : ‘ saying yes sounds like a stupid thing to say , but i do			1
‘ we ’ve got bags of quality , bags of people coming through , great leaders and great experienced players and we ’ve just come up short in two games			0
i ’d imagine some people will say we ’re simply not good enough but we do n’t feel that inside the camp			0
‘ it ’s hard to take but we ’re at a @entity1 and if you do n’t get results then this happens			1
we ’ve committed our lives to this tournament and we ’ll continue to do that until the end of the group stage , whatever happens			2
’ sir @entity128 , the @entity6 director of football development who is retiring after the tournament , believes @entity0 can win the @entity1 in @entity130 in 2018 or the @entity4 two years later			1
‘ it will be an exciting time in the next four to six years in @entity48 football , ’ said @entity128			0
‘ i think 2018 , 2020 is the time when quite a few of our younger players will have lots of good experience			0
‘ @entity2 has done really well to include some of those in this tournament			2
just the fact he has had five or six weeks to work with them will augur well going forward			0
‘ there is a really good young nucleus in the squad			0
