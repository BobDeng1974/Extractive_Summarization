by @entity0 when three - year - old @entity2 was rushed to hospital with a burst appendix , doctors did n't think he could survive the surgery needed to save him			1
however , not only did the little boy from @entity8 , @entity9 , make an astonishingly speedy recovery , he claimed that while surgeons were fighting to keep him alive , he visited heaven , sat on @entity14 's lap and patted his rainbow - striped horse			1
it 's a remarkable story and one that has taken the @entity19 box - office by storm this @entity21 , raking in $ 22.5million ( £ 13.4million ) in its opening weekend and nearly $ 52million ( £ 31million ) overall so far			1
the boy , who is now 14 , told of how he rose out of his body on the surgical table and saw his father cursing @entity48 and his mother weeping - which is what they claim they were doing at the time			1
he also says he met his great - grandfather and his sister , who was lost in a miscarriage a year before he was born - both people his parents say they have never mentioned to him			2
@entity30 , pictured aged 11 , talks to terminally ill children via @entity61 to comfort them while in heaven , @entity30 says he met a blue - eyed , brown - haired @entity14 , chatted with @entity63 and saw the @entity64 praying at @entity48 's throne , all the time serenaded by a choir of angels singing @entity14 loves you			1
@entity30 , who is now a high - school wrestling star and promising musician , uses his experiences to comfort terminally ill children and their families , talking with them via @entity61			2
he said : ' it helps the kids realise , " hey , i do n’t have to deal with all this pain ... i got something better waiting for me			2
" ' it also helps the family			2
it reassures them because if you go to heaven you ’re going to have the time of your life			2
' i ’m not scared of dying because i know where i ’m going			0
' critics have dismissed @entity30 's claims , some even suggesting they are being exaggerated to drive sales of his father 's book , also called @entity92			1
@entity94 author @entity93 wrote in the @entity95 : ' only in @entity19 could this book be classified as non-fiction			0
' at age four , an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality is charming			0
but among @entity19 adults , widespread identification with the mind of a ­ pre-schooler is scary			0
' even the director of the film , which opens in the @entity114 on may 9 , @entity106 - who made his name as a writer for movies like @entity110 and @entity111 - said : ' it was crucial i had doubts about @entity30 ’s story			1
' if someone is trying to convince me of a dogma , i ’m not interested			0
' but if someone is recounting an ­ authentic experience , i ’m fascinated			0
' @entity30 , right , with ( @entity124 ) mother @entity37 , sister @entity123 , brother @entity125 and father @entity29 at the film 's world premiere @entity30 's parents @entity29 and @entity37 are played in the film by @entity34 , left , and @entity38 , right however , even a decade on , mr @entity130 is adamantly standing by his son 's visions			1
he said : ' there ’s no medical explanation for all this – there is only a heavenly one			0
' we seem to avoid talking about things like life and death until we are confronted with them , like at a funeral			0
' but it can be comforting to know there is more out there			0
