‘ it was horrible , ’ she said			0
‘ it felt like no - one cared about us			0
‘ @entity14 was born after an emergency caesarean section and weighed just 1lbs 9oz			2
i do n’t ever want another woman to have to go through what i did			0
’ ms @entity6 ’ brother called 999 when she started bleeding heavily while staying with her father on november 1			1
she started bleeding because her placenta had ruptured			1
ms @entity6 was eventually admitted to @entity16 after being told @entity7 and @entity10 women 's hospitals were too full			1
@entity14 was delivered by @entity46 but died soon afterwards she claims paramedics spent precious moments calling hospitals in a bid to find a place for her to deliver @entity14			1
a spokesman for @entity53 said : ‘ being a visitor from @entity27 , the patient was not booked into a maternity unit in @entity10 to have the birth			0
‘ as such , and to avoid the possibility of having to make a subsequent hospital transfer , the ambulance crew rang round local hospitals to establish who was able to accept her			0
‘ the situation was being explained to the patient while the ambulance crews were making the enquiries with hospitals			0
@entity69 says it 's surprised ms @entity6 was told by paramedics that she could not be taken there ‘ the first hospital to accept was @entity16 and she was taken there straight away			1

she said : ‘ we are very sorry to hear of @entity88 ’ traumatic experience and extend our sympathies for her loss			0
‘ we would like to reassure the public that @entity81 would never turn away an emergency patient because she was n’t from the area and , indeed , we accept emergencies on a regular basis			0
ms @entity6 says she hopes no other woman ever has to go through what she experienced ‘ the only reasons we would decline such an admission would be if we did not have the capacity to take a woman or her baby , and to do so would be clinically unsafe			0
‘ on this particular evening we could not offer the neonatal intensive care cot which @entity14 would have needed , as all of our 39 cots were full			2
‘ the cross-city policy is for such emergencies to be referred to the unit with the specialist resources available			0

' @entity131 is part of the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , and has a level 1 unit at @entity69 and a level 3 unit at @entity136			0

i would urge ms @entity6 to get in touch with us directly so we can investigate her concerns			0
