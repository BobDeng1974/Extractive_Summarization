@entity0 yesterday attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ‘ above the parapet ’ and stick up for the free market			1
the chancellor said that for the first time since the fall of the @entity14 , the principles of enterprise and business as a force for widespread prosperity were ‘ up for grabs ’			1
speaking to business leaders at the @entity18 ’ annual convention , he called on firms to counter an anti-free market movement led by trade unions and some charities			1
@entity0 attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ‘ above the parapet ’ and stick up for the free market ‘ you have to get out there and put the business argument , ’ he said			1
‘ because there are plenty of pressure groups , plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities and the like , that will put the counter view			1
‘ it is , i know , a difficult decision sometimes to put your head above the parapet , but that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprising , business , low - tax economy that delivers prosperity for the people and generations to come			2
‘ there is a big argument in our country about our future , about whether we are a country that is for business , for enterprise , for the free market			2
‘ for the first time since my adult life , that is up for grabs			0
that issue felt it had been resolved when the @entity14 fell			0
@entity63 general secretary @entity62 said @entity0 was agreeing with @entity65 's ' enemy within ' rhetoric ‘ politicians like @entity68 form the left felt like they had understood that free markets create the taxes to fund public services and the like			2
‘ that argument has gone and you saw it with the very stark contrast between the two political conferences in the last two weeks , so i would urge the business community not to sit on the sidelines of the political debate that is going to happen over the next seven months			0
‘ it does n’t mean you have to endorse a party , a party like the @entity85 , but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument … that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise , business low - tax economy which deliver prosperity for generations to come			0
’ the general secretary of the @entity63 , @entity62 , said : ‘ the chancellor accuses unions of being anti-business , yet many of @entity99 ’s most successful companies and sectors – such as carmakers – depend on the labour and skills of trade unionists just as much as their managers			1
' he has let down his guard to show how much he agrees with @entity65 ’s ‘ enemy within ’ rhetoric			0
‘ but the real issue today is that the chancellor is doing nothing to fairly share the benefits of recovery			0
' he has rewarded soaraway executive pay with tax cuts for the super-rich , but been happy to see the longest and deepest cut in living standards for everyone else , only this week announcing cuts in the benefits that low - paid workers desperately need when the real value of their pay is falling			0
