@entity7 , 25 , was just shy of 15st and dreaded going to the park with her little girl @entity9			1
she suffered from asthma and would be left exhausted by the mildest activity			1
but she was shocked when her daughter bluntly told one day last spring : ' you 're too wobbly , mummy - you eat far too much			1
' transformed : @entity7 before she decided to tackle her figure ( left ) and on the last day of her bootcamp ( right ) today : @entity7 now cuts a far trimmer figure in the playground with her daughter @entity9 it was the stark wake - up call she needed			1
she decided to spend her savings and a recent inheritance on an eight - week stay at a weight - loss boot camp			2
after dropping her daughter off with relatives , she headed to the @entity28 in @entity29 , where a gruelling diet and fitness regime meant she was losing 1lb a day			1
a typical day consisted of circuit training , spinning , boxing and a hikes of up to six miles			2
the camp specialises in military physical training with former @entity38 as fitness instructors			2
she tucked into a diet that added up to 1,000 - 1,200 calories a day , with meals such as caluflower soup and salmon with @entity47 vegetables			2
in less than two months , ms @entity7 had lost almost three stone – going down from 14st 9lb to her current weight of 11st 11lb			1
her dress size went from a bulky 16 to a far more shapely 12			1
she had shaved inches all her problem areas , with her waist measurement dropping from 37 " to 34 " and her hips slimming down from 41.5 " to 37 "			2
@entity7 with her daughter @entity9 , whose brutal honesty forced her to take stock of her health the punishing bootcamp was designed by former @entity38 but @entity7 ( right ) loved it toning up : @entity7 after one week at the bootcamp ( left ) and after several weeks of intensive workouts ( right ) after leaving the camp , which cost £ 3,500 , she found she could play in the park with her daughter without getting tired			1
' i was like a completely new woman , ' she said			2
' but the most satisfying thing for me was seeing @entity9 ’s reaction			0
she told me : " @entity72 , you are beautiful – your fat tummy has gone			0
" the single mother , who is studying for a degree in public sector management in @entity77 , piled on the pounds over many years			0
she said : ' i did n’t particularly eat unhealthily , i just ate too much			0
i was eating for four people			0
and my weight just kept on going up and up			0
' i hated what i was doing to myself , but whatever i tried i could n’t seem to shift it			0
' she tried various popular diets and slimming clubs but found none of them worked for her			1
she said : ' i was suffering quite badly from depression and my obesity was so bad that they were talking about my having a gastric band operation			1
' i wanted to have one last chance at losing the weight naturally and that is why i checked in to no 1 @entity28			0
i wanted to see if you could change your life through hard work , dedication and eating the right things			0
' @entity7 spent most of last summer at the exclusive weight loss camp in @entity29 she said : ' it really suited me			1
i had booked in initially for six weeks but enjoyed it so much i booked for an extra two weeks			0
' it did n’t just help me to lose the weight – i was able to change my whole lifestyle			0
overweight : @entity7 said she did n't eat unhealthy food but she simply ate too much ' it introduced me to a whole new way of eating which meant that i did n’t return to the bad habits of old			1
my asthma is cured and i no longer suffer from depression			1
' and i was finally able to achieve a level of fitness which meant that not only could play for as long as i liked in the park with @entity9 but i wanted to carry on exercising after i had left the camp			0
' her weight has remained stable since checking out of the boot camp last september			0
' that is the ultimate tribute , ' she said			0
' with other diets , i would quickly go back to the bad old habits but this has brought about a permanent change			2
' @entity9 loves the new me			0
