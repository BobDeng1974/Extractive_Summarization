sergeant @entity0 , the enlisted @entity1 soldier who left his post in @entity3 in 2009 and was later ransomed from an @entity5 extremist network by the @entity7 administration for five @entity9 leaders , was charged with desertion and ' misbehavior before the enemy ' buy the @entity13 on wednesday			1
but he wo n't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of ' @entity16 to @entity17 or @entity18			0
' the level of that charge the @entity21 levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term			1
the other charge , however , ' @entity25 , ' could send him to a military prison for life			2
the @entity29 describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy			1
an @entity13 spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at @entity51 in @entity52 that the next step in the procedure would be an ' article 32 ' hearing at @entity91 in @entity92			1
that 's where @entity0 remains on active duty , and will remain unless he 's convicted			0
an article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system			0
its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial			0
@entity0 , 28 , disappeared from his post in @entity105 , @entity3 on june 30 , 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about @entity1 's mission there			1
the @entity108 , a @entity110 - based network of islamists aligned with the @entity9 regime , took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years			1
a deal brokered by the @entity116 nation of @entity117 brought him home , but at the cost of releasing the @entity9 insurgents from the military prison complex at @entity121 , @entity122			1
two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the @entity126 when their @entity117 - imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over			0
a government official meanwhile told @entity130 that three of the men have already tried to 're - engage ' with their old networks , and one was ' trying to provide advice , council or inspiration ' to his former terror network			1
@entity0 will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the @entity29 ' desertion with @entity142 to @entity17 or @entity18 ' : @entity143 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service			2
' it can carry a death sentence but the military wo n't seek that option in the @entity0 case @entity158 : 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' @entity25 ' : article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy			1
' @entity158 : life in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay the @entity21 was set to announce a decision in the case wednesday afternoon at @entity51 , @entity52 , but the @entity188 insisted it was in the dark			1
' i 'm not aware of any plans for them to do that , ' @entity188 press secretary @entity190 said during his daily press briefing , after @entity195 asked him for comment on the looming @entity21 press conference			0
' but this is a process that 's being run by the @entity13 , ' @entity190 added			0
' so i 'd direct you to the @entity21 for an answer			0
' a @entity21 official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement			1
house speaker @entity206 , an @entity208 @entity207 , said in a statement after the @entity13 's announcement that ' every @entity1 is innocent until proven guilty , and we all wanted to bring sgt. @entity0 home			1
' ' but my chief concern remains president @entity7 ’s decision to release five hardened terrorists , with no guarantees that they wo n’t return to the battlefield			2
i believe it made @entity1 less safe			0
' @entity0 's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy , but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180 - degree turn			2
last year after @entity0 came home , national security adviser @entity228 claimed he had served his country ' with honor and distinction			2
' but in the days before his then - mysterious disappearance in 2009 , he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts			2
' the future is too good to waste on lies			0
and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong , ' he wrote , according to @entity246 magazine			0
' i have seen their ideas and i am ashamed to even be @entity1			2
' @entity0 's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read : ' obey your conscience ! ' the @entity130 reported in 2014 that @entity0 's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life – and that he intended to renounce his citizenship			1
' @entity260 ' : the terror leaders traded for @entity0 were ( top , from left ) : @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 ; and ( bottom from left ) : @entity268 , mullah @entity269 @entity270 : @entity0 's captors released a video on july 19 , 2009 showing him with his head shaven , and showing his military ' dog tag ' @entity275 to the camera gen. @entity278 , the commanding officer at @entity51 , has been leading the inquest into the @entity0 case			1
the @entity13 's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove @entity0 never intended to return to his combat unit			2
desertion itself can carry a death sentence , but only in the most serious of cases			0
that penalty has n't been levied on a @entity1 servicemember since 1944			0
the @entity21 has broad discretion and can charge soldiers , sailors , @entity294 and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels			2
@entity0 's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the @entity21 's announcement			1
the @entity303 reported that @entity304 , @entity0 's attorney , said his client was handed his ' charge sheet ' wednesday at @entity51			1
president @entity7 attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced , especially from @entity0 's former platoonmates – who insisted he deserted them and their mission			2
one of them , @entity314 , told a congressional committee in june 2014 that @entity0 could – and should – be court martialed on eight separate charges , including disobeying orders and ' misconduct ' as a prisoner			0
ballet @entity321 : @entity0 was a classical dancer from the age of 16 or 17 , studying at the @entity323 before he enlisted in the @entity13 @entity324 : the @entity13 opened an investigation into @entity0 's ' capture ' almost immediately after his release , shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange ( @entity0 is 3rd right , back to the camera ) temporary : jubilant signs and @entity1 flags went up overnight in the @entity336 ' hometown of @entity337 , @entity275 – but were largely taken down as the circumstances of @entity0 's capture made the news			1
most of the backlash against the president , however , came from @entity344 – which was n't given 30 days ' notice about the ' @entity9 5 ' being transferred out of @entity347			0
a federal law requires such notice			0
the @entity350 later approved a resolution condemning @entity7 for breaking the law , with 22 @entity353 breaking ranks to agree			0
' by setting free five top @entity9 commanders from @entity1 custody , the @entity7 administration made @entity1 less safe , ' speaker @entity206 said then			1
@entity7 defended his actions in a june 2014 joint press conference in @entity360 , @entity361 with @entity363 prime minister @entity362 , just a few days after @entity0 was released into @entity1 custody			1
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents , ' the president said then , ' and that the @entity1 people understand that this is somebody 's child and that we do n't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back			0
' ' we had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated , and we were deeply concerned about [ him ] , ' @entity7 told reporters about sgt. @entity0			2
' and we saw an opportunity and we seized it			0
and i make no apologies for that			0
' administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the @entity9 threatened to kill @entity0 if information about the negotiations was leaked			1
separately , the parents of an @entity13 lietenant who died while searching for @entity0 months after he walked away from his platoon told @entity195 that the @entity21 ' lied ' to them about the circumstances of their son 's death			1
second lieutenant @entity394 perished in september 2009 , and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a @entity9 commander			0
once @entity0 was released , they were told the truth			0
' it 's a big cover - up like @entity400 , ' @entity394 ' father said three days after @entity0 's release , ' just like everything @entity7 has done			1

' misbehavior before the enemy ' charge could result in life in prison but @entity21 chose a lower level of desertion that carries just 5 years
brief announcement at @entity51 , @entity52 on wednesday confirmed that a *preliminary* hearing will take place at @entity51 @entity91 in @entity92
