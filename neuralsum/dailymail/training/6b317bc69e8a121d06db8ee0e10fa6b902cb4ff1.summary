it 's a manoeuvre that 'll wedge your heart in your mouth , tie your stomach in knots and wrench at the gut			0
but it 's all in a day 's work for daredevil @entity9 who has perfected a signature trick which sees him fly upside down directly above other planes while travelling at more than 150mph			1
once in that position he can fly with what seems like barely a few feet between the two planes ' cockpits as he barrels over the pilot below , zooming into dramatic aerial photographs			1
top to bottom : @entity9 ( top ) barrels over @entity22 ( bottom ) in @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 no room for error : @entity9 flies a @entity30 - @entity29 perilously close to a @entity31 in @entity32 on a high : @entity9 ( @entity30 - rh ) and @entity34 ( @entity35 - 5 ) soar in the sky while being snapped by a photographer the split second roll over is reminiscent of @entity41 film @entity39 and @entity9 has managed the stunt in jets and other nimble aircraft such as his custom , all - carbon fibre competition aerobatic plane , known as an @entity29			1
@entity9 , from @entity47 , in @entity48 , @entity49 , flew in his first air show in 2002 and has notched up more than 10,000 hours of flight experience			1
stomach churning : @entity9 ( second from top ) glides through the skies upside down golden boy : @entity9 has been crowned @entity57 and @entity58 do n't look down ! the daredevil pilot flies upside down above a @entity60 in an already illustrious , @entity63 - worthy career trajectory , the 40 - year - old pilot has been crowned @entity57 four times and @entity58 twice			1
he said : ' the whole manoeuvre is all about trust and experience			0
i pick only experienced pilots i trust to fly with and then we all fly exactly as we plan			0
' we brief what we fly and fly what we brief			0
i fly off the photo plane the whole time			1
once i roll upside down , i try to stay as level and smooth as i can			2
it takes years of experience flying in formation to perform manoeuvres like this safely			2
' but it 's a lot of fun and also an honour to share the sky with so many incredible planes and pilots			0
in the end , i hope the images serve to inspire other people to pursue their dreams			0
' i never fear - if i was afraid , i would n't do it			2
i do n't fear this kind of flying , but i respect it			0
@entity9 ( @entity29 ) performs one of his signature manoeuvres - while photobombing @entity94 ( @entity95 ) @entity96 , @entity32 ) soaring to new heights ! @entity9 ( @entity30 - rh ) and lcdr @entity98 ( no 5 ) take part in the extreme photo shoot cruise who ? the pilot has notched up more than 10,000 hours flight time and says it takes years of experience flying in formation to perform manoeuvres like this safely all in a day 's work : @entity63 in @entity41 hit film @entity39 which features crazy stunts aerobatic stunts ' by having respect for the dangers inherent in flying , you can manage and minimise the risk			1
you want these manoeuvres to look dangerous , but actually be safe			0
' it takes a similarly high level of skill for photographer @entity124 , 44 , who has been photographing the pilot for two years , to capture the vital moment			1
@entity127 , from @entity128 , @entity129 , said : ' the most difficult aspect of capturing these shots is working to get sharp images from a platform - an aeroplane - constantly in motion			2
@entity9 ( top ) flying alongside two @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 in one of his signature tricks the daredevil says he does't fear this type of flying , he ' respects it ' , and wants his manoeuvres to be safe ' you want to use slow shutter speeds so the aircraft propellers are blurred , but that makes it harder to get the planes themselves sharp , especially when the air is rough			1
' while these may appear to be stunts they really are carefully coordinated manoeuvres executed by highly trained aviators with years of experience			2
' and , of course , sharing the sky with my heroes never gets old			0
' i 'm glad to be able to share the experiences with everyone through these photos			0
