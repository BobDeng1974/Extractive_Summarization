for most politicians , image is everything			0
not a hair out of place , no grimace or gurning caught on camera , each public appearance carefully stage managed			0
unless , of course , you are @entity10 , who today added to his bulging photo album of absurd pr stunts strutting his stuff with @entity15 star @entity14 and a group of @entity17			1
and yet for @entity10 , it seems , there is no dance routine too ridiculous , no uniform too ill - fitting , no sport too demanding and , famously , no zip - wire too high for the wannabe @entity49 leader to turn to his advantage			2
to mark @entity53 's final appearance hosting @entity54 , @entity10 took him for a ride on a tandem around @entity57 and outed the presenter as ' the last one - nation @entity49 working at the @entity59 ' i 'll be bike : @entity10 persuaded @entity62 star @entity61 to mount a @entity63 during a photocall in @entity57 in march 2011 the political heavyweight appeared piled on the pounds when taking part in the @entity67 in august last year , although aides blamed an unflattering billowing t - shirt to get away from the heat of the political battle , he experienced a real ' firehouse ' at the @entity74 's new training facility in @entity75 in june this year never one to shy away from using a sledgehammer to crack a nut , the @entity57 mayor offered some muscle to help with improvements to a new square at @entity83 station never quite pulling off the action man look , the mayor launched last years @entity86 at @entity87 after speeding down the @entity88 on a poppy branded @entity90 the @entity49 high flier donned captain 's hat inside an @entity95 flight simulator at the opening of the @entity97 visiting a new @entity98 where his head was wrapped with white material before he was given the ceremonial red dot mark , or tilak , on his forehead the @entity49 big gun later joined members of the armed forces and volunteers for a gun salute in front of @entity110 while most politicians might have just posed next to a crushed car outside @entity113 , @entity10 climbed on top of it to dwarf metropolitan police commissioner @entity116 there is almost nothing he will not happily try his hand at , including making a @entity121 chocolate souffle when not trying to stitch up the @entity49 leadership , @entity10 had a go at sewing on a visit to a clothing factory in @entity57 in february last year always keen to be in the driving seat , he tried @entity128 at a project in @entity130 , ostensibly to promote a new volunteering programme in november 2012 , @entity10 clambered up a high chair wrapped in tinsel at @entity134 , apparently to promote shopping in the @entity136 during a visit to @entity138 in october last year , he insisted he was beating the drum for @entity141 business always keen to show off his sporting prowess - or lack of it - he rarely misses a change to pick up a cricket bat , as he did during a game with local @entity148 school boys on @entity149 in @entity150 in november 2012 he also joined in with the ' @entity151 ' with former rugby player @entity152 and local children involved in the @entity154 in @entity148 he has also had a go at wheelchair rugby to launch the @entity157 at the @entity158 as far back as 2011 the mayor of @entity57 was showing off his basketball skills to launch @entity161 using a rather old - fashioned wooden tennis racket , he took part in a celebrity tennis match at @entity165 's to raise money for the @entity167 in june last year to mark the @entity168 , he bizarrely joined @entity170 star @entity169 to have a go at sitting volleyball at the @entity173 always keen to be seen as a friend of the stars , during the @entity176 performed the mobot almost as often as @entity178 himself in october last year he got a lesson in how to use a light sabre from sir @entity181 , who was receiving a @entity182 at the 57th @entity183 @entity10 hoped to clean up in the publicity stakes , posing with a broom and actress @entity186 to promote efforts to get @entity57 ready for the @entity188 feeling the squeeze , the mayor risked getting stuck on a rope bridge at the @entity158 during a visit with prince @entity193 earlier this year politicians normally settle for kissing babies , but @entity10 was happy to pucker up for a saltwater crocodile @entity197 , at @entity198 , @entity199 the @entity57 mayor looked uncomfortable in the saddle as he rode a horse at the launch of the @entity204 in may last year the new @entity206 extension connecting @entity207 with @entity208 also provided an opportunity to lark about for the cameras only @entity10 could make the opening of @entity206 's new @entity57 route quite such a spectacle celebrating @entity214 in @entity57 's @entity215 is guaranteed to provide a photo opportunity @entity218 colours , feathers and dancing girls ? @entity10 is never far away from a @entity222 pr stunt as the world 's gaze turned to @entity57 ahead of the @entity188 , what finer advert for the nation than the mayor of the greatest city in the world stuck up a zipwire clutching a flag and pleading with his aides to get him down			1

@entity226 joins @entity15 star to strut his stuff on the @entity237
the pair were promoting a scheme to use dancing to get fit in @entity57
it is just the latest ridiculous publicity stunt in @entity10 's back *catalogue*
from kissing crocodiles to go - *karts* and zipwires , no stunt is too daft
