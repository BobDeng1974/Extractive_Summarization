by @entity0 an estate agent was so fed up with the potholes scarring the streets of his city he decided to fill one himself - with a small tree			1
@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , was sick of seeing no action despite repeatedly reporting potholes to the city 's online reporting system			1
so he took a pot plant , wandered out to the middle of @entity15 , and planted the thing right in the middle of the street			0
but officials were not impressed with mr @entity6 's film , and have threatened him with legal action unless he agrees to remove references to city hall from the online clip			1
mr @entity6 's stunt comes as @entity7 is in the midst of a pothole crisis			1
a particularly severe winter has ravaged the city 's streets and while , the city has approved $ 8million to repair roads , that 's well short of the $ 24million its estimated is needed			0
so the parody video appears to have touched a rather raw nerve with city officials			1
mr @entity6 told wthr.com reporter @entity66 : ' there was n't a lot of thought behind it			1
there was a pothole and a plant and i thought this might be fun			0
' mr @entity6 's video urges fellow citizens to ' adopt a pothole ' , with a message that reads : ' volunteers pitch in to fill $ 16million funding gap in @entity81 's lame pot hole repair program			1
' citizens are planting shrubs and trees in intersections & streets throughout the city			0
' mayor @entity88 leaders lauded the effort as a fine example of the public / private partnerships that make @entity81 a great place to live			0
' it then shows the scene as mr @entity6 walks out into the middle of @entity15 and plants a small tree in a deep pothole close to a junction			2
it again exhorts viewers to ' adopt a pothole today ! ' before adding the phone number for the mayor 's @entity105 and the web address of the city 's pothole reporting service			2
mr @entity6 said of the film : ' i was clearly having fun , but this is a serious issue			2
' that final message that is the one that has irked @entity7 council officials			2
they say it implies that the parody is in fact a real , council - sponsored campaign and they have ordered mr flock to take it down			0
but he remains steadfast : ' i 'm not going to take it down			0
if they put me in jail for civil disobedience , hopefully something good happens			0

@entity6 from @entity7 was fed up with reporting potholes to the city
so he took matters into his own hands and did a bit of guerilla gardening
now the city is threatening legal action over a video of the stunt on @entity142
