the man dubbed ' @entity2 's scariest police chief ' will not lose his job after posting ' disturbing ' videos of himself firing assault rifles and threatening liberals because the town 's mayor thinks he is exercising his freedom of speech			1
@entity10 is the only police officer in the tiny hamlet of @entity12 , @entity13 , but has caused serious concern following his appearances in a slew of foul mouthed and provocative videos in which he attacks secretary of state @entity18 and makes rude slurs against liberals			1
the self - professed gun fanatic and militia member , who carries an @entity24 to work policing his town of 700 people , has been unapologetic about his conduct denying all claims he is a ' delusional lunatic ' and claims the @entity30 clips were ' designed to get people 's attention			1
he was off - duty and was the only person armed in the altercation			0
to date , over 40,000 people have viewed @entity10 's videos - which he uploads under the banner of his @entity51 - which he claims is designed to protect the rights of all @entity2 , but is n't a militia - despite being armed			1
' what he does in his private life , we have no control of , ' @entity12 mayor @entity54 told @entity59 of the @entity60 when asked about the video			1
in one video @entity10 uploaded to @entity30 on july 15th , the 14 - year veteran tells viewers offended by his profanity to ' go f * * k yourself '			1
second amendment : @entity10 sports one of his modified rifles and the uniform of his @entity51 ( right ) chief @entity10 - pictured in 2010 - shot himself in the hand a year later after he tried to split up a bar fight ' f * * k all you libtards out there , as a matter of fact , read my shirt , ' rants @entity10 as he turns to reveal the back of his t - shirt which reads , ' @entity73 take it in the a * *			1
' ' you take it in the a * * a and i do n't give a f * * k what you say so you can all just go f * * k yourselves , ' says @entity10			2
' if you f * * king maniacs want to turn this into an armed revolt , knock yourselves out			0
i 'm not about that , so see you on the other side			0
' in a second video uploaded to @entity30 later that day , @entity10 takes it on himself to pretend to apologize to the thousands of people who wrote him messages of complaint			1
the unnerving video begins with a mock - apology to all those ' libtards ' who claimed their feelings were hurt by his language and then begins a rant about calling secretary of state john kerry a ' traitor '			1
in the video he claims to be annoyed by a recent news article in which @entity18 says the @entity111 would sign an arms control treaty which many conservatives see as a stealth assault on the @entity39			1
' that piece of s * * t traitor , ' yells @entity10 into the camera			1
' who is he to decide what we can and ca n't own ? and f * * k the @entity111 who are they to decide what we , the @entity2 people , can own ? ' ' i 've got a message to @entity18 and to these c * * ksuckers over in the @entity128 anything you want to sign			1
it 's not going to mean s * * t. ' you know what i have to say to you ? come and take it , motherf * * kers			0
' angry : in his first video posted on july 15th - police chief @entity10 shows how he feels about liberals - while sporting a @entity142 flag on his t - shirt hate : chief @entity10 shows off his real attitudes towards liberals with a motto on the back of his t - shirt in his july 15th video @entity10 then proceeds to fire off rounds from his assault weapon , calling it his ' sincere apology			1
' after firing the first weapon , @entity10 screams out , ' i 'm hurting some feelings today			2
all you f * * king libtards out there , all you f * * king crybabies , grow a pair of balls , and man the f * * k up , all right ? ' in an interview with the @entity164 , @entity10 affirmed his right to make the videos			1
' i think the video is in support of the @entity175 — the support of the @entity176 , the right to express your thoughts and words freely without reprisal from any government , ' said @entity10			2
' that ’s why i used the vocabulary i did			0
as for the firing of the guns , that is my second amendment right			0
i have the right to keep and bear arms regardless of what the government says that i do n’t			0
' @entity10 's @entity187 , despite stating they are not a militia are still armed and declare they will , ' defend our @entity175 our country from tyranny only if needed			2
' attack on @entity18 : in his second video , @entity10 pretended to apologize and then launched into a violent tirade against @entity18 culminating in him firing a round of assault rifle fire @entity12 mayor @entity54 ( left ) , has refused to fire her police chief @entity10 ( right ) because he was not wearing a uniform when he made his controversial comments uploaded : this is how @entity200 announced to the world his first video attacking liberals onto @entity204 he also hosts his own regular radio show and has uploaded videos to @entity30 in which he claims he is being followed by suspicious helicopters and unidentified members of the military			1
the chief , @entity10 , the one - man police force of tiny @entity12 , population about 800 , and some other gun - rights advocates view the treaty — which @entity215 would have to ratify for the @entity2 to take part — as a step toward restricting the domestic use of more conventional weapons that are personal property			1
in a telephone interview , @entity10 said he made the videos to draw attention to what he views as the erosion of the constitutional rights of free speech and to bear arms and to speak out for the many others who are afraid to do so			2
he also said he is increasingly concerned about what he views as a government out of control , citing the @entity234 's use of drones , the @entity237 's collection of hundreds of millions of @entity2 ' phone records and the @entity240 's scrutiny of applications for tax - exempt status by politically active groups			1
' i 'm trying to wake people up to say , ' hey , there 's a lot more going on than meets the eye			0
' a lot more , ' @entity10 said in an interview from @entity251 where the 41 - year - old father of four was vacationing			2
' it goes way beyond the @entity39 , the @entity176			0
our founding fathers did n't intend for our government to be the way it is			0
' @entity10 , who called himself ' a wholeheartedly good man who loves his country , ' acknowledged that some people were upset by the videos , but he said he does not regret posting them and insisted that many more people were supportive of them			2

the council , which has had a contract with @entity10 for 14 years , is planning to address the matter with @entity10 in a private session wednesday , @entity267 said			2
