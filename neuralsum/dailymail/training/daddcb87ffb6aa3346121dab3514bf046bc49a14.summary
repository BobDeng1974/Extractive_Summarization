resplendent in a powder blue coat , the @entity0 was every inch the glamorous mother - to - be as she arrived to meet volunteers in @entity5 this morning			2
but the brand behind her chic look was no big name designer			0
instead , her ' @entity9 came from a small @entity11 label called @entity12			1
to those who have watched the brand grow from a small shop in 2002 to the a-list favourite it is today , the royal endorsement will come as no surprise			0
along with today 's £ 195 coat and £ 95 blue and green floral dress , she also opted for the brand when making her debut in @entity34			0
on that occasion , it was the glamorous £ 225 plum boucle @entity37 coat that was chosen - and true to form , the design has since sold out repeatedly			0
@entity12 is the brainchild of @entity11 expat @entity40 who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on @entity23			1
' @entity43 has always been in my blood , ' explains @entity40			0
' my grandparents supplied fabrics to some of the top fashion houses in @entity50 but it was n’t until my friends started to fall pregnant that the idea for @entity12 came about			2
big moment : @entity12 went stratospheric when the @entity55 chose this £ 39 dress for @entity58 's first photo old faithful : @entity20 returned to @entity12 for her second pregnancy , seen here wearing it in @entity34 ' they struggled to find maternity clothes they liked and used to come to me with alteration requests for their clothes			0
' i spotted a gap in the market for fashion forward maternity clothes and the business developed from there			1
' the brand enjoyed modest success from the outset but the real making of the brand as a fashion force to be reckoned with came in august 2013 when the @entity55 wore the label for @entity81 's first photo shoot			1
pictured smiling happily on the sunny lawn of her parents ' @entity84 home , the @entity0 looked every bit the yummy mummy as she cradled her son , then just over a month old , in her lap. the dress , a plum coloured wrap style , was a cheap chic £ 39 number by @entity12 - and swiftly sold out			1
since then , the brand has gone from strength to strength and has amassed an a-list following to rival the likes of @entity98			0
brains : 40 - year - old @entity40 is the brains behind @entity12 and launched the brand in 2002 royal approval : another to wear the brand is @entity104 , seen here in it for an event in september 2013 chic : country singer @entity109 wore a dress by the brand for an appearance on the @entity113 glamorous : @entity114 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) both wore the brand while pregnant singers @entity117 and @entity119 , model @entity120 and actress @entity115 and @entity121 are just some of the names who have turned to the brand while pregnant			1
' @entity12 has grown from just one shop on @entity126 to being stocked in department stores all over the world with a celebrity following to match , ' comments fashion expert @entity130			2
according to @entity132 , it is the brand 's insistence on style rather than smocking that has won it so many fans - and its a trend she expects to see continue			0
' the label ’s pieces are designed specifically for women who do n’t want to compromise on style just because they ’re expecting , ' she explains , ' so it ’s no surprise the @entity0 has worn @entity12 so often in her pregnancies			1
' her classic take on fashion suits the brand ’s sophisticated and elegant aesthetic			0
' ' at @entity12 , we design all of our maternity clothes with a fashion focus , ' confirms @entity40 , who says everything is made with the changing bodies of pregnant women in mind			1
looking good : @entity156 is pictured here wearing @entity12 during an event last november rock chick : @entity117 and @entity119 are both fans of the brand and wore it while pregnant yummy mummy : @entity163 is also a fan of the @entity165 maternity brand ( not pictured ) ' our collections offer something for everyone , with a wide range of styles from @entity50 chic classics to rock chic glamour			1
' and she is n't wrong			0
while the @entity0 plumps for styles at the classic end of the spectrum , a quick glance at @entity109 looking every inch the rock chick in the brand 's £ 55 ' graphic ' maternity dress is enough to prove that there 's plenty of choice			1
others , among them @entity187 , have taken advantage of @entity12 's stretchy separates , while @entity104 is among the big names who have opted for the brand 's evening wear while waiting for @entity193 to arrive			2
' most women today want to stay true to their style through pregnancy and this is our brand motto , ' explains @entity40			2
' they are looking for maternity clothes that flatter their new shape and to be versatile enough to wear day and night			0
' if @entity40 's large and growing celebrity following is any indication , @entity12 is certainly living up to its stylish slogan .			2

@entity109 , @entity119 and @entity117 among fans of the label
