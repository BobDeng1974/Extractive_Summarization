by @entity1 reporter published : 08:23 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 04:14 est , 9 august 2012 ' my life is in tatters ' : @entity5 looks at pictures of her children as she tries to piece together her memories after a freak fall made her forget 20 years the last thing @entity11 remembers is tucking her six - year - old son and two - year - old daughter into bed for the night			1
two decades on , those children have grown up and graduated from university – but miss @entity11 can not recall any of it			1
after falling at work and hitting her head , more than 20 years have been erased from her memory			2
she is convinced she is still in her 30s and is stunned every time she sees the face of a 55 - year - old staring back at her from the mirror			2
to her , it is still 1990 , when @entity26 was prime minister and mobile phones were the size of bricks			2
the mother of three can not even remember the birth of her younger son @entity33 , now 19			1
before the accident , miss @entity11 worked as a care home manager and was in line for promotion , but she now finds it hard to make a cup of tea because she repeatedly forgets to switch the kettle on			1
yet she has shocked her partner by waking up in the middle of the night and reciting an @entity45 song in perfect @entity46 , despite not speaking the language			0
miss @entity11 was diagnosed with retrograde amnesia after she slipped on a wet floor while working at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			1
she was told she had nothing more than a minor concussion and sent home from hospital			0
however , it soon became clear that she was having problems with both short - term and long - term memory			0
since then , she has struggled with simple tasks such as cooking and cleaning , and her partner of four years , @entity63 , 60 , has given up work to look after her			0
miss @entity11 , who admits that it feels as if she is being hugged by strangers when her children @entity69 , 23 , @entity70 , 27 , and @entity33 embrace her , said : ‘ i remember tucking the children into bed when they were about six and two			1
' i have been left without a sense of motherhood ' : the last thing @entity77 , 55 , remembers is putting her young son and daughter to bed in the early nineties as a 34 - year - old the woman she still thinks she is : miss @entity11 with her children @entity69 and @entity70 in 1990 miss @entity11 's son @entity33 , pictured left in 1992 as a newborn , and right last year			1
miss @entity11 's youngest son , @entity33 , pictured this year : she is unable to remember any of his life at all , even giving birth to him ' then i woke up and it was 20 years later			1
' i can not even begin to describe the pain and sense of loss i feel every day of not being able to remember my children growing up , let alone not being able to remember my youngest child			1
@entity11 's brain injury has robbed her of the memories of her own life over the last 20 years , and everything that has happened in the wider world			1
among the events she ca n't remember are @entity104 being released in 1990 and end of apartheid in @entity106 , the break - up of the @entity108 in 1991			0
nor can she remember the two @entity109 , the opening of the @entity111 in 1994 , the death of princess @entity113 in 1997 , world - wide @entity115 celebrations on december 31 , 1999 , and september 11 in 2001			0
since 9/11 , @entity11 ca n't recall the @entity117 tsunami that struck parts of @entity119 in 2004 , @entity116 in 2005 , the election of @entity122 's first black president , @entity121 , in 2008 , and pop singer @entity123 's death in june 2009			1
‘ i have been left without a sense of motherhood as there is such a huge gap			0
' i have no memory of their progress through childhood and teenage years , their troubles and triumphs , their friends and the laughter , tears and love that makes up normal family life			0
‘ i have no memory of my elder two children graduating from university			2
my youngest is a stranger to me			2
' i have been able to develop a relationship of sorts with my elder two but it is more as friendship than mother and child			0
' the results of the accident have left my life in complete tatters			0
‘ my relationship with my partner is now under a lot of strain as i am almost totally dependent on him			0
’ miss @entity11 , from @entity161 , @entity52 , suffered a minor traumatic brain injury when she slipped in july last year			1
it has caused retrograde amnesia , short - term memory problems , anxiety and concentration issues			0
she is a qualified nurse with a degree in psychology and gave university lectures on behavioural psychology before the fall , but now fears she will never work again			0
the accident is being investigated and miss @entity11 is considering fighting for compensation			2
@entity176 of brain injury charity @entity175 said : ‘ the severity of a brain injury does not always relate to the amount of memory loss someone has as a result			2
retrograde amnesia can completely change someone ’s personality			0
’ miss @entity11 at her son @entity70 's graduation in 2010 , left , and right , her daughter @entity69 at her graduation party : she has been able to rebuild a relationship with her two older children , but more as a friend than as a mother			1
