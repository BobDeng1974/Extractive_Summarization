by @entity0 last updated at 12:16 pm on 27th january 2012 @entity2 ’s kepler space telescope has discovered 11 new planetary systems hosting 26 confirmed planets			1
it 's the latest find from a two - year space scan , and brings the total to 60 confirmed planets			1
the new haul triples the number of multi-planet solar systems found by @entity12			1
@entity13 , a @entity12 scientist at @entity2 says , ' in just two years staring at a patch of sky not much bigger than your fist , @entity12 has discovered more than 60 planets			1
our galaxy is positively loaded with planets of all sizes and orbits			1
' diagrams of the multi-planet systems detected by the @entity12 space telescope : the planets range in size from 1.5 times the size of @entity30 to ones bigger than the gas giant @entity33 the planets orbit close to their host stars and range in size from 1.5 times the radius of @entity30 to larger than @entity33			1
fifteen are between @entity30 and @entity40 in size			0
further observations will be required to determine which are rocky like @entity30 and which have thick gaseous atmospheres like @entity40			0
all the new planets are closer to their host star than @entity47 is to our @entity48 @entity50 , a star that is older and more massive than our @entity48 , had the most planets			1
the system hosts five planets , ranging in size from 1.5 to 5 times that of @entity30			1
' prior to the @entity12 mission , we knew of perhaps 500 exoplanets across the whole sky , ' said @entity13 , @entity12 program scientist at @entity62 in @entity63			2
@entity12 identifies planet candidates by repeatedly measuring the change in brightness of stars to detect when a planet passes in front of the star			2
that passage casts a small shadow toward @entity30 and the @entity12 spacecraft			2
the planets were detected by monitoring changes in brightness as they orbit in front of their stars			0
scientists will now try to establish whether they are rocky , like earth , or gaseous , like @entity40 each of the new confirmed planetary systems contains two to five closely spaced transiting planets			1
in tightly packed planetary systems , the gravitational pull of the planets on each other causes some planets to accelerate and some to decelerate along their orbits			0
@entity12 detects this effect by measuring the changes , or so - called @entity94 ( @entity95 )			2
planetary systems with @entity95 can be verified without requiring extensive ground - based observations , accelerating confirmation of planet candidates			0
the @entity95 detection technique also increases @entity12 ’s ability to confirm planetary systems around fainter and more distant @entity104 of the systems ( @entity12 - 25 , @entity12 - 27 , @entity12 - 30 , @entity12 - 31 and @entity50 ) contain a pair of planets where the inner planet orbits the star twice during each orbit of the outer planet			1
four of the systems ( @entity12 - 23 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 ) contain a pairing where the outer planet circles the star twice for every three times the inner planet orbits its star			2
the properties of a star provide clues for planet detection			0
the decrease in the star ’s brightness and duration of a planet transit , combined with the properties of its host star , present a recognizable signature			0
when astronomers detect planet candidates that exhibit similar signatures around the same star , the likelihood of any of these planet candidates being a false positive is very low			0
' the approach used to verify the @entity50 planets shows the overall reliability is quite high , ' said @entity145 , planetary scientist at @entity147 at @entity148 , @entity149 , and lead author of the paper on @entity50			0
these discoveries are published in four different papers in the @entity154 and the @entity155 .			0

one solar system with **sun** older than ours has five planets
find doubles the number of confirmed @entity12 planets
@entity166 leads @entity2 scientists to say galaxy is ' positively loaded with planets of all sizes '
one **sun** older than ours has five planets
technique used could speed up space telescope 's hunt for planets
