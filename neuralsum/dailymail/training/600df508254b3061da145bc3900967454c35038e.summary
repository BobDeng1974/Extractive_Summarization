by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 24 march 2013 updated : 03:15 est , 25 march 2013 scarce donor organs meant for @entity3 patients are being sold to wealthy foreigners for tens of thousands of pounds			1
a leading hospital has confirmed that 19 private overseas patients bought donated livers in the past two years			1
such organs are in short supply			2
of the 550 @entity3 patients waiting for a liver , one in six is expected to die before they can get a transplant			1
surgeons at @entity15 have carried out 19 operations in the past two year into patients from @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 but since 2011 , @entity23 in @entity24 has given livers to patients from @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
the trust is likely to have been paid around £ 1million for all the transplants , but it refused to disclose how much it received for them individually			2
although experts have condoned the practice as ‘ morally wrong ’ , it is not illegal because the government does not believe it prevents @entity3 patients from having transplants			1
@entity35 , a consultant transplant surgeon at @entity36 and also a member of the liver advisory panel said the private transplants were wrong the @entity40 has refused to implement a ban – ignoring the advice of a specially commissioned taskforce – and claims organ donations are increasing			2
but senior doctors at other hospitals which do not sell organs privately say @entity3 patients must be given priority			1
@entity49 , a consultant transplant surgeon at @entity50 , said : ‘ there are not enough donors and too many @entity3 - entitled recipients to give the organs away			1
’ professor @entity35 , who holds the same position at @entity36 , said : ‘ to say “ this liver is not usable for anyone in this country , i am going to give it to someone from another country ” – that is unacceptable			0
’ @entity63 , a 46 - year - old mother from @entity64 , suffers from a condition that causes her immune system to attack her liver			0
she has been on a transplant waiting list since 2010			0
‘ organs are a gift from some - body and it is the most fantastic gift , ’ she said			0
‘ private [ transplants ] should not be brought into it			0
‘ when you first get put on the list you are told to pack a bag because it could be tonight			0
my bag has been packed for two and a half years			0
’ around 9,000 @entity80 need a transplant but a shortage of donors means that only 3,000 operations can be performed each year			2
surgeons estimate that 18 per cent of patients waiting for a replacement organ will die before they receive one			0
in 2009 the @entity40 commissioned the @entity88 to review the practice of hospitals selling organs privately			0
it concluded that ‘ financial gain from the transplant of donated organs feels morally wrong ’ and recommended an outright ban			2
while patients from @entity98 countries are entitled to donated organs on the @entity3 if they are a suitable match , those from outside the continent are only allowed to buy @entity3 organs if they are not wanted by patients in @entity80			1
this is usually because doctors have decided the organs are too old or damaged to be of much benefit			0
but experts are concerned that doctors are ‘ misjudging ’ the quality , meaning very good organs are being sold abroad			0
at present , @entity23 is the only @entity3 trust which has admitted to selling organs			1
a spokesman for the trust said it complies with the ‘ rules and regulations relating to liver transplant surgery and the allocation of organs ’			2
a @entity40 spokesman said having a transplant privately ‘ in no way means getting an organ more quickly ’ and claimed there is ‘ no evidence they stop @entity3 patients having transplants or reduce public confidence in donating ’ .			1

@entity15 carried out 19 operations in 2 years
it is believed the trust has been paid around £ 1m for the operations
the organs have been given to fee paying non @entity142 patients
there are currently 550 @entity3 patients awaiting a life *saving* transplant
