hospital admissions for stress have risen by seven per cent in just one year , it was revealed today			2
stress admission rates at hospitals in @entity5 rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to may , compared to 5,960 in the year beforehand			1
the most likely patients were people of working age , from 18 to 60 , figures from the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) show			0
on the increase : stress admission rates at hospitals in @entity5 rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to may , compared to 5,960 the year before the report , which considers admissions only and not cases dealt with solely in @entity15 , shows that stress admissions rose at a faster rate than overall admissions overall , which increased by about 2 per cent in the same period			1
men accounted for 54 per cent of stress admissions , but women made up 63 per cent of all anxiety admissions and admission rates were higher for females than males across all age groups			1
the figures also showed that admissions rose with increasing age until 50 , when they declined steadily			2
@entity8 chief executive @entity29 said : ' it might be assumed that stress and anxiety are conditions that result in a journey to a @entity36 consulting room rather than a hospital ward			0
' however , our figures suggest thousands of cases a year arise where patients suffering from stress or anxiety become hospitalised in @entity5			1
' the @entity43 had the highest admission rate for stress of any region , while the @entity47 had the lowest			1
the report covered two different conditions - stress ( the feeling of being under too much emotional or mental pressure ) and also anxiety ( the feeling of mild or severe unease , such as worry or fear )			0
in contrast to stress , admissions for anxiety fell by 3 per cent in the same time period , from 8,810 to 8,590 and admissions for this condition were highest among the elderly			0
mr @entity29 said : ' the report highlights a marked contrast between stress and anxiety admissions to hospital over the last two 12 month periods			1
' on one hand , stress admissions have risen by 7 per cent to 6,370 ; while on the other anxiety admissions have fallen by 3 per cent to 8,590			2
' despite this shift in balance however , many more cases of anxiety were admitted than for stress			0
' there is also a clear difference in the likely age of a patient admitted for one of these conditions			0
while working - aged people account for the highest rate of admissions for stress , it appears hospital admissions resulting from anxiety are more amongst the elderly			0
