@entity0 waited two years and four months for @entity1 to pay a visit to the @entity3			1
he will not have left with thoughts of a new - look @entity5			1
he had eight potential recruits among the 22 starters , but they could not have offered up less of a show			0
it 's a shame considering the form , excitement and shock value both sides have provided since this campaign started			2
but there was none of that here , except perhaps for some of the latter from the stupid challenge of @entity21 towards the end of the first half			1
@entity0 's record signing @entity21 was sent off for a second bookable offence , it was a huge blow for @entity29 's side as the @entity30 had been playing well @entity0 players look dejected as @entity32 slams home @entity34 's winner late on in the game @entity32 is surrounded by team - mates as @entity38 's @entity34 picked up another three points @entity32 's strike with 10 minutes remaining was enough to win it for @entity34 , the @entity40 was set up by last week 's hero @entity43 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 6 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 5 ; ki 6.5 ( @entity49 85 ) , @entity50 5.5 ; @entity51 5.5 ( @entity52 59 , 6 ) , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6.5 ; @entity55			1

booked : @entity55 sent off : @entity55 @entity34 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity62 6 ; @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 5 ( @entity66 46 , 6 ) , @entity67 6 ; @entity68 6 ( @entity69 63 , 6 ) , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 5.5 ( @entity32 69 , 7 ) ; long 5.5 , @entity43 6 , @entity72 6			1

booked : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity70 referee : @entity79 5 att : 20,596 @entity80 : @entity32 it afforded him a second yellow card and turned the match in @entity34 's favour , with victory sealed by @entity32 's late winner			1
' after the red card it changed , ' said @entity89 manager @entity38 , who now has 10 points from five games			1
' this start is nice for the fans			0
as the manager , i have to keep quiet and continue doing what we are doing			2
there is no time to celebrate			0
' @entity29 , predictably , counted the cost of @entity21 's dismissal			1
' he was distraught with himself , ' he said			0
' you make mistakes , i 've done it myself			0
he will learn from it			0
he held his hands up			0
' we did n't deserve to lose that game			2
football can be harsh sometimes			0
' for @entity1 's purposes , it was about searching out new possibilities — overdue possibilities in the mind of @entity116			1
but as valid an argument as that has been in the past , only @entity117 emerged from @entity116 's trio of candidates with any significant credit			0
@entity51 was hauled off after 59 minutes and @entity50 never got going			0
for @entity34 , @entity122 left on a stretcher in the second half after an innocuous challenge from @entity46			1
' it is his foot but i do not think it is serious , ' said @entity38			0
it had all started quite promisingly for the @entity131 of @entity0 , who are still waiting for the return from injury of @entity135 , their most effective eligible player			2
within 10 minutes , @entity50 took possession in the centre and played a pass into the run of @entity117 , whose low cross from the left was perfect			1
@entity51 entered the box from the right and was inches away from connecting			0
former @entity146 forward @entity21 's two - footed lunge on @entity34 defender @entity65 was enough to earn a second yellow card for the forward @entity53 , seen here taking a shot under pressure from @entity64 , has been hugely impressive since rejoining the club from @entity152 @entity0 midfielder @entity51 skips past fellow @entity153 @entity67 , who is on loan from @entity156 title favourites @entity155 mins @entity157 @entity0 total 104.7 65.1 @entity53 90 11.9 7.4 @entity45 90 11.3 7.0 @entity50 90 11.1 6.9 @entity34 total 113.7 70.6 @entity70 90 12.2 7.6 @entity158 90 11.9 7.4 @entity72 90 11.7 7.2 data courtesy of the @entity160 , the @entity161 of the @entity156 @entity117 had a better chance after 28 minutes , running on to @entity53 's pass and hitting the bar			1
@entity21 then had a header cleared off the line by @entity67 as his peculiar season continued			2
he scored 25 last season but is yet to get off the mark this time around			0
it got worse when he was red - carded six minutes before the break			2
his first booking , for running into @entity64 , was a touch harsh ; his second was justified , a senseless tackle from behind on @entity65			0
@entity0 had dominated but the red card let @entity34 take control			1
@entity43 glanced a header wide with their first real chance after 65 minutes and @entity72 then drew a comfortable save from @entity44 with a free - kick			1
@entity32 , on for @entity181 , finally found a way through after 80 minutes , shooting hard across @entity44			2
@entity1 left before the whistle , which was probably fair enough			2
@entity5 manager @entity1 had been criticised by @entity29 for never coming to watch the @entity153 contingent in south @entity187 play , that was rectified today @entity34 's £ 12million striker @entity158 is tackled by @entity0 left - back @entity48 during their @entity156 clash at the @entity3 @entity0 manager @entity29 , who many considered not to be good enough for @entity0 , has enjoyed a brilliant start to the @entity156 season video red card changed the game - @entity116 @entity43 , who scored a brace in last weekend 's 4 - 0 win over @entity197 , passes the ball under pressure from @entity0 midfielder @entity200 after the huge summer clear - out at @entity34 that saw most of their best players leave , @entity38 has managed to get @entity34 playing well again @entity0 winger @entity117 and @entity34 's @entity63 battle for the ball during their @entity156 match in south @entity187 @entity0 goalkeeper @entity44 , who joined from @entity206 on a free transfer this summer , was rarely troubled by the visitors			1

@entity0 lose to @entity34 draw 0 - 1 at @entity3
@entity32 scores winner with just 10 minutes remaining
@entity43 , who scored twice last weekend , set up @entity32
@entity21 sent off for two bookable offences in first half
@entity5 manager @entity1 watched the game after @entity29 claimed he never watched @entity0 's games
