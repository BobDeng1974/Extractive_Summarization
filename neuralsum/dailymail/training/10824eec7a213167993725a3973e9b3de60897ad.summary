a chef has cooked up a dish so spicy he has to wear a gas mask and protective industrial gloves to stop the powerful vapours knocking him out			1
@entity6 , 34 , wanted to create the world ’s hottest curry but feared the steam and smell of it would make him pass out as he served it up to customers			1
so he puts on the mask , goggles and 3mm thick gloves whenever he cooks his ' @entity16 ' which registers 12million on the @entity18 heat measurement scale - almost three times as a powerful as police pepper spray			1
the customers must wear two pairs of gloves when eating the meal which has the spiciest chillies in the world including the @entity47 and the @entity48			1
mr @entity6 said : ' we have made sure that our staff are trained in first aid so we can look after the customers before the paramedics arrive			1
' when they eat it , their body has a massive adrenalin rush and if they have heart or any medical concerns we wo n’t let them try the sauce			2
' the @entity16 chicken drumsticks are soaked in mango and tamarind @entity65 mixed with 15 of each of the four chillies before adding a 5ml of special chilli extract registering 13 million @entity18 the chillies are then placed in a pan to reduce for an hour			1
only 5 - 10ml of this potent cocktail is added to the @entity75 before being smothered on the drumsticks - the challenge is to eat 10 drumsticks in 15 minutes the challenge to eat 10 drumsticks in 15 minutes with a prize of £ 100 has only been attempted by 20 people and the record stands at two drumsticks he added : ' the body gets this massive rush which can paralyse their face for up to 30 minutes and give them body shakes			2
the last guy who tried it was sweating all over			2
' he was slapping his face to try and feel anything but it was paralysed			0
it is the adrenalin and the body trying to sort itself out			0

the last guy who tried it was sweating all over ' @entity6 , director of restaurant he said : ' this sauce is like weaponry			1
it is at least three times hotter than the pepper spray the police use			0
the @entity109 army used pepper spray to keep the public in order and that was only 3 million @entity18 - it could deal with a lot of demons out there			1
' if i did n’t wear an oxygen masks when cooking i would be out of action for the rest of the day			0
' the components of the sauce are quarantined in a medical cupboard with hazard signs warning all staff about the dangerous ingredients inside			0
but mr @entity6 said he is safety conscious adding : ' everything is kept in metal containers in a medical cupboard			1
it is paramount that all the ingredients to this sauce are kept separate from everything else			0
' if somebody used these ingredients for the wrong curry it would be disastrous and we would be in a lot of trouble			2
we have hazard signs around the cupboard alerting all the staff to the fact that what lies in there is definitely hazardous in the wrong dish			2

' now when they come they give the challengers something to calm them down and they check their heart rate and blood pressure because the adrenalin rush from the hot peppers makes you feel like you have run a marathon			0
' '' you get such a rush but it can be dangerous			0
we have to make sure everyone is okay ' @entity6 ' you get such a rush but it can be dangerous			1
we have to make sure everyone is okay as people can collapse			0

we are covered for £ 10million in public liability so as long as customers have no health risks and sign a disclaimer , all is fine			1
we do take safety very seriously though			0
' i want to use my @entity191 upbringing to educate @entity267 that a @entity268 is not hot , it is what we eat for breakfast at home			0
' the cruel nature of our sauce is that the heat comes slowly and then lasts for hours			2
it starts off sweet and the longer you wait the more painful it gets			0
' it is the world ’s hottest sauce			2
it is like an atomic bomb has gone off inside you			0
you will be completely blown away , like somebody putting an iron on your lips and leaving it there and then that feeling moves inside to your organs - like burning from the inside out			0
