retired surgeon @entity0 said on sunday that he could form a committee to explore a bid for the 2016 @entity4 presidential nomination this month and make a formal announcement in may			1
' that 's a reasonable time frame , ' @entity0 told @entity7 when asked by host @entity8 about the timing of an exploratory committee and formal announcement			1
' we 're putting all that together , ' @entity0 is a former @entity7 contributor who is popular with @entity17 conservatives and ranked fourth among possible @entity4 candidates in a recent @entity7 poll of potential voters in @entity21			1
he finished behind former @entity23 governor @entity22 , former @entity25 governor @entity24 , and @entity27 senator @entity26			0
the poll showed growing support for @entity0 , a bestselling author and conservative commentator , with 10 percent of potential voters saying they would vote for @entity0 , up from about 8 percent last year			1
with a dozen @entity4 thinking seriously about running for president in 2016 and 10 more talking up the idea , it 's a good time to be an experienced campaign hand			1
potential candidates are scrambling to sort through the rosters of campaign veterans in the early voting states of @entity21 and @entity41 and elsewhere in a talent search that reflects the fact that the @entity4 field for 2016 is the largest in recent memory			1
the competition , dubbed by some as a ' staff primary , ' aims to find the right of mix of get - out - the - vote organizers , digital experts , fund - raising stars and messaging professionals able to set up a functioning campaign			0
' there is a known universe of operatives with many of them headquartered in early primary states , ' said @entity4 strategist @entity61 , a senior adviser to @entity62 in his 2012 presidential campaign			2
' right now i think the contest is focused on all the candidates trying to go after that universe of staffers			0
' as many as 21 @entity4 are in various stages of considering a presidential run , far more than the dozen or so who gave it a go four years ago			2
of these , probably 10 or 12 are really serious and the rest are testing the waters or are trying to promote their personal brand			0
every ideological slice of the @entity4 spectrum is represented , from mainstream former @entity23 governor @entity80 to @entity82 senator @entity81 , a favorite of the small government @entity17 movement , to libertarian @entity27 senator @entity26 to retired neurosurgeon @entity0 , a @entity7 personality			2
others exploring presidential runs include @entity90 governor @entity89 , former @entity92 ceo @entity91 and former @entity82 governor @entity93			0
the field is so large because there is no nominee - in - waiting as there is in the @entity99 arena , where former secretary of state @entity100 is widely seen as having a lock on the @entity99 nomination should she choose to run			0
there is also a younger generation of @entity4 leaders eager to make their mark like @entity109 governor @entity108 , who is 47 , and @entity23 senator @entity110 , 43 .			0
