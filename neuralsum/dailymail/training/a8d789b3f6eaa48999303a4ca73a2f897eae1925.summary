@entity1 pays tribute to her beloved father published : 17:01 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 08:57 est , 9 march 2014 on january 17 , my father , @entity4 , died			1
he was many extraordinary things : politician , author , builder , gardener , collector of tribal flags from @entity13 and renowned bon viveur			1
to me he was my father			1
to the rest of the world he was @entity4 , the @entity18 grandee who was smeared by the @entity19 in the worst possible way			1
so much about his death pains me – that we will never take me out for lunch again or compliment me on my shoes ; that i had three missed calls from him in the days before his death and that i had not got round to calling him back			1
family : @entity4 , then @entity31 , with his wife @entity32 holding @entity33 , then aged four i thought i was too busy			1
it pains me that my son @entity35 , now 18 months old , will never really know his grandfather			1
it pains me to think that the last year of my father ’s life was marred by lies and smears			1
and now it feels as though that scandal is all that people want to remember			1
just over a year ago , he was wrongly implicated as a paedophile by the @entity19			1
although the news report , which claimed that a senior @entity18 politician had abused boys in care in the 1970s and 1980s , did not name him , it might as well have			1
anger : @entity53 ( pictured ) said seeing her father 's name wrongly smeared still sickens her the @entity19 , instead , fed his name to tweeters and bloggers , setting him up for trial by social media			1
within hours , if you googled ‘ @entity4 ’ you got ‘ paedo ’			1
even now i find that excruciating to write			1
it makes me feel sick to my very core			1
aged 70 , retired and living a quiet life in the depths of @entity71 , he found himself at the centre of a media storm the likes of which i could never have imagined			1
through no fault or action of his own , he became the subject of hatred and abuse			1
it was like some kind of hideously surreal nightmare			1
i was just out of hospital , with a baby boy less than a week old , and he was on the front page of all the papers for all the wrong reasons ; reasons so wrong that my friends did n’t pick up the phone to talk to me about it because they did n’t know what to say			1
some people still have n’t mentioned it and it looms like an ugly elephant in the room			1
his name was cleared and the @entity19 , @entity99 and a number of high - profile tweeters such as journalist @entity102 all issued formal apologies			1
others , like @entity105 , who when she defamed my father ’s name had 56,000 @entity109 followers , did not and treated it with a distasteful flippancy			1
the mind boggles at such insensitivity and cruelty			1
my father spent the last year of his life in litigation , something he should never have had to do and that was far beneath what he deserved			1
apologies or no apologies , the damage was already done			1
a cloud of suspicion hung around him , indelible and poisonous			1
two days after he died , i stupidly checked @entity109			1
people who had never met him said that they were pleased that he had died			1
he was a courageous man			1
although he must have been terrified – i know i was – he complained not once			2
utterly steadfast , he refused to give up on what he knew to be right and went on to make legal history with a libel case against tweeters who had perpetuated the libel			2
he acted with the same honour and dignity with which he led his life			2
as @entity140 ’s treasurer and deputy chairman of the @entity18 , he was high on the @entity142 hit list			1
in 1990 , my parents and i were at our home in @entity147 , with the television on in the background when he saw a house on the screen that he liked the look of			2
it took him a moment to realise it was his			2
then the phone rang and it was @entity158			2
the @entity142 had placed 20lb of @entity159 ( the @entity161 bomb was 6lb ) under my bedroom window at @entity163 , our home in @entity165			1
as far as he was concerned , that was the end of one chapter			2
happy childhood : @entity174 at her parents ' @entity147 home in 1989 , when they were having sunday lunch @entity176 : a photo from the same day shows the @entity18 politician at ease and happy			2
she said his last year was ruined we moved to @entity182			2
i went to a local @entity185 school and he embarked on yet another collection			2
this time it was antique @entity182 glass beads , of which he had tens of thousands			2
previous collections had included antique garden implements , police truncheons and stuffed birds			2
his passion for collecting was fuelled by a love of learning , rather than by a desire for possession			2
he would buy and learn , sell and move on			2
in the 1960s his interest in contemporary sculpture was enough to keep the industry going			2
when he moved on to the next thing , he donated his entire collection , including works by sir @entity208 , to the @entity209			2
he loved art for art , not as an investment			2
he bought works by @entity214 painter @entity213 , enjoyed them and sold them for a few thousand pounds			0
when they sold again for millions , he could n’t have cared less			0
always pragmatic and unsentimental , he never indulged in drama , even in the most difficult of circumstances			0
in 1984 the @entity142 bombed the @entity161 hotel where prime minister @entity140 and most of her party were staying for the @entity18 conference			1
libel : @entity105 's infamous tweet which referenced false allegations that @entity4 was a paedophile @entity223 : she later described his lawyers as ambulance chasers and big bullies , denying she libelled him within hours of the explosion , he had arranged for the local branch of @entity232 to open so that other delegates who had also survived the attack and lost all their possessions could be dressed and ready in time to open the conference as planned			1
i remember him telling me that he hailed a black taxi and asked the cabbie to drive around @entity161 picking up anyone who he might see wandering around in their pyjamas and return them to the @entity232 store , where @entity245 stood waiting with a large wodge of cash , paying off the taxis for everyone			0
there were few problems that he could n’t solve , few obstacles he could n’t overcome			0
he was not a conventional father , any more than he was a conventional man			1
when i begged for a hamster , he gave me two zebras			0
he thought that they would make more interesting pets			0
when i wanted a wendy house , he insisted that i consult an architect for its construction			0
i think that i was seven at the time			0
he wrote a play for my puppets and had it bound in a leather book , with illustrations by the @entity182 artist @entity269			0
my doll ’s house was @entity272 and the desk in my nursery was a @entity277 collector ’s piece			0
clash : @entity105 outside the @entity279 , left , and @entity174 at her @entity147 home			0
she writes a food blog he was n’t one for school plays and parents ’ evenings , but even at the age of four he would take me for lunch with the photographer @entity287 or grandees of the party , such as @entity290			0
he believed that was the best education he could give me			0
he had a wicked sense of humour and relished situations that others might find awkward			0
once , i persuaded @entity140 , when she was prime minister , to play hide - and - seek with me at @entity163			0
we went in to the garden and she hid			0
we did n’t tell anyone what we were doing and when the detectives in charge of her protection could n’t find her , they raised an alarm			0
he had a wicked sense of humour and relished situations that others might find awkward			0
once , i persuaded @entity140 to play hide - and - seek with me			0
we went in to the garden and she hid			0
i was seeking @entity245 was tickled pink			0
they had a shared love of mischief and were great friends , as well as colleagues			0
we spent many christmases with the @entity140 , sometimes at @entity322 , sometimes in @entity147 or @entity182			0
my parents gave sunday lunches that became legendary : he would ply guests with extravagant wines and @entity328 would cook the food			0
anyone from @entity331 , the @entity332 artist , to @entity333 , the fashion designer , to half the @entity334 , to someone with a particular interest in poultry ( @entity245 also collected rare breeds of chickens ) , would gather round the table			0
as with everything he did , he cooked on a grand scale : he would scramble an egg with the same sense of occasion and enthusiasm as he would roast a whole goat on the spit and open fire in our kitchen			0
my life is , in so many ways , the polar opposite of my father ’s			0
i live in a flat in @entity147 above an @entity358 restaurant with my husband @entity359 , who works in finance , and our son			0
i write a blog , from my dining table , in which i share my recipes and stories , and try to recreate the charm and wonder of the meals of my childhood			0
a plump chicken for roasting , fresh fruit for the table or a jug of overblown pink peonies – these are all things that i do today			1
and they make me think of him			0
so much of who i am i owe to my father			0
but above all , i owe to him the belief that if you give all , you win all			0
because that is what he did			0
that is why i miss him			0
@entity174 blogs at from my dining table .			0

former mp was libelled by false allegations of paedophilia on social media
writing for @entity398 his *daughter* says the hurt is still raw today
she remembers a courageous man who survived high placing on @entity142 hit list
