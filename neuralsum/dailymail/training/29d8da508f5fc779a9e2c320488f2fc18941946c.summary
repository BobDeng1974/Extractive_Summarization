seeking to avoid the fate of a fellow @entity3 who fumbled the ball when asked about her support for president @entity6 , @entity1 senate candidate @entity0 said on friday that she did in fact vote for the @entity6 in the last two elections			1
' i did vote for the president , ' @entity0 told the @entity11 in an interview this afternoon			1
' i have said throughout the campaign that we need more people in @entity16 working with the president – @entity18 or @entity3 – to get things done			2
i pledge to do that on behalf of @entity21 , ' she added			0
when confronted by a tracker for @entity23 , a @entity18 opposition research outfit , on wednesday , @entity0 had refused to say whether she voted for @entity6 in 2008 and 2012			1
@entity0 was reportedly confronted by a tracker outside the venue and asked whether she voted for @entity6 for president			1
the @entity39 candidate would n't respond her only response was in the form of a grin she gave her questioner as she walked away from him and toward the entrance of the venue she was about to enter , an early voting center at the @entity33 , in @entity49 , @entity1			0
' ms. @entity0 , did you vote for president @entity6 in 2008 and 2012 ? ' the tracker had asked her , pouncing on an opportunity to toss @entity0 the same question that 's tripped up @entity27 @entity28 candidate @entity55 of @entity56			1
a @entity0 supporter can then be heard in the background telling the young man , ' would you leave her alone ? ' as @entity0 and her gaggle of supporters continued walking , other members of her entourage began touting president @entity6 's accomplishments			1
' yes , of course , yes , he ’s the president … he ’s done great things , ' one of the supporters said			0
' he 's doing great things			0
great things , ' another voice said in response			0
@entity0 's refusal to speak to the tracker is not surprising given his party affiliation and the nature of his question			1
but the @entity27 candidate 's non-answer could have come back to haunt her in her close race against businessman @entity81			1
multiple polls conducted in late september and early october had @entity81 leading @entity0 by several digits			2
a @entity85 poll released on wednesday shows a reversal , with @entity0 now up by three points			1
the race could just as easily flip back in @entity81 's favor in the next two and a half weeks , however , and pollsters expect this race to be a nail biter			0
@entity0 is the daughter of former @entity1 senator @entity93 , a notable @entity3 who has given thousands of dollars to @entity6 's election efforts			1
she 's currently on leave of absence from her day job as ceo of @entity1 - based non-profit organization @entity99			0
@entity81 is the cousin of former @entity1 gov. @entity100 , also a @entity18			2
the self - funded , former @entity102 head defeated @entity18 congressman @entity103 in a brutal primary this summer to win the @entity18 nomination			2
@entity0 and @entity81 are competing to replace retiring @entity18 politician @entity106			1
a third , @entity108 candidate , @entity107 , is also vying for the seat and could prove a spoiler on @entity111			0
@entity107 is steadily polling at five percent of the vote			0
if neither @entity0 or @entity81 is able to win 50 percent of the vote , @entity1 law calls for a run - off election that wo n't be held until early next year when other newly elected senators are already descending on @entity16 to begin the new legislative session			2
@entity118 , right , and her family participate in early voting on wednesday in @entity49			0
@entity0 is running against @entity18 @entity81			1
the two are virtually tied two and a half weeks ahead of the election			0
@entity0 said on friday that she did in fact vote for @entity6 in the last two presidential elections neither major political party wants an extended campaign season lasting into 2015 , and both the @entity127 and the @entity128 are pouring loads of cash into the race on behalf of their respective candidates			1
earlier this week the @entity128 announced that it would go dark in @entity56 , where its candidate repeatedly stumbled over questions about her support for @entity6 , in order to shift $ 1 million into @entity0 's race in @entity1			1
ironically , @entity0 could have become the next victim of the ' did she or did n't she ' vote for @entity6 conundrum that has plagued @entity56 's @entity55 if she had n't admitted her support for @entity6 today			1
@entity0 is hardly alone in her attempt to distance herself from @entity6 , though , whose approval rating is at a career low , according to an @entity146 / @entity11 poll that came out on wednesday			1
@entity148 sen. @entity147 , @entity150 sen. @entity149 , @entity152 sen. @entity151 , @entity154 sen. @entity153 , @entity156 sen. @entity155 and @entity158 sen. @entity157 have all went out of their way to avoid being associated with @entity6 this year as they wage reelection bids			2
@entity151 is the senator who was supposed to appear at a july fundraiser with @entity6 , then cancelled at the last minute to stay in @entity16			2
he claimed at a debate in september that the ' @entity169 when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me			0
' @entity28 candidates bearing @entity6 's party @entity172 are avoiding the president like the plague			1
as a result , @entity6 , who is seen here delivering remarks during a cabinet level meeting at the @entity169 on wednesday , has n't made a single public appearance on behalf of a @entity27 contender this fall another @entity152 @entity3 , gov. @entity181 , is now claiming that he was never a proponent of @entity6 's signature healthcare reform law			1
at a debate earlier this week against @entity18 @entity184 , @entity181 said while talking about health care , ' and again , i 'm not big fan of the @entity188 , i would n't have designed it that ... ' he stopped short of finishing his sentence as he was both interrupted by his opponent and booed by members of the live audience			2
as his @entity18 opponent immediately pointed out on @entity195 after the debate , @entity181 was singing a slightly different tune when the @entity198 ruled in 2012 that the individual mandate portion of @entity188 was constitutional			2
a press release from @entity181 's office includes a direct quote from the governor praising the legislation			0
' more coloradans will benefit when the @entity188 is fully implemented in 2014 , ' he said			0
once considered a rising star of the @entity27 , @entity181 is trailing @entity184 by four points , per a @entity209 poll that came out yesterday			0
the incumbent governor is gaining on @entity184 , who was once ahead by 10 points , but he the race still leans heavily in @entity184 's favor			0
like @entity151 , @entity181 also skipped events with @entity6 when the president was in town this summer			0
he memorably grabbed a beer and shot pool with the president when they bumped into each other at a local bar , however			0
@entity6 won both games .			0

when confronted by a tracker for a @entity18 outfit on wednesday about her vote , @entity0 stayed mum
the same question has tripped up fellow @entity27 @entity28 candidate @entity55 of @entity56
@entity0 said on friday that she did in fact vote for @entity6 in 2008 and 2012
