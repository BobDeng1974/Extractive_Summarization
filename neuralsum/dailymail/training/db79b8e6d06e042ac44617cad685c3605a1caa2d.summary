@entity1 defender @entity0 provided a decent reply when @entity4 supporter @entity3 offered him a sports cars and money to swap the north - west for north @entity8 this week			1
' these days i play for glory , ' said the @entity11			2
as quick witted as it was acerbic , @entity0 ’s @entity12 made his point			2
the landscape has shifted in @entity16 football over the last five years			2
you no longer sign for @entity4 if you want to win the @entity18 any time soon			2
even the ever optimistic @entity19 will find little glory in his own team ’s predicament at the moment , however , as the @entity1 captain does his best to steady a defence currently looking as vulnerable as at any time since @entity27 money eased his club on to an upwards trajectory six years ago			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 failed to deal with the threat of two - goal hero @entity31 @entity11 international @entity0 , pictured with @entity33 's @entity32 , struggled against the @entity34 @entity36 's side have not been at their best during this season 's @entity38 campaign @entity0 reflected on his side 's performance shortly after the final whistle football is cyclical , of course			1
few things at the really top clubs last forever and @entity1 have too many good players in their squad for their current struggles to last			1
having said that , they are currently showing few signs of digging themselves out of a defensive slump that threatens to undermine their whole season			0
@entity1 have tried to pair @entity0 with a number of centre backs during his time at the club but have had little success			1
the likes of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have all been given a chance to hold down a starting berth alongside @entity0 - but have all since moved on to pastures new			2
@entity66 , who sealed a £ 32million move to the @entity68 during the summer transfer window , had expected to bolster @entity1 's defensive options but is yet to impress			1
there are other issues currently afflicting this @entity1 team			1
too many of their marquee players are lacking form			0
they miss a reliable third striker after the departure of @entity80 on the back of his wife ’s homesickness in the summer			0
nevertheless , the sickness that currently drags them down is undoubtedly their work without the ball , their defending			0
even the best attacking teams need a platform on which to work and at the moment @entity1 just do n’t have one			1
@entity1 were as poor as they have been for many years on wednesday night in that area of the field and there would appear to be a self - belief issue			1
confidence – that intangible sporting elixir – can hide a multitude of sins			0
equally , when it leaves you it can turn very good players in to shadows of themselves			0
look , for example , at the two first half goals conceded by @entity108 ’s team here			0
@entity0 looked dejected after his side loss 2 - 1 against @entity38 opponents @entity33 the @entity1 defender was not happy with the performance of referee @entity113 @entity114 , pictured , and @entity66 have taken it in turns to partner @entity0 the first – a free header from a free - kick – was the type of goal @entity121 defenders would go to the pub and fret about			1
the second , meanwhile , began with a botched clearance from @entity126 and ended with a run from @entity33 forward @entity31 that was just too well - timed for the @entity1 left - back ’s malfunctioning colleagues to do anything about			1
there were other horror moments , too			0
between his two goals , @entity31 raced clear on @entity134 with far too much ease			1
on that occasion he was let down by a poor first touch and a shot pulled across goal and wide			0
then , shortly after @entity33 ’s second goal the talented @entity33 midfielder @entity140 turned away from @entity142 so effortlessly that it was embarrassing			1
luckily for @entity1 , he could n’t supplement that act with a pass of similar quality			1
let ’s not be too hard on @entity60			0
the @entity1 midfielder has had a tough week and scored a sublime free - kick equaliser early in the piece			1
his subsequent sending off – as deserved as it was – was simply born of frustration			0
former @entity153 defender @entity66 has failed to live up to his £ 32million price tag @entity3 took to @entity12 on tuesday to ask @entity0 if he would join his beloved @entity4 @entity3 then joked he had withdrawn his offer after the @entity1 star 's performance against @entity33 @entity1 lost their discipline here			1
despite their numerical disadvantage , they could have chased this game down			0
they had enough quality left on the field			0
there is a distinct lack of joy about this team at the moment , though , and , it must be said , their manager is showing few signs of finding answers			0
we have all watched this group of players often enough over the recent months and years to know what they are really capable of			0
they can be a pretty fearsome , destructive force			0
at the moment , though , they look vulnerable and fretful and it is surprising			0
certainly across the back it would help if @entity36 could field a settled back four and in particular a regular central partnership			2
injuries to summer signing @entity66 – back on the bench against @entity33 – and @entity184 have deprived him of that option , though , and for now he must muddle on			2
the @entity38 looks beyond @entity1 already			2
if things do n’t improve soon , the @entity18 will follow suit by the time the @entity189 trees go up			0
@entity190 defends @entity1 's discipline			1

@entity1 's defence failed to deal with the threat of @entity33 star @entity31
@entity36 's side lost 2 - 1 against the @entity34 outfit at the @entity68
@entity1 's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages are *extremely* slim
@entity202 and @entity142 were sent off against @entity33
