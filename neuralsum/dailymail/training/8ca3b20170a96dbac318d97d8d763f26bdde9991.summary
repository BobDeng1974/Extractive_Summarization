@entity1 attack could instantly cripple defence and infrastructure systems @entity5 has the capability to deliver on its threats to carry out a nuclear electromagnetic pulse attack on the @entity9 , it has been claimed			1
dr @entity10 , executive director of the @entity11 on @entity12 and @entity13 , has reportedly seen a long - suppressed government report that concludes @entity5 is capable of using an @entity16 rocket to carry out an attack on the @entity9			1
he says the @entity9 would be particularly vulnerable to such an attack , as any rocket from @entity5 is likely to travel over the @entity20 and approach from the south - something @entity9 missile defences would apparently be powerless to stop			1
fears : the leaked @entity26 report allegedly claims that @entity5 's communist leader @entity27 ( pictured ) has already successfully practiced an electromagnetic pulse attack on the @entity9 launch : dr @entity10 claims to have seen a long - suppressed government report that concludes @entity5 is capable of using an @entity16 rocket ( pictured ) to carry out an electromagnetic pulse attack on the @entity9 dr @entity10 made the claims in an interview with the @entity37 website , in which he was quoted as saying : ' @entity38 are seeing what they can get away with ... it shows that @entity41 is planning something big against the @entity9 ' dr @entity10 's @entity11 on @entity12 and @entity13 advises @entity43 on matters of defence , and he was also formerly the head of the congressionally - mandated @entity47 , which looked into the threat of electromagnetic pulse attacks			1
he told the website that he had seen a long - suppressed report prepared by the @entity26 for the @entity52 that apparently concludes that the best defence the @entity9 had against a @entity5 attack would be to destroy the rocket on the launch pad			0
threat : dr @entity10 was quoted as saying @entity27 is seeing what he can get away with			0
' it shows that @entity41 is planning something big against the @entity9 , ' he added this is due to the @entity9 having ' no early warning radars or interceptors ' to stop a missile from the south , and because the the country also lacks adequate defenses on its east coast , dr @entity10 said			1
an electromagnetic pulse attack involves a nuclear warhead being detonated hundreds of miles above the earth 's surface , with the resulting burst of energy disrupting or destroying all electronic devices - including communications , navigation and sensor systems - in the affected area			0
such an attack on the @entity9 would cripple the country 's defence systems , not to mention cause chaos in any scenario where an electronic device is required - including road , sea and air transport , government and civilian communications and , of course , the throughout entire economic sector			2
the leaked @entity26 report allegedly claims that @entity5 's leader @entity27 already successfully practiced an electromagnetic pulse attack on the @entity9 in early 2013			2
allegations : dr @entity10 's claims come after months of insistence from the administration of @entity9 president @entity100 that @entity5 still did not have the capability to attack the @entity9 or its allies with nuclear weapons in spring of that year , tensions on the @entity105 dramatically increased , thanks to @entity5 's repeat threats of war - including releasing videos depicting a nuclear attack on @entity111			1
dr @entity10 said the @entity26 report was commissioned as a result of these threats			0
he also said that in december 2012 a @entity5 satellite was tracked above central and eastern @entity9 , and could have caused nationwide destruction had it been fitted with a nuclear warhead			0
dr @entity10 's claims come months of insistence from the @entity100 administration that @entity5 still did not have the capability to attack the @entity9 or its allies with nuclear weapons			2
