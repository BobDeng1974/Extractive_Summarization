a young mother told she was ' too young ' for cancer is now fighting for her life after a delay in diagnosis allowed the disease to spread around her body			1
@entity7 , 27 , now faces a double mastectomy if she is to see her young daughter grow up			1
the 27 - year - old , of @entity11 , @entity12 , has already begun chemotherapy treatment to beat the cancer , and has to wear a wig after losing her hair			1
she is now urging other young women to be aware of the disease - and believes they should demand further tests from doctors who dismiss their concerns due to age			1
experts say rates of breast cancer have more than doubled in the last 30 years , blaming the rise on lifestyle factors such as obesity , alcohol consumption and lack of exercise			2
however it is known that genetics also play a big role			0
@entity7 was told she was too young for breast cancer when she found a lump in may 2014			1
now , the 27 - year - old , with daughter @entity36 , faces a double mastectomy to save her life after being diagnosed ms @entity7 is currently undergoing chemotherapy to beat the cancer , which has spread to her lymph nodes			1
she is pictured in hospital ( left and right ) receiving treatment and wearing a wig as it causes hair loss when ms @entity7 first went to the @entity48 , she was referred for an ultrasound test but doctors said the lump was due to hormones			1
six months later the lump was visible , her nipple was inverted , and she was diagnosed with stage three cancer			1
she is pictured with her partner @entity56 , 29 and daughter @entity36 when miss @entity7 , a supermarket worker , first noticed the lump in may 2014 , she thought that , at just 26 , she was too young to get breast cancer			1
she only went to the @entity48 after her partner @entity56 , 29 , convinced her to go			0
she said : ' after the first appointment , the doctor recommended that i go to the hospital and get an ultrasound			2
' they reassured that because of my young age , it was probably just fatty tissue and not cancer			2
' they said it was perfectly common			0
' breast cancer is extremely rare in women in their teens or early twenties and uncommon in women under 35			2
after this , age the risk begins to increase , and the majority of women diagnosed are over 50			0
having a family history of breast cancer increases the risk of a woman developing the condition			2
miss @entity7 's mother had been treated for a pre-cancerous breast condition , and has to be monitored by doctors in case it leads to cancer in future			1
the first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast			1
most breast lumps ( 90 per cent ) are n't cancerous , but it 's always best to have them checked by a doctor			0
breast pain is n't usually a symptom of breast cancer			2
source : @entity107 her grandmother also had ovarian cancer , and a women 's risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer is greatly increased she inherits a harmful mutation in the @entity116 gene or the @entity118 gene			1
however , miss @entity7 was discharged after being told the lump had been caused by her hormones , and left the appointment feeling relieved			1
but six months later she found that her lump was not only still there , but had become bigger and more visible			1
she said : ' i got out of the shower and grabbed a hair - band to tie my hair up when i stopped in my tracks			0
' my breast had completely changed			0
the lump had grown so big , it was visible and my nipples looked inverted			1
' fearing the worst , she made an appointment with the gp again and was quickly referred for an emergency appointment to discover if it was cancer			2
after another scan and biopsy on the lump , doctors confirmed that it was cancer and that it had progressed to stage three			1
this meant that the cancer had spread from her breasts and had invaded her lymph nodes			1
she is currently undergoing intensive chemotherapy in preparation for having a double mastectomy			1
now miss @entity7 needs more tests to find out if she is a carrier of the brca gene , which would make her daughter more likely to develop cancer			1
she said : ' i 've told @entity36 that i am sick in a way that she understands			2
i told her that the medicine mummy is taking will make me feel poorly and that my hair would fall out			0
' ' every time i wear my wig , she tells me to take it off because she likes my head without it			0
' she will joke about it every once in a while , saying things like i do n't need need to wash my hair any more			0
' she 's absolutely brilliant			0
i want to make sure i tell her everything and she does n't feel left out or feel she 's done something wrong			0
' breast cancer is extremely rare in women in their teens or early twenties and uncommon in women under 35			2
miss @entity7 was just 26 when she first noticed the lump now , miss @entity7 writes about her experiences on @entity178 , hoping that more young women will get themselves checked regularly			1
she said : ' i 'm disappointed that i was initially dismissed because of my age			0
a more comprehensive test might have shown the lump for what it was			0
' it just shows that you are never too young			0
' you need to keep checking regularly , and do n't accept age as an excuse for a lump			0
if you 're not sure , always get a second opinion			0
' @entity192 research has shown nearly twice as many young women are being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared to 30 years ago			2
a study found that the rate of metastatic breast cancer - which has spread to other parts of the body - rose around two per cent each year between 1976 and 2009 among women aged 25 to 39			1
this is the most dangerous kind , with fewer than one - third of women surviving at least five years after diagnosis			0
study author dr @entity204 said the increased number of cases of the aggressive form of the disease could be linked to the rising rate of obesity as women eat more and exercise less			0
she added that hormonal birth control may play a role			0
in the @entity215 , a 2011 study found one in eight women will now develop breast cancer in their lifetime and the rate is rising			2
scientists blame obesity , alcohol and the growing tendency to delay motherhood for record levels of the disease			0
up to 47,700 women are being diagnosed every year , equal to 130 a day - double the number 30 years ago .			0
