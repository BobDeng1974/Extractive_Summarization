president @entity0 rebuked @entity2 president @entity1 today for not using his influence to stop @entity2 separatists in @entity5 from ' tampering ' with evidence at the site of the @entity10 crash			1
speaking from @entity13 of the @entity14 , the @entity12 president said it 's @entity1 's ' responsibility to compel ' the rebels to cease removing bodies from the area and allow investigators to have ' immediate and full access ' to the site so they can conduct a thorough investigation			1
' that 's the least that we can do			0
that 's the least that decency demands , ' he said			2
the separatists ' behavior begs the question , ' what exactly are they trying to hide ? ' @entity0 asked at one point in his remarks			1
' this is an insult to those who have lost loved ones			0
' @entity0 's solemn statement comes a day after senators on the committees that oversee international affairs criticized him for inadequately responding to the ongoing violence in @entity5			1
the president has also been pilloried for devoting just 40 seconds of a 16 minute transportation speech on the day of the @entity48 crash to the tragedy and for spending his evening attending @entity51 fundraisers while his national security team handled the the @entity12 's response			1
responding to a statement from @entity1 yesterday in which he publicly threw his support behind an international investigation into the downing of the plane , @entity0 said the @entity2 leader 's words ' have to be supported by actions			1
' ' time is of the essence , ' @entity0 said			2
' families deserve to be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity			0
' ' my preference continues to be finding a diplomatic resolution within @entity5 , ' he noted			2
' i believe that can still happen			0
' but if @entity2 keeps supporting the separatists , he said , it ' will only further isolate itself from the international community , and the costs for its behavior ' will only continue to increase			1
' @entity0 did not elaborate on what those costs would be , however			1
the immediate concern for world leaders , he said , is investigating the crash			0
the president said he 'd spoken to many world leaders throughout the last four days since @entity109 was shot down by @entity111 surface - to - air missiles , killing 298 people , and ' all of them remain in a state of shock ' as well as ' outrage			0
' ' we have to make sure that the truth is out and that accountability exists , ' the @entity12 president said			1
president @entity0 signed an executive order baring the federal government and its contracting agencies from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity this morning before giving remarks on the situation in @entity5 over the weekend images emerged of crash victims in body bags baking in the sun on the side of the road			1
the bodies were later tossed into dirty trucks and transported to a train station where they were supposed to be loaded into a refrigerated car and shipped to a rebel - controlled town 50 miles away			0
the cooling system in the car was reportedly not working overnight , however , and the bodies have been allowed to rot			0
yesterday @entity12 secretary of state @entity145 confirmed reports of ' drunken separatist soldiers unceremoniously piling bodies into trucks , removing both bodies , as well as evidence , from the site			2
' ' what 's happening is really grotesque			0
and it is contrary to everything that president @entity1 and @entity2 said that they would do , ' @entity145 said			1
' this is the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations , ' @entity0 said today			2
ranking @entity164 member on the @entity165 @entity162 called the situation ' incredibly tragic			0
' ' what is also tragic is the response that the @entity169 has given up until this point , ' @entity162 , a @entity164 , told @entity172 host @entity171			0
' and in many ways , because of that cautious response , @entity2 has continued to foment all the problems that they 've created in @entity5			1
' @entity178 chairman @entity177 , a @entity179 , also expressed discontent with @entity0 's handing of @entity1 since the @entity2 - backed separatists invaded @entity5 this spring			1
' clearly president @entity1 has created the set of circumstances and has supplied the resources … to the rebels so that this tragedy could take place , ' @entity177 told @entity171 yesterday , according to @entity190			2
' for me , i think the @entity169 , including the [ @entity12 ] , has to have a far more significant response than we ’ve seen to date			2
' former secretary of state @entity194 said during a @entity195 and a this afternoon that she agrees with the president 's statements this morning but indicated that she thinks the @entity12 should be sending a stronger message to @entity1			1
' we should work to bring our @entity201 allies together with us on tougher sanctions that would make it clear to @entity1 that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior and we should encourage @entity201 to start immediately to make sure they are less dependent on @entity2 energy so they are not intimidated , ' she said			1
' finally , i would like to see more support given to the @entity210 to guard their borders and to protect themselves			0
' in a statement of his own , @entity1 accused his critics yesterday of politicizing the plane crash while simultaneously placing the blame on @entity5 for inciting the attack			1
' nobody should and has no right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals , ' @entity1 said in a televised address			2
' we repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and sit down at the negotiating table			0
i can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed on june 28 in eastern @entity5 , this tragedy would n’t have happened			0
' today @entity210 prime minister @entity230 pointed the finger back at @entity1 , claiming his country is aligned with the ' devil			0
' ' i do not expect anything from the @entity2 government			0
they supplied weapons , they sent in fighters			0
@entity1 should understand that it 's enough already , ' @entity230 said			2
' this is not a conflict between @entity5 and @entity2			1
it is an international conflict			0
' @entity2 is on the dark side , on the side of the devil , ' he claimed			0
@entity248 prime minister @entity247 today called the plane crash an ' appalling tragedy ' and said he hoped @entity1 would ' use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending @entity2 's support for the separatists			1

@entity1 needs to compel separatists to allow investigators to have ' immediate and full access ' to the site @entity0 said
' that 's the least that we can do . that 's the least that dignity demands '
@entity0 said that @entity2 would face increased costs if it did *n't* start *cooperating*
the president 's statement follows critical remarks from @entity274 on his *insufficient* response to violence in the @entity5
@entity194 said the @entity12 should beef up sanctions on @entity2
