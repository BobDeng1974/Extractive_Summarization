' ' even right at the end , when he seemingly was n’t consciously there , the one thing that was still always on his mind - and that ’s what got at me the worst - he was still thinking about that night			0
' @entity39 reported his father 's complaint of alleged mistreatment at @entity59 to @entity60 on november 27 , 2014			2
however , it is not being investigated by police because they claim there is a lack of evidence and perhaps mr @entity12 was a danger to himself			2
the detailed complaint paints a traumatic picture of mr @entity12 's brief stay at @entity38 after he was transferred from @entity70 on november 18 , 2014 , with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation			1
@entity12 's 23 - year - old son @entity39 , seen here with a photo of his father , told @entity46 about his father 's upsetting exerpience mr @entity12 's mother @entity78 , who went by the stage name @entity2 , was well - known for her role as @entity81 in the @entity4 radio serial @entity82 which aired from 1949 - 76 following instructions from his doctors to drink a lot of water because he 'd been given a contrast medium to make his lungs stand out on x-rays , mr @entity12 called out for a drink after he was allegedly given no attention for three hours since his son @entity39 had left the hospital at 6pm			1
' @entity94 said “ it ’s been a long day ” , he said “ why do n’t you go home and come back tomorrow ”			0
we felt uncomfortable but i made it clear to the staff - and i ’m not a fluent @entity7 speaker but i speak well - i said to the staff , and i know they understood me , that if there are issues i live three minutes down the road and you have my number on record , ' @entity39 explained			2
it emerged the father - of - three 's requests for water , sleeping pills and for someone to change his iv drip reportedly went unanswered for hours on end			1
mr @entity12 had a brief stay at @entity38 after he was transferred from @entity70 on november 18 , 2014 , with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation at 9:30pm , mr @entity12 climbed out of his bed and walked to the nurses ' station where he was allegedly ignored by a male nurse on duty			1
according to his complaint to police , mr @entity12 then tried to walk out of the ward to find help elsewhere but was stopped by the male nurse and three security guards who took him back to his bed			1
the male nurse then allegedly tied him to the bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort			1
' @entity94 's energy levels were n't high			0
the nurse seemed to already have prepared the bed sheets , he found himself being bound to the bed by bed sheets			0
' so he ’s tied up , he ’s shouting out for more help despite the fact that the ones that are meant to help him are the ones that did it			0
the main concern is the water and he wants @entity149 changed , ' @entity39 said			0
in his complaint , mr @entity12 reports suffering an agonising back spasm while trying to free himself			1
it was not until 11:30pm that he claims he was finally given water by the male nurse			2
however , because his arms were tied the nurse allegedly force - fed mr @entity12 causing him to choke			1
' he held the jug above my father 's head and started pouring			0
the water was hot - not too hot that it might burn him - but the guy just kept pouring with no attempt to give him sips			0
@entity94 had to actually turn his head to stop it			0
' mr @entity12 was born in @entity19 in 1935 but lived in @entity20 and @entity21 before retiring in @entity7 in 1998 an attempt to escape the restraints saw mr @entity12 get as far as the car park at around 7:30am the next morning before he was hauled back to his bed			1
mr @entity12 's son @entity39 then found him in distress after a different nurse began their shift and agreed to call to ask him to come to the hospital			1
' next thing in the morning , i wake up to a phone call at 9am - it ’s my dad saying “ they tied me up to the bed , get over here ” , ' @entity39 said			2
' i was bloody shocked and i rode over there , and there he is lying in bed , slightly upright and i looked down on the bed and there were indeed some knots tied into extra sheets			0
there were two either side for the arms and one bed sheet at the end used to hold his feet down			0
' @entity39 spoke to his father 's doctor about what happened			0
' he was quite shocked but not shocked enough			0
he had a look in his eye and even later on said " honestly i should n't say this but this hospital has too many patients and not enough staff to take care of them " , ' @entity39 recalled			0
@entity39 then reportedly met @entity38 ’s deputy director @entity203 , international department head nurse ms @entity204 and two other nurses on january 29 where any wrongdoing was denied			1
@entity12 spent one night at @entity59 last year when the incident is alleged to have occurred when mr @entity12 died in january he was still upset about what had allegedly happened to him at the hospital mr @entity12 complained that a male nurse tied him to a bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort but ms @entity204 admitted that mr @entity12 had been restrained			1
the hospital claimed they tried to call @entity39 , but he says he received no calls from them that night			0
' i find the hospital 's explanation and reasoning behind what happened to be flimsy at best , ' @entity39 told the @entity224 , the local paper which first reported mr. @entity12 's ordeal			2
@entity46 has contacted @entity226 for comment			0
@entity39 admits he is ' angry ' about what happened to his father			0
mr @entity12 believed the back pain he suffered in his last months was caused by the hospital experience , but @entity39 concedes it was likely caused by the colon cancer that was already spread around his body			1
' it was just sad because what if that night did n't happen ? the pain would have manifested anyway and maybe the first hospital would have done more tests and found the cancer - he still would have been stage four and he still would have died , but we could have informed more family and they would have had more time to visit him , ' @entity39 said			2
it was a humiliating experience for a man who had spent the later years of his life fighting perceived injustices , with video documentaries on his own @entity249 channel			0
mr @entity12 's own father was @entity251 , a celebrated violinist and leader of the @entity253			2
his mother @entity78 , who went by the stage name @entity2 , was well - known for her role as @entity81 in the @entity4 radio serial @entity82 which aired from 1949 - 76			0
