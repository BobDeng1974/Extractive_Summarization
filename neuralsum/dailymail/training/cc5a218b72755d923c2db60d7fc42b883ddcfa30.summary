money worries and a ' @entity1 ideal ' of relationships are among the reasons counselling service @entity4 expects a spike in calls in the new year			1
some couples and families will have had a ' really difficult time ' over the festive period , with so much expectation to have a great @entity12 , and for some people issues ' add up and become this big pressure cooker that just explodes '			1
calls to @entity4 's national phone line rose by 53 per cent on the first monday of january 2014 compared with the first monday of december 2013 , with appointment bookings increasing by 86 per cent			1
couples feel pressured by ' perfect ' relationships depicted by @entity1 , says counsellor @entity20 @entity20 , a relationships counsellor at @entity4 , said january is ' a time of reflection ' which many see as an opportunity for a new start			1
' people are thinking about their lives , their relationships , and they kind of want to go into the new year fresh and they do n't want to bring in all the burdens of the past year and the past few years if the relationship has n't been going that well			2
' so i think we see quite a high volume of calls in january due to that			1
it 's kind of like , you have three choices : you either stay as things are , you leave the relationship or you try and change			0
and a lot of people do opt to try and change and work things out , ' she said			0
ms @entity20 said that along with other occasions such as @entity48 and anniversaries , @entity12 can bring a lot of expectation and pressure			1
' people want to have this great family time and sometimes it 's just not like that			2
so it can be quite difficult , with particularly money worries			1
' that 's like the highest concern at the moment for people that have been surveyed in @entity4 surveys			0
i think 40 per cent of people are worried about money and not being able to buy the right presents , having big arguments within families on christmas day			1
@entity4 received 53 per cent more calls than the previous month from unhappy couples in january 2014 ' the pressure on couples to provide for children , if they want to get them the latest toy that 's out or the latest computer games - things are expensive			1
' and inviting people round and making big dinners , all of that costs money			2
and that 's just an extra pressure on the relationship when there 's maybe stuff that 's going on already for them			2
' meanwhile , following the fortunes of happy celebrity couples can have a detrimental effect on our own relationships			2
ms @entity20 said she believes the ' @entity1 ideal ' of having a perfect relationship , a perfect family , and a perfect @entity12 , is ' really damaging ' as it causes people to question their own situations			1
' i think in society , in glossy magazines and on tv , we 're kind of expected to have this @entity1 ideal of relationships			2
' so when they have an argument it 's the @entity110 , when actually research shows that arguments are healthy			0
obviously if you 're arguing all the time that 's difficult , but i think the ratio is one in five			2
' if you 're having five positive interactions to one difficult interaction you 've got a healthy relationship			0
it 's important to have arguments because that shows that you 're still two individual people , ' she said			0
ms @entity20 said sometimes people think that they ' should be having sex all the time ' , adding : ' unfortunately , sometimes we 're just too busy , we 're just tired , it does fall off the agenda			2
but that does n't mean that your relationship is doomed			0
' the counsellor said people should recognise a healthy relationship			0
' sometimes people do panic a little bit because they 're given all of these messages , from the media and from society , that their relationship should be a certain way , when actually what they 've got is really normal and actually really healthy , ' she said			0
for 40 per cent , fears about financial insecurity and money worries are enough to destroy a marriage ms @entity20 added : ' so i think the whole idea of never arguing , never fighting , having this perfect idea of @entity12 , perfect idea of a relationship , perfect idea of a family , is really damaging , because then whenever anything goes wrong , it 's like , ' well this is n't how it 's supposed to be '			1
' @entity156 , chief executive of @entity4 , said : ' january is always very busy for @entity4			2
sadly many couples and families face a tough time over @entity12 as people spend concentrated time together and that can bring any underlying issues bubbling to the surface			1
' also @entity164 is a time when many of us naturally assess how life is going and this can make people think about how their relationships are faring			1
' the high number of calls we receive in january suggests that many people are considering what they want from their relationships and what their next steps will be			1
contacting @entity4 is a positive step - it can be the first stage in working out what 's best for your relationships			0
' earlier this year , the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) said the number of divorces in @entity187 and @entity188 in 2012 was 118,140 , an increase of 0.5 per cent since 2011 , when there were 117,558 divorces			0
the number of divorces in 2012 was highest among men and women aged 40 to 44			0
for those married in 1972 , 22 per cent of marriages had ended in divorce by their 15th wedding anniversary , whereas for those married in 1997 , almost a third of marriages had ended by this time , according to the @entity184			1
in 2012 , 10.8 people divorced per thousand married population , a decrease of 19 per cent compared with 13.3 per cent in 2002			0
@entity206 , a divorce lawyer at @entity207 , said : ' any tensions or issues in a relationship are likely to come to the forefront in the lead up to @entity164			0
' there is a lot of pressure on families over the festive season to ensure that everything is perfect so if there are weaknesses in a relationship they can become apparent very quickly , despite the best intentions of everyone involved			0
' we are often contacted by clients both as the @entity164 approaches and particularly after who decide that the tension and the arguing has just gone on for too long			0
' @entity231 is a natural time for people to assess their lives and relationships can come under more scrutiny			1
especially if one has been putting in a lot more effort that the other to fix the problems in the relationship			0
