late - sleeping @entity1 fans found out the hard way that if you snooze , you lose - literally - when @entity5 's complete stock of @entity1 merchandise sold out almost immediately early sunday morning			1
the 250 - piece collaboration - which included clothing , accessories , and homeware from the designer at @entity5 's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside @entity5 stores before they opened			2
now officially sold out by the retailer , pieces from the diffusion line have popped up on @entity20 - but those cruising the bidding site should n't expect to see the same original low prices paid by @entity5 customers			1
fast fashion gets faster : @entity1 's lower - priced collection for @entity5 sold out almost immediately online and in stores ; customers re-selling this $ 34 maxi dress were netting bids over $ 200 pricey prints : pieces like this @entity1 bag , left , and hammock , right were quickly available at major mark - ups online , though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush luckily for more patient shoppers who are looking for a second shot at buying from the preppy line , the outrageously - priced items that first became available on @entity20 have since been joined by more reasonably - priced pieces			1
@entity44 re-sellers started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price , including a $ 150 hammock for $ 799 and a $ 34 maxi dress for $ 202.50			1
a $ 30 tote bag was posted with a buy it now asking price of $ 300			0
however , within 24 hours , many more sold - out items became available on @entity20 for under $ 100 , including a $ 9.99 makeup bag that sold for $ 19.99 and a $ 15 headband that sold for $ 30			1
bait for the belles : ' the things @entity60 girls do for @ @entity61 [ sic ] , ' wrote customer @entity62 of the line outside a @entity64 , @entity66 @entity5 store designer demand : shopper @entity68 posted this picture of a cleared - out @entity5 store on sunday , writing that the racks were empty within five minutes the thousands of pieces available on @entity20 are n't just from buyers unhappy with their purchases , however			1
in fact , many re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of re-selling them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers , who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for ' true ' fans of the brand			0
' there 's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on @entity20 , ' one woman wrote on @entity94			0
another said : ' the people who bought hoards of # @entity61 products just to resell them online are ( literally ) the reason we ca n't have nice things			0
[ sic ] ' other customers also complained of problems using @entity5 's website on sunday morning ; ' extreme traffic ' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases			2
@entity110 ladies love @entity111 : celebrities including ( l to @entity114 ) @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 all wore @entity1 for @entity5 dresses to the line 's launch party but though frustrated fans criticized @entity5 for poor planning and a lack of bulk - buying policies , these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store 's past designer collaborations			0
the highly - anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads , lookbooks and celebrity - packed parties , resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on - sale dates to their calendars			0
in 2011 , @entity141 's collaboration with @entity5 crashed the website as well , and collections from @entity144 , 3.1 @entity145 , and @entity146 all saw marked - up resell value on @entity20 after selling out in stores			2
while @entity5 wo n't be restocking the limited - edition collection , customers who refuse to shell out more than the retail value still have a shot at scoring @entity1 pieces at low prices : @entity5 has instated a 14 - day return policy for the line , meaning rejected items will start popping back up in stores within the next two weeks .			0

the designer diffusion line went on sale sunday morning but was nearly sold out online before noon , with stores selling out minutes after opening
re-sellers initially tried to *unload* merchandise at crazy prices including $ 799 for a $ 150 hammock ; now thousands of pieces are available on @entity20 with smaller markups
