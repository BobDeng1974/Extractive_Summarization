@entity20 's , which achieved a world record sales total when it auctioned the rest of the @entity17 's jewels in 1987 , hopes that the new collection will be similarly well received			2
' @entity103 landmark sale of the jewels of the @entity17 remained the most valuable single - owner jewellery sale for almost a quarter of a century and inaugurated a new era in the jewellery auction market , ' explained @entity108 , chairman of @entity20 's jewellery division in @entity110 and the @entity111			1
' three years ago , we witnessed the continuing fascination for this collection when 20 pieces from the original sale reappeared at auction in @entity20 's @entity118 and established new price levels			2
' we are delighted to present this further selection of attractive jewels and precious objects , which shed light on the @entity30 's life , and what has been called the greatest love story of the 20th century			0
' the sale of 459 lots will be held in two sessions beginning at 10am and again at 2pm			0
enduring : after refusing to give mrs @entity17 up , the former @entity18 abdicated in favour of his brother few could have imagined , as the 20th century dawned , that an @entity4 socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the @entity72 - and the @entity10 - has ever faced			2
but @entity17 was no ordinary socialite and her future husband @entity18 , no ordinary king			0
the pair met in january 1934 and twice - divorced @entity17 and the then @entity18 swiftly fell in love			0
at first the relationship raised few concerns , @entity18 was notorious for his affairs with society ladies , but that all changed when @entity143 died on the 20th january 1936			0
when , the next day , the new king - emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of @entity17 , it became clear that he intended to marry her			0
this precipitated a crisis , firstly because the political establishment considered a twice - divorced woman an unsuitable consort , and secondly , because @entity18 was now head of the @entity155 , which at the time , did not allow marriages between divorcees			0
@entity18 suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented @entity17 becoming @entity159 , but the prime ministers of the @entity10 , @entity161 and @entity162 rejected the plan			0
by early december , the true nature of @entity17 's relationship with the @entity18 had become public knowledge and she fled the country			0
despite attempts by @entity17 to get him to reconsider , on the 13th december 1936 , @entity18 abdicated and was succeeded by his brother , @entity169 the couple eventually married , a month after @entity17 ' second divorce was granted , on the 3rd june 1937 in the south of @entity173			0
although @entity18 had been created the @entity30 by his brother and was entitled to the style ' @entity177 ' , his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as ' @entity179			0
' treasured : among the items on sale is a frame given to the @entity30 by his great grandmother , @entity73			1
