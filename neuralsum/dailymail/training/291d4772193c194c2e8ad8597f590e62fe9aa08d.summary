the schoolgirl , now grown up with children , says she is so haunted by memories of the pain she caused that she now suffers from ' reverse post traumatic stress disorder '			1
speaking on condition of anonymity , the woman says she picked on one girl , called ' @entity21 ' , with such venom that she moved schools to begin a new life			1
but @entity25 apparently never recovered from the torment and later committed suicide in high school - a fact the bully only learned years later when trying to track her down to apologise			1
' there are no words to describe how monstrous i was , ' she told @entity35 , agony aunt for @entity37 website @entity38			0
' if i inflicted half as much physical assault in my adulthood as i did to her as a teen , i would be locked up for a very long time			1
' she says she only realised the effects she must have had on her victims when her daughter , who she had aged 19 , ' experienced some minor bullying ' at school			1
she saw how ' tormented ' her daughter was and realised what she did to her classmates were ' way worse '			1
so she made it her ' mission ' to track down all the people she bullied in a bid to make amends for the pain she caused them			2
it was a task made easier by the proliferation of social media such as @entity60 and @entity61			0
she said most responded to her contrition ' with forgiveness ' , she would never be able to say sorry to the person who deserved it most - because she had killed herself having moved to a new school			2
' i have very good reasons to believe that she switched schools because of me , ' she said			2
' i have nightmares about what i did to her - it 's like reverse ptsd where i remember the awful things i 've done to others			0
' she managed to get hold of @entity25 's mother 's email address but is yet to find the ' guts ' to make contact			1
' what would i say , ' she added			0
' i know this sounds gutless but i 'm also scared of any legal consequences i might face after i own up to my actions			0
