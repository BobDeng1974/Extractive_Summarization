@entity2 ’s @entity1 future should be resolved this week after he arrived back into the country from the @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity2 , who served as first - team coach at @entity7 under @entity8 last season , has finished his punditry duties with the @entity11 and flew back into @entity12 on monday afternoon			1
he will now return to @entity13 and it is understood that he will have discussions in the coming days with senior officials at the @entity17 at @entity17 to clarify whether there will be a role for him at @entity7 under new manager @entity20			2
a @entity1 insider was last week keen to stress that the ‘ @entity34 ’ are ‘ part of the fabric of the football club ’ and but @entity2 is still to be informed what role , if any at all , that the club can find for him following the exit of @entity8			1
@entity2 may exit as the club look to make a break with the dismal campaign endured by @entity8 , with @entity41 having already brought in @entity42 as his assistant coach , although it could yet be that @entity1 find a reduced role for the former @entity47 international in the academy			1
@entity49 , meanwhile , will remain with the club , as @entity51 first revealed last week			0
end of an era : @entity2 was part of the unsuccessful team which led @entity1 under @entity8 last season one of the graduates of the class of 1992 , @entity49 is contracted with the club and works alongside @entity59 with the under - 21 team and manages the under - 19 side in the @entity62			1
it is believed that he is set to continue in that position next season			0
@entity51 understands that @entity49 has made no indication to the club that he would be unwilling to continue in his role with a highly - placed source saying : ‘ @entity57 are very important to @entity1			0
‘ @entity49 is a member of staff at the club , he has a position here and he is working with @entity59 , who will remain at the club			0
’ @entity49 was promoted to the first - team fold following the sacking of @entity8 in april as he assisted close friend @entity77 after the @entity78 assumed managerial responsibilities at @entity7			2
once @entity41 was handed the job , there were suspicions that the @entity87 may look to weed out the influence of the @entity34 of ‘ 92 to make way for his own backroom staff but with @entity77 on board as assistant , the new manager has indicated his desire to maintain a link with @entity1 ’s heritage			0
class of 92 : @entity2 remained on the coaching staff with other famous faces including @entity96 and @entity49 have a word : @entity2 offers some guidance to @entity77 , who took charge of @entity1 after @entity8 was axed			0

@entity2 has returned to @entity47 for talks with @entity1 .
@entity2 was first - team coach under @entity8 last season .
@entity2 will speak with senior officials to discover if he will work under @entity20 .
@entity2 may exit as the club look after the dismal campaign endured by @entity8 .
