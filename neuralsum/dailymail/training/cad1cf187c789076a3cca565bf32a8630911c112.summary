by @entity0 last updated at 12:16 pm on 16th september 2011 @entity1 said he is ' appalled ' and is ' on the case ' after @entity4 singer @entity3 said she was subject to alleged racial abuse at a @entity7 airport			1
the @entity7 mayor tweeted the 32 - year - old after she launched into an angry @entity11 tirade against @entity12 following the alleged incident at passport control at one of the capital 's airports			1
he wrote : ' heard about the treatment you received at a @entity12 airport			1
want you to know this is not typical			2
i ’m appalled & i ’m on the case			2
' on the case : @entity7 mayor @entity1 said he is ' appalled ' at the treatment @entity4 singer @entity3 , right , allegedly received at a @entity7 airport this week the mayor has now written to @entity29 , chief executive of the @entity30 , urging him to remind staff they are ' the face and voice of modern @entity12			1
' @entity3 took to @entity11 claiming she was labelled a ' slave ' by a middle - aged white man as she was travelling home to @entity4 with her two - year - old son @entity38 after performing at @entity39 on the @entity40 over the weekend			1
@entity41 i was alarmed to read press reports about the singer @entity3 ’s bad experience at passport control at a @entity7 airport			1
her main claim was about a member of the public but she also alleges that uniformed staff laughed and left her feeling humiliated			2
can i take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all @entity30 staff that they are the face and voice of modern @entity12 - the first people we encounter when we come home , the first people visitors encounter when they come to our shores			1
it is critical for the success of the 2012 @entity67 and @entity66 next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the @entity12 at its best			1
the @entity67 is a one - off opportunity to reinforce @entity7 ’s reputation for another generation as the best big city in the world			0
it would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned into this opportunity			0
yours ever , @entity1 the incident took place when @entity3 was accused of queue - jumping by a ' red - faced sweaty man ( i use the word man loosely here ) '			1
she went on to say he then called her ' slave ' and declared she was ' probably a disgusting @entity91 '			0
the @entity93 singer explained : ' he called me kunta kinte and ranted and raved some more			2
' the man behind the passport desk laughed , shook his head in agreement i guess , and said " kunta kinte "			0
mr @entity1 wrote in his letter to mr @entity29 that he was ' alarmed ' by the reports of her experience			1
he said : ' can i take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all @entity30 staff that they are the face and voice of modern @entity12 - the first people we encounter when we come home , the first people visitors encounter when they come to our shores			1
' it is critical for the success of the 2012 @entity67 and @entity66 next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the @entity12 at its best			1
' the @entity67 is a one - off opportunity to reinforce @entity7 ’s reputation for another generation as the best big city in the world			0
it would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned into this opportunity			0
' @entity3 tweeted she was furious about the incident and said dozens of bystanders said nothing			1
tricky issue : @entity3 took to her @entity11 page on monday after she was allegedly subjected to racist abuse at a @entity7 airport she wrote : ' all the while the entire line full of people i just sat on a plane with for almost 3hours , over 50 people said nothing			1
' we all no ( sic ) i 'm no saint , so i retaliated			0
not the way i wanted to or how that pig deserved			0
but # 1 my gorgeous baby boy was literally sitting on my hip and # 2 i 'm a believer			0
' @entity3 then brought up the @entity7 riots in august - which were committed by @entity12 people from a range of races , classes and ages			1
behind : @entity3 bought up the @entity7 riots and said the incident had made her believe the @entity12 was ' decades behind progression ' hitting out : the @entity93 singer accused the @entity12 of being ' decades behind in progression ' obviously upset , the @entity163 singer declared the incident had made her believe the @entity12 was ' decades behind progression '			1
she continued : ' i did n't say anything at the time of the riots in @entity7 for a lot of reasons			0
but i am in @entity7 all the time and today i 'm gon na say that the racial issues in the @entity12 are disgusting			2
' its racially decades behind progression because everything is swept under the rug			2
people do n't talk about it			0
people do n't fight about it			0
not mentioning a problem does n't make it go away			0
' rude awakening : @entity3 was queuing at passport control when the alleged incident took place after many fans pointed out @entity4 's on - going racial tensions - which were most recently highlighted during the aftermath of @entity187 , @entity3 acknowledged her home country also had issues			1
she added : ' i bring it up now because as an @entity4 it is abundantly clear that my country has a smorgasbord of disgusting racial problems			2
' we are the poster child for racial inequality even still with a black president			0
but its no secret ! and that i can fight against			0
i can try to prepare and teach my son			0
but you ca n't fight for or against something no one is willing to talk about or even admit exist			0
' anti-racism groups were keen to point out that while racism still exists in some pockets of society , the man 's alleged behaviour was not representational of @entity12 people			2
a spokesman for the @entity217 , the @entity12 ’s leading independent race equality group , told @entity218 : ' it ’s worth noting that we ’re not a multi-racial paradise in the @entity12 but there is a fight back here , and there are lots of ways in which musicians like @entity3 can contribute to that			1
things like the @entity232 music festival in @entity7 – 10,000 people making it clear they are against racism			0
' but i do n’t think we have got a huge amount to learn from @entity4 in terms of the racism that operates over there			2
we are struggling against racism in the same way as people are in the @entity244			0

@entity4 singer accused @entity12 of being ' decades behind progression '
mr @entity1 said he was ' appalled ' and assured @entity3 it was ' not typical '
