' many members of the public are under the illusion that all animal experimentation is vital for human health benefits , whereas this could n’t be further from the truth			0

' unless they wish to be at the bottom of the science pile , these universities need to embrace today 's technological breakthroughs			0
' but the @entity160 refuted claims the research being carried out was unnecessary			0
chief executive , @entity163 , said : ' charities fund projects using animals only when they are satisfied that there is no possible alternative			0
