they must spend their days locked up behind bars , living shoulder to shoulder with murderers , rapists and drug dealers , yet they have committed no crimes			0
meet the desperate mothers , children and babies who have been forced to move into a bleak @entity12 prison alongside their incarcerated relatives after being left homeless by @entity14			1
over five million people saw their homes destroyed when the typhoon hit nine regions in the central @entity12 on november 8 , 2013 , leaving behind a wide swath of destruction			1
the category five storm brought winds of up to 235 miles per hour causing massive landslides and flooding			0
in all some 14 million people were affected , with over 6,000 people losing their lives			1
desperate times : one of the many @entity12 families forced to live in prison with their incarcerated relatives after they were left homeless by @entity14 @entity33 - based photographer @entity32 visited @entity34 in the @entity12 earlier this year to document the unusual situation where large numbers of displaced families have been forced to move in with their incarcerated relatives			1
at @entity34 he was surprised to find women and children walk freely among inmates			0
while most of the inmates claim to be serving time for petty crimes such as theft or drug trafficking , their photo releases reveal many more are actually serving time for more serious crimes			0
he said : ' my assignment was to verify whether families of the inmates were continuing to live inside the destroyed jail , which was a story that journalist , @entity54 had originally broken			1
' leading up to my trip , there was news that access to the jail was restricted and the families had long since relocated			2
' ' the backdrop of a prison as a site for family portraits also presented a surreal and existential take on what could be a fairly straight ahead reportage story			2
' from my distant vantage point in @entity33 , the disaster as it unfolded had become an abstraction in my mind			0
i did n't care to see the work of @entity73 journalists representing a tragedy in the @entity12			1
i wanted to view , process , and relay the experience in my own way			0
' difficult childhood : over five million people were left homeless after the typhoon hit nine regions in the central @entity12 on november 8 , 201 at @entity34 in the @entity12 women and children walk freely among inmates , many of whom are serving long sentences for serious crimes such as rape and murder last refuge : around five million people were made homeless after @entity14 tore across the @entity12 in november last year family ties : a father is pictured with his young daughter at @entity34			1
in all some 14 million people were affected by the typhoon , with over 6,000 people losing their lives bleak : an inmate 's family cell at @entity34 prison			1
the backdrop of a prison as a site for family portraits presented a surreal and existential opportunity for photographer @entity32 roll call : prisoners assemble on the grounds of @entity34 jail in the @entity12 much to his surprise all of the families had continued to live alongside the inmates and wardens			1
he decided to take the portraits in various corners of the prison			2
' the portraits that i am presenting represent a small sampling of the many families that i photographed			2
i did n't have the insight into what the jail had originally looked like			0
' but these newly reconstructed spaces seemed familiar and reminiscent of some of the homes that informal settlers or squatters would often build in various parts of the @entity12			1
' he says that the presence of family members made it difficult to ascertain and comprehend the crimes that the inmates had been accused of			0
' i was told that petty crimes such as robbery and drug trafficking were the main culprits			0
however , upon looking at the makeshift release forms that i had asked each family and inmate to sign , murder and rape were the most prevalent			0
' a working society has sprung up inside the prison , with its own water sanitation , security , and even fruit stands			1
' most report that as dangerous as bringing their families to such a situation is , life on the outside is still worse as the country continues its slow recovery			1
' many inmates inside worry that they may never be able to leave with their families when the outside infrastructure recovers			2
' visually , i was inspired by @entity165 's uncanny book , @entity166			0
although my images do n't hold a candle to that series , it helped organise how i thought of shooting that situation			0
' squalor : photographer @entity32 captured a series of moving family portraits using the grim surroundings of the prison as a backdrop concerns : many inmates at @entity34 worry that they may never be able to leave with their families when the outside infrastructure finally recovers together : an inmate at @entity34 prison stands with his wife who has been given permission to move in with him after her home was destroyed cramped : a tiny space inside @entity34 prison must serve as home for an entire @entity12 family including washing , cooking and sleeping areas a makeshift family kitchen inside one of the cells at @entity34 in the @entity12 where many families have been forced to move in with their jailed relatives though the prison is desolate , it is still equipped with electricity , water purification , security and a sick ward , which is much more than you would find outside of its gates an inmate 's family cell which also serves as a jail shop is seen in one of @entity33 - based photographer @entity32 's poignant images though the prison is desolate , it is still equipped with electricity , water purification , security and a sick ward , which is much more than you would find outside of its gates			1
unfortunately , those staying in the prison are still subject to disciplinary measures			2
' in one family portrait , a boy holds a light bulb upside down			0
as a trope in and out of context , that to me says something about the overall situation			0
' mr @entity32 found the atmosphere in the prison was somewhat relaxed , which he found rather disquieting			2
he believes that there is a clich√© in the media about the resilience of the @entity12 people and spirit			1
' i am not comforted by that statement or the appearance that life seemingly goes on			0
' i am currently contending with what it means to leave that moment and place behind			0
most concretely , the loss of records leaves the judicial process crippled and both the inmates and their families are lost in a type of purgatory or limbo as to what the future holds			2
' ' it is remote , obscure to the media , and impoverished to the extent that improvisation and adaptation emerge in surreal and absurd ways , for example re-purposing a prison as a gated community			2
' at this point , it feels unnecessary for me to simply return as a photographer unless i can enact a change or help someone			0
' the @entity14 typhoon devastated the country 's court system , washing away a large amount of court records forever			1
@entity33 - based photographer @entity32 went to the @entity34 in april this yea , to document the unusual situation where a large number of displaced families have been forced to move in with their incarcerated relatives handwritten notes detailing the prisoner 's crimes			1
the @entity14 typhoon devastated the country 's court system , washing away a large amount of court records forever murderer : an inmate 's rap sheet detailing his crimes and the names of the relatives staying with him inside prison one man mr @entity32 met said due to the loss of court records due to the @entity14 , he feared that the judicial process has been completely crippled and the future of all of the inmates and the livelihoods of their families ' lies lost in limbo			1
even before the disaster , this particular inmate had been residing at @entity34 for over 10 years awaiting a trial			0
the photographer feels that his project @entity309 , he has used the fate of the @entity34 to create a metaphor or a microcosm depicting the humanitarian crisis in the @entity12 .			1

over five million people left homeless after @entity14 struck the @entity12 in november last year
many have no *alternative* but to live in prison alongside their incarcerated relatives and dangerous *criminals*
the prison is equipped with electricity , water purification and a sick ward , and offers families a level of security
