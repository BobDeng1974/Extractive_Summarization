by @entity0 controversial surveillance blimps that can spot a person 340 miles away have been unveiled by military firm @entity3			1
it boasts the project can offer ' 360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time ' - and revealed the @entity8 has already bought two			1
one is being trialled over @entity10 , with the other being kept in ' strategic reserve '			2
the @entity8 is about to begin testing two of the craft over @entity10 , sparking privacy fears			1
' by putting @entity15 in strategic reserve , the @entity8 is giving combatant commanders around the globe the ability to pick up the phone and , in short order , receive this incredible air defense capability in their area of responsibility , said @entity3 's @entity30 , vice president of @entity33 ' @entity32 business area			1
the system is called @entity15 -- or @entity35 -- which is composed of an integrated radar system on two tethered , 80 - yard blimps			2
the blimps fly at altitudes of 10,000 feet above sea level and remain aloft and operational for 30 days , enabling the use of defensive measures against cruise missiles , low - flying manned and unmanned aircraft , and moving surface vehicles such as boats , mobile missile launchers and tanks			1
threats can be detected from as far as 340 miles away			1
how they work : the blimps can ' see ' for 340 miles			1
they are moored to base stations , and offer 360 degree surveillance capabilites			1
they are designed to look for cruise missiles			0
the @entity10 systtem can detect missiles from @entity59 to @entity60 on the coast and as far inland as @entity62 , according to the @entity63			2
@entity3 , which makes the craft , advertises them as useful for 24/7 surveillance			1
' what if there was an affordable way the @entity69 and its allies could always “ see ” the threat , instead of having to hope they had a ship or airplane in the vicinity to detect the threat ? , ' it says on its website			0
' @entity15 , an affordable elevated , persistent over-the - horizon sensor system uses a powerful integrated radar system to detect , track and target a variety of threats , ' @entity3 says			1
@entity83 , as they are now called , are already used to protect @entity69 bases in @entity85 and @entity86			0
they are outfitted with cameras and used to track insurgent and @entity69 troop movements			2
the dirigibles famously snared @entity8 staff seargent @entity91 slaughtering 16 civilians in @entity93 in march 2012			2
old - fashioned : blimps have been around for decades , but they only recently came back into usage by the @entity8 the two blimps work together to identify threats such as missiles entering the nearby area			2
@entity100 showed mr @entity91 returning to the base under what he thought was the cloak of early morning darkness			0
the footage showed him carrying the rifle used to carry out the mass murder			0
the blimps are also used at the @entity69 – @entity111 border to try to catch illegal immigrants , @entity109 noted			0
the army has commissioned defense contractor @entity3 to provide the airships , which will hover at an altitude of about 10,000 feet over the @entity8 's @entity116 , for the multi-year trial run			1
only missiles : the @entity119 insists the aerostats will only be used to search for missiles , but they are already used overseas to monitor insurgent movements will @entity123 be watching : the @entity124 is also concerned the airships will be used to watch people on the ground privacy advocates worry the blimps will also be equipped with high - resolution cameras and radar to track the movements of civilians			1
‘ right now there are no rules , ’ @entity134 , of the @entity124 , told @entity109			0
‘ there 's nothing that bars us from having high - powered cameras monitoring our every public movement			0
’ another @entity124 analyst echoed those thoughts to the @entity63			0
‘ that 's the kind of massive persistent surveillance we 've always been concerned about with drones , ’ said @entity144			0
‘ it 's part of this trend we ’ve seen since 9/11 , which is the turning inward of all these surveillance technologies			0
’ the blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet			0
maker @entity3 boasts the project can offer ' 360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time ' - raising major privacy concerns over the project			1
highly visible : people as far away as @entity161 will be able to see the blimps high above them the @entity8 insisted in a letter to the paper that the aerostats , which can fly for as long as 30 consecutive days , will be the first line of defense against incoming missiles			1
‘ the primary mission ... is to track airborne objects			0
its secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such as vehicles or boats			0
the capability to track surface objects does not extend to individual people			1
’ the government also said that there are currently no plans to put cameras capable of tracking people on the blimps , but it could not rule out doing so in the future			2
as it is currently constructed , the program is expected to cost $ 2.7billion			0
civilians as far away as @entity161 will be able to see them from the ground .			0

blimps can offer ' 360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time '
powerful radar allows them to spot objects 340 miles away
one blimp will hover over @entity8 *property* in @entity10
another being kept in reserve for *emergency* use
maker @entity3 to begin *selling* the blimps
privacy advocates worry they will be fitted with cameras to track individual people 's movements
