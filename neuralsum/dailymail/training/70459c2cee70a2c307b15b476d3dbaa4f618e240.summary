@entity8 detective sgt. @entity7 ( pictured ) , who works in nuisance and abatement , has spent his own time since 2013 working on the cold case of the 1993 homicide of @entity13 @entity13 , 19 , was raped and stabbed to death in her studio apartment on march 23 , 1993			1
her killer has yet to be found though the city had originally paid for a different dna test that cost $ 1,600 , the @entity40 crime lab that processed the test returned the wrong dna to @entity7			1
so when he asked for funds for a second test that cost $ 996 , he was denied and decided to crowdsource			2
the refusal to fund sparked a debate between the @entity49 family , who were disappointed with the lack of funding , and maj. @entity52 , @entity8 's assistant criminal investigations commander , who said the dna test is not always helpful			2
after 32 people donated to the cause in two days , @entity7 had more than $ 1,200			0
he told @entity55 that he wants the excess money to be donated to @entity57			0
when @entity7 could n't get funding for a dna test that might help narrow down the genetic makeup of the killer of @entity49 , he set up a crowdfunding site to raise money			1
he raised $ 1,200 in two days but just hours after @entity55 published an article about the crowdfunding site , @entity8 pulled @entity7 from the cold case			1
@entity52 said , however , that the fundraising had nothing to do with @entity7 's removal and that he was taken of the case after a review of assignments and procedures			0
@entity49 family members are devastated that @entity7 has been taken off @entity13 's ( pictured ) case			2
they believe without him , it will not be solved ' we just want to make sure people stay in their lanes , ' he told @entity55			0
' we have cold case investigators and we want to let them do their job			2
' though @entity7 is not a cold case investigator , in 2011 he helped in the investigation of the 1989 death of a 16 - year - old who was killed by a burglar in 1989			1
a year later he found the killer by matching a bloody palm print left at the scene with prints form an old misdemeanor arrest			0
@entity52 said that without @entity7 investigating the @entity49 homicide , he is unsure if the dna test will be authorized			1
@entity49 family members believe that without @entity7 on the case , it will never be solved , according to @entity98			2
something has to be changed if this is how the police department is going to be run , ' @entity100 , who was 15 when his sister was killed , told @entity98			0
he went on to tell @entity55 that @entity7 was the police officer that gave the family hope that the 22 - year - old case would be solved			1
' ever since @entity7 took over , we had some hope			0
you balance between not getting your hopes up and having hope , and he gave hope , ' he said			0
' if he 's not assigned to the case , i have zero hope that it 'll be solved , zero			0
' @entity7 said that there is no guarantee that the test would confirm the suspect 's identity , but that it would ' narrow the scope down ' to who they 're looking for			2
@entity52 told the @entity55 that the police department wants justice for the family , but they ' want to follow strict and tight processes ' .			0
