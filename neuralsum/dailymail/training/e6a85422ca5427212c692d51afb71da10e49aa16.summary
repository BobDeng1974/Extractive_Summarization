by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 13 october 2013 it used to be regarded as a national trait that set the @entity3 apart from more emotional nationalities			1
but the stiff upper lip could be a thing of the past , it was claimed yesterday			0
the ability of the @entity3 to remain stoical and visibly unmoved under pressure has been replaced by a tendency to show off our emotions in public			1
the outpouring of emotion over the death of princess @entity18 and watching footballers such as @entity20 and @entity21 cry on the pitch has given us licence to display our emotions for all to see , a survey suggested			2
the research , commissioned by the think tank @entity25 , asked 2,360 people which qualities summed up the concept of being @entity3 , and which were outdated			1
fifty - one per cent of those questioned think the stiff upper lip is an ‘ outdated stereotype ’ , while other familiar characteristics - a fondness for queuing , apologising and talking about the weather - are all still well ingrained into the @entity3 mind set			1
seventy per cent of those polled said the @entity3 sense of humour as a national attribute , while the vast majority chose talking about the weather as the most quintessentially @entity3 trait			1
sixty - nine per cent said the @entity3 were happy to queue and wait their turn , and 60 per cent described ‘ saying sorry unnecessarily ’ was a national trait			1
@entity25 , which deals with ‘ identity and integration ’ , commissioned the @entity49 poll ahead of a @entity50 , which it will co-host with another think tank , the @entity53 , in @entity54 this weekend			0
@entity55 , director of @entity25 , said : ‘ from @entity58 ’s tears to the public reaction to princess @entity18 ’s death ... people are more happy to wear their heart on their sleeves			0
' the @entity63 that we ’ve now got is still proud of tradition , such as @entity66 , but is n’t as emotionally repressed and buttoned up as it was in the past			0
’ more than half of those surveyed said that being happy to wait in a queue was an @entity3 trait he continued : ‘ this research shows that many of the images of what sums up being @entity3 still ring true for most people - that we talk about the weather , are happy to queue and are proud of our distinctive sense of humour , but do say sorry too much			1
‘ but the @entity3 also feel that we have become less buttoned up			2
‘ after the chilly , stiff upper lip world of @entity84 and @entity85 , this research shows that we do n’t see being emotionally repressed as a valuable part of our national character			0
’ mr @entity88 added : ‘ we hope to put to bed the equally outdated idea that @entity63 is something we ca n’t really talk about			0
' there is much to be proud of in @entity3 history and culture , comedy and sport			2
we need to ditch the idea that @entity63 is the one national identity that nobody ’s allowed to celebrate			0
’ the @entity49 poll , which took the thoughts of more than 2,300 people , also revealed the most popular choices for the best ‘ spokesman for @entity101 ’			1
@entity102 of the list - which excluded politicians - was the @entity105 , who was in the top three choice for 57 per cent of respondents			2
@entity108 was the actor and comedian @entity110 with 27 per cent , while the archbishop of @entity112 , @entity113 , was picked by 12 per cent .			0

a recent survey found *attitude* is considered ' outdated '
@entity118 found queuing , apologising and talking about the weather are the most @entity3 traits
more than half chose the @entity105 as the best ' spokesman for @entity101 '
