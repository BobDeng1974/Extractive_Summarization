he said : ‘ what we are trying to do is to help with the situation that we face			0
‘ @entity147 , that is the humanitarian situation that we face ... but alongside the humanitarian crisis there is also a political and extremism crisis in @entity8 that has a direct effect on us back here in the @entity1			2
' he added : ‘ so we are helping the @entity10 , we are working with the @entity8 government to make sure it is more representative of the whole country and , of course , we are working with neighbours and allies to put the maximum amount of pressure on @entity164 and make sure it is properly dealt with			1
‘ we have said that if the @entity10 , the @entity98 , want to have arms from us , that is something we would consider favourably			2
‘ up to now they have not been making that request			0
really the sort of weapons they have been using have been more eastern bloc variety , and so they have been supplied by others			0
’ mr @entity0 said he viewed the @entity10 as the ‘ first line of defence against these murderous extremists in @entity164 that are causing so much damage in @entity8 ’			1
but he insisted that @entity164 had already started inflicting ‘ damage here in @entity179 ’ , highlighting a shooting at a @entity182 museum in @entity183			2
‘ we have already had the first is motivated attacks in @entity179 ; for instance , the dreadful terrorism that took place in @entity183 just a few weeks ago			0
’ however , he stressed : ‘ i want to be absolutely clear to you and to families watching at home , @entity1 is not going to get involved in another war in @entity8			2
‘ we are not going to be putting boots on the ground			2
we are not going to be sending in the @entity7			0

’ until now , @entity1 has limited its role to aid drops , surveillance and transporting supplies to @entity96 forces			2
but mr @entity0 , writing in a sunday newspaper , said : ‘ true security will only be achieved if we use all our resources – aid , diplomacy , our military prowess – to help bring about a more stable world			1
’ he added : ‘ we need a firm security response , whether that is military action to go after the terrorists , international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or uncompromising action against terrorists at home			2
’ while saying he did not back full - scale military involvement and ‘ sending armies to fight or occupy ’ , mr @entity0 left open the possibility of @entity1 taking on a more direct role in supporting @entity8 and @entity96 troops on the ground			1
speaking on a visit to the @entity86 base in @entity73 , mr @entity15 said : ‘ this is not simply a humanitarian mission			0
