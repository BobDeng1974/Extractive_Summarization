by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 no sooner had one regime slunk out of the back gates at @entity6 ’s @entity5 training ground than another was driving in through the front			1
before 9am on wednesday , @entity9 was back at his spiritual football home			2
the story of @entity9 and @entity6 this season serves , in many ways , as a window into the uncertain , unhappy world of @entity16			1
@entity16 , sacked by @entity6 on tuesday morning , thought he had offered @entity9 a role last autumn and briefly the former @entity19 midfielder worked with @entity20 and the @entity21			1
class of ' 92 : ( @entity22 ) @entity23 , @entity20 , @entity24 and @entity9 are on @entity6 's coaching staff old times : all coaches along with @entity28 and @entity29 were in the 1992 fa youth cup final team reunion : four of the six from @entity33 will be in the @entity6 dugout soon , though , the relationship was in pieces , with @entity9 heading back home to @entity38 under the impression @entity16 did n’t want him			1
on wednesday morning , @entity6 ’s interim manager @entity23 had repaired the damage with a single phone call and his former team - mate was back amongst it at first - team training			1
@entity6 ’s technical area will begin to resemble a screen grab from the class of ’ 92 movie when @entity49 arrive in the @entity50 on saturday			2
@entity23 , for his part , knows that his role as @entity6 manager will be a cameo			1
he will not be considered for the post at this stage and is aware the incoming manager — set to be foreign — may not want him either			0
between now and the end of the season , though , he will attempt to turn back time and it is hard to blame him			0
before telling the @entity6 squad on tuesday afternoon that he was bringing in @entity9 and indeed @entity20 , @entity23 sat the players down and delivered a simple message			1
‘ @entity23 was very straightforward , as always , ’ revealed an informed source			2
‘ he told the players it was time to go back to playing like @entity6			1
wide smile : @entity23 arriving at @entity5 as he plans for @entity6 's @entity50 game against @entity49 interim manager : @entity23 will take temporary charge at @entity6 after the dismissal of @entity16 @entity74 ninja : @entity9 has returned to the club after getting the impression that he was not wanted by @entity77 support act : @entity23 and @entity24 join @entity16 in the dugout during a game against @entity81 at @entity82 @entity16 was mocked by @entity6 ’s players for reading a self - help book called @entity85 , and it is no wonder when you look at some of the bizarre advice it offers : keep it simple — be a hedgehog , not a fox			1
achieve @entity93 — big hairy audacious goals			0
create alignment by results , not hoopla			0
1 ) get the right people on the bus			0
2 ) get the right people in the right seats			0
3 ) get the wrong people off the bus			0
‘ he said it was time to get on the front foot , to press and to start dictating games			0
like everyone else in the room , he is fed up worrying about the opposition all the time			0
‘ he wants this team to be ruthless , brave and unforgiving , just as it used to be			0
’ @entity23 — for all his understandable denials — is known to have disagreed with @entity16 ’s tactics			2
on more than one occasion , he tried to persuade sir @entity117 ’s successor to change his outlook			0
the style the 40 - year - old will attempt to impose on saturday at @entity19 will owe much more to @entity117 — and indeed his first youth coach @entity125 — than it will the man who drove out through @entity5 ’s rear entrance after his dismissal			0
not so great @entity126 : @entity16 failed to live up expectations , losing 11 league games during his tenure back to the future : @entity23 has told players they will return to playing ' the @entity6 ' way in the frame : @entity23 realises that @entity134 and @entity135 are favourites to take the job permanently @entity23 has told central midfielders including @entity139 that they are not to sit alongside holding player @entity140 any more but to move into advanced positions and hurt the opposition when @entity6 have the ball			1
@entity139 , who has struggled more than most this season , is expected to start against @entity49 , as is another academy product , @entity146 , and @entity147			1
not surprisingly , @entity23 will jettison @entity148 and , more controversially , is giving thought to leaving out @entity150			1
if @entity6 start without almost £ 60m of @entity16 signings then it will represent a staggering indictment of the mistakes of the past eight months			2
@entity148 has been so poor that moyes himself had started to drop him while @entity150 ’s form has been lamentable since @entity6 signed him in january			1
respected figures in the game have been critical of @entity150 ’s inability to influence games going against @entity6 since he moved from @entity161 and there is no way @entity23 will select players he believes do n’t have the courage to receive possession in difficult areas			1
mentor : @entity23 will try and implement a style of play learned under his former manager sir @entity117 mutiny ? reports of unrest among seniors players in the @entity6 dressing room persist on saturday , @entity19 will witness a highly motivated @entity6 team			1
it could well be that @entity49 suffer			0
@entity6 , with nothing of worth left to play for , will attack the game unshackled , motivated by a desire to show they are better off without @entity16			2
there remains a key group of senior players who believe @entity16 has tried to turn public opinion against them			0
that is a dubious assertion			0
nevertheless , motivated footballers can do remarkable things and it would be no surprise if @entity6 finish their miserable season with a flourish that will remind people of their true worth			2
the @entity6 board — with the @entity197 in attendance — will look on with interest			2
as they continue their efforts to turn the heads of @entity134 and @entity135 towards @entity204 these coming days , they are aware that a few @entity23 victories will start a bandwagon of public opinion in favour of the @entity210 ’s appointment			2
whatever happens , he will not get the job this time			0
it could , however , be fun watching him try and that particular commodity has been rather thin on the ground in @entity215 this season			0
on the attack : @entity139 will be encouraged to take up more forward positions in @entity6 's midfield collateral damage : new signings @entity150 and @entity148 could lose their places under @entity23 make a mark : united fans would love to see @entity23 get the job is he impresses in the final four games			1

@entity23 called @entity9 and persuaded him to help coach the side
they will be joined by @entity24 and @entity20 in the @entity6 dugout
@entity23 wants the team to start playing the ' @entity6 ' way again
@entity139 is likely to get a game with @entity148 and @entity150 possibly dropped while @entity23 is in charge
