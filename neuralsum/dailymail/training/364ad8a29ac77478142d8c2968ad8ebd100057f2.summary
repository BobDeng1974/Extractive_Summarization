socks are a @entity2 stocking staple but while the majority of us are happy with plain old wool , for those who can afford it , @entity0 have launched a £ 726 vicuña pair			1
the socks , which come with their own presentation box , are only available in golden - brown as the vicuña , an illama - like camelid that hails from @entity15 , produces wool so delicate that the dyeing process would damage it beyond repair			2
but those who want a pair will need to place their orders quickly , as just 10 pairs of the luxury socks have been made			1
luxurious : the limited edition socks are made from vicuña wool which is quite literally worth its weight in gold the socks are part of @entity32 hosiery specialist @entity0 's autumn / winter collection , which also includes 20 limited edition pullovers , each worth approximately £ 2,015 , created from the same fabric			1
the range , which offers a choice of roll or v - necklines , offers a luxury spin on the brand 's mainline menswear collection , most of which crafted from merino wool , silk and cashmere			2
' the fine wool and thermal properties communicate the uniqueness of the yarn , ' explain the company in a description on the website			0
' @entity0 is the first clothing manufacturer producing socks made of this premium wool			1
@entity56 wool is the rarest and most expensive wool in the world , being softer , lighter and warmer than any other wool			1
' since the fibres are very delicate , the wool ’s natural golden colour remains unchanged			0
' expensive : the £ 726 socks come in a special presentation box and only 10 pairs of the footwear have been made endangered : @entity56 , which live in the @entity67 and can only be shorn once every two years , are protected by law the vicuña is a small endangered camelid that lives in the @entity15 andes and produces some of the most expensive wool in the world			1
related to the illama and the alpaca , the fineness of vicuña makes it stand out from that of its less expensive cousins			0
additional value is created by its rarity - and its mountainous habitat			0
just to make getting your hands on vicuña wool even more difficult , each animal can be shorn just once every two years under @entity15 law			0
dubbed the world 's most expensive fabric , vicuña wool is quite literally worth its weight in gold because of its rarity and the difficulty involved in obtaining it			1
@entity56 , a relative of the illama and the ancestor of the alpaca , are the national animals of @entity15 and live high in the @entity67 mountains			2
their wool is the finest of all animal - derived fibres , is just 12 micro-metres in diameter and can not be dyed because it is so delicate			0
an endangered species , vicuñas can not be domesticated , so all wool is taken from wild animals , which can only be caught and sheared once every two years			0
if that was n't enough , each animal produced just one pound of wool each , making the wool rare as well as hard to get hold of			0
but for those who can afford to splash out £ 726 on a pair of socks , rarity is likely to be just as much of a reason to buy as keeping their feet warm .			2

@entity56 is the world 's most expensive fabric and is worth its weight in gold
the socks are being launched in a limited edition run of 10 by @entity0
the company also offers a run of 20 pullovers , each of which costs £ 2,015
