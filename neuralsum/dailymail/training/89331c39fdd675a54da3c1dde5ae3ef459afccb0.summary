a couple who raised two deadly cheetahs in their home , are now teaching the pair to hunt so that they can be released back into the wild - by playing football with them			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who took the cubs into their @entity11 home a year ago , are using a plastic ball to train the cheetahs and bizarrely their mad method appears to be working			1
the pair , both 29 , first started caring for the wild cats when a cheetah at the @entity19 gave birth to four cubs			2
twelve months on , the extraordinary couple are now using some unusual methods to teach the deadly cheetahs to hunt for themselves before they are reintroduced into the wild in about 18 months			2
the husband and wife team started with the basics by encouraging the cheetahs to chase a football , first around their garden and then down a hill at the reserve			2
joint effort : the husband and wife team started with the basics by encouraging the cheetahs to chase a football , first around their garden and then down a hill at the reserve game plan : @entity8 said ' we started off by developing the skills of chasing , catching and holding , those three movements are probably the most important ' @entity7 and @entity8 then progressed onto simulating ambushes , with @entity7 moving towards a group of springbok , while @entity8 hides with the two cats , waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack			1
@entity8 believes that playing football with the cheetahs helps them learn the fundamental techniques needed to become a successful hunter			1
@entity8 said : ' we started off by developing the skills of chasing , catching and holding , those three movements are probably the most important			1
' regardless of their speed , without having the ability to catch and hold their prey , their hunt would be for nothing			2
preparation : as part of the training @entity7 moves towards a group of springbok , while @entity8 hides with the two cats , waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack time to begin : @entity7 checks the harness on of the cubs before they start a day 's work training : ' regardless of their speed , without having the ability to catch and hold their prey , their hunt would be for nothing , ' says @entity8 taking a break : having almost mastered the basics , the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations on the prowl : @entity8 believes that playing football with the cheetahs helps them learn the fundamental techniques needed to become a successful hunter ' by hunting quickly , and more importantly , efficiently , cheetahs make hunting seem like an easy task			1
' having almost mastered the basics , the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations			0
@entity7 said : ' they see something and they think that if they start to run they 'll catch it , which is not the case at all			1
they 'll never catch it			0
' so they need to know that they 've got as close as possible before they start running			0
' it takes a while for them to learn what their limitations are and exactly what they 're looking at			0
' wild cheetahs do n't take chances because they know that their strength lies in their speed rather than their physical strength			0
' their mother , when she was younger , was hunting things twice her size			0
she is as good as it gets so they 've inherited some good traits			0
' at two and a half years old the cheetahs will be fully grown ( twice their current size ) and it is hoped they will have developed enough successful hunting skills to be released			0
despite their ability to accelerate up to speeds of 120 kilometres per hour in short spurts , cheetahs are ambush predators , they trick their prey rather than chase them in a straight line			0
watchful eye : @entity8 watches as the cheetahs attack during their training time to learn : the pair are walked along the grass before their training begins attack : the cheetahs pounce on their prey speed : a cheetah running for the ball as the training gets underway in the hot sun future : at two and a half years old the cheetahs will be fully grown ( twice their current size ) and it is hoped they will have developed enough successful hunting skills to be released speeds : despite their ability to accelerate up to speeds of 120 kilometres per hour in short spurts , cheetahs are ambush predators , they trick their prey rather than chase them in a straight line time out : the cheetahs relax after a hard day 's training			1

@entity7 and @entity8 took the cubs into @entity11 home a year ago
their bizarre training method appears to be working
