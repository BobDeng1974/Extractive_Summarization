as @entity1 goes before another tribunal , this time at the @entity3 , we have to wonder what kind of advice he is receiving			1
or if he is listening			0
even when he gets the verdict , the young man who believes he was robbed by @entity8 still does n't win			1
which tends to be what happens when you file a case in which even a victorious outcome can not deliver the judgement you really want			0
@entity15 went all the way to @entity17 to ask the @entity18 to enforce a return fight in the wake of that controversial stoppage by @entity8 in their world super-middleweight title clash			1
up for the battle : @entity1 is petitioning the @entity3 to declare his fight with @entity8 a no contest after they bent to his demand , @entity1 was reminded that as the mandatory challenger he would be entitled to only 15 per cent of the purse			1
this after he had turned down a seven figure offer from the @entity8 camp			1
sorry , said the @entity18 when he went back to them pleading for something more equitable , they had done all they could			0
now @entity1 is petitioning the @entity34 to declare his fight with @entity8 a no contest			1
since the @entity3 rarely , if ever , come to such a decision – and stood four - square behind their senior referee @entity40 at the time - it is unlikely that the solitary blemish on @entity1 ' record will be expunged at this wednesday 's meeting			1
but even if the @entity3 were to take such action it would not improve his monetary bargaining position			0
@entity8 would remain the @entity18 world champion , as well as holder of the @entity50 ' regular ' title , and still be entitled to 85 per cent of the booty			1
@entity1 might have been better served concentrating on his campaign to encourage the court of public opinion to embarrass @entity8 into giving him a second shot			1
his share of a voluntary match would have been greater			0
now it could be economically shrewder for him , not @entity8 , to be the one who pulls out – for the moment			1
that would release @entity8 to defend his titles against @entity62 – namesake son of the @entity65 legend - who enjoys huge @entity67 support in @entity68			1
@entity69 is preparing for a re-match of his own – against @entity71 - on march 1			0
if a @entity69 victory would be likely to put the seal on a @entity8 deal , the @entity72 might well be at ringside in @entity78 's @entity77 that night			2
if @entity8 were to lose in @entity80 in mid-summer , the domestic rematch would still be massive box office at an @entity83 football ground later this year or early in 2015 – with @entity1 able to negotiate a purse much closer to parity			1
in the meantime , he can find other ways of cashing in on a reputation much enhanced by his performance against @entity8			2
better that , maybe , than shooting himself in the wallet			0
calling the shots : referee @entity40 controversially stopped the title bout in the ninth round picture that : @entity95 mocked @entity96 @entity95 kept one critical eye on @entity96 even as he finished sparring prior to his fight this saturday night at the @entity99 in @entity101 's @entity100			1
@entity95 sustained damage to his left eyebrow while flexing his fists against @entity68 stable - mate @entity106 – and could not resist a jibe at @entity96 for cancelling their @entity108 by publishing a photograph of a gash of his own on the same spot			1
@entity95 posted a picture of his wound on @entity117 and wrote : ' look			2
should i do a @entity119 and pull out			0
p * * * y. i 'm still fighting			0
' that was @entity96 's second withdrawal from facing @entity95 – having cited a ruptured shoulder first time – but the 6ft 9in @entity125 traveller seriously doubts he was injured on either occasion			2
with @entity96 now in semi-retirement , @entity95 and @entity127 are vying to be become our next @entity130 home - boy to challenge multi-world heavyweight champion @entity132			2
@entity127 tops saturday 's bill , with @entity95 as the main support			2
if both big men win they are scheduled to meet at @entity138 's football ground in what could be a final eliminator for @entity132 's @entity142 title			0
@entity95 takes on @entity68 slugger @entity143 – who either knocks out his opponents or gets flattened himself			1
next challenge : @entity127 will face @entity68 @entity147 on saturday @entity127 , who took @entity132 's brother @entity148 the full 12 rounds in his one world title fight thus far , appears to have a slightly more complicated task against another @entity68			1
@entity147 is an experienced world title - challenging veteran who once lasted the distance against @entity132			0
but both should win to set up their midsummer showdown			0
@entity156 , @entity157 will be live on @entity158 on saturday night via @entity159 437 or @entity160 546			0
now that @entity162 has had his fun with that @entity117 poll , an amusing charade in which he invited the fans to choose his next opponent , we can expect the long - awaited confirmation that the world 's no 1 boxer will fight @entity173 's @entity172 in @entity80 on may 3			0
for what it was worth , @entity162 's spot of mischief ended with @entity172 way ahead of @entity178 , the @entity179 hit - man who recently upset @entity180 but who has been beaten by @entity184 's former @entity183 silver medallist			0
@entity172 captured almost 60 per cent of the 35,000 votes cast			0
the poll served as useful propaganda to help sell the fight on pay - per - view in @entity68 , although @entity190 has been in the pipeline since october			1
diplomat : @entity172 ( right ) captured 60 per cent of the vote as to who should fight @entity195 next it is being rumoured that @entity197 is about to announce a comeback in his @entity200 homeland – at 63 and 15 years after his last fight			1
@entity197 took @entity202 the distance twice but upset his @entity173 fans when given a narrow decision over the much - loved @entity206			2
he hung up the gloves in 1999 after defeating @entity208			0
this smacks of a publicity stunt , or an early @entity212 's joke			0
if not , at two years shy of pensionable age , say it ai n't so , @entity197			2
in black and white : @entity197 fought the legendary @entity202 over 40 years ago			2

@entity1 is petitioning the @entity34 to declare his fight with @entity8 a no contest
@entity95 prepares to take on @entity68 slugger @entity143
it is being rumoured that @entity197 is about to announce a comeback *...* aged 63 !
