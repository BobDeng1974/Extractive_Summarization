@entity0 was shoved in the street by a member of the public this morning in a ' very significant security breach ' - sparking an immediate inquiry by @entity6			1
the prime minister was in @entity8 to promote the government 's proposed high speed railway line			2
but as he came out of the city 's @entity12 a passing jogger ran up to him at speed forcing mr @entity0 to move out of the way while his surrounding security team look on			1
within hours the metropolitan police commissioner @entity17 had ordered an investigation into how the man was allowed to get so close to the pm			1
it comes less than a week after a lone - wolf gunman killed a soldier before attacking the @entity24 @entity23 in @entity25			1
this afternoon jogger @entity26 revealed he was the man who managed to run into mr @entity0 without being stopped by his security squad			1
the 28 - year - old complained this afternoon he merely ' brushed ' the prime minister only to be ' assaulted by half a dozen coppers in suits '			1
a spokesman said : ' the @entity50 is aware of an incident in @entity8 today , monday , 27 october , involving a 28 - year - old man and the prime minister as he left the @entity12			1
' the man was arrested by local officers and was later de-arrested			2
the @entity56 is responsible for the personal protection of the prime minister and will now conduct a review of the incident in consultation with @entity46			1
' mr @entity0 spotted the man running up to him and took a step back and to the left before security noticed and bundled the protester to the floor			1
the pm did not fall over and calmly walked to his waiting car before being driven away from the scene uninjured			1
one witness said mr @entity0 ' sidestepped ' the man in a ' lovely little move '			1
the jogger had crossed the pavement towards the prime minister , clutching a white towel			0
police took the 28 - year - old man away			1
he was arrested but later released			2
@entity46 said that no threat had been made , adding : ' nothing sinister , just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
' but conservative mp @entity83 demanded a full investigation into how the @entity50 security team allowed the man to get so close to the prime minister			2
@entity88 wrestled the man to the ground before hauling him off into a police van the 28 - year - old was arrested but released saying it was ' nothing sinister , just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time ' he was arrested after prime minister @entity0 left @entity12 after a conference on the planned @entity96 rail links the man was arrested outside @entity12 but was later ' de-arrested ' by officers who said he had not threatened the pm mr @entity83 said : ' @entity99 have some of the best close protection officers in the world			1
however , this was a clear breach of security and could have been far more sinister in outcome			2
' with the terror threat level increased , this can not be allowed to happen again			2
the @entity50 commissioner should call an immediate and swift internal inquiry to discover why this happened and implement the necessary lessons learned as quickly as possible			0
' former royal protection officer @entity111 said mr @entity0 's security had taken their ' eye off the ball '			1
he said : ' they were concentrating on the prime minister rather than looking outwardly at the attackers			0
' it 's a serious security breach			1
the prime minister has then been allowed to stand alone and look at it for a momentary time			0
' what should have happened is something called cover and protect			0
a protection officer puts his hand on the head of the prime minister and straight into the waiting car			1
' it 's a very significant security breach			1
for an attacker to be able to get to a prime minister			0
i do n't remember that happening before			0
' but mr @entity0 later played down the incident , telling mps : ' could i put on the record for once the debt i owe to the close protection teams that look after me and the very good job that they do			1
' making light of the incident , he added : ' @entity143 was in the room as i gave the speech so as i left the room , i thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed			0
but clearly that was n't the case			0
' in 2001 @entity151 former deputy prime minister @entity143 punched a protester who egged him			0
the prime minister 's official spokesman said mr @entity0 expressed his ' gratitude and confidence ' in the protection team			1
@entity159 will co-operate with the @entity50 's review of the incident , the spokesman added			2
witness @entity162 described the man as ' just a typical hippy type ' , adding : ' it looked like @entity0 sidestepped him			2
it was a lovely little move ' mr @entity0 was escorted into a waiting car after the incident in @entity8 following the incident today , chief inspector @entity169 said : ' around midday , a 28 - year - old local man was briefly arrested after he came close to the prime minister 's group who had just left the civic hall in @entity8			1
' no threats were made , and after the man 's details were checked , he was de-arrested and allowed on his way			0
' witness @entity162 described the man as ' just a typical hippy type '			0
he said : ' it looked like @entity0 sidestepped him			2
it was a lovely little move			0
he should be on the stage , really			0
' and then he was tackled by the person behind			0
and then he ( @entity0 ) was in the car and the car was gone			2
' they were on him			0
they were like flies round poo			0
one minute he was down , then he was up again and moving			0
' mr @entity162 said the man ran about 10 yards across the road towards the prime minister			2
