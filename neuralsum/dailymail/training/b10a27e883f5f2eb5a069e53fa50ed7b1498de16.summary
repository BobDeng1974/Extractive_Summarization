it is also reducing access to medicines and care which is further affecting people ’s health , the study suggests			1
the authors , @entity22 political economist dr @entity21 and dr @entity23 , an assistant professor of medicine and an epidemiologist at @entity26 , said their findings show austerity is seriously bad for health			2
in a book to be published this week , the researchers say that more than 10,000 suicides and up to a million cases of depression have been diagnosed during what they call the ‘ @entity36 ’ and its accompanying austerity across @entity9 and @entity10			1
they also claim that in @entity41 , moves like cutting @entity40 prevention budgets have coincided with rates of the @entity44 - causing virus rising by more than 200 per cent since 2011			1
they suggest that the 50 per cent youth employment rate has also increased drug abuse which has further increased the spread of @entity40			0
the study also revealed that @entity41 experienced its first malaria outbreak in decades following budget cuts to mosquito - spraying programmes			1
the researchers added that more than five million @entity54 have lost access to health care during the latest recession , while in @entity59 , some 10,000 families have been pushed into homelessness by the government 's austerity budget			1
‘ our politicians need to take into account the serious - and in some cases profound - health consequences of economic choices , ’ dr @entity21 told @entity64			2

but dr @entity21 and dr @entity23 said negative public health effects are not inevitable , even during the worst economic disasters			0
using data from the @entity97 of the 1930s , to post-communist @entity99 , and from some examples of the current economic downturn , they say financial crises can be prevented from becoming epidemics - if governments respond effectively			0
as an example , they say @entity108 's active labour market programmes helped the numbers of suicides to fall there during its recession while neighbouring countries with no such programmes saw large increases in suicides			2
‘ ultimately what we show is that worsening health is not an inevitable consequence of economic recessions			0
it 's a political choice , ’ dr @entity23 said			0
this is not the first study to suggest that austerity can affect people ’s health			0
researchers at the @entity129 in @entity130 found that it actually improved the health of many people in @entity134 during the early 1990s			0
