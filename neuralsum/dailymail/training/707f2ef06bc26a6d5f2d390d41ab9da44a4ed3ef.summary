covertly tapping the top of someone 's newly opened beer bottle and then standing back as the suds foam out onto the floor is a classic old party trick			2
now @entity7 and @entity8 researchers are toasting their discovery of the science behind the phenomenon			1
lead researcher @entity12 , of @entity13 in @entity7 , said cavitation - a phenomenon relevant to such common engineering concerns as erosion of ship propellers - is the mechanism by which bubbles appear in a liquid such as beer after an impact			1
the team 's investigation of beer bottle - fluid interactions demonstrated that the cavitation - induced break - up of larger ‘ mother ’ bubbles creates clouds of very small carbonic gas ‘ daughter bubbles ’ which grow and expand much faster than the larger mother - bubbles from which they split			1
the rapid expansion of these daughter bubbles gives the foam buoyancy			1
dr @entity12 said : ‘ buoyancy leads to the formation of plumes full of bubbles , whose shape resembles very much the mushrooms seen after powerful explosions			1
here 's why : ‘ and here is what really makes the formation of foam so explosive : the larger the bubbles get , the faster they rise , and the other way around			2
’ he said this is because fast - moving bubbles entrain more carbonic gas			0
the team 's work is believed to be the first quantitative analysis of the beer bottle foam - over			0
dr @entity12 added : ‘ we wanted to explain the extremely high efficiency of the degasification process that occurs in a beer bottle within the first few seconds after the impact			0
’ he said the findings of the study , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) @entity92 , can also be applied to other engineering systems			0
and help experts understand serious natural phenomena such as the sudden release of dissolved carbon dioxide in the 1986 @entity99 disaster			0
this saw a catastrophic sudden release of the gas from the @entity104 lake and the suffocation of 1,700 people who lived nearby .			0

an impact on the glass creates ' mother ' bubbles , then ' daughter ' bubbles that cause foam to rush upwards , say @entity8 and @entity7 researchers
the shape of the foam resembles a *nuclear* bomb mushroom cloud
