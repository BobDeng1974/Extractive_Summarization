bed - blocking is bringing the @entity2 ‘ to its knees ’ with doctors unable to discharge more than 1,000 patients each day , a study reveals today			1
the crisis has deepened due to a lack of available council - provided care for the elderly			0
on one day this september , staff were unable to move 4,966 patients to another part of the @entity2 or into council care – the most since 2010			1
that month , a total 138,068 ‘ days of care ’ were lost due to these delayed transfers , analysis by @entity17 found			1
with bed places costing £ 250 a day , this suggests that @entity2 hospitals are wasting £ 34million a month on patients that should not still be there			2
backlog : a lack of social care is keeping the elderly in hospital and research suggests that @entity2 hospitals are wasting £ 34million every month on patients that should not still be there ( file picture , posed by model ) the number of ‘ acute ’ admissions unable to be transferred from beds that could have been used for accident and emergency wards was also found to have hit the highest level on record – meaning ambulances have nowhere to put incoming patients			1
more than a quarter of the delays were attributed to a lack of social care			1
funding for this has dropped significantly since the @entity47 came to power , as councils look to cut costs			0
the main reason cited for social care - related delays was ‘ patients awaiting a care package in their own home ’			1
@entity2 chief sir @entity57 told @entity17 that bed - blocking is a ‘ major issue ’			1
he added : ‘ i was concerned about it as a practising surgeon , i ’m concerned about it as a medical director			0
' if you ca n’t get patients out of hospital and back into their own homes – where they ’re safe and want to be – then the whole system backs up , you ca n’t treat people effectively in @entity71 , ambulances start to form queues at the front door			0
’ a recent survey by @entity75 found 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied by someone who could have been moved on			0

’ @entity89 , chief executive of the @entity90 which represents hospital bosses , said : ‘ we are going back downhill to 15 years ago , when the @entity2 was an international joke because you had to wait most of the day in an @entity71 department			2
nobody wants to go back to that but you get what you pay for			0
’ social care is provided at home and in the community by local authorities but , under pressure from the government to cut costs , they have slashed budgets by around a fifth , or almost £ 3.5billion in total			2
@entity110 , @entity111 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ it is truly sad that record numbers of older people are trapped in hospital when they are well enough to be at home			0
rather than rising to the challenge of the ageing society , we are going backwards and care is getting worse			0
’ a @entity120 spokesman said that even though the numbers of bed - blockers has gone up , the rate of delayed discharges as a proportion of hospital admissions has gone down			2
‘ the figures actually show that hospitals are discharging patients more quickly on average than at any time since the @entity2 started collecting this data , ’ he said .			2
