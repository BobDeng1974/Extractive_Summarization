by @entity0 @entity3 's groundbreaking promotional @entity2 video featuring the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 did n't do their top ambassadors much good at the tournament proper			1
the animated short sees football superstars including @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 join forces against ' the clones ' as part of the sportswear company 's ' riskeverything ' campaign			2
however , while football 's greatest players overcame their adversaries in the five - minute animated film entitled ' @entity25 ' , all except @entity28 goalkeeper @entity27 did n't fare so well when faced with the reality of the tournament			2
@entity12 the former @entity36 defender scored a wordly of a free - kick to setlle the quarter - final game against @entity43 but his typically cavalier defending was partly blamed for @entity38 's 7 - 1 humiliation at the hands of the @entity40			1
tearful exit : @entity12 's gung - ho defending was cruelly exposed in @entity38 's 7 - 1 humiliation by @entity47 2			1
@entity14 the @entity49 playmaker was part of the @entity52 team that sounded the death knell for tiki - taka when the reigning champions crashed out after only two games following a 5 - 1 hammering by @entity58 and lacklustre defeat to @entity60			0
the pain in @entity52 : @entity14 ( @entity62 ) saw the reigning champion 's run come to an abrupt end in @entity38 3			1
@entity7 perhaps the saddest moment at the @entity2 came after @entity38 's poster had inspired an average side towards the semi-finals only for a late , robust challenge by @entity43 's @entity71 to rule him out for the rest of the tournament with a broken vertebrae			1
back to square one : @entity7 was ruled out of the tournament after breaking a vertebrae ... the rest is history 4			0
@entity5 the preening @entity79 was beset by niggling injuries ahead of the tournament and failed to inspire his side past @entity47 and the @entity28 in the group stages , before scoring his only goal against @entity85			2
to make matters worse , his arch nemesis @entity86 has reached the final			0
the shame ! @entity5 could n't inspire @entity90 ... while arch rival @entity86 reached the final 5			2
@entity27 there is always an exception to the rule and the @entity28 keeper 's heroics , especially in a thrilling extra-time defeat to @entity98 raised his stock to the extent that he received a personal call from president @entity104 amid cries to have a @entity107 airport named after him			0
super saver : @entity27 was the exception with his goalkeeping heroics before being edged out by @entity98 6			0
@entity13 the curse of @entity3 fell on the @entity114 playmaker before the tournament had even started when the @entity117 star was forced to miss the greatest show on earth after injuring his lower back in training			2
@entity114 rallied without him before failing to turn up against the @entity40			0
early shower : @entity13 was ruled out for @entity114 after suffering a back injury in training 7			0
@entity6 @entity127 's so - called talisman may have scored his first and only goal at the @entity2 but it was another tournament that failed to live up to expectations while there were even calls for the @entity134 striker to be dropped			1
and , that was before he lost his luggage			0
another one bites the dust : @entity6 scored his first and only @entity2 goal , but that was about it 8			0
@entity15 the @entity141 frontman was forced to claim that the tournament would n't be the same without him after @entity143 were beaten by a @entity5 - inspired @entity90 in a qualifying play - off game that saw him spend his summer on holiday instead of @entity38			1
summer break : @entity15 was n't even on the plane after @entity143 lost to @entity90 in play - offs			1

@entity3 's promotional @entity2 video seemed to put a curse on star players
@entity12 's cavalier defending was partly blamed for @entity40 humiliation
@entity14 saw @entity52 's world *domi*nation** come to an abrupt end
@entity7 's broken vertebrae *effectively* ended host *nation* @entity38 's hopes
@entity5 could n't inspire @entity90 out of the group stages
@entity27 was the exception after his goalkeeping heroics for the @entity28
@entity13 was injured in a @entity114 training *session* before tournament
there were calls for @entity6 to be dropped from @entity127 's @entity174
@entity15 did n't even make it after @entity143 's play - off defeat
