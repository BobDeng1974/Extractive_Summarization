@entity0 will not be renaming @entity1			1
earlier this week it emerged @entity4 giants @entity5 were set to sell naming rights to their iconic @entity8 home to energy firm @entity9			1
reports in @entity11 , which the club declined to comment on , suggested the stadium would become the @entity14 , named after the homeland of the company ’s owners as part of a wider 500m euros deal			2
@entity0 are not prepared to sell the naming rights to @entity1 , despite their rivals ' plans the club believe there would be little appetite to rename the stadium as people will always call it @entity1 and with @entity0 ’s cross-town rivals raking in a reported £ 400m over 10 years after they sold the @entity30 naming rights along with a host of other sponsorship rights to @entity34 , some believed it was only a matter of time until the club ’s 115 - year - old home was next on the list			1
@entity40 , however , understands @entity0 officials have no plans to follow suit			0
they believe there would be little commercial appetite for such a proposal given that few would refer to the stadium as anything other than @entity1			2
added to an undoubtedly furious backlash from supporters , the feeling is that such a move would make little sense			0
@entity5 's @entity8 stadium is set to be renamed @entity14 the @entity14 was opened in 1947 and is one of the most iconic venues in world football the stadium was named after former @entity5 chairman @entity60 a source said : ‘ it ’s been made clear before - @entity1 is @entity1 and there are no plans to change that			1
what does or does not happen in @entity5 makes absolutely no difference to us			0
’ down the road from @entity0 ’s home , @entity69 play at @entity72 while a host of clubs across the world are cashing in from lucrative deals			0
at @entity78 , the agreement with @entity34 was key as they attempted to meet @entity81 ’s @entity80 criteria			2
however , they only moved to the stadium in 2003 and there was little affinity among supporters with its existing name .			0
