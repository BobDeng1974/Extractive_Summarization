by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 09:14 est , 10 march 2014 a pet puppy miraculously survived a 200ft fall with only minor injuries after bolting over a grassy ridge on the edge of a cliff			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were walking their two four - month - old puppies @entity10 and @entity13 at the 350ft - high @entity15 cliffs near @entity16 , @entity17 , when they both ran off			1
the couple called for their dogs using a special whistle - but only border collie @entity13 returned			1
they then peered over the edge and saw little cocker spaniel @entity10 on a grassy ledge about 200ft down			1
scene : the two puppies bolted over a grassy ridge of the @entity15 cliffs near @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity10 's 200ft fall is pictured on the image with a white line safety : coastguard @entity38 , after having rescued @entity10 ( left ) , and @entity10 with owner @entity36 ( right ) coming to help : @entity38 , a coastguard for @entity42 , is lowered down to rescue @entity10 after the fall mr and mrs pipe , both 50 , dialled 999 and a cliff rescue specialist abseiled down the cliff to reach the black and grey pooch before hauling it back up to safety in an animal rescue bag at 12pm yesterday			1
mrs @entity52 , a car parts delivery driver from @entity54 , @entity17 , said : ‘ the dogs were running around off the lead and we were using a recall whistle to call them back to us			2
‘ we have done this before and usually have no problem , they are very obedient			0
but during the walk both dogs disappeared over a ridge and as soon as i saw them vanish i blew the whistle			1
‘ @entity13 came straight back but @entity10 was nowhere to be seen			1
my husband and i went over the ridge to see where he was			0
as we walked nearer the edge we saw him about 200ft down on a grassy slope			2
‘ i immediately thought he must have some severe injuries like a broken back or broken back legs			0
it was just awful and i was in shock - i had no idea what to do , and could n’t believe it had happened			0
teamwork : mrs pipe ( centre ) is reunited with her pet @entity10 after @entity83 rescued him @entity84 day : little cocker spaniel @entity10 was found by rescuers on a grassy ledge after falling around 200ft relief : mrs pipe ( pictured with 20 - week - old @entity10 ) is a car parts delivery driver from @entity54 , @entity17 ‘ we alerted the coastguards who did an amazing job and got him to safety using an animal bag			1
' my heart was in my mouth when they reached the top of the cliff and the coastguard officer said he seemed to be okay			0
' i immediately thought he must have some severe injuries like a broken back or broken back legs			0
it was just awful and i was in shock ' @entity36 ' he was a bit dazed and traumatised but i took him to the vets and although he has some bruising to the mouth and a swollen eye , he is absolutely fine			0
’ @entity38 , a coastguard with the @entity42 coastguard team , said : ‘ @entity10 was off the lead and he went over the edge of the cliff			2
the cliffs are made up of a steep grassy slope at the top , then a vertical drop , and then another slope			2
‘ luckily @entity10 had managed to land on a slope and probably rolled to a stop on a gravelly patch			0
if he had landed on flat ground it would have been a different story			0
‘ because he was only 20 weeks old he probably was n’t aware of what was happening and so he did n’t tense up , which is likely to have helped			0
