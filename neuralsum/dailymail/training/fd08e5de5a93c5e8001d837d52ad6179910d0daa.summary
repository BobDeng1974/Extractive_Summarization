by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 is hosting arch - eurocrat @entity3 for dinner at @entity6 tonight , just weeks before crucial @entity8 elections			1
the @entity10 leader will dine with the president of the @entity12 , who is also due to stay the night at the prime minister ’s official rural retreat			1
@entity15 said the timing of mr @entity2 ’s intimate meal with the @entity19 bureaucrat ‘ could not be better ’ as @entity20 prepared to unveil a £ 1.5million poster campaign attacking immigration from the @entity23			2
@entity2 has invited president of the @entity12 , @entity3 , for dinner at @entity6 mr @entity3 is expected to stay the night at @entity6 , although @entity26 would not comment on whether he would be served a continental breakfast mr @entity2 has sought to win back disaffected @entity28 who have been won over by @entity20 with the promise of an in - out referendum			1
the prime minister says he will claw back powers from @entity19 , before staging a vote by the end of 2017			1
he has held a series of meetings with other @entity8 leaders who also want to see reform , particularly over access to benefits by @entity23 migrants and red - tape strangling business			0
@entity20 is poised to top the polls in @entity47 elections on may 22			1
but mr @entity2 ’s decision to give mr @entity3 the honour of dinner at @entity6 will be contrasted with @entity20 's regional push to appeal to voters concerned about immigration			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' this is one of a number of meetings that president @entity3 is having with heads of government around @entity8			1
' it is an opporunity to talk around the future direction of the next @entity65 and @entity23 reform priorities			0
' also i am sure they will discuss the latest on the situation in @entity69			0
it is a working dinner			2
' the spokesman confirmed mr @entity3 would also be staying the night : ' if someone is coming for dinner in the evening , it is polite to ask them to stay the night			1
' however , he refused to be drawn on whether he would be served a continental breakfast tomorrow morning			1
@entity20 leader @entity15 contrasted the dinner at @entity6 with his own trip to @entity79 today to launch his controversial posters mr @entity15 told @entity1 voters on may 22 could deliver a ' severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake ' but mr @entity15 told @entity1 : ' how entirely and utterly appropriate			1
’ ‘ it says absolutely everything about @entity2			0
the timing could not be better			0
‘ this is a @entity8 election that matters			0
you can make a difference			0
if you are with us and the 77 per cent people who think immigration needs to be controlled , vote @entity20			0
‘ you could deliver a severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake on may 22			0
’ however , @entity20 has become embroiled in a fresh racism row after it unveiled the billboards which will appear across the country in the run - up to polling day			2
the party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as : ‘ 26million people in @entity8 are looking for work			0
and whose jobs are they after ? ’ controversial : @entity20 's new posters are being funded by £ 1.5m of funding from millionaire @entity112 donor @entity110 to launch its biggest ever publicity drive ahead of the @entity47 elections in may adverts : under the slogan ' take back control of our country ' , the party complain that 75 per cent of @entity122 laws are made in @entity19 and that @entity122 taxpayers fund the ' celebrity lifestyle ' of @entity23 bureaucrats another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street , with the slogan : ‘ @entity23 policy at work			1
@entity122 workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour			1
’ all the posters call on voters to ‘ @entity136 ’ by backing @entity20 in the @entity8 elections			2
@entity10 mp @entity139 , the grandson of sir @entity140 , wrote on @entity141 : ‘ at a time when our country really needs to come together , the @entity20 advertising campaign is deeply divisive , offensive and ignorant			2
’ @entity147 frontbencher @entity146 said : ‘ @entity20 would have us believe they stand for working people but the truth is very different - they 're even more right wing than the @entity28			2
‘ a vote for @entity20 is a vote for higher taxes for working families , charges to see your gp , huge tax giveaways for the rich and even deeper cuts to public services			0
only @entity147 can make @entity122 better off			0
’ senior @entity165 peer @entity163 said the posters were ‘ extreme even by the standards of the @entity168 ’ , the @entity162 far right party mr @entity15 has tried to distance @entity20 from .			0
