by @entity0 when opening a village fair , @entity2 mp @entity1 thought she ’d name drop a few local attractions to show how in - touch she is with her constituency			1
but the politican was left embarrassed when she confused @entity7 , @entity8 , for another village with the same name some 70 miles away			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 described the village on the edge of her constituency as being famous for its beautiful waterfalls and deep caves during a speech at the @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity19 - faced : @entity2 mp for @entity20 @entity1 confused @entity7 , @entity8 , with its @entity22 namesake some 70 miles away			1
she made the mistake during a speech at a village fayre mistake : the @entity2 mp said @entity7 , @entity8 , was famed for its beautiful waterfalls and caves			1
but she meant the @entity22 village known for such landscapes as the @entity30 , pictured beauty : the yorkshire village is partially located in the @entity33 and is famed for its landscapes but the @entity20 mp had confused the tiny village with a population of just 400 with another on the edge of the @entity33			2
organisers from the @entity41 and @entity18 were angered by saturday 's incident - and furiously said it was unlikely she would ever be invited back			2
today , ms @entity1 - who is accused of basing her speech from the @entity48 entry for the other @entity7 - laughed off the mistake by calling it ' a simple accident '			1
@entity52 , a local resident who works at @entity54 pub in @entity55 said : ' i think it ’s definitely arrogance			0
' i only moved here in february and i have seen a lot of customers get mixed up with the villages			0
' but as an mp for this constituency she should know better , you should know the area that you are serving			0
' village life : @entity7 in @entity8 , pictured , is a small village - with a population of just 400 high street : @entity7 in @entity22 is much larger - and has a bustling centre with shops and pubs , pictured @entity73 , a member of the show ’s organising committee said : ' she obviously does not know the place and whoever had done the research for the speech had not got it right			1
' a lot of what she said is mentioned in the first part of the @entity48 entry for that @entity7			0
' she spoke about our links with sir @entity87 who was a regular visitor and got married at the other @entity55 , but does n't mean much in this one			0
' it did n’t make her look very good			0
i spoke to one or two people who had realised what she ’d done			0
' i think that if it had being pointed out to her it would have made it more embarrassing			0
attractions : @entity99 in @entity8 , pictured , is one of the few attractions in the village - which is a short distance from @entity103 and is on the edge of the mp 's constituency impressive : @entity106 in the @entity22 village - which was visited regularly by sir @entity87 as his mother lived in the region ' i do n’t think that we ’ll be asking @entity1 back to open the fair			1
' @entity2 mp ms @entity1 said : ' i am sorry that i made the mistake			1
it was an honest accident on my behalf and some people pointed it out to me on the day			2
' @entity7 in @entity22 is famous for its caves and people from all over the country flock there to go pot - holing			1
then other @entity7 is a small village just outside of @entity103 in @entity8			2
location : @entity7 , @entity8 - 8 miles to the west of @entity103			2

new village hall built in @entity135 , @entity22 - a heaven for outdoor enthusiasts			2

in partially in the @entity33 and so offers waterfalls , limestone caves and @entity147 landscape walking opportunities			0
@entity87 was a regular visitor to the area and was married locally , as his mother lived in the area			0
some believe the inspiration for the name @entity154 came from the village - as numerous well - known figures in the village during the 1800s had the surname @entity160			0
local life : @entity7 , @entity8 - @entity54 pub , @entity163 , @entity22 - as well as the outdoors activities , three lively pubs including the well - know @entity166 .			1
