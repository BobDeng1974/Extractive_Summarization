while not wanting to draw any direct comparisons between the contenders , @entity5 has no doubts centre - back @entity1 could perform the role if asked			2
' i do n't want you to say that i prefer @entity1 in front of @entity31 or @entity1 is better than @entity31			1
no , i just speak about @entity1 and @entity41 can be a captain , ' said @entity5			2
@entity6 : @entity5 said that the reason he is not captain at @entity6 is that there are more senior players ' he is not the captain here because we made the decision that @entity49 ( @entity50 ) is the captain for many , many years , and after that it is about years at the club , so @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , ( @entity49 ) @entity56 , so he has lots of guys in front of him			0
' so is he going to be @entity6 captain ? i hope not , because for him to be ( @entity6 ) captain then five or six of the other guys they are not able to play			0
