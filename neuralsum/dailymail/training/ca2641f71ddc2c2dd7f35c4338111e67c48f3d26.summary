by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 09:43 est , 20 march 2012 inflation joy : @entity2 , pictured today in @entity3 , was boosted by the news that inflation has fallen to a 15 - month low on the eve of his budget @entity2 was given a pre-budget boost today as inflation fell to a 15 - month low of 3.4 per cent			1
lower utility bills and discounts from struggling retailers have contributed to the fall in the consumer prices index ( @entity15 )			2
inflation dipped to 3.4 per cent last month down from 3.6 per cent in january , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said as energy companies @entity18 and @entity19 cut their prices			1
the last time the @entity15 was lower was in november 2010 when it stood at 3.3 per cent			2
the retail prices index , which includes the cost of mortgages , also fell to 3.7 per cent in february , down from 3.9 per cent in january			1
the figures were published today ahead of @entity2 's budget tomorrow when he is expected to ease the burden on family finances by raising the tax threshold to around £ 9,000			2
he is also expected to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p			2
despite today 's positive inflation news for the chancellor , there are fears that soaring oil prices may prevent it from falling later this year as sharply as had been predicted			1
lower price rises will be welcomed by households that were squeezed by high prices and sluggish wage growth throughout 2011			1
the decision will also add further weight to the @entity44 's decision to pump an extra £ 50billion into its quantitative easing programme last month			2
bank governor sir @entity46 and his colleagues have forecast the rate of inflation to dip below the government 's 2 per cent target at some point early next year			2
the greatest downward pressure on the @entity15 rate came from domestic electricity and gas bills , which fell 1.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively			0
@entity19 reduced gas tariffs by an average 5 per cent for around 1.4 million domestic gas customers last month , after @entity18 announced a 6 per cent fall in electricity bills , benefiting 3.7 million customers			1
falling : the @entity61 , the government 's preferred measure of inflation , fell to 3.4 % last month , figures revealed today			1
it is the first time it has been so low since november 2010 last october , prices were increasing at above 5 % change : the rising cost of alcohol and tobacco added 0.08 % to the cost of a typical basket of goods last month			1
however , inflation was kept down by a large fall in the price of utilities but there was also a drop in the cost of recreation and culture , driven by cheaper digital cameras , pet - related products and books , newspapers and stationery			1
air fares fell by 1.6 per cent , compared to a 2.1 per cent rise a year ago , driven by cheaper @entity91 tickets , the @entity16 said			0
the average price of petrol rose in february by 1.9p a litre to 135.1p , while diesel rose 1.4p to hit a record high of 143p a litre			1
but the @entity16 said this had a negligible effect on the overall rate of inflation			2
the price of crude oil has risen by 25 per cent to $ 125 per barrel since the start of the year as tensions in @entity106 and @entity107 escalate			2
@entity108 and @entity109 discussed releasing more oil reserves onto the market to stop further price rises			1
elsewhere , alcohol prices rose 2.6 per cent which is a record rise for a january - to - february period			1
budget discussions : the quad - ( from left to right ) @entity117 , @entity109 , @entity2 and @entity118 - discuss the @entity119 in 10 @entity3 yesterday boost : @entity2 , pictured during a visit to @entity121 yesterday , was delivered a pre-budget boost as inflation fell to 3.4 per cent @entity124 , chief @entity125 economist at @entity126 , said food prices , which were steady in february , could rise in months ahead in response to the recently - declared droughts			1
she said : ' the downward trend in the headline rate is likely to pause over the next couple of months			0
indeed , inflation could even rise in march on the back of the continued rise in petrol prices			1
' @entity137 , chief economist at the market analysts @entity138 , said : ' the fall was less than expected , but from the @entity44 's perspective , so far so good			2
' but there 's every indication the @entity15 rate will float down , rather than tumble			0
' behind the falling year - on - year number are some conflicting drivers			2
while the prices of many consumer goods have been cut , the oil price crept up throughout february			1
' currently at $ 125 a barrel , oil now poses the primary inflationary risk			2
' with the impact of last year 's vat rise fast disappearing from the year - on - year figure , next month 's figure will flatter the @entity121 much less			1
' falling inflation has provided a small boost to beleaguered savers who have seen their nest eggs cannibalised over recent years			0
with the @entity44 base rate held at a historic low of 0.5 per cent for three years in a row , savers struggled to open accounts that keep up with the rate of inflation			0
today a basic rate taxpayer needs an account that pays 4.25 per cent interest just to keep up with the rate of inflation			0
a higher rate 40 per cent taxpayer must achieve a rate of 5.66 per cent			0
in order to achieve that , savers will need to use tax - free isas or lock up their money over the long term			0
a survey today revealed 87 per cent of people are concerned about the effect of inflation on their income			0
a third of people ( 33 per cent ) believe inflation will rise over the next three years , according to @entity186			0
just 15 per cent believe it will go down			0
over half of people - 53 per cent - do not know what the current rate of inflation is			1
@entity192 , director of savings and investments at @entity186 , said : ' today ’s inflation announcement will serve as a welcome relief for @entity125 savers			0
' ' with @entity198 at 3.7 per cent today , is still higher than the 10 year average of 3.1 per cent and five year average of 3.5 per cent			1
' improvement : £ 10.7bn was lent in february - up 14 per cent on the same period last year mortgage lending is up 14 per cent in the last year as first - time buyers rush to purchase properties before the stamp duty amnesty ends this weekend			1
banks provided £ 10.7billion in february and mortgage lending has now been higher year - on - year for the last seven months in a row , the @entity206 said today			1
from saturday , the two - year stamp duty holiday for first - time buyers purchasing homes worth between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000 comes to an end			0
the looming deadline has prompted a recent surge of interest from this sector of the market , according to lenders and estate agents , who have called for the holiday to be extended			0
the latest lending figure is ' almost identical ' to the january , when £ 10.65 billion was lent			0
@entity206 chief economist @entity222 said : ' although a seasonal decline is expected over the winter months , our forward estimates suggest that february was the seventh month in a row of higher year - on - year lending			1
' this indicates that lending for house purchase remains brisk in advance of the ending of the stamp duty concession			0
' mr @entity222 said the pick - up in activity also appears to mark ' a more generalised improvement ' across the market , perhaps reflecting hopes that the squeeze on household incomes caused by high bills and tough employment conditions is easing off			0
he said : ' this may reflect household sentiment stabilising in anticipation of a recovery in real incomes , but wider economic uncertainties make it difficult to judge how well the upturn will persist			0
' he said a scheme recently launched by the government to help buyers purchase a new - build property had the potential to offset the expected dip caused by the ending of the stamp duty concession			1
the @entity258 scheme enables first - time buyers and home - movers to purchase a new - build home with a deposit of only 5 per cent or 10 per cent , rather than the 20 per cent often demanded by lenders , although this will do little to help those trying to buy or sell an existing property			0
mr @entity222 said : ' the launch of the @entity258 scheme is an important addition to lenders ' toolkit in addressing the various needs of would - be borrowers			0
' the scheme has the potential to offset the dip in first - time buyer activity that the end of the stamp duty concession on march 24 may produce			0

@entity279 was less than expected and there are fears over rising oil prices
