@entity10 's mother @entity30 said the legal system in @entity14 is making life extremely difficult for her family , despite having a great deal of help from officials in @entity12 , and her son is the victim not the perpetrator			1

' at the end of the day , @entity10 's now facing three charges , possibly a permanent criminal record , and maybe time in a @entity4 jail ' , she continued			2
' we 're living through this every day , @entity10 and i , either we 're sitting here just crying our eyes out holding each other or we 're working on the case			2

he has been told by doctors he will never make a full physical recovery			0
six weeks after he was viciously attacked , counter charges were filed against @entity10			1
these charges accused the young man of instigating the altercation , but @entity10 's mother @entity30 believes there is something more sinister at play behind the scenes			1
however , police have admitted there is no evidence to back up these counter-claims , and the @entity104 of @entity4 have also been involved in the case and believe a blunt weapon was also involved in the attack			0
in a victim impact statement he sent to @entity34 and @entity37 's future colleges in the @entity110 , @entity10 outlined the severe and brutal nature of the alleged attack by the pair			2
' i had no ability to defend myself as i was hit with a cowards punch , as i did not see the punches coming , i was completely oblivious to the situation			0
' to add further injury and to send some kind of message , one of them dealt the final blow when i was on the ground about to black out , causing me to lose total consciousness , ' he wrote			0
@entity10 , seen here being transported from @entity14 to @entity12 , has been recovering in the months following the attack the 20 - year - old had counter charges filed against him which accuse the young man of instigating the attack ' when i regained some consciousness after this horrific attack , i found myself bleeding profusely from my right eye and mouth area missing teeth bone and gum tissue			1
' @entity10 also wrote about the impact the assault would have on the rest of his life			2
' i intended to move back to @entity11 to embark on a new chapter of my life and reconnect with family ... ' both attackers have been charged by the police with intent to cause grievous bodily harm			0
they have also been hit with a private criminal lawsuit			0
' my family and i spend every day trying to fight ... when all i want to do is be given time to rest and hopefully heal			0
it is time someone takes a stance against violence			0
' ms @entity30 revealed @entity157 launched a full disciplinary inquiry into the case , and requested the above impact statement			1
they have suspended @entity37 for a year			0
@entity163 where @entity34 is set to attend responded to the documents saying as the incident occurred before he had commenced classes at the establishment , they would not suspend him			0
ms @entity30 revealed the struggle to get justice for her son , saying @entity10 would go to prison rather than admitting guilt to something he did n't do on the account of @entity10 's brother @entity175 , the night his sibling was beaten @entity10 headed out to a club called @entity16 with a girl he had met earlier in the day			1
@entity175 , 24 , and some of their friends were also at the establishment			0
when @entity10 arrived at the club , he was approached by two men who claimed the girl was with them			2
@entity175 told @entity186 footage from the evening shows his brother walking away without any trouble			0
later in the evening @entity10 was blindsided by two attackers and the bashing left him missing three teeth from his disfigured jaw , with blood spilling from his mouth and face			2
ms @entity30 said there has been suspicious and questionable circumstances surrounding her son 's case			1
@entity10 's mother said she witnessed the public prosecutor in a meeting with the families of the two accused , which an army official told her was a ' highly irregular ' occurrence			2
' we 're not playing that game , the charges against @entity10 do n't exist ' , ms @entity30 said			1
' @entity10 has said he will go to prison than plead guilty to something did not do			0
