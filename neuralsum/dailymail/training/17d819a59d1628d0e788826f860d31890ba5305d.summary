by @entity0 last updated at 5:03 pm on 8th february 2012 the tumultuous battle for the @entity3 presidential nomination took a dramatic twist last night when @entity5 won three stunning victories and delivered a major blow to @entity10 â€™s @entity9 ambitions			1
speaking in @entity12 , @entity13 , mr @entity5 , former senator for @entity15 , declared : ' i do n't stand here as the conservative alternative to @entity10 , i stand here as the conservative alternative to @entity19			1
' mr @entity5 won by 30 points in @entity13			2
he beat mr @entity10 into third place in @entity22 , behind representative @entity23 of @entity24 , the maverick libertarian			1
and he added that ' conservatism is alive and well in @entity13 and @entity22 ' by declaring that on health care to ' @entity29 bailouts , @entity10 has the same positions as @entity19 '			1
he beat @entity10 into third place in @entity22 , behind representative @entity23 of @entity24 , the maverick libertarian in @entity39 , where mr @entity10 was a heavy favourite , mr @entity5 won by five points			1
the night was also a poor one for @entity42 , who failed to get on the ballot in @entity13 , finished fourth in @entity22 and a distant third in @entity39			1
he now finds his claim to be the only conservative who can beat mr @entity10 seriously undermined			1
democrats will be buoyed by the results , which indicate a continuing and brutal primary battle that could seriously weaken mr @entity10 if he emerges as the nominee or lead to the candidate facing president @entity19 coming from the right wing of the @entity3			1
the results of the contests , however , are only symbolic because no delegates were at stake			0
celebrations : mr @entity5 greets supporters after speaking at a primary night watch party in @entity12 , @entity13 battle : @entity10 ( left ) speaks to supporters in @entity62 , @entity39 , as @entity23 talks during a campaign rally at @entity65 , @entity22 ( right ) battle ground : in @entity39 , where @entity10 was a heavy favourite , @entity5 won by five points the @entity10 campaign has insisted it is concentrating on amassing delegates and is unconcerned by ' beauty contests '			1
mr @entity10 held only one event in @entity22 and did not campaign in @entity13			1
@entity13 : @entity5 - 55 % @entity10 - 25 % @entity23 - 12 % @entity39 : @entity5 - 40 % @entity10 - 35 % @entity42 - 13 % @entity23 - 12 % @entity22 : @entity5 - 45 % @entity23 - 27 % @entity10 - 17 % @entity42 - 11 % * results of the @entity39 and @entity22 @entity3 caucuses and the @entity3 ( non-binding ) @entity13 primary earlier on tuesday , mr @entity5 said he thought the day could mark a turning point in the race			1
' i feel great that @entity22 is going to change the direction of this race tonight , ' he said in @entity35 , @entity22			0
mr @entity10 has committed time and financial resources to states across the country in preparation for ' @entity86 ' on march 6 and retains a major financial advantage			1
so it remained to be seen whether the night would be anything more than a temporary setback			0
in a memo released yesterday morning , @entity92 , mr @entity10 's political director , anticipating defeats , played down the day			1
he said : ' of course , there is no way for any nominee to win first place in every single contest			0
@entity100 lost 19 states in 2008 , and we expect our opponents to notch a few wins too			0
' after last night 's results , mr @entity5 showed no sign of disappointment when speaking to supporters in @entity62			0
he said : ' this was a good night for @entity5			0
i want to congratulate @entity5 , but i expect to become the nominee with your help			0
' @entity13 's @entity3 senator @entity3 , a @entity10 supporter , also congratulated the winner but highlighted that the delegates were still up for grabs			1
he said : ' @entity10 has the organisation and the resources to go the distance in this election , and i believe he 'll ultimately win our party 's nomination			1
' child 's play : youngsters entertained themselves in front of the stage before last night 's primary watch party for @entity5 in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity129 dream : @entity130 , 6 , showed off the @entity129 flag as he and his family waited for @entity3 presidential candidate @entity5 in @entity35 , @entity22 show your support : a woman picks out a @entity5 for president button as she arrives at his victory party at the @entity139 in @entity12 , @entity13 , last night as @entity144 might have remarked : " to lose a primary in @entity13 , mr @entity10 , may be regarded as a misfortune ; to lose a primary in @entity13 and a caucus in @entity22 looks like carelessness			1
" and to lose a caucus in @entity39 as well is a real disaster			0
this could have been the kind of script @entity150 would have conjured up for a @entity3 primary but it certainly was n't the script that @entity10 drafted			1
on election night in @entity158 , after scoring an impressive 15 - point victory in @entity158 and trampling @entity42 into the ground , the hope in @entity156 was that february would be a sweep with momentum and organisation carrying the day			1
pounded : @entity10 is once again on the defensive after he was handed embarrassing defeats in three state tuesday night all that 's changed now			1
a win in @entity22 or @entity13 could have been explained away as an aberration			0
but @entity39 was a state that @entity10 won by 60 points to 18 over @entity100 in 2008 and where he campaigned and spent money this time			1
@entity5 won it by five points			0
beneficiary : president @entity19 could be the real winner as the @entity3 seemingly tear themselves apart for @entity5 to win all three states is a real stunner			1
what does it mean ? well , @entity10 remains the favourite but it 's going to be a long and brutal spring			1
@entity5 should put his tin helmet on and prepare for a negative barrage of the type @entity184 suffered in @entity158			0
@entity10 's reference to " those who have been compromised by the culture of @entity188 " is a hint at a major line of attack - earmarks			1
we 'll doubtless hear a lot too about @entity5 's 18 - point drubbing in his home ( and swing ) state of @entity15 in 2006			0
money will flow to @entity5 but he will also attract a lot more scrutiny			0
@entity10 is in a real bind though - the negative campaign he ran in @entity158 was successful in the @entity158 but clearly had serious ramifications afterwards			1
going to hard against @entity5 , a much more likeable character than @entity184 , could backfire			0
tonight is a serious blow for @entity10 but he 's still the overwhelming favourite to prevail			1
as @entity206 argues here , he 's the only candidate with a national organisation capable of grinding out the 1,144 delegates needed			0
there were no actual delegates at stake tonight ( though the delegates chosen in @entity22 and @entity39 wil closely reflect tonight 's results )			0
disaster : @entity10 's camp predicted the end of the road for @entity42 who fared even worse tonight , placing a distance third in @entity39 and fourth in @entity22 in @entity220 on @entity86 ( march 6th ) , only @entity10 and @entity23 are on the ballot			1
in 2008 , @entity19 prevailed over @entity222 because he had a superior strategy to net delegates			0
@entity10 is on track to do the same this time around			2
@entity10 's chief strategist @entity226 emailed me tonight : " rather win than lose but no delegates awarded and we 're pretty tough minded about these things			2
focused on @entity86 and delegates			0
" it 's true that @entity226 always anticipated a bloody war of attrition and was focussed on delegates from the get go			0
but the margin of @entity5 's victories in @entity13 and @entity22 was extraordinary			0
these were not just squeakers			0
in @entity13 , @entity5 won 55 percent of the vote compared to @entity10 's 25 percent - and 250,000 republicans turned out			2
@entity10 was relegated to third place in @entity22			2
trucking along : @entity23 came in second in @entity22 , with 27 percent , but place third and fourth in @entity13 and @entity39 , respectively obviously , this speaks to considerable conservative doubt about @entity10			1
certainly , the clear front runner can and often is punished by @entity3 voters , as @entity100 was in 2008			2
but it 's a little bit early in this process to be taking about any kind of buyer 's remorse phenomenon - the sale has n't yet been made			0
@entity42 is in real trouble			2
@entity226 finished his email to me with : " and it does really kill @entity42 , which is amusing			2
" @entity184 was n't organised enough to get on the ballot in @entity13 and he finished fourth in @entity22 and a distant third in @entity39			2
he 's won one state and @entity5 has won four			0
he can no longer claim to be the principal conservative alternative to @entity10			2
ironically , @entity184 may be @entity10 's immediate saviour			2
his remaining in the race ( as he surely will ) splits the conservative vote			0
the problem for both @entity184 and @entity10 that the @entity42 vote really starts to tank			1
i would n't put it past @entity10 to start praising @entity184			2
this should have been a bad week for @entity19			0
he 's made a disastrous mistake by alienating the @entity270			0
he executed a stunning u-turn today on super pacs			0
but all that has been eclipsed by tonight 's @entity5 sweep			0
the @entity9 will still believe that @entity10 will be the ultimate nominee but hope and expect that he will be seriously damaged in the process			2
their dream of dreams , of course , would be that @entity184 or @entity5 somehow emerge from this circus as the victor , judging that both are too far to the @entity283 to win in november			0
@entity10 may be counting on @entity86 but he 's been thrown for a loop by this tuesday			2
for the time being at least , @entity285 means that chaos will reign in this extraordinary @entity3 contest .			1

@entity3 nomination fight in chaos as @entity10 is handed three crushing defeats
@entity42 fared even worst with third and fourth places
