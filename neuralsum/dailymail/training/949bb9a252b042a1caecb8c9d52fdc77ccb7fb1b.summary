by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 24 june 2013 assurance : @entity2 said @entity3 will introduce marriage tax break a tax break for married couples will be delivered before the next general election , the @entity5 promised yesterday			1
@entity2 , the exchequer secretary , stressed that @entity3 plans to introduce a transferable tax allowance for spouses ‘ in due course ’			1
the assurance comes amid a growing rebellion by backbenchers over the tax break , which had been promised by @entity15			2
@entity16 , a former children ’s minister , tabled an amendment to the chancellor ’s @entity18 , demanding that the tax break be written into law now to show voters that the @entity22 are serious about supporting the family			1
an alliance of rebel mps had also tabled a separate @entity26 to introduce the tax break			1
many within the party have been troubled by @entity30 opposition and foot - dragging from the chancellor over the @entity32 ’ flagship family policy – but a letter to @entity32 @entity25 from mr @entity2 states : ‘ the prime minister has always been clear that it is important to recognise marriage in the tax system , and this firm commitment remains			1
’ he points out that ‘ the conservative manifesto at the last general election set out our policy to introduce a transferable tax allowance of £ 750 between spouses and civil partners ’			1
he also reminds mps that ‘ our commitment to a transferable tax allowance was restated ’ in the @entity50			1
‘ the prime minister and chancellor have consistently made clear that we remain committed to recognising marriage in the tax system , ’ mr @entity2 wrote			1
‘ i know that many of you will have heard the chancellor set out his commitment to deliver on this during the course of this @entity61			0
making promises : both prime minister @entity15 and chancellor @entity3 have pledged that the tax allowance for spouses will be written into law , but it has yet to emerge couples benefit : the ' marriage tax break ' which also covers civil partners , would see a transferable tax allowance of £ 750 between spouses ‘ an announcement on details of how we will legislate for this in this @entity61 will be made by the chancellor in due course			1
’ the development suggests that ministers are growing jittery over fury in @entity32 ranks that the pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system has taken a back seat , while mr @entity15 has pushed through gay marriage against the wishes of grassroots members			2
head rebel : @entity32 mp @entity16 demands the ' marriage tax law ' be written before the election @entity32 whips have already urged mr @entity16 and his fellow rebels to back down			2
the former minister dismissed mr @entity2 ’s attempt to mollify backbenchers , saying they are ‘ tired of waiting ’ for the policy to become law			2
‘ the phrase “ in due course ” is meaningless , ’ he added			0
‘ the letter does n’t say anything that has n’t been said before			0
there are only so many times the @entity5 can peddle this line			0
‘ this was a clear manifesto pledge			2
there is absolutely no reason why we should n’t get on with it			0
‘ it is what people expect from this government and there ’s absolutely no reason why we have this continual foot - dragging			0
’ many @entity32 mps blame mr @entity3 for the delay , even though he has repeatedly told right - wingers in private that he will go ahead with the plans			1
@entity117 , who tabled the @entity26 , pointed the finger at the @entity30 , who are allowed to abstain in any vote on a marriage tax break			0
he said : ‘ obviously the @entity30 have been blocking it			0
it ’s about time we stopped kow - towing to them and do things that conservatives want			0
‘ this is something that goes to the heart of conservatism and we should n’t worry about what @entity131 say			0

exchequer secretary @entity2 promised @entity3 would keep pledge
rebel mps say it is needed to show that @entity22 are serious about family
