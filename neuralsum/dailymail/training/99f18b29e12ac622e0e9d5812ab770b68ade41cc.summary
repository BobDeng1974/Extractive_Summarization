experts suggest that by exercising more and eating healthily we could live to the age of 120 scientists have n't quite figured how we can live forever - but they now say they have worked out how we could make it to 120			1
experts suggest that exercising more , eating healthily and taking statins is the key to slowing the ageing process			1
although a ' wonder - pill ' is not in sight , making lifestyle changes such as cutting down on sugar , salt and fat and taking drugs that already exist might work , says the @entity16			1
the group , which independently monitors evidence that explain changes in life expectancy and advises policymakers , found doing so took the average lifespan from 80 to 84			2
the ' what is ageing ? and how do we delay it ? ' report states that at present few people live to around 110 - but by making these adjustments they predict that the healthiest individuals could live to 120			1
it explains that ageing happens because of problems in cell division - an essential function which leads to growth , organ development and the replacement of damaged cells			2
but it is errors that occur in this natural process that impacts on ageing , according to experts , along with lifestyle factors like smoking and drinking			1
@entity49 is said to cause a rise in cell mutation because it speeds up cell division			0
when cells divide they also shorten the protective caps called telomeres and consequently once they reach a certain size they stop dividing entirely			0
this process is known as senescence , which when it is built up in an organ it prevents the ability to repair damage and causes wrinkles and age spots			0
but the panel found this process can be slowed down by eating well , exercising and taking drugs which impact on pathways in the body			1
dame @entity71 , chair of the @entity16 , said : ' from this research we have been able to build up a picture of the latest developments in this area			2
' the experts tended to agree on which possible factors are important in understanding the biology of ageing			2
' however , they did not necessarily agree on which are the most important components of the ageing process , or on which interventions might have the greatest potential for extending lifespan			0
' tests revealed that a @entity90 diet and possible calorie restriction lowered the incidence of age - related disease			1
a figure from the study which shows the percentage reduction in average mortality rate attributable to dietary restriction in laboratory animals and a projection of how this may translate for humans ( @entity104 et al 2012 ) drugs such as statins , which have an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to lowering cholesterol , were also found to delay the ageing process			1
while the drug rapamycin , which has been shown to regulate cell division , increased the lifespan of mice by up to 26 per cent			0
and resveratrol , which comes from red wine and is sold in dietary supplements , extended the life in simple animals such as yeast , nematodes and killifish , but results have been inconsistent in other animals including mice and flies			0
eating healthily - including a @entity90 diet - has been said to extent life expectancy , according to experts @entity130 , professor of @entity131 at the @entity132 , told @entity133 that living healthier for longer was more important than increasing lifespan			1
' ageing occurs because the mechanisms which keep us in good health fail over time			0
' after a variable number of divisions , cells will stop dividing and start to do bad stuff			0
' so , in effect , all age related diseases are being driven by a few mechanisms which if you could control them , could be the difference between somebody hobbling down the street , or jogging past you			0
' according to the @entity155 , life - expectancy at birth in @entity154 increased between 1981 and 2010 from 71 to 78 in men and 77 to 82 in women			0
the panel concluded that longevity will continue to increase in the next 10 years but the rate is likely to slow down .			2

making lifestyle changes like cutting down on sugar and salt help longevity
experts from @entity16 say healthiest people could live to 120
eating well , exercising more and taking drugs like statins were beneficial
scientists found @entity90 diet and calorie restriction help live longer
