@entity3 stands back as referee @entity25 calls the count over opponent @entity0 but @entity0 believes the cynicism will disappear when @entity4 stages the @entity5 - just like it did four decades ago when he was knocked out by @entity3 in the @entity29 capital @entity30			1
' @entity7 had the same reputation as being out of the way but once we got there there were modern hotels and everything else , ' @entity0 said			2

@entity3 cops a left hook to the face from @entity0 during the pair 's famous ' @entity2 ' bout in @entity7 ' the country has so much to offer and there 's a lot of things for the tourists to see			1
' they do great business and put on great events and the @entity5 will highlight it like nothing else			0
' the whole world is frightened of going to new places and that 's why you put on big sporting events , they ca n't resist it			2
' they must come and see it and that 's why sports are so important			0
@entity3 yells ' @entity68 ' before his fight which translates from @entity7 's @entity71 dialect as ' i will kill him ' ' there 's a lot of ignorance but once you can show the world what you can do it shows you 're the same as everyone else			1
' last week marked the 40th anniversary of the classic contest between @entity3 and @entity0 which still resonates today			1
the unusual venue and build - up to the fight marked it out as something special and the combatants duly delivered in the ring as @entity3 upset the odds and the fearsome @entity0 with an eighth - round knock - out to become the heavyweight champion of the world for the third time at the age of 32			1
