when @entity1 discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession , she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy			2
‘ i ’m a size eight and have always had a flat stomach , but when i had my first daughter i found it really difficult to get it back , ’ says @entity1 , 29 , a beauty therapist and mother to @entity8 , 20 months , and @entity9 , four months			2
‘ my muscles were non-existent , everything stuck out and it was six months before i could wear a t - shirt because of my jelly belly			1
i felt really self - conscious and did n’t even like looking in the mirror			2
‘ i knew that with your second baby everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already weakened , so i started looking for something to help			2
’ the big squeeze : @entity25 and her corset to most women , that might be a gym membership , a sharp swerve away from the biscuit aisle in the supermarket or a brisk walk with the buggy each day			1
but , like a growing number of mothers , @entity1 wanted results more quickly than that			2
shopping in @entity38 , she chanced upon what she saw as a solution to her problems — a @entity42			1
this is a huge band of thick , strong elastic that ’s worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly , waist and hips			1
it is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles , to reduce swelling and stretch marks , and support the spine			1
similar compression garments are called @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity60 wrap			2
the trend is huge in the @entity62 and is becoming popular here , despite warnings that it can be damaging to women ’s health			1
@entity1 strapped herself into the @entity42 just three days after giving birth			1
‘ i wore it day and night — i was pretty determined			2
and it was so expensive , around £ 70 , that i wanted to get my money ’s worth , ’ she says			2
‘ i found it comfortable and even slept in it			2
my partner , @entity74 , did n’t mind it			2
he knew i wanted to feel good in my clothes			2
’ @entity1 , who lives in the @entity77 , says she was ‘ gobsmacked ’ at the results			2
‘ within two weeks i was a size ten and could wear a tight t - shirt			1
i really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic - floor floor muscles , even though i was n’t doing any exercise			2
‘ it took me six weeks to get back to a size eight and a weight of eight stone			2
i never thought it would be so dramatic			2
’ @entity25 shows off her unbelievably tiny waist which she achieved by wearing her compression girdle			1
initially worn to support her back after having a @entity90 , @entity25 still wears it if she wants to wear a certain dress to help cinch in her waist and yummy belly - binding is rooted in ancient tradition			1
in @entity99 , the @entity97 and @entity98 , it is normal for women to wear a compressing wrap , corset or girdle to speed up their return to their pre-pregnancy size			1
its revival in the @entity108 has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements : the actress @entity110 credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to wearing two corsets , one on top of the other , day and night , for three months			0
@entity114 and @entity115 sang the praises of the @entity42 while @entity117 and @entity118 wore @entity57 , a £ 75 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops			1
while there ’s no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish , some experts warn against squeezing your post- pregnancy body back into shape			1
some obstetricians in the @entity62 say women are risking stress incontinence , digestion problems and weakened back muscles			1
@entity133 , a women ’s health physiotherapist at the @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 , says : ‘ after giving birth , the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy			1
‘ this will return to normal , but it takes time			0
the evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal distension is breast - feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the abdominals during and after pregnancy			1
‘ a belly - binder wo n’t help you lose baby fat — the only things to affect that are your metabolism and diet			1
if you bind the abdominal wall too tightly , you ’re putting your pelvic floor under pressure , which could lead to urinary leakage			1
the pelvic floor has just been through a big stretch , so the last thing it wants is to be pressured			0
’ @entity118 wore @entity57 which is a £ 75 wrap sold in upmarket maternity stores to help her return to her pre-baby shape after she had given birth the other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the tummy muscles , meaning deeper , core muscles become lazy			1
‘ if you give too much external support to the stomach , the abdominal and pelvic - floor muscles will be deterred from working as well , ’ says @entity133			0
‘ so , in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep yourself supported , rather than retraining your core muscles to do it			0
’ @entity184 tried two belly binders following the birth of her daughter @entity187			1
‘ as i ’m 41 , i was aware my body could go south after i had a baby , ’ says @entity184 , who works in finance and is married to @entity189 , 45			0
‘ the rest of me is fairly flabby , but my stomach has always been flat			0
so i really wanted to try to hold on to it			0
i was reading online mothers ’ forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding			1
‘ i remember reading about @entity110 doing it and that really stuck in my mind			0
i ended up buying @entity57 and some @entity58 shapewear			0
’ two days after her daughter was born , @entity184 strapped herself into @entity57 , but struggled to get used to it			0
‘ @entity187 was born on one of the hottest days of the year , so it was uncomfortable			0
it was also very obvious			0
if i was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes			1
‘ it ’s recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day , which seemed like madness			1
‘ in the end , i had to take it off every time i wanted to feed @entity187 because i simply was n’t comfortable sitting in it			0
’ after two weeks , @entity184 decided to try the @entity58 , a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line			0
‘ this was even worse			0
it had hook and eye fastenings , so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out			0
the fat has got to go somewhere , has n’t it ? i looked like an overstuffed sausage			0
’ yet the internet is awash with ‘ miracle ’ stories about women racing to get back into their pre-pregnancy clothes			1
mother - of - two @entity237 wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies			0
@entity117 , pictured left , wore the @entity57 to help return to her famously beautiful body shape while @entity115 , pictured right with her son , @entity244 , wore another brand called the @entity246 ‘ i ’m a small build , so i did n’t put on much weight , but my muscles were weak and i was looking for something to support my back , ’ says @entity25 , 40 , a graphic designer who lives with her husband @entity248 , 45 , a sales director , and their children in @entity251			1
‘ i loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when i was back in my size - ten jeans within two weeks of giving birth			0
’ when @entity25 had her son , now three , she had to have an emergency caesarean			0
without discussing it with her midwife , she used a girdle designed for post c - section bellies , with side - fastening eyehooks			0
‘ it sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable			0
i think it also helped the scar to heal , in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it , ’ she says			0
@entity25 still occasionally wears her compression garment			0
‘ i will put it on if i want to wear a certain dress			1
it helps cinch in my waist and tum			1
’ at 13 inches , @entity289 ’s waist was the smallest ever recorded			1
she appeared on the cover of @entity291 however , despite such reports , the belly - binding trend worries midwives , who feel women are under too much pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy			1
@entity300 , who leads the @entity301 ’ policy on obesity and maternal public health issues , says : ‘ it is far better to lose your pregnancy weight gradually , by eating healthily and taking gentle exercise , such as swimming , with your baby			1
‘ women who are pregnant or who have just given birth should be celebrated , not hidden away			1
we ’re at risk of making women feel guilty about their bodies			1
’ @entity184 , who had suffered an abdominal split — where the muscles do not reconnect properly after birth — ditched the two different belly binders and saw a physiotherapist			2
‘ she gave me some pilates and pelvic - floor exercises , which are helping			0
i just do n’t think there ’s a quick fix , ’ she says			0
and like many new mothers , @entity184 found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities			0
‘ i have n’t worried about my stomach as much as i thought i would , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity187 is my focus			0
all i cared about was being able to feed her , to cuddle her and feel her skin on mine			0
yes , my tummy is probably a bit squishy , but it ’s all worth it for her			0
