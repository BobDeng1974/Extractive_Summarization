by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 5 november 2013 if there ’s one thing we ’ve learnt from the internet , it ’s that domestic cats are curious about their surroundings			0
there are hundreds of online videos of felines investigating everything from treadmills to printers			0
and their big cousins on the @entity17 savannah are just as inquisitive			0
evidence for this has arrived in the form of a video in which a cheetah wanders up to the @entity24 camera filming it – and licks the lens			1
the @entity39 camera had been placed on the ground by wildlife expert @entity41 , from @entity42 , and pointed towards two cheetahs resting near a bush			1
at the start of the footage one them wanders slowly over to the camera and begins sniffing it			1
and after a few seconds it lies down and gives it a good lick			1
perhaps it thought it would taste good – or maybe the spot clean was carried out over concern there was some dirt on the lens that would ruin shots of it looking magnificent			1
after all , we also know that cats take their looks very seriously			0
after a short time something appears to spook the cheetah , though , and it suddenly gets up , turns and sprints back to its friend			2
got it licked : the cheetah gives internet users a brilliant close - up of its tongue off and running : something spooks the cheetah after a short while and it sprints back to its companion in the wild cheetahs are found in @entity17 and @entity79 , with their name deriving from the @entity82 word @entity83 – which translates as ‘ the spotted one ’			2
they are , of course , famed for their speed – and have been clocked hitting 70mph for short bursts			0
this means that their favoured prey of gazelles , impalas , antelopes and birds often do n’t stand a chance of escape .			0

the @entity39 camera was set up by @entity42 guide @entity41
the cheetah licks the lens for a good few seconds before sprinting off
