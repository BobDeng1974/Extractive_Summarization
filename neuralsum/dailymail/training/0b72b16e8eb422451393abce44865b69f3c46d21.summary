by @entity0 a council has been slammed after a single bus lane camera made more than £ 250,000 in just ten months			1
between march and december last year , a staggering 6,259 tickets were handed to motorists who were filmed straying into the lane - an average of around 20 per day			1
the camera , on @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , generated £ 250,850 in fines , dwarfing the average income of £ 38,000 from the city 's other bus lane cameras			1
this bus lane camera ( top left ) in @entity9 raked in more than £ 250,000 in ten months			1
locals are accusing the council of running a ' money - making racket ' this has attracted claims the camera is being used as a cash cow to boost council coffers			0
@entity24 , an attendant at a nearby petrol station , said : ' it 's just a money - making racket			0
people know they should not go in the lane and they do n't go in it unless they have to			2
' motorists face a £ 30 fine for using the bus lane , rising to £ 60 if they fail to pay within 14 days			1
figures show the camera generated £ 12,514 in its first month			1
fines peaked at £ 52,060 in april before declining steadily to £ 6,270 in november			2
the figure rose again to £ 11,910 in december			0
the camera , positioned to the left of the bus lane , catches out motorists on @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
motorists say the camera is ' unfairly positioned ' a spokesman for the @entity44 said : ' it looks like the council gave lots of @entity49 shoppers a nice little memento of their journey into @entity9			0
' he said fines were acceptable for inconsiderate drivers but there needed to be ' discretion ' shown towards motorists who strayed into the lane , especially to allow emergency vehicles past			2
local businessman @entity60 , who uncovered the figures following a @entity63 request , said the camera was unfairly positioned			1
' it 's situated too close to the end of the bus lane and films those who drift into the lane to make a permitted left turn , ' he said			1
' the focus is set directly in front of the camera itself so it captures people cutting the last few yards of the bus lane to make the turn			1
' the 41 - year - old property consultant was given a penalty charge notice after straying into the lane on august 6 last year			2
mr @entity60 was set to argue he should not be forced to pay because he was in the lane for less than 20 metres - a distance he said was permissible under the rules set out by other councils			1
he wrote to the council asking for more information - but was told his appeal had been rejected before he had even made his case			0
however , after taking the matter to a traffic penalty tribunal , his ticket was overturned			0
the adjudicator in the case slammed the council for rejecting mr @entity60 's appeal			2
a written judgement said the council had ' paid no regard at all to the possibility that he might wish to raise mitigation ' in his defence			0
it added : ' the council are obliged , of course , to consider not only if there was a contravention but , if and only if there was , what other information might mitigate it			0
' rejection only because there was a contravention is the wrong approach to their duty under the regulations			0
' figures show 136 of the 6,259 tickets issued in relation to the same camera last year were cancelled as the result of appeals			0
mr @entity60 said : ' there 's clearly a rush on the part of the council to get their hands on the money as soon as possible			2
i 'm virtually certain that there are many other people who would have legitimate grounds to appeal			0
' a @entity130 spokesman said : ' the bus lanes throughout @entity9 are part of the city 's commitment to reduce congestion and improve public transport links			0
' we closely monitor the impact of bus lane enforcement in different locations to make sure the measures we have taken are delivering the best possible outcomes for road users			1
' he added that the decline in fines being issued showed drivers were getting the message .			0
