@entity1 ’s family have been offered a state funeral after @entity4 prime minister @entity3 called his death the ‘ greatest loss for cricket since the loss of @entity9 ’			1
the former @entity11 captain and legendary broadcaster died on wednesday at the age of 84 following a battle with skin cancer			1
@entity3 said : ‘ there would be very few @entity4 who have not passed a summer in the company of @entity1			1
@entity1 was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge @entity1 was the voice of cricket for generations , commentating in his native @entity11 and for the @entity25 @entity4 prime minister @entity3 has offered @entity1 's family a state funeral @entity1 , pictured on his wedding day to wife @entity29 , and during his time as @entity11 captain @entity1 was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests ‘ he was the accompaniment of an @entity4 summer , his voice was even more present than the chirping of the cicadas in our suburbs and towns , and that voice , tragically , is now still			1
but we remember him with tremendous affection			1
’ state funerals in @entity11 are generally reserved for politicians			1
even @entity9 himself turned down the offer of one before his death in 2001			1
but such is the esteem in which @entity1 was held , both as an engaging all - round cricketer – he took 248 @entity55 wickets with his leg - breaks and scored 2,201 runs – and as a commentator , that @entity3 has been moved to make an exception			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity1 assembled a formidable line - up for the @entity25 in 1995 a master with the microphone to his lips , @entity1 also was well aware of the power of silence the tributes continued on friday to a man routinely referred to as ‘ the voice of cricket ’			1
his fellow leg - spinner @entity72 said , ‘ for me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor ’ , while @entity78 described his death as a ‘ great loss to the world of cricket ’			1
@entity11 ’s @entity55 captain @entity82 praised @entity1 for helping ‘ the @entity4 team have the attitude where they wanted to win			1
he played the game the right way ’			1
one of @entity82 ’s predecessors , @entity89 , said : ‘ his legacy to the game will always live on			1
’ the veteran @entity4 radio commentator @entity91 said : ‘ he has been the most influential , revered and respected person in the game for 50 years			1
as @entity4 captain he never lost a series			1
as a commentator he was precise , authoritative and deliciously understated			2
’ @entity1 , pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book @entity97 , was widely respected and loved @entity1 pays tribute to @entity4 media mogul and cricket pioneer @entity100 after his death in 2005 @entity102 ' what i want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that , when i say something , i am talking to friends			1
' ' my mantra is : put your brain into gear and if you can add to what 's on the screen then do it , otherwise shut up			2
' ' the key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see			2
' ' out in the field , you have n't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things , you 've got to do it yourself			2
' @entity131 ' the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss , at the right time			2
' ' captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill			2
but do n't try it without that 10 per cent			2
' @entity141 ' @entity142 is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the @entity147 to hold a convention			2
' ' @entity149 dismissed for two , just ninety - eight runs short of his century			2
' ' he 's not quite got hold of that one			0
if he had , it would have gone for nine			0
' @entity156 ' a bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner			0
' ' your wrist must be cocked , but not stiffly cocked			0
' ' you must always look where you want to land it			0
if i offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can , you 'd never take your eyes off it			0
' on @entity171 ' if any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it 's great for the sport			0
i think it 's wonderful			0
' ' as long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game i think it will be terrific			0
' on @entity72 's ' @entity186 ' @entity187 has absolutely no idea what has happened to it			0
' @entity192 1981 's ' @entity191 ' scandal ' a disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong			0
it should never be permitted to happen again			0
one of the worst things i have ever seen done on a cricket field			0
' miscellaneous ' the slow - motion replay does n't show how fast the ball was really travelling			0
' ' a cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it			0
' ' he 's usually a good puller - but he could n't get it up that time			0
' ' @entity210 has changed for the better ... it 's because of what happened then , cricket is so strong now			0
