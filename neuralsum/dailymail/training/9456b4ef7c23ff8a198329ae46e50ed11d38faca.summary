by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 19:27 est , 28 october 2012 experts fear a repeat of the devastation caused by @entity5 elm disease as an infection threatens a third of the country ’s trees			1
importing ash trees is to be banned monday , following the burning of 100,000 specimens with ash dieback			1
the fungal infection , which ravaged other @entity16 countries before spreading to the @entity17 , kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects			1
forest favourite : one of @entity17 's 80 million ash trees , which could soon be wiped out desperate measures are being taken to protect @entity17 ’s 80million ash trees , which support wildlife as well as the £ 10billion timber industry			1
experts believe it may already be too late to prevent an environmental catastrophe on the scale of the @entity5 elm disease outbreak that destroyed 25million trees in the @entity33 and @entity34			1
ministers have been criticised for failing to act earlier when the parasite was first detected in a nursery in february			1
it is now feared to have spread to 20 sites			2
@entity40 , @entity41 ’s environment spokesman , said the government – which only opened a consultation on ash dieback with businesses and scientists last month – had been ‘ asleep on the job ’			2
the disease was found at the start of the year in a consignment of 2,000 trees imported from the @entity5 , most of which had already been sold by the time the infection was detected			2
fungus : @entity56 can lay undetected for years before killing trees @entity58 crisis : the fungus now poses the greatest threat to @entity63 woodland since the 1970s last week the first cases in mature trees were confirmed in @entity66			2
saplings in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have also been affected			0
@entity56 ’s microscopic fungus – chalara fraxinea – infects the leaves , bark and wood of ash trees , causing them to develop black spots and cankers , and then wither and die			1
stop dieback : environment secretary @entity81 is ' ready to go ' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in @entity17 @entity81 , the environment secretary , said yesterday : ‘ we will be introducing a ban on imports			1
i have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go			0
’ the movement of saplings around the country will also be strictly controlled			0
a task force of 100 people from the @entity94 and other bodies are now tracing all ash imports into the @entity17 for the past five years – at thousands of sites – in an attempt to trace when the disease first arrived here			1
ash dieback has devastated mainland @entity16 , from where more than a million of @entity17 ’s ash trees have been imported over the past two years			1
it has all but wiped out common ash species in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
a survey has found 20 ‘ suspicious ’ sites in @entity17 , but they are yet to be confirmed by scientists			1
@entity112 , of the @entity94 , said it was a race against time to detect new cases before the falling of autumn leaves made them very difficult to track			0
there are concerns that the fungus may have been lurking undetected for several years , as it can take this long before it becomes apparent			2
scientists are not certain how it spreads , but they suspect it is carried by rain , wind or insects			0
about 58,000 trees have been burned in @entity71 so far , with a further 40,000 destroyed around the rest of the @entity17			1
the @entity131 said it first raised the issue of ash dieback in 2009 , when it called for import restrictions			0
at that stage the disease was thought to be caused by a fungus already endemic in @entity17 , making a ban ineffective			1
it has since been discovered that the fungus is a new one			0
@entity142 of the @entity131 said it was ‘ hugely disappointing ’ that the government had not acted more quickly			0
national tragedy : @entity146 is a £ 10 billion a year industry threatened by the ash dieback disease crisis ‘ we are looking for @entity150 [ the @entity150 ] to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as a result of this , ’ he added			2
@entity156 , of the @entity157 , said : ‘ we feel this has n’t been taken as seriously as it should			0
we should have an emergency summit like we had with foot and mouth disease			0
' this could rip massive holes in our landscape – it kills the tree , so it could easily be as bad as @entity5 elm disease			2
’ dame @entity170 , the outgoing director - general of the @entity171 , warned that an outbreak in the @entity17 could be ‘ horrific ’			2
‘ we ’re just praying that this ash dieback can be understood , and managed , quickly , ’ she said			0
@entity174 , president of the @entity175 , said it was a ‘ great pity ’ that an ash tree ban was not announced earlier in the year to prevent further imports from @entity16 , where the disease is rife			1
mr @entity81 denied that the @entity144 had taken too long to act , saying a ‘ detailed process ’ would be carried out at 1,000 sites to identify where trees had come from			1
environment secretary @entity81 said : ' as soon as the first case was confirmed in february , we immediately began to trace its source , so we could get it under control and minimise the spread of the disease			0
' we immediately arranged for any infected trees to be destroyed			0
' we held urgent talks with the industry about the impact of @entity56 resulting in a voluntary import ban			0
' i announced last week that a ban on the import of ash trees and movement controls within the @entity17 would come into force on monday / today , well before the planting season begins			1
' i have set up a new plant health task force which will look at further ways to prevents pests and diseases from entering the country in the future			0
