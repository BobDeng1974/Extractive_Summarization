dr @entity1 was ' dishonest and misleading ' when he found the newspaper vendor died of a heart attack after he had been hit by a police officer			1
today his medical tribunal identified 68 failings , including the key fact that dr @entity1 did not tell police that 47 - year - old mr @entity4 suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike			1
dr @entity1 ’s fitness to practise was impaired , panel members said , and he acted with ' deficient professional performance ' in his investigation when the father of nine was hit and pushed to the ground by pc @entity28 during the @entity5 protest in the @entity30 in april 2009			1
an inquest jury found that mr @entity4 had been unlawfully killed but @entity32 was later cleared of manslaughter			1
today the medical panel stated : ' the question of dishonesty is especially serious and the panel notes that you have previously been found to be dishonest in relation to your cv			2
' thus , the dishonesty found in mr @entity4 ’s case is even more significant than it would otherwise have been			1
' dr @entity1 carried out the first post mortem examination into the death and claimed mr @entity4 had died of coronary artery disease			1
the panel found that dr @entity1 did not properly consider or comment on the fact that abdominal bleeding found on mr @entity4 could have caused his collapse and death			1
upset : @entity4 's son @entity52 and @entity53 have been left distraught by his death and she said today @entity1 ' misled everyone ' they also found that the pathologist did not adequately explain how mr @entity4 could have died from a heart attack or properly consider any other possible non-natural causes of his death			1
after receiving new evidence , dr @entity1 compiled a second post-mortem report but again made a series of mistakes and incorrect conclusions , according to the panel			1

it is expected to last up to four weeks			0

the officer , 45 , from @entity113 in @entity114 , had a controversial disciplinary record before the fateful day when he came across mr @entity4			2
a series of allegations were made against him over a 12 - year period , and he was allowed to retire from the @entity93 on medical grounds in 2001 despite unresolved disciplinary proceedings			0
later , @entity28 rejoined the force as a civilian worker , before becoming a police officer for @entity114			0
he was then allowed to rejoin the @entity93 in 2004 as part of its @entity125 , specialising in public order			0
his original conclusions were challenged when video emerged of @entity32 , 45 , pushing mr @entity4 to the ground			2
further medical reports suggested that , in fact , he died from an injury to his liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest			2
the panel criticised dr @entity1 , who is suspended , for his ' closed mind set ' in dealing with the case and said he had ' deficiencies in the areas of observation , interpretation ... and in the conclusions you draw '			2
they found that dr @entity1 had ' brought the profession into disrepute ' and that his integrity could not be relied upon			2
he also breached one of the ' fundamental tenets of the profession ' through his dishonesty			0
panel chairman the rev @entity155 said : ' it is clearly in the interest of the general public that they should be able to have confidence in the coronial system and this confidence has been undermined by your failures			0
' having considered everything before it the panel has determined that your fitness to practise ... is impaired by reason of misconduct and deficient professional performance in the case of mr @entity4			1
' mr @entity4 ’s widow @entity173 said today : ' the incompetence and dishonesty of @entity1 helped @entity32 and gave us an uphill battle for justice from the start			1
' he misled everyone , saying that @entity4 had died of a heart attack when in fact he had died of internal bleeding			1
' it ’s good that people can see some of the things we have been up against			0
@entity1 has a lot to answer for and i would like to know why with all the good pathologists there are , he was selected to do the first post mortem			0
