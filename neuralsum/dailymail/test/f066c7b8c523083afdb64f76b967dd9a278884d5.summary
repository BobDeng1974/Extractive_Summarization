@entity0 tonight vowed to block the @entity1 imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future @entity5 deal			1
the deputy prime minister said he would not allow the @entity7 to prop @entity8 up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash £ 12billion from the benefits bill			1
in an interview on the @entity13 , mr @entity0 also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the @entity1 agreed new taxes on the rich			1
but the deputy prime minister defended his record in government with mr @entity8			1
asked if he was proud of his record in power , mr @entity0 said : ' @entity22			1
mr @entity0 's remarks come after the defence secretary @entity32 launched an extraordinary attack on @entity34 last week			1
mr @entity32 said the @entity29 leader had stabbed his brother in the back to win the leadership and was now ' willing to stab the @entity39 in the back to become prime minister ' by giving up the @entity43 missile system to secure the support of the @entity45			0
mr @entity0 ’s insistence that he will not go into @entity5 with the @entity1 if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the @entity7 could strike a deal with @entity29 after the election			1
however , the deputy prime minister said he would also veto a deal with mr @entity34 if @entity29 did not set out in more detail how they would slash the deficit			2
he said : ‘ i would n’t accept £ 12billion of welfare cuts			2
in exactly the same way that i could never countenance recommending to the @entity7 entering into a coalition with the @entity29 that is n’t serious about balancing the books rather than the specious stuff they ’ve come up with today			2
' equally i would not recommend to the @entity7 that we go into coalition with the conservatives if they insist on a plan which is a marked departure from what we ’ve done in this coalition			2
‘ they ’re asking for £ 12billion over two years			2
we ’ve made £ 20billion over five			0
they want to ask the poorest to make additional sacrifices whilst not asking the richest to pay an additional penny through the tax system to balance the books			0
’ in an interview on the @entity13 tonight , mr @entity0 said the price of another @entity5 would be new taxes on the rich and a scaling back of the prime minister ’s planned welfare cuts asked by host @entity79 if he felt ‘ betrayed ’ by the prime minister at any stage since 2010 , he pointed to the av referendum			1
he said : ‘ it was shoddy it was unnecessary i did n’t think they needed to win the argument by being quite so personal			0
i wish the referendum had been fought on its merits			0
‘ what i have learnt about the @entity64 – and you can see it in this election campaign – when they think they ’re about to lose their grip on something that they like , usually power , they can lash out , they ’re doing it in this election campaign because they realise they ’re not going to win it			0
’ but mr @entity0 said the @entity5 had been ‘ worth ’ all the pain			1
he said : ‘ yes , of course it has and any @entity7 will tell you that … we took the decision as a democratic party			0
and we decided that notwithstanding the impact on our short term political popularity it was the right thing for the country			0
‘ and a time when people are so cynical about politics , and so fed up with politicians is n’t it a good thing that a party , a plucky brave party put country before party and i have an old fashioned belief that if you do the right thing , that there are plenty of fair minded folk out there who will recognise that … was every decision a decision i would relish ? ' of course not			0
but is the country better now than it was when we found it on an economic precipice in 2010 , you bet			0

deputy @entity139 said he would block a new @entity5 deal over welfare cuts
he *pledged* to force @entity8 to impose new taxes on the *wealthy*
the @entity7 have called for £ *3bn* of new welfare *savings*

mr @entity0 said @entity1 now ' lashing out ' because they know they are losing
