@entity0 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in @entity5 ’s nuclear , transport and public services after suicide pilot @entity8 killed 150 people in the @entity11 plane crash disaster			1
and concerns are so great that one security source has warned : ‘ however much physical security you have , if someone is already in there , there ’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism			0
’ @entity0 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘ insiders ’ – highlighted by the @entity30 disaster			1
warning : @entity0 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in @entity5 ’s nuclear , transport and public services after co-pilot @entity8 killed 150 people in the @entity11 plane crash disaster co-pilot @entity8 , who was being treated for depression , was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground			1
guidance issued by the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , a security agency accountable to the director general of @entity0 , recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees , with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public			1
but a @entity53 pilot , who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world , claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks			1
the pilot , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ @entity53 is more interested in checking whether i have a hernia than mental health			1
‘ there is no testing regarding mental health			2
’ a @entity53 spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots			2
the @entity43 has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat , including theft , revenge , a hunger for notoriety , political or religious ideology and fear or coercion , where external pressure is exerted on a worker			0
rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the @entity30 @entity85 a @entity43 study showed that three - quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation , but whose loyalties changed after recruitment			2
disturbingly , it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue			2
some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of @entity104 whistleblower @entity103 – process corruption ( where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends ) and corporate espionage			0
the security source said : ‘ years ago , the emphasis was on external security			0
now ‘ ‘ the insider ’ ’ is the growing threat , as seen in the cases of @entity103 and @entity8			0
‘ we advise companies to look closely at their personnel			0
the higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment , the closer they should be monitored			0
