by @entity0 published : 01:45 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:47 est , 27 february 2014 the phone system at @entity10 failed during the deadly shooting in @entity12 last november - leaving police who first responded to the scene with no idea where the gunman was , it has been revealed today			1
investigators who are probing the security response to the attack , allegedly carried out by 24 - year - old @entity17 armed with an assault rifle , found a series of alarming problems with the communications systems at @entity10 that could have cost officers more than 90 critical seconds to find the shooting , two officials told the @entity0			1
phone terminals at @entity27 checkpoints did n't transmit the caller 's location to 911 dispatchers - as they were designed to do			1
when a @entity27 agent called 911 as the shooting began and then fled as the gunman drew closer , emergency operators and police were in the dark about where exactly the call has come from			1
one official likened the situation to a 911 call but police not knowing what address to go to			2
airport dispatchers knew something was wrong but did n't know where to send help because the system did n't identify locations of its emergency phones			2
failure : police who responded to initial reports of a shooting at @entity10 in november did n't know where the 911 call came from additionally , a review found that panic buttons throughout the airport - including many in @entity12 - did not work and cell phone calls to 911 were routed to the @entity60 or @entity61 instead of nearby airport police dispatchers			1
when the gunman entered the airport , a screening supervisor in the sprawling airport 's @entity12 picked up the phone but fled before responding to a dispatcher 's questions because the assailant was approaching with a high - powered rifle and spraying bullets , according to two officials briefed on preliminary findings of a review of the emergency response to the november 1 incident			1
after asking questions and receiving no answers , the dispatcher hung up			0
an airline contractor working in the terminal called dispatch directly from his cellphone , and officers were dispatched 90 seconds after the shooting			1
@entity86 , a former security director for @entity87 who owns an aviation security consulting business , said most emergency phone systems he 's seen indicate the origin of a call			2
if ' dispatch does n't know where the call is coming from , that shows there 's a serious flaw , obviously , ' said @entity86 , who has conducted security surveys at about 100 airports around the world			2
he was not involved in the review of the @entity104 airport shooting			0
officials with @entity106 , the agency that runs @entity10 , declined to comment on any aspects of the review until the report is issued next month			0
gun battle : this surveillance image shows the spot where alleged gunman @entity17 was shot and wounded by police officers the broad review of the emergency response included interviews with airport staff , law enforcement and first responders , reviews of camera footage , dispatch logs and 911 calls			1
while it found that the response was swift , the investigation conducted by airport staff and an outside contractor also identified a number of problems			0
among them : the attack killed @entity133 officer @entity132 and injured two other @entity27 officers and a passenger			1
@entity17 , 24 , who 'd moved from @entity136 , @entity137 , to @entity10 two years prior , is accused of targeting @entity27 officers			2
he has pleaded not guilty to 11 federal charges , including murder of a federal officer			0
earlier @entity0 reporting revealed that the only two armed airport police officers assigned to the area of the shooting were n't in @entity12 at the time			1
both were on breaks and had yet to notify dispatchers , as required , so neither was in position to call in the shooting			0
once dispatchers put out the call for help 90 seconds later , it took nearly two more minutes before armed officers arrived			1
@entity17 was shot and taken into custody near gate 35 , deep inside the terminal , soon afterward			0
airport police could n't get to the shooter or the victims as quickly because of the phone snafus the @entity0 also found that it took 33 minutes for @entity132 to be wheeled out of the terminal to waiting medical personnel			1
he was pronounced dead at the hospital after surgeons worked on him for an hour			0
a coroner 's news release later said he likely was dead within two to five minutes after being shot multiple times			0
in response to the shooting , the @entity171 already has announced it will train more tactical paramedics who can more quickly enter dangerous areas			0
@entity10 police are training their officers on how to use combat - style trauma kits			0
@entity27 officer @entity179 , who has worked at @entity10 for six years and is former president of the local union , said the inability of dispatchers to locate the origin of the emergency call highlights local @entity27 officers ' concerns about overall communication with airport police			1
he said no general instruction on how to use the phones has been provided			0
' a lot of these protocols that have been set up , we find , at least on the @entity27 end , it 's supervisor - driven , and the employees , the subordinates , do not necessarily know many of the protocols , ' @entity179 said			2
' if someone told me to pick up the phone , i would n't know what to say			0
' the review recommends instituting emergency protocol and evacuation training for all airport employees ' we realize in incidents like this , how quick you are or how fast you are at responding to incidents is generally going to be the difference between how many people get hurt or do n't get hurt , ' airport police chief @entity208 said in a recent interview			1
he said the airport in its review had looked at ways to speed up notification from @entity27 , dispatch and also within the airport itself			0
since the shooting , @entity208 said airport staff worked to ensure that all airport employees have the airport police dispatch number in their cellphones .			2

@entity27 agent called 911 , but had to hang up as gunman approached
police dispatcher could not tell where the call was made from and police scrambled to find the shooter
*glitch* likely cost 90 seconds in response time
one @entity27 agent was killed and two were wounded in the november 1 shooting
broken ' panic buttons ' that when hit are supposed to *automatically* call for help and activate a camera giving airport police a view of the area reporting trouble . two of the dozen or so buttons in @entity12 were n't working and several others around the airport were *defective* . later testing revealed that another terminal 's system of buttons was down and airport police beefed up patrols until it was fixed , one of the officials said . though @entity27 officers told airport officials that an officer hit the panic button , there 's no evidence - video or *electronic* - it happened .
anyone calling 911 at the airport is routed to the @entity60 or @entity61 , not airport police dispatchers .
the airport has no system allowing for *simultaneous* emergency *announcements* throughout the *complex* .
most cameras in the terminal provided fixed and often limited views of areas or were n't located at key spots such as curbs , making it *difficult* for investigators to learn how and where the gunman arrived at the airport .
