representatives of more than 20,000 pubs and bars have said they will offer wine that contain less than 12 per cent alcohol @entity23 wine is traditionally the biggest seller for most pubs and concern has grown at the increasing strength being offered in recent years			1
wines containing 14 per cent alcohol or more are no longer uncommon			1
under the new guidance a typical bottle will contain no more than 12 per cent			2
it means a glass of house wine will contain about 14 per cent less alcohol			2
however , @entity37 mp @entity36 condemned the proposal as ‘ nanny state nonsense ’			0
mr @entity36 said ministers should focus on cracking down on problem drinkers and yobs rather than interfering in the wider industry			0
‘ why should the overwhelming majority of responsible drinkers be denied the drink of their choice because of a lunatic minority ? ’ he said			0
‘ this is a sort of nanny state measure i would expect from a @entity53 government – not a @entity55 government			0
