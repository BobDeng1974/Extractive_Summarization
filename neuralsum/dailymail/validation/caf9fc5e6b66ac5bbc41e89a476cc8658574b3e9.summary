@entity0 is clamping down on @entity2 operations in the latest attack on what it perceives to be decadent @entity6 practices			2
doctors working for @entity8 have been ordered to charge 15,000 @entity10 pounds for a @entity2 childbirth operation , the equivalent of two months salary for the average @entity10 worker			1

some clerics consider the procedure too @entity6 and decadent but the high fees will force women who ca n't afford the operations to endure painful childbirth			1
a written order published in the northern @entity10 province of @entity41 states : ' in order to assist the believers from the sons of @entity45 who are working in the medical corps to support their brothers from the poor and others besides them from the @entity51 populace , and with the desire to keep the course of medical work removed from arbitrary whim			1

' i am afraid that this may be a plot against the @entity51 , because the more births take place in this manner , the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman , and she becomes unable to get pregnant			1
' he adds : ' some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a @entity2 , then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally			0
