he initially owed £ 1,350 but by the time he was killed by a train at @entity18 in february last year , the sum had risen to £ 70,000 , including legal fees			1
the court previously heard claims the council had ‘ hounded him death ’ but yesterday officials said they had ‘ spent years ’ trying to help him			2
