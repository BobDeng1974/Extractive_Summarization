exclusive by @entity1 it appears that even the @entity4 's own bodyguard are not immune from absurd health and safety rules after these @entity8 troops were pictured wearing high visibility jackets on the streets of central @entity11			1
the photograph was taken in @entity13 , close to @entity14 where the @entity8 is based , and shows around half a dozen riders wearing the safety clothing as they rode along a busy street			1
one onlooker said : ' it 's bizarre and hardly very dignified for these soldiers			0
it 's not like you can miss them anyway , they 're on massive great horses and they 're taking up a whole lane			0
' the @entity8 is made up of the two most senior regiments of the @entity29 , the @entity30 and the @entity31 and @entity32			2
the troops are garrisoned at @entity34 , close to @entity35 , and is part of the @entity37 and is the @entity4 's official bodyguard			0
' the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) also states that high visibility clothing should be worn by horse riders			2
' in addition to the advice issued , the commanding officer expects all his soldiers and officers to comply with this advice to ensure safety for both other road users and themselves			2
' @entity68 takes the safety of all its employees seriously and would expect them to take all reasonable measures to ensure they are safe and secure in whatever activity they are undertaking be it horse riding or otherwise			2
' modern times have now caught up with tradition and @entity78 personnel were ordered to wear high - vis vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the @entity84 of @entity86 airmen and to honour 50 of them who were caught and executed yesterday airmen were ordered to wear high - visibility vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the daring escape			1
the bright yellow jackets are being worn by 50 @entity78 personnel as they march from the site of the @entity98 prisoner camp to a war cemetery in western @entity100 to honour the fearless servicemen who were brutally executed during @entity102			1
a source involved with the march said : ' it is common sense			2
and there are some really bad @entity100 drivers			0
' one onlooker told @entity110 : ' it 's bonkers - they are trying to honour daring and secrecy by ticking all the health and safety boxes			1
our war heroes would be turning in their graves			0
' in four days , the @entity118 airmen are to walk more than 100 miles to the @entity118 war cemetery in @entity120 , where the ashes of those executed were buried after the war			1
the bright yellow jackets are being worn by 50 @entity78 airmen as they march from the site of the @entity98 prisoner camp to a war cemetery in western @entity100 one onlooker said : ' it 's bonkers - they are trying to honour daring and secrecy by ticking all the health and safety boxes			1
our war heros would be turning in their graves ' one of a group of some 50 members of the @entity78 , carrying a picture of an executed @entity118 airman @entity138 , director of the @entity139 near @entity140 , said the @entity118 group started in pouring rain from a monument marking the place where 76 prisoners of war emerged			1
during observances this week , they have met two @entity118 former @entity150 inmates , retired @entity78 airmen @entity151 and @entity153 , who were held at the camp after the time of the @entity84			1
the plot became the inspiration behind the classic war film @entity102 starring @entity160 legend @entity159			0
a group of about 250 prisoners , started to digging tunnels , in which they were going to escape the 59 - acre site , which had five miles of perimeter fencing			2
time for a change ? a mock - up of what the @entity169 would look like if they decided to wear a high - vis jacket over their red uniform if the concept of wearing a high - vis jacket was deployed across all units it could look like this			1
left , a patrol searching for ieds and @entity183 fighters and right , the @entity185 at @entity35 left : a mock - up of what prince @entity187 would have looked like if he had been made to wear a high - vis vest during his time in @entity190 and left , how @entity159 would have looked in @entity102 if he too had fallen victim to the health and safety zealots more than 600 prisoners were involved in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed @entity198 - at the camp in the @entity201 @entity200 , 100 miles southeast of @entity202			1
@entity198 and @entity203 had to be abandoned with @entity187 becoming the focus of their escape route			0
it was approximately 300ft long and 28ft deep			0
only 200 of the higher ranking captives , those who could speak @entity201 and had put a lot of work into digging the tunnels , would have time to escape in the plan			0
but there was a series of problems on the night of the escape			0
the main issue was that the @entity219 came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower			0
the plan : 250 officers spent 11 months building @entity187 , a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in @entity140 , @entity100 the site 100 miles south of @entity202 was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during @entity229 this is a shot of the entrance of the @entity232 which captured the hearts of the world when it emerged a commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea as the 77th man exited the tunnel , they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of the escaped prisoners were captured			0
fifty of those were shot			0
an @entity78 spokesman said : ' there are 50 current serving @entity78 personnel currently walking towards @entity120 , which is the final resting place for @entity254 @entity253 , who was the mastermind for the @entity84 ; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads , which are not closed to traffic , they are wearing hi - vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely			1
