by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson last august @entity1 was in @entity2 on international duty , dodging @entity5 journalists on his way to meet up with his @entity8 team - mates , and still uncertain of his £ 86million transfer to @entity10			1
one year on , he will be back in @entity2 to play in the @entity11 against @entity12 and he will do so with 22 goals , the @entity14 and the @entity15			1
it ’s hard to recall a record signing who has had a greater impact in his first year			1
@entity1 is only the third player in @entity10 ’s history to score in the final of both the @entity15 and the @entity14 in the same season			1
only @entity23 and @entity24 have done it before			1
legend : @entity1 was instrumental in landing @entity10 their much - wanted tenth @entity15 @entity27 : the @entity28 was full of supporters as the club paraded their newly won trophy through @entity10 sept 1 , 2013 : signs for @entity10 for a world record £ 86million			1
sept 14 : scores on debut in 2 - 2 draw against @entity36			2
oct 30 : scores two in 7 - 3 victory against @entity12			0
dubbed @entity38 — little cannon — by local media			0
nov 30 : a perfect hat - trick — header and goal with each foot — in 4 - 0 win over @entity46			0
april 16 , 2014 : brilliant solo effort in victory over @entity49 in @entity14 final is his 20th of the season			1
may 24 : his goal sets up @entity10 ’s 10th @entity15 triumph			2
no wonder @entity5 sports daily @entity56 claimed : ‘ he has turned out to be a bargain ; he is already a @entity10 legend ’ and @entity61 added : ‘ @entity1 ’s was the winner ; it was game over after that			2
’ @entity1 has already outdone all previous @entity65 abroad			1
@entity66 played in the @entity68 final that @entity10 lost to @entity69 and @entity70 was a goalscoring , man - of - the - match , winner in 2000 when @entity10 beat @entity74 3 - 0			2
@entity75 managed just one @entity15 quarter - final appearance in his four years at @entity10			2
@entity77 and @entity78 both won @entity79 with foreign clubs and @entity81 won @entity82 at @entity83 but never the @entity15 with them			2
@entity1 has often also outshone the man he came to aid and abet last summer , @entity85			1
he has delivered more than the @entity86 in the finals , although he was at pains to point out both halves of the dynamic duo have taken @entity10 to glory this season			0
big moment : this header earned @entity1 infamy in @entity10 's long history inside the @entity97 with his medal around his neck , before the players were whisked back to @entity102 airport for their 6am date at @entity10 ’s @entity103 , he said : ‘ we work well together and we enjoy playing alongside each other			2
whoever scores we are all happy as long as we are winning			0
’ the 24 - year - old ’s favourite post-match phrase is ‘ it ’s a dream come true ’ and when he was a teenage fan of the @entity5 side he will have imagined such heroics as only a wide - eyed wannabe can			0
‘ the reason i joined @entity10 was to play in these amazing matches			0
it ’s hard to describe how i felt when the ball went in			0
it was an incredible feeling seeing all the fans behind that goal and all the players run towards me to celebrate			0
’ upstaged : @entity1 outshone the best player in the world , @entity85 even @entity122 had joined in as the player he pushed the club to sign last summer delivered one of the most famous goals in their history			1
‘ when we got the equaliser it seemed that we had the momentum going into extra time			0
we looked fresher than them			0
they had a few players who had cramp and we showed what physical condition we were in , ’ said @entity1			0
stories about @entity1 needing an operation this summer to cure a hernia were rubbished by his agent and there looked very little wrong as he leapt to head home after @entity146 had only managed to deflect a shot from @entity148			0
best ever : @entity1 has now proven himself as @entity150 's best ever footballing export there had been tension earlier in the season , with the @entity154 unhappy at being usurped by the new signing from @entity156 , especially as he was playing well			1
but problem solver @entity157 made room for both and @entity1 ’s team - mates have been completely won over by the shy boy from @entity2 , who will be going home this august having established himself as @entity150 ’s best ever footballing export .			1

a year after his £ 86m transfer , it 's hard to recall a signing who has had a greater impact in his debut season
@entity1 is only the third player to score in the final of both the @entity15 and the @entity14 in the same season - the others are @entity23 and @entity24
@entity177 has already done all previous brits to play abroad
the boy from @entity2 outshone @entity85 on the biggest stage
