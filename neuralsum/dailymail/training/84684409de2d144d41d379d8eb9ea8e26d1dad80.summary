by @entity0 last updated at 9:43 am on 20th december 2011 @entity1 is the most popular ' online world ' ever created - playing host to 10 million gamers who battle its dragons , demons and dungeons , or just fight and trade with each other			1
it 's also a money machine that generates a reported $ 500 million a year in subscriptions and disc sales - making its owner @entity16 the biggest games company on @entity17			1
but tomorrow , gaming giant @entity18 unveils one of the most expensive games ever made - @entity21			1
the game aims to outpace @entity24 's swords and sorcery with interstellar travel , lightsabers and the world of @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31			2
if it succeeds , it could push @entity18 ahead of its bitter rival @entity16			2
players can opt to play as lightsaber - wielding @entity35 or evil sith - you ca n't play as famous characters such as @entity30 , but a few famous faces crop up throughout the game ' @entity42 ' games such as @entity21 allow tens of thousands of players to adventure together - battling monsters together or battling one another to become more powerful many games have attempted the feat - including several with well - known characters such as @entity47 - but the @entity21 is hotly tipped to do it , thanks to the familiar @entity50 , a rumoured Â£ 100 - million - plus budget , and the fact that @entity24 subscribers seem to be tiring of the game 's fantasy world , with two million leaving in the past year			1
the game officially launches tomorrow			0
early buyers have been able to access the game since december 13 , but tomorrow sees the floodgates open			0
for gamers , it 's easily the biggest launch in a genre that 's been ruled single - handedly by @entity24 for more than five years			0
it 's finally happening , ' said game site @entity66 this week			0
the game 's maker , @entity18 , was once the biggest game publisher in the world , but lost ground to rival @entity16 when @entity16 acquired @entity73 , makers of @entity1 in 2008			1
the early signs are all good - no reviews are published yet , as @entity18 has been keen to manage publicity , but 1.6 million users played an early ' test ' version of the game unlike @entity24 , @entity21 uses recorded voice dialogue , rather than text - it has a more voice acting than any previous game , online or off the game has seen the previous star wars online ' world ' - star wars : galaxies - switched off yesterday , with an announcement that the @entity90 had ' won '			1
but while previews and gamer reaction to the game is generally good , others are less sure about the business model			0
the game has been astronomically expensive for @entity18 , and faces competition from other , free , online games			2
the evil @entity31 holds court in the highly anticipated @entity101 title @entity21			2
gamers will play ' together ' in an online world based on @entity21 @entity104 , president of @entity18 , said to @entity105 , ' i wish it was n't so expensive			1
' the business model where gamers pay for discs , then pay to subscribe , is also under threat			0
many games , such as @entity115 's @entity114 , have switched to a ' free to play ' system similar to @entity118 games , where the game itself is free , but users pay to upgrade their character with powerful items or new outfits			0
gaming site @entity125 described the game as ' the end of an era ' - saying that it 's arrived as the world of online gaming changes forever			2
the game lets players battle monsters - or one another , with the players split into two factions			2
the resulting mix ensures that both pacifists and more warlike players are catered for school for scoundrels : the @entity143 , where players can be trained in using the powers of the @entity145			0
you can also join the @entity35 - or simply become a trader the @entity21 does have new ideas , though such as voice acting throughout the game - giving @entity150 a more story - driven feel			1
it 's also driven the price up hugely			0
@entity1 has had up to 12 million monthly subscribers , earning the company a reported $ 500 million a year in subscription fees - on top of disc prices for the game and its four expansions			1
the game has been running since 2004			0
gamers will team up together to take on hideous alien beasts in a huge ' online world ' shared by millions the game includes hundreds of planets to explore - gamers can captain spaceships , command crews , make millions , and even turn to the @entity145 the game also has voice acting throughout - and a greater focus on story than @entity24 , which gamers sometimes complain has ' hamster wheel ' - like qualities , as they 're forced to repeat tasks to earn in - game rewards			1
the world of @entity150 is far bigger than the world of the films - but gamers should expect to meet familiar faces			0

@entity21 is most expensive game ever by @entity18
more voice acting than any previous game
arrives as @entity1 ' leaks ' two million subscribers
*warcraft* earns $ 500 million a year from subscriptions - @entity21 ' could earn billions '
