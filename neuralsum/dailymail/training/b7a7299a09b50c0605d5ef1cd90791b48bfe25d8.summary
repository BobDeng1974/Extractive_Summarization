however @entity4 's lawyers , brothers @entity16 and @entity18 , said after their client 's first court appearance on monday that they do n't believe the case involved road rage			1

@entity13 police say @entity4 bragged to his friends several hours after the shooting that he ' got those kids , they were after me , and i got them '			1
