by @entity0 @entity1 has shown little to suggest he is the man to manage @entity2			1
little to indicate he might be the new @entity3			2
three years at modest @entity5 second flight club @entity4 ended tamely with a mutual parting of the ways			2
at @entity11 , his latest gig , the first ten games of the season have brought three wins , two draws and five defeats			0
currently 11th in a league of 16 teams this is a team battling for survival , not trophies			0
in with a shout : @entity1 could be the next @entity2 boss but lacks coaching experience legend : @entity1 enjoyed a seven - year career at @entity2 and won the league title four times time to move on : @entity25 left @entity2 earlier in the week @entity1 , then , has no real coaching record to speak of			1
nothing which screams he is the man to lead @entity2 to the last 16 of the @entity28			1
but the appeal to @entity30 and the @entity2 board is obvious			1
@entity1 is box office , a marquee name			1
he wants the job desperately			0
bluntly , he would put bums on seats			1
how many of the names on a lengthy list of runners and riders would immediately do that ? @entity42 and @entity43 probably would n’t			0
@entity44 is a sound , solid candidate - a lifelong @entity2 fan with just one blip on his cv from @entity50 and a less than sparkling spell at @entity52			1
but if @entity44 is appointed the @entity54 champions wo n’t be selling season tickets			0
they will be pulping them			0
temptation : @entity2 majority shareholder @entity30 knows the appeal of hiring @entity1 to replace @entity25 from the perspective of a board of directors wrestling with growing apathy and boredom in the stands , then , @entity1 holds obvious appeal			1
@entity2 need an adrenalin shot			1
someone to rally the fans and stimulate interest			2
that @entity1 would be a commercial rather than football decision is beyond dispute			1
people have also described it as an instance of the heart ruling the head			0
but that ’s not quite right			0
because what can be more calculating or planned than choosing a manager more suited to selling season tickets than winning trophies ? it ’s possible , of course , that @entity1 could be an outstanding success on both fronts			1
@entity86 was his first gig			0
travelling to meet the great man in the @entity5 outpost in april 2010 the pitch was brown and bare , the stands the type you ’d find at a municipal athletics stadium			0
money was scarce and , for a man who played for three of @entity97 ’s biggest clubs , @entity2 offer a far more appealing canvas to paint on			1
with the current squad of players , @entity1 is just as likely to win the @entity101 by 20 points as a @entity43 or a @entity103			1
but the problem is this			0
if @entity2 ’s only priority is selling tickets they could appoint @entity108			1
what they actually need is the best man to take them back to the @entity28			1
that ’s where the real money is to be found			2
that ’s what sustains this club now			0
it ’s how they define themselves			0
and whoever they appoint as the next manager has to be able to deliver			2
@entity25 showed that an inexperienced manager can do it			1
but only after a nine - game trial			0
this time around @entity2 do n’t have that luxury			1
baptism of fire : @entity25 was inexperienced as a manager when he took over at @entity2 like the @entity132 , @entity1 knows plenty about life at @entity135			1
he spent seven years at the club scoring 242 goals in 315 appearances			0
he has been fully briefed on why @entity25 left and , despite telling his current club he will stay put , wants the job			1
it could be argued that @entity2 ’s @entity28 qualification hopes would be better with @entity1 in the dug - out and 60,000 in the top deck than they would be with @entity44 in there and a crowd of 42,000			1
the @entity2 board are entitled to go for someone who will invigorate the place			2
someone who will stir the senses			0
but it ’s not @entity1 , the iconic player , they would be getting			2
it ’s larsson the manager			2
and he no longer scores goals			0
in private @entity1 can be a warm and funny man			2
far more so than his public image suggests			0
but there are aspects of managing @entity2 which would grate hugely			1
goal machine : @entity1 scored 242 times for @entity2 during his career at the club the incessant media demands			1
the inevitable intrusion into his private life			0
even signing autographs – a practice he was prone to avoiding as a player by having his car moved to a sidedoor			0
like @entity25 he has a strong , determined mind of his own			2
he ’s not the type to be controlled or told who he is signing			0
he might buy into @entity2 ’s ‘ model ’ of buying young players and selling big 100 per cent			2
he would have to be			0
but there is an unmistakable irony here and it ’s this			0
had @entity1 been a @entity2 player now he would have hung around one , maybe two seasons , then he would have been sold			1
he would never have become the @entity183 of yore			0
this is what a @entity2 manager must deal with these days while delivering @entity28 football			1
is @entity1 up to it ? right now there is n’t a scrap of evidence to suggest that he is .			2

former @entity2 legend @entity1 is *favourite* to take over from @entity25 as manager
would be a *popular* appointment with fans and put bums on seats
however , @entity1 has no real coaching *pedigree* and a lack of experience of managing in the @entity28
