imagine , for a moment , the pressure @entity1 found himself under			1
to one side , his new manager @entity2 was watching intently			1
around him , meanwhile , were seasoned trophy - winning professionals headed by @entity6 , who wondered if he would deliver			1
this , for the 20 - year - old , was a completely new situation			2
but it was not on the pitch in front of 75,000 expectant fans at @entity16 , @entity1 ’s first big @entity11 examination came 38,000 feet above the @entity17			1
‘ we had to get up , one by one and sing it over the speaker of the plane			2
i did a song by @entity32 [ an @entity34 rapper ] , called @entity35			1
‘ it was quite fitting really , as we were on our way back [ from @entity38 after beating @entity39 in the @entity40 ]			1
@entity41 went first and he did a speech , answering questions from all the senior players			2
@entity45 and @entity6 were behind it			1
it was all in good spirits			2
’ if the defender passed that light - hearted examination , an altogether more serious one was presented to him on the opening day of the new @entity53 campaign , when @entity54 handed him his senior debut against @entity56			1
chance : @entity1 has played in all three of @entity11 's @entity53 games @entity1 responded in the 2 - 1 defeat with a display of some promise and he has now played in each of @entity11 ’s three @entity53 games			1
another first is around the corner as he is expected to win his first @entity21 cap when @entity66 ’s side play their final @entity68 qualifier in @entity22 on tuesday			1
for some , the new - found scrutiny and profile would be difficult to handle but @entity1 , a lifelong @entity11 fan who has been with the club since he was seven , is studious and grounded			1
he epitomises the type of character that @entity66 wants			0
‘ you have to be disciplined with it and be able to criticise yourself , ’ he says during his first interview with a national newspaper			0
‘ it ’s not an easy thing to do and can be quite difficult , especially if you are going to watch a game where you know you have not played your best			0
but i feel it is something you have to do if you want to improve			0
it is especially helpful when you are trying to learn how to play a new system [ playing three at the back ] like we are at @entity11 now			1
‘ we all watch and analyse performances together after matches			0
you have to study performances on your own too			0
i ’ve not only done that at @entity11			1
i did it when i was on loan at @entity93 and @entity94 [ last season ] as well			0
i get the broadcasts of my games from the media guys at the club			0
i take them home and watch them on my laptop			0
‘ watching the games lets me know where i need to improve			0
i was watching one game at @entity103 recently when @entity104 walked past			0
he stopped , shook my hand , said “ well done ” and left me to it			0
’ sing song : @entity1 performed @entity32 's @entity35 challenge : @entity1 had to perform in front of @entity11 's senior players like @entity6 @entity104 is not the only former @entity11 great charting his progress			1
@entity113 , now with @entity114 , would take @entity1 to one side to offer pointers , while the confidence @entity54 has given him is clear to see			2
‘ i still speak with @entity118 now and he texts me after games , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ he would take me for training sessions on my own where he would give me tips			0
‘ as for the manager , he said from day one that he was always going to help our cause and give young players a chance			2
it gave all the young players at the club a lift			0

@entity1 had to perform in front of new manager @entity2 and senior pros like @entity6
the @entity11 defender performed @entity32 's @entity35 on return *flight* from @entity38
@entity1 is expected to win his first @entity21 cap against @entity22 on tuesday
