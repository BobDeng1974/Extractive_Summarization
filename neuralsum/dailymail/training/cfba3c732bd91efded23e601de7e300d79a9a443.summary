by @entity0 i cruised through my 20s with a lean physique and - at the very least - a four - pack			1
but a combination of age , a busy work schedule , a lack of exercise and a new - found love of cheesecake left me staring at 30 with blossoming love handles and an unseemly gut			2
to make matters worse , my wedding was fast approaching , and the last thing i wanted to do was to let my fiancee down by looking like a slob in front of all our friends and family			2
i was desperate to turn things around , get back in shape and look my best for our big day			2
trainer @entity26 , director of @entity27 , was there to offer a solution - but it would n’t be easy			2
here , he is pictured ( @entity36 ) at weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 for starters , i always thought my diet was pretty clean - i was wrong			1
for the first two weeks , @entity26 put me on a high - protein , no - carb diet consisting of a kilo of meat and fish a day , with only green veg , nuts and water to accompany it			1
this involved planning my food shops and batch - cooking my meals with military precision , and it was n’t cheap			2
but once i got used to the idea of food being purely a fuel source , i settled into a manageable - if boring - routine			0
after the initial no - carb shock , @entity26 began reintroducing them to help me build muscle , allowing binge days of ‘ clean ’ carbs on the weekends			0
formerly plain - seeming foods such as brown rice suddenly became the highlight of my culinary week			0
before and after : @entity0 was desperate to get back in shape and look his best for his wedding day			1
trainer @entity26 , director of @entity27 , was there to offer a solution it was n't easy ! by tinkering with the workouts and adding brutal upgrades - such as wearing a 20kg chain around his neck during farmer 's walks to strengthen his upper back - @entity26 forced @entity0 's muscles to grow the big day : @entity0 's fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results meanwhile , i was making progress in the gym			1
after two weeks of full - body conditioning workouts - designed to improve technique and kick - start my metabolism - i moved on to three - way body part splits , training chest , back and triceps in one session , then shoulders , biceps and legs in another			1
the workouts combined big compound moves such as the deadlift and bench press with strongman exercises such as sled drags and @entity98 presses , finishing off with isolation moves including curls and flyes ( when you lie on a bench use the pectoral and deltoid muscles to lift the weights inwards )			0
by tinkering with the workouts and adding brutal upgrades - such as wearing a 20kg chain around my neck during farmer ’s walks to strengthen my upper back - @entity26 forced my muscles to grow			0
by the end of the eight weeks , my body fat had plummeted from 18.5 per cent to 7.1 per cent , while my abs and obliques were completely shredded , holding just 6mm and 6.2mm of fat			1
building muscle : @entity0 ; s workouts combined big compound moves such as the deadlift and bench press with strongman exercises such as sled drags and @entity98 presses , finishing off with isolation moves including curls and flyes i ’d put on upper - body muscle too , as well as improving my posture by counteracting an imbalance around my scapula that had been giving me grief for years			1
what ’s more , the diet had worked wonders for my digestive system and reminded me of how much fun weekends are without a crushing hangover			0
my fiance - who had been amazingly supportive throughout - was thrilled with the results			0
i had n’t looked even remotely this good since the early days of our relationship , and while she was n’t a fan of the obligatory photoshoot chest wax , my newly rediscovered abs more than made up for it			0
the only unexpected drawback was that none of my clothes fitted anymore , but thankfully i ’d been planning to go suit shopping at the last minute anyway due to my best man being out of the country			0
when my wedding day finally arrived i looked and felt better than i had at any point in my entire adult life			0
and if i can do it , there ’s no reason why you ca n’t too			0
