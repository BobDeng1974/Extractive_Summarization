by @entity0 for @entity1 the happy couple - husband , @entity2 or @entity3 to the casual eye , the two brides pictured in this photograph appear to be tying the knot as part of a modern same - sex marriage			1
in fact , they are a heterosexual couple from @entity14 - where gay and lesbian weddings are strictly forbidden			1
but that did not stop the groom , @entity2 , 23 , dressing as a woman for the ceremony - which took place in @entity22			1
@entity2 , who prefers to be called @entity3 , describes himself as ' androgyne ' , someone who is unable fit neatly into either gender role			1
and he claims to feel more comfortable as a woman , despite still being attracted to females			2
his bride 's real identity is not known , though her first name is @entity32 , 19 , and she is better known in @entity22 by her nickname , @entity5			1
the couple married despite official disapproval and outrage from a registry office horrified at the prospect of both bride and groom turning up in dresses			1
@entity3 said : ' in may , we filled in the application in the registry office , and our appearance did not cause any questions at all , which surprised us			1
' ' but just a couple of weeks before the wedding they started to call us			0
when they could not reach us , they called my mother			2
' the registry office was concerned that both would arrive in white bridal dresses , as , indeed , they did			1
@entity2 , also called @entity3 , in wedding dress ( left ) before marrying wife @entity5 ( right ) @entity3 added : ' the head of the registry office asked her to instruct us that we should not appear both in dresses , because in @entity14 marriage is between a man and a woman , and no other way			1
' she threatened that she would not allow us to come in such clothes			0
' when i called her , she threatened me with an administrative punishment , saying something about the insult to the feelings of believers , and so on - although we did not marry in church			1
' eventually the registry office ' surrendered ' since , in fact , there are no rules on couples marrying when both are wearing white bridal dresses			1
@entity3 claims that other registry offices were ready to welcome them ' with open arms ' because they liked the idea of the publicity			1
the proud couple show off their wedding rings ( left ) and @entity3 carries his bride , @entity32 ( right ) @entity32 said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner @entity3 ( above ) was androgyne he added : ' but we arrived at the appointed place at the appointed hour			1
' the head of the office hurried into the room where we had to sign documents			2
next , she told us insulting things that we shame the concept of family and we need to be treated			0
' @entity32 rightly explained to this woman that she looked no better than us			2
' finally , they let in the guests , and a film crew , and they declared us husband and wife , and we exchanged rings			0
' all the staff of the registry office , the couples waiting to marry , and people on the street gave us amused glances			1
' @entity2 , or @entity3 , believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in @entity14 , where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions he now believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in @entity14 , where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions , and where there can be hostility to non-conventional couples			1
he added : ' i believe that we have created an important precedent for such a wedding in @entity14 , for we are not alone in having such problems			1
' i have written to couples who are planning similar marriages and are afraid of failures with registration			0
be aware - you can not be refused			2
' @entity32 insists the couple are deeply in love and want to have ' not one child but at least two '			2
she said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner was androgyne			0
she said : ' i came up to her and said she is very beautiful			0
' asked how she would explain to her children that their parents were both ' female ' , she replied : ' why do we need to explain ? it 's how it is			2
' @entity32 ( left ) said she is deeply in love with androgyne @entity2 ( right ) previously , @entity2 - or @entity3 - has explained : ' i 'm a guy with a normal orientation and , accordingly , i like women 's beauty			1
and it should be clear my desire , to some extent , is to conform to my ideal			0
' after all , girls are the fairer sex			0
so if a guy looks like a girl - it 's wonderful			2
' this means that at least he is a cute guy			0
my idea is that a man should be just as sweet and beautiful as a woman			2
after all , it 's terrible when beautiful , slim , gentle girl is with a rough bearded man			0
' i am for the beauty for all of us			0
girls nowadays are often more beautiful than men , although initially boys as well as girls have an attractive appearance , but guys do not pay attention to their beauty			0
girls , for example , learn something from men , develop activities that had previously been a purely male and they are clever			0
' guys can also learn a few things from girls , such as beauty and grooming , empathy , emotional warmth			0
' and it has nothing to do with being homosexual			0
ideally , the person will be combined with both male and female features			0
and this is the highest level of personal development			0

@entity2 , 23 , - also called @entity3 - prefers to dress as woman
married @entity5 , 19 , in white gown despite registry office outrage
officially pair were not breaking @entity14 anti gay and lesbian laws with union
say they are ' deeply in love ' and want ' at least two children ' together
