@entity1 manager @entity0 is not bothered by how @entity2 will react to their slump , only that his own players produce the goods at the @entity6 on sunday			1
a terrible run of form has seen @entity2 slip down into fourth place , their 4 - 2 loss to rivals @entity11 leaving @entity13 's side well adrift of leaders @entity14 and now in a battle to stay ahead of @entity17 in the race for @entity20 qualification			1
however , @entity1 are also in need of some consistency , with a stoppage - time goal conceded at home to @entity25 denying them what would have been only a third league win of 2015			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 will hope for a strong end to the season , but it has threatened to tail off @entity0 reacts on the touchline during the @entity1 ' match with @entity25 at @entity35 last weekend ' i am more concerned about getting the best out of my team , ' said @entity0 , whose side are now in 10th place , having once looked set for a @entity42 qualification challenge themselves			1
' maybe @entity2 are a wounded animal and they might come out all guns blazing or they might be tentative			2
we wo n't know until the match starts			0
' we are expecting them to put in a determined performance in front of their own fans			1
' @entity0 added : ' the motivation for our players should be that they have let themselves down by not achieving the results that they should have done from the positions we have been in			2
' we want to get the feel - good factor back by winning a few games and getting the confidence back up			0
' @entity0 believes the @entity61 can yet go on to secure their best finish since winning promotion back to the top flight			0
' at the moment we want to reach the 50 - point mark or higher , that will make sure we finish higher than we have done in the three years we have been back , ' he said			0
@entity68 ( left ) is expected to return at the @entity6 , but a thigh strain has ruled out @entity70 @entity1 will be without @entity71 forward @entity70 because of a thigh strain , but @entity68 has recovered from a foot problem and so will lead the front line alongside veteran striker @entity76			1
@entity0 said : ' those two guys have to perform to the very best and find the goals we need to try to win the game			2
' playing at our top level is our aim on sunday			0
whether that gets us the result or not we will have to wait and see based on the quality of the opposition we are against , because when you play @entity2 all of your players have to be on top form in all areas			0
' if our lads have their shooting boots on , which we need , then you never know			0
