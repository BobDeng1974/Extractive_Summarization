@entity2 's vast @entity1 rocket , which will launch payloads of upto 130 tonnes into orbit and could make its first flight in 2017			1
it is set to become the largest rocket ever built , dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to @entity12			1
@entity2 today reveal stunning new pictures of its @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , which will eventually be capable of lifting 130 tonnes into orbit			1
the rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the @entity16 , and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system			2
it is even hoped the craft could play a role in manned missions to @entity12 , being able to launch ' stepping stone ' bases into orbit			1
' the potential use of @entity1 for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration , ' said @entity31 , astronaut and associate administrator for science at @entity34 in @entity35			0
' @entity1 has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos			2
' currently under construction , @entity34 ’s @entity1 will be the world ’s most powerful launch vehicle			1
designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations , including an asteroid and @entity12 , @entity1 is working toward a first launch in 2017			1
for that first flight test , the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons ( 77 tons ) of payload into low - @entity53 orbit , almost three times what the space shuttle could carry			1
from there , @entity1 will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry			1
' while many people think of the space launch system in terms of human exploration , @entity1 could have a wide application in a lot of other areas , including space science , ” said @entity69 , assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for @entity1			1
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity73 rockets than launched man to the @entity75			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity79 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity79 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway @entity2 's previous rockets , the @entity73 , @entity83 and right , the smaller configuration of the new @entity1 there will be two versions of the rocket			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity1 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			0
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
' for missions to the outer planets , for example , @entity1 could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible , such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times			2
' agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft , such as the @entity112 , a proposed mission to one of @entity116 's icy moons , on the @entity1 rocket , and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system ’s outer planets , rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed , reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles			1
in the case of the @entity112 , for example , the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles			0
' for as long as people have been launching rockets into space , mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width , ” @entity69 said			0
' depending on how large you make it , it can only go so fast , which in some cases limits where you can go			0
' today , if you want to send a mission to the outer planets , you have to be able to make it fit within that box			0
with @entity1 , we ’re about to make that box much larger			2
an artist 's impression of the giant rocket taking off an artist 's impression of the vast hanger needed to set the rocket up for flight ' with the space shuttle , for example , we were able to launch missions like @entity34 ’s @entity165 that were about the size of a school bus			1
' with @entity1 , you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried @entity165			2
' it ’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions			0
' ' the space launch system could be really game - changing for space science , ” said @entity178 manager @entity177			2
' for some missions , it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out			0
' a @entity12 sample return mission , for example , could be flown using only one rocket instead of three			2
' but for other destinations , @entity1 lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of @entity73 ’s moon @entity192			0
' the top section of the rocket the pieces that make up @entity2 's mega-rocket in its first configuration			0

construction of the @entity1 system has already begun
rocket will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds
first test flight *scheduled* for 2017
will be able to carry 130 tonnes into space
expected to be used to launch far larger *interplanetary* probes
could be used as part of manned @entity12 missions
