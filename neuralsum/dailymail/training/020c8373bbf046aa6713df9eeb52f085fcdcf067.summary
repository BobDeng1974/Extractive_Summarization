by @entity0 a pregnant police officer from @entity2 , @entity3 , has been told she has to stay on patrol during her pregnancy - or take unpaid leave and lose her health benefits			1
@entity8 , who became a @entity2 police officer in 2012 , last year gave birth to a daughter and was given office work so she could cope with the phyiscal strains			1
however , for this pregnancy the department says they are unable to move her position because of a change in the rules so she 'll have to stay on patrol or take the time as unpaid leave if @entity8 stays on unpaid leave , by the time she gives birth to her son she will no longer have medical insurance which is a problem because her son suffers from a rare bone disorder , reports @entity30			1
once that time was all used up , i would need to go on unpaid leave , ' said @entity8			1
' the time i had saved would be about six weeks i think and from the time i needed to come off the road i would n't have made it even close to my delivery so i would n't have health insurance by the time i delivered so that was really scary , ' she continued			2
@entity8 , who has a master ’s degree in criminal justice , says she is doing her best to work while pregnant but says the weight of the gun is pulling at her stomach and her bullet proof vest no longer fit			1
the young mom has now filed a complaint against the city of @entity2 alleging discrimination			0
“ i worked very hard to get to this point			0
this is the career i ’ve really wanted			0
i just want to get back to work , ” she told today			0
forced to choose : @entity8 does n't want to have to choose between being a mother and having a paycheck ' no one should have to choose between their health and having a family and their paycheck , ' said @entity81 , staff attorney for the advocacy group @entity82			2
the city 's attorney @entity83 issued a statement outlining their side of the story saying , ' the city has reviewed the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) complaint filed by officer @entity8			1
the city does not agree with the allegations of the complaint , but respects the rights of the officer to bring this proceeding before the @entity91			0
the city will follow the process in that form and present its defence			0
' ' i do n't think the department would have handled it this way			0
i think they were just given a policy from the city and i do n't think my department had any choice , ' said @entity8			2
@entity8 does not blame the @entity2 police department and enjoys working as a member of their team			1
' i just want to work and earn a pay check so i can take care of the daughter i already have and keep my health benefits , ' said @entity8 .			0
