i do n't know how it happened , but suddenly my daughter @entity2 is about to turn 18			2
i wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest			1
we 've always lived in @entity6 , but @entity2 has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale			1
we decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat			2
skimming the internet , i found a site called @entity14 , offering a five - day sea kayaking trip in the middle of august in northern @entity17 , @entity18			1
fins could n't be better for @entity20 in her kayak in the @entity22 in @entity18 we would kayak to base camp on the @entity22 and from there take daily excursions , paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of july and august			1
the website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months			1
the weekend before our departure , a kit list arrived by email			0
it was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers , hot water , electrical power or wi - fi during our time in the wilderness			1
we were told to bring fast - drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials			1
@entity2 insisted on bringing her camera equipment , which turned out to be a wise choice			0
we flew to @entity47 , took a small aircraft to @entity49 , and then drove to @entity50			0
even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting			0
@entity2 , who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions , could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion			0
we laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags , which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak			0
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off our group also included a couple , a single man , @entity72 , and two excellent guides , @entity74 and @entity75			1
we set off from @entity50 after a briefing on safety , security and weather conditions			0
on that first day , we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad , eggs , ham , cheese and fruit - prepared by @entity74 and @entity75			1
afterwards , as we headed back towards camp , we found ourselves right in the path of a pod			1
they were moving quickly towards us , occasionally with their fins above the water and ' blowing ' through their noses			1
watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking			1
the guide had asked us to ' raft ' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them			1
they submerged about 300ft in front of us , and i hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us			0
i could have reached out and touched them			0
from that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the @entity22			1
the animal kingdom was around us at all times : sea lions , humpback whales , bald eagles , jellyfish , dolphins , porpoises			1
kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the @entity22 this was their world , not ours			1
our base camp was beautiful , our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach			1
our bathroom , meanwhile , was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods			0
we quickly fell asleep on our first night , but i awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth			0
a few minutes later i realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent			0
@entity74 and @entity75 laughed at me , and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in @entity142			0
@entity2 and i spent five extraordinary days in the @entity22			1
the water was calm and the sun shone brightly			2
we tracked pods every day			1
at times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp			1
in the morning the whales would gun down the @entity22 as if they were on the school run , then at dusk they would drift back slowly , as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day			1
we soon learned something of their habits			0
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off			1
@entity20 and her group at the water 's edge at @entity50 near @entity49 our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt , let alone killed , by a whale in the @entity22			1
@entity74 had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do			0
it was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing , especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity			0
the local whale - watching boats know the pods well			1
each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds			1
every day was more beautiful than the last			2
we became calm and relaxed among the whales , waiting for them to reappear , then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs			0
we grew accustomed to the quiet , and it was a relief to be far away from home , with no access to emails or phones			0
on our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart - shaped by the lap of the waves			2
i asked @entity2 if she had ever been in a situation where there was no @entity215 , no connectivity , and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet			2
she said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences , she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter			0
on the final night i was desperate for a shower			0
without one , i opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea			1
it crossed my mind that i was swimming in @entity232 's pool			2
@entity20 and @entity2 came face to face with a black bear during their trip the next morning i walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time			2
that 's when i spotted a big black bear right in front of me , grunting through his huge nostrils			2
as soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth			0
i stood still , then shouted to @entity2 that she should come outside with her camera			0
the bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out - offocus photograph			2
an adventure like this was made much more special for me because i shared it with my daughter			0
travelling can be stressful , but we were almost always in good spirits , and in harmony with one another			0
we have memories that will never leave us			2
to have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something i shall treasure for ever			0
i know she enjoyed every second of it too			0
