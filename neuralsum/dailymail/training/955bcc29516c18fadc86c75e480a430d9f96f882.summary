she asked for a divorce on christmas day last year after @entity3 held his nerve to win £ 50,000 on @entity12 , he was determined that his estranged wife should not get a penny			1
but with only four months before the tv gameshow was screened and she found out about his windfall , the father - of - two knew he had to spend it fast			0
the 33 - year - old sign manufacturer and fitter said he used £ 15,000 to clear all the debts he and his wife @entity22 , 29 , had from credit card bills , loans and bank overdrafts			1
after setting aside almost £ 2,000 to cover legal fees for his divorce , he bought clothing , toys and household items for their two young children			1
mr @entity3 also used some cash to ‘ live off ’ , having being signed off from work because of ‘ depression ’			2
but he admits he spent most of the rest on ‘ having a good time ’ , including an @entity38 , a holiday in @entity40 and the outlay of £ 4,000 on a second - hand x-type @entity44 estate car			1
the final part of his winnings went days before his own august 21 deadline to pay for an electrician ’s course , so he could start a new career			0
as it turned out , mr @entity3 was right to suspect that his wife , who he says asked him for a divorce on christmas day last year when he allegedly found she had been having an affair with a truck driver she met over the internet , would want to cash in on his lucky break			1
as soon as the @entity59 programme was broadcast , she went to court in a belated bid to ensure she received a share			0
the case went before a district judge at @entity65 last thursday , when mr @entity3 was ordered to detail in writing how the money was spent ; an injunction imposed days earlier ordering him not to spend his winnings – if any remained – was kept in place ; and the case was adjourned			1
the couple , who are in the process of getting divorced , neither looked at or spoke to each other throughout the brief hearing			0
outside court , mr @entity3 told the @entity76 how the show , presented by @entity78 , changed his life when he was at his lowest ebb , saying : ‘ i was over the moon to have won that amount			2
i was told @entity22 could lay claim to it so i decided , “ she is not getting a penny ”			0
’ moment of triumph : @entity3 appearing on @entity12 host @entity78 on @entity59 's @entity12 , where contestants can win up to £ 250,000 mr @entity3 married customer services adviser @entity5 in the @entity91 in september 2009			1
the couple already had one child , now aged six , and decided to have another baby , now 22 months old			0
the family moved to rent a bigger house near @entity65 but their debts began to mount			0
mr @entity3 said his wife told him late last year she ‘ did n’t love him any more ’ and by the time he found out he was going on the gameshow in april , mr @entity3 had moved out and was sleeping on the floor of his cramped parents ’ house			1
he said he was ‘ absolutely disgusted ’ by his wife , saying : ‘ how does she have the right to this money ? my life has broken apart , i ca n’t see my kids every day any more and i have lost everything i have worked for over 11 years			0
’ mrs @entity111 refused to comment			0
on @entity12 , contestants pick one of 22 sealed boxes containing hidden amounts of cash ranging from 1p to £ 250,000 , then eliminate the other boxes one by one			2
mr @entity3 gambled by turning down offers of £ 22,250 and £ 13,000 from the show ’s mysterious ‘ banker ’ to ‘ deal ’ and quit the game , instead carrying on until the end to win the £ 50,000 in his box .			2

@entity3 cleared £ 15,000 debts , spent £ 4,000 on a second - hand @entity44 and put £ 2,000 aside to pay for divorce legal fees
