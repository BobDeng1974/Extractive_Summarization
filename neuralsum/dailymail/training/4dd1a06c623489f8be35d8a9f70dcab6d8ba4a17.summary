real estate tycoon @entity0 blasted president @entity1 on tuesday for his handling of the @entity4 crisis overseas , telling @entity5 that putting servicemen and women in close proximity to the deadly virus is ' morally unfair to the soldiers , and to the soldiers ' families			1
' the perennial @entity14 maybe - candidate said in an interview that exposure to @entity4 is inevitable for the hundreds of @entity18 military personnel serving in @entity19			1
and it may be only a matter of time , he predicted , before men and women in uniform contract the disease – which kills between 50 and 70 per cent of its victims			2
' you 're going to see a whole new kind of " hell to pay " if they catch it , ' @entity0 said			2
' he has been hit from so many angles , for so many mistakes that he 's made , ' @entity0 explained			2
' @entity1 has become immune to " hell to pay "			1
' already a group of about 40 soldiers and army officers – including a major general – are languishing in quarantine on an @entity51 military base			1
the army calls the situation ' controlled monitoring , ' according to @entity77 , but it 's a distinction without a difference			0
there 's been no indication from the @entity82 that any @entity18 personnel are sick , but a plane carrying @entity85 major general @entity42 , the commander of @entity44 , was met on the base by medical staff in full hazmat gear			1
' what 's not being said , ' @entity0 told @entity5 in a discussion about the situation on the ground , ' is they have to make sure they do n't come back into this country if they have it			1
if our soldiers catch it , that would be absolutely – terrible			0
' the @entity82 did not respond to questions about why this group of officers and enlisted personnel was being kept in quarantine			0
@entity82 policy dictates that ' as long as individuals remain asymptomatic , they may return to work and routine daily activities with family members ' even after exposure to @entity4			0
@entity116 press secretary @entity115 said monday that the @entity82 ' has not issued a policy related to their workers that have spent time in @entity121			0
' speaking tuesday before taking off for a political rally in @entity124 , president @entity1 told reporters that military quarantines are handled differently from civilian situations ' because they are , first of all , not treating patients			1
second of all , they are not there voluntarily , it ’s part of their mission that 's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me			0
' running ? @entity0 has toyed with a presidential run in the past and might be gearing up his @entity141 rhetoric for a stab at the ultimate prize in 20126 but regardless of what they 're doing 4,600 miles away from the nation 's capital , @entity0 says @entity1 should n't be the only world leader to order deployments			1
' i do n't think we should be sending our armies ' to western @entity44 , he said			1
' we 're the only ones who send our soldiers , while we 're $ 18 trillion in debt			0
' while he allowed that it may be appropriate for @entity18 military engineers to build the kind of infrastructure needed to keep @entity4 in check in the @entity162 , he still fixed his gaze on @entity44 's other side			1
' why are we the only ones doing it ? ' @entity0 asked			0
' @entity166 's not doing it			2
and @entity166 takes a lot out of @entity121			0
you know , they take a lot ! and @entity172 's not doing it			2
nobody 's doing it but us			0
' the @entity116 did not immediately respond to a request for comment about mr. @entity0 's remarks			1
and the @entity1 administration has n't addressed the thorny problems related to potentially quarantining the full complement of service personnel in western @entity44 – 4,000 in all			1
the @entity185 have recommended that defense secretary @entity186 impose a mandatory 21 - day quarantine for all servicemen and women , including @entity191 troops , who return from the ebola hot zone			2
commander - in - chief : @entity1 said tuesday that soldiers are in a different situation from health care workers because ' they are not there voluntarily ; it ’s part of their mission that 's been assigned to them ' @entity115 said monday that the @entity116 ' will let the @entity82 make an announcement ' on their own timetable			1
asked about the wisdom of sending thousands of troops to @entity44 without a set policy dictating how they might get home , he insisted that ' we ’re going to let science drive that process			0
' the administration , which is arguing against requiring quarantines for doctors and nurses upon their return from @entity19 and other nearby nations , might soon be in the position of mandating them for men and women in uniform			1
' it 's so sad			0
so sad , ' @entity0 said			0
' they 'll send 4 thousand soldiers over there , ill - trained , ill - equipped , never heard the word " @entity4 " before this whole thing started a couple of months ago , and now nobody knows how they come back			2
' ' and nobody knows whether they come back sick ! ' it 's a very sad thing , ' he said			0
' and our soldiers should never have been sent over there .			0

real estate tycoon says @entity18 should n't send its armies to western @entity44 unless @entity166 and @entity172 put their own troops at risk
after a raft of mistakes , @entity0 says , ' @entity1 has become immune to " hell to pay " '
military men and women will be exposed to @entity4 , he told @entity5 , and it 's ' morally unfair to the soldiers , and to the soldiers ' families '
dozens of the 4,000 military personnel deployed to western @entity44 are now subject to *isolation* in a quarantine ward on an @entity51 military base – including their commanding @entity256
the @entity116 could soon be in the position of requiring quarantines for soldiers who had limited contact with @entity4 while not requiring them for doctors and nurses who cared for patients
