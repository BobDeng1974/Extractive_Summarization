with @entity1 and @entity2 heading towards 30 , the look - out is on for a new generation of stars to make football glamorous into the next decade			1
@entity6 and @entity7 spring to mind and if last night ’s dazzling display in the @entity10 is anything to go by , @entity13 ’s @entity12 could end up the likeliest lad of all			2
the 22 - year - old had a growing reputation before this tournament – after his two brilliant goals against @entity21 the hype is now ready to go through the roof			1
the second was all about striker ’s instinct following a good team move			0
put simply , the reason it ’s @entity13 - and not @entity21 – who will face @entity41 in the @entity26 quarter - final is down to one man			1
for that , we should all be grateful to him			0
there was a bit of head - scratching when @entity50 paid £ 37million for @entity12 a year ago			1
now we know what all the fuss is about			0
given the @entity54 shirt for the @entity26 , @entity12 opted to put his first name , @entity56 ( pronounced @entity57 - ez ) on the back , no doubt to the delight of his marketing men			1
having scored in all of his group games against @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , yesterday was the real test against opponents who know how to defend and were highly motivated after the @entity69 furore			2
he passed it with flying colours			0
@entity21 defended stoutly for 28 minutes			2
then , @entity12 found a little pocket of space outside the penalty area – and that is all he needed			0
as @entity76 cushioned a header into his path , he took a perfect first touch on his chest , serenely swivelled 180 degrees and sent a dipping left - foot volley that dipped neatly under the crossbar			0
an exquisite finish and he even had the presence of mind to lead the hip - swivelling goal celebration afterwards that is a tribute to @entity13 ’s other famous export , @entity89			0
belt : @entity12 's stunning first could rival @entity31 for volley of the tournament @entity56 : the @entity13 star has chosen to have his first name on the back of his shirt his second goal after 50 minutes killed @entity21 ’s hopes			1
to prove his range , this was simple and deadly , a ghosted run into the penalty area to convert @entity105 ’s headed assist from close range , this time with his right foot			0
every big club in @entity108 , the @entity110 ’s top guns included , will want @entity12 now			0
he leads the race for the @entity26 golden boot with five goals			1
the only other player to have scored in every game is @entity1			1
@entity12 has a long way to go but one day he may take the @entity118 ’s crown as the best in the world .			2

@entity12 could be lead the next generation of stars of world football
scored twice against @entity21 to lead his side into the quarter - finals
has five goals at the @entity26 so far , with @entity1 on four
@entity2 managed just one before @entity30 's group stage exit
