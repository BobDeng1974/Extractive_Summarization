when she bought 14 of princess @entity2 's dresses at @entity3 in june 1997 , @entity0 had no idea that in just three months , they would become virtually priceless			1
after @entity2 's death in a @entity10 car crash , the @entity7 businesswoman set up a charitable foundation which was supposed to display the gowns around the world and continue the princess 's legacy			1
but instead ms @entity0 racked up at least $ 2.5million in debt through failed exhibitions , and tomorrow faces the embarrassment of auctioning off all 14 dresses to pay off her creditors			1
it 's a sad end for the historic dresses , which include the stunning midnight - blue @entity24 gown the princess wore when she danced with @entity26 at the @entity27 in 1985 , and two used in her iconic @entity30 photoshoots with @entity31			1
sad end : @entity34 businesswoman @entity33 poses with one of the dresses on display at @entity39 's @entity38 ahead of the auction			1
the proceeds will help pay off ms @entity0 's debts although they went on display across the world , including at @entity47 in @entity48 , they also wound up at less - than - glamorous locations including @entity50 and an old furniture shop in @entity52 , @entity34			1
ms @entity0 , 50 , hopes to make around $ 4million from tomorrow 's auction in @entity39 , which comes ahead of the @entity54 and @entity54 of @entity56 's official visit to the country next week			1
auctioneers @entity59 's say some of the proceeds will go to the @entity61 , but much of it will be used to pay off ms @entity0 's debts			0
she filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , after using the dresses as collateral to secure a $ 1.5million loan for a housing project which ended in failure			2
iconic : princess @entity2 wore this stunning midnight - blue @entity24 gown when she famously danced with @entity26 at a @entity27 dance hosted by @entity71 in 1985 @entity72 : the dresses up for auction include this @entity76 black halter - neck , left , worn by @entity2 at @entity77 in 1994 , and right , another @entity79 gown , worn by the princess during a 1991 visit to @entity81 her attorney , @entity82 , told the @entity83 : ' a lot of her money was spent on that real estate development that went sour			1
but she worked out a plan to pay all her creditors in full			0
' after these dresses are sold , her creditors will be paid first			2
and the dresses are far more valuable than what she owes			2
' she bought the gowns at @entity3 in @entity93 in june 1997 , when princess @entity2 auctioned off 79 of her dresses , raising $ 3.25million for her favourite charities			1
at that time they cost ms @entity0 $ 670,000			0
tomorrow , many will go for that sum each , with the iconic @entity24 expected to fetch around $ 1million			1
all but one of the dresses were made especially for @entity2 , and half were designed by @entity76			1
they include a black halterneck dress she wore at @entity77 , which is expected to fetch up to $ 275,000 , and an elegant red dress and coat in which she attended the 1990 première of @entity107			1
enduring : this grey crepe gown , covered in pearls , which @entity2 wore for this famous @entity31 photo shoot for @entity30 in 1997 , was in the @entity39 auction red carpet frocks : the sale includes this crushed velvet gown , worn to the 1985 première of @entity116 , left , and a black @entity118 dress , right , worn to the @entity119 première the same year there is also a @entity118 gown , in dramatic black velvet , which she wore to the première of @entity119 in @entity48 in 1995 and is listed at $ 175,000 - 225,000			1
shortly after @entity2 's death in september 1997 , ms @entity0 announced her plan to take the dresses around the world , hoping to inspire young girls and make millions for charity in an exhibition entitled @entity133			1
she set up the @entity134 , which intended to ' perpetuate the charitable objectives supported by the late @entity2 ' , according to an @entity137 form at the time			2
by 2001 , the dresses had toured @entity140 , the @entity141 and @entity142 , netting more than $ 1.5million for the foundation , which gave the money to @entity145 and the @entity146 , the @entity83 reports			1
but the foundation was already running into trouble as expenses began to mount			0
in the first year alone , ms @entity0 spent more than $ 1milion on legal fees , public relations consultancy and building the exhibits , and she had to loan it $ 1million of her own money just to keep it going			0
up for auction : princess @entity2 wore this @entity76 tartan dress at a ball in aid of the @entity159 in 1991 , left			1
she wore the red dress and coat , right , to the 1990 @entity107 premiere by 2001 , the foundation was beginning to flounder , according to its tax filing for that year			2
it read : ' insurance on the dresses during transportation was very high , and attendance and retail sales at each venue were well below projections			0
' ' the exhibit was shown at three venues , however none provided a profit			0
' she loaned the exhibition to @entity47 for a short time in 2002 , but her attempts to hold a glamorous charity fundraiser at @entity2 's former home failed miserably when sponsors failed to materialise			2
the foundation lost $ 115,878 in preparing for the event , and had to refund $ 47,250 in ticket sales			0
in a 2004 tax filing seen by the @entity83 , the foundation borrowed $ 38,000 from the @entity188 , and another $ 50,000 from @entity189 , whose former husband founded @entity191			0
two years later she decided to turn to real estate development , and borrowed $ 1.5million from @entity193 - using the dresses as collateral - to fund a housing project			2
sold ! a @entity3 's auctioneer celebrates in 1997 when the iconic blue velvet dress @entity2 wore when she danced with @entity26 is sold in @entity93 but that , too , failed to go ahead , and in 2009 @entity193 sued ms @entity0 and the foundation , asking for five of the dresses			1
by the time she filed for bankruptcy in january the following year , ms @entity0 owed around $ 3.5million , including $ 1million to @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
with auctioneers estimating the 14 gowns could make as much as $ 4.15million , ms @entity0 will at last be hoping the dresses can bring her financial help rather than woe			1
in the auction catalogue , she wrote : ' it is time to close the " @entity220 " chapter of my life and focus on my greatest love , my desire to use my time , talents and treasure to serve @entity226			0
