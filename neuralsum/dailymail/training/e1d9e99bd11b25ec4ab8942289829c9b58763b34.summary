by @entity0 squandered : £ 1 in every £ 6 of taxpayers ' money is wasted by ministers - totalling £ 120 billion last year alone , according to a new report ministers managed to waste £ 120billion of taxpayers ’ money last year – enough to give every family in @entity10 a new kitchen or write off the whole of the country ’s deficit , a hard - hitting report has claimed			1
in a study published today , the @entity16 ’ @entity15 has revealed that one pound in every six spent by the government last year ended up being ‘ squandered ’			1
the @entity20 highlights £ 120billion of waste , the equivalent of £ 4,560 for every @entity10 household – two and a half times the amount they found when they first conducted the exercise a decade ago			1
the campaign group has calculated that curbing waste would save enough money to send every taxpayer to the @entity31 in @entity32 , or pay for the equivalent of three years ’ worth of average energy bills for every single @entity10 household			1
the report concludes : ‘ £ 1 in every £ 6 of government spending in 2012 - 13 was wasted			2
the value of savings could pay for a new kitchen for every household or a trip to the @entity31 in @entity43 for every taxpayer			0
‘ the amount of waste revealed is greater than the @entity10 deficit and is bigger than the @entity48 of @entity49			2
’ the report suggests bringing public sector workers ’ pay packets , pensions and sick pay in line with those in the private sector			2
one of several examples of ' waste ' given in the report the @entity61 's alleged £ 33,000 spend on potted plants it also claims the @entity64 spends too much money on doctors ’ wages and clinical negligence claims – and points out the need to rein in the welfare system			1
it even suggests scrapping the entire @entity72 and transferring all its functions elsewhere , a move it believes would save the taxpayer around £ 1billion			0
but the study also lists some smaller but no less worrying examples of waste			0
for example the @entity80 spent around £ 70 purchasing a bunny outfit and the @entity61 government allegedly splashed out £ 33,333 on potted plants			0
chief executive of the @entity15 , @entity85 , called for a ' war on waste ' to secure a better deal for taxpayers a @entity91 council officer was paid £ 1,000 to investigate a picture of the mayor looking at her phone during an @entity96 ceremony while another council forked out £ 32,000 to compensate a man who slipped on a berry in a churchyard			1
the heart of @entity102 blew £ 2,340 on only six pictures of herbs , and the @entity105 spent £ 342,000 on a tv series that has still not been completed – as its production company has been dissolved			0
meanwhile @entity109 council spent £ 3,860 on a whisky tasting event for international golfers and the @entity112 lost spare parts for an anti-aircraft missile system worth £ 527,000			0
@entity85 , chief executive of the @entity16 ’ @entity15 , said : ‘ we need a war on waste if taxpayers are to secure a better deal from the endless layers of government which are spending their hard - earned money			1
‘ politicians and bureaucrats are still squandering our cash while families struggle with punishing levels of taxation			0
‘ rooting out wasteful spending once and for all will mean that more money can be left in the pockets of taxpayers , who are by far the best judges of how their own money should be spent			0
’ but @entity137 general secretary @entity136 criticised the report , saying : ‘ these made - up numbers are based on extreme views – that every nurse is overpaid and that people who have worked hard and paid into the system should not get benefits			2

ministers managed to waste £ 120billion of taxpayers ’ money last year
it equates to £ 4,560 for every @entity10 household - enough to clear @entity10 's deficit
report by @entity15 claims figured is two and a half times the figure wasted 10 years ago
