@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 ( pictured left to right ) will be put on the spot this week when broadcasting chiefs announce fresh details of planned televised election debates but there is continuing speculation that the debates may never be screened because of squabbling between the rival parties and the broadcasters			1
the prime minister has complained that the debates are too close to polling day , mr @entity1 says it is unfair to exclude him from the @entity0 versus @entity2 showdown and mr @entity2 is worried that allowing @entity35 leader @entity34 to take part in two of the debates is a major threat to @entity40 ’s fading hopes north of the border			0
veteran political inquisitor @entity43 has been tipped to host one of the programmes some @entity47 mps have urged mr @entity0 to boycott the debates altogether on the grounds that with a superior personal rating in the polls to mr @entity1 or mr @entity2 , he has most to lose by debating with them live on television over three hours or more			0
@entity10 and @entity54 , which have won the right to broadcast the @entity0 versus @entity2 clash , are reportedly planning to ‘ empty chair ’ the debate if the prime minister refuses to take part			2
that could make it tricky for mr @entity2 if he opts to appear on his own as he would face the prospect of being interrogated by new @entity10 recruit , veteran political inquisitor @entity43 , who has been tipped to host the programme			2
invitations to join the two debates of seven leaders will be sent to mr @entity0 , mr @entity2 , mr @entity1 , mrs @entity34 , @entity71 ’s @entity70 , @entity73 leader @entity72 and @entity75 leader @entity74			2

and if they win , it is certain to provoke similar demands from rival parties in @entity84			1
