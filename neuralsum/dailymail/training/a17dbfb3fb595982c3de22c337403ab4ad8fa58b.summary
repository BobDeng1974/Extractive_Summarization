in the future will it be possible to have houses that expand and contract as it gets hotter and colder ? that ’s the dream of a team of students who have designed a shape - shifting prototype that can bend and twist at high temperatures			1
the structure responds to temperature changes which could allow for future constructions that can be shape - shifted as needed using heat - carrying wires embedded in the structures			1
researchers at @entity16 ’s @entity15 of @entity17 have designed a prototype structure that can change shape ( shown )			1
when it is heated above 60 ° c it expands and grows into a new form and holds its shape when it cools the project is the work of students @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity28 from @entity16 ’s @entity15 of @entity17 ( @entity29 )			1
their supervisors are @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			0
called @entity36 , the project makes use of something called @entity39 ( @entity39 ) to create the responsive architecture			0
scientists from the @entity42 have created a shape - shifting material from wax and foam it 's hoped the material will lead to robots being able to change from a rigid to liquid - like state			1
it is self - healing , and the material could be used to build deformable surgical robots , which would move through the body with ease to reach a particular point			0
it could also be used in search and rescue situations in the future			0
when the temperature is raised to 60 to 70 ° c ( 140 to 158 ° f ) , the prototype undergoes geometric deformations in an origami - like process			1
as it cools it retains the newly acquired shape , returning to its original flat state when it is heated again			2
while this means it only moves when it is heated , the team says it is an important goal towards architecture that can respond to its environment			2
the prototype is made of plywood , with embedded wires heating the various triangulated segments			2
through expansion alone the prototype could increase its surface area by up to four times , reports @entity79			2
as to the potential uses of the prototype , @entity28 tells @entity82 : ' at the moment we envision a multi-purpose public structure or pavilion that is able to transform on a daily basis depending on the specific need , site , amount of users , and event			2
' for example , imagine an outdoor gallery or performance space that can be reshaped for different scenarios			0
' as for houses , it ’s too early to say but it could perhaps be most incorporated into a home ’s main living space			0
' perhaps in the future the ability for a living and entertaining space to be able to transform and host a variety of guests or events would be interesting			0
' while this means it only moves when it is heated , the team says it is an important goal towards architecture that can respond to its environment			0
the prototype ( shown ) is made of plywood , with embedded wires heating the various triangulated segments drones and gravity ( shown ) can also be used to pull it into different arrangements			1
when it cools it solidifies in the new position and flattens when heated again			1
while only a prototype for now the researchers say it could one day lead to houses that change with temperature in addition they show how , when heated , the prototype does n’t just expand - it can actually be moulded as well			1
they demonstrated this by using drones , inflatables and gravity to pull the structure into new shapes			1
‘ we decided that , to best suit our want for structural adaptability we needed to find a geometry that could arrive on site in an original state and then having the capacity to deform or expand into a desired shape from actuation forces , ’ @entity28 explains on his website			0
‘ therefore , a somewhat foldable structure was deemed to be able to give us this required expansion upon arrival on site , which is why we looked into rigid foldable origami patterns			0
