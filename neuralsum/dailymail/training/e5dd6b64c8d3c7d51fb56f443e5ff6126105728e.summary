in a case which will rocket an already hefty legal bill to more than £ 100,000 , three @entity12 judges have given the green light for @entity16 , 48 , to challenge the landlords			1
most of the money funding the case is being paid through legal aid			1
in a case which will rocket an already hefty legal bill to more than £ 100,000 , judges have given the green light for @entity16 to challenge landlords the owner of the mobile home site , who has no alternative but to contest the case in the @entity12 , branded the use being made of legal aid as ' outrageous ' and an ' absolute disgrace			1
' he is facing legal costs of £ 50,000 or more which will have to be paid out of his own pocket			2
the courts have been told that @entity16 's history includes heroin addiction , issuing death threats to site residents , wandering the @entity4 woods in camouflage clothing including a masked camouflage hat and has had weapons seized by police from his caravan			1
he was jailed for seven days by @entity49 in 2010 after he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress			0
he opted for prison rather than a fine			0
@entity16 was jailed for seven days by @entity49 after he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress in august 2011 , in the light of his behaviour , a judge at @entity61 terminated his licence to occupy the site leaving him with the option of removing the mobile home or selling it			1
that order won the backing of three of the country ’s top judges - @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 - in the @entity76 last year			0
@entity16 , who estimates he has currently run up legal aid bills of around £ 60,000 , had instructed human rights and civil liberties law firm @entity80 and barrister @entity82 to argue that he had been discriminated against and his human rights had been breached			1
but @entity73 , said in his judgment , which was unanimously approved by the other judges , that @entity16 had approached a resident , @entity86 , with threats to kill him and two other residents			2
he continued : ' he threatened mr @entity86 with a martial arts stick			0
he said " i shoot rabbits , i could shoot you			0
" ' the judge added : ' he has a strong interest in martial arts and in weapons , including bayonets and knives , which have been removed by the police			0
' he likes to wander in the woods near the site in camouflage clothing , including a masked camouflage hat , which makes his appearance very startling to residents of the site			2
' @entity107 mobile home site in @entity108 where @entity16 has been asked to leave on a later search of @entity16 ’s mobile home police found a ' substantial collection of weapons or weapon - like objects was found ' the judge said			1
in backing the county court judge who paved the way for @entity16 to be evicted , @entity73 said that @entity16 suffers from a mild learning disability , autistic traits and an anxiety disorder and has a history of heroin addiction			2
but he said the county court judge had taken all this into consideration			0
he ruled : ' the judge ’s conclusion was not a perverse one			0
' @entity16 admitted his legal costs are around the £ 60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected he said that in view of @entity16 ’s ongoing anti-social activities , both before and after he was given notice of the consequences of it continuing , and its detrimental effect on the legitimate rights and interests of the other residents and of the claimant , it was ' difficult to see how the judge could properly have arrived at a different decision			1
' now though , the @entity145 - @entity144 , @entity146 and @entity147 - have paved the way for a hearing which could stack up a total legal bill of £ 100,000 or more			2
cases before the @entity12 are normally argued by top earning qcs			0
@entity16 , who was happy to wear some of his camouflage gear this week and pose in it for a photograph , admitted his legal costs are around the £ 60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected			1
he added : ' if i get evicted i would become homeless and have to live in my two man tent and cost the government even more money			2
' however , @entity160 , owner of the site , in @entity108 , who is not legally aided and who has already had to pay out £ 30,000 in legal costs and anticipates this will go up to £ 50,000 or more with the @entity12 hearing said : ' the whole situation where some - one can use public money in this way is an absolute disgrace			1
it ’s outrageous that after him losing in the @entity61 and the @entity173 they are still prepared to fund him in the way they are			0
' there is something drastically wrong with a system that allows public money to be used in this way			0
' no date has yet been fixed for the @entity12 hearing but it will probably be next year .			0
