by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 18:14 est , 9 august 2013 all babies born in @entity2 could have the @entity4 flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years			1
@entity6 said there was nothing he could do to prevent the emblem from replacing the royal crest on birth , marriage and death certificates			1
the communities secretary warned the move was part of a @entity18 plot to brand people as @entity21 citizens ‘ from cradle to grave ’			1
from cradle to grave : all @entity2 birth , death and marriage certificates will be stamped with @entity4 flag from next year he said the plan , contained in the @entity30 , was part of an insidious campaign to stamp the @entity4 flag across all tiers of public administration and undermine nation states			1
his warning came after the @entity4 unveiled new identikit blue - and - yellow certificates emblazoned with the 12 - star flag			2
they will have legal force across the continent from early next year			0
for now , these will be available alongside national certificates , so parents will be able to ask for either a @entity2 certificate or a @entity21 one			2
the idea is to make it easier for migrants to move around @entity21			0
@entity18 has not yet demanded that @entity4 certificates become compulsory , but mr @entity6 said it was only a matter of time			1
anti @entity4 plan : communities secretary @entity6 called the move a ' @entity18 plot ' he used the example of driving licences , where at first it was optional for countries to put the 12 - star @entity4 symbol on new documents			1
five years later it became mandatory , and in 2011 they were rebranded as ‘ @entity21 driving licences ’			0
the @entity4 regulation on birth , marriage and death certificates is due to be reviewed in three years , and sources close to mr @entity6 said they feared it could become compulsory then			1
because it is being implemented under the @entity30 , which was signed by the last @entity73 government without a referendum , such a move would not need the say - so of the @entity2 parliament			2
moves towards standardised @entity21 birth certificates will revive memories of the 1980s decision to harmonise the design of passports across the @entity4			1
@entity2 was forced to drop its popular black hardback design , and replace it with a flimsier burgundy version			2
however , the @entity2 was at least allowed to keep the royal crest on the front			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ from cradle to grave , @entity2 are now to be stamped with the @entity4 flag , as @entity18 starts interfering in people ’s birth , death and marriage			1
‘ this imposed @entity93 - law is part of an aggressive propaganda campaign to bully councils and public institutions into flying the @entity4 flag at every opportunity			2
’ he added : ‘ this @entity4 stamp wo n’t be optional – just look at the euro - creep of the @entity4 flag ending up on every driving licence			0
‘ eurocrats are brazen about their political agenda to advance their “ @entity21 project ” , wipe nation states off the map , and remove the @entity107 and our royal crest from public life			2
’ in future years , the @entity111 also has plans to widen the number of public documents available in @entity21 form , including those relating to adoption , real estate and the absence of a criminal record			0
thrown out : a sample of a @entity2 birth certificate with the royal crest new - born rules : as councils must issue the new documents from next year , all babies born in @entity2 could have the @entity4 flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years it raises the prospect of @entity2 having to present an @entity4 document to prove they do not have a criminal record when they apply for a job			1
the birth certificates are part of new @entity4 regulations which will come into force next year			1
tradition : the royal crest will no longer feature on @entity2 certificates using powers granted by the @entity30 , the @entity111 will order local councils , which administer register offices , to offer birth , marriage , civil partnership and death certificates with the @entity4 flag at the top			1
the multilingual standardised forms are blue and yellow , and are topped with the @entity4 flag			0
languages on the form include @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , but there are no national symbols			0
this means that , in @entity2 , there is no place for @entity161 ’s coat of arms			0
the @entity111 has said openly that it wants to promote the idea of @entity21 citizenship , and even has a £ 265million propaganda budget to support it			0
for example , 2013 has been branded the ‘ @entity166 ’			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity111 denied that the certificates would be mandatory			0
he said the idea was to make it easier for people who move to other @entity4 countries and have to prove their identity			0
at present , the different languages on national certificates were causing problems for migrants , he said			0
he added : ‘ it is plain wrong to suggest that the use of these certificates will become mandatory as the text of the proposal is absolutely clear that the certificates are an optional alternative but not in any way a replacement for national certificates			0
