' the family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago			1
now , they 've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing , as @entity7 joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil			1
twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana			2
@entity62 legalized the oil february 26			0
in @entity65 , lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products , while still banning smoking			2
marijuana extract oil first received attention when a @entity74 family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had @entity14			1
it is similar to hemp oil , which is legal in @entity7 and can be bought in grocery stores			2
with no known cure for @entity14 , children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures			1
however , the heavy drugs often come with side - effects that can permanently damage a child 's developing liver , kidneys and other organs			0
proponents of cannabidiol oil , a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana , argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children			1
over time , mrs @entity12 hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on			2
' like any parent , you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control , ' she said			0

but even in 2003 , her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare , genetic disorder			0
it was n't until @entity12 lost all speech and potty control when she was two that doctors determined she had @entity14 , mrs @entity12 said			1
since then , @entity12 ' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures , but the disease is tricky to manage			1
@entity14 often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type			2
@entity12 ' seizures usually occur at night , which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns			2
during the day , @entity12 requires constant supervision			0
while most 10 - year - olds freely run and jump around , @entity12 walks - albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs			0
mrs @entity12 said working with @entity7 's @entity172 - controlled @entity171 has been easier than anticipated			2
lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea , she explained			0
this year , the bill is endorsed by @entity178 senator @entity178 and representative @entity179			0
both are chairs of the legislature 's @entity182 , panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance			0
the measure unanimously passed the @entity190 committee during its introduction hearing , which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee			0
yet the bill must survive a statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose .			0
