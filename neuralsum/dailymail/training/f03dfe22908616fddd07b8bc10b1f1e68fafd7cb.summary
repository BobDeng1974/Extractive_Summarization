it is definitely smarter that the average computer - and it set to bring a new level of intelligence to everything from dresses to drones			2
@entity7 has unveiled a new smart camera system that can sense depth - and it could revolutionise the way we interact with machines			1
the chip giant showed off a tablet that can use hand gestures to scroll a recipe , drones that can manoeuvre an obstacle course without human intervention and even smart clothing that can help the visually impaired navigate safely - and a smart cocktail dress that can repel people who invade the wearer 's space			1
the legs move when somebody invades the wearer 's personal space , or they become stressed			1
the dress rises when the wearer is stressed out ( right ) but returns to normal ( left ) when they calm down @entity7 's @entity28 printed dress in action - the dress can sense the wearer 's mood during its keynote , @entity7 also unveiled a tiny wearable computer , called @entity45 , that is the size of a small button			1
@entity7 's button sized @entity49 for wearable computers while the @entity52 hardware is based on @entity7 's first purpose - built system - on - chip ( @entity54 ) for wearable devices and is expected to ship to manufacturing partners in the second half of this year			1
packed into the tiny computer is @entity59 , sensors and battery charging capabilities			2
it will help firms make smaller smartwatches and other wearables			0
@entity7 ceo @entity66 also used the keynote to show off the company 's @entity69 technology for seeing and understanding depth			1
' the rise of new personal computing experiences , intelligent and connected devices , and the wearable revolution are redefining the relationship between consumers and technology , ' he said			0
during his keynote at the annual @entity81 show in @entity82 , he also called for tech firms to hire a more diverse workforce			0
' our goal with @entity7 technology is to help solve real problems and enable experiences that are truly desired by people and businesses			1
' in order to do this , we must also do more to lead the growth of diversity and inclusion within the technology industry			0
' women and under - represented minorities will continue to play a greater role as consumers , influencers , creators and leaders			0
' @entity7 also showedoff experimental designer @entity106 's latest @entity105			1
' fashion and tech are merging at the moment , beyond blinking dresses or cute skirts , she said			0
' i 'm showing how fashion can be thought provoking , something that pushes people to think and share their feelings			2
@entity28 - printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs which move			1
' @entity105 acts as the interface between the body and the external world , ' said @entity106			0
' it uses technology and the garment as a medium of interaction			0
' the so - called animatronic arachnid limbs on the @entity105 know exactly when someone is invading the wearer 's personal space			1
the legs are driven by computer and sensor technologies that allow it to be autonomous , but assistive and adaptive to the owner 's emotions and desires			1
' since the system based with mechanic spider legs is literally hosted on the shoulders of the wearer and attacks using the same viewing angle as the wearer , the system knows how you feel and adapts to those feelings , ' she said			1
giant screens driven by @entity7 's @entity152 technology at the 2015 @entity81 ( @entity81 ) in @entity82 @entity153 gestures while interacting with @entity154 at the @entity7 booth during the @entity81 the technology uses @entity28 and infrared cameras to allow the user to interact with images on a monitor			1
using wireless biometric signals , the system makes inferences based on the stress levels in your body			0
it can differentiate between 12 states of behavior			0
@entity106 calls it an interesting interplay between co-control and education of your own body and mind			0
' when approached at an aggressive pace , the system answers in a territorial attack mode , ' she said			0
' but when you walk up to the dress in a more cautious , friendly symbiotic way , you can almost get the dress to invite you closer , as if to ' dance ' with you			2
' ceo @entity66 also used a keynote tuesday to show off the company 's @entity69 technology for seeing and understanding depth , showing off : @entity190 with @entity191 : @entity7 and @entity190 have collaborated to create a cooking application that uses @entity69 technology to eliminate the need to touch the device and instead use gesture control and voice commands on an @entity69 3d camera enabled device for easy scrolling through the application and navigation of recipes in real time			1
this will be available in the @entity206 of 2015			0
all - in - one pc with @entity208 : @entity7 showcased a futuristic ' @entity210 ' technology that integrates @entity69 technology with a specialized glass screen to enable an immersive , hologram - like experience without the need for additional eyewear			1
@entity69 technology and wearables : looking into the future , @entity66 also demonstrated a wearable technology research project that can help vision - impaired people navigate their environments more easily and safely			2
the wearable solution places sensors on clothing , equipped with @entity225 cameras that sense the vicinity and trigger vibrations as a feedback mechanism , helping people to navigate their environment			2
@entity69 technology inside robotics and @entity234 drone : @entity7 demonstrated an @entity236 ® 500 video collaboration robot equipped with @entity69 cameras to support the platform 's autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance technologies			1
in addition , @entity7 highlighted the growing possibilities for multi-copter drones , including the inspection of fields and power lines , delivering goods , and even monitoring endangered species			1
as these drones become smarter , they can see , react , and even move safely through the environment			0
during the @entity81 keynote , @entity7 created a make - shift obstacle course inside the @entity81 keynote ballroom and demonstrated a number of @entity256 * @entity258 multi-copter drones equipped with @entity69 cameras that provide 360 - degree sensing and enabled with unique collision avoidance capabilities			1
@entity7 's @entity69 camera module , which weighs as little as 8 grams and is less than 4mm thick , brings depth perception to drones both indoors and outdoors with minimal impact to payload and flight times			1
@entity7 hopes to put the realsense system into laptops and tablets			2
the @entity69 technology of software and depth cameras enables more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices , the firm says			0
cutting - edge facial detection and tracking , emotion detection , 3d scanning , depth - sensing photography , background removal , and the tracking of 22 joints in each hand for accurate touch - free gesture recognition are some of the new capabilities made possible with @entity69 technology			2
@entity290 founders @entity289 shows off the wrist mounted drone , he 2014 ' make it @entity295 ' challenge winner and the first wearable camera that can fly			1
@entity290 rests on your wrist like a bracelet , then unfolds and takes flight on cue to take the perfect shot of you in the moment			0
it is hoped the @entity290 will go on sale later this year			0
@entity66 also highlighted @entity290 , the 2014 ' make it @entity295 ' challenge winner and the first wearable camera that can fly			0
@entity290 rests on your wrist like a bracelet , then unfolds and takes flight on cue to take the perfect shot of you in the moment			0
@entity66 welcomed @entity290 founders @entity289 and @entity314 to the stage to discuss the @entity7 ' make it @entity295 ' challenge and highlighted the opportunity it offers to innovators and entrepreneurs			2
@entity66 and the founders also posed for the first @entity290 flying photo			0
@entity66 went on to say that @entity7 will sponsor the @entity7 ' make it @entity295 ' challenge again later this year .			2
