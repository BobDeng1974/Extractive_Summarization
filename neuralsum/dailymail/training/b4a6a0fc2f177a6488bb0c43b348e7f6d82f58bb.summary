by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 14:30 est , 3 january 2013 filthy houses and flabby thighs are the things we 'd most like to banish in 2013 , according to new research			1
but although cleaning up and exercising more have been named @entity9 's top @entity8 's resolutions , most of us will give up both of them by february , as the average person sticks to their new life goals for a measly five weeks			1
other top aspirations for this year include spending less money ( 26 per cent of respondents ) , dieting ( 21 per cent ) and finding a new job ( 16 per cent )			1
the top dreams for our personal lives include financial stability ( 46 per cent ) , losing weight ( 37 per cent ) and going on an exotic holiday ( 22 per cent )			1
men appear to be more career focused than women , with 16 per cent dreaming of landing a new job and 14 per cent wishing for a pay rise			0
but despite 60 per cent of us making at least three resolutions each year , 49 per cent of @entity25 fail to stick to them for more than a month			1
can you stick to your @entity8 's resolutions beyond february , or will you - like most of us - have fallen off the wagon by then ? the older we get , the better we are at seeing our dreams through to fruition with 36 per cent of 45 - 54 years olds keep at least 2 dreams for at least 6 months			1
@entity49 are most likely to make a list of their dreams , with 46 per cent of the capitals inhabitants setting themselves goals for 2013 , the @entity48 are least likely to make any with just 31 per cent pinpointing their aims for the coming year brits also have big dreams for their homes in 2013 , with 45 per cent of the country claiming that they have plans to make improvements in at least one room of their home			1
the most popular rooms that will be getting a makeover next year are bathrooms ( 38 per cent ) , living rooms ( 33 per cent ) and kitchens ( 32 per cent )			0
around 16 per cent of people say their top goal for 2013 is to find a new job , and 14 per cent of men would like a pay rise before the year is out however financial concerns may scarper our plans for home improvement , with over half of respondents saying money would prevent them from following through with a re-vamp			1
when it comes to cleaning , the average @entity83 thinks they will probably only last six weeks at their new resolution			1
some 6 per cent even said they 'll probably give up their ambition in less than seven days , while an ambitious 12 per cent aim for more than four months			1
although 46 per cent of people are dreaming of financial stability in 2013 , researchers say the best way of sticking to your resolutions is to be realistic with your targets and not plan a ' complete overhaul ' immediately @entity98 of @entity24 said : ‘ exercising , dieting and giving up things such as smoking or drinking are all traditional resolutions for the @entity8			1
' however , cleaning up the home is now top of our agenda as well as cleaning up our lifestyles			2
many of us want a completely fresh and clutter - free start to the year and as they say , a tidy house equals a tidy mind			2
’ advising people on how to stick to their resolutions , she added : ' we all know it can be difficult to keep @entity8 's resolutions especially if we set ourselves challenging targets such as losing a lot of weight in the first month , or keeping a completely spotless @entity120 realistic with your targets and do n't plan a complete overhaul immediately			1
‘ if so , you 're a better person than most			0
over two thirds of dieters will ditch their weight loss regime by the 15th of this month , according to a new poll			0
and weak - willed seven per cent of slimmers will give up by the end of day one			2
the optimum time for ditching the diet is around 11am on january 15th with dieters claiming after two weeks and one day without any treats , they often succumb during the morning coffee break			1
most people who decide to lose weight this year will have thrown in the towel by mid-january out of those who manage to hang on past then , a further 15 per cent said they keep up the healthy eating until the end of january , and 23 per cent claim they manage to stick to their new regime indefinitely			1
how long will your diet last this year ? but in the naughty corner , 21 per cent last just one week , and 34 per cent until only january 15			2
the survey of 750 adults by money saving website @entity153 found that almost a third of slimming hopefuls ( 29 per cent ) chose to join a slimming club , claiming this was the only way they were able to stay on track and keep the pounds off			0
twenty seven per cent followed an online diet and weight loss plan , with the majority ( 43 per cent ) choosing to watch what they eat , cutting out sweet and savoury treats and alcohol			0
just one per cent opted to pay for a diet plan which includes ready prepared meals			0
one respondent said : ' losing weight is one of my resolutions every year			2
normally i watch what i eat but it never works			0
' i get too tempted by the biscuits in the cupboard or even worse , end up finishing off my kids ' meals before i have my own			0
' this year i ’m definitely trying a slimming club			0
fingers crossed that ’ll do the trick and losing weight will never again be on my list of resolutions			2
' @entity187 from @entity153 , said : ' people do take weight loss seriously , especially after the excesses of @entity191 and the @entity8 , but it seems most of us falter just after we hit the two week mark			2
' f you ’re the only one in your family trying to lose weight or the only person within your group of friends , then it can be really tough			0
' it 's too easy to say you ’ll just have one glass of wine or one chocolate - it never works			0
once you ’ve been tempted , then that 's it			0
' i think it 's much harder if you decide to go it alone without any support			0
' if you join a club or follow an online plan then you have other people to rally round when the going gets tough and you 're tempted to pack it in .			0
