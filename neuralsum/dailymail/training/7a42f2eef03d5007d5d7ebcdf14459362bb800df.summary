' @entity165 also headed to @entity14 to join the search for her boyfriend @entity8 ( left ) fellow volunteer @entity197 said a group went to search for him after he did not return from the ' huge wilderness '			1
they checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might have taken , while a further search the next day also proved fruitless			2
mr @entity197 added : ' then the afternoon of the second day the police were informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but did n't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation			2
last week mrs @entity15 explained that it was out of character for her son to go missing			1
' he 's got an exploring nature , he 's intelligent , and hopefully his ability to apply himself will get him through this ' ' then the next day , the 29th , a group of volunteers went out and looked then came back again			2
another group from the local community also went out as well and went deep into the jungle			0
' the police were no longer physically looking at that point - i think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened that day			0
' it 's a huge wilderness out there - a remote location			0
he could have taken a wrong turn and just got lost in another valley - we just do n't know			0
