for most people , the game sunday between the @entity1 and @entity2 is the @entity4			1
but for many business owners , it 's simply the ' big game ' or ' game day ' , due to the @entity10 's strict policies on the trademarked name			1
the strict policy means radio hosts are tripping over their tongues and airport signs are carefully worded to keep from referring to it as the @entity4			1
so as not to infringe on the @entity4 name trademark , all non-rights holders have to use different wording to promote any @entity4 ( restaurant in @entity22 pictured ) mom - and - pop shops and large companies hoping to cash in on the game — but also do n't want to run afoul of league lawyers — have found ways to color inside the lines			1
@entity30 , whose @entity31 is located within the downtown @entity34 village , is selling souvenir tie - dye shirts			0
the garments say ' @entity31 2015 ' as well as ' the big game			0
' the $ 15 shirts come in pink , red , blue and green			0
fortunately , the restaurant owner was fully aware of the league 's reputation for coming down on trademark infringers			1
' i 'm just an @entity10 follower			2

the @entity55 page for the central @entity22 location offers recipe ideas for ' your @entity59 party			0
' signs at @entity63 ticket counters in @entity64 greet travelers with ' welcome to the big game			0
' @entity63 spokesman @entity67 said though it is the official airline for the @entity70 , the company is n't an @entity10 partner			1
' like any brand , we work to protect our valuable intellectual property and the rights we extend to our partners , ' @entity10 spokesman @entity72 said			1
what constitutes a violation is determined on a case - by case basis , @entity72 said			1
for example , a restaurant writing up a @entity4 menu on a chalkboard would n't be an issue			2
and according to trademark law , a fair use exception allows for news organizations to use the @entity4 moniker			1
this @entity51 grocery store sees a customer pass a promotional display for ' the big game ' @entity72 said if a potential infringement is discovered , the league will notify the party involved			1
if nothing changes , then a cease - and - desist letter follows			1

one of the participants in the @entity4 is not a stranger to trademark disputes			1
@entity105 has long held the trademark for the term ' 12th man , ' the nickname for the @entity2 ' large and vocal fan base			0

and the @entity10 is not the only sports organization to be vigilant about its brand			2
@entity118 has created protections for the @entity120 so it has exclusive rights to use ' @entity122 ' and the interlocking rings logo			0
international soccer governing body @entity124 is requiring countries that host the @entity126 to create special rights in their constitutions to protect advertisers , said @entity130 , a @entity131 - based advertising lawyer with the firm @entity132			0
@entity133 , an intellectual property lawyer with the firm @entity134 , said the @entity10 's monitoring is about maximizing revenue			2
' they do have a right to police it			0
they spent a lot of money to build the brand up , make it profitable and not have any @entity144 use the marks , ' said @entity133 , who has worked on licensing deals with the @entity10 and other major sports leagues			2
@entity130 said the @entity10 's enforcement is also about protecting its sponsors			2
the league creates ' official ' beers , chips , sodas and other items , which can give a business a distinct advantage over its competitors			2
' the strategy that they 're employing is to create enough concern among marketers that they 're afraid to even get close to the line , ' @entity130 said .			0
