by @entity0 sex is an effort sometimes			1
there is n’t a long - term couple alive who has n’t tossed up a romp in the bedroom versus a takeaway in front of the telly and gone for the latter			0
but if you ’re thinking of permanently trading sex for snuggles , think again			1
@entity0 says that couples who abstain from sex could be risking their mental and physical health ' oh , we stopped having sex long ago ! ' , some couples cheerfully inform me			1
' we ’re passed all that now			0
the longer you ’re with your partner , the less sex you have because of what ’s called ‘ habituation ’ : removal of the novelty factor			1
but there are very , very good reasons to fight this and keep getting physical with your @entity32 might think it ’s not that important but research shows if sex is non-existent , relationship dissatisfaction soars to 50 to 70 percent			1
and that ’s not all that will go wrong for each of you …			0
you 'll feel disconnected to your partner			0
you can remain physically connected by hugging , kissing and sleeping naked but for most people , sex is the most intimate act			1
for men , particularly , sex is a way of expressing love if they ’re not great at articulating their emotions			1
take sex off the table and you remove the most intense , effective , important way of showing affection			1
love without sex is friendship			1
@entity0 says that love without sex is inevitably just friendship sure , you ’re each other ’s best friends but is that really all you want to be ? friends ? you 'll be snappy and irritable			1
do n’t underestimate how sex acts as a buffer against the challenges you face in your relationship			1
if you ’ve had great sex the night before , you ’re far less likely to flip when you see the rubbish still sitting in the hall			2
knowing you ’re desired and wanted by your partner , endorses your sense of self - worth			0
it makes you feel attractive , loved , special			0
even if have both joked about the fact that you ’re not having sex anymore , the closest couple are left with a nervous residue of uncertainty			2
did they agree to abstinence because they really could n’t care less about sex ? or because they want to please me ? you 'll increase the chances of an affair			1
here ’s the thing about sex : when you stop having it , you stop wanting it ( which is how couples end up agreeing - openly or implied - to do without )			2
but sex does n’t go away			2
sexual images are everywhere and sexy people are all around us			0
all it takes is a certain set of circumstances ( all too often in the form of another person who ’s attractive and does want to have sex with either us or our partner ) and suddenly a desire for sex can come flooding back			2
what then ? they know you are n’t interested or vice versa			0
what do you do with that resurgence of desire ? no surprise that there ’s a significant link between sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity			2
you 'll lose your mind - literally			0
sex is good for you , both physically and mentally			2
sex makes us smarter : scientists found indulging regularly leads to better performance on learning and memory tests			0
it comes as no surprise that there 's a significant link between sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity you 'll get more headaches and migraines			0
orgasms release oxytocin and endorphins which can help relieve migraines , period pains and back pain			0
if you ’re not already grabbing your partner and disappearing into the bedroom fast , this might do the job			0
studies show the risk of death for middle - age men drops by 50 per cent for men who have orgasms at least twice a month			0
sex twice a week also prevents heart disease in both sexes , reduces the risk of both breast and prostate cancer and boosts our immune system			0
is n't it time you turned off the telly ? do n’t want to end up in a sexless marriage ? @entity0 ’s book @entity162 for life is a great sex guide for long - term partners			1
