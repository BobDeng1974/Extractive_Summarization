by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 5:40 pm on 25th august 2011 anyone hoping that the first spaceman to land on @entity3 is as friendly as @entity4 could be in for a shock			1
in the latest bid to get us to cut greenhouse gases , scientists have decided that eco-conscious aliens disgusted by mankind 's emissions could destroy our planet in disgust			1
when observed from afar , the changes in @entity3 's atmosphere could label us as a civilisation that has grown out of control			1
anyone hoping for a friendly form of alien life landing on @entity3 , like @entity22 , could be disappointed			1
@entity24 scientists have decided that aliens looking down on our planet will be less than pleased with our greenhouse gas emissions aliens reaching that conclusion may then launch a pre-emptive attack to protect this perceived threat to their own way of life			1
but that is only one possibility			0
scientists are also considering other unwelcome - and far - fetched - outcomes , such as aggressive extra-terrestrials who eat or enslave us , or perhaps they are industrial types who want to improve their own technological infrastructure and so pillage ours			0
the report 's writer @entity43 and his team compiled a list of hypothetical situations to help us should we come into contact with other life forms			1
the report , a joint effort between @entity24 and @entity53 , answered the question ' would contact with @entity55 ? ' providing beneficial , neutral and harmful outcomes , the report is designed to prepare mankind for the possibility of an alien encounter on @entity3			2
beneficial neutral harmful in the best case scenarios put forward , the scientists claim that mankind could swap information to overcome hunger , poverty and disease			2
an alternative scenario could see man triumph over an alien force and learn from their technology			2
the report says : ' in these scenarios , humanity benefits not only from the major moral victory of having defeated a daunting rival , but also from the opportunity to reverse - engineer extraterrestrial intelligent ( @entity77 ) technology			0
' in the neutral category , it suggests man could feel indifferent towards any alien invaders because useful communication is not possible			2
there is even the possibility that aliens are too bureaucratic and tedious for us to join the ' @entity89 '			0
echoing the situation in the film @entity92 , in which aliens are put into a refugee camp in @entity95 , they could even become a nuisance to @entity97			0
the most harmful outcomes are also suggestions that would fit well in an apocalyptic @entity101 film script , with @entity103 - style attacks , accidental destruction of our planet or diseases wiping out the entire population			0
their suggestions to help with our survival against such events include the issuing of warnings against broadcasts that might help aliens from learning about our biological make - up			0
the first part of our contact , they add , should be limited to maths ' until we have a better idea of the type of @entity77 we are dealing with '			0
the report adds : ' a pre-emptive strike ( by aliens ) would be particularly likely in the early phases of our expansion because a civilisation may become increasingly difficult to destroy as it continues to expand			0
likely scenario ? one of the ' neutral ' situations of an alien encounter could involve a situation like that depicted in the film @entity92 ( pictured ) , in which aliens are kept in a compound in @entity95 ' @entity55 may just now be entering the period in which its rapid civilisational expansion could be detected by an @entity77 because our expansion is changing the composition of @entity3 's atmosphere , via greenhouse gas emissions ... ' these scenarios give us reason to limit our growth and reduce our impact on global ecosystems			1
' it would be particularly important for us to limit our emissions of greenhouse gases , since atmospheric composition can be observed from other planets			1

@entity3 's greenhouse gases could be viewed as a serious threat made by a *people* that are out of control
scientists draw up a list of hypothetical alien *invasion* scenarios that could benefit , not matter or harm man
