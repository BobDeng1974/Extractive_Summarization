my friend drove me back to @entity35 so i could be closer to home			0

we had a gauze from the medical kit which i was using to hold it together			0

bladed studs were the brainchild of @entity86 player @entity85 , who called then ' @entity88 ' soles and said they allowed players to run faster			1
he convinced sports firm @entity91 to take up the idea , which they incorporated into their iconic ' @entity95 ' boots , which sold by the thousands after their launch in 1994			0
the boots were promoted by footballers @entity99 and @entity101 and rugby player @entity102 , making them hugely popular amongst youngsters			0
@entity107 ( left ) called for the boots to be banned before they caused two injuries to @entity110 ( right ) , one of which required him to wear a headband to protect a gash in his forehead @entity110 was left with a huge gash in his leg after @entity117 's @entity116 tackled him in 2013 but @entity85 later warned football boot firms that the blades were becoming ' lethal weapons ' due to their development using different materials			2
his fears have since been proved right with a series of injuries			0
