by @entity1 reporter prosecutors in @entity3 have agreed to drop rape charges against a former sheriff 's deputy who was fired last month amidst allegations that he had non-consensual sex with a female inmate while she was in custody at a county jail			1
however , former @entity12 deputy @entity11 , 52 , will still be charged with a felony count of carnal knowledge of an inmate			1
it 's unclear what caused the prosecutor to drop the rape charge , and the crime of carnal knowledge of an inmate does not come with a mandatory jail or prison sentence , which means @entity11 could potentially be found guilty but not be incarcerated			1
fired : @entity11 was terminated from the sheriff 's office following allegations that he had sex with an inmate @entity11 was arrested may 27 after an inmate at the @entity29 accused him of sexually assaulting her			1

' i agree with the decision of the @entity32 ’s attorney to drop this charge , ' @entity38 said in a statement			0
