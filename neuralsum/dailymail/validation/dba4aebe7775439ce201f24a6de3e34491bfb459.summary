somewhere in the slew of congratulatory messages aimed at @entity3 after winning her first major gold medal was one from @entity5 , whose @entity8 pentathlon record she had just broken			1
the @entity10 heptathlon champion had earlier posted pictures of herself looking in superb shape as she prepares to make a comeback after the birth of son , @entity15			2
‘ @entity16 to see my record go but could n’t have gone to a more deserving athlete , ’ she said			1
‘ i know how you feel , ’ replied @entity3 , addressing @entity19 , who had just broken @entity3 ’s own @entity8 junior record			1
there is more love than loathing in this emerging three - way rivalry but it could be just what athletics needs to capture the interest of the @entity8 public			1
@entity3 won @entity29 indoor pentathlon gold in @entity30 on friday ‘ i heard that the @entity32 tennis on the @entity33 got switched off to go to the athletics to watch my world record attempt , which is insane , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ it ’s great for the sport and if heptathlon can be the driving force to get people watching athletics then it will be nothing but positive			2
the rivalry will be good in the summer with the @entity10 champion coming back and hopefully me and @entity19 coming through			0
’ all three will meet for the first time in a heptathlon at the @entity50 meeting in @entity51 in @entity52 at the end of may			1
the youngster collapsed to the floor in celebration after finishing the 800 metres fellow @entity8 pentathlete @entity19 looks on despondently after crashing out at 1.95m for @entity59 , who is just 17 but better than both her illustrious compatriots were at the same age , it will be another step on her ascent to the senior ranks			1
but if @entity3 continues her meteoric rise and @entity68 can come close to recapturing the form which saw her win gold at @entity71 , their battle could be one of the most gripping in sport this year			1
@entity3 clearly sets herself high standards			2
crestfallen after missing out on the pentathlon world record by 13 points , she burst into tears of despair			2
coach @entity79 , mother @entity80 and a host of @entity83 teammates were on hand to remind her she had become only the second woman in history to break 5,000 points in the pentathlon			0
@entity83 's @entity5 poses with her gold medal at the 2010 @entity90 @entity3 shows off her pentathlon gold at the @entity92 laying in her bed on friday night , her body exhausted after what she deemed the most gruelling day of her career but mind unable to shut down , she ran through the day ’s events			1
perhaps , she mused , if the organisers had been kinder with the competition schedule she might have been able to recover better in time for her assault on the 800 metres , the final event			0
or maybe if she had someone to push her in the 60m hurdles , she could have gone that split - second quicker			0
but her ambition should not be confused with arrogance			0
@entity3 , 22 , claimed she would be in awe of @entity108 when they next compete			2
it will be the first time they have met since the @entity71 when she finished 15th , aged 19			0
much has changed but even though she is now the world ’s @entity112 heptathlete , @entity3 remains respectful of the elder stateswoman			2
@entity3 celebrates gold in the pentathlon at the 2015 @entity117 ‘ i ’m in awe of any @entity10 champion , ’ she said			1
‘ she ’s one of the people who inspired me to be a heptathlete and i ’ve seen her do it from a young age			0
it ’s strange that i ’m now breaking her records but she ’s the @entity10 champion and she ’s got the @entity8 record outdoors			1
there ’s a big difference between the heptathlon and pentathlon			2
i do n’t know what would make me consider me her equal			0
i do n’t like all the talk about it			0
’ @entity3 has been wary of setting targets in the past but admitted a medal in @entity138 and gold at the @entity140 in 2016 were on her radar			1
‘ i did n’t imagine three years ago that i would be in this situation , ’ she said			0
‘ it has come quicker than i expected			0
i ’ll try to win in @entity144 , but i will be in my prime for @entity146 in 2020			0
’ the only problem is that by then @entity59 may be snapping at her heels .			0

@entity3 scooped pentathlon gold in @entity30
she brokes @entity5 's @entity8 pentathlon record in the *process*
@entity68 said her record could not have gone to a more deserving athlete
all three will meet for the first time in a heptathlon in @entity52 in may
