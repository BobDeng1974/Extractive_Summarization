by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 16:43 est , 17 july 2013 @entity1 loves partying with her friends , but as a plus - size woman she does n't love the treatment she gets at most nightclubs and bars			1
in fact the pretty stand - up comic was so fed up of her and her friends being stared and laughed at by men and women on nights out her that in april she decided to start her own club event , especially for larger ladies			1
@entity14 is a @entity16 - based club night designed for ' plus - size people and their friends and admirers '			1
@entity1 ( left , with plus - size fashion blogger @entity20 on one of the @entity14 nights ) started the event after becoming fed up with treatment she got in regular venues people of all sizes are welcome but any judgemental attitudes need to be left at the door			1
@entity1 , from @entity30 in @entity16 , hopes the night will be an escape from the bullying she says her and her friends have endured since they started partying aged 18			2
she said : ' i have had experiences where a guy walks up to you and offers to buy you a drink and you look over his shoulder and his friends are jeering and laughing and nudging each other i just think it would be nice to go to a place where men buy you a drink and they mean it			2
' indulge : the event 's website features a voluptuous @entity48 inspired character like regular clubs , there is music , drinking , dancing and flirting			0
there 's a dance floor and a separate area for chilling and talking			0
unlike most other night spots the dress code here stipulates dressing your fabulous curves to impress ( and they do n't want to see anything by size - ist @entity65 brand @entity64 ) and there 's even a speed meet beforehand so that anyone that has travelled a long way can meet some new friends before the night begins			2
31 - year - old @entity72 , who also works in freelance media production , says she does n't want this to be just another @entity75 ( big beautiful women ) event : ' i ’ve been going to clubs who cater for larger people for a while , both in the @entity83 and @entity65 , but they always seemed to be a special occasion , and not just like a normal nightclub , ' she told @entity86			1
' they were pretty expensive for what you were getting , and always had camera crews in for random documentaries			0
so i wanted a place for a younger crowd , where we could dress up , dance , drink and chat for a reasonable price , and with a good venue			0
the club night in @entity16 is open to plus - size people and ' their friends and admirers ' according to early reviews , the night is already attracting a glamorous crowd : a lot of these are fashion bloggers and part of the fat acceptance crowd that the comic has made friends with through plus - size blogs and forums			1
at her biggest @entity1 was a size 32 , but she lost 10 stone recently as a direct result , she says , of meeting this group of confident and beautiful women who wear their size with pride			2
' i met all these amazing bigger women who run blogs , are stylists and fashion designers			0
these women who told me i could look good , be fat , be inspirational and aspirational , ' she said			0
now she wants to do the same for other young plus - size women and rejects claims that she could be encouraging obesity by hosting these nights : ' it was only when i gained a bit of confidence that i actually felt like i wanted to lose weight and look good			1
and that ’s what all this is about – giving people the confidence to be themselves			0
’ the dress code is ' dress to impress ' and guests are encouraged to glam up ( @entity64 is banned )			0
