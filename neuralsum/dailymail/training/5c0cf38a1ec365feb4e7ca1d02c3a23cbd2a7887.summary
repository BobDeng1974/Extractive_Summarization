@entity0 has become a mother – but her baby can never know her real name or how she protected @entity5 murderer @entity4			2
@entity6 , 34 , gave birth to her first child earlier this year at the safe house where she is living under a secret identity			1
the former teaching assistant , who provided a false alibi for boyfriend @entity4 after he murdered @entity0 and @entity0 , is believed to have married her child ’s father			1
new identity : @entity0 , left , ex-girlfriend of @entity5 killer @entity4 , will have the anonymity of her new child protected her husband is understood to be aware of her shocking past despite the fact a court order has given @entity6 lifelong anonymity			1
however , the terms of the injunction are so stringent that their child can not be told of its mother ’s true identity or her role in covering for @entity4			1
it means the baby could grow up never knowing its mother became one of the most reviled women in the country after the murders in @entity5 , @entity38			2
and a separate court order may be necessary to ensure the child ’s identity is also protected			1
@entity6 served 21 months in jail for providing @entity4 with a false alibi after he murdered @entity44 and @entity45 , both ten , in 2002			1
on her release she became one of just four former @entity49 prisoners to be given secret identities , along with child killer @entity51 and @entity54 ’s murderers @entity52 and @entity54			1
police protection and a new identity for @entity6 are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions			1
victims : @entity0 and @entity0 went missing in august 2002 she is said to have miscarried twice since 2006 after becoming pregnant by different lovers			2
but it was reported in 2008 that she was preparing to marry a partner who was aware of her past			2
@entity6 was the girlfriend of school caretaker @entity4 when he was arrested soon after the bodies of @entity44 and @entity45 were found			1
they had been missing for 13 days			2
@entity4 eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in , but said their deaths were accidental			2
he had told them that @entity6 was in the house , but she had actually gone to @entity71 to visit relatives			1
although @entity6 was not implicated in the murder , she gave @entity4 a false alibi , claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings , which delayed the police investigation			1
in 2003 , she was convicted of perverting the course of justice , and sentenced to three and a half years in prison			0
a new court order may be necessary to specifically protect her child ’s identity – similar to the order which preserves the anonymity of @entity51 ’s child			1
@entity51 , convicted of killing two boys , received a new identity on her release from jail , and after giving birth in 1984 secured an additional order to protect her daughter			1
the child was initially granted anonymity only until her 18th birthday , but that was later extended indefinitely			1
it is believed that @entity51 ’s daughter did not know her mother ’s identity until it was revealed by reporters			0
@entity52 and @entity104 killed toddler @entity105 after abducting him from a @entity107 shopping centre in february 1993			0
they were just ten years old at the time , and were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment , but were released in 2001			0
both were given new identities , and have a large number of restrictions on their movements , including a ban on contacting each other			0
last year @entity104 was given a second prison sentence for downloading child pornography			1
and in may this year , his identity was changed once again after a ‘ serious breach ’ in the security of the identity he had been using			0
@entity4 , 37 , remains in jail , where he is serving a life sentence for the @entity5 murders			0
he has been attacked by fellow inmates at least twice , and is also thought to have made a suicide attempt in 2006			0
lifelong anonymity orders , like that given to @entity0 , are relatively rare - there are no more than a handful currently in place			2
they are imposed only in the most high - profile cases , where it is almost certain that criminals released from jail will attract intense media attention , and possibly the threat of violence from members of the public			0
one reason they are so rare is that most people convicted of the most horrific crimes end up spending their whole lives behind bars , so the majority of those given new identities committed their crimes when they were children and therefore attracted more lenient sentences			0
@entity51 : convicted of manslaughter aged 11 @entity51 was a famous early recipient of an indefinite anonymity order			1
she was convicted in 1968 of killing two young boys before her twelfth birthday			0
despite the gruesome nature of the killings , she was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , having been diagnosed with a mental illness			0
after 12 years in prison , during which time her mother had repeatedly sold stories about her to the press , @entity51 was released in 1980 and given a new identity			0
when she gave birth to a daughter in 1984 , the child was also granted anonymity until her 18th birthday , later extended indefinitely			1
it is believed that @entity51 's daughter did not know her mother 's identity until it was revealed by reporters			2
@entity52 and @entity54 killed toddler @entity54 after abducting him from a @entity107 shopping centre in february 1993			0
they were just 10 years old at the time , and were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment , but were released in 2001			0
both were given new identities , and have a large number of restrictions on their movements - for example , they are not allowed to contact each other			0
@entity52 , left , and @entity54 killed @entity54 in 1993 @entity104 returned to headlines last year when he was given a second prison sentence for downloading child pornography			2
in may this year , his identity was changed once again after a ' serious breach ' in the security of the identity he had been using			0
@entity0 is unusual among those given new identities , as she is not a convicted killer			0
however , her association with @entity4 caused such public revulsion that she too was granted an indefinite anonymity order for her own protection .			1

anonymity order will extend to @entity6 's child
