water hits nuclear plant in @entity2 but officials say there 's ' no danger ' 2,000 - foot berm at the @entity7 collapsed 11,000 people forced to flee @entity9 after worst floods in 130 years by @entity12 reporter last updated at 11:53 pm on 27th june 2011 as the devastating floods peaked today it was revealed that most of the residents affected in @entity9 , @entity16 , do n't have proper flood insurance			1
the town has been decimated by the floods from the @entity20 which slowly began to retreat today , although officials estimate it will be weeks before the river returns to a normal level			1
at least 4,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods , the worst in the region for 130 years			1
and most residents affected do not have the right kind of insurance , as they believed the flood prevention projects put in place after the last major flood in 1969 would protect them			0
@entity49 is expected to offer some relief			0
meanwhile a protective barrier which was holding back floodwater from the @entity53 surrounding a nuclear power plant in @entity2 collapsed yesterday , sending water gushing around key electrical equipment			1
the head of the @entity58 has been dispatched to the plant in @entity7 , @entity2 , but officials said the public is in no danger			1
after the 2,000 - foot berm was breached flood waters poured into around containment buildings forcing the shutdown of electrical power , and sparking fears that thousands could be left without power - or face rising bills - if any damage is done			1
officials said backup generators are cooling the nuclear material , and that the plant has not operated since april			1
they said there is no danger to the public			2
@entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity79 , said the breached berm was n't critical to protecting the plant , although a crew will look at whether it can be patched			2
mr @entity78 said : ' that was an additional layer of protection we put in			0
' no land in sight : these aerial pictures , taken today , show the extent of the floods that have swept away homes and destroyed lives in @entity16 immersed : homes in @entity9 are surrounded by water			1
most of the residents whose homes are affected do n't have flood insurance the berm 's collapse did n't affect the reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling , but the power supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers , the @entity58 said			1
emergency generators are powering the plant while workers try to restore power			2
flooding remains a concern all along the @entity53 because of massive amounts of water the @entity113 has released from upstream reservoirs			0
the river is expected to rise as much as five to seven feet above flood stage in much of @entity2 and @entity117 and as much as 10 feet over flood stage in parts of @entity53			2
the corps expects the river to remain high at least into august because of heavy spring rains in the upper plains and substantial @entity124 snowpack melting into the river basin			0
homes destroyed : these pictures , taken today , show the extent of the flooding that forced 11,000 to flee their homes aid : the @entity132 provides two large " bladders , " water tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water , for @entity9 's @entity136 the berm collapse comes as the @entity132 battled to remove a tiny footbridge that holds the key to saving a small @entity16 town from being engulfed in flood waters			1
up to 4,000 homes and business in @entity9 will be wiped off the map if the bridge , which has become wedged against a levee , is not removed			2
the small bridge is collecting debris , causing the water to swell violently around the levee - further eroding the last line of defence against the river @entity155			2
resistance : @entity132 specialist @entity157 , left , tests the water supply to @entity136 in downtown @entity9 today hope : @entity9 residents have started looking to recovery today although many of those affected by the floods do not have flood insurance speaking to @entity165 , @entity9 's mayor @entity164 said the man - made levees threatened to fail in the wake of the huge volumes of water			1
he said : ' if [ the levee ] goes , everything goes in this whole , this whole area , for several blocks up , several businesses			0
' we either hold this whole dike , this whole temporary dike or we lose it all			0
' although the river crested , it is still flowing at 50 times its normal rate and is expanded to 10 times its normal size			0
thin line : @entity185 's protecting homes in @entity16 were reinforced on the weekend the city has prepared for the worst with workers bolstering levees that stand between thousands of dry homes and the rising waters			2
workers sweated over sandbags on the weekend as levees were built up to six feet above the level of the rising waters			0
there is already widespread damage in the town , with mayor @entity164 reporting more than 4,000 homes had been flooded in an evacuation zone of neighbourhoods nearest the river			0
about 11,000 people were ordered out last week			1
lead excavator @entity203 has drafted in every flood fighter in the area and has even drafted in the @entity132 to help			0
washed up : floodwater is pumped out of the basement of a @entity210 building today , after the river hit its peak and began a slow retreat jutting out : a statue of a worker , part of the monument to @entity219 statue by @entity220 , pokes just out of the rising waters of the @entity53 at @entity223 's @entity222 in @entity2 he said : ' by removing the bridge its collecting debris and its causing the water to swirl and erode our dikes and what we are going to do is hook on and try and physically brute force pull the bridge away			1
' @entity235 by heavy rains upstream and dam releases that have accelerated in recent days , the @entity20 surged past a 130 - year - old record today and kept going			2
this week emergency officials focused on protecting water and sewer systems to avoid the need for more evacuations			2
problems at @entity9 's water treatment plant prompted the state @entity244 to issue a ' boil order ' on saturday for users of city water			1
it also applies to the @entity250 , about 13 miles north of town , which gets its drinking water from @entity9 's municipal system			1
reached its peak : street signs in @entity9 show the height of the flood waters at a levee today @entity164 said city officials were ' not completely sure at this point ' that @entity9 's water supply had been contaminated			1
' it has not been fully tested ... to show that it is contaminated , ' @entity164 said			0
' there is just a concern at this point , so we 're taking precautions			0
' @entity9 's @entity271 bridge over the @entity20 , which is its most important connection between the north and south sections of the city , is likely to remain closed until the crest recedes , the mayor said			1
despite the gloomy outlook , stories of people helping each other were a heartwarming counterpoint to the destruction from unprecedented flooding along the @entity20 valley in north - central @entity16			2
brought together by word of mouth , church and civic networks , social media and random encounters , those with housing and supplies to spare gave willingly to those without			0
so many opened their doors that while some 11,000 people were evacuated from neighbourhoods nearest the river , only a few hundred used shelters at @entity210 and the @entity301			1
' for the rest of the country , that is kind of mind - boggling			0
but ... that 's how we are in @entity16 , ' senator @entity307 said			0
breached : an aerial view of the @entity311 in eastern @entity2 , surrounded by @entity53 flood waters a facebook page called @entity314 drew volunteer offers to haul furniture , care for pets , clean laundry and even give therapeutic massages - many from outside town			1
@entity321 of @entity322 , about 85 miles west , posted an offer to loan her 30 - foot camper to a displaced family			1
it quickly drew a taker : a man with a wife and three children who were living in their van since being evacuated			0
' we could probably rent that thing for $ 500 a month , but i told my husband there 's no way i 'm going to be greedy , ' @entity321 , 62 , said by phone			0
' @entity339 just had better plans for our camper than renting it			0
' she was preparing to haul it to @entity9 with a load of canned tomatoes and green beans , a grill , propane and other supplies			2
' i think we 've got ' em covered , ' she said			0
a common sight was garages packed with televisions , books , clothing and other items as residents turned their homes into temporary storage units for flood victims			0
