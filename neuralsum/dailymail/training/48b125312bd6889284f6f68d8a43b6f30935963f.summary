by @entity0 the owners of a town pub in @entity3 got more than they bargained for after a sign to tempt in punters during a month of roadworks gave their pub a rude makeover			1
@entity9 , landlady of the wig and @entity11 in @entity12 , innocently sent off for a sign after 10ft tall white boards appeared in front of her pub. it was supposed to say ' @entity10 is open for business			1
' but their solution took an unexpected turn after a printing error left the sign saying ' @entity25 open for business ' instead - much to the amusement of the regulars			2
blooper : the sign left punters smirking after a missing space morphed the @entity10 and @entity11 pub into the wig and @entity34 although the missing space - and its unintentional consequences - were noticed from the start , pub staff were so anxious to show they were still open that they put it up straight away			1
speaking to @entity40 , mrs @entity9 , who runs the pub with her husband , said : ' it looked like the pub was not even there anymore - so we got a sign done to let people know we had n't closed			1
' the first sign had to go back - and then the second one had this slight error			0
but we thought " sod it , we ca n't wait any longer			0
" and it was quite funny - at least it caught people 's attention ! ' open for business : the pub in @entity12 , @entity3 , ordered in the sign huge white boards were erected outside local following : regulars at the drinking establishments have made the sign , now reinstated , a running joke while the sign was up it became a ' running joke ' with regulars at the pub , which prides itself on home - cooking all its food			1
pub regulars , and a photo of the blooper posted online attracted huge attention			0
and even though the boards have now come down and the pub 's usual signs can be seen , the lewd alternative has gained a following of its own and now hangs on the pub 's railings			2
' it became a bit of a running joke in the pub with the regulars			0
i hope some more people will come in as a result			0
we 've put it back up outside			0
