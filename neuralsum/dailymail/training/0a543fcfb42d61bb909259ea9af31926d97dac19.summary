self - service checkouts have the ability to create irrational rage and frustration			1
but these machines could be about to get a lot smarter – and soon it wo n’t be just your basket they ’re checking out			0
a patent for a system that can both profile customers while also catching thieves has just been filed by @entity14 - based @entity13			1
a patent for a self - service checkout that can both profile customers while also catching thieves has just been filed by @entity14 - based @entity13 recent research found that self - service tills have turned shoppers into thieves with one in five admitting they fail to pay for some items			1
shoppers said the most common reason for failing to pay was simply because they found it difficult to get the scanners to work properly			2
consequently , rather than spend an age trying to get the scanner to work or hunting around for a member of staff to help , they just put the item in their bag			0
some 19 per cent of shoppers said they take items every month with a typical value of £ 15 ( $ 25 )			0
if these figures are correct , total losses via these tills runs to a £ 1.6 billion ( $ 2.7 billion ) a year			0
the group , which helped develop self - scan checkouts for @entity43 and @entity44 , is currently designing ' statistical - based ' software for its smart self - scan checkout			1
the technology can determine whether the shop is in a high - crime area ; the time of day ; shopping history and queue length , according to a report by @entity53 in the @entity54			1
all these factors are plugged into an algorithm that can determine if it is likely a shopper has stolen items			2
the system will only work if a shopper is identified through a store card			0
it could also highlight products that are more likely to be stolen , such as batteries and razors , according to the patent			0
it is unclear how the shop assistants will be alerted to a high - risk shopper , but the group suggests it could help improve random checks ' in areas with a high risk of pilferage ’ as well as on new customers			1
system can determine whether the shop is in a bad area ; the time of day ; shopping history and queue length @entity43 and @entity44 claim they have not adapted their scanners to profile customers and are ‘ unlikely to in the future			1

a separate study last year found that shoppers are abandoning their purchases in supermarkets as they become increasingly frustrated at being pushed to use self - service tills			1
one in three of people has walked out of a store because of a bad experience with a self - service till , according to a study			2
however , many customers disagree and find using the technology difficult , not least because they fear being accused of theft by failing to scan items correctly			0
analysts at the retail technology company @entity132 said stores seem to be pushing ahead with the self - scan tills because it suits them rather than their customers			0
in a survey , 84 per cent of respondents admitted to needing staff assistance when using a self - service checkout , while 60 per cent preferred using traditional staffed tills .			2

patent for system has been filed by @entity14 - based @entity13
it works by using an algorithm that plugs in data on factors such as area *safety* , time of day , shopping history , customer profile and queue length
software then alerts a shopping assistant if a customer is ' high risk '
