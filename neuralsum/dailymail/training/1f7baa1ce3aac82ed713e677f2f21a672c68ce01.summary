' @entity1 has been telling customers it has its act together when it comes to distinguishing between real and fake fur , but , according to our latest investigation , it ’s violating a federal law by selling real raccoon dog fur advertised as “ faux , " ' @entity6 president @entity23 wrote in a blog post on the organization 's website			1
false advertising : a parka that @entity1 's described as having ' faux fur ' trim was found to have real fur from raccoon dogs @entity31 , the @entity6 's @entity32 , told @entity33 that the coat was sent to a lab that determined with ' a great degree of certainty that it was this particular species			1
' ' raccoon dog fur is the species we 'd consider the most misrepresented , ' mr @entity31 added			2
he noted that the animal , which is indigenous to @entity43 , is in the same family as the domestic dog , fox and wolf			1
@entity1 's subsequently issued an apology and removed the parka from its website			1
' @entity1 ’s standard vendor terms require that all merchandise must be free of any real animal fur unless expressly authorized in writing by @entity1 ’s			0
no such authorization was given here , ' the store said in a statement			0
@entity59 story : the raccoon dog , indigenous to @entity43 , is in the same family as the domestic dog , fox and wolf ' once aware that the product was made with real fur , @entity1 ’s immediately removed the product from our website.the parkas in question were sold online only and were not exclusive to @entity1 ’s			1
@entity1 ’s has never held these items in our inventories , as they are directly shipped from the vendor to customers			2
fewer than 100 of these parkas have been purchased through @entity1 ’s			0
' @entity1 's also said that it would allow returns for customers who bought the parka under the impression that it was made using fake fur			1

' according to the @entity6 's website , raccoon dogs are animals ' who in the wild seem to enjoy having a mate or friend close by			2
' ' these social animals live in pairs or small groups , and the males are helpful fathers , bringing food to their pregnant mate and helping to raise the young			0
raccoon dogs suffer and die for their fur in intensive confinement operations in @entity104 and @entity105 , and their fur has been widely misrepresented as fake fur or as a different species			0
' this is n't the first time the @entity6 has accused @entity1 's of misrepresenting real fur as fake			1

@entity118 ’s advice is that if there ’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux , it ’s best just to avoid it altogether			0
