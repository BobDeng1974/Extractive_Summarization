by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:31 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 10:45 est , 17 december 2012 actress @entity3 is being praised for her portrayal of the dogged @entity6 operative who spent years tracking down @entity7 in the critically praised new film @entity8 , but is the real life agent actually a man ? ' the guy who was on the account from 2003 to may 1 , 2011 , when @entity7 was killed , and the guy who was always saying ... that @entity7 is living in the mysterious compound in @entity16 — that guy is a guy , he 's not a female , ' writer @entity11 told @entity18			1
@entity11 is probably the most well - versed person on the @entity6 's hunt for @entity7 who is n't actually a employee at the intelligence organization			1
@entity11 called the gender change a ' literary device			2
' the role of the female @entity6 agent has the fictional name of ' @entity25 '			1
however , if true it calls into question a @entity42 feature from earlier this december profiling the ' female ' agent @entity45 's character was based on and her struggle to get along with fellow agents			1
the story claimed the agent was passed over for promotion amid widespread jealousy among her colleagues over her part in finding the terror mastermind			1
the agent also came under investigation for meeting with the makers of the @entity59 film ' @entity8 ' which chronicles the hunt for the @entity62 leader			1
government officials refused to confirm any information about the agent 's identity in the @entity42 story			1
according to the @entity42 , she has been at the center of controversy during the promotion of the film , and one of the clearest examples came after an email was sent announcing that she won an award and dozens of her colleagues were given less prestigious recognition			1
that was too much for her to bare			2
she reportedly sent an email essentially saying : ' you guys tried to obstruct me			0
only i deserve the award , ' and sent it to the entire agency			0
the ' female agent ' supposedly met with scriptwriter @entity87 to talk about her role in tracking @entity7 to his hideout in @entity90 , which lead to the terror mastermind 's may 2011 death			1
a @entity94 navy seal team shot dead @entity7 in may 2011 after a stealth raid on his compound in @entity90			0
in the aftermath of the successful raid the unnamed agent was supposedly given much of the credit for refusing to give up in the 10 year manhunt			2
the only identifying details in the @entity42 story other than gender are that the agent is in her 30s , has never been named , and still works for the spy agency in a counter terrorism unit			1
women of the film : @entity45 plays the lead character ( left ) and said that she knew the film would be politically controversial , while director @entity112 ( right ) said that the torture scenes were the hardest to film but following the death of @entity7 , the @entity42 reports that she was widely expected to get promotion - only to be passed over			1
the agent is said to have angered many of her colleagues by sending out an email saying they did not deserve the same accolades as her for finding @entity7			2
although she was given a cash award for her work on finding @entity7 missing out on promotion is said to have cost her a rise of $ 16,000 a year			0
@entity125 : the real - life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents - who she feels slowed down the progress of the search - were given awards for their work propaganda : @entity7 -- watching @entity134 on television in @entity90 before he died a profile of the agent in the @entity42 said many of her colleagues were envious of the attention she received from @entity59			1
star : many in the @entity6 are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of @entity7 ' she ’s not @entity146 , but that ’s not going to find @entity7 , ' said a former @entity6 associate			1
other colleagues said she had been treated harshly and had come under suspicion of cooperating too closely with the makers of @entity8 , which opens in the @entity94 on december 19th			2
the film has been tipped for @entity153 success and has already won a host of critics awards			2
besides new questions about the real life gender of the agent it 's based on , the film has already generated controversy with the opening scenes showing terror suspects being waterboarded and @entity94 politicians complaining that director @entity112 was given too much access			1
a spokesman for the @entity6 refused to talk about the agent but said many people were involved in the hunt for @entity7			1
spokeswoman @entity170 said : ' over the course of a decade , hundreds of analysts , operators and many others played key roles in the hunt			0
' the film 's director @entity112 has been quick to dole out praise to the unidentified agent , however			2
' with her tenacity , her courage and her dedication , really drove that lead forward and gave it a lot of traction and the interesting thing about the movie is it puts you in her shoes , ' @entity112 said during an appearance on @entity193 ' this morning			0
the @entity195 seal who wrote the controversial book detailing the assassination of @entity7 credits a ' feisty ' female @entity6 analyst for leading them to their target , after spending five years hunting him			1
author @entity202 – whose identity was revealed even though he wrote the tell - all book under the pen name of @entity207 – only refers to the woman using the pseudonym ‘ @entity210 ’ in his book			0
same inspiration ? @entity214 ' character @entity213 is thought to be based on the female agent who lead the search for @entity7 , and she is also at the center of the upcoming film @entity8 the similarities between her backstory and that of the lead character in the hit television series @entity225 are obvious			1
' i ca n't give her enough credit , ' he said during the interview			0
' i mean , she , in my opinion , she kind of teed up this whole thing			0
' in his book , @entity234 writes that he sat next to the woman during one of the long - haul flights as they headed to @entity90 for the mission , and his brief description paints a picture of a young and extremely dedicated analyst			0
' recruited by the agency out of college , she 'd been working on the @entity7 task force for the last five years			0
analysts rotated in and out of the task force , but she stayed and kept after it			0
' after the @entity251 phone call , she 'd worked to put all the pieces together ... she had been our go - to analyst on all intelligence questions regarding the target , ' he writes			0
even though the fact that the @entity6 is dominated by men is well - documented , it may be too quick to assume that the same ‘ wicked smart , kind of feisty ’ agent that @entity234 wrote about was the basis for the lead character in the @entity263 - winning series @entity225			1
however , actress @entity214 hinted at a connection during an interview about the research she did to prepare for her role as @entity213			0
' there ’s a woman @entity269 is loosely modeled on and she ’s a @entity6 officer and so i met with her and she took me to @entity6 and introduced me to some of her colleagues , ' @entity214 told @entity273			2
the @entity225 protagonist is described as being stubborn , headstrong , and outspoken			0
the same appears true for the female agent			2
' @entity210 was n't afraid to share her opinion with even the highest officers , ' @entity234 wrote in the book			0
' this was her baby			0
@entity210 and her team spent five years tracking him to get us where we were now			0
' --- @entity283 watch the trailer here			0

*journalist* close to the @entity6 claims : ' that guy is a guy , he 's not a female . '
@entity6 agent serves as basis for upcoming film @entity8
agent also thought to be inspiration for ' @entity296
@entity42 featured claimed agent was passed over despite her *brilliance*
