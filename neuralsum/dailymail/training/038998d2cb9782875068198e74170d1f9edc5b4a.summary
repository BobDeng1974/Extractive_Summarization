@entity1 people with homes in @entity3 were today warned that the property market is in ' free fall '			1
a combination of factors including the election of a tax - and - spend @entity10 government means that prices are tumbling			1
it means an end to the boom years , when thousands of @entity1 poured money into rental or retirement investments across the @entity17			0
brits who bought an idyllic holiday home in @entity3 like this in @entity21 have been warned the property market is in ' freefall ' some 200,000 of them currently own houses and flats in @entity3 , but @entity28 newspaper today warns that ' transactions are collapsing ' because owners have become too ambitious			1
@entity31 , ceo of the @entity33 agency , said : ' convinced that their housing is the most beautiful and because a neighbour has sold theirs for a good price , the sellers will not lower theirs			0
the result is that the transaction does not happen			0
' @entity43 , of @entity44 a @entity44 ( owner to @entity46 ) , said prices ' have reached such a level that buyers simply ca n’t keep up '			0
and @entity50 , of @entity51 ( @entity52 ) said tighter credit controls combined with higher taxes on capital gains had also having a devastating effect			0
@entity3 ’s highest constitutional authority has just given the green light to a highly contentious tax hike affecting foreign owners of second homes			1
the @entity62 approved the new measure on august 9 , despite claims that it was against @entity66 law			0
the election of @entity3 president @entity68 and his tax - and - spend government is one of the factors that have contributed to the fall in property prices the law imposes an extra ' social charge ' of 15.5 per cent on the existing capital gains tax related to the sale of second homes , meaning the original levy will rise from 19 to 34.5 per cent			1
the same 15.5 per cent ' social charge ' will be added to the tax of rental income , raising the rate owners have to pay from 20 to 35.5 per cent			1
all of the property professionals predict declining prices which , says @entity28 , will see the market ' go into free fall '			0
reductions of up to seven per cent have already been reported in the southern @entity87 around @entity88 , with three per cent cuts around @entity90			0
' leading indicators suggest there is a fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the third quarter and hence enter a technical recession			1
' analyst @entity97 @entity98 , of the @entity100 agency said there was unlikely to be a complete ' collapse in prices ' but decreases could be as high as 10 per cent in coming months			0
it comes as figures revealed today that the embattled eurozone is on the brink of a double - dip recession			1
a report showed that the 17 - nation economy shrank by 0.2 per cent between april and june			0
the @entity1 ’s biggest trading partner suffered the decline in output as the debt crisis sweeping the continent escalated , with borrowing costs in struggling countries such as @entity119 and @entity120 remaining high			0
but the eurozone performance still puts the @entity1 in the shade after figures last month revealed that @entity1 ’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent in the same period			2
this compares poorly with the likes of @entity127 and @entity3 , which saw better - than - expected gross domestic product growth of 0.3 per cent and zero respectively			1
@entity130 analyst @entity97 said : ' leading indicators suggest there is a fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the third quarter and hence enter a technical recession			2
' with @entity3 's economy was stagnant in the second quarter , worries that @entity140 's second biggest economy is hovering on the edge of a new recession remain			1
the preliminary estimates released today by the state statistics agency @entity144 mark the third straight quarter without growth			0
the figures were in line with @entity144 's earlier forecast for no growth in domestic product for the quarter			2
but they were better than estimates by @entity3 's central bank , which had forecast a 0.1 per cent contraction in the second quarter and a continued drop in the third quarter			2
finance minister @entity159 expressed hope for growth in the second half of the year despite the lackluster first half			0
speaking on europe - 1 radio , he acknowledged that the economy is ' too weak ' but stressed that @entity3 is staying stable even as ' most of its partners ' are in recession , including @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity1			1
the number of jobs in @entity3 and consumer spending both shrank in the second quarter , @entity144 said			2
imports grew more than exports , exacerbating concerns about @entity3 's growing trade deficit			2
while the lack of economic contraction is a relief for @entity3 's government , the lack of growth is a challenge for @entity3 president @entity68 , marking his first 100 days in office			1
the @entity10 government is focusing on raising taxes on the rich and big business to try to cut the deficit , but some economists and business owners warn this will stifle growth when the country needs it badly .			2

around 200,000 @entity193 own houses and flats in @entity3
prices tumble because ' owners are too ambitious '
it follows tax hike for foreign owners of second homes
figures also reveal eurozone is on brink of recession
in @entity3 , *gdp* has remained stagnant
@entity127 saw better than expected growth of 0.3 *%*
