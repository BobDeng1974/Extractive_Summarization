by @entity0 @entity1 does not conform to stereotypes			1
the @entity3 does not drink beer , enjoys a laugh with his @entity7 caddie and considers playing golf in @entity9 as ‘ coming home ’			1
‘ it ’s a strange thing for me as a @entity3 ; i do n’t really like beer that much , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t drink a lot of alcohol			0
i know i should do as a @entity3 but i just do n’t like it			0
i guess that ’s a good thing			0
’ after winning the @entity20 ’ championship in may , @entity1 put in a dominant display to win the @entity22 at @entity23 last month by eight shots			1
hitting form at the right time : @entity1 celebrates with the @entity22 trophy after his eight - shot win beaming : the @entity3 stands in front of the leaderboard at @entity31 after his stunning victory he celebrated his players ’ win by having a quiet dinner with @entity37 captain @entity36 and his caddie , scotsman @entity39 , before being spotted the next morning — £ 1 million richer — sitting on the floor at @entity42 playing on his phone while waiting for a delayed flight			1
@entity39 will again be on the bag at @entity46 for the @entity22 this week — where @entity1 , 29 , will start among the favourites — after successfully rekindling their partnership following a one - year break which coincided with a slump in form			1
perfect conditions : @entity1 hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during his final round at the @entity22 in june ‘ these days , a lot of golfers are so into themselves , doing their own thing , it ’s not often that people laugh , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ @entity39 enables me to laugh			1
he has a great sense of humour and brings a great spirit to the course			0
sometimes it ’s nice for someone to loosen you up a bit			0
‘ there ’s a balance to find between getting too frustrated if things are n’t going well and not getting too happy in the good times			0
but it all comes down to experience and knowing how you react in certain situations			0
‘ having @entity39 on the bag helps me achieve that			1
he ’s a very fine caddie but also he ’s a nice guy who keeps things in perspective			2
‘ it ’s so important to have respect for each other and keep a distance as well			0
you ca n’t get too close			0
we are doing business together and we both want to be successful			0
winner : @entity1 celebrates with his trophy at @entity31 as the sun sets behind him ‘ i ’ve never been to @entity46 and i do n’t know the course			1
but for me , playing the @entity22 always feels like i ’m coming home			1
it ’s real golf where you have to feel the course and play with all the conditions			2
' playing the @entity22 is about playing the game of golf			1
it ’s a mental battle and a fight			0
the fans really know golf			2
the @entity22 week says so much about golf			1
it would be amazing to win it one day			2
’ he blushes at comparisons with @entity105 but , with a re-modelled swing , @entity1 is in the process of forging a career every bit as impressive as @entity112 ’s most prolific post-war @entity111 winner			1
last month ’s @entity22 triumph confirmed that the former world no 1 ’s resurgence from a slump was complete			1
it marked the end of a miserable spell for @entity1 , who struggled to cope with the weight of expectation after winning the 2010 @entity122 and reaching the summit of the world rankings before making the controversial changes he knew he needed to stay at the top			2
technique : the @entity3 in action at the @entity129 in @entity130 last month two years after re-modelling his swing to add a draw as well as a fade , just as @entity105 did as a young man , @entity1 is now the complete player			1
‘ i have a lot of respect for @entity105 ’s achievements , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ he had the same ambitions as me in the past when he made his changes to his swing			0
‘ i could have played the way i was playing for 20 years but i would have always asked myself “ what might have been ? ” ‘ people have made the technical alterations i made sound worse and more extreme than they were			2
i just added another shot to my repertoire			0
now i ’m very comfortable with hitting any shape			0
’ victory this week would see @entity1 claim his third major — just three behind @entity105			2
he said : ‘ i believe in my ability and trust in my skills			0
then it ’s just a matter of doing it and being brave			0
’ coming home : @entity1 tees off during the last day of the @entity159 on july 6			1

@entity22 champion considers playing golf in @entity9 as ' coming home '
@entity1 arrives at @entity46 in *brilliant* form having won the @entity166 in may and the @entity22 a month later at @entity23
he will be helped by his @entity7 caddie and friend @entity39
the 29 - year - old is one of the favourites to win @entity173 at @entity46
