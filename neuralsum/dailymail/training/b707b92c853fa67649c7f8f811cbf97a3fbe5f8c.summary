women dislike having a female boss at work even more than men do , a new study has revealed			1
nearly 40 per cent of female workers in @entity8 would rather be led by a man , a @entity6 survey found			1
in contrast , just 26 per cent of men would prefer a male boss , with 58 per cent not caring either way			2
forty six per cent would not mind contrast : overall , women were more likely than men to want a male boss in the workplace , with 39 per cent wanting to be led by a man , 25 per cent preferring a female boss and 34 per cent having no preference the study , which collected responses from 1,032 @entity8 adults , found that only one - fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job			1
this included a greater percentage of women than men , at 25 per cent and 14 per cent respectively			0
however , overall , women were more likely than men to want a male boss , with 39 per cent wanting to be led by someone of the opposite gender , and 34 per cent having no preference			2
in the past 60 years that @entity6 has conducted the annual survey , women have never preferred a female boss			0
but support for female management has grown among both men and women over time			0
dislike : over the past 60 years , women have never said they would prefer to have a female boss ( file image ) in the first study in 1953 , only five per cent of @entity8 preferred having a female boss , 66 per cent wanted a male boss and 25 per cent did not mind either way			1
the recent survey also revealed workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman , compared to those with a male boss , at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively			2
women 's dislike of female bosses in the workplace could be partly due to widespread negative perceptions of women in management positions , @entity64 reported			1
according to @entity75 chief operating officer @entity74 's book , @entity73 , women can mistrust , and undermine each other at work - with 95 per cent of working females having encountered this			0
figures : the recent survey also revealed workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman , compared to those with a male boss , at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively meanwhile , although the number of female ceos of @entity89 companies has this year reached a historic high , only 4.8 per cent of this elite group are women			1
earlier this year , a @entity93 study found that women are still lacking in self - confidence , not putting themselves forward for promotion , and perceive men to have advantages over them			2
a quarter of the women ( 26 per cent ) interviewed said they felt that adopting stereotypical male characteristics could help them to get to the top of their field			0
meanwhile , one in five women ( 20 per cent ) believed gender discrimination at work had made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals			0
preference : women 's dislike of female bosses could be partly due to negative perceptions of women in management positions			1
above , nearly 40 per cent of women would rather be led by a man ( file image ) and over a third ( 38 per cent ) said lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for promotions ( 37 per cent ) was making it harder for them to reach progress up the ladder			0
other potential barriers for women making the leap into management positions were found to include lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for childcare and the ' negative ' attitudes of employers and colleagues with regard to balancing work and family life .			0
