by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 20:20 est , 20 december 2012 tragic : @entity1 , pictured , has died after being thrown from retired racehorse @entity2 , also pictured , which she was ' sharing ' with another rider a woman who had written articles warning about the dangers of riding other people ’s horses died after falling from a thoroughbred she shared with its owner			1
@entity13 suffered fatal head injuries after she lost control of the 15 - hand former racehorse named @entity2 , an inquest was told			2
witnesses said she may have tightened up and leaned forward , making the 12 - year - old mount speed up , thinking it was in a race			2
recording a verdict of accidental death , coroner @entity22 said he would write to the @entity25 about the dangers of sharing former racehorses			1
in a bitter twist , @entity29 , 28 , herself had warned about the potential dangers of ‘ horse sharing ’ – where an owner offers to share their animal in return for help with its care			1
in a newspaper interview in february she said : ‘ there is a lot of trust involved			2
owners will look you in the eye and tell you a horse is safe when they know it is a psycho			1
’ the article , which showed her pictured with mister and owner @entity50 , 19 , quoted miss @entity13 as saying : ‘ the owner is entrusting you with their horse , and you are entrusting them with your heart			1
’ on may 28 , two shocked bystanders leapt into their cars and gave chase after @entity2 charged past them on a country lane with the @entity62 rider shouting ‘ no , no , no ’ , the coroner heard yesterday			1
they found miss @entity13 lying in the road			1
she had suffered multiple skull fractures despite wearing a riding hat			0
it is not clear if the horse threw her off or she jumped off voluntarily , the inquest in @entity67 , @entity68 , was told			2
she was rushed by air ambulance from @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity68 , to the @entity74 but died on june 1			2
the hearing heard that local resident june @entity76 found the rider on her back in the @entity80			0
shared : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity81 ( left ) with @entity2 the horse , at @entity83 , near @entity73 , @entity68 sad : miss @entity1 was airlifted to the @entity74 , pictured , and put on a life support machine , but she later died the pensioner said she had not seen what caused the horse to bolt but believed that the tragic death may have been caused by rider error			1
ms @entity91 said : ‘ it is possible something made him trot on and that @entity1 tightened up and if she tightened up , a racehorse is going to think “ right i ’ve got to go ”			1
‘ she should have known that			0
if you pull a racehorse ’s head backwards and learn forwards , it ’s going to go			0
i guess that is initially what she did			0
’ tragic : @entity1 was an experienced rider , but she may have been inexperienced in dealing with emergency situations coroners today recorded a verdict of accidental death for @entity1 ( pictured , far left ) equestrian : her father said horses were @entity1 's ' passion ' and she died ' doing what she loved ' @entity112 , who had followed @entity29 in her car , said : ‘ we put her in the recovery position and she was breathing noisily when the ambulance arrived			1
’ ms @entity112 , an experienced equestrian , was asked about @entity29 ’s riding ability			0
‘ she did n’t seem to have the confidence to ride him , ’ she said			0
‘ she always looked nervous and tentative and could not ride correctly			0
the horse would pick up on that			2
‘ this tragedy could have been avoided had @entity1 not exaggerated her ability and her skills had been assessed			1
@entity1 ’s instinct was to grab hold of his head really tightly and lean up its neck , which to racehorses means “ go , go , go , you ’ve got to go faster ”			1
i think that was why he was at full gallop			0
’ miss @entity50 , who was given mister by her riding instructor , said the horse had a ‘ lovely temperament ’			2
because she was studying at the @entity140 , miss @entity50 decided to seek a ‘ sharing ’ partner for @entity2 to help out with his care			0
she said : ‘ all was well			0
i rode out with @entity1 on several occasions and she knew how to ride			1
i was confident in her ability with horses			0
’ after the inquest , miss @entity13 ’s father , @entity146 , said : ‘ these things happen			0
‘ riding horses was her passion			0
she died doing what she loved			1
