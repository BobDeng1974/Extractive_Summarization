' unreasonable ' : budget airline @entity3 charged businessman @entity8 a total of £ 135 to cancel a £ 306 flight he booked in december , which mr @entity8 claimed was a ' rip - off on top of a £ 60 flight cancellation fee and £ 17 credit card charge @entity3 also ' retained ' the £ 38 baggage fee and £ 20 seat allocation fee			1
mr @entity8 said he was happy to pay the cancellation fee and credit card charge , but claimed the additional charges were only legally enforceable if they were seen to be ' reasonable '			1
deputy district judge @entity31 rejected @entity3 's claim at @entity33 it was entitled to the full fees because mr @entity8 agreed to the terms and conditions			1
instead , judge @entity31 ruled @entity3 's terms and conditions were ' unreasonable '			2
he awarded mr @entity8 his £ 58 baggage and seat fees plus £ 50 legal costs			1
@entity3 told @entity42 on sunday the policy was ' clearly stated in our terms and conditions which passengers agree to ' ' that 's the equivalent of 44 per cent as a cancellation charge , ' he told the @entity50			0
' in my opinion , that was wholly unreasonable and i challenged them to justify it			0
' their response was that they were entitled to make those deductions under their terms and conditions			0
' he added : ' this was never about the money			0
it was all about the principle that one should not accept what is blatantly unfair			0
' this has implications for millions of passengers travelling using budget airlines			0

' @entity3 permits refunds within 24 hours of the booking subject to a cancellation fee of £ 30 per passenger , per flight which allows customers to retrieve money from an unwanted flight while covering our administration costs			2
