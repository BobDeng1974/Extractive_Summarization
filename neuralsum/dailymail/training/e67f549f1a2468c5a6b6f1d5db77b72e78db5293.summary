by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 18 march 2013 a call girl has scrapped plans to start up @entity3 's first ever escort service on the islands due to a lack of business			1
a woman named only as honey , a 46 - year - old @entity10 , is believed to have started offering her services earlier this year in the main port in @entity13			1
she wanted to start a full time business called @entity15 and charged Â£ 180 an hour			1
but she only had two emails in six months			2
vice : the harbour town of @entity13 in @entity3 where @entity9 is believed to have been offering her services she said : ' i do n't know if i could pay my bills if i stayed			1
i have a lot of local clients			2
' if they are married , they are worried about putting something in the back of their wives ' minds			2
' according to @entity9 , @entity3 would often travel to @entity29 , where she is based , because they were worried members of the community might find out			2
one even travelled to @entity32 to see her			0
last week she sought to reassure the community about the nature of her work telling the @entity37 that she is ' a very professional lady '			0
she said : ' i just do n't want people to think i 'm a drug addict that 's come to @entity3 or that i 'm selling someone else or trafficking girls			0
' honey was visiting the isles around once every three weeks and would normally stay for a long weekend			1
most of her clients were rich oil workers , often from @entity29 , she said			0

councillor @entity53 , 54 , was shocked to discover the vice trade had reached @entity3 and said such services was an exploitation of women			1
prostitution is not against the law in @entity60 but loitering or soliciting for sex in public is considered to be antisocial behaviour and can warrant an asbo being issued			0
