early in the build - up to @entity3 ’s winning goal on sunday , @entity0 challenged for successive headers in the centre circle and lost both			1
that does n’t mean he was at fault for what happened in the subsequent 20 seconds but it was illustrative nevertheless of a long , sapping afternoon for @entity11 and their fading captain			2
@entity0 ’s time at @entity11 will now end in anti-climax			1
the chances are that he will say his farewells via a series of short cameos , many of them as a substitute			2
@entity0 was denied the chance of a happy ending as @entity3 beat @entity11 at @entity23 @entity11 captain @entity0 reacts as @entity24 celebrates @entity3 's victory on sunday @entity0 looks on dejected as his @entity11 career draws to an antic - climatic close at @entity23 by the time the @entity30 final rolls around next month his thoughts will already have turned to a new life in @entity32			1
his manager @entity33 said after his team ’s defeat that @entity0 had been excellent			1
sadly , that is n’t true			0
@entity0 was poor throughout , unable to shift the momentum of a @entity11 performance that will rank as one of the great disappointments of the club ’s recent years			1
if @entity33 had hoped for a display from @entity0 that would fit the rather romantic narrative of him returning to @entity23 on his birthday then he was disappointed			1
@entity0 ’s efforts fitted not the occasion but instead a @entity11 team showing that was low on energy , wit or strategy			1
for the latter , of course , @entity33 himself must take the blame			1
@entity0 was disappointing in midfield , as he has been all season , but @entity33 must take the blame @entity0 was deployed in a number of different roles by @entity33 ( right ) throughout the contest without a trophy for the third season running and unlikely to qualify for the @entity65 , this is a campaign that must now be labelled a failure			1
as such , @entity33 will head in to the summer under gently increasing pressure at @entity69 to produce something tangible next time round			2
certainly , @entity33 failed spectacularly here at @entity23 and , as such , his sense of regret will mirror that of his captain			1
0 @entity33 is the first @entity11 manager since @entity77 in 1956 - 59 to not win a trophy in his first three seasons			1
3 @entity80 had the joint-most shots for @entity11 in this game ( three , level with @entity0 )			1
4 @entity84 was flagged offside four times , more than any other player in the game , despite only coming on at half - time			0
3 @entity11 managed just three shots on target in the game			2
12 @entity11 have won 12 of 31 games ( 39 per cent ) when @entity0 has started this season , compared to 13 of 21 ( 62 per cent ) when he has n’t			1
18 despite playing the full 90 minutes , @entity92 managed just 18 passes in the match — the fewest of any player in the starting 22			0
@entity33 changed his formation after 20 minutes on sunday			2
@entity3 had begun the game strongly and @entity11 could n’t get the ball			2
then , at half - time , he rolled his dice again , sending on @entity84 and moving @entity92 from a centre forward role that always seems so alien to him			0
@entity33 pointed out that he has done this before , stressed that his changes were n’t indicative of his own errant planning			2
it was hard to agree , though			0
the @entity107 can be a clever coach but on sunday he did n’t appear so			0
rather he looked a little muddled , unable to turn a game that only ever looked as though it may go @entity11 ’s way for the six minutes they spent in the lead following @entity112 ’s first half goal			1
facing a team and a young manager with a firm game plan that centred on the muscularity and threat of centre forward @entity118 , @entity33 seemed not to have one of his own			1
missing @entity120 through injury once again , @entity33 chose to overlook his three alternatives – @entity84 , @entity123 and @entity124 – in favour of a front three featuring @entity92 in the central role			0
it was a familiar look but equally it is a system that rarely appears to suit @entity11			0
it asks too much of @entity92 as well as taking him from the wide position from which he always looks most dangerous			0
when @entity3 had the ball and moved forwards energetically through the excellent @entity134 and @entity135 , they did so in great number , flooding the final third of the pitch with claret and blue			0
@entity11 , on the other hand , could n’t replicate it , their full - backs too deep and @entity92 too often drowning in a sea of @entity3 shirts			1
to play without a focal point is very difficult , especially in a game where the stakes are so high			0
as @entity120 continues to struggle for health , @entity11 ’s problems in that area – given the complete lack of faith in his supposed understudies – are very real and to solve that in the transfer market without the promise of @entity65 football to use as bait will be some challenge for @entity11 ’s much - discussed transfer committee			1
@entity3 players chase goalscorer @entity134 after the @entity165 midfielder made it 2 - 1 @entity167 and @entity24 celebrate with @entity134 following his crucial @entity30 semi-final goal @entity11 captain @entity0 sinks to his knees after seeing his side fall to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity172 @entity33 is the first @entity11 manager since 1956 - 1959 not to win a trophy in his first three seasons @entity0 begins to say his goodbyes as his @entity11 career edges closer to an anti-climatic end @entity0 leaves the pitch following his side 's 2 - 1 @entity30 semi-final defeat by @entity3 at @entity23 for a time at @entity23 – a very short time – it looked as though @entity112 and @entity184 may haul @entity11 to where they needed to be			1
their goal came on the back of a short period of better play when it went in off the knee of @entity3 substitute @entity191 and it seemed as though @entity33 ’ players would build off that platform			0
but as @entity33 conceded himself afterwards , too many of his team fell short			1
it ’ s a problem that has shown itself before in key games – namely against @entity200 at the end of last season and at home to @entity204 last month			0
“ it looked as though the occasion got to us , ” said @entity33			0
“ that can happen and we ’ve come up short in a few games			0
“ the focus can go awry			0
” a startling admission from a @entity11 manager , it was nevertheless hard to disagree			0
@entity3 had the edge from the get - go , they had brightness to their play , they played only with ambition and optimism			0
there was not a hint of fear			0
on the touchline in the second half , @entity33 was unable to change things			2
the @entity84 substitution did not work , @entity227 ’s deployment at full - back gave @entity11 nothing while @entity124 ’s introduction in the 90th minute came so late as to be rather pointless			2
belatedly there was some pressure but it lacked conviction			0
there was no cavalry charge and @entity0 ’s late free - kick – his one chance to make an impression – was as limp as it was by then rather predictable			2
for @entity11 ’s titan , the season ’s end can not now come quickly enough			0
@entity134 and team - mate @entity167 celebrate their @entity30 win over @entity11 at @entity23 @entity33 shouts instructions at his players , but to no avail as @entity11 slump to defeat at @entity23 @entity0 almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left , but his header was cleared off the line			1

@entity23 loss means @entity0 's @entity11 career ends in anti-climax
he was poor throughout , unable to raise performances of his team - mates
@entity0 will now say his farewells with a series of cameo appearances
but , three years without a trophy means @entity33 is one to blame
