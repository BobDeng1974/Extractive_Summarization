early evening on monday night and the @entity0 could not have looked less inviting as @entity2 trained in solitude in the sleet of an early winter ' s day			1
when they face @entity7 for real later on tuesday , there is no reason to suspect it will be any different			1
certainly it wo n't get any warmer			0
temperatures are predicted to be as low as minus five by the time this crucial @entity13 game kicks off at 8pm local time on tuesday			1
nor will this rather mundane stadium be any more atmospheric			0
a @entity16 sanction means @entity7 must face @entity2 behind closed doors			1
the @entity2 squad brave the freezing temperatures in @entity20 on monday night in training manager @entity22 says the empty stadium for the @entity25 match will not benefit @entity2 @entity26 ( centre ) , scored all four goals on sunday in the 4 - 1 win over @entity30 , runs in training punishment designed to affect the home team , it was tempting to wonder last night if it will do @entity22 and his players any favours either			1
players , after all , rely at least in part on some kind of atmosphere to quicken the blood and last night @entity2 's manager offered his own words of regret that this is the path the @entity48 governing body have chosen in the wake of violence and racist chanting that marred @entity7 games last season			1
@entity22 said : ' it will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players ' voices during the game			1
but we have no option and we must play that way			2
' many may think the local team will suffer the most damage , but i think the biggest loser is the game of football			0
@entity2 stopper @entity69 is all smiles in training in @entity20 as his side prepare for playing @entity7 on tuesday city stars were feeling the chill as many trained in snoods and winter garments ahead of the game @entity2 captain @entity78 bares the cold in @entity20 wearing a snood in training ' it 's a pity that we ca n't play with fans			1
this show is for fans and it will be a strange game			0
' it was easy to understand @entity22 's standpoint			1
the stadium will certainly have a strange feel on tuesday			0
what he must hope is that his players rise to the occasion in their minds at least			0
having taken just a point from two opening games , @entity2 must win in @entity20 if their @entity25 hopes are not to disappear down the river for another season			1
@entity2 's @entity102 midfielder @entity101 said : ' i have experienced it twice before and it is different			1
you have to keep your concentration on the pitch and try to win the game			0
@entity22 addresses his squad as he attempts to guide @entity2 to their first @entity25 win this season city have yet to pick up their first win in @entity13 , having lost to @entity113 and drawn with @entity114 @entity115 posted this picture of the snow in @entity20 - temperatures are expected to be below zero @entity119 stands greet @entity2 in @entity20 ' i do n't think it will be an advantage for us			1
' it is always good when you play away because the home fans support their team and it gives you more motivation to play well			2
' i do n't think this [ a closed stadium ] is good for either team or for football			0
' @entity7 's players did their best to liven up things up a bit on monday by suggesting their opponents from the @entity136 have some weaknesses when they do n't have the ball			1
maybe they were watching as @entity30 troubled @entity2 sporadically at the weekend			2
striker @entity139 said : ' as you can see , @entity2 are very weak this year			2
we are going to use that advantage against them			0
' in a couple of games they have n't been that good			0
they are very weak in the defence , so we are going to do our best to work against that			0
' i think we are going to have a great opportunity and tuesday is going to be a very good game for us			0
' we are going to do our best to win because this is the last opportunity that we have			0
' quite properly , @entity22 did not respond when asked about this on monday			2
the @entity156 knows that if @entity2 play anywhere near to their capabilities they will win the game , just as they did here last year			1
the @entity2 coach was willing to talk about his own midfielder @entity164 , though , and rejected suggestions that the @entity167 's future may lie as a second striker after rather indifferent @entity48 displays at the base of his team 's midfield at @entity113 and at home to @entity114			2
@entity175 shows off his skills in training , has experience of playing matches in ' empty ' stadiums anyone who has seen @entity164 play this season will recognise that he is becoming something of a liability alongside @entity101 when not at his best			2
his midfield partner had to do so much work in @entity187 that he ended the night with cramp			0
however , @entity22 insisted last night that the 31 - year - old will be back to his best before long and remains of the @entity136 's most eminent players in his natural position			1
asked if @entity164 's future lies further up the field , @entity22 said : ' it can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker			1
' but in our team he 's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role			0
' when he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the @entity136			0
' despite the peculiar circumstances on tuesday , they perhaps represents @entity2 's biggest game of the season			2
ahead of the return next month , they are already offering two tickets for the price of one			0
lose tonight and even that may not be enough to drag them through the gates			0
@entity216 ( left ) , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity115 train in @entity20 on monday @entity26 scored all four goals in @entity2 's 4 - 1 win over @entity30 at the @entity222 on saturday			1
