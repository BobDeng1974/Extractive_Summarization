and while she clearly loves a bargain when it comes to clothes and food , @entity6 managed to spend a whopping $ 7million last year on one too many good deals			2
according to @entity13 the star spent around half of her $ 14million conservatorship back in 2012 on a wide range of items varying from the thrifty , such as a @entity19 sandwich , to the extravagant - $ 3,400 on @entity21 lights			1
she loves a deal : @entity6 managed to spend nearly $ 7million last year on a number of bargains documents obtained by the website show she spent a total of $ 6.8million , which included $ 63.74 at a @entity28 , $ 11.92 at @entity29 and various receipts from a range of her favourite food chains , including @entity34 ’s , @entity35 , @entity5 and @entity36			1
it was n’t all just spent on food though - it ’s reported she spent $ 33,959 on grooming and wardrobe , which is in fact a small budget for most stars in the public eye			1
it does n’t however come as much a surprise considering just this week @entity6 was spotted wearing a top she wore the week before – showing that fashion really is n’t a priority for her			0
in control : @entity51 ( pictured here with @entity53 ) is still in charge of most aspects of @entity6 's life while much of what the 31 - year - old spent her hard - earned cash on was cheap food , she also splashed out on a few extravagant items			2
@entity13 reports she spent $ 500 on a manicure and $ 1,500 went to @entity63 – the father of her sister @entity66 ’s child			1

yummy : over the years @entity6 has become known for her love of fast food and continues to spend money on it drive - thru : documents show that @entity6 spent some of her money last year on @entity85 @entity6 ’s father , @entity86 , has been conservator of her affairs for almost five years after her life spiralled out of control in 2007			1
a judge handed mr @entity92 control of the singer 's fortune and almost every other aspect of her life after she had a public meltdown			0
at the height of her problems @entity6 lost custody of her children , @entity101 and @entity53 for a long spell which prompted an infamous rant outside @entity106 's @entity105 home , resulting in a shaven - headed @entity6 rampaging with an umbrella			0
thrifty : just this week @entity6 stepped out in a top she was spotted in again last year - showing she 's more than happy to wear an items a few times in january of last year it was reported that her father was considering halting the conservatorship as a special gift to celebrate her upcoming wedding to @entity117			2
unfortunately the couple never made it down the aisle and @entity6 never regained control of her money			0
