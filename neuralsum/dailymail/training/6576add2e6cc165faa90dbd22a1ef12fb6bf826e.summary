by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:25 am on 29th february 2012 @entity2 said it will not warn the @entity3 if it decides to launch a pre-emptive strike against @entity6 nuclear facilities , @entity3 intelligence has revealed			1
officials said they would keep @entity3 in the dark so that the @entity3 would not be held responsible for failing to stop the attack			1
the pronouncement , delivered in a series of private , top - level conversations , sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the @entity16 and @entity17			0
no warning : @entity3 president @entity19 ( left ) will not be told if @entity2 decides to launch a strike on @entity6 , @entity2 pm @entity21 ( right ) has said decision : @entity2 has said it will not tell the @entity3 in order to decrease the chance @entity6 president @entity23 will blame @entity3 for the strike the @entity3 has been working with the @entity2 for months to persuade them that an attack would be only a temporary setback to @entity6 's nuclear programme			1
@entity2 prime minister @entity30 and defense minister @entity31 delivered the message to a series of top - level @entity3 visitors to the country			1
they included the chairman of the @entity38 , the @entity16 national security adviser , the director of national intelligence , and top @entity3 lawmakers			1
all were trying to close the trust gap between @entity2 and the @entity3 over how to deal with @entity6 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity30 delivered the same message to all the @entity3 who have travelled to @entity2 for talks , the @entity3 official said in an off - the - record briefing			1
the @entity16 did not respond to requests for comment , and the @entity50 and @entity51 declined to comment , as did the @entity2 embassy			1
secretive : @entity6 says it is developing nuclear technology for fuel reasons , but a lack of transparency has led @entity58 powers to be suspicious @entity6 claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes , but the @entity61 has raised alarm that its uranium enrichment programme might be a precursor to building nuclear weapons			0
the @entity3 has said it does not know whether the @entity6 government has decided to ' weaponise ' its nuclear material and put it on a missile or other delivery device			1
the @entity6 government has hailed the success of a homegrown film at sunday 's @entity73 as a victory over @entity2			2
' @entity75 ' by director @entity76 won the @entity73 for @entity77 beating @entity2 director @entity79 's ' footnote '			2
in a state tv broadcast @entity80 , head of the state @entity81 , hailed the win as the ' beginning of the collapse ' of @entity2 influence that ' beats the drum of war ' in the @entity3 and elsewhere			1
he later claimed the @entity73 meant ' @entity3 judgment was bowed to the @entity6 culture '			2
the film explores troubles in @entity6 society through the story of a collapsing marriage			0
it tells the story of a couple heading for divorce and dealing with domestic troubles , including a young child and an aging parent			0
@entity6 conservatives were upset with the themes of domestic turmoil , gender inequality and the desire by many @entity6 to leave the country			0
in his acceptance speech mr @entity76 said he hoped the @entity73 would raise awareness of @entity6 's sizable artistic achievements and rich culture that has been ' hidden under the heavy dust of politics '			0
surprisingly the film has been a huge hit in @entity2 , where tens of thousands of movie - goers have flocked to see it since it opened earlier this month			2
the secret warning is likely to worry @entity3 officials and begin the high level meetings with @entity2 and the @entity3 far apart on how to handle @entity6			1
but the apparent decision to keep the @entity3 in the dark also stems from @entity2 's frustration with the @entity16			1
after a visit by national security adviser @entity126 in particular , they became convinced the @entity3 would neither take military action , nor go along with unilateral action by @entity2 against @entity6			1
the @entity2 concluded they would have to conduct a strike unilaterally - a point they are likely to hammer home in a series of meetings over the next two weeks in @entity135 , the official said			2
@entity31 will meet with top administration and congressional officials during his visit			0
@entity30 arrives in @entity135 for meetings with president @entity19 next week			0
the behind - the - scenes warning belies the publicly united front the two sides have attempted to craft with the shuttle diplomacy to each other 's capitals			0
' it 's unprecedented outreach to @entity2 to make sure we are working together to develop the plan to deter @entity6 from developing a nuclear weapon , and to keep them from exporting terrorism , ' said @entity155 rep. @entity154 , the top @entity156 on the @entity16 intelligence committee			2
he travelled there with the intelligence committee chairman , @entity160 @entity158 , to meet @entity2 's prime minister and defence minister , along with other officials			2
' we talked about the fact that sanctions are working and they are going to get a lot more aggressive , ' @entity154 added			0
they also discussed talked about presenting a unified front to @entity6 , to counter the media reports that the two countries are at odds over how and when to attack			0
programme : the nuclear enrichment facility in the central @entity6 city of @entity176 he said : ' we have to learn from @entity179			0
all those ( peace ) talks and stalling and they developed a nuclear weapon			0
' we are going to send a message , enough is enough , the stalling is over			0
... all options are on the table			0
' @entity158 told @entity190 yesterday : ' i got the sense that @entity2 is incredibly serious about a strike on their nuclear weapons programme			2
' it 's their calculus that the administration ... is not serious about a real military consequence to @entity6 moving forward			0
' they believe they 're going to have to make a decision on their own , given the current posture of the @entity3			2
' @entity3 intelligence and special operations officials have tried to keep a dialogue going with @entity2 , despite the high - level impasse			1
they have shared with them options such as allowing @entity2 to use @entity3 bases in the region from which to launch such a strike , as a way to make sure the @entity2 give the @entity3 a heads - up , according to the @entity3 official			1
co-operation has improved on sharing of intelligence in the region , according to one current and one former @entity3 official			0
@entity2 is providing key information on @entity228 for instance , now that the @entity3 has closed its embassy and pulled out both its diplomats and intelligence officials stationed there , the @entity3 official said .			1

mean @entity3 would not be held responsible , says @entity2
