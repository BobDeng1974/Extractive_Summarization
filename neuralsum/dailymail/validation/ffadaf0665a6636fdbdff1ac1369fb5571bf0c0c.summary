@entity1 skipper @entity0 admits the @entity2 will be left red - faced if they do not end this year 's @entity3 with a victory on saturday			1
@entity6 's side have impressed in brief spells so far this campaign but have not done enough to beat @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity12			1
they now round off their championships by hosting the @entity15 at @entity16 this weekend			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 ( centre ) passes the ball during the @entity3 match against @entity12 but with @entity22 's team chasing their second @entity3 title on the spin , they will have to produce a stunning result to spare themselves their third whitewash in 11 years			1
asked if it would be embarrassing for @entity1 to finish bottom without a win , scrum - half @entity0 said : ' well yeah			1
we do n't want to do that , do we ? ' as players that is certainly not what we set out to do			2
' but we have an opportunity this weekend to make sure we ( do n't finish with the @entity38 )			2
' that 's all we can do this year unfortunately			2
we will go out there and give absolutely everything to try and avoid ( another defeat )			1
' it 's a huge game for us but i know the boys are absolutely desperate to get out there , put in a good performance and come away with a win			1
' @entity12 's @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) challenge @entity1 's @entity51 at @entity52 @entity12 centre @entity53 is tackled by @entity1 's @entity55 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) the @entity57 impressed so much during november 's three - game series against @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 that there were genuine hopes they could perhaps mount a surprise title bid			1
but those ambitions now lie in tatters			2
the last - gasp 22 - 19 defeat to the @entity11 remains the lowest point of a black six weeks , but the clashes with @entity9 and @entity10 also saw big opportunities missed and self - inflicted mistakes prove costly			1
@entity0 now hopes his men can at least stride away from the tournament with some pride intact and avoid the prospect of stumbling towards this year 's @entity76 with heads bowed			1
' where you finish is where you finish , ' he said			0
' you ca n't have any qualms about it			0
' but we have a chance this weekend to make sure we do n't finish bottom			2
we have got to do everything in our powers to make sure that does n't happen			0
' if we get a win here it gives us some momentum going forward to the @entity76 and the four warm - up games			1
' @entity92 ( left ) charges past @entity1 's @entity94 ( right ) during the @entity3 clash @entity1 's @entity96 ( right ) makes a charge down the wing but is upheld by @entity92 ( left ) the @entity57 sparkled for 20 minutes of the first half against @entity12 last weekend at @entity52 and even led the @entity100 13 - 10 at the break			1
but they failed to build on that platform as @entity104 's men came back at them with a second - half barrage to claim 12 - point win			1
since that bruising second - half collapse , head coach @entity6 has sat his men down and pointed out the same old mistakes that keep costing them			2
but @entity0 insists those brutal home truths need to be told if the @entity57 are to improve			1
the @entity113 half - back said : ' @entity6 is an honest bloke - he does n't miss when he swings			2
' he 's been honest but he 's been good too			0
he 's a clever coach and the boys appreciate that			0
' the boys do n't mind being told			0
we watched the game back and they saw themselves some of the flaws and that makes us frustrated			0
' it really was the simple things we did well against @entity12 which allowed us to get on the front foot and take the lead			0
' but we let them off the hook in the second half			0
we almost thought , ' @entity129 , we are in the lead , we have a chance '			0
we relaxed a couple of per cent and let @entity12 come back at us			0
that cost us the game			0
' the last time @entity136 were welcomed into @entity137 they were mugged 12 - 8 by @entity139 's side and @entity0 believes the current @entity2 could learn from that 2013 display			1
he said : ' looking back to that game we just did little things well to stay in the game			0
' that will be the key again this weekend			0
we need to get into their half , hold the ball , win penalties then get the scoreboard ticking over			2
get three points , six points , maybe then a try			0
' once you start playing in their half , the game becomes so much easier			0
' @entity1 players look dejected following their 25 - 13 loss to @entity12 at @entity52 last saturday			1

@entity1 have lost all of their @entity3 games so far
captain @entity0 is desperate for his side to grab a win
the @entity2 are currently bottom of the @entity3 table
@entity0 is urging his team - mates to avoid finishing the tournament there
*unbeaten* @entity136 are the *visitors* to @entity16 on saturday
