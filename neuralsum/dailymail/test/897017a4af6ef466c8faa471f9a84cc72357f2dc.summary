@entity1 striker @entity0 believes @entity2 will only be happy if he plays regularly and hopes he will remain at the club to do that			1
@entity2 is stalling on a new Â£ 100,000 - a - week contract offer , although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess his options at the end of the season			1
the 20 - year - old , who has been linked with a number of @entity16 's top clubs , was one of four players at the @entity20 launch of next season 's @entity22 kit in front of over 1,000 fans , with one shouting from the crowd ' make sure we see you in it next season '			1
@entity1 's attacking midfielder @entity2 is stalling on a new big - money contract at the @entity20 club @entity2 ( centre right ) poses with @entity34 ( left ) , @entity35 ( centre left ) and @entity0 ( right ) the four @entity1 players huddle together on stage at the launch of their new home kit for next season @entity0 uploaded this to his @entity43 account as he posed with @entity2 , @entity35 and @entity34 at the launch @entity0 posed with his team - mates and uploaded these snaps to his @entity43 account that made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage , and speaking afterwards @entity0 said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at @entity1 but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for @entity2			1
' i do n't know what @entity2 wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly , ' he told @entity56			1
' as long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - i do n't think it is anything to with anything other than that and i hope he will stay at the club			2
' it is important , regardless of who you are , to show what you can do - not just for @entity2 but any young player			2
' it is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes i am behind him 100 per cent			0
' @entity0 experienced something similar himself when he left @entity71 for @entity72 aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at @entity74 and he left for @entity1 in january 2012 after 63 appearances in four years			1
as he matured he has enjoyed greater success at @entity20 , scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five - month absence with a thigh problem			1
since returning in january he has scored four times in 15 games and some of his performances have drawn criticism simply because he has not matched the heights of last season when , playing alongside @entity89 , he scored 24 times			0
@entity0 is bidding to return to his best form following a lengthy spell out through injury however , the @entity95 striker knew he would not rediscover his best form immediately , which he believes will only come with a full pre-season under his belt			1
' it has taken time to get back into the groove			0
i have missed a lengthy time and gaining sharpness while playing games is not easy in a league like the @entity108 - you ca n't ease yourself back in because the games are very fast , ' he added			2
' it has been a difficult season in terms of the injuries but i know i will come back strong and get back to exactly how i was performing before			0
' it is going to take time , it is not going to happen overnight , i understand that			0
' it is the sharpness and fitness side of things			0
it takes a long time and that is the whole point of having a long pre-season			0
' i am looking forward to helping the team this season and towards next season i will be right back to where i was , because i would have had a pre-season i will be back to the sharpness and fitness levels i had before			0
' @entity0 has been criticised by some supporters for failing to hit the same heights he did last season			2
