@entity0 grew up a long way from the @entity2			1
not in geographical terms , but in almost every other sense			2
raised by single mum @entity6 , the football - loving youngster spent his childhood trying to steer clear of the pitfalls that can go with growing up on a tough south @entity10 housing estate			1
the 21 - year - old tighthead prop has made a name for himself this season and his reputation is growing beyond the @entity2 , his club 's home ground			1
breaking trough : @entity0 has played a key role in @entity20 ' push for the play - offs he is quick to praise the part his mother has played in his development and says his background has ' made me the person i am today '			1
@entity0 explains : ' on the estate there was that sort of ( gang - related ) environment			1
but those guys respected me because they knew i was trying to be the best i could be with rugby and i just let them get on with whatever they were doing			2
' my mum always taught me to stay clear of trouble and surround myself with positive people			2
i worked hard , found a love for rugby and did my schoolwork to keep mum happy			2
' the 19 - stone @entity0 will be an integral part of @entity20 ' bid to snatch the final @entity45 play - off place from @entity46 by beating them at home			1
indeed , @entity0 's star is rising so fast it is not beyond the realms of possibility that if any more of the @entity54 squad suffer injuries he could be on the plane to @entity57 for the summer tour			1
saved : @entity59 prevented @entity0 from getting caught up in gang culture when he was younger breaking through : @entity0 as an eight - year - old playing for @entity61 ' i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want to play for @entity54 , ' he said			1
' that would be a massive honour			2
but my focus is on beating @entity46			2
it 's a massive game			0
' this has been a breakthrough season for him			2
he has not just filled in for injury victims @entity71 and @entity73 , but has excelled in a position where there are unparalleled physical and technical demands			0
he has shown the ability to combine his strength — he can repeatedly bench press more than 165kg ( 26st ) — with athleticism and excellent handling skills			0
he appears destined to play international rugby			2
but it could all have been very different had @entity6 , who works at a police call centre , not taken him to local rugby club @entity86 when he was eight following complaints that her son 's approach was too physical for football			1
no way through : @entity0 stops @entity94 ' @entity93 winger @entity92 in the @entity95 saracens have clinched the regular - season title and a home semi-final			1
@entity99 need a point against @entity101 to be sure of a home semi-final			0
@entity103 need a bonus point against @entity96 to overtake @entity99 if they do n’t beat @entity101			0
winners of @entity20 v @entity46 get a play - off place			1
top six have qualified for the @entity108 — @entity96 , @entity99 , @entity103 , @entity46 , @entity20 , @entity109			1
seventh - placed @entity101 face a two - leg play off against @entity110 for the last @entity112 place			1
' i was a football fanatic but i kept being a bit too physical and probably getting sent off here and there , ' he explains			0
' my mum spoke to one of her friends who said she should take me down to the local rugby club to see if i liked it			0
i rocked up in my @entity126 shirt , played a game of touch and the rest is history			0
' @entity59 became a massive outlet for me to get my anger out			0
if i was angry , instead of doing something i should n't do i could go along to @entity61 on a sunday and do something within the laws			0
at the end we 'd shake hands			0
' @entity141 , @entity20 ' director of rugby , is certain @entity0 is one for the future , saying : ' you ca n't survive as a 21 - year - old prop in the @entity45 without an edge			1
@entity0 has a lot of footballing ability and he 's also got that edge			1
his potential is very high			0
' on saturday , @entity0 will be up against @entity46 's @entity152 international @entity151 with current @entity54 tight - head @entity153 on the other side			1
he is ready for the challenge			0
' i hope they do come at me and underestimate me and then they can have a nice little surprise , ' said @entity0			1
' i 'm sure i 'll get taught a few lessons but that 's what i want			0
i want to be playing against guys like @entity151 and @entity163 instead of sitting at home watching it on tv			2
i want to be in the thick of it			0
' you 're a person of your environment			0
i 'm glad that i 'm where i am but i love where i came from			0
i 'm a south @entity10 boy at heart			0
