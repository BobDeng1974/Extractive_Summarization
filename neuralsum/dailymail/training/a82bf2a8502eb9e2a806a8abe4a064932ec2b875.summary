by @entity0 following the news @entity3 has become the latest firm to enter the drone market , researchers in the @entity2 have successfully created and tested a low - cost craft - built entirely using a 3d printer			1
engineers at @entity10 developed the prototype 1.5m - wide unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity13 ) using a cheap , common technique that builds objects using layers of plastic			1
drones are traditionally built by large manufacturers , due to the cost and complexity involved , and this breakthrough could make the crafts more common place , and even disposable			1
the craft has already completed a test flight as a glider , pictured @entity36 printers use two kinds of materials - the first is called the ‘ modelling material ’ and is what the object is made of			1
while a second , ‘ supporting material ’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process			2
the plastic is heated using the printing heads and a controlled heating chamber			0
during printing , the machine takes designs from a computer drawing and recreates it using layers of the modelling material			1
as each layer is printed , it bonds to the previous one			0
in between each layer , the modelling heads switch to support heads , which lay down the second material			2
this support material can then be washed , or snapped , off the model			0
@entity36 is slower than other printing methods , including selective laser sintering ( @entity66 ) , which uses lasers to fused particles together			1
however , by not using lasers , it makes the process much cheaper			0
the @entity13 completed a test flight as a glider , flown by researchers from the @entity74 , earlier this week			0
the manufacturing cost of the drone has not yet been released , but its researchers have said that it is significantly lower than those of large drone - dedicated companies			1
in theory it would be possible to build models similar to the drone at home , on 3d printers such as @entity90 's £ 700 @entity89 model			2
engineers at the university are now developing an electric fan propulsion system that will make the drone easier to control			0
they then plan to develop the craft so it can be guided by gps or camera technology , controlled by an operator wearing first person - view goggles			0
@entity102 's drone was created for a research project looking at @entity104 of complex designs			1
it was built using a technique called fused deposition modelling ( @entity36 ) , and is made of a polymer called thermoplastic			1
@entity36 is slower than other printing methods , including selective laser sintering ( @entity66 ) , which uses lasers to fused particles together			1
however , by not using lasers , it makes the @entity36 process much cheaper - although the actual costs depend on the materials used , the size of the craft and the printer used			1
additive manufacture development engineer @entity122 said : ' by understanding the capability of the @entity36 process and associated software , we were able to manipulate the design to contain a number of unique features as well as preventing build deformation			2
all parts required for the airframe can be combined onto a single build within the @entity134 900 machine , taking less than 24 hours with @entity137 - @entity136 material			2
' thermoplastics work out at approximately £ 5.50 ( $ 9 ) per 2kg bag , although prices vary			1
low production costs might lead to the printing of @entity104 unmanned aircraft that could be disposable and sent on one - way flights for delivery , search or reconnaissance purposes , said the engineers			1
dr @entity149 , who led the project , pictured , said the team is working to add an electric fan propulsion to the drone , pictured			0
it also plans to develop the craft so it can be guided by gps or camera technology , controlled by an operator wearing first person - view goggles the craft , pictured , designed by @entity74 ( @entity162 ) was built using a 3d printing technique called fused deposition modelling ( @entity36 )			1
engineers said the design could form the basis of cheap , and potentially disposable crafts built within 24 hours @entity36 printers use two kinds of materials			1
the first is called the ‘ modelling material ’ and is what the object is ultimately made of once complete			2
while a second , ‘ supporting material ’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process			0
the engineers said the polymer craft could be built and deployed in remote situations , potentially within as little as 24 hours			0
the @entity102 uav is made up of nine parts printed separately that are snapped together			2
it weighs less than 2kg ( 4.4lb ) and is made from thermoplastic			2
the engineers are currently looking at ways to use nylon as the printing material , in place of plastic , which would make the @entity13 60 per cent stronger , without increasing its weight			0
@entity36 printers use two kinds of materials - the first is called the ' modelling material ' and is what the object is made of			1
while a second , ' supporting material'acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process			0
during printing , the machine takes designs from a computer drawing , pictured dr @entity149 who led the project said : ‘ following successful flight testing , we are working to incorporate blended winglets and twin ducted fan propulsion			2
‘ we are also investigating full on - board data logging of flight parameters , autonomous operation by @entity156 , and control by surface morphing technology			0
‘ concepts for novel ducted fan designs are also being investigated			0
’ @entity216 revealed yesterday that @entity3 is similarly working on drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			0
he has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to ' the next 3 billion people ' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time			0
@entity229 is also working on developing drones to deliver goods to its customers .			0

drone was @entity104 printed using fused deposition modelling ( @entity36 ) technique
it builds layers of material , such as thermoplastic , using computer designs
the drone was built and successfully tested by the @entity10
it weighs 2kg , is 1.5m wide and consists of nine parts that snap together
the materials for each drone start at approximately £ 5.50 ( $ 9 )
researchers said the drone is a low - cost *option* for one - way deliveries , searches or reconnaissance *missions* - and is disposable
