many were shocked with the announcement that @entity0 and wife @entity5 , who wed in 1990 , had decided to divorce and that @entity0 would be marrying @entity7 , his youngest bride			1
the decision however was not one of the heart but rather a legal maneuver that will allow @entity0 to give the children @entity7 had when she entered the family , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , access to insurance and other legal benefits			1
of his 17 children , these three are the only ones who @entity0 is not the biological father of , meaning they had no claim to his insurance			1

@entity0 has never been officially married to his middle wives , @entity38 and @entity39			1
and within just three months of his divorce with @entity5 , he had tied the knot with wife @entity7 , the youngest and most recent addition to the group			1
@entity5 has decided to stay with @entity0 and his polygamist family as a spiritual wife			2
according to records , the 44 - year - old family head and his wife of 20 years jointly petitioned for divorce which was finalized on september 25 , 2014			0
it is believed that @entity0 wanted to bring @entity7 's three kids from a previous marriage better into the family , where they 'll have more security			1

on the show , all of @entity7 's children refer to @entity0 as ' dad ' and are referred to as @entity0 's children			1
their biological father is alive and @entity7 is divorced from him			2
on one episode of the show she tearfully revealed she as left the marriage and was driven to financial ruin getting out of it it			0

she then married his father and they had two more kids before divorcing			0

@entity5 was raised polygamist , @entity0 became one after @entity94 married @entity38 , left , and @entity39 , pictured right			1
neither wedding was ever legal @entity34 was born at home in @entity7 and @entity0 's @entity99 bedroom in 2011 , a year after the couple wed in @entity101			2
as a @entity102 present for @entity0 in 2013 , @entity7 legally changed her name to @entity104 from @entity0			2

he and @entity5 legally and spiritually wed in 1990 , he and @entity38 spiritually wed in 1993 and he and @entity39 were married in 1994			1
none of the children by his first three wives remember a time when their other two ' moms ' were not part of the family			0
he has one child with @entity5 and six with @entity38 and six and with @entity39			2
after a long period with no new wives , there was obvious friction , captured by the television cameras on the first season of @entity0 , when @entity0 decided to court and then marry @entity7 , bringing her and her three children into the already bursting household			2
but no wife was more supportive than @entity5 , who also is the closest to @entity7			0

within three months of divorcing @entity5 ( left ) he had married the youngest of his four ' spiritual wives ' @entity7 ( right ) some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for @entity5 online , but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person			1
@entity0 and his wives first appeared in @entity0 in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices			0
all his wives except @entity38 were raised in polygamist families			0
but , @entity38 's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter , and is now in a plural marriage with @entity0 's dad the series led to the @entity0 family being investigated for possible prosecution although @entity0 believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman , and the other marriages are spiritual unions			1

no word yet if the divorce and new legal marriage will feature on future episodes of the family 's @entity41 show			0
@entity5 encouraged @entity0 's courtship of and marriage to his fourth wife @entity7			1
here , a still from their wedding reception which aired on @entity41 's @entity0			1
the ceremony itself was ' too sacred ' for television			0

@entity0 stars in @entity41 's @entity0 with his four ' wives ' and children , but only his marriage to first wife @entity5 was legal
now he has divorced @entity5 and married his youngest wife @entity7

@entity5 has decided to stay with her *husband* and his other wives , @entity38 and @entity39 , who have never been legally married to the man
@entity0 said this is a way to provide the children with security and insurance
