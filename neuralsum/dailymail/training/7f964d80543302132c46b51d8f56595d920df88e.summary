by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity14 , with the pain still raw from their winter of absolute discontent , know that the public ’s patience will be in short supply if they fail to hit the ground running when they begin their international season in earnest on tuesday night			1
they may have safely negotiated an early - season trip to @entity17 but a @entity18 international against world champions @entity21 at @entity22 will provide a much stiffer test of whether @entity14 are back on the right track			1
it was here at this iconic ground last year that @entity14 began to lose the warmth of their support , even in the aftermath of a 3 - 0 @entity32 victory , when the arrogance that had crept into their attitude was epitomised by some players urinating on the @entity22 pitch during their victory celebrations			2
stepping up : @entity14 stand - in captain @entity39 prepares at @entity22 for tuesday 's @entity18 against @entity21 time to repay : @entity39 , filling in for injured @entity41 , says @entity14 owe fans after a dismal winter their world subsequently came crashing down in @entity44 and it is from somewhere near rock bottom that @entity14 will emerge under new management and following a welcome and necessary verbal charm offensive			1
@entity39 , with leadership aspirations beyond filling in for @entity41 , knows @entity14 must now regain the faith of a fanbase disillusioned by that @entity32 mauling and a @entity18 humiliation from @entity54			1
‘ i ’ve just heard that this game is a sell - out so it ’s great to know the support we have always had is no different now , ’ said @entity39			0
‘ a win would go a long way towards repaying what we owe those fans			0
’ it will not be easy			0
@entity21 are the most consistent limited - overs team in the world , having contested five of the last seven global finals , and arrived at @entity22 this week in far finer fettle than on previous early summer tours			2
yet @entity14 do not have to look too far back for encouragement as they were the only team to defeat @entity21 in that @entity18 in @entity72			0
support : @entity39 was impressed that the @entity22 had sold out for the @entity74 but knows supporters want results on a high : @entity79 skipper @entity78 kisses the @entity32 urn after a draw at the @entity22 secured a draw turnaround : @entity44 celebrate their 5 - 0 whitewash of @entity14 after the fifth test in @entity87 in january it was @entity89 , with a brilliant unbeaten 116 , who rescued @entity14 from the depths of nought for two to defeat @entity21 that day in @entity93 and @entity39 expects conditions to be similar in south @entity95 tonight			1
‘ there was dew in @entity72 and it could be the same here , ’ said @entity39			0
‘ we can take huge belief from that performance and i think it will be another high - scoring game this time			0
’ @entity89 will have a new opening partner in this match after @entity14 ’s surprising decision to jettison @entity106 , with either @entity107 or @entity108 being given the responsibility of taking advantage of the power - play overs			1
there will be no @entity113 nor @entity114 in the @entity21 side following their retirement from short - form cricket and @entity14 have turned to new assistant @entity118 for advice on those who will turn out instead			2
responsibility : @entity89 will open the batting for @entity14 having been the shining light of the grim @entity74 repeat performance : @entity39 is hoping @entity89 can repeat his 116 heroics from @entity72 against the champions ‘ he has been key to our preparation , ’ said @entity39 of the man who left @entity21 after that @entity18 win over @entity128 when he was head - hunted by @entity14			1
‘ he knows their guys inside out			0
’ @entity39 , @entity14 ’s key one - day batsman , will have the job of utilising that knowledge as captain while @entity41 continues to recover from a knee injury			1
the @entity138 will almost certainly be confirmed as permanent @entity18 captain later this summer when @entity41 is expected to stand down			2
inside knowledge : @entity39 and coach @entity141 ( left ) speak with former @entity21 mentor @entity118 ( right ) that could be just the start for captain @entity39 who , if he manages to cement a test place , remains the only viable alternative to @entity78 should things go badly for the @entity14 skipper this summer			1
‘ leadership roles are something i ’d want to take on , ’ said @entity39			0
‘ i think my strengths would be to stay calm in high - pressure situations and to make good decisions			0
i think i have a reasonably good cricket brain , too			0
’ @entity14 will need both @entity39 ’s brain and his bat if they are going to get that all - important win to set them up for the summer .			2

@entity14 face world champions @entity21 on tuesday night at the @entity22
@entity39 stands in as captain while @entity41 recovers from injury
he says they owe fans after dismal results in @entity44 and the @entity74
the @entity138 is expected to take the leadership role full - time in the *future*
coach @entity118 faces @entity21 for the first time since leaving them
@entity107 or @entity108 are expected to open with @entity89
