‘ he was somewhat jealous of @entity14 ’ , @entity0 admitted			1

what followed was months of an ‘ erratic ’ courtship with @entity14 - wildly attentive one minute and distant the next			2

that was the last time @entity0 heard from @entity14			1
‘ he did n’t speak to her again for six years , and then only in rage ’			0

i was never going to marry that pushy female ’			0
@entity0 ’s response to the too - brief engagement was to call him ‘ a s * * * ’ and suggest she was so insecure at the time it was pathetic			2
for years , @entity0 never escaped the perception of the great love affair between her and @entity1 even when she married her second husband , @entity233			1
bust up : when @entity0 spilled the beans that the crooner had proposed to a newspaper and it splashed a headline on the front page , @entity14 was incensed			1

i was nineteen and was n’t exactly swimming in self confidence			0
it ’s one area of my life i am not proud of ’			0
