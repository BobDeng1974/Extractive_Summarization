a holidaymaker was left stranded in @entity1 after thieves stole her passport @entity3 during a family holiday - and @entity6 staff refused to let her fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant			1
@entity9 and @entity10 from @entity11 , @entity12 , had gone away to the island for a three - day break , marking her birthday and the couple 's anniversary			1
but , despite having flown to @entity1 from @entity20 airport , mrs @entity18 was marooned on the island for up to two weeks after her biometric id card was stolen			1
@entity18 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , had gone to @entity1 with her husband for three - day holiday but was refused to fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant the couple were on a trip to the volcanoes when mr @entity10 had his wallet stolen , which had her biometric @entity3 , as well as their bank cards inside			1
the 37 - year - old was meant to return to the @entity34 on march 9 , but she only arrived back on march 24 - having spent more than three times what she had planned			1
the mother - of - four , who has a @entity39 passport , has now placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of @entity6			1
she claims that she has the right documentation to prove she was allowed to return to the @entity34 , but that the budget airline refused to fly her home anyway			2
she said : ' the whole experience has been humiliating			0
i will never use @entity6 again			0
' mrs @entity18 , who moved to @entity12 from the @entity47 14 years ago , does not have a full @entity34 passport because she has not yet been given permission to live here permanently			1
mrs @entity18 , with her husband @entity51 , who had her biometric id card stolen while on holiday instead , she has the ' right to remain ' status , a @entity57 stamp which shows she resides in the @entity34			1
that stamp recently ran out , she said			0
but she has a biometric @entity3 card , given to her by the @entity59 , which , when used in conjunction with her passport , proves she has the right to reside in this country			1
she has previously used it as a passport in @entity66 countries			2
prior to the holiday , mrs @entity18 had also obtained a visa from the @entity69 in @entity70 , allowing her to travel out of the country			1
after the card was stolen , mrs @entity18 travelled to @entity74 where she was given documentation to prove that her card had been stolen			1
but when she tried to return home , she was stopped at the @entity79 boarding desk and the police were called			2
she was led away , under suspicion of being an illegal immigrant			0
' they just did n't want to know , ' she said			0
' they were n't interested in seeing the papers			0
i was led away like a crook			0
i also had a driving licence and bank cards which proved i was from the @entity34			0
' mrs @entity18 , who was carrying other cards like her driving licence and national insurance card , then got paperwork from the @entity93 in @entity1 , which also verified that her card had been stolen			1
but when mrs @entity18 attempted to get home , she was turned back again			2
she alleges that a @entity6 representative at @entity97 told her : ' we send you @entity100 to @entity34 and they just send you back and fine us 6,000 euros			2
' she said : ' i was left feeling like a criminal			0
' mrs @entity18 was told her @entity39 passport would have to be surrendered and re-stamped before she could return , a process that would have taken at least three weeks			1
but @entity105 , a community activist , then intervened , speeding up the process , meaning she returned home earlier than expected			0
he described the saga as ' totally unsatisfactory in its entirety '			0
he said : ' @entity6 failed to take into account her circumstances , they failed to show any form of compassion and the fact that they stereotyped her is of great concern			0
' mrs @entity18 travelled to @entity74 where she was given documentation to prove that her card had been stolen but at the aiport she was stopped at the boarding desk and the police were called a @entity124 spokesman said the airline were right not to accept the id card as a passport substitute but a @entity124 spokesman said the airline were right not to accept the id card as a passport substitute			1
the spokesperson said : ' the biometric residence permit is proof of the holder 's right to stay , work or study in the @entity34			2
it can also be used as a form of identification			0
the holder is not required to carry their permit at all times , but they must show it at the border , together with their passport , when travelling outside of , and when returning to , the @entity34			2
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' while we apologise for any inconvenience caused , it is each passenger 's responsibility to carry travel documentation which meets the requirements of @entity6 , immigration and other authorities			0
