by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 05:39 est , 26 june 2012 @entity1 is to take on @entity2 in a war of the tablet computers with the launch of its own ‘ @entity7 killer ’ – the @entity8			1
it is a dramatic move for the @entity11 technology company , which historically has focused on producing software rather than hardware			0
but after some success with the @entity17 series of entertainment consoles , it now hopes to challenge @entity2 and @entity19 in the lucrative touchscreen tablet market			0
the @entity8 tablet was officially unveiled in @entity22 last night , and from the favourable first impressions , it looks like we have a three - way race in the tablet market			2
the surface comes with a 10.6 " screen , a clever magnetic cover which doubles as a keyboard , and a kickstand to hold it upright on a table			0
in a huge paradigm shift for @entity1 , the traditional @entity35 has been scrapped for @entity1 's new ' @entity38 ' tile - based theme			1
the new laptop-esque surface tablet computer is unveiled by @entity1 , bringing a revolutionary jump to the future of @entity42 @entity8 : the new tablet , shown here in the hands of ceo @entity46 , will compete with the @entity7 launch : the tablet is @entity1 's first foray into personal computing hardware for many years presentation : the contents of the launch were kept completely secret until the announcement was made boss : mr @entity46 shows off @entity1 's latest gadget at a press conference in @entity22 the @entity7 has been king of the tablet market since its debut in 2010 surface comes with a number of features which make it more similar to a laptop than a tablet - most notably , a built - in keyboard which could help the device appeal more to business customers			1
and the fact that @entity1 is using the same @entity72 operating system for the @entity8 as for laptop and desktop computers could mean that customers will find it easier to switch between different devices			1
ceo @entity46 was on hand at a press conference in @entity22 to announce the tablet , calling it part of a ' whole new family of devices ' the company is developing			2
the 9.3mm - thick tablet , which uses the rt version of @entity42 , comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and keyboard that is part of the device 's cover			1
it weighs under 1.5 pounds			0
in a possible nod to the device 's chief rival , it will apparently be 0.1mm thinner than the latest @entity7			0
a slightly thicker version - still less than 14mm thick and under two pounds - will work on @entity1 's upcoming @entity98 operating system			1
colourful : the surface is expected to be available for purchase some time later this year visionary : @entity1 has high hopes that the @entity8 will allow it to break in to the lucrative tablet market adaptable : the device is designed to function both as a tablet and as a more traditional laptop weight : surface 676g @entity7 650g thickness : surface 9.3mm @entity7 9.4mm screen size : surface 10.6 " @entity113 " usb : surface yes @entity7 no hard drive : surface 32gb/64gb @entity117 battery life : surface unknown ipad around 6 hours price : surface unknown ipad from £ 479 / $ 499 @entity123 , the president of @entity1 's @entity42 division , called the device a ' tablet that 's a great pc - a pc that 's a great tablet			1
' they will be available when @entity42 8 ships later this year , according to a @entity1 statement			2
no details on pricing were mentioned , except that it would be ' comparable ' with current @entity135 tablets and @entity137 - powered @entity136			0
@entity1 has been making software for tablets since 2002 , when it shipped the @entity139			2
many big pc makers produced tablets that ran the software , but they were never big sellers			0
the tablets were based on pc technology , and were heavy , with short battery lives			0
launching its own tablet potentially throws @entity1 into direct competition with its closest hardware partners such as @entity149 and @entity150			1
the price of the tablet , which will come in @entity153 and @entity155 versions , has not been revealed , but the @entity7 costs from £ 479			2
@entity1 chief executive @entity46 said the tablet will be an entertainment device ‘ without compromising the productivity that pcs are uniquely known for ’			1
@entity2 has sold 67million @entity161 in the past two years , and @entity1 is keen to grab a piece of a market where analysts predict sales will top 180million a year in 2013			2
but industry experts questioned whether the company could mount a serious challenge to @entity2			0
@entity169 , of technology analysts @entity170 , said @entity1 had to spell out how the @entity8 would be different from the @entity7			2
she added : ‘ they need to explain how @entity1 manufacturing this device will change people ’s experience with a tablet			1
’ @entity177 looks at the history of three titans - @entity2 , @entity1 , and @entity180 - as they battle for dominance			1
acceptable in 2006 : @entity184 just before the first @entity183 came out @entity1 has dragged its feet a bit too long in the tablet market - in almost an exact repeat of the smartphone market			1
the @entity183 revolutionised the smartphone market in 2007 , and then the @entity7 kickstarted the tablet craze in 2010			0
when it came to smartphones in 2006 , @entity1 were the entrenched market - leader			1
the @entity194 operating system - which was outstandingly ugly and built for a stylus , but very flexible software-wise - had more than 90 per cent of the smartphone market just seven years ago			1
it was very unintuitive - but it was all the market had , and users had to wait for the at - the - time small - fry hardware manufacturer @entity199 to come along and build a skin to show @entity1 that technical prowess could go hand - in - hand with eye - candy			1
meanwhile @entity1 could not not have a decent tablet to market			1
they had kept trying to at least create the market , but kept missing the key features people wanted : portability , usability and style			0
but @entity1 could never get deliver anything beyond clunky interfaces or heavy , style-less hardware in either market , and so they limited their potential to niche appeal			2
with @entity2 breaking new ground , this should have given @entity1 a clear goal to step in and join an established market			2
and this would have been fine , if it was not for the rise of @entity180 - or more importantly , @entity19			0
once @entity2 paved the way , @entity180 swooped in with their open - sourced , flexible and well - received operating system			1
hardware manufacturers , locked out of @entity2 's closed world , could adapt @entity19 with almost no cost and no restrictions , and quickly a swarm of smartphones , and then tablets , swamped the market - some great , some good , and others terrible			0
the sad thing for @entity1 is that this used to be them - they could license their software and different vendors , such as @entity239 , or @entity150 , could build computers or smartphones			1
but @entity180 has all but cleared up this market , and @entity1 being late to a market once again could be be deadly to the giant			0
@entity244 , despite a warm reception from critics and whole - hearted support from @entity248 , still languishes at the bottom of the mobile market , unable to gain mass - traction			0
it is still behind the long - dead @entity184 for market - share , despite all of @entity1 's advertising pushes			2
but whereas it took about four years for @entity1 to compete with the @entity183 , luckily the gap for the tablet market is only around two years			2
this may change over the next few years , but it will be hard to break into either @entity2 's hardcore fanbase , or @entity19 's million activations worldwide a day			0
the surface may not have the same hurdles			0
business professionals may find this a suitable netbook or laptop replacement			0
those who do not find @entity2 or @entity180 's offerings good for productivity may swarm to @entity1			0
and as @entity1 unifies the experience within all its markets and builds its own eco-system , containing @entity42 8 on the pc , @entity272 , and the @entity38 - themed entertainment of the @entity274 , they may win back a lost generation of people who like @entity1 's technical expertise			1
slim : the @entity8 is - perhaps not coincidentally - 0.1mm thinner than its chief rival , the @entity7 innovative : but @entity1 has not yet announced how much the @entity8 will cost when it goes on sale each device comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and a keyboard that is part of the device 's cover components : @entity1 's @entity288 gives the audience an inside look at the tablet 's built - in keyboard trendy : @entity1 appears to have learned something from rival @entity2 when it comes to presentation sales of tablets are expected to triple in the next two years , topping 180million a year in 2013 , easily outpacing growth in traditional @entity2 has sold 67million @entity161 in two years since the device 's launch			1
@entity2 , which makes both hardware and software for greater control over the performance of the final product , has revolutionised mobile markets with its smooth , seamless phones and tablets			0
rival @entity180 may experiment with a similar approach after buying phone maker @entity310 this year			0

@entity1 tablet will use same @entity72 operating system as pcs
comes with built - in stand and keyboard to replicate experience of laptop
