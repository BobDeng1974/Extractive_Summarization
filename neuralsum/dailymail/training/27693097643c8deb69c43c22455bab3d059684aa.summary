computer - driven cars have been testing their skills on @entity3 roads for more than four years — but until now , the @entity4 was n't sure just how many were rolling around			1
now , the state has issued the first permits			2
the tough new rules mean @entity8 has also been forced to adapt its driverless car concept , adding a steering wheel			1
the tough new rules mean @entity8 has also been forced to adapt its driverless car concept , adding a steering wheel to allow it to be used on @entity3 roads the temporary wheel @entity8 has fitted to the car @entity8 's souped - up @entity14 are the biggest fleet , with 25 vehicles			1
@entity17 and @entity18 have two vehicles each , said @entity20 , the @entity4 official overseeing the state 's ' autonomous vehicle ' regulation - writing process			2
a ' handful ' of other companies are applying for permits , he said			2
' we knew that @entity3 law would require any vehicles still being tested to have manual controls , so we ’ve had a plan read , ' the firm said			0
' after each vehicle is assembled , we fit a temporary steering wheel and set of controls into it			2
' we ’ll remove these manual controls after the prototypes have finished being tested and permitted , because our vehicles are ultimately designed to operate without a human driver			0
' @entity8 also revealed it plans to use the vast aircraft hanger is leased from @entity43 as a test facility			1
testing of cars without drivers could begin at early next year , according to a statement from @entity50 associate director @entity49			1
@entity43 is working with @entity8 on the project and hopes to gain useful information for its own efforts to develop unmanned drones and systems			1
the agency issued testing permits that allowed three companies to dispatch 29 vehicles onto freeways and into neighborhoods — with a human behind the wheel in case the onboard computers make a bad decision			1
for the first time , @entity3 's @entity4 knows how many self - driving cars are traveling on the state 's public roads			1
these may be the cars of the future , but for now they represent a tiny fraction of @entity3 's approximately 32 million registered vehicles			1
@entity8 's souped - up @entity14 are the biggest fleet , with 25 vehicles			1
@entity17 and @entity18 have two vehicles each , said @entity20 , the @entity4 official overseeing the state 's ' autonomous vehicle ' regulation - writing process			2
a ' handful ' of other companies are applying for permits , he said			2
the permits formally regulate testing that already was underway			2
@entity8 alone is closing in on 1 million miles			0
the technology giant has bet heavily on the vehicles , which navigate using sophisticated sensors and detailed maps			0
@entity8 will work with @entity43 to test the cars at the @entity50 researcher center , where it recently leased this hangar from the space agency			1
@entity96 was built in 1933 to house @entity98 blimps after @entity99 , including @entity100 , pictured			0
finally , government rules are catching up			0
in 2012 , the @entity102 directed the @entity4 to regulate the emerging technology			0
rules that the agency first proposed in january went into effect tuesday			0
among them : — test drivers must have a sparkling driving record , complete a training regimen and enroll in a program that informs their employer if they get in an accident or are busted for driving under the influence off hours			0
— companies must carry $ 5 million of insurance for each vehicle and report to the state how many times their vehicles unexpectedly disengage from self - driving mode , whether due to a failure of the technology or because the human driver takes over in an emergency			0
a @entity8 self - driving car goes on a test drive near the @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity3 @entity3 passed its law after @entity131 and @entity132 and before @entity133			1
the federal government has not acted , and national regulations appear to be years away			0
it 's impossible to know the total number of self - driving cars being tested on public roads because , unlike @entity3 and @entity131 , @entity133 does not require special permits to test self - driving cars on public roads			1
@entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 are ' all running around here with some form of autonomous vehicle , ' said @entity150 , assistant administrator for the @entity151 , which registers motor vehicles			0
carmakers do not need a permit — manufacturer 's license plates are enough , and those plates can also be used on future models or other kinds of experimental cars			0
@entity131 has issued several test vehicle licenses to @entity8 , @entity18 and the auto supplier @entity162 , according to its @entity4			1
in @entity132 , only @entity163 has tested self - driving technology and it is not ongoing , according to a spokesman for the state 's motor vehicles department			0
with @entity3 's testing rules in effect , the @entity4 is drafting regulations that will govern self - driving cars once they are ready for the general public			2
those rules , which the @entity4 must finish by year 's end , will untie knotty issues such as whether a person needs to be in the vehicle at all			0

@entity182 issued testing permits that allowed three companies to dispatch 29 vehicles onto freeways and into neighborhoods
@entity8 has fitted a temporary wheel to its driverless car concept to allow it to take to the roads
