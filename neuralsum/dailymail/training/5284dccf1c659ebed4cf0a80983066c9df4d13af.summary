the original : @entity18 made headlines as ' @entity18 ' during the 2008 presidential campaign " it is really pathetic that the @entity5 campaign is more worried about what some intern in the basement of the @entity9 is tweeting rather than talking about the real issues facing @entity17 , ’ ms @entity89 said before further bashing ms @entity5			1

the @entity9 has drawn the ire of @entity5 supporters before , @entity107 noted			0
