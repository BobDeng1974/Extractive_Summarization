by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:33 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:48 est , 31 december 2013 half a century after @entity3 first drew her in a blue tunic and a plaid , buckled coat , the woman in a fashion sketch for the @entity10 still seems ready to saunter off the page and into the street			2
other women in sketches along the same wall at @entity16 are drawn in outfits just as chic , but the one by @entity3 stands out in a crowd — much as the meticulously groomed head designer and creative director for @entity20 does himself			2
' there 's attitude in her , ' said @entity26 , auctioneer and co-owner of the @entity30 auction house			2
autographed : one of @entity3 's few signed drawings from his time at @entity33 in the 60s hangs at the @entity36 house in @entity30			1
most in - house designers are not allowed to sign their work @entity26 hopes that attitude and the @entity3 signature attracts buyers to a jan. 11 auction of an archive of sketches for @entity33 designs			1
fashion legend : @entity3 , 80 , pictured in @entity48 in november , has been the creative head of @entity20 since 1983 in the 1960s , the @entity49 - based @entity33 designed movie costumes and clothing for @entity52 and other celebrities			1
it also was one of the @entity56 fashion houses where @entity3 freelanced , early in his career as a designer			0
@entity3 built his fashion legend through tenures at @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity20 and his own eponymous brands			0
and the @entity65 - born designer is recognized worldwide for his white ponytail , black sunglasses and black - and - white attire that includes high , starched collars			0
he also has branched out into photography and film directing and has published a unique diet book after shedding more than 90 pounds to fit into clothes cut for younger , slimmer male models			0
at @entity33 , though , he was a hired hand , a young ready - to - wear designer among dozens of others doing similar work for bigger houses			0
the details @entity3 added to sketches for @entity52 and other models — earrings , a flowing hem , a jacket 's trim or a specific shade of eye shadow — show the creativity of a young designer making his mark			1
' he finished off the fit , ' @entity26 said			0
the sketches more than illustrate a designer 's vision for an outfit			0
they 're really blueprints used to communicate specific information to the team that produces each outfit — from the designer to the patternmaker , fabric buyers , salespeople and other staff			0
@entity106 styles : several of the @entity3 drawings for @entity33 that will be auctioned on january 11 a-list clients : a glimpse of the drawings that @entity3 did for @entity52 the @entity33 archive , which includes more than 300 drawings , highlights the shift in fashion from haute couture worn only by wealthy women to ready - to - wear designs that could be produced in large quantities at lower prices			1
@entity33 's founder , @entity121 , kept @entity3 's designs and sketchbooks together with other work produced for the fashion house in the 1960s , and the archive was maintained by subsequent owners			1
along with memorabilia between @entity131 and @entity52 , @entity3 's work is the highlight of the auction			1
the sketch ... and the finished gown : how @entity3 's drawings were realized by @entity33 's studio dressing an icon : sketches of garments designed for @entity52 are displayed alongside her photograph ' these are more works of art. i do n't think people put that much effort into the sketches of today , ' said @entity148 , who designed for @entity149 for 17 years and now designs for private clients			1
much in the way @entity3 has kept @entity20 current by updating recognizable elements of the historic @entity155 label — patent leather , quilting , its signature chain — he put his own twist on the over- - the - top looks favored at @entity161 , @entity148 said			2
' his sketches are much younger - looking than whoever else was sketching at the time , much freer , ' said @entity148 , who has reviewed the @entity33 archive			0
unique archive : @entity166 says the sketches were ' not meant to be art , but as 50 years have gone by , [ they have ] become art because [ they were ] done by @entity3 ' fashion history : @entity33 's founder , @entity121 , kept @entity3 's sketchbooks together with other work produced for the house in the 1960s , and the archive was maintained by subsequent owners @entity26 said he could n't estimate the value of the unique archive as a whole , but bidding on the sketches likely will start at $ 500 each			1
' it was not meant to be art , but as 50 years have gone by , it has become art because it was done by @entity3 , ' @entity26 said .			0

sketches from @entity3 's time at @entity49 - based @entity189 have gone up for auction in @entity30 , @entity191
