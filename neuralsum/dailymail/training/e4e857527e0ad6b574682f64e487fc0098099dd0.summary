by @entity0 preacher : sheikh @entity2 is broadcasting inflammatory sermons from a small village residents of a wealthy village in @entity7 fear their community could become involved in a global conflict between different @entity11 sects after a hate preacher was given permission to broadcast his sermons from a former church			1
sheikh @entity2 spent £ 2million buying a disused hall in @entity17 and turning it into a mosque which is also the base for his controversial satellite tv channel			1
last week , @entity21 revealed it was powerless to stop the cleric 's incendiary broadcasts , which are said to stir up conflict between @entity26 sect and rival @entity27			1
now locals in the small village - favoured by celebrities such as @entity32 and @entity33 - are concerned that @entity17 will become the unlikely setting for a vicious war of words between the two sects			2
the @entity39 preacher , who has previously been jailed in @entity39 for insulting the faith of @entity27 , bought the former evangelical church last year and converted into a mosque and broadcasting centre			2
his channel , @entity44 , is registered by @entity21 - but most of its broadcasts can not be controlled by the regulator because they are only shown outside the @entity48			2
among the controversial sermons @entity2 has delivered over the airwaves was a celebration of the death of one of @entity27 's most revered figures			1
two years ago , @entity21 investigated the preacher after it emerged that he had suggested one of the @entity58 's successors was gay			2
and in another slur directed at a figure beloved by @entity27 , he referred to @entity58 's wife @entity61 as an ' enemy of @entity63 '			2
sleepy : but @entity17 in @entity7 is now the home of @entity2 's mosque and tv station pub : local residents say they are concerned about the impact of @entity2 on the @entity17 community residents of @entity17 , where the average home is worth nearly £ 1million , reacted with dismay to the news that @entity76 would be allowed to continue broadcasting hate speech			1
' we have no objection to any religious group being there as long as they fit in with this community , ' @entity78 , 84 , told @entity83 ' does any community want to be the source of vitriolic and poisonous output ? ' what half of us fear is a load of angry @entity27 from @entity90 coming here and having a rumble			1
' another local added : ' i have @entity11 friends who are so angry that lot can get away with spreading their bile			0
' building : the preacher 's mosque is located in an unassuming one - storey building behind a set of gates mosque : the sign advertising @entity2 's mosque , located on the site of a former evangelical church the village of @entity17 , located in @entity7 just outside the @entity108 , apparently has its origins in @entity111 times - its name means ' lake of birds ' in @entity115			1
long before the arrival of @entity2 's mosque last year , the first religious establishment in the village was @entity121 's church , built during the reign of @entity123 later in the 17th century , the family which owned the manor of @entity17 became so poor that they had to sell their home to their own servants because they could no longer afford to keep it			1
however , later residents were much less hard - up - the village 's position between @entity135 and the countryside has made it a magnet for celebrities and the super-rich , and the average house there is now worth nearly £ 1million			1
among the well - known figures who own properties in the area are tv presenters @entity32 and @entity148 , heavy metal legend @entity33 and @entity152 actors @entity150 and @entity153			0
as well as the 17th - century @entity155 pub , one of the village 's principal attractions is the cricket club , whose clubhouse was opened by local boy @entity160			0
the village is situated in an idyllic cluster of @entity164 towns which are frequently used to film @entity165 , while it is also close to @entity167 where quintessentially @entity48 films such as the @entity171 and @entity168 series were produced			0
last week , @entity173 mp @entity172 described @entity2 's rhetoric as ' 10 times worse ' than @entity176 's novel @entity177 , which drew death threats from @entity11 extremists			0
he added : ‘ if somebody was being anti-semitic , we would take action			0
if somebody was being racist we would take action - even if it was an @entity186 person having a go at a black person			0
and it ’s quite right to do that			0
‘ because this is seen as intra-faith , nobody seems to be bothered			0
it is already causing problems in the @entity195 and the @entity196			0
it will start to bubble up here as well			0
’ stirring up hatred against @entity27 could potentially be a breach of the @entity201 , although it is not know whether police have ever investigated @entity2			1
the rivalry between @entity27 - who include up to 90 per cent of the world 's @entity27 - and the minority @entity206 lies behind many of the world 's most vicious conflicts , including the insurgency in @entity211			1
@entity17 , a village of fewer than 500 people , is in the commuter belt just outside the @entity108 , and is inhabited by rich families who value the rural atmosphere and proximity to @entity135 .			0

sheikh @entity2 bought £ 2million base in @entity17 last year
@entity21 has now *confirmed* he is allowed to broadcast hate - filled sermons stirring up *enmity* between @entity27 and @entity206
now residents of the @entity165 - style village are worried about the community 's *reputation*
' we do *n't* want to be the source of vitriolic and poisonous output '
