a man told yesterday how he was molested as an 11 - year - old by @entity2 in a bedroom at the @entity4			1
the paedophile mp took the schoolboy from his @entity8 constituency to @entity9 and introduced him to @entity11 leader @entity10 at @entity12			1
hours later , 29stone @entity2 sexually assaulted the boy at the club which housed the party ’s headquarters			1
abuser : @entity2 with @entity19 leaders @entity20 ( left ) and @entity10			1
a man has alleged he was introduced to mr @entity23 after he was taken to @entity9 by the paedophile mp @entity25 , the mp who helped expose the serial abuser , said the @entity27 can no longer resist the call for an inquiry into the scandal			1
he said the latest shocking revelations took it right to the heart of the @entity11 and proved @entity2 was abusing boys ‘ right under their noses ’			2
the schoolboy ’s sordid encounter with @entity2 took place in 1978 after his mother spotted a story in the @entity43 newspaper			1
it said the mp had been invited to nominate a @entity8 boy from a one - parent family for a free place at public school			1
she contacted @entity2 and was told it was @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , founded in 1813 as a boarding school for children who had lost one or both parents			2
after visiting the family , @entity2 took the 11 - year - old by train to the capital			2
@entity2 ’s victim , who is now 47 and does n’t want to be identified , said : ‘ he sat next to me on the train			1
i remember he ate a massive breakfast of fried eggs and bacon			2
’ the victim , now 49 , was taken to the @entity4 where , upstairs , he claims he was sexually assaulted the mp first took the schoolboy to the houses of @entity69 where he met @entity22 – now @entity70 – steel			1
the victim recalls little of the meeting save for a brief introduction but said : ‘ i remember telling all my friends at the time that i had met the leader of the @entity11 – it was something to brag about			1
’ in the afternoon he travelled to @entity53 to tour the school whose former pupils include @entity80 and where current boarding fees range from £ 22,000 to £ 27,000 a year			2
on returning to @entity9 he and @entity2 arrived at the @entity4 near @entity69			1
the @entity11 hq was based in offices in the building and it also provided accommodation for members			2
@entity2 had arranged for himself and the boy to share a bedroom that night			2
his victim said : ‘ i was sitting on the side of the bed			2
i had the sense at that point that i wanted to keep my vest and pants on			2
‘ he was kneeling down in front of me and asking me to take them off			0
then he insisted i take my underpants off and he attempted to fondle me			0
i then went sort of “ whoa ” and raised my hands			0
he backed away and that was it			0
he stood up and moved away and i went to sleep			0
i think we slept in the same bed but i am not sure			0
i was an 11 - year - old child			0
it felt a bit weird and then it felt like it was really wrong			0
’ now a father of two , living and working in @entity9 , he added : ‘ i think i was very , very lucky			1
it was a very close escape , i know			0
’ returning home he did n’t tell his mother what had happened but says now the incident had a profound impact			0
he said : ‘ i was a happy 11 - year - old doing well at school but from the age of 11 to 25 , 14 years , it was just a wasteland			1
’ @entity2 was ‘ disappointed ’ when told the boy had decided not to take up the @entity51 offer			0
the victim finally told his mother what had happened some ten years later			2
‘ she was mortified , ’ he said			0
his mother added : ‘ i was terribly anguished and have been since			0
but @entity2 was extraordinarily plausible			0
’ her son said : ‘ if my small story can encourage other people to get in touch and flesh out the real truth here and prompt a public inquiry , then so be it			0
’ he said he had decided against contacting the police , but added : ‘ i would not be against talking to the police if necessary			0
’ @entity2 , knighted in 1988 , was the mp for @entity8 for two decades from 1972 for the @entity11 and then the @entity27			1
he died , aged 82 , in 2010			0
' shocking ' : @entity25 , who helped expose the serial abuser , said the @entity27 can not resist an inquiry mr @entity25 , @entity135 mp for @entity8 whose book @entity136 : the @entity138 of @entity2 was serialised in the @entity139 , said : ‘ @entity140 after shocking revelation has emerged about the abuse meted out to young boys by one of their most senior mps and yet the @entity27 are doing absolutely nothing to inquire into it			1
‘ just how long does @entity147 think he can resist the public demand for answers from his party ? here we have @entity10 , who is in denial over @entity2 , being introduced to a potential victim just hours before @entity2 attempts to sexually molest him in the @entity4 – right at the heart of the party			1
‘ surely senior figures at the club that night must have wondered why a young boy was sleeping in the same room as @entity2			0
’ @entity10 has threatened to sue the @entity139 over criticism of the @entity11 leadership ’s handling of the @entity2 affair			1
a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 ’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined			0
his actions were not known to or condoned by the @entity11 or the @entity27			0
@entity10 has no recollection of this			1
