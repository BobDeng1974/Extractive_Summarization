by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 18 april 2013 screening older people for early dementia when they visit their gp could do more harm than good , a leading expert has warned			2
dr @entity6 said the plans were ‘ a disaster in slow motion ’ because people without symptoms could be wrongly diagnosed and have their lives thrown into turmoil			1
he believes patients with minor memory problems could drain the @entity16 of vital resources needed for those who have conditions such as @entity20 ’s			1
around one in three older people will develop some form of cognitive impairment or memory problem – which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full - blown dementia			1
warning : screening older people for early dementia when they visit their gp could do more harm than good , a leading expert has warned ( file picture ) health secretary @entity31 thinks doctors are refusing to carry out tests because there is no effective cure available			1
he is pushing for @entity36 to screen people for signs of dementia even if they do not have obvious symptoms			2
but dr @entity6 , an old - age psychiatry specialist at the @entity43 , has raised concerns about the impact the tests will have on patients			1
he said : ‘ routine screening means that people will be diagnosed long before they start to show symptoms			2
a diagnosis can turn someone ’s life upside down years before dementia itself does			2
‘ on a personal level , just knowing that you have this illness coming will lead to all sorts of problems – from profound anxiety and stress for the patient and their families , to a loss of independence , an impact on their career if they are still working and social isolation			1
' and all of this before symptoms are obvious			0
’ health secretary @entity31 thinks doctors are refusing to carry out tests because there is no effective cure available dr @entity6 predicted that vast sums of money would have to be diverted to people who will have a raised expectation of treatment and support at a time when the @entity16 is struggling to cope with those already diagnosed with dementia			1
he added : ‘ current tests are not particularly robust and there is a relatively high risk of misdiagnosis so all of this turmoil could be even more unnecessary			1
‘ it is unfair to cause fear and concern when treatments are not available , the chances of the condition actually progressing are not clear , and when symptoms may never take hold in the patient ’s lifetime			0
‘ dementia is an undeniable concern for ageing societies , but the key is a more timely and swift diagnosis when symptoms become apparent – not routine screening			0
’ the @entity106 concluded in 2010 that screening for @entity20 ’s ‘ should not be offered ’ as it failed to find evidence that it would be beneficial			0
a spokesman for the @entity110 said : ‘ we agree with the @entity106 that there is no justification for screening the whole population for @entity20 ’s			0
’ however , @entity115 , from the @entity116 , said : ‘ population screening is inappropriate , but asking older people at high risk about their memory is vital			0
' suggesting people are kept in the dark is a retrograde step			0
the medical profession must not bury its head in the sand over tackling the condition			0
