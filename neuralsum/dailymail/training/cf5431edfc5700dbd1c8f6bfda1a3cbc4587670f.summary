by @entity0 a hotel price - fixing scam that led to guests being overcharged for rooms on ‘ discount ’ websites has been brought to an end following an investigation by the consumer watchdog			1
the @entity9 probe found some hotel chains had joined forces with booking sites , meaning the ‘ cheap ’ rates offered online were really the same as the normal price			1
as a result , people shopping around for cut - price rooms on the internet have been wasting their time			0
agreements : @entity21 was one of the websites involved in the discount capping deals with hotel chains the @entity9 probe looked at the activities of the @entity28 , plus @entity29 and @entity21			1
both sites entered into agreements with the chain that restricted their ability to discount the rate for room - only hotel bookings			0
the ‘ sweetheart ’ deals have now been blocked by the @entity9			1
all three companies have signed a legally - binding agreement to end the price - fixing regime , to avoid legal action			1
it is hoped the move will bring about a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in rates			0
but some industry insiders believe the new regime will make little difference			0
this is because the agreement contains several small - print clauses which mean travellers will have to jump through hoops to make sure they get access to the best discounts			1
families will have to sign up to a membership scheme of the online travel agent ( @entity59 ) or hotel to be able to view specific discounts			1
before people can book any discount deal they must first have made at least one undiscounted booking with the agent or hotel			0
the discounts offered by @entity67 will be funded through their commission or margins			2
@entity29 : the @entity9 found hotel chains and travel websites had been capping discounts so people shopping around for cheap rooms have been wasting their time because websites and hotels charge the same @entity79 ' anger over rip - off holiday prices has been boiling over in recent days			1
eariler this week one man 's rant about the hike in the cost of @entity86 holidays during school holidays was shared 143,000 times in @entity89			0
but while officials can do little about companies choosing to raise prices to make the most of spikes in demand , the sweetheart deals between hotel chains and online resellers could have fallen foul of the @entity99			2
the @entity9 investigation into the issue was triggered four years ago by @entity107 businessman , @entity100 , the founder of the discount rooms website @entity102 , who complained rivals tried to put him out of business because he undercut their prices			1
he said : ‘ we started getting some calls from angry and confused hoteliers insisting that we were selling their rooms too cheaply			0
‘ i realised a website had been on to them threatening all sorts of nonsense if they did n’t either remove their hotel from @entity120 or force @entity120 to raise its prices			0
’ he added : ‘ i had hotels calling me and emailing me to raise my prices			2
i found out that other hotel booking websites were then also tipping off the hotels about my prices			1
‘ soon i found the wholesalers who provided me with rooms stopped working with me			2
i would say that i lost about 70 per cent of my business			0
’ the @entity131 in @entity132 : @entity29 and @entity21 each entered into separate agreements with the chain which restricted their ability to discount the rate at which room bookings were offered mr @entity100 , feels the changes announced by the @entity9 do not go far enough			1
the @entity140 authorities are about to outlaw any price agreements between hotels and travel agents			2
he warned the deal signed by the hotel groups and travel agents only runs for two years			0
‘ i really ca n’t see these proposals will offer any meaningful savings			0
we should just have a free market in hotel rooms where prices are clear , ’ he said			0
@entity9 senior director , @entity153 , insisted that consumers will see benefits			1
‘ the travel industry , fuelled by the internet , has seen significant changes in recent years , and we want to ensure those changes continue to work in consumers ’ interests , ’ she said			0
‘ that is why we are pleased to have secured this outcome which , by allowing @entity67 and hotels to offer discounts , should increase competition and mean travellers across @entity169 can benefit from reductions on hotel accommodation throughout the @entity172			2
‘ by shopping around , people can compare the different discounts offered by hotels and @entity67 , and ensure they get the best deal			2

hotels and websites had agreed to cap discounts , @entity9 found
companies involved sign binding agreement to end the practice
