in a sickening lecture to the crew of lawyers and victim 's family members who were in the @entity8 court , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 attacks said the @entity10 government had killed many more people in the name of national security than he is accused of killing			1
@entity14 addressed the court on wednesday during a pretrial hearing where he placed blame on the @entity10 government rather than accepting any ounce of guilt following his role in the terrorist attacks that killed 2,976 people			1
' when the government feels sad for the death or the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on september 11 , we also should feel sorry that the @entity10 government that was represented by ( the chief prosecutor ) and others have killed thousands of people , millions , ' said @entity14 , who wore a military - style camouflage vest to the courtroom			1
his lawyers said previously that @entity14 considers himself a prisoner of war and wanted to wear clothing similar to what he wore as a mujahedeen fighter			1
the prison commander had previously forbidden it , but that was overturned by the judge , sparking outrage from victims families who saw the move as a way for him to send a message to fellow extremists			2
he accused the @entity10 of using an elastic definition of national security , comparable to the way dictators bend the law to justify their acts			0
' many can kill people under the name of national security , and to torture people under the name of national security , and to detain children under the name of national security , underage children , ' he said in @entity82 through an @entity84 interpreter			0
' the president can take someone and throw him into the sea under the name of national security and so he can also legislate the assassinations under the name of national security for the @entity10 citizens , ' he said in an apparent reference to the @entity10 killing and burial at sea of @entity97 leader @entity96 and the @entity10 use of drone strikes against @entity10 citizens accused of conspiring with @entity97			0
he advised the court against ' getting affected by the crocodile tears ' and said , ' your blood is not made out of gold and ours is made out of water			0
we are all human beings			0
' on trial : @entity14 boycotted the pretrial hearings and the judge ruled that the defendants can wear camouflage gear if they want to during the formal trial mastermind : @entity14 has previously claimed responsibility for the attacks on the @entity118 and the @entity119 that resulted in thousands of deaths the judge , army colonel @entity121 , gave @entity14 permission to speak and did not interrupt him , but said he would not hear any further personal comments from the defendants			1
@entity14 's lecture to the court came during a week of pretrial hearings at the @entity128 in @entity129 for him and four other captives accused of recruiting , funding and training the hijackers			1
under the @entity138 , one of the things that separate soldiers from unlawful belligerents is the wearing of uniforms that distinguish them from civilians			2
soldiers must also follow a clear command structure , carry arms openly and adhere to the laws of war			0
@entity14 's defense attorney , @entity147 captain @entity146 had argued that forbidding @entity14 from wearing military - style garb could undermine his presumption of innocence in the war crimes tribunal			1
‘ they are trying to use their situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts @entity10 troops in danger , ’ said @entity152 , the sister of one of the pilots who died on september 11			1
‘ if these defendants were members of the @entity163 and they were on trial for killing a black family , for burning their house , would they be allowed to wear their klan uniforms in court to show their solidarity with their fellow @entity163 members ? absolutely not ! ' she told @entity171			0
hurt : @entity152 , the sister of one of the pilots whose plane was hijacked in the 9/11 attacks , calls the leniency on the dress code issue a way for the terror suspects to promote their cause @entity14 and one other defendant attended the pretrial motions hearing for the military tribunal			1
three defendants chose to stay in their cells			0
the five are charged with planning and aiding the worst terrorist attack on @entity10 soil			0
the vest worn by @entity14 is one popular among hunters , but also has a seasonal appeal to many right now as company spokesman @entity194 told @entity171 that it is particularly popular as a part of military - inspired @entity197 costumes			1
with many camouflage patterns differing from type to type , the style that the 9/11 mastermind sported is thought to be the company 's vintage camouflage range			1
mr @entity194 was quick to point out that the ' vintage ' label applies to the type of aesthetic wash that was used in its making , and not an implication that it was ever previously used as part of an @entity10 military uniform			0
the suggested list price for such a vest , which uses a camouflage style called ' woodland ' , is $ 52.49			1
@entity45 , established in @entity216 in 1953 , has previously held military contracts , but they do not hold any currently			0
' we certainly are n't happy that he 's chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way @entity221 would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court , ' mr @entity194 said			2
the only stipulation that the judge , @entity147 col. @entity121 , made regarding the dress code for the five defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be @entity10 military uniforms			2
that said , the @entity234 reports that the camouflage hunting vest used by @entity14 and his fellow detainee was made by @entity45 , an @entity10 company that produces hunting and military gear			1
a spokesman for @entity45 , the military and survivalist clothing supplier , confirmed that they were not aware that their vest was going to be the one that helped @entity14 make his symbolic statement in court on wednesday			1
' we certainly are n't happy that he 's chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way @entity221 would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court , ' said @entity194 , director of the company 's sales and marketing divisions			2
the selection of a @entity45 vest was in keeping with the judge 's specification that the camouflage worn by the defendent not be a part of any @entity10 military uniform , as the company does not have any current contracts with the armed forces and does not supply any of their standard - issue uniforms			2
that said , the vest is a common item , as mr @entity194 told @entity171 that it could be found in any @entity49 store			2
@entity14 's lawyer made a formal request to the judge asking to allow the camouflage because that is what @entity14 wore when he was part of the mujahedeen militia that fought to overthrow the @entity280			1
‘ these men are guilty of war crimes - you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause , ’ mrs @entity152 said			0
poor conditions : the detainees ' defence lawyers say the environment in the office assigned to them at @entity8 ( pictured ) is making them ill court : monday 's hearing was more peaceful than previous proceedings have been ' i 'm sympathetic because he ’s under a microscope and he wants the proceedings to be fair and to be perceived as fair and legitimate , ’ explained ms @entity152 , who is a former attorney , ‘ but he does n’t have to take it when defence council and the defendants go over the line			2
’ ‘ it is the judge ’s job to insure a fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist statements from inside an @entity10 military courtroom			0
‘ they are speaking to @entity311 members of @entity97 and those who would be ripe for recruitment for their cause			0
they want to portray themselves as soldiers of @entity317			0
’ @entity14 and his four co-defendants face charges that include terrorism , conspiracy and 2,976 counts of murder in violation of the law of war , one count for each known victim of the september 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed			1
they could get the death penalty if convicted			0
video : lawyers for the accused say they are n't able to speak with their client ...			0
