by @entity0 it seems that @entity3 's recent ' belfie ' photo has sent women into a frenzy			1
perhaps in a desperate bid to emulate the reality tv star , women have been rushing to @entity9 at @entity9 to snap up their new ' @entity10 ' , which contain hidden pads high on the buttocks to make them appear fuller and more peachy			1
sales have risen 4,600 per cent online and 917 per cent in store this week - with size small briefs selling out in a matter of hours			1
but do they really give you a voluptuous bottom a la @entity22 ? peachy : this is how @entity9 show you 're bottom could look before wearing the pants , left , and after putting them on , right @entity27 : without the £ 6 @entity10 , left , and with them , right @entity28 , 24 , from took the pants for a spin around the streets of @entity32			1
speaking about the briefs , she said : ' i have quite a big bum anyway so they do n't really make that much of a difference			1
' i imagine if you were a girl with one of those flat bottoms , they would really help			2
' the good thing is , they feel exactly like normal pants but i would never wear them - imagine if someone groped your bum and felt all that padding ... how mortifying ! '			2
@entity50 asked a few passers by for their opinion on @entity28 's pert new derriere			2
@entity54 , 25 , said : ' i can definitely tell you 're wearing some sort of padding under there			2
if they were more discreet then they 'd be a welcome addition in my wardrobe			0
' @entity63 , 44 , said : ' two thumbs up from me , cracking ! '			0
@entity65 , 32 , added : ' you 're @entity67 ( visible panty line ) is pretty obvious but your bum looks nice and squeezable - i 'd beware if i were you ! '			0
before and after : @entity28 tests out the new @entity9 pants and while the may be comfy , she would n't wear them out spot the difference : @entity72 ( left ) and wearing the @entity9 knickers ( right ) @entity9 unveiled the £ 6 pants on the back of research which revealed that 64 per cent of the nation 's ladies wanted help in enhancing their curves			1
the study found that 52 per cent admitted to being unhappy about the size and shape of their bottoms and 74 per cent admitted to wearing a padded bra on a daily basis			0
a spokesperson for @entity9 said : ' at this time of year many women are after a show - stopping outfit and with the trend for slimline dresses still going strong as we head into @entity95 women are looking to their under garments to help create the illusion of the perfect silhouette			0
' this year there has been a lot of demand for product that not just " sucks you in " but also " pads you out " - it 's not about losing inches anymore , but more about creating an amazing curvy and feminine shape			1
' @entity108 : small bums were once all the rage , but singers like @entity22 are now admired for their curves @entity113 : @entity114 tv star @entity3 , pictured , was also named among the top five celebrity bottoms it is not the first time @entity9 has tried to cash in on the bum - enhancing craze			0
the supermarket said its @entity120 became the best selling pair of jeans in its history , shifting 600 pairs in the first five hours of sale			0
there are already several pairs of padded pants on the market , with @entity133 booty boosting shorts getting the biggest thumbs - up from our @entity50 writers earlier this year			0
but at £ 72 a pop , they wo n't leave much change in the back pocket to do the ' @entity9 price ' spank .			1
