as the @entity2 clock ticked over into the 89th minute , the booming @entity0 kicked in and proclaimed that @entity3 was @entity4 's man of the match			1
sometimes the sponsors ' choice is met with bewilderment , even derision			0
the reaction was warm applause from all four corners of the stadium - universal acknowledgement and appreciation			0
@entity3 had been excellent , by some distance the stand - out player			1
direct and deadly , this was @entity3 at his game - changing best			2
who needs @entity21 ? @entity3 leads the celebrations after putting @entity4 2 - 0 ahead against @entity23 on friday @entity3 's header deflects into the back of the net to send @entity4 into a commanding lead @entity3 is congratulated by @entity4 captain @entity28 after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign @entity3 's pitch map from the @entity23 match shows his influence right across the front line @entity3 has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for @entity37 this season but has six in four qualifiers for @entity4			1
on a productive night , @entity3 blasted in the shot that led to @entity28 's opener , stooped to divert home @entity4 's second , had three other shots on goal and tormented the @entity46 defence with his pace , power and passing			1
the goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with @entity52 - and he duly became the leading scorer in @entity55 qualifying with six goals , one ahead of @entity58 's @entity57			1
@entity3 's touch map showed his influence right across the field , switching places with @entity28 and @entity63 in a dynamic front three that linked up seamlessly throughout			2
the only dampener on the evening was the knee injury that will force him out of tuesday night 's friendly with @entity67 in @entity68			0
which all begs the question - why does n't @entity3 play like this for @entity37 ? @entity3 caused the @entity46 defence problems all evening and justified his selection @entity3 ran directly at the @entity46 defence all evening in a positive performance @entity3 is congratulated by former @entity74 team - mate @entity28 after doubling the lead @entity3 's touch map from the match with @entity23 shows his presence right across the attack pushed out to the wing to accommodate the in - form @entity81 , @entity3 has all - too - often looked a spare part in @entity37 colours this season following his Â£ 16m move from @entity74 last september			1
the fact his @entity4 goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps @entity91 should ask @entity92 for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman			1
because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with @entity37 , the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub , inhibiting his performance			1
with @entity4 it somehow plays to his strengths			2
with the @entity4 on his chest , @entity3 is content and confident , raising his game to a level rarely seen for the @entity106			1
there he can be aloof , slow and ineffective			0
the memes that often go viral on @entity109 portraying @entity3 as a @entity111 winner or with the @entity112 are very much tongue - in - cheek but he can rise above the mockery			2
at the moment , @entity3 is unlikely to displace @entity81 , who has 17 goals in 26 games this season , but friday night 's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks			1
@entity91 should liberate him and say ' you 're playing wide for the foreseeable future , but make it your own			0
get the head down , get the legs pumping			0
when you run at opposition defences , it is a frightening proposition			0
inevitably , positive play will lead to more goals			0
and more goals will lead to a sustained title challenge			0
' @entity3 has often cut a frustrated figure playing wide for @entity37 this season one of the memes on social media portraying @entity3 as a @entity111 winner with @entity4 the @entity37 man holds the @entity112 for best player in the world in another viral image another meme had @entity143 star @entity142 lifting his shirt to reveal a t - shirt of @entity3 's face @entity37 manager @entity91 has pushed @entity3 out to the wings to accommodate @entity81 @entity3 is the first to congratulate debutant @entity21 after scoring two minutes after coming on @entity3 celebrates with @entity28 after he turns home the rebound after the @entity37 striker 's effort was saved @entity3 's goals have put @entity4 in firm control of their @entity55 qualifying group sure , it was only @entity23 but @entity3 does n't select the opposition			1
he delivered against @entity157 and @entity158 too earlier in the qualifying campaign			0
with goals comes the confidence to deliver against the top teams as well , in the @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity55 when it rolls around			2
we now have the blueprint			0
let 's hope we see @entity3 deliver .			0

@entity4 beat @entity23 4 - 0 in a @entity55 qualifier at @entity2 on friday
@entity3 had a hand in the first goal and scored the second
he was named man of the match after a positive and confident display
@entity3 is the top *goalscorer* in @entity55 qualifying with six
@entity92 has got the best out of a player often sluggish for @entity37
now @entity91 must allow @entity3 to run directly at defences
