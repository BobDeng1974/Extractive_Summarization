by @entity0 imagine every time a plane completed a flight , the entire aircraft was scrapped and another built for the next journey			0
that 's the problem facing modern space travel			1
each time a rocket is launched almost the entire structure is thrown away , often at the cost of hundreds of millions of pounds			2
@entity11 - based @entity10 are hoping to change this with its @entity13 ( @entity14 ) rocket , which is seen taking off and landing in the same spot in this video			1
the rocket ' hopped ' to a height of 3,280ft ( 1km ) before beginning its descent			1
it is the first time @entity10 has used stabilising ' grid fins ' - the mesh - like struts at the bottom - to stabilise the descent of the rocket in the clip , released yesterday by @entity10 , the firm performs a test flight of its reusable rocket at its development facility in @entity36 , @entity37			1
@entity10 ceo @entity38 wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the planet , but admitted he ’d like to start small , with a group of 10 people , and build the colony from there			2
he ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket , fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane , to reach the red planet by 2026			1
it would need to be much heavier than @entity10 ’s current rockets , including the @entity51 that is currently in development and is expected to launch by the end of this year			1
' i 'm hopeful that the first people could be taken to @entity56 in 10 to 12 years , i think it 's certainly possible for that to occur , ' he told @entity59			0
' but the thing that matters long term is to have a self - sustaining city on @entity56 , to make life multi-planetary			0
' however , he is taking no unnecessary risks			0
he famously once said : ' i 'd like to die on @entity56 , just not on impact			0
' the rocket flies to 3,280ft ( 1km ) , remaining stable the entire time , before coming back to land on the ground			1
the test follows the successful completion of the @entity74 program last year , which saw @entity10 gradually increase the ceiling to which its reusable rockets jump			1
while for now the technology is only capable of these brief hops , it will eventually be used on fully - fledged launches			1
this will enable @entity10 to launch satellites into orbit and then bring most of the rocket that launched them there back to @entity87			1
this would be a level of reusablility not seen since the @entity91 , when @entity92 used to recover the two side boosters called @entity94 ( @entity95 ) from the ocean - in addition to the shuttle orbiters themselves being reusable			1
but @entity10 ’s plan would land the rocket straight back on the pad it took off from and it could be ready for another launch very rapidly			2
the @entity13 rocket is shown during take off			2
the test follows the successful completion of the @entity74 program last year			0
while for now the technology is only capable of these brief hops , it will eventually be used on fully - fledged launches in the latest experiments , @entity10 tested a set of steerable fins for the first time , called grid fins			1
these are seen as the mesh - like fins towards the bottom of the rocket in the video			2
@entity13 topped with @entity10 fairing is 224.4 feet ( 68.4 meters ) tall and 12 feet in diameter ( the fairing is 17 feet in diameter )			1
its nine first - stage @entity125 engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust at sea level , rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as @entity13 climbs out of the @entity87 ’s atmosphere			2
falcon 9 is named after the @entity133 starship in the @entity135 movies			0
the number 9 refers to the nine @entity125 engines that power falcon 9 ’s first stage ; one @entity125 vacuum engine powers the second stage			0
they deploy approximately one minute and 15 seconds into the flight and provide control of the rocket to fly it back to ground			2
the next steps for the rocket will be to launch to higher altitudes , proving the rocket can successfully land in more flight - like circumstances			0
and , ultimately , the final goal is to use it on a real launch and bring a rocket back to the ground - so far the technology has only been used by @entity10 to bring a rocket to a controlled landing in the ocean after launching to space			1
in an interview with @entity59 , @entity10 ceo @entity38 outlined the ultimate plans for @entity10 with regards to reusable rockets			1
' what we hope to achieve and can perhaps encourage industry to do is to have full reusability with rocketry , ' he said			0
' it 's never been done			0
you can imagine in any mode of transport if there was not reusability , like aircraft or cars , that there could be very little use of that			0
' @entity10 ceo @entity38 has grand plans for his space agency			2
with help from @entity92 he has grown the company significantly in a decade			0
it is now capable of taking cargo to the @entity189 with its @entity190 and @entity13 rocket and , beginning possibly in the next few years , the company will take humans into space private spaceflight company @entity10 successfully launched the first of its newly - improved @entity13 v1.1 rockets in september 2013 ( pictured )			1
the 22 - story rocket soared off a launch pad at @entity198 with 60 per cent stronger engines than its predecessor he went on to state that it would be ' revolutionary ' to ultimately be able to recover a rocket booster and then fly it			0
' now we have been trying to do that for 12 years and have n't yet succeeded , but i feel as though we are finally close to achieving it			0
' he added the firm hopes to recover a booster later this year with a view to re-flying it in 2015			0
' this would really mark a significant change in the technology of rocketry , ' he said			0
space x is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity87 so that they can be recovered and recycled			0
pictured is the @entity13 rocket , which will be adapted to use this reusable technology and land back on a launch pad in the future			1

@entity10 has completed a test of its reusable rocket in @entity36 , @entity37
called the @entity13 , it is hoped to reduce the cost of space travel
in the video , the rocket launches to a height of 3,280ft ( 1km )
it then brings itself down to a controlled landing on the ground
this technology will eventually be used for fully - fledged launches , which would allow @entity10 to use rockets on multiple *occasions*
