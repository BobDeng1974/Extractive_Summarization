by @entity0 in 2011 @entity1 was rocked by a magnitude 9 earthquake , the most powerful in the country ’s recorded history , which together with a tsunami killed more than 15,000 people and caused upwards of £ 20.2 billion in damage			1
but it seems the effects of the earthquake are not over yet , as the huge tremor may have disrupted @entity14 and placed it in a critical condition			1
the result could be an eruption that mimics the last in 1707 , which bathed vast swathes of @entity1 in ash and caused untold damage , at a time when the country was much less populated			1
@entity24 and @entity1 scientists say that @entity14 is at higher risk of eruption			1
its last major eruption was in 1707 , at a time when the country was much less populated			2
in the modern day , just 60 miles ( 100 kilometres ) south west of @entity32 ( pictured ) , an eruption could be catastrophic the research was carried out by scientists at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity24 and the @entity38 in @entity39 , working in collaboration with @entity1 scientists			1
at an elevation of 3,776 metres ( 12,388 feet ) , @entity14 is the highest mountain in @entity1			1
it is an active stratovolcano found on @entity45 that last erupted in december 1707			2
known as the @entity48 eruption , this is thought to have expelled a billion cubic metres of ash and debris			0
@entity14 lies 60 miles ( 100 kilometres ) south west of @entity32 , which in 1707 was called @entity51			1
on 22 june 2014 @entity14 was added to the @entity52 as a @entity53 , one of @entity1 ’s ‘ @entity55 ’			1
for the first time they observed the response of @entity1 volcanoes to seismic waves produced by the @entity62 earthquake of 2011			1
their conclusions , published in @entity65 , reveal how earthquakes can impact volcanoes and should help to assess the risk of massive volcanic eruptions worldwide			0
' our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting , but it does show that it 's in a critical state , ' dr @entity70 , lead author of the publication , told @entity76			0
after the giant @entity79 - oki earthquake of 2011 , the researchers analysed over 70 terabytes of seismic data from the network			1
for the first time , they showed that the regions where the perturbations of the @entity85 's crust were the greatest were not those where the shocks were the strongest			0
they were in fact localised under volcanic regions , especially under @entity14			2
the reason for this is likely due to fluids trapped under the volcano such as boiling water and liquid magma			0
‘ essentially the idea is that before this study we had very few methods to know the state of pressure of the volcano at depth , ’ dr @entity70 tells @entity98			2
‘ with this new method , we are able to get insights on how the interior of the volcano , the part between the magma chamber and the surface , is affected			0
‘ we think that these are important in the preparation of eruption			0
’ the new research shows how volcanoes can be affected , or induce , earthquakes			0
previous research suggests @entity14 , which is found on @entity45 , may be sitting on a active fault 19 miles ( 30 kilometres ) wide that could be capable of causing magnitude 7 earthquakes , possibly enough to cause an eruption the crustal seismic velocity drop induced by the @entity79 earthquake highlights a large anomaly below @entity14 volcano , as seen here in this 3d rendering released by the researchers the researchers found a high anomaly beneath the volcano , despite it being 310 miles ( 500 kilometres ) from the epicentre of the 2011 earthquake , suggesting pressure was building			1
however , dr @entity70 adds : ‘ it is not possible within our results to know when an eruption will occur or what size it will be			0
‘ we were just able to map the fact there is an anomaly in the partly pressurised region , so the volcanic risk in that region is higher			2
' ‘ i ca n’t tell about future eruptions , but what i can say is we are expecting a new earthquake rather close to @entity14			2
‘ within 100 kilometres a large earthquake is expected			0
‘ if there were this large earthquake close , again the risk would be very high of having an eruption			2
’ in 2011 @entity1 was rocked by a magnitude 9 earthquake named @entity161 , the most powerful in the country 's recorded history , which together with a tsunami killed more than 15,000 people and caused upwards of £ 20.2 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in damage the last time @entity14 erupted was on 16 december 1707 , and that eruption was preceded by the violent 8.7 - magnitude @entity48 earthquake 49 days before			1
it spread ash of varying levels across east @entity1 ( shown )			2
the researchers say no eruption is imminent at the moment , however the findings were made using 800 seismic sensors and recording fluctuations underground that can map geological disturbances			1
the new method thus enabled the scientists to observe the anomalies caused by the perturbations from the earthquake in volcanic regions under pressure			2
@entity14 , which exhibits the greatest anomaly , is probably under great pressure , although no eruption has yet followed the @entity79 earthquake			1
the last time @entity14 erupted was on 16 december 1707 , and that eruption was preceded by the violent 8.7 - magnitude @entity48 earthquake 49 days before			1
with regards to the 2011 earthquake on 11 march , it was followed by a 6.4 magnitude quake four days later			1
this confirmed the criticial state of @entity199 to the researchers			0
they add , however , that there is no need for evacuation or any other drastic measures in @entity1 yet , although caution must be taken			0
‘ all we can say is that @entity14 is now in a state of pressure , which means it displays a high potential for eruption , ’ dr @entity70 added to the @entity76			1
‘ the risk is clearly higher			0
’ the researchers showed for the first time that the regions where the perturbations of the @entity85 's crust were the greatest after the 2011 earthquake were not those where the shocks were the strongest , but under volcanic regions , especially under @entity14 ( pictured from space ) the ‘ critical ’ nature of the volcano comes from the state of the magma stored 3.1 miles ( five kilometres ) beneath the surface in the rock mass. ‘ this part of the crust is kind of critical in a sense that perturbation from seismic waves generated by an earthquake will generate quite significantly in the crust , ' dr @entity70 tells @entity98			1
‘ it is critical in fracturation of the rock mass below the volcano			0
‘ this could eventually lead to transport of magma to the surface			0
‘ we can say that there is a high risk , there is a zone , an area that we image , that shows an anomaly of pressure			0
‘ there were theories that the magma should be quite pressurised because the last eruption was 300 years ago			0
‘ for the first time we made a direct observation of this kind of critical stage			0
but he adds it is not possible within their results for the researchers to give an exact timescale for when an eruption might occur .			0

@entity24 and @entity1 scientists say @entity14 is at higher risk of eruption
pressure beneath the volcano was *increased* by the 2011 earthquake
the researchers used an array of 800 seismic sensors to make findings
and they found it mimics conditions from last eruption of @entity14 in 1707
while an eruption is not imminent the ' risk is clearly higher ' they say
