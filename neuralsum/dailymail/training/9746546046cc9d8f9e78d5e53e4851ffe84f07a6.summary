but those minor issues pale in comparison to one young mother - who was forced to cancel her wedding plans when she gave birth just hours after finding out that she was pregnant - for the second time			1
@entity1 , 24 , was unaware she was pregnant when she went into labour and gave birth to a son last saturday			1
but what might sound like a once - in - a - lifetime shock was actually familiar territory for the young mum and her partner @entity18 , 34			0
just 18 - months - ago @entity1 gave birth to her daughter @entity19 , five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant			1
now the proud parents , who have another daughter @entity22 , three , have welcomed baby @entity23 into the brood - born just 12 minutes after his worried mum arrived at the hospital			2
the couple , who have been together for seven years , had spent the last eighteen months battling to make it down the aisle			0
but the unexpected arrival of @entity19 , on may 14 , 2012 , saw them cancel their booking at @entity33 register office and swap their nuptials for nappies			1
only last week @entity1 and @entity18 resumed making wedding plans , which have now been put on hold again after the weekend 's unexpected arrival			1
just six months before @entity41 's surprise birth - when @entity1 was two months pregnant - she and @entity18 decided that they were n't going to have any more children and gave away all of their baby supplies			1
just 18 - months - ago @entity1 , seen with partner @entity18 , gave birth to her daughter @entity19 , five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant but after finishing work at 12.30am on saturday morning after a long shift in a working men 's club , @entity1 started to feel pain in her back at her home in @entity54 , @entity33			1
the pain became so severe as the night progressed that @entity18 phoned an ambulance - by which point baby @entity23 was already crowning			2
@entity18 , a kitchen fitter , said : ' the nurse told me to check down there and i got a shock and a half			0
' i ’m not a midwife but i know the top of a head when i see one			0
' @entity1 was crying her eyes out			2
' @entity19 and @entity22 were climbing all over trying to see what was going on			0
' she was just saying , " it ca n't be happening again , you 're wrong "			0
surprise ! @entity19 , aged 18 months , and baby @entity23 were both unexpected arrivals for their parents @entity23 was born at 6.40 am , and weighed a healthy 7lb 13 ' the nurse said to get towels but we have n't got a tumble dryer and they were all wet			1
' i was panicking then and she said , " you sit yourself down and breathe as well "			0
' it was total deja vu			0
' remarkably , @entity1 did n’t notice putting on any weight during either pregnancy , and friends even commented that she looked to have lost a few pounds on both occasions			2
throughout both pregnancies @entity1 was taking the contraceptive pill every day and had periods every month			1
@entity1 , who also works as a nursery nurse , said : ' i just could n’t believe it			2
' i was in total shock			0
“ both times there had been no clues			0
' on the day @entity19 was born i had been to the park , done grocery shopping and been out and about - all while being in labour			1
' with @entity23 i had been to work all day			0
' i never thought it could happen again in a million years			0
' @entity23 was born at 6.40 am , and weighed a healthy 7lb 13 - but 7lb 7oz @entity19 ’s arrival last year was far more complicated			1
@entity1 did n't notice putting on any weight during either pregnancy , and friends even commented that she looked to have lost a few pounds on both occasions ' @entity18 , a kitchen fitter , said : ' i got a shock and a half			2
i 'm not a midwife but i know the top of a head when i see one ' again , @entity1 was suffering from backache , and after arriving at the @entity113 , found she was 8cm dilated and about to give birth			1
the placenta had dried and if the pregnancy had been left undetected for just a few more days , both @entity1 and @entity19 would have died			2
after birth , @entity19 was diagnosed with plagiocephaly - a condition which means the head is misshapen - and still has to wear a helmet 23 hours a day			2
@entity1 and @entity18 have also missed out on two holidays after @entity19 ’s unexpected birth and complications with her treatment saw them cancel trips to @entity127 and @entity128 , but the happy couple would n’t have it any other way			1
' when are you ever really ready for children ? ' said @entity18			0
' you just get on with it			0
' the girls dote on him and we could n’t be happier			0
