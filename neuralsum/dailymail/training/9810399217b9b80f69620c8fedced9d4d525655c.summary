by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:17 est , 27 february 2014 the prospect of a @entity5 race through the streets of central @entity7 took a huge step forward today when ministers entered a consultation over a radical overhaul of road safety and speed limit laws			1
a detailed 3.2 mile circuit is believed to have drawn up by @entity5 supremo @entity15 that would see the likes of @entity17 and @entity18 start on @entity19 and race past @entity21 and through @entity22			1
experts predict a @entity25 - style event through the capital could be worth well over £ 100million in ticket revenue and endorsements but would currently require an @entity29 to suspend 30mph speed limits and other safety laws along the length of the route			1
local authorities already have the power to close roads for sporting events but not to suspend traffic laws and the requirement for a vehicle to be road legal			2
the consultation launched today by culture secretary @entity59 is over whether they should also be allowed to suspend the @entity61 and , if successful , would pave the way for a @entity63			2
mrs @entity59 said : ' the excitement and buzz of motor sports attracts a legion of dedicated fans and drives investment			0
' looking at whether local authorities should be able to close public roads for road races and other motor sports could mean millions of extra pounds going to local communities			1
' the @entity74 is a world leader in the motor sport industry , supporting jobs and promoting our manufacturing and high tech engineering skills			0
' experts predict a @entity25 - style event through the capital could be worth well over £ 100million in ticket revenue and endorsements if the proposal is successful @entity5 bosses would still need to secure permission from @entity89 to stage the event			1
@entity91 , the council 's @entity92 , said : ' we are always keen for @entity89 to set the stage for world - class events and attractions so will obviously be following the progress of this legislation very closely			0
' if it passes , however , it would just be the first step			0
we would then explore the practicalities with our partners to see if and how @entity5 really could take to the streets of @entity7			1
' mayor @entity104 has previously spoken in favour of the plan provided issues with pollution and noise impact are addressed			1
his spokesperson said today : ' the mayor thinks @entity5 is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host , and he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth			1
' he is positive that @entity7 would do a spectacular job of holding a @entity63 ; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning , consultation and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully			1
' the mayor added it was important to see if there was ' a really good economic case ' for a @entity63			2
the idea also has the support of several senior government ministers including minister without portfolio @entity134 , @entity136 , the @entity137 , and @entity138			2
mr @entity134 said : ' i am delighted that the government has been able to propose the necessary legal changes to enable motor racing events to be held occasionally for various categories of racing in towns and cities in different parts of the country			0
' @entity150 safety and environmental standards are always protected at sports events			0
' the proposal is to sweep away a few absurd legal problems to exempt a motor race from the ordinary traffic rules that apply to a commuter traffic jam			2
' motor sports is one of the this country ’s industrial and sporting strengths			0
' @entity162 believes the race would be even more impressive than the @entity164 , currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing ’s street circuits			0
@entity74 drivers @entity18 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) could soon be racing through the streets of @entity7 @entity162 believes the race would be even more impressive than the @entity164 ( pictured ) , currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing 's street circuits in 2012 @entity162 said : ‘ with the way things are , maybe we would front it and put the money up for it			1
if we got the okay and everything was fine , i think we could do that			0
' think what it would do for tourism			0
it would be fantastic — good for @entity7 , good for @entity184 — a lot better than the @entity186			2
’ a @entity63 is not a new idea and was first raised by the government in 2011 , but since then the launch of a formal consultation has been tied up in @entity192 wrangling			0
the move is expected to meet with opposition from environmental groups			0
@entity196 , a @entity197 member described the race through @entity7 as a ' terrible idea '			1
he said : ' @entity5 should stick to the dedicated race tracks and leave our streets form ordinary @entity203 to enjoy			1
' the consultation could also reach outside @entity5 and remove potential legal obstacles to holding @entity207 cycle stages in @entity208 and @entity209 this july			2
under existing laws support vehicles following the riders will technically be breaking speed limits .			0

@entity5 race through @entity7 could be worth well over £ 100million
proposal to allow races on public roads was put forward today
@entity221 likely to include @entity22 , @entity19 and @entity40
@entity7 mayor @entity104 is understood to *broadly* support the plan
