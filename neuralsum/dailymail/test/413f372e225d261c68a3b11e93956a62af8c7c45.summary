an astonishing letter from the @entity2 's owners to the family of a dead officer asking for a huge sum of money to return his dead body to @entity8 has been uncovered 103 years on from the tragedy			1
the letter , dated may 7 , 1912 , was sent from @entity11 to @entity12 , the brother of 24 - year - old officer @entity13 , who died after the @entity2 hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage			1
in it , company bosses demand £ 20 - the equivalent of £ 2,000 in today 's money - to return his body to @entity8 , and state that @entity12 will have to pick up the tab from there			1
' should you after further consideration desire the remains of your brother to be returned will you kindly telegraph us in the morning at the same time sending us a deposit of £ 20 for any expenses and land charges on the other @entity59 and we will at once cable @entity60 asking then to arrange this if practicable			1
@entity13 was born in @entity37 in 1887 , the son of @entity64 , a twon councillor , and @entity66			2
privately schooled , he was sent away to @entity67 in @entity68 where he graduated with a masters in 1911			0
he went straight into service as an officer , first working on the @entity72 , before transferring to her ill - fated relative in 1912 , then aged 24			2
serving as the vessel 's sixth junior officer , he set sail on her maiden voyage from @entity53 to @entity60 on april 14 , 1912 , along with 2,224 passengers and crew			1
two days later , as the boat was passing through the northern @entity51 , @entity13 was on night watch when he received a call from one of the lookouts at 11.40pm			2
' what do you see ? ' @entity13 asked			2
the man replied : ' @entity89 , right ahead ! ' after the collision , @entity13 was seen on deck all night , helping passengers into the lifeboats , and declining to go himself , despite all his junior officer colleagues escaping			1
he was last seen shortly before 2.20am , when the boat finally slipped under , still trying to launch more lifeboats			0
today there is a memorial to him in @entity37 , with the inscription : ' greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends			0
' ' we also think it right to point out that the arrangements and expenses for taking charge of the remains after arrival of the steamer at @entity52 or @entity53 would be on your account			0
' instead , the company suggests that mr @entity13 's remains be buried in @entity118 with the other survivors , but they offer to send his family ' a photograph of the tombstone ' , if they want one			1
even more shocking is the fact that mr @entity13 's body had not been recovered by the time the letter was sent , and bosses would have known that , as all remains were cataloged			1
the remains of mr @entity13 , who was on watch when the ship struck the iceberg and later helped passengers into the lifeboats while declining a space for himself , have never been found			1
mr @entity13 was among the 1,500 passengers and crew to die aboard the @entity2 when it sank in the north @entity51 on april 14 1912 , two days into her maiden voyage			1
he had been serving as the @entity2 's sixth officer , and was the only junior officer to perish after staying behind to help evacuate the passengers after the other officers left			1
born in @entity37 in 1887 to @entity64 , a town councillor , and @entity66 , @entity13 was privately educated before being sent to @entity67 in @entity68			2
he passed his masters exams there in 1911 before becoming an officer			0
he was originally stationed on the @entity147 , the @entity2 's sister ship , but transferred just months before the disaster in 1912			1
the letter has come to light after being listed for auction by a collector who acquired it directly from @entity13 's family			2
experts at @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity159 , have described the two - page letter as ' beyond comprehension ' and say it could make £ 25,000 when it goes under the hammer			0
mr @entity13 ( front left ) , 24 , was the @entity2 's sixth officer , and the only junior officer to die on board while helping passengers into the lifeboats , long after his colleagues had abandoned ship the @entity2 ( pictured ) , sank on april 14 , 1912 , on her maiden voyage from @entity53 to @entity60 , after colliding with an iceberg in the northern @entity51 @entity174 , from the auctioneers , said : ' @entity44 is asking for £ 20 , which was a colossal amount of money in 1912 , for the return of the body of one of their own officers			1
' the mere concept of requiring payment for the return of the body of anyone who died on @entity2 - let alone one of the ship 's officers - is just beyond comprehension			1
' it is an horrific act on the part of @entity11			0
you ca n't imagine how @entity12 must have felt to have been greeted with a letter like this when he was grieving for the loss of his brother			2
' what 's more , the £ 20 @entity11 were asking for did not cover getting the body home or to the undertakers once it arrived in @entity8			1
' but where this letter is most shocking is the fact that @entity13 's body had not been - and never was - recovered in the aftermath			1
' when this letter was sent the recovery ships had already arrived in @entity60 and the bodies they had found had been identified and catalogued			0
' you would like to think the sending of this letter was an administrative error but it 's open to a lot of interpretation			0
' the implications are huge - how many families of the deceased did @entity11 ask for payment from ? ' @entity13 was an incredibly brave man , helping to get passengers into liferafts and choosing to stay with the ship until the bitter end			1
' it appears that @entity11 treated his body as a commodity , which callous in the extreme			0
' @entity2 sank in the @entity51 on 15 april 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from @entity53 , @entity233 to @entity60 , @entity234			2
more than 1,500 people died when the ship sank carrying 2,224 passengers and crew under the command of @entity240			2
some of the wealthiest people in the world were onboard the ship , including property tycoon @entity244 , great grandson of @entity244 , founder of the @entity245			0
millionaire @entity246 , heir to his family ’s mining business , also perished , along with @entity249 , the @entity250 - born co-owner of @entity252 's department store			0
the ship was the largest afloat at the time and was designed in such a way that it was meant to be ' unsinkable '			0
it had an on - board gym , libraries , pool as well as several restaurants and luxury first class cabins			0
there were not enough lifeboats on board for all the passengers due to out - of - date maritime safety regulations			0
after leaving @entity53 on 10 april 1912 , @entity2 called at @entity268 in @entity269 and @entity270 in @entity271 before heading to @entity60			0
on 14 april 1912 , four days into the crossing she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship 's time			1
@entity13 was on night watch when the collision happened , and took the call from the watchman , asking him ' what do you see ? ' , the man responded : ' @entity89 , dead ahead			0
' by 2.20am , with hundreds of people still on board , the ship plunged beneath the waves , taking many , including @entity13 , with it			2
despite repeated distress calls being sent out , and flares launched from the decks , the first ship arrived nearly two hours later , pulling 710 people from the water			0
it was not until 73 years later that the wreck of the ship was discovered on the ocean floor .			0

@entity13 , 24 , officer on the @entity2 , died helping passengers escape
brother @entity12 wrote to ship 's owners asking for body to be returned
was sent a reply asking for £ 20 , or £ 2,000 in today 's money , to comply
instead bosses offered brother a picture of his headstone *overseas*
