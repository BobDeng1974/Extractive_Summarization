such attacks could come from any of a number of different sources , he said , while not ruling out that his own military could launch them			0
@entity0 described possible future retaliation against the @entity5 as ' not necessarily through the government			1
it 's not only – the government is not the only player in this region			0
we have different parties , you have different factions , you have different ideologies			0
you have everything in this region now			0
so you have to expect that			0
' when @entity46 asked if that included the possibility of chemical warfare , @entity0 replied , ' that depends			2
' ' if the rebels or the terrorists in this region , or any other group have it – it could happen			0
i 'm not a fortune teller , to tell you what will happen			0
' anti-government rebel groups in @entity6 include both @entity64 factions and @entity66 groups , including the global terror group @entity10			1
retaliation against the @entity5 , he acknowledged , ' could take different forms , both direct and indirect , ' hinting that he could work in concert with @entity9 and the @entity11			1
the @entity6 leader , on the brink of seeing @entity100 missiles and predator drones rain down on his own military installations , said that @entity14 's administration is ' going to pay the price if you 're not wise in dealing with the terrorists			2
' ' so nobody expects – there are going to be repercussions ... nobody expected the 11th of september , so you can not expect – it would be difficult for anybody to tell you what is going to happen			0
' ' it 's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion			0
you have to expect everything			0
' @entity5 secretary of state @entity121 said monday in @entity122 that @entity0 could avoid a military strike by turning over all his chemical weapons within a week but immediately made clear he was sure that would never happen anti-war protesters held signs and banners outside the @entity129 in central @entity122 on monday as @entity121 met with @entity131 's foreign minister @entity130 polls show that t vanishing minority of @entity5 support striking @entity6 , and @entity14 will have to contend with a growing protest movement at home as he tries to convince @entity136 to endorse military action @entity0 has denied that he was responsible for the suspected august 21 sarin gas attack aimed at a rebel - controlled area of @entity6 , and challenged the @entity14 administration to publicly show the evidence it has and ' prove it now			1
' the president ' did n't present ' evidence publicly ' because he does n't have [ it ]			0
@entity121 does n't have [ it ] , no one in the organization has			2
if they had it they would have presented it to you as media			0
' this week is shaping up as a critical one in the @entity14 administration 's second term : @entity14 will address the nation tuesday night in a prepared prime - time address the president has granted rare sit - down interviews with @entity24 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity74 national security advisor @entity165 will address a luncheon at 12:30 at the @entity167 , laying out the administration 's case for attacking the @entity170 will gavel in a session monday afternoon that may culminate in a vote on whether to authorize the use of ' limited ' military force in @entity6 a @entity176 committee is likely to debate the same measure this week , but may not hold a vote at all if a majority of the dominant republicans decline to support the measure secretary of state @entity121 is selling the @entity85 's plan in @entity131 , and the president is personally calling members of @entity136 to lobby them former secretary of state @entity186 will reportedly offer her take on @entity6 monday , and is expected to support @entity14 's call for military intervention @entity14 will sit down monday afternoon for interviews with the three major tv networks and with @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity74			1
he is also scheduled to address the nation in a prime - time speech tuesday night – on the eve of this year 's 9/11 anniversary			1
@entity46 reminded @entity0 that secretary of state @entity121 has disclosed that the @entity5 was able to track the flight of missiles originating from government - controlled @entity6 territory and landing in an area overrun by rebels			1
' we know that his regime gave orders to prepare for a chemical attack , ' @entity121 said during a press conference monday at the @entity207 @entity129			1
' we know that they deployed forces and put them in the places where this took place			0
we know , by tracing it , physically where the rockets came from and where they landed			0
and it is no accident that they all came from regime - controlled territory and all landed in opposition - controlled or contested territory			2
' but ' the @entity83 have completely opposite evidence , ' @entity0 countered to @entity46 , ' that the missiles were thrown from an area where the rebels control			1
' he likened the current controversy to then - secretary of state @entity231 's public presentation before @entity136 of evidence , which later proved faulty , that @entity234 dictator @entity233 possessed weapons of mass destruction			1
that evidence was the basis for the approval of a @entity5 - led invasion			2
' he said " this is our evidence , " @entity0 recalled , but ' it was false evidence			2
@entity121 did n't even present evidence			2
he [ said ] " we have evidence " and he did n't present anything			0
not a single shred of evidence			0
' ultimately , @entity0 insisted , his government forces ' were not in the area where the alleged chemical attack happened ... our soldiers in another area were attacked chemically			2
they went to the hospital as casualties because of chemical weapons			2
' @entity83 foreign minister @entity261 ( r ) and @entity6 foreign minister @entity262 ( @entity263 ) met monday in @entity264			1
@entity83 's government remains one of @entity6 's only allies , with ties strengthened by arms sales and a @entity83 naval base on @entity6 soil @entity0 insists that the @entity85 does n't have ironclad evidence that his government used chemical weapons , and said @entity14 is leading a ' social media administration ' ' but in the area where they say the government used chemical weapons , we only had video , and we only have pictures and allegations			1
... how can you talk about what happened if you do n't have evidence ? ' ' we 're not like the @entity5 administration			2
we 're not a social - media administration or government			0
we are a government that deals with reality			0
' members of @entity136 should ask themselves , he said , ' what do wars give @entity5 ? seems there 's is nothing now			1
no political gain , no economic gain , no good reputation			0
' @entity5 's credibility around the world , @entity0 claimed , is an ' an all - time low			1
' he also insisted , as several high - profile politicians have in @entity304 , that starting a war in @entity6 would be ' against the interests of the @entity5			1
' ' why ? first of all because this is the war that 's going to support @entity10 and the same people who killed @entity5 on the 11th of september			1
' in @entity264 on monday , @entity83 foreign minister @entity261 met with @entity6 foreign minister @entity262 to discuss the increasingly tense situation			1
we are asking ourselves how @entity14 can ... support those who in their time blew up the @entity315 in @entity316 , @entity262 said during a press conference following the meeting			0
@entity261 claimed there was clear evidence the @entity322 rebels have chemical weapons , and hinted that there are still questions about who initiated the august 21 attack .			1

@entity6 's dictator told @entity22 that rebel groups or terrorists in his country may have chemical weapons that could strike @entity5 targets
retaliation for a @entity5 attack , he hinted , could also come ' indirectly ' via @entity11
@entity0 said @entity83 has evidence that *contradicts* what secretary of state @entity121 has been telling @entity136
@entity344 foreign minister said in @entity264 that attacking the @entity0 regime would amount to helping @entity10
@entity5 's credibility around the world , @entity0 claimed , is an ' an all - time low '
