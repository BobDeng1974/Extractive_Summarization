divers have found a bizarre alien ' slime ' in water - filled underground caves beneath @entity4 ’s @entity3			2
researchers were stunned to find life in the deep cave			0
they reported unique ‘ curtains ’ of biological material now known as @entity3 cave slimes			1
a ' curtain ' of slime found by @entity4 divers in water - filled underground caves beneath @entity3 the researchers say the organisms that make up the @entity17 cave slime community survive in a very unusual way – by oxidizing ammonia in the salty cave water			1
they are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface , the researchers say			0
researchers @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 from @entity31 are exploring how this alien ecosystem works			0
they published their findings this week in the journal of the @entity35 , showing that an unusual combination of microbes thrive in the @entity38 in the underground system			0
' earlier studies on the community suggested that there was an unusual chemistry going on in the caves , but we did n’t know how the microbes were making a living in the cave environment , ' says the lead scientist professor @entity30 of @entity31			2
in order to find this ‘ missing link ’ , the team of researchers made use of a range of new technologies , such as next - generation sequencing of environmental dna and scanning electron microscopy to take an in - depth look at the composition of the @entity17 cave slime community			2
they found a dominant group of organisms in the cave slimes , known as the @entity67			1
this community of microbes thrives in the total dark , independent of photosynthesis			1
the alien cave slime under a microscope : the slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty water and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface another of the alien slime communities found in the cave it is thought that the inundations of the @entity3 caves by the sea occurred a number of times in the past and so researchers suggest that the @entity91 may have a marine origin			1
' we know that the @entity3 ’s karst system arose from the sea in the middle miocene period and so this may be a clue as to where the @entity91 came from , ' says professor @entity30			0
the research team says this analysis shows that the organisms that make up the @entity17 cave slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty cave water – and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface			1
' it just goes to show that life in the dark recesses of the planet comes in many strange forms , many of which are still unknown , ' says professor @entity30			0
the entrance to the cave system under @entity4 's @entity3 the @entity3 , in red , is well known for its underground cave system			0
