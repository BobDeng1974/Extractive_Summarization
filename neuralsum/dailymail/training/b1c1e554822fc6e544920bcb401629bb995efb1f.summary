by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 13:01 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 31 october 2013 cameras are to be allowed into court for the first time from today , ending a 90 - year ban			1
the decision to allow filming of the closing stages of cases at the @entity10 has been hailed as a ‘ landmark moment for justice and journalism ’			1
ministers rejected fears it would lead to ‘ @entity17 ’ of the justice system , where trials of the likes of @entity21 to @entity22 have become treated as entertainment			1
in focus : cameras have been positioned around the @entity26 to broadcast live pictures from selected court cases from tomorrow hidden : remote - controlled cameras tucked away on bookcases will capture the summing up and sentencing of selected cases it will be the first time that cameras have been allowed in courts other than the @entity36 since filming was banned by the @entity38			1
lawyers ' arguments and judges ' summing up , decision and - in criminal cases - sentencing remarks may be filmed			1
however victims , witnesses and defendants will not be captured on camera and proceedings will only be shown from one courtroom per day			1
small , remote - controlled cameras will be operated by the court video journalist @entity53 , who has both legal and journalistic qualifications			1
while the footage can be used by news and current affairs programmes but it can not feature in adverts or on comedy shows like have i got news for you			0
the filming could be extended , with ministers now considering allow cameras to capture sentencing remarks in @entity68 , with victims , witnesses , offenders and jurors still protected			2
limits : court video journalist @entity74 will operate the cameras and ensure that no witnesses are seen on screen from @entity79 to judge @entity80 , from @entity21 to @entity22 , a host of pop - culture personas have been cited when airing anxieties over filming in court			1
a fear of ‘ @entity17 ’ the justice system has been frequently raised by critics of allowing cameras in court , particularly in the wake of the trials of @entity21 and dr @entity91 in the @entity92 and @entity93 in @entity94			1
the @entity21 murder trial in @entity96 , where the former professional american football player was accused of killing his wife and a friend , was one of the first major cases to catch the public 's attention			1
footage of @entity21 's lawyer , @entity105 , standing in front of the jury holding a glove saying ‘ if it does n't fit , you must acquit ’ has gone down in courtroom history			1
@entity21 was acquitted in 1995			2
@entity113 mp sir @entity112 , who enjoyed a lengthy career in broadcasting before joining @entity116 , said : ‘ this is not about transparency or democracy , it is about television showbusiness and we do not need our law courts to be turned into yet another reality tv show			2
’ the decision to open up courts to the tv media comes after years of campaigning by broadcasters @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity134 , @entity130 director of news and current affairs , said : ‘ this is a landmark moment for justice and journalism			0
it is a significant step on the way to helping millions of viewers gain a greater understanding of how our judicial system works			0
’ judges hope the move will allow the public to better understand what actually happens in court			2
the most senior judge in @entity152 and @entity153 , lord chief justice @entity154 , said : ‘ ‘ this will help a wider audience to understand and see for themselves how the @entity10 goes about its work			2
’ there are a number of safeguards in place to protect the administration of justice , ensure no disruption to proceedings and protect witnesses and victims			0
some cases will be broadcast live with a 70 - second delay to allow the removal of anything that contravenes broadcasting regulations or standard court reporting restrictions - such as contempt of court laws and court orders			1
in addition , appeals against conviction which might result in a re-trial will only be shown once the case is decided , and and the judge can order no filming or broadcasting if it is in the interests of justice			0
@entity131 chief executive @entity187 said : ‘ filming in courts has been a long time coming and is for the benefit of open justice and democracy			2
never before will television viewers have had such an insight to justice being seen to be done			0
’ head of sky news @entity133 said : ‘ seeing justice being done will no longer be restricted to those members of the public who have the opportunity and time to go to court			2
‘ we anticipate that the next step should be to allow the filming of sentencing remarks in criminal trials , which the coalition government envisaged when it first announced the lifting of the camera ban two years ago			1
’ almost all the proceedings of the @entity36 have been filmed since it opened in 2009 and are sometimes broadcast on major tv and radio news networks			0
and broadcasters in @entity214 have been allowed to apply to film in court since 1992 , but only with the consent of all parties			0
screen : the cameras will be monitored from the floor of the court , as seen here in @entity224 at the @entity26 in @entity225 a pilot took place in the @entity10 in the @entity26 in 2005 , in which cameras were allowed to film in the court			1
footage from the pilot study was not broadcast			0
courts minister @entity233 said : ‘ this is a landmark moment that will give the public the opportunity to see and hear the decisions of judges in their own words			0
‘ it is another significant step towards achieving our aim of having an open and transparent justice system			0
‘ we are clear that justice must be seen to be done and people will now have the opportunity to see that process with their own eyes			0
it will also help further the public 's understanding of the often - complex process of criminal and civil proceedings			2
’ captured : one of the most famous snatched pictures from an @entity152 court was taken of dr @entity257 with @entity258 , his alleged accomplice , during their trial for murder in 1910 the ban on bringing cameras into court - including video cameras - dates back to 1925			1
but even before this date , taking pictures was not supported by the court and photographers were supposed to seek permission			0
one of the most famous ‘ snatched ’ pictures from a courtroom was taken of the notorious @entity257 and his mistress @entity258 in 1910 as he stood trial for the murder of his wife			1
while publishing photos from courtrooms was debated in the @entity280 and broadly opposed by politicians , it was not until 1925 that legislation was brought in banning photos and sketches			0
a small passage in the @entity38 , which mainly dealt with the system of probation , said : ‘ no person shall ( a ) take or attempt to take in any court any photograph , or with a view to publication make or attempt to make in any court any portrait or sketch , of any person , being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court , whether civil or criminal ; or ( b ) publish any photograph , portrait or sketch taken or made in contravention of the foregoing provisions of this section or any reproduction thereof			0
’ more recently , individuals who have taken photographs in court have been dealt with under contempt of court laws rather than under the @entity316			0
a 19 - year - old man who took pictures inside @entity319 on his mobile phone was jailed for two months in 2011 , while a @entity321 was held behind bars for two hours after taking a picture during @entity325 's appearance at the @entity326			2
since it opened in 2009 , almost all the proceedings of the @entity36 are filmed and are sometimes broadcast on major tv and radio news networks			0
even under the latest changes there is no chance of a dr @entity257 style shot - only judges ' remarks will be shown - not those of victims , witnesses , offenders or jurors .			1

filming to be permitted in court for the first time since 1925
closing stages of cases at the @entity10 will be captured on camera
judges and lawyers will be seen , with witnesses and defendants off - screen
critics fear @entity357 could copy @entity92 show trials like @entity21 's
@entity360 was *imposed* after snatched photo of dr @entity257 's murder trial in 1910
