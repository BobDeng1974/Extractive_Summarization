president @entity4 has backed off a request for @entity3 to give his administration more latitude to deport illegal immigrant children coming to the @entity9 from @entity10 , two high - profile @entity1 members of @entity3 said today			1
senate minority leader @entity11 and @entity13 chairman @entity12 claimed this morning that the president did not include a formal request for @entity3 to change the existing law after telling them in a letter last week he supported revisions because his party successfully pressured him not to			1
@entity22 minority leader @entity21 did not indicate that her caucus had asked the president to backtrack but made clear today in her weekly briefing with reporters that she was not in favor of amending the law to allow the @entity29 to immediately send children from non-contiguous countries back home			1
president @entity4 , pictured here today in @entity33 , @entity34 , was expected to formally ask @entity3 to loosen deportation restrictions for illegal immigrant children from @entity10 but that has n't happened president @entity4 arrives at an event on the economy at the @entity40 in @entity33 , @entity34 this afternoon current law requires children who illegally immigrate to the @entity9 through the southern border and originate from anywhere but @entity45 be taken into custody by the @entity29			1
@entity29 then has 72 hours to turn them over to the @entity47			0
from there , the government requires that they are given court dates and hearings to determine if they qualify for refugee status before they can be returned to their home countries			0
the @entity22 has admitted that very few of the children will actually obtain refugee status , so giving them due process , which can take months , is a mostly a waste of time and money			0
in a letter to congressional leaders last monday , president @entity4 said his administration would be following up with an official request to have the 2008 law loosened			1
' we are eager to work with the @entity3 to ensure that we have the legal authorities to maximize the impact of our efforts @entity72 - wide strategy as the influx of migrants continues , ' @entity4 said			1
' initially , we believe this may include ... providing the @entity77 additional authority to exercise discretion in processing the return and removal of unaccompanied minor children from non-contiguous countries like @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85 , ' @entity4 said , ' and increasing penalties for those who smuggle vulnerable migrants , like children			1
' the president also forewarned congressional leaders that he would be asking them for additional funds for agencies that handle illegal immigration in order to pay for a variety of programs associated with the surge in unaccompanied minors crossing the border			1
more than 52,000 children , coming primarily from @entity10 , have crossed the border since last october , and the administration expects as many as 100,000 to come before year 's end			2
president @entity4 meets with @entity106 student @entity105 , right , at the @entity107 in @entity33 , @entity34 this morning			0
the president is a short plane ride away from the border but has no plans to visit it before returning to @entity113 this afternoon yet , when the president made his request on tuesday for $ 3.7 billion in supplemental funds for immigration authorities he did not include legislative language to reform the 2008 trafficking law			1
the president said in a letter accompanying his budget request that he would work with @entity3 to amend the law separately			1
at a press briefing later that afternoon , @entity22 press secretary @entity124 played down concerns that the president was walking back his call for @entity3 to change the law			1
@entity124 said the administration did n't include specific language simply because it wanted to give @entity3 the space to do its job			1
he also divulged that senior @entity22 officials had been in touch with senior officials of @entity3 to discuss what the amended law might look like			2
pressed to explain what the @entity22 would like to see @entity3 give @entity29 the ability to do other than have ' more discretion , ' @entity124 was unable to come up with an answer			1
the president neither wants @entity10 children to bypass medical care by @entity47 nor does he want them to be denied due process , he said , effectively ruling out changes to the main steps in the deportation process			1
at the time , the newly minted @entity22 press secretary 's comments were interpreted as either verbal ineptitude or evidence that the @entity22 does not have a strategy to deal with the crisis at the border outside of throwing money at the problem			0
however , statements by members of @entity3 on thursday suggest that the @entity22 was in fact being purposefully opaque about legislative changes it would like to see to to the immigration law because its earlier proposition fell flat with members of the @entity166			1
in a speech on the @entity170 floor earlier today , minority leader @entity167 accused the president of requesting a ' blank check ' from @entity3			0
' he led @entity9 to believe that the problem could be solved if only @entity3 would pass his last - minute request			2
but it ’s not that simple – much more needs to be done , and the president knows it , ' the @entity1 leader said			0
' his original letter to @entity3 called for reforms we all know are needed to address this crisis			2
under pressure from the @entity184 , he has since backed away from those critical reforms , but lawmakers in both parties have not			0
' in an interview on @entity191 this morning , @entity189 chairman @entity12 also suggested that @entity4 changed his tune because he could n't get his party , which controlled @entity3 when the trafficking law was passed in 2008 , to get behind amending it			1
' well , initially he talked about changing this 2008 law , which when @entity45 cross they are expeditiously removed			0
when other than @entity45 cross , like @entity10 , a different policy , ' @entity12 said			0
' all we wan na do is make the policy the same with @entity45 and other than @entity45			0
' ' the president was going to propose that idea , and then for some reason - i think because he got hit by the @entity184 - retracted that policy and now is throwing it on the @entity3 to resolve that problem , ' he added			0
president @entity4 greets people as he arrives to buy bbq at @entity209 in @entity33 @entity4 cut two people in line , but made up for it by paying for their meals @entity4 tried to pay for the meals with cash but had to pay with a card after he realized the bill was more than $ 300 @entity12 and @entity167 's suspicions are backed up by comments made by members of the president 's party			2
in an interview with @entity225 published tuesday evening , @entity166 rep. @entity223 came out against the president 's proposal			0
' you know what , it feels very piecemeal to me , ' she said			0
' i think one reason we 're in this crisis right now is we have n't dealt with immigration in a comprehensive kind of way			0
' ' i would worry that if we start picking and choosing which parts of the law we 're going to enforce or repeal , that we 're not going to get to the core of what the problem is , ' she continued			0
@entity22 minority leader @entity21 told reporters today that if @entity3 made any changes to the law at all , she would prefer that @entity45 children be treated the same as @entity10 children and be given health screenings and court hearings instead of being automatically sent home rather than @entity10 children being shut of the court system			1
' i would hope they would not make that change , ' she said , referring to @entity10 children being sent home as soon as they reach the border			1
however , she said ' it 's not a deal - breaker			0
' ' @entity263 , i think that @entity1 would like to do worse , ' she said , so ' let 's mitigate with that change for increased resources ' for things like due process , and pass a bill to help the children			2
house speaker @entity271 was tight - lipped today about his position on @entity4 's request for additional funding and the absence of language in the request for changes to the 2008 trafficking law			1
' @entity280 is n't that convenient , ' is all he had to say when a reporter brought up the president 's backtrack			0
asked by another reporter if he thought the law should be changed , @entity271 said , ' i do , and i think the president agrees with it as well			0
' @entity271 said he still needed to talk to his caucus before making a final decision on whether to approve @entity4 's request for supplemental funding but said the one thing he would not do is write the president a blank check			2
neither @entity296 's office nor @entity167 's offices returned requests for comments on whether the @entity1 leaders had discussed changes to the trafficking law with the @entity22 in the last week			2
at a hearing this afternoon on the president 's budget request , homeland security secretary @entity303 clarified that one of the changes the @entity22 would like to see to immigration legislation is the authority to ask unaccompanied children who originate from @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity83 to voluntarily return home without going through the standard immigration process			2
@entity303 said the @entity22 believes that would significantly speed up the rate of repatriation .			0

@entity4 sent a letter to @entity3 asking them to change a law *barring* the government from automatically deporting @entity10 children
@entity4 said he **'d** like @entity3 to give the @entity29 more discretion in applying the law
he also *informed* @entity3 that he **'d** be asking for additional money for agencies that handle illegal immigration
when he submitted his formal proposal this week he did not include legislative language to change current law , only a request for funds
@entity1 say its because his party talked him out of it
