' @entity5 players expressed their disgust at the racist remarks @entity7 allegedly made to his mistress by hiding the team 's logo during sunday night 's game			1
and now the @entity2 players , including superstar @entity18 , took part in @entity20 before they took on the @entity20 in a touching display of solidarity to their @entity24 brothers			1
@entity38 , who works in the day - to - day operation of the team , said he pledged his support to his team 's players			2

' @entity32 commissioner @entity76 will hold a press conference tuesday in @entity78 to address the association 's investigation into the alleged racist remarks			0
@entity64 is facing significant pressure to punish @entity7 , however there is little modern precedent for the outrageous comments so it 's unclear what action will be taken			2
if he is somehow forced to sell the @entity5 , @entity7 would almost certainly bring about a lawsuit from the owner and a long and expensive legal fight			1

' this is a guy who , as the owner , sits courtside at the half - court line , ' @entity133 added			0
' no other owner sits like that			0
he has an ego the size of the @entity145			0
' the @entity5 players listen to the national anthem on sunday wearing their warmup jerseys inside out to protest alleged racial remarks by team owner @entity7 before game 4 of an opening - round @entity32 basketball playoff series against the @entity152 @entity7 's alleged recorded comments included a personal attack on @entity155 , pictured in november , which came as a shock to the @entity158 owner and retired @entity160 superstar @entity7 has faced extensive federal charges of civil rights violations and racial discrimination in business , making shocking race - related statements in sworn testimony before reaching multimillion - dollar settlements			1

' @entity7 's new embarrassment might lead to his long - term banishment from the @entity32			2

@entity204 , left , wife of @entity5 owner @entity7 , watches from a court side seat during the second half in game 4 of an opening - round @entity32 basketball playoff series between the @entity5 and @entity152 on sunday			1
she later had dinner with her estranged husband but amid the national outrage over the @entity5 owner 's apparent comments last weekend , former @entity32 star @entity211 asked the question that must be addressed by commissioner @entity76 and the owners who control the league			1
' we wanted ( @entity64 ) to give us a full accounting of the prior accusations of racism made against mr. @entity7 and why those were never sanctioned by the @entity32 , ' said @entity155 , who was asked by @entity5 guard @entity224 to speak for the players ' union membership			1
' it 's our responsibility to find out the history of mr. @entity7 , and why sanctions did not occur			0
