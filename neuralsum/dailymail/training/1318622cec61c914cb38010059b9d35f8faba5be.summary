he said the waste gave off a ' tremendous heat ' and that the foundations left below the property had started to decay , needing substantial work to repair them			1
inside the overgrown garden of the property were two vehicles , one was hidden in weeds , the other , a 4x4 that was used a dump , while inside the house rubbish was piled as high as the ceiling in some rooms			2
maggots and rats had ' infiltrated ' neighbouring properties and the gas meter , installed in 2007 , had never been used			2

the mammoth clearing operation , which began in august , saw a team of six people work to clean up the house , which had been occupied by a retired accountant in his 70s maggots and rats had ' infiltrated ' neighbouring properties due to the amount of waste piled up inside and the gas meter , installed in 2007 , had never been used one neighbour , who would not be named , said the occupant , a retired accountant in his seventies , had lived in the house for at least 40 years			1
he said : ' he is a very private man and i am shocked because he always dresses well and would always stop to tip his hat and exchange pleasantries in the street			2
we had no idea what was going on			2
' another neighbour , who would not be named , added : ' he bought the six cats recently to help with the rats and mice			2
' meanwhile mr @entity42 described the inside of the house as ' putrid ' and that there had been moves to clear the house without the intervention of the council			1
he said : ' there were thorough enquiries made and attempts to resolve it with authority intervention but sadly those attempts failed and the authority had no choice but to serve a notice under the @entity25			0
' we obtained a warrant from @entity24 ’ court to enter the grounds and the property for the purpose of removing filthy and verminous items			0
the owner - occupier is currently being cared for by partner agencies			0
a warrant was issued by @entity24 under the @entity126 to enter the house , which gave off a ' tremendous heat ' due to the waste inside ' it ’s putrid			1
it ’s day - to - day ( waste ) that the owner has n't cleared and then it has started to decompose			2
' the team had to clear the outside and that took a number of days just to get to the front door to enter			2
only then was it safe to commence the operation			0
' everything that comes out has to be logged			0
it ’s likely that it wo n’t be habitable for some considerable time			0
' a situation like that is not good for the occupier but also surrounding residents and whilst we accept that everyone is entitled to a lifestyle , when that starts to impact on adjoining properties – which it did in this case – we must intervene , ' he added			0
a council spokesperson said : ' the works to clear the house have now been completed and a full survey has been undertaken to assess all requirements to bring the property back to a lawful , habitable condition			1
this will , of course , take time			0

the council added : ' the cats belong to the owner occupier and will be removed into the care of a personal friend during all further works			0
' we have no concerns relating to their current condition or ongoing care and they have been fed and watered on a daily basis			0
