in the tunnel at @entity2 on saturday , it was easy to reminisce and think back to the time when @entity4 told @entity5 he had become the world 's greatest player			1
the sad thing about these two , texting buddies when @entity4 was at @entity10 and @entity11 , is that they appear to have lost touch			2
sometimes life moves on , too quickly in this case			0
there was an uneasy handshake with @entity18 's manager , some skin on skin as @entity5 settled into the visitors ' technical area before the 1 - 1 draw , but it was not the same			1
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity4 awkwardly shake hands before kick - off at @entity2 @entity5 , pictured under pressure from friend @entity28 , returned to face his old club @entity18 on saturday @entity4 stays focused on the game as @entity5 prepares to come off the bench for the champions the @entity34 board will decide whether to fine @entity18 manager @entity4 for his latest vow of silence			1
the @entity37 did not speak to the press following saturday 's clash with @entity40 after the @entity41 banned @entity42			1
last friday 's press conference was also cancelled			2
@entity34 chiefs will write to @entity4 and @entity18 for their reasons before the case is taken to the board			1
' i do n't want to try to say that there 's any issue at all , ' admitted @entity5 after his 13 - minute appearance as a substitute for @entity40			1
' i got a text at @entity54 , i texted him back			0
we spoke in the dressing room , ' how 's the family ? , ' the usual			2
' we are grown men , you know what i mean ? we are at different football clubs			0
i 'm sure we are big enough that none of this is going to get in the way of our relationship and how we are personally			0
this is football , it 's sport and i have n't spoken to him that much recently			2
' i do n't think there 's room for bitterness and if there is then i 'll deal with that down the line			2
' @entity5 dealt with his return to @entity2 in the way that anyone who has come across him during his professional career would expect him to : unruffled , polite , respectful and courteous			1
there were a few dissenting voices at @entity2 when he appeared as a 77th - minute substitute for the champions but his return home went as well could be expected			1
@entity18 fans unfurled a banner in tribute to @entity5 as the midfielder made his return to @entity2 the former @entity90 midfielder was given a largely positive reception from the home fans but this @entity18 was unhappy with @entity5 's decision to join title rivals @entity40 in the end , after these title rivals went away with a point each , @entity5 went into the @entity18 dressing room to share some memories of the three @entity34 titles , four @entity100 and the @entity101 that they won together in @entity18 's golden era			1
' it was lovely to get that reception at the end from the fans , ' he added			0
' i really appreciate that and i 'm a lucky boy			0
' i was nervous in general , to come here and be part of the away team is a bit nerve - wracking			2
' i went in the dressing room afterwards and saw all the people behind the scenes , loads of faces , it was brilliant			0
' @entity5 still has the drive and the desire to add another @entity34 title before he leaves @entity40 at the end of the season to move to @entity124			1
@entity125 places the ball past @entity40 goalkeeper @entity127 to put his side in the lead @entity18 striker @entity125 celebrates with the home fans after being given a chance in the absence of @entity42 this result , if not the performance , suited leaders @entity18 and @entity138 's team have their work cut out to retain the @entity34			1
five points is a lot of ground to make up			0
' @entity18 finished the first half of the season with 45 points , so it could be 90 or more , ' admitted @entity138			1
' of course the more points we drop the more difficult it is			0
we have to close a gap of five points , so it 's important not to drop more points			1
but i 'm sure all the teams will drop points			0
' there is rarely any conviction or authority in @entity138 's voice , but he knows what it takes to win the title after his side saw off the challenge of @entity164 last season			0
@entity5 has been there before and although his loyalty to @entity18 remains rock - solid , there were signs on saturday that there is some genuine affection for @entity40			1
@entity172 pokes home @entity40 's equaliser after a shot from team - mate @entity176 @entity176 and @entity172 celebrate following the @entity178 's goal just before half time he agreed with the reaction of @entity40 's dressing room â€” they were convinced they should have won this game			1
@entity5 's assessment was about right			1
' in terms of chances in the first half , @entity40 were the stronger team and possession-wise in the second half , ' he said			2
' the result is probably better for @entity18 in terms of the league			2
we were in the dressing room there feeling that we probably might have won the game			0
' it kind of leaves a nice balance			0
you lose that game and some people would write you off			0
this keeps the league ticking over			0
' the race is on and you are talking about the two best teams in the country			0

@entity5 returned to @entity2 with @entity40
the midfielder left @entity18 last *summer* after 13 years with the club
@entity5 would n't deny that there is an issue between with @entity4
but @entity5 *insists* he is still close with the @entity18 manager
city are still five points behind leaders @entity18 after saturday 's 1 - 1 draw
