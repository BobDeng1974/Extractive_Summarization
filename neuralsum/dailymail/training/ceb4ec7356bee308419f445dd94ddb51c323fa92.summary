they are known as being among the most dangerous predators in the world , but these four lions were left with their tails between their legs after they were brought down a peg or two by a brave mongoose			1

photographer @entity15 came across the scene in the @entity17 , in @entity18 , after spotting the four young lions surrounding the terrified marsh mongoose			1
the mongoose finally managed to escape from the predators into a nearby hole , but remarkably re-emerged to re-engage the confused cats			2
mr @entity15 , 54 , from @entity41 , in @entity42 , said : ' she was watching out for the lions that were still around			1
' then against all odds , she ran out of her hiding place and the fight resumed			0
why did she take this risk ? impossible to know			0
' but she was still fighting fiercely			0
in some way , the confrontation changed			0
the lions seemed confused , uncertain what to do			2
' after bewildering the lions further , the mongoose made its final escape into a covered area unscathed and the predators were left to lick their wounds			2
the mongoose finally managed to escape from the predators into a nearby hole however , it remarkably re-emerged to re-engage the confused cats mr @entity15 said : ' of course i was sure at this time that the mongoose would not escape this fight			1
' the most extraordinary part of this sequence is the fierce defence of the mongoose and how its determination made it possible for it to face its opponents and eventually escape			0
