in the crucial run - up to @entity11 , the @entity9 company shifted 700,000 handsets a day worldwide , selling 60million in the final three months of 2012			1
@entity13 sold 47.8million iphones in the same period – a disappointing figure that saw more than £ 35billion wiped from its stock market value			1
even though sales rose to record levels , @entity13 missed its targets – causing its shares to plunge by more than 10 per cent in one day			1
over just three months , profits from @entity1 ’s smartphone and tablet computer division more than doubled to £ 3.2billion			1
one in three smartphones sold globally in 2012 was made by the company , according to @entity27			0
@entity13 , which is based in @entity28 , produced one in five and lost number one spot			2
the @entity31 and the @entity32 have been battling for supremacy after launches last year – with analysts saying the former ’s screen size – 4.8in to 4in – was a key advantage			0
the new @entity7 also costs more – up to £ 700 if bought outside a pay - monthly contract compared with £ 500 for the @entity5			0
smartphones : @entity1 has the success of its @entity5 smartphone to thank for soaring profits industry experts claim @entity13 has become too focused on high - end , high - cost products that consumers can not – or do not want to – pay for			1
and with the fastest - growing smartphone market shifting to developing economies , the pressure on price will increase even more			0
shares in @entity13 fell again yesterday , and the company has now lost £ 40billion from its market value following its downbeat financial announcement on wednesday night			1
‘ while there is no suggestion that the @entity13 success story is over it is likely that the company will have to run that much faster to stand still , ’ said analyst @entity56 from @entity58 @entity57			2
‘ it faces increasing competition from its rivals like @entity1 , @entity66 and @entity67 , meaning the runaway gains of recent years could well be a thing of the past			0
’ rival : @entity5 models outsold @entity13 's smaller , pricier iphones for the whole of 2012 , figures show in a statement , @entity1 said the ‘ furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone market last year ’ would be tempered by ‘ intensifying price competition ’ and a ‘ slew of new products ’			1
the company ’s profits between october and december rose 86 per cent to a record £ 5.2billion , with revenues rising 19 per cent to £ 32.7billion			2

‘ smartphone shipments will continue to grow , even in the traditionally weak first quarter , ’ he concluded			0
earlier this week – on the same day @entity13 posted its poor results – @entity1 became the global leader in microchip orders			1
