for desperate @entity4 families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy , there is only one place to go			1
those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in @entity12 , one of @entity4 's fastest - growing cities , which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital			1
the community has become known as the ' brain paralysis village ' , as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children , according to a report on @entity29			1
father and daughters : village resident @entity32 ( middle ) and his twin daughters , who were born in 2011 hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of ¥ 100 ( £ 10.6 ) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby @entity39 is completely free , as it is funded by a government scheme			1
roughly 10 kilometres from the @entity42 , the village has formed spontaneously , as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central @entity4			1
the free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems			2
@entity32 , 43 , is one of the many parents living in this village			1
both of his twin daughters , born in 2011 , suffer from brain paralysis			0
' i never found out what that really meant , or why it happened , although i spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure , ' said mr @entity32			0
' in the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in april last year i managed to get taken in here			2
i had almost run out of hope , but the community gave me back my hope			0
' mr @entity32 came to the village with ¥ 1,000 ( £ 106 ) in his pocket in april 2013			2
although the treatment is free - of - charge , the families still need money to live off			2
now a full - time carer for daughters @entity79 and @entity81 ( not their real names ) without any stable income , mr @entity32 is spending around ¥ 3,000 ( £ 318 ) to support the family 's life in the village			1
he took out a loan of more than ¥ 250,000 ( £ 26,422 ) from various sources , which was spent on seeking care for his daughters , according to another report @entity92			1
road to recovery : both of mr @entity32 's daughters are recovering slowly			0
in the picture , mr @entity32 is dressing his @entity81 while @entity79 is warming up her hands near the fire inside hospital : mother @entity100 is helping her daughter @entity102 with rehabilitation under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre , the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk			1
a month later his second daughter followed suit , and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago			0
mr @entity32 said : ' i am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day			0
it is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance i had to come here			0
' the project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from , but children get rooms and care on - site			2
and with his daughters ' care in hand , @entity32 is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave			0
he said : ' i have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope			0
' treatment in demand : a governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of ' brain paralysis ' in @entity150 in southern @entity4 the village : housing around 100 families , the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with brain paralysis			1
according to @entity29 , the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in @entity150			0
all of the children are classified as critical when they arrive , and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves			0
a government report suggested there are around 20,000 children in @entity150 who are diagnosed with some form of ' brain paralysis ' , but only a small portion of them can afford to be treated properly .			2

village is in the city of @entity12 and houses more than 100 families
parents move there so that seriously ill children can be treated at a nearby hospital
treatment at unique centre is paid for by government funding
one father with sick twins has so far *borrowed* more than £ 26,422 for their rehabilitation
they ended up living on the street and moved to the village in desperation
but his daughters are now able to walk and perform basic tasks
