by @entity0 first ladies are not elected officeholders but they should still use their positions of power to effect positive change , @entity1 said on wednesday			1
after all , they are smarter than their politician husbands , she claimed			0
speaking at a symposium for spouses at the @entity13 - @entity12 , @entity1 noted that whether first ladies ' like it or not we are role models ' for young women in their country and they have a ' responsibility to show them the way			1
' ' so we ca n’t waste this spotlight			0
it is temporary and life is short , and change is needed			0
and women are smarter than men , ' she stated to laughter and applause from the mostly female audience			1
' that just goes without saying , ' the event 's moderator , @entity30 of @entity32 , lightheartedly responded			2
' and the men ca n’t complain , because you ’re outnumbered today , ' @entity1 replied with a smile			1
the leading ladies held a similar symposium last summer in @entity46			0
' last year you were still getting blowback about your bangs , ' @entity30 said at the start of wednesday 's program , teasing @entity1			1
' yes , that ’s over , ' the first lady told her			2
' that ’s an important issue , ' @entity55 said in jest			0
the three women went on to discuss a range of issues , from the first ladies ' passion projects , to the important of treating young girls and women with respect			1
referencing a speech she gave last week to young @entity68 leaders , @entity1 said she ' wanted to just implant that notion ' that they ' have to approach their work with a whole new attitude			1
' ' and one of the things i asked the young men is that you have to be introspective and ask yourselves whether you truly believe that women can be your equal			1
' ' until we prioritize our girls and understand that they are as important and their education is as important as the education of our sons , then we will have lots of work to do , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity1 later argued that women of the world have to ' fight for our girls			1
' ' there should never be a girl in this world who has to fear getting educated			0
that should be something that is intolerable to all of us , ' she said , referring to @entity94 , the young girl who was shot by the @entity95 on her way to school in 2012			2
the first lady said that when she looks around the world at young women , she sees her daughters			1
and like her daughters , @entity1 said she wants those young women to have happy , healthy lives			1
' but it 's going to take leadership like us , women like us speaking up in our countries and making sure that young girls are not subject to abuse , and that they are loved and valued , ' she said			1
' and until we do that , we will not solve these problems			0
' ' investing in our women , ' she said , ' is the most important work that we do			1
' ' until we start to value women and girls , we will continue to struggle on this planet , ' she added @entity1 said she chose to focus her women 's initiative on @entity68 because it is an ' under - valued , under - appreciated continent			1
' drawing on recent remarks that ' blood of @entity68 ' runs through her veins , ' @entity1 explained that another motivating factor is her heritage			1
' the importance of @entity68 is very personal to me because , as the president said last night in his toast , @entity68 is home for us , ' she said			1
' his family is there			0
we have visited the continent on several occasions			2
we have taken our daughters back to his grandfather ’s village and they have seen a part of themselves			0
' so the partnership with this continent means a great deal to us , ' she stressed			2
first lady @entity1 and former first lady @entity41 held a conversation on the need to invest in the futures of young girls and women at the @entity13 - @entity12 yesterday in @entity154 the two women had a similar symposium in @entity46 last summer			1
on wednesday they also discussed the importance of changing attitudes and behaviors toward women and girls , as well the discussion was moderated by @entity32 's @entity30 , right , who teased that the last time they all got together @entity1 was mired in a controversy over her new bangs the first lady also used the symposium to talk about another issue she 's been on the front lines of : childhood obesity			1
@entity30 joked that @entity1 's daughters , @entity173 and @entity174 , must tease their mother about the name of her let 's move healthy eating and exercise initiative from time to time			1
' i must say , with teenage daughters			0
i would suspect that sometimes they say to you , let ’s move , mom			0
' ' yes , you ’ve been sitting at our dining room table , @entity30 ? ' @entity1 said			2
' well , you know , every teenager has a little smart aleck in them , it ’s true			0
' turning serious , @entity1 said that she and her husband have found that their children really do listen to them			2
' they take on these new messages even when we do n’t think they ’re paying attention			0
' ' and that ’s one of the things that we try to tell parents , ' she said , ' you do n’t know that they ’re listening , but i see how my children make different decisions about what they eat now as teenagers now that they have control because they have the information about how food affects their overall health and their ability to perform			0
' the event was part of a portion of the summit for spouses			0
after the conservation @entity1 dined with several first spouses of @entity68 countries , including the first lady of @entity46 @entity228 , who sat to her left @entity30 noted that despite having the best of intentions , @entity1 has ' gotten some blowback ' over her campaign			1
' i know that you both get into these things and you ’re doing them for the good of the country , and suddenly you get criticized for it			2
and it must just be such a shock in a way , ' she said , addressing both @entity243 and @entity55			0
' well , i was not that shocked , ' @entity55 told her			0
after having watched her husband 's parents ' experience in the @entity247 from afar , @entity55 said she was prepared ' to be characterized in a way that you are n’t , really			0
' ' and so i do n’t think it was any big surprise to me , ' she said			0
' that does n’t make it any less hurtful			0
' @entity1 backed her @entity254 counterpart up , saying her take on criticism directed at the first family is ' absolutely true			2
' ' and that ’s really the role of leadership , ' she said			0
' it ’s not about amassing power ; it ’s taking some of those hits and continuing to do the work , even when it ’s painful and sometimes unappreciated			0
' that is why it 's important for first ladies to stay focused on their ' vision , ' she said			2
' because if you have your vision and you know what you ’re passionate about , and you know what direction you ’re going in , then all of the arrows and the spears and the criticisms			1
. they bounce off of you because you keep doing the work every day			1
' they might pinch a little bit , ' @entity1 said			2
' you might get shot in the eye			0
' you just sort of go to the doctor , patch yourself up and get back in the game , ' she said .			0

the first lady also *questioned* whether young @entity68 men ' truly believe that women can be your equal '
@entity1 said she 's focused her *outreach* to girls on @entity68 because the continent ' is very personal to me . . . @entity68 is home for us '
the first lady admitted it 's hurtful to be criticized for the work she does on behalf of the country but said it comes with the *territory*
' all of the arrows and the spears and the criticisms . . they bounce off of you because you keep doing the work every day , ' she said
