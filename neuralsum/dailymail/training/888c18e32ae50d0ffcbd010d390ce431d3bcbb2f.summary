the timing starts from the moment they enter the car park to the second they leave			2
it means they are expected to park , read the sign , get a trolley , go into the shop and exit all within the ten - minute limit			1
customers are expected to finish in just 60 minutes or face a £ 90 fine			1
the recently refurbished @entity0 , in @entity47 , put up the signs earlier this month but the scheme only went live last weekend			2
local resident @entity50 , 51 , called the new system ‘ extortionate ’			0
‘ the camera takes the time from entering the car park , so if you ’re disabled and in a wheelchair , you would almost certainly fall foul of this , ’ she said			2
‘ also even if you were a customer , it would mean significantly less time than an hour to do your shopping , as you need time to pack the car , return the coin - operated trolley , get to your car and exit the car park			2
’ @entity0 , which employs @entity16 to manage all its @entity67 car parks , defended the system which it said ‘ ensures that spaces are available for @entity0 customers to use ’ in ‘ exceptionally busy ’ locations			0
a spokesman at the store said ‘ previous misuse of the car park ’ had meant customers not always being able to park , adding : ‘ the vast majority of our customers are pleased with the implementation of these systems as … they are now able to access parking spaces when carrying out their shopping			1
’ @entity85 president @entity84 has denounced the ‘ cowboy tactics , scaremongering and bullying ’ used by many private parking firms			0

@entity98 , of the @entity99 , said : ‘ private parking companies … making an industry of penalising people without good reason or for their simple human mistakes			0
‘ big brands do n’t seem to appreciate how this new industry operates or the sense of anger and injustice that it produces in its victims and who are also their own customers			0
