by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 8 october 2013 at 92 , the doughty @entity1 is still fiercely independent			1
little wonder , then , that @entity1 recoiled in horror today when showed the latest form of transport for the fashionable pensioner about town			1
the @entity9 ’s husband , who has spent the summer recuperating in @entity10 after abdominal surgery back in june , made clear on a visit to an old peoples ’ home in @entity15 that he is not ready to take up a zimmer frame just yet			1
what 's this ? the sprightly prince @entity1 , who visited the @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity21 , @entity15 , today , looks curiously at the walking frame not for him : the prince - clearly not a fan of the walking frame - recoils in horror walking aids aside , @entity1 was clearly in high spirits as he toured the @entity20 ’s @entity19 in the market town of @entity21 , @entity15			1
at 92 , he was older than many of its elderly residents , but still managed to show off his infamously sharp sense of humour when he joked about a toddler being knocked off an inflatable toy			1
@entity1 made the aside as he was taken to an activity class and watched as a group of elderly women , sitting in a semi-circle , kicked large inflatable balls around the room at breakneck speed			1
meet and greet : @entity1 meets a resident - most of whom were younger than the 92 - year - old prince all smiles : @entity1 showed off his quirky sense of humour during the trip - one of his first since taking two months leave following surgery standing in the doorway , the prince remarked : ‘ this is dangerous ’			1
he then spotted 22 - month - old @entity54 , whose great - grandmother @entity55 , 93 , was taking part in the class , sitting on an inflatable ball and asked : ‘ do you get bonus points if you knock her off ? ’ afterwards the prince turned to @entity63 , manager of the residential block where the class was held and enquired : ‘ health and safety people ? ’			2
‘ health and safety goes out the window , ’ she joked			2
fortunately , said staff , all of those present took @entity1 ’s remarks in their stride			1
‘ everyone thought it was very funny and no - one was offended in the slightest			2
it was really quite funny , ’ said one			0
activities assistant @entity79 , who was leading the class , added : ‘ this is gentle exercise to stimulate parts of the body that are not used too often , they really enjoy it			0
’ ‘ i think the @entity1 wanted to join in , to be honest			2
he looks brilliant for his age			0
’ during his tour of the £ 4 million centre , which opened last november , the prince also watched residents playing indoor bowls and a performance by a troupe of eye - catching young performers from the @entity96			1
fun and games : the @entity45 watched residents as they exercise by kicking inflatable balls around the room having a ball : @entity1 observed the football - like game and joked that participants would get bonus points for knocking this little girl off her ball viewed by some as ' refreshingly open ' but by others as somewhat politically incorrect , prince @entity1 , pictured waving to the cameras today right , has always possessed a propensity to shock			1
in 1986 he told @entity114 students in @entity115 : ' if you stay here much longer you 'll all be slitty - eyed			2
' seven years later , he told a @entity119 living in @entity120 : ' you ca n't have been here long			0
you 've not got a pot belly			0
' his remarks apparently alluded to the @entity120 ' love of food and drink			0
closer to home , he caused a storm while touring a factory in @entity130 in august 1999 when he remarked that a fuse box ' looked as though it had been put in by an @entity132 '			0
again in @entity10 , he outraged locals when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in @entity136 in 1995 : ‘ how do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them past the test ? '			0
his other foot - in - mouth remarks include telling a group of teenagers from the @entity145 in @entity146 who were standing near a loud @entity149 steel band : ' if you 're near that music it 's no wonder you 're deaf			2
' some of his off - the - cuff remarks have proved more amusing , however			0
when asked if he knew the @entity153 , off the coast of @entity155 , he joked : ‘ yes , my son owns them			0
’ and of his daughter , @entity158 , he jested : ‘ if it does n't fart or eat hay , she is not interested			0
' but last year when @entity1 , pictured above signing portraits today , caused a bit of a stir on a @entity166 visit to @entity167 in @entity168 with the @entity9 when he spotted pretty @entity169 , 25 , in an eye - catching peplum - style red dress which had a zip running the length of its front			1
‘ i would get arrested if i unzipped that dress ! ’ he exclaimed			0
while @entity169 , an @entity178 graduate who works for @entity179 as a schools and transport co-ordinator , retained her composure , an unnamed policeman just fell about in a heap of giggles as the prince moved on			0
senior royal sources insist that the prince does n’t mean to shock but has a mischievous sense of humour - which he likes to use to put people who might be nervous at meeting royalty at ease			0
before leaving , @entity1 officially opened the @entity194 accommodation centre where the activities session was held			2
and to mark the occasion , the residents had produced a printed cotton quilt of advice and sayings for the @entity1 to take for @entity202 - wisdom from 2,399 accumulated years of life			1
a message to the royal baby from one resident , identified only by his first name @entity208 , was ‘ keep your nose clean ’ , while @entity209 wrote ‘ find your own way in life			0
’ the heartfelt words were accompanied by pictures the contributors liked , from countryside images to @entity219 aircraft , reflecting the military service of some of the residents			0
as @entity1 made his way to his car , he met residents from a nursing accommodation block who had been patiently waiting to greet him			1
they were wrapped up in blankets as they sat in their wheelchairs and waved @entity232 flags and red , white and blue balloons			0
@entity234 and old : the @entity1 met pupils of the @entity96 during his 45 - minute tour present : @entity1 was given a quilt containing advice for @entity202 from one of the female pensioners @entity241 , 88 , a former butcher , said he supplied meat to @entity243 , the ancestral home of the @entity245 family where @entity246 , @entity247 grew up			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 looks just like he does on the telly			2
when i was butcher i met @entity252 and @entity253 - they were always fighting each other			2
’ @entity1 was admitted to @entity255 in early june – his fourth hospitalisation in just 18 months – where he underwent what @entity257 described as an ‘ exploratory operation following abdominal investigations ’			1
he was released 10 days later and although staff have refused to discuss the result of the tests citing medical confidentiality , they made clear he would require at least two months recuperation			0
after retiring to recover at the @entity9 ’s residences at @entity268 and @entity269 , @entity1 flew up to @entity10 but now plans to embark on a full programme of public engagements of up to 300 engagements a year			1
on the mend : @entity1 was taken to the @entity275 clinic in early june - his fourth hospitalisation in 18 months - for the procedure and was released 10 days later			1

sprightly @entity45 recoiled in horror at site of a walking frame on visit today
@entity1 , 92 , back on full - time public *duties* following two months leave after exploratory abdominal surgery
