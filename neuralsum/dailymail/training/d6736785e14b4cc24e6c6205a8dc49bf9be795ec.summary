by @entity1 reporter published : 08:58 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 21:35 est , 27 august 2012 a little girl who developed kidney failure after twice battling cancer made a miracle recovery after her organ healed itself			1
@entity7 has now been cancer - free for five years - and the landmark date means it is unlikely to return			1
the nine - year - old had a kidney removed after her first brush with cancer and then the remaining kidney failed after she had intensive treatment to battle the cancer a second time			1
but doctors were startled when the organ began to heal itself			2
recovered : @entity7 , 9 , ( left and aged four , right ) has been cancer - free for five years			1
she was on kidney dialysis for 18 months before her organ seemed to heal itself @entity7 is now the picture of health and her parents @entity26 and @entity28 , from @entity29 , are planning a big party to celebrate the end of a very traumatic time			1
@entity26 , 34 , who works as a pharmacy dispenser , said : ' i told her " you have beaten both the cancers that were there and i do n’t think they will come back " , but i still do n’t think she fully understands what a big deal this is			2
' it ’s just wonderful			2
' @entity7 was first diagnosed aged just two , when experts detected a @entity45 ’ tumour , a rare form of cancer found inside a kidney			1
it appeared she was recovering well after having the kidney removed and four months ’ of chemotherapy , but a routine check - up 10 months later revealed the disease had returned			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' she was diagnosed again on the day after i had had her sister @entity55 , who is now five , and when they said " it ’s back " our whole world collapsed			2
' for a year we were all practically living on the ward at the @entity60			0
and this cancer was a mixture of two types of cancer which they had never seen happen before			2
@entity7 ( left ) with her parents and younger sister @entity55			2
@entity7 was first diagnosed with a tumour aged two ' it was a total newbie so they held lots of meetings to decide on her treatment - they had to get it right so we did n’t mind , and it means they can use this course of treatment if it happens to anyone else			1
' from a mum ’s point of view it was awful and i just wished i could swap places			0
there were times when she was very , very poorly			0
' she had 10 months of chemotherapy and they really blasted her to make sure they killed all the bad cells , and there were some awful side effects			0
' she developed mucositis , which stripped the lining of her throat and mouth so badly she could n’t talk , and she lost her fingernails , toenails and her hair , and that bit she found very hard - not a very confident little girl at all			0
@entity7 , 9 , ( right ) pictured with little sister @entity55 has one functioning kidney ' we had pink bandanas for her but people used to mistake her for a boy , which really used to upset her			1
' to add insult to injury after the intensive treatment , @entity7 ’s remaining kidney failed , leading to her having dialysis for 18 months			1
@entity26 was ready to donate one of hers when doctors found @entity7 's kidney was functioning again and since then she has n’t looked back			1
two trips away without @entity26 or @entity28 , 41 , a roofer - one to @entity122 and one to @entity123 - have further boosted her confidence			0
and from now , @entity7 only needs to take medication for her kidney and a nightly growth hormone injection			1
she also only needs to visit the @entity128 at the @entity60 once a year , but her mum has opted for six - monthly visits for now , for extra reassurance			0
@entity26 said : ' it is a mum thing			0
i am not ready yet to go once a year , so i want her to be checked over more regularly			0
' sometimes i have to remind myself that i am the mum because she ’s so much more grown - up than other nine - year - olds and so blase about the whole thing			0
' it is her 10th birthday in september and we are going to have a big party with all our friends and family who have gone through this with us			0
' she is a little miracle			0

@entity7 had one kidney removed during first battle with cancer . second kidney failed after treatment for second bout of the disease
