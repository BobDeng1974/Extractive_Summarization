by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 31 july 2013 a couple used the ' caveman ' diet to win a mammoth weight loss bet at 100 - 1 with bookmakers who paid out after they lost more than 10 stone			1
@entity8 , 32 , staked £ 50 at 100 - 1 that he and girlfriend @entity9 , 29 , could lose a massive 10 stone in six months and they landed the bet to win £ 5,000 after a healthy eating and exercise regime saw the couple dropping from a combined 40st 12lbs to 30st 6lbs			1
bookmakers @entity16 take about a 100 bets a year on weight loss , but no pair of gamblers have lost more than 10 stone before , so the couple have made punting history after being offered the longest ever odds			1
partners @entity8 and @entity9 put a bet on themselves to lose weight and won £ 5,000 from @entity16 when they lost 10 stone between them the pair , from @entity30 , @entity31 , decided to lose the equivalent of a third person ahead of their marriage after civil servant @entity8 popped the question to @entity37 - born @entity9 last december			1
strapping 6ft tall @entity8 , who weighed 23st 3lbs when he placed the bet and now tips the scales at 17st 2lbs , said : ' i had tried diets and exercise in the past to lose weight , but it had never worked and at one point ahead of placing the bet i was up to 25 stone			1
' then i read a story about a man who won a bet with @entity16 after losing a few stone and decided that we could do it and the £ 5,000 would be a great incentive and could go towards our wedding and a holiday			1
' we 've been together 10 years and it 's easy just to get into a comfort zone			2
i was probably about 17st when we met and now i 'd like to get down to 14st or even 13st			0
but it goes on a lot easier than it comes off			0
once i put the bet on i was n't going to lose it , ' bookmakers @entity16 , who accept around 100 bets on weightloss each year , offered the couple odds of 100 - 1 and paid out when @entity8 and @entity9 slimmed down @entity8 added : ' i knew it was a big challenge , but with healthy eating and starting to take exercise i knew we could do it			1
we went on the caveman diet and cut out carbs and alcohol			0
i 've just done the @entity79 and a year ago i could n't even run round the block			0
' i go out running with my younger brother @entity81 , 27 , and he keeps telling me there is more in your legs , so i do n't give up			0
i do a boot camp at the weekends and a cardiovascular work out session can see me burning 1,200 calories per hour			0
' i 've not had an alcoholic drink for four months and before this i 'd have about 10 pints on a night out and a couple of bottles of white wine			1
' i 've got a season ticket at @entity94 and after the match i go for a @entity96 now , but the lads all know about the weight loss and there 's been no peer pressure to have a drink at all			2
' i 've won a few hundred on the football and the golf before , but this is my biggest ever win by a long way and the weight loss is priceless			2
' the couple decided to change their lifestyle after getting engaged and will now put their winnings towards their wedding mother - of - two @entity9 , a fellow civil servant who hails from @entity37 , who went from 17st 9lbs to 13st 4lbs , said : ' i checked with the doctor that we were okay to take on the bet and we have changed our whole way of life with more exercise and healthy eating			1
' @entity8 is the chef and he 's put us both on the @entity120 - where we do n't eat carbs and have increased our exercise			2
' we 've grown together , but we now have two daughters @entity125 , aged three , and 10 - month - old @entity126 and we do n't want to be big unfit parents unable to play with our children			2
' we got engaged before @entity129 and then we struck the bet to get extra incentive for our wedding - i was n't going to get married being overweight			1
we 've tried lots of diets in the past , but striking that bet was the best incentive			2
when @entity16 accepted our bet they changed our lives			1
' @entity16 's spokesman @entity140 said : ' this is a record - breaking first for @entity16 as we 've never had any couple land such a heavy - weight punt at 100 - 1 on their weight loss			1
' when @entity9 called to say they had succeeded we were flabbergasted , this is an amazing achievement and they deserve their winnings			1
' breakfast : nothing , instead would get to work and snack on a can of @entity153 ( 130 kcal ) and a bag of crisps or some biscuits ( 200 kcal ) lunch : a @entity158 ( 210 kcal ) , a sandwich ( 500 kcal ) and another bag of crisps ( 200 kcal ) mid afternoon snack : chocolate bar ( 200 kcal ) and another coke ( 130 kcal ) evening meal : more @entity153 or other soft drinks , or wine and beer with a large pizza and chips or @entity171 or @entity172 takeaway ( around 2,500 kcal ) alcohol at the weekends would boost their intake by anything between four or five thousand calories			0
total : around 4,000 calories per day breakfast : strawberries , melon or banana ( 100 kcal each serving ) and a glass of water			0
lunch : a grilled chicken salad ( 350 kcal ) with water			0
cutting out the soft drinks saved thousands of calories each week			0
evening meal : healthy piece of chicken or fish with vegetables and perhaps a piece of fruit for dessert			0
cooking the food himself ensured that @entity8 knew exactly what went into it and their evening meal was rarely more than 750 calories			0
the couple cut out alcohol , white bread and processed food entirely and now snack on fruit , nuts and seeds and drink plenty of water			0
total : around 1,200 calories per day			0

@entity217 *&* @entity9 placed £ 50 bet on themselves to lose weight
