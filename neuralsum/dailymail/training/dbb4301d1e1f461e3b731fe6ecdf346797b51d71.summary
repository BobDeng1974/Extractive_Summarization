by @entity1 reporter published : 19:07 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 3 december 2013 ah , the joys of taking an early morning bath ... at first you might be a bit timid , specially on chilly days such as these			2
but soon you ’re splashing about in the water , getting thoroughly soaked and with a big smile on your beak			2
taking a dip : a blue tit has a bath in @entity13 , @entity14 , yesterday morning @entity15 : water flies up as the little blue tit takes to the pool and maybe your thoughts turn to what you ’ll be having for breakfast – perhaps a nice tasty worm ? but then , disaster			1
as you sit there in all your soaking finery , you realise you ’ve forgotten to put out a towel ... not a problem , of course , for this blue tit pictured by wildlife photographer @entity31 in a pool in the grounds of his rural home in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the little fellow just had to flit about a bit in the winter sunshine and bingo , he was nice and dry again			0
splash : he makes sure that he gives himself a good soaking @entity43 : ... and dunks his head to do the hard to reach bits it is likely that the bird would have been having a brief break from searching for something to eat in mr @entity31 's garden			1
the birds are particularly common in woodland , hedgerows and parks across the @entity55 all year round			0
the @entity56 estimates that there are around 15 million blue tits in the @entity55 between october and march			0
in all there are up to 44 million blue tits in @entity61 .			0

the bird was pictured splashing about in @entity13 , @entity14 , yesterday morning
the *charming* wintery scene was captured by @entity31 in his rural garden
