by @entity0 next time someone winks at you , they may not be flirting - instead they could be controlling a tiny pc fitted inside their ear that is tracking their facial movements			1
the device , called @entity12 - type @entity11 pc , was built at @entity13 , weighs 17g , and is fitted with @entity14 , a compass , gyro - sensor , speaker and microphone			1
it uses infrared sensors that monitor tiny movements inside the ear and can recognise every time a wearer 's eyes and mouth move			2
it weighs 17g and is fitted with gps , compass , gyro - sensor , speaker and microphone			1
it can be connected to any bluetooth - enabled device , and can be programmed to register a range of facial movements the device , called @entity12 - type @entity11 pc , was built at @entity13 , weighs 17g , and is fitted with @entity14 , compass , gyro - sensor , speaker and microphone			1
it uses infrared sensors that monitor tiny movements inside the ear and can track every time a wearer 's eyes and mouth move			2
it can be connected to any bluetooth - enabled device and can be programmed to register certain movements			0
for example , a wearer could scroll through menus by winking , or open a programme by sticking out their tongue or clenching their teeth			0

the clip was created by engineer @entity29 from the university , and its design was inspired simplicity by @entity79 @entity78 flower arrangements , also known as kado or ‘ way of flowers			1
’ the technology is reminiscent of the in - ear computer worn by @entity85 in the 2013 film her			1
in the film , @entity89 's character @entity88 falls in love with an operating system with a female voice @entity29 calls his device ‘ a third hand ’ that could be used by rockclimbers , hikers , cyclists and other athletes , as well as people with disabilities			2
‘ supposing i climb a mountain , look at the sky at night and see a bright star up there , it could tell me what it is , ’ @entity29 told @entity102			0
‘ as it knows what altitude i 'm at , which direction i 'm looking and at what angle , it could tell me , ' the bright star you are seeing now is @entity115			0
’ ” an engineer from @entity78 machinery maker @entity117 holds a prototype @entity119 connected to a smartphone			0
the clip is fitted with a pulse meter and thermometer and future versions of the device could be used to monitor the wearer 's health , for example the clip is battery - powered and comes with built - in storage , meaning users can upload software , apps and files to their ear - worn chip			1
it is also fitted with a pulse monitor and thermometer , which @entity29 claims makes the device perfect for keeping an eye - or ear - on your health			1
for example , future versions could be used as a hearing aid , could log changes in pulse and temperature , track how often the wearer eats by monitoring mouth movements , or even how often they sneeze			1
the design of the clip was said to have been inspired by @entity79 @entity78 flower arrangements , also known as kado or ' way of flowers			0
' an example freestyle arrangement is pictured the technology is reminiscent of the in - ear computer worn by @entity85 in the 2013 film her			1
in the film , @entity89 's character @entity88 falls in love with an operating system with a female voice this information could then be sent to a doctor or relative			0
equally , the built - in accelerometer can tell if a person has fallen over			2
if they do n’t get back up within a certain time , @entity29 ’s device could be programmed to automatically alert a neighbour or relative , or call an ambulance			2
they would be able to locate the clip and wearer using gps data			0
‘ we have made this with the basic idea that people will wear it in the same way they wear earrings , ’ continued @entity29			0
tests are currently being carried out in @entity188			0
developers hope the device will be ready to go on sale to select people by @entity193 and general sale from april 2016 .			1

the clip weighs 17g and is fitted with @entity14 , a gyro - sensor and microphone
wearers can control the pc using eye , ear and mouth movements
*dubbed* @entity12 - type @entity11 pc , the device also has built - in storage
it was created by engineer @entity29 of @entity210
future models will track a wearer ’s health and send an alert if they fall over
it is currently *undergoing* trials and is *due* to go on sale by april 2016
