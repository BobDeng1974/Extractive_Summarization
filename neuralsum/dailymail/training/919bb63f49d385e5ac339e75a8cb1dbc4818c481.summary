this burned out battery is what has caused a worldwide grounding of @entity5 ’s ‘ revolutionary ’ 787 dreamliner jets			1
photographs of the charred remains of lithium ion batteries from two separate incidents resulting in the grounding of @entity12 @entity11 indicate it operated at a voltage above its design limit			1
today @entity17 officials joined @entity12 's probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the world have been stopped from flying			1
concerns over the battery , prompted by an emergency landing of an @entity49 plane on wednesday , has seen the plane grounded across the globe			1
the @entity17 investigators - one each from the @entity53 and the @entity54 and two from @entity5 - today inspected the @entity49 jet on the tarmac at @entity58 in western @entity12			1
an initial inspection by @entity12 officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as electrolyte had leaked from the plane 's main lithium - ion battery beneath the cockpit			1
it also found burn marks around the battery			2
eight airlines fly the ‘ plastic plane ’ , so - called because its fuselage is ‘ spun ’ from super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre , which cuts weight and fuel consumption , rather than constructed from aluminium			2
grounded : passengers are forced to evacuate a @entity12 @entity27 using the plane 's escape slides following an emergency landing at @entity58 yesterday @entity12 's two largest air carriers all @entity81 and @entity82 voluntarily grounded their 787s following the emergency landing at @entity58 airport a @entity12 all @entity86 was forced to make an emergency landing after a cockpit message warned of battery problems what are the problems with the new @entity27 ? the 21st - century plane entered service in october 2011 , three years late , following a spate of design and safety - related issues			1
what are the safety issues ? of foremost concern is the aircraft 's lithium battery system			1
lithium technology , which is used in electric cars and laptops , is considered potentially unsafe and has been known to start fires			0
what were the other problems ? the first three 787s were found to be overweight			0
there were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the development of the on board software			0
test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and @entity116 was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time			0
in june 2010 @entity5 stunned the aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after engineers discovered structural flaws			1
then in november that year a test flight had to make an emergency landing in @entity125 , @entity126 , after crew notice smoke in the cabin			0
are they safe ? @entity5 insists they are but is reviewing the plane 's design and assembly together with the @entity53			1
the company issued a statement saying they stand behind the 787 's overall integrity			2
chief executive @entity136 said in a statement			0
' we will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the travelling public of the 787 's safety and to return the airplanes to service			2
' what does it mean for @entity5 ? @entity5 shares fell 2 per cent on wednesday and are expected to fall further			1
some experts have suggested the 787 , which has a list price of $ 207 million , may never make a profit			2
the manufacturer faces stiff competition from @entity155 firm @entity154 who build the @entity157 , the world 's largest passenger aircraft			1
why have airlines rushed to buy the 787 ? the @entity27 has the longest range of any passenger jet			2
more significantly it is the most efficient , this is vitally important as fuel costs now represent airlines ' largest expenditure			0
passenger comfort is also paramount with bigger windows , more room for carry - on baggage , and lower cabin pressurisation to make long flights more bearable			0
787s also have wider aisles and higher ceilings and offer a smoother , quieter journey			0
@entity176 has ordered 24 and holiday firm @entity177 has ordered 8 of the planes – with their deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the stricken airliner			0
@entity177 is scheduled to be the first @entity182 flyer of @entity11 in may			2
@entity183 , the maker of the lithium - ion batteries used in the 787s , said thursday it was helping with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear			0
it said the problem could be the battery , the power source or the electronics system			2
@entity155 air safety bosses acted just hours after @entity17 ’s @entity53 ( @entity53 ) issued an ‘ @entity193 ’ to halt flights of the planes - the first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 years			1
the @entity53 ’s emergency directive said the action was ‘ prompted by recent incidents involving lithium ion battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes , heat damage and smoke ’ on two aircraft			1
’ it said : ’ the cause of these failures is currently under investigation ’ but warned more ominously : ’ these conditions , if not corrected , could result in damage to critical systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment			0
’ the decision to ground the 50 planes currently in service is a humiliating blow to the world ’s biggest aircraft maker , which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ana jet emergency landing on wednesday			1
some 137 passengers and crew members on an @entity230 flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on board			0
the @entity27 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			0
they charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
but the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity , so as it spreads it can cause short - circuits and ignite fires			0
its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane			0
@entity249 , professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at @entity251 said : ‘ unfortunately , what @entity5 did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the electric cars , and they are running into the same problems with the 787 as the problems that have shown up in electric cars			1
’ the battery fire is just one of a series of problems - including two fuel leaks , a wiring problem , brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late			1
the plane made the landing in @entity58 after a burning smell was also detected in the cockpit			0
both all @entity81 and @entity82 have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft both @entity12 and the @entity17 have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns among the 50 planes grounded are the six @entity11 owned by @entity281 , the only @entity17 airline to operate the plane			1
the @entity284 government also ordered @entity285 to ground its fleet of six 787s			0
the two @entity11 owned by @entity289 ’s @entity288 were also grounded alongside the 24 in @entity12			1
on wednesday a @entity291 airlines 787 flight from @entity295 ’s @entity294 airport was also cancelled ahead of the global grounding			2
all will be subject to strict safety tests before being allowed to take off again			0
plunge : shares in @entity5 have fallen by 6.3 per cent over the last two days wiping an estimated $ 2.7 billion off the company 's stock market value @entity136 , @entity5 's chairman , president and ceo , said the company is working with the @entity53 to resolve the situation as quickly as possible			1
' we are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity , ' he said in a statement			0
' we will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787 's safety and to return the airplanes to service			2
' @entity315 , chief engineer on the 787 , said last week that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			1
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk '			0
members of the press are shown the @entity27 's innovative led lighting system , which was designed to reduce jet lag during a tour of the aircraft in february 2012			2
