by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 knows from bitter personal experience that the agony of failure at the @entity6 can be hard to cleanse from your system			1
he has suffered it four times in his career , from the pain of missing out through injury in 2002 , to the penalty shoot - out misery in @entity17 in 2006 and a crushing defeat at the hands of arch - rivals @entity20 in @entity22 four years later			1
the disappointing performance of @entity25 ’s team this summer in @entity26 is still raw			0
they are out after two games ; the first time @entity30 have failed to progress beyond the group stage of the @entity6 since 1958 , and their shortest campaign since 1950			1
there will be no @entity6 glory for the 34 - year - old @entity42 captain but he believes the young players in @entity25 ’ s squad , many of whom are at their first major tournament , will learn from the experience			1
' it ’s a difficult one , ' said @entity2			1
' @entity50 is a level where you do n’t forget your experiences in two weeks , four weeks or a couple of months			0
' they live with you for a long time			0
' you have to accept that and try and move forward so that , if you ’re picked for another tournament , your experiences are better			0
clean slate : it 's been a couple of months to forget for the @entity42 and @entity30 skipper @entity62 : @entity63 and @entity64 are set to start against @entity65 ' i do think the youngsters here have that character			2
i ’ve said how talented they are			0
they do the right things in and around training and they want to stay at this level for a long time			0
' it will be better in two years because of the standard of players we have here			0
' some of those young players will be given their first taste of @entity6 football in @entity82 tomorrow when @entity30 contest their final @entity84 fixture against @entity65 , who need only a point to win the group			1
@entity88 ’s teenage full - back @entity64 and young @entity89 midfielder @entity63 are both expected to start , as is @entity90			2
@entity2 will take a rest and @entity92 will captain the team .			2

@entity2 knows from experience the agony of @entity6 *heartache*
missed 2002 through injury and suffered *deflating* exits in 2006 and 2010
@entity30 have failed to progress beyond group stage for first time since 1958
