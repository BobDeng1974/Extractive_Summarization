speaking to guests at the reception , the @entity0 added : ' i believe credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans			1
' they can encourage those who have the means to save , and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans			0
' the simple fact is that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts , they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them			0
