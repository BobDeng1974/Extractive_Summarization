@entity0 has promised to abolish a helpline set up by the @entity2 for flood victims which charges a premium rate of up to 41p a minute for calls			1
after the high cost of dialling the helpline came to light yesterday , the prime minister ’s spokesman said the 0845 number would be phased out later this year			1
the @entity12 number costs 10.5p a minute from landlines and could be as much as 41p from a mobile			1
the aim of the service is to give details of flood warnings and advice			2
the @entity2 had claimed the 0845 prefix was used because there was no other number available			1
bad weather : flood victims are being forced to pay up to 41p - a - minute to call a premium rate government helpline a @entity28 @entity27 car had to be rescued from floodwaters in @entity30 near @entity31 today after stalling on the flooded road shocking : according to the @entity2 's website , although there is a freephone number for reporting incidents , anyone needing help or advice must pay a premium rate however , yesterday amid the outcry , it set up an alternative helpline on a cheaper 0345 number , which costs the same as calling a landline			1
the government has come under repeated criticism for choosing the expensive @entity50 numbers for helplines			2
mr @entity0 also played down the suggestion from @entity2 boss @entity53 that only ‘ town or country ’ could be protected from flooding , because it is difficult to do both without a ‘ bottomless ’ budget			1
but lord @entity53 – whose officials have been criticised for failing to dredge rivers – added that he ‘ regretted ’ that ‘ we probably have not done as much as we should have ’			1
the cheaper new @entity12 number - 0345 9881188 - has since been released and will operate alongside the existing 0845 number to ensure that people with the old number are still able to get through			1
but the pm 's spokesman insisted it would be axed ' as soon as it can be done '			0
however @entity70 , director of flood and coastal risk management at the @entity2 , told @entity73 's today programme : ' we do n't make any money out of that			1
we have plans in place to switch			0
what we are doing is developing a communications plan , because clearly that number has been in use for some years			0
people have got used to it and they know what number to ring			2
' so there is a plan being developed , has been for some time now , to switch over and we think summer is probably the best time to switch rather than ... the winter period			0
' the phone line offers up to date flood warnings and tips to protect people and homes from water			2
' in a flood it 's important to focus on the safety of you and your family , ' one says			2
' wear waterproof clothing , boots and gloves			0
take food , water , a torch and any essential medication			0
evacuate if told to do so			0
@entity110 and disinfect your property using household cleaners '			0
no let up : flooding in the village of @entity115 , @entity116 , which has been submerged with flood water the news comes as the chairman of the @entity2 said @entity120 may have to choose whether it wants to save ' town or country ' from future flooding because it is too costly to defend both			1
@entity125 , a member of @entity126 's flooding on the @entity127 , told @entity128 : ' it is shocking that hard - pressed flood victims are being charged for this			1
' we are extremely grateful to the @entity2 's people on the ground , who are doing their best to help us			1
' but this is just another example of staggering mismanagement from their pen - pushing bosses '			0
another victim said : ' these people are victims of some of the worst flooding this country has ever seen and are struggling to pay their bills			1
' yet when they need help , they have to pay again			2
it is disgusting and should be changed to a free number immediately			0
' brave : a cyclist on a flooded cycle path by the @entity151 and @entity152 did n't let flooding put him off getting on his bike the premium phone line controversy emerged as the chairman of the @entity2 said ' difficult choices ' would have to be made over what to protect from future flooding because ' there is no bottomless purse ' to pay for defences			1
writing in the @entity163 , lord @entity53 said that ' there are no quick fixes in the face of this kind of extreme rainfall ' , and tough decisions lie ahead about how protection from flooding is managed in the future			1
he added : ' yes , agricultural land matters and we do whatever we can with what we have to make sure it is protected			0
rules from successive governments give the highest priority to lives and homes ; and i think most people would agree that this is the right approach			2
' but this involves tricky issues of policy and priority ; town or country , front rooms or farmland ? ' surfers wait to attempt to ride a rare maximum five star @entity194 at the @entity196 besides the @entity197 yesterday children play in flood water blocking the main @entity200 at @entity201 near @entity202 in @entity126 yesterday following a meeting of the government 's @entity205 yesterday , environment secretary @entity203 said that 73,000 homes in @entity208 had been protected from flooding since friday , and that the @entity2 continued to protect communities by deploying demountable flood defences , sandbags and clearing waterways			1
he said : ' i have enormous sympathy for those who have been affected again this weekend and the government is working with all local councils to help communities recover			2
all requests for assistance have been met			0
' meanwhile householders have been told to brace themselves as further wind and rain threatens to bring more chaos to waterlogged communities across @entity120			0
around 180 homes were flooded during a busy weekend for the emergency services and @entity2 workers up and down the country			1
but as flood - hit communities enjoyed a break in the bad weather yesterday , forecasters warned there may be worse to come , with winds of up to 70mph and up to 30mm of rain expected today			2
further flooding is expected this week as high sea levels , strong winds and large waves continue to wreak havoc in coastal regions			0
and it emerged yesterday that households and businesses across the @entity246 that are cut off by flood water are now in the midst of a crime wave			0
opportunistic thieves are targeting evacuated homes and workplaces , stealing possessions and then escaping by boat			0
looters stole 600 gallons of oil from one farmer and two quad - bikes used by the fire service			0
police are now ramping up their patrols on horseback and by helicopter in a bid to clamp down on the thefts .			0
