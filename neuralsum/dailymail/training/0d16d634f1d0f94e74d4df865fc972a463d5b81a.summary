@entity0 signed his first autograph when he was only 12			1
it had nothing to do with football , though			2
part of a six - strong school quiz team that conquered all - comers in the @entity9 principality of @entity10 , the young @entity0 returned from a subsequent competition in northern @entity12 to find himself unexpectedly popular			1
‘ it was just the younger children at school asking me to sign my name , ’ recalled @entity0 bashfully			1
‘ it was the first time in my life			0
but it was n’t down to me			0
we had two children on the team who were very clever			0
i did my bit , but was more in the background			0
they were the reason we won			0
’ fast forward 14 years and @entity0 has signed his share of autographs			1
ahead of a new season at @entity22 , however , this is no time for the 26 - year - old to be part of a supporting cast			1
if @entity19 ’s revolution at @entity51 is to propel @entity22 back towards the top of the @entity53 , players such as @entity0 really must be to the fore			1
revolution : @entity0 must be at the fore of the @entity19 revolution if @entity22 are to be successful this term the headline on the last of his internet blogs last season was written the day @entity22 lost at @entity63 in april , two days before manager @entity64 was sacked			1
a @entity9 saying , it reads : ‘ falling down is allowed			0
getting back up is mandatory			0
’ as a phrase , it would appear to work perfectly as @entity22 seek recovery from the wreckage of last season			1
‘ yes , i think it ’s appropriate , ’ says @entity0 in excellent @entity71			1
‘ we are facing a new season with new goals			2
it ’s a new era and we have a new manager and players			0
it ’s a new chance to show that this club can fight for titles			0
so , yes , it ’s time to get back up			0
’ during @entity81 ’s short time at the club , much has been made of the 62 - year - old ’s new tactical approach			1
rarely has a switch of formation prompted so much chatter			0
but if anyone is to benefit from a move from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 to 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 , it is @entity0			1
new era : @entity92 will benefit from the new role implemented by @entity81 at @entity51 he will start the season in the ‘ no 10 ’ position so loved by the @entity96			1
the @entity92 will be back in his favourite role - playing behind two strikers - after last season ’s struggles to the left and right of @entity64 ’ formation			1
it is also a role he played with some success under another @entity96 coach , @entity107 , at @entity108 in 2007 - 08			1
‘ i hope it will be ( perfect ) for me , ’ he acknowledged			0
‘ i feel comfortable in that position			0
i can play as a midfielder defensively or as a striker offensively if that ’s what i have to do			2
‘ but my mission is to assist and score			0
i can do that from this position and i hope i can have a great season			2
but more importantly it has to be a great season for the team			2
this system is difficult and it ’s difficult to adapt			2
you have to be very fit , for example			0
favourite role : @entity0 will play the ' no 10 ' for @entity22 and is determind to score more goals ‘ you have to be focused but , if you manage to master it , you can put lots of pressure on the opponent and you can hurt them with the ball			1
‘ i think everyone knows that @entity96 football likes to play a good way , a way i like to play and watch			1
this manager wants passing and movement and triangles			0
it ’s how i play my best			2
’ last season presented only brief glimpses of @entity0 ’s true self			1
he scored six league goals after his january transfer from the shadows at @entity146 but was rarely as influential as he would have liked			1
when @entity147 - one of his childhood heroes - took over as interim manager for the final four league games , he picked @entity92 for only two of them			1
hero : @entity147 , a childhood hero of @entity0 , picked the @entity92 in two of his four games in charge ‘ he spoke to me about it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he said to the whole team that he was going to use every player			2
he told me he wanted a different kind of player in that situation and that was it			2
‘ when i arrived at the club he was very good to me and i do n’t forget that			0
it was difficult at the start , after i arrived			0
the team was in a bad situation and i had n’t been training at @entity146 and i was n’t physically ready to play			1
the team did n’t play at our best level , none of us			2
i ’m looking forward to this season to try to do my best and helping the team back to the level we know it should be at			2
’ @entity147 , of course , is @entity81 ’s assistant manager now			1
in the weeks of pre-season , though , it has all been about the one they call the ‘ @entity182 ’			2
assistant : @entity22 legend @entity147 will act as @entity81 's no 2 at @entity51 next season in @entity187 on tour , @entity22 trained twice a day , with @entity81 so close to the action his players could all but hear him breathing			1
the phrase ‘ hands on ’ could have been invented for the former @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 coach and it is tempting to wonder if his habit , for example , of telling players how to take penalties - as he did with @entity20 in @entity202 - may grate after a while			2
there is , after all , no point hiring a great painter and telling him how to hold his brush			0
‘ yeah , he told @entity20 how to shoot , but it ’s very good , ’ he said			2
‘ he is a manager who feels every session			0
not just a game but a training session			0
to him , it ’s all important			0
he is very into it			0
‘ sometimes he sees a striker or midfielder not make the right pass , he stops the session and tells them			0
he loves to do that			2
‘ i think the example with @entity20 , he was right			0
if you face the goalkeeper you have to wait for him to go and then put the ball in the other side			0
helping hand : @entity0 revealed new manager @entity81 told @entity22 captain @entity20 how to shoot ‘ it ’s easy to say it but not so easy to do it when you are in the 88th minute of a game			1
everything he says is meant to help			0
‘ you must have an open mind			0
if you are a professional player , that ’s basic			2
i have had many managers during the past years and i can learn from all of them			0
now with @entity19 we have a new way of working and we are all trying to adapt			1
even the goalkeeper has an important role in the game - play			1
’ had some @entity22 players been more open - minded to @entity64 ’ approach last season , things might have been different			1
there is no doubt , however , the club feels as though it has a little more direction and momentum under @entity81			1
the club that was preparing to defend its title just 12 months ago still feels short of a couple of world - class players in key positions , while much will depend on not only @entity0 ’s form and fitness but also that of @entity20 and @entity261			1
as we talk in a @entity264 hotel another @entity92 , @entity265 , is conducting an interview in an adjacent room			1
@entity0 feels he will bring something to a squad he firmly believes can undo most of last season ’s damage			1
all smiles : @entity0 knows all about new signing @entity265 and believes the @entity92 can help @entity22 ‘ we played together at @entity274 and under 20 level for @entity276 , ’ recalled @entity0			1
‘ i know how good @entity265 is and i know he can bring very good things to us			0
he is a very talented midfielder and the manager likes that way of playing			2
he can also defend very well			0
‘ football has no memory			0
you can have a good result on saturday and be a good team but then lose on wednesday and be the worst team ever			0
‘ we would all love to win the league but the most important goal - what this club needs - is to play in the @entity23 again			1
‘ i can not imagine a @entity23 two years in a row without @entity22			2
’ unimaginable : @entity0 ca n't picture @entity22 going two seasons in a row without playing @entity23 football as he leaves the room at the end of our meeting , @entity0 still can not believe the story about his school quiz team is no longer a secret			1
neither is the one about him and his sister @entity303 posing for a poster advert for the @entity9 bank @entity305			0
‘ my uncle worked there and he asked us , ’ laughed @entity0			2
‘ on the picture , my sister and i are pointing at the sky and looking through a telescope			0
’ again the image is amusing but the imagery appropriate			0
it ’s time for @entity0 and @entity22 to look upwards once again			1
fame at an early age : a young @entity0 and his sister on a poster for @entity305 @entity321 new no11 , @entity19 chasing @entity322 @entity0 wears the new @entity324 boots			1

@entity0 insists @entity22 must finish in the top four

@entity92 should benefit from playing in @entity19 's new 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 system
