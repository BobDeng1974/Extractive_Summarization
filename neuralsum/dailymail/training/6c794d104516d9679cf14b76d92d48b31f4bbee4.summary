in fact its driver , accompanied by his wife and young son , continues blithely over the level crossing – seemingly oblivious to the train ploughing towards his vehicle			1
startling @entity15 footage shows the car racing across the train ’s path with a split - second to spare			1
it makes it to the other side just as the train hurtles through the crossing , outside @entity26 station near @entity27 in @entity28			2
the driver , who has not been named , admitted dangerous driving , claiming he had not seen the flashing lights or noticed other cars waiting at the crossing			2
he was given a 12 - month suspended sentence , disqualified from driving and fined £ 722			2
the footage was released by @entity36 to warn of the dangers of taking unnecessary risks at level crossings			1
other pictures show teenage boys risking their lives by sprinting over crossings across the paths of oncoming trains			0

@entity60 and @entity61 were killed at @entity62 in @entity63 when they crossed the tracks and were hit by a train			0

judge @entity78 , sentencing at @entity80 , ordered @entity36 to pay the large fine and £ 60,000 costs			1
he said : ' i have concluded that there was a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed and act upon relevant information			0
' there was a consistent failure to take timely remedial action - a consistent underplaying that this crossing was being regularly misused			0
victims : @entity95 ( right ) and @entity61 ( left ) were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at @entity62 in @entity63 ' warnings went unheeded , data insufficiently appraised and critical questions went unasked and unanswered			0
' remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed			0
' last year there were six deaths and over 300 near misses at level crossings .			0
