@entity2 craved a striker and , without a doubt , the @entity1 manager got one when he pulled £ 32million out and got @entity5 in return			1
the 25 - year - old , swapping reigning @entity7 champions @entity7 for @entity1 , already looks the answer to the prayers that so often emerged from @entity11 some 12 months ago			2
and there has been no adjustment period needed for @entity5 whose explosive start already trumps some of the @entity16 's finest imports , including @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
what other imports will the @entity16 get ? follow transfer deadline day live here ! best start : @entity5 scored four goals in three games for @entity1 in his impressive @entity16 start thanks : @entity5 seems to have brought an end to the @entity1 curse but his @entity16 career is young brace : @entity5 managed to score twice against @entity32 in the 6 - 3 win to bring his @entity16 tally to four with four goals in three games , @entity5 has made a better @entity16 start than some of the most successful recent imports			1
goals after three @entity16 games : 4 - @entity5 ( @entity1 ) 3 - @entity17 ( @entity42 ) 2 - @entity18 ( @entity43 ) 1 - @entity19 ( @entity1 ) 1 - @entity20 ( @entity44 ) 1 - @entity21 ( @entity44 ) @entity46 - @entity45 did score four in his first three games for @entity43 , but he had already been in the @entity16 for eight years			1
with four goals in three games , @entity5 looks a fine acquisition			2
the @entity51 ( and former @entity52 ) international took just 17 minutes to get going with his debut @entity16 goal against @entity55 on the opening day of the season			0
was it a fluke ? no. @entity5 netted again at @entity11 against @entity60 five days later			0
what followed were reports emerging about the striker 's fitness , suggesting he was out for six weeks after pulling up in training , but these proved to be hogwash			0
@entity5 looked fit enough when scoring twice against @entity32 - in the first and 90th minute - as @entity1 made it three victories in as many games			1
the curse of the @entity1 striker is something owner @entity70 know all too well			0
over the years , nearly £ 200m has been thrown at the problem			0
@entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity19 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity21 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 are among the imports			0
but now , with the returning @entity19 as back - up , the £ 32m @entity5 appears the best fit			2
return : @entity19 's @entity16 start with @entity1 saw him net just once in the first three matches gone : @entity20 nabbed just the one goal in his opening three @entity16 starts with @entity44 proven : @entity17 won @entity42 the title and scored three in three when he came to @entity95 offloaded : @entity21 enjoyed life at @entity44 better , and scored one goal in his first three matches vintage : @entity18 nabbed two goals in three games with @entity43 in the @entity16			1

@entity5 has scored four goals in just three games - a better start to @entity16 life than @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity106
@entity5 *signed* for @entity1 from @entity108 's @entity7 for £ 32million
striker scored against @entity55 , @entity60 and twice against @entity32
@entity17 comes closest to @entity5 's @entity16 start after the @entity42 *forward* nabbed two goals in three matches
