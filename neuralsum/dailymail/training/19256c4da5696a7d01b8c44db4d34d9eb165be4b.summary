@entity0 was yesterday threatened with having to quit the @entity1 if it refuses to ' kowtow ' to @entity3 's human rights judges			0
the warning was delivered by the new head of the @entity6 , amid an increasing determination among @entity9 cabinet ministers to leave its jurisdiction			1
judge @entity11 , from @entity12 , also insisted that ministers had a duty to grant the vote to prisoners			1
threat : the warning was delivered by judge @entity11 , from @entity12 , amid an increasing determination among @entity9 cabinet ministers to leave its jurisdiction his intervention once again puts the unelected court on a collision course with @entity24			1
technically , the @entity1 and the @entity6 are separate institutions , with the @entity6 overseen by the 47 - member @entity25			0
but mr @entity11 opted to combine two of the most explosive issues in @entity0 politics by saying that , if we want to leave the court , we may also have to exit the @entity1			1
his logic was that quitting the court would mean also exiting the @entity25			2
he added no state had ever been a member of the @entity1 without first joining the council			0
mr @entity11 said : ' that would plainly be a political disaster			1
' any member state who would leave the @entity25 , who would denounce the convention , would lose its credibility when it comes to promoting human rights also in different parts of the world			0
' last night , mps said they would not give in to threats - particularly where they involved @entity0 's membership of the @entity1			1
different : technically , the @entity1 and the @entity6 ( pictured , in @entity3 , @entity51 ) are separate institutions , with the @entity6 overseen by the 47 - member @entity25 @entity9 backbencher @entity53 said : ' mr @entity11 had no previous judicial experience before ascending to the heights of this @entity57 ivory tower , and it shows			1
' the only thing undermining the credibility of the @entity3 court are the @entity62 judgments it spews out			2
he and the other judges should take a long hard look in the mirror before complaining about @entity0 democracy			0
' ' if mr @entity11 thinks threatening to kick us out of the @entity1 is going to persuade anyone in @entity0 to kowtow to the perverse rulings of the @entity3 court , he 's got another thing coming ' @entity53 , @entity9 backbencher he added : ' if mr @entity11 thinks threatening to kick us out of the @entity1 is going to persuade anyone in @entity0 to kowtow to the perverse rulings of the @entity3 court , he 's got another thing coming			1
' home secretary @entity73 has said the @entity0 should consider its relationship with the @entity57 court after a string of adverse judgments			2
these include blocking the deportation of @entity81 hate - preacher @entity80 and the long - running battle over whether convicts must be allowed to vote			2
@entity84 , the justice secretary , has also discussed walking away from the court			2
this would allow the final say to rest with @entity0 's better qualified @entity88			0
judge @entity11 told @entity90 that all decisions reached by his court must be respected - including prisoner votes			1
suggestion : home secretary @entity73 has said the @entity0 should consider its relationship with the @entity57 court after a string of adverse judgments this is despite the fact that the democratically - elected @entity24 parliament has voted overwhelmingly to keep the ban in place			1
he claimed : ' a decision of a court must be executed			0
if a decision is not executed this is a violation of the rule of law which is a basic principle of any democracy '			0
quoting a long - standing argument of the human rights lobby , he said there was a risk that such an attitude would set a bad example to other member states			0
he added : ' they might say " well if the @entity0 does n't comply with our judgments , why should we comply ? " ' a decision of a court must be executed			1
if a decision is not executed this is a violation of the rule of law which is a basic principle of any democracy ' judge @entity11 ' such an attitude causes real damage to the @entity0 's international reputation , because it undermines the whole system and it causes great damage to the credibility of the @entity0 when it comes to promoting human rights in other parts of the world			1
the @entity57 court has 47 members , many of whom have no prior judicial experience			0
the court 's ' one country , one judge ' rule means @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 each have a seat despite their combined populations being smaller than that of the @entity153 borough of @entity154			2
a @entity156 spokesman said : ' we are clear in the view that prisoner voting is a matter for national parliaments to decide			0
' we will continue to push for further meaningful reform of the @entity6 when negotiations start later in the year			0

judge @entity11 also says ministers should grant vote to prisoners
intervention puts unelected court on a collision course with @entity24
mps including @entity9 backbencher @entity53 ' wo n't give in to threats '
