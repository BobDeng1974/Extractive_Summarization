the chief @entity1 spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against @entity5 lawmaker @entity4 on monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback			1
' i cant speak to the accuracy of those claims , ' the president 's spokesman , @entity12 , said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the @entity21 senator			1
and just because its been reported in the press , well , ' that 's not proof of them being a fact , ' he said			0
' i do n't know if there 's a @entity4 investigation			1
' ' if there is a criminal investigation on the way , it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference , ' he stated			1
the senator : sen. @entity4 , a @entity5 @entity39 , may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption politics : ( l - r ) @entity4 , donor @entity43 , @entity1 minority leader @entity44 , and her husband @entity45 , posed in february 2012 at a @entity46 gala @entity48 reported on friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo , and prosecutors , under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out , would soon bring charges against @entity4 that stem from his relationship with @entity59 eye doctor @entity43 , a wealthy and prolific donor			1
the senator 's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the @entity63 on his friend 's behalf , pushing back against accusations of overbilling the @entity63 system by $ 8.9 million			2
@entity4 has also repaid @entity43 $ 58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor 's private jet , mostly to the posh @entity71 resot @entity72			1
the senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal , and one of his conservative colleagues in the @entity77 , @entity78 , has suggested the investigation is politically motivated			1
@entity4 told reporters on friday , i have ' always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law			2
' i am not going anywhere , ' he promised			0
@entity85 , @entity4 's communications director , told @entity86 in a statement that ' the facts will ultimately confirm ' that his behavior was in no way improper			2
' the senator has counted dr. @entity43 as one of his closest personal friends for decades , ' @entity85 said			1
' the two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other ’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts			0
' she called the investigation 's beginnings ' suspect , ' referring to ' false allegations ' that have been ' discredited ' in the past			0
' the timing seems awfully coincidental , ' @entity78 said of the probe on saturday while speaking to reporters			2
' the very week when @entity4 showed incredible courage to speak out and call out president @entity110 for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security , ' is the same week reports that he 'll be charged came out			2
that 's ' troubling , ' @entity78 said			2
@entity4 , 61 , has seen pressure from the @entity110 administration over his positions on @entity119 and @entity120			0
speaking to reporters on saturday after an appearance at the @entity123 , @entity78 said the timing of the charges ' seems awfully coincidental			2
' @entity126 : asked monday about the alleged probe , @entity1 spokesman @entity12 said , ' i do n't know if there 's a @entity4 investigation ' the same week @entity132 's prime minister @entity131 ' came to @entity133 , spoke in @entity134 about the enormous threat of president @entity110 's misguided deal with @entity120 , ' he said , and ' the very week when @entity4 showed incredible courage to speak out and call out president @entity110 for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security , ' is the same week reports that he 'll be charged came out			1
that 's ' troubling , ' the @entity143 lawmaker said			0
@entity146 sen. @entity145 made a similar observation at saturday 's event , according to @entity48			0
' they leaked a story about an impending indictment right after the [ @entity153 ] conference , right after @entity4 said , to his great credit , stood up and said i want to look at any deal you with @entity120 , ' @entity145 charged			2
' as to @entity4 , like every other @entity158 , he 's innocent until proven otherwise			0
but this whole behavior around the @entity110 administration regarding the law is very disturbing			0
' attorney general @entity163 , according to the network , has already given his approval			1
but he insisted ' i ca n't comment on that ' when a reporter asked him about the report friday afternoon after @entity110 gave a speech in @entity146			1
asked monday about the alleged investigation , @entity12 said , ' we do n't know whether or not they 're true			0
' ' i 'm not going to comment on them for that reason			0
' ' the other reason i 'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously , ' and that is ' ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference			1
' ' that undermines the claims of a lot of people , including apparently sen. @entity78 , ' he stated			1
@entity4 's first high - level meeting at @entity191 related to @entity43 's @entity63 troubles occurred on june 7 , 2012 , according to court documents seen by the @entity194			1
the government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with @entity198 , who was then in charge of the agency 's @entity63 subagency			0
court papers also indicate @entity4 followup up the meeting with a phone call , and then took @entity206 sen. @entity205 , who was then the @entity207 , to an august 2 , 2012 meeting with the @entity191 's then - secretary , @entity209			1
@entity48 reported that @entity43 was one of the @entity63 system 's most - reimbursed doctors nationwide , during the years when he was also a major donor to @entity4 and to the @entity213			1
that political action committee , run by former @entity205 staffers , collected more than $ 700,000 from @entity43 and made sure $ 600,000 of it benefited @entity4 ’s re-election campaign			1
meanwhile , the conservative activist group @entity218 has called on @entity4 to resign his office			0
on a new website called @entity222 , the group claims he ' unethically , and likely criminally , compromised his ability to represent the people of @entity5			0
' the senator , now the ranking @entity39 on the @entity226 and its chairman until two months ago , has become a thorn in the @entity1 's side by taking positions that grate on president @entity110			1
@entity4 opposed the president 's rapprochement with @entity119 strongman @entity233 , saying in december that his actions ' have vindicated the brutal behavior of the @entity119 government			2
' he has stood in the way of the @entity239 's negotiations with @entity120 , threatening to lead @entity134 in imposing new sanctions on the @entity241 if it does n't shelve its nuclear ambitions			0
the @entity1 has insisted the @entity120 can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain			0
' i have to be honest with you , ' @entity4 said during a january 21 @entity249 hearing			0
' the more i hear from the administration and its quotes , the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of @entity254			0
' while he is not among the senate 's super-rich elites , the @entity5 legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges : his legal defense fund has already collected , and spent , more than $ 1 million			2
last week two of his @entity77 aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case , arguing that the senator 's actions , and theirs , are protected by the @entity158 @entity269 's ' @entity271 ' clause			1
those words in @entity158 's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny , including @entity277 investigations , while they are actively working on legislation			0
the doctor : @entity43 , a wealthy @entity59 ophthalmologist and a major @entity281 donor , was ordered to pay back @entity63 for $ 8.9 million in overbillings , and @entity4 intervened with @entity191 for him @entity283 : a january 30 raid of @entity43 's medical practice yielded van - loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files according to the @entity194 , aide @entity290 refused to answer 50 questions about @entity4 's conversations with @entity209 and @entity198 , and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator 's office and @entity43 's lawyer - lobbyist about those conversations			1
another more senior aide , former @entity4 chief counsel @entity299 , reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter			1
the grand jury wanted to know if @entity299 had emailed a staffer at @entity303 to ask the agency to stop donating used port - screening equipment – principally cargo - container x-ray machines – to the @entity71			2
@entity43 , the senator 's donor , controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through			2
the x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband			0
@entity319 - politics : dr. @entity43 controlled a company that wanted a @entity71 ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs			0
@entity4 allegedly helped ensure the @entity158 would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 @entity327 agents and investigators from @entity191 raided @entity43 's @entity329 , @entity59 medical office , @entity331			1
over a period of nearly 24 hours , then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing what news reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files			0
the @entity338 reported at the time that @entity191 auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments @entity43 's practice billed to @entity63			1
other news reports described an alleged scheme in which @entity43 used leftover fluid from single - use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients , billing @entity63 for a new vial with each treatment			0
the government typically paid $ 2,000 for each container , raising the possibility that @entity43 could have overbilled @entity63 between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 per vial .			0

@entity5 sen. @entity4 will be charged soon , news report said

his aides refused to testify before a federal grand jury about conversations their boss had with @entity191 officials and a lawyer engaged to lobby for @entity43
