@entity7 , 61 , who worked alongside @entity5 for several years at @entity12 , the firm which operates @entity13 , told @entity26 : ‘ @entity27 was a very dedicated pilot who had the energy and knowledge to fly into space			1
‘ he had the desire to get to where he wanted to be and that was to fly the mother ship when it was built and then get in to the space ship			0
‘ it was his dream , he was fighting for that position the whole time			0
’ @entity7 , who piloted the @entity1 on a $ 10million prize - winning flight nearly a decade ago , breaking a number of flight records , is proud to have worked with @entity41			1

he is pictured above with the vessel he said : ' @entity5 in my mind is what i call a @entity55 engineer			2
' ‘ he just beat me to working at @entity12 , we arrived at similar times , he was put on a program to manage a pretty complex project at the time called @entity61 , which was a twin engine , high altitude jet that could carry different kinds of payloads			2
‘ he knew that vehicle inside and out , backwards and forwards			0
@entity27 was one of these guys , you could pull out a complicated schematic and it might look like @entity70 to you , there are diodes and valves and dash lines and dotted lines , but he was very comfortable in that world			0
‘ that airplane is still the workhorse at @entity12 today , i ’ve flown it all over the country			2
‘ and all credit for the functionality of that aircraft goes to @entity83			0

’ when @entity12 began developing @entity1 , @entity7 was the test pilot while @entity5 operated @entity94 back down on earth			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i called him mini @entity27 because there was another , older @entity27 on the team			2
‘ he was thorough , capable , dedicated and very much wanted to be a part of the pilot community			2
‘ he was working hard in the background so he could put himself in a position to be considered for @entity13 - and he achieved his dream			0
’ wreckage : @entity13 plummeted to earth in several pieces			0
the wreckage was scattered across the @entity21 tangles of wire : the devastating crash has raised fears over the future of commercial space flights @entity7 also paid tribute to @entity115 ’s good nature saying he was a pleasure to work beside			1
‘ in this world , pilots being pilots , they are driven , they are @entity121 personalities , but i ’ve never witnessed @entity27 lose his cool or his temper which is easy to do when you ’ve got schedule pressures and competing designs			0
‘ @entity27 seemed to be able to rise above all that , which was pretty remarkable			0
’ @entity7 has had a remarkable career			0
on december 17 , 2003 , the 100th anniversary of the @entity132 ' first powered flight , @entity129 officer @entity7 piloted the first powered test flight of @entity1 , which reached a top speed of @entity135 and a height of 12.9 miles			1
