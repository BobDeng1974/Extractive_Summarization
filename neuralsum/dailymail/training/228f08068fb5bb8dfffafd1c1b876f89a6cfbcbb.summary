by @entity1 reporter published : 17:46 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 17 december 2013 for years it was a time - honoured tradition : families would wrap a fiver around a milk bottle to thank the postman at @entity7 , or slip a few quid to the binmen for a festive drink			1
but today as few as half of @entity14 households still tip tradespeople at @entity7 , a new study has found			1
just over a fifth of people tip their hairdresser , while postmen are the next most like trade to receive a festive tip ( 22 per cent ) followed by binmen ( 15 per cent ) and window cleaners ( 12 per cent )			2
( file pictures ) declining tips : a postman delivering letters ( left ) and ( right ) a 16 - year - old girl on her paper round putting papers through a letterbox milkmen are at the bottom of the list ( 11 per cent ) although this is most likely to reflect the dwindling number of residents who have milk delivered to their door			2
the older generations are most likely to tip , the study found , with 54.8 per cent of those aged 55 and above saying they tip , compared to 45.3 per cent of 18 - 24 year olds			0
but @entity44 are the most generous , with 16.9 per cent of those who tip giving more than a tenner , in comparison to 1.3 per cent in @entity48			0
people living in the @entity50 are most likely to dip their hand in their pocket for the postman at @entity7 , while @entity55 residents are more likely to tip their binmen during the festive period than people elsewhere in the country			1
budgeting account provider @entity60 , who conducted the study , found 15 per cent of people tip their binmen of those who do tip , the majority ( 65 per cent ) give up to £ 10 , 6.4 per cent give more than £ 10 and 28 per cent prefer to give something other than cash , like food or drink			1
budgeting account provider @entity60 , who conducted the study , suggested the low level of tipping could be due to increasing pressures on household budgets			0
@entity74 , director of communications at budgeting account provider @entity60 , said : ' the @entity7 box is a lovely tradition and a great way to show your appreciation to hard working tradespeople			0
' but with household budgets under increasing pressure it is perhaps no surprise that less than half of those we questioned leave a tip nowadays			0
