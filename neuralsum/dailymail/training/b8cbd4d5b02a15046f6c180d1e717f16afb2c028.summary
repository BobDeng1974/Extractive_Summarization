by @entity0 published : 14:40 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 21 march 2013 zookeepers have finally been able to get close enough to a protective mother gorilla to determine the sex of her baby			1
and after two months @entity6 , @entity7 , is finally able to announce it is a bouncing baby boy			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , gave birth to the critically endangered western lowland gorilla , on january 3 , 2013 , at 9.15am following a short and stress - free labour			1
but staff at the zoo soon found they were unable to get close enough to 16 - stone @entity11 to take a look at her baby			1
now , the only thing left to do is to decide on a name for the baby			2
the zoo is part of a successful primate breeding programme			0
the youngster , is the fourth offspring born to the 18 - year - old female			0
at the time of the birth , @entity42 , curator of conservation programmes and planning at the zoo , said : ' gorillas are very protective creatures , for the first few weeks , even months , the baby with stay very close to mum , she will carry it all the time			1
' even when it starts to become more independent , she wo n't let it venture very far from her			0
' because she is holding it so close it is very difficult to tell the sex , early indications are it is a boy , but we ca n't be certain			1
' she 's being very attentive towards it , cleaning it , feeding it , all the signs are good at this stage			0
' gorillas have been at @entity6 , which is part of the @entity71 breeding programme for critically endangered primates , since the 1960s and they have been successfully breeding the animals since 1985			2
after the baby gorilla was born , staff at the zoo soon found were unable to get close enough to 16 - stone @entity11 to take a look at him in 2009 a new 20 - year - old male , a dominant silverback named @entity82 , was introduced to @entity6 ' gorilla ' troop , ' which also includes @entity11 's mother , @entity86 , 38 , and her half - sister , @entity88 , 27			1
by that time @entity11 had already had two babies - her first born , @entity90 , arrived in march 2003 and is now cared for at @entity91 , @entity92			2
unfortunately , her second baby , a female named @entity94 , who was born in may 2007 , died aged just three months			2
however , following the arrival of @entity82 , @entity95 fell pregnant again and a male @entity97 was born last april			0
although @entity97 suffered some problems around six months old , when the zoo 's vet @entity99 was forced to care for him at home for a spell because he was n't getting enough nutrients from his mother , he survived and is currently living at @entity105 , @entity106			0
@entity82 is also the father of the new baby a 60 per cent decline in numbers in the last 25 years has moved the @entity112 ape 's status from ' endangered ' to ' critically endangered '			0
forest clearance , which has allowed hunters into previously inaccessible areas , combined with the deadly ebola virus , has been blamed for wiping out a third of all western lowland gorillas in protected areas in just 15 years .			0
