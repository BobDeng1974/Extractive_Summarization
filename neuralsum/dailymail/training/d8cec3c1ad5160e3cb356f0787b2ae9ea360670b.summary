there is too much acceptance , too much tolerance , there are too many people shrugging their shoulders			0
they seem to be saying : @entity6 are out , but we did n’t expect much from them anyway			1
why not ? are we all happy to write off @entity6 , out after eight days , and go on holiday thinking , ‘ there ’s only two months to the start of the @entity11 ? ’ has the national team fallen so far in our hopes and expectations ? that ’s embarrassing			1
have @entity6 become the equivalent of @entity17 or @entity18 — a country just happy to be here ? home before the bit with the penalty shootouts			1
all this is making @entity49 look a genius , but was his team any better than the @entity6 of 2014 ? the team that lost to @entity32 in the quarter - finals in 2002 was : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 79 ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 56 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 79 ) , @entity67			1
ok , @entity49 ’s @entity6 had a better central defence but was the midfield superior to @entity30 ’s ? tactics have changed but that team is not better than @entity30 ’s			1
so are we prepared to accept he is not in the same league as @entity49 ? we have good players			0
@entity75 and @entity76 are @entity32 ’s main strikers but could they get in the @entity6 team ? @entity56 was loaned out by @entity79 but he will be in the last 16 with @entity80			1
so do n’t tell me @entity6 ’s players are n’t good enough			2
i love the @entity11 : @entity85 ’s title charge , @entity87 ’s title win , the story of change at @entity90 , the emerging talent of @entity92 at @entity93 and yes , the new fixture list is out and @entity94 is coming			0
but he ’s not thinking about next season yet and we should n’t be either ! @entity6 went to @entity32 expecting to slug it out in a three - team group			1
it turned out that group does n’t include @entity6			1
yellow peril : @entity27 says it 's as if @entity6 are just happy to be at the finals , like @entity17 clinical : @entity105 scored twice to condemn @entity6 to an early exit in @entity32 pain game : @entity108 and @entity6 will return home following tuesday 's dead - rubber against @entity80 @entity6 need to toughen up - @entity108 @entity111 : exiting @entity112 , beaten 3 - 0 by @entity114 ’s second string , was their worst performance in a major competition since the war			1
national coach @entity118 quit and an overhaul was launched , with @entity121 clubs and the @entity111 fa working towards developing more technically able homegrown players			0
a programme focused on children aged eight to 14 served by 1,000 part - time @entity111 @entity122 coaches			0
under 21 players were promoted to senior @entity128 : the side was so poisonous four years ago in @entity130 that the players went on strike before bombing out with defeats by @entity134 and the host @entity136 cleansing was required			0
@entity139 was sacked , the entire 23 - man squad was suspended and federation president @entity140 resigned			0
@entity141 repaired the team before @entity143 ( left ) was installed after @entity144 to complete the job			0
he comes with the aura of a @entity29 winner and will not hesitate to omit star players for the sake of squad unity , as @entity151 can testify.holland : they were dumped out of @entity144 without a point — the first time for more than two decades they had lost three games running			1
manager @entity157 did the honourable thing and offered his resignation			0
in his place came @entity94 , an experienced and highly successful manager at elite club level with a pedigree for developing youth			0
by @entity165 and that is a team with @entity168 and @entity108 at its core , with exciting talent such as @entity31 and @entity172 — forget their age — as well as @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			2
@entity30 talked about the young squad making progress , but the average age of the starting lineup was 27			2
@entity181 ’s was the same and @entity183 ’s 27.7 — not exactly a fountain of youth			1
throwing on @entity31 only when the game is going against @entity6 is poor			1
he has some way to go before he can be compared to @entity186 , but would @entity6 have made it to the last four in 1990 if @entity39 had shown a similar lack of faith ? i ’ve written before that i would have started with @entity31			1
he could be @entity6 ’s @entity191 but when he came on against @entity181 he was put out on the right			1
he does n’t play there for @entity93 so why should he for @entity193 ? teams in this @entity29 have been rewarded for playing with freedom			2
were @entity196 scared of @entity111 ? did @entity197 sit back against @entity198 ? have @entity80 accepted their ranking as the worst team in the group ? they trailed @entity181 1 - 0 at half - time and beat them 3 - 1			1
they beat @entity183 with a goal from @entity208 , who ca n’t get in the team at relegated @entity210			2
@entity211 is @entity183 ’s most influential player but he must have thought it was his birthday when he played against @entity6			1
he made 103 passes in that match and only 81 against @entity80			0
they disrupted his game , but are @entity80 really better prepared than @entity6 ? @entity6 have been too predictable when they had the chance to be unpredictable			2
when @entity6 lost 2 - 1 to @entity183 , i worried that was as good as we ’ve got and so it proved against @entity181 , but why does it have to be this way ? if we all just nod as excuses are trotted out — it was too hot , we went out to @entity105 , we played in the jungle — then we are condoning the acceptance of @entity228 are no excuses , no harsh red cards , or unlucky penalty shootout defeats			1
exit strategy : @entity30 is facing questions about his future following @entity6 's poor performance head - scratcher : @entity27 was not impressed when @entity168 was played on the left baffling : @entity238 scored @entity183 's winner against @entity6 and @entity27 does not understand why the performance of @entity30 's side was celebrated so much pass master : @entity27 says @entity183 's @entity211 had it far too easy against @entity6 the @entity183 loss was celebrated in some places as the best @entity6 have played in a decade			1
but they lost , to @entity183 ! is that where we stand now ? championing defeats ? i ’m not calling for a change of manager			2
and before anyone comments , this is not an attempt to get my dad , @entity255 , a job			0
the @entity122 have got exactly what they should have expected when they appointed @entity30			2
@entity30 was a very safe option and that approach has transmitted to the performances on the pitch			2
but going out in the group stage of the @entity29 with only two games played should not be swept under the carpet			1
last year , the @entity122 decided it was more important for young players to sit on the bench for a friendly in @entity32 than gain tournament experience with the @entity271			0
that is one place to start putting it right			0
after a gruelling game against @entity183 , @entity6 were unchanged against @entity181			1
there was n’t the same sharpness			0
@entity279 left out @entity280 and @entity281 — two of their best players — for their second match and breezed past @entity285			0
you must show imagination with selection			0
@entity168 out on the wing in the first game ... he may as well not have been there			0
he ’s our best player			0
managing @entity6 is not an impossible job but people are trying to make it look hard			2
there is a lot to do			0
one of the biggest problems is @entity6 are falling — and too many people are accepting that fact .			0

@entity30 's side eliminated at group stage for first time since 1958
@entity307 *columnist* @entity27 says it is embarrassing for @entity6 's *failure* to have been written off so *lightly*
he has *criticised* the tactics used against @entity183 and @entity181
he would have started with @entity31 at the @entity29 , like @entity39 did with @entity186 in 1990
