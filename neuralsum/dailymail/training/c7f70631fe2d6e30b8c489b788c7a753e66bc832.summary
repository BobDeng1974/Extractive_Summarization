former care home manager @entity0 died at @entity2 's hospital in @entity3 after a ' do not resuscitate ' notice was placed on her medical file doctors have a legal duty to consult patients and their relatives before placing ‘ do not resuscitate ’ orders unless there are ‘ convincing reasons not to ’ , the @entity13 said yesterday			1
the court ruled that the human rights of care home manager @entity0 , 63 , were violated when a @entity18 order was placed on her medical notes without discussing it with her first			1
the landmark judgment follows a lengthy legal battle led by mrs @entity0 ’s husband @entity23 and paves the way for greater consultation of patients and relatives over end - of - life decisions			1
national guidance already recommends consultation , but yesterday ’s ruling confirmed for the first time that doctors have a legal obligation to do so under @entity35 of the @entity36			0
grandmother mrs @entity0 had terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to @entity38 , in @entity3 , with a fractured neck following a serious car accident in february 2011			1
despite a poor prognosis , her family say she had ‘ a strong will to live ’ and ‘ wanted to have every minute of every day ’ for her four daughters and seven grandchildren			1
mrs @entity0 had told doctors she wished to be included in conversations about her care , and even wrote a note to one consultant from her hospital bed which said ‘ please do not exclude me ’ and ‘ i will do my damnedest ’			1
so she was ‘ distraught ’ and ‘ horrified ’ to discover that a @entity18 order had been placed on her notes without her knowledge			2
when mrs @entity0 objected it was cancelled by @entity2 ’s staff , but it was reinstated days later following discussions with the family after her condition deteriorated , and she passed away on march 7 , 2011			1
mrs @entity0 's widowed husband , @entity23 , pictured with daughters @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) , said he was pleased with the judges ' decision outside court today appeal court judges found @entity2 's hospital in @entity3 violated mrs @entity0 's human rights yesterday , @entity71 , master of the rolls , ruled the first @entity18 unlawful , and that the hospital breached mrs @entity0 ’s right under @entity35 to respect for private and family life by ‘ failing to involve her in the process ’			1
he said it was a human rights breach because ‘ a decision as to how to pass the closing days and moments of one ’s life ’ clearly touches on ‘ a patient ’s personal autonomy , integrity , dignity and quality of life ’			2
yesterday , mr @entity89 , 67 , a retired engineer , said : ‘ my wife spent her life looking after the elderly			0
' she knew about the options and wanted to take part in discussions about her treatment			0
‘ it was extremely distressing for her when she found out about the @entity18			2
' we hope this will go some way to helping other patients			2
i feel relief that something has been done			0
’ @entity71 added : ‘ since a [ @entity18 ] decision is one which will potentially deprive the patient of life - saving treatment , there should be a presumption in favour of patient involvement			2
' there need to be convincing reasons not to involve the patient			0
’ the court stressed the importance of the case as @entity18 orders affect most of the population ‘ directly or indirectly ’ because 68 per cent of the population die in hospital and 80 per cent die with such notices in place			0
@entity64 , 47 , one of mrs @entity0 ’s four daughters , said : ‘ it was absolutely awful for my mum to find out that this decision had been taken without consulting her			1
we are really pleased with the outcome and we hope it will give some protection to other patients – that ’s what my mum did not have			0
’ current guidance – which is issued by the @entity139 , the @entity140 and the @entity141 – is now expected to be updated to reflect the ruling			0
dr @entity143 , chief executive of @entity144 , said : ‘ today ’s ruling hinges on a specific point of law			0
there was no criticism of our clinical care			0

@entity0 was in a car accident after terminal lung cancer *diagnosis*
@entity156 put ' do not resuscitate ' on her file without telling her or family
horrified relatives later found out about notice and had it cancelled
after mrs @entity0 's death , they *challenged* hospital 's actions in the courts
senior judges today find hospital was wrong and patients should be involved
@entity175 's lawyer hails decision as a key *victory* in right of patients
