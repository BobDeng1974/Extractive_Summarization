@entity0 says he could have been sacked in any other country following the humiliation of an 8 - 0 defeat			1
@entity4 face @entity5 at the @entity6 on saturday with @entity0 still in charge despite equalling a club - record loss at @entity9 last weekend			1
and the @entity10 said : ‘ in another country , maybe an 8 - 0 defeat means that you lose your job			1
in @entity16 , that is not the case – at the moment			2
@entity4 boss @entity0 was embarrassed by his side 's 8 - 0 defeat against @entity9 @entity0 watched his @entity4 players trudge off the @entity23 's turf after their heavy loss ‘ i ’ve seen it in the past			1
i have seen other teams lose 8 - 0 and nothing happens , and the manager is still managing and the players are still playing			1
everybody moves on , which is fine			2
but i can tell you , that it is only here			2
’ on tuesday , @entity0 and his players gathered in the auditorium - style meeting room at the club ’s training ground and reluctantly worked through the horror of their capitulation at @entity23 ’s			1
some of those culpable tried to offer explanation for their actions , but still the manager could not comprehend the ‘ embarrassment ’ which had unfolded before him			0
on saturday night , having flown back to the @entity47 amid a muted atmosphere , he remained at home , refusing even to venture out to a restaurant			0
the following day he again chose to remain indoors – he did not want to see his players – painstakingly poring over the calamitous clips needed for the team meeting			0
the players , it is said , have been quiet this week and no - one will speak to the press before the game			2
such was the margin and manner of defeat , only a reaction against @entity5 can right their wrongs			0
for now , words can wait			0
there was , however , a gesture from the squad to supporters amounting to around £ 60,000 in refunds for their match tickets , but most fans have indicated that they will instead allow the money to go to charity			0
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity74 sunk to the floor after conceding against @entity9 @entity76 , pictured looking over to @entity0 , masterminded an 8 - 0 win over the @entity4 rather , it is a performance they want on saturday afternoon			1
@entity0 , though , preferred not to talk of reactions and cut a confused and disturbed figure when he spoke to the press on thursday , perhaps that was the lingering effect of shock			1
‘ i was unpleasantly surprised , ’ he said			0
‘ why ? because i swear i did n’t expect that to happen to me			0
the way that we were , the way that we defended , the way the players were on the pitch , the type of group that we want the players to be – everything			0
i stayed in all weekend			2
but i am on my own and am a bad cook , so i had to go out eventually			0
’ in the wake of the defeat @entity0 suggested he was not responsible for the depth of his squad			2
‘ i have four defenders , i play four defenders ’ he delivered cuttingly			0
the club have moved to address that shortfall by bringing in 34 - year - old former @entity104 defender @entity103 and he could start against the @entity105			1
there will also be changes elsewhere with @entity0 admitting he can ‘ do what he likes ’ with regards team selection and no - one could knock on his door to complain			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 may choose to ring the changes for his side 's upcoming match against @entity5 @entity0 has brought in @entity104 defender @entity103 in hope that the 34 - year - old can bolster his defence the 46 - year - old saw a different side to several players at @entity9 , although when asked if he had lost faith in any individuals , he said : ‘ no.			1
’ the pause was telling			0
for no matter how hard he strived for optimism , @entity0 was repeatedly drawn back to @entity9 and the reason as to why his players surrendered in such sorry fashion			1
‘ i was lucky never to have been in that situation , ’ he said			0
‘ but maybe it ’s not luck , maybe i did n’t allow my team - mates to put me in that situation			2
‘ i think the most i conceded was six , against the dream team of @entity136			0
i can tell you they could really play			0
i do n’t want to think about what would have happened if we had been playing them on saturday , it might have finished 25 - 0			1
’ now 25 - 0 would have got @entity0 the sack			1
as it is , 8 - 0 affords him a shot at redemption			1
another heavy defeat , however , and local restaurant takings will be down for a second weekend running			2
it would certainly give the club ’s owner food for thought .			0
