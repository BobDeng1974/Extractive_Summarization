@entity1 - @entity0 @entity2 it seems incredible to think @entity4 has been hosting the @entity5 @entity2 since 1999 , but it appears one of @entity9 's circuit designs has actually become part of the furniture on the @entity13 calendar			1
@entity4 's sweeping nature can be a challenge to the drivers , but the biggest factor that can have an outcome on the race is the highly unpredictable weather which can leave plans and strategy in absolute ruins			2
in the past , race day always threw up a challenge whatever the conditions			0
if it was n't the flash storm catching out the drivers , it was the hot and extremely humid sun which sapped the energy from the drivers			0
a later start time since 2009 has limited the factor played by the sun , but race day tends to be an exciting affair as @entity36 looks back at the archive and memories from the @entity5 @entity2			1
for @entity1 memories i included a quiz half - way down the page but this week we will start with one			0
the @entity44 has n't changed its layout since the first race in 1999 but in which year was this overhead shot of the track taken ? ( answer at the bottom of the page ) ' not only is @entity52 the best no 1 driver - he is also the best no 2			0
' @entity53 ( right ) knew exactly who to thank after he won the first ever @entity5 @entity2 in 1999			1
@entity55 dominated the race after returning from a mid-season leg break , and allowed @entity53 to win to aid his title bid			1
@entity59 ( bottom left ) finished third but would go on to win the 1999 world championship leading the pack under the safety car and heading into the final corner is @entity55 ahead of @entity66 team - mate @entity65 in 2000			2
@entity55 would go on to win the race with @entity65 finishing third behind the @entity68 of @entity69 @entity55 had already been crowned world champion in 2000 , but the double @entity66 podium allowed the team to clinch the constructors ' championship			2
here both drivers ( with that red hair ) celebrate with test driver @entity77 ( right ) and team boss @entity78 ( bottom right ) the @entity80 was a joyous occasion for @entity66 , but it was the end of the road for @entity82 who driving for @entity83 competed in his final race			0
the @entity86 's sad eyes appear to reflect that an 11 - year career as an @entity13 driver was about to come to an end legend has it that the 2001 @entity92 was so slow that @entity93 needed a push up the hill from a track marshall to make it round the circuit during qualifying			1
@entity100 passes in his @entity101 which fared little better performance wise over the season race day in 2001 was hit by a flash storm , and clever tactics by @entity66 saw them change tyres at the right time before claiming a one - two with @entity55 ( front ) leading home @entity65			1
it was the first year where the race took place in its now traditional early - season slot @entity115 ( complete with a @entity66 nosecone for company ) runs his @entity118 off the circuit in 2002 after a collision with @entity55			1
despite the @entity122 not being at fault for the clash , it was he who would pick up a controversial drive - through penalty a quick glance in his mirror at the first corner and @entity100 will be stunned to find his team - mate @entity131 climbing all over the back of his @entity134 in 2002			0
this was just one lap after @entity55 and @entity115 collided benefiting most from the @entity138 incident was @entity139 who led home a @entity118 one - two in 2002			0
it proved a false dawn for the team as @entity66 went on to win 14 of the following 15 races during the campaign @entity147 appears to be a little distracted as @entity148 of 2001 , @entity149 , sits on the front tyre of his @entity151 in 2003 @entity152 had clearly learned nothing from @entity131 's first - corner antics in 2002 when he took to the air a year later in his @entity83			0
unfortunately it was the @entity118 of @entity115 who was again the innocent victim as his rear wing takes the full force of the impact @entity66 's @entity65 waves hello to the future of @entity13 after @entity68 's @entity162 celebrates his first ever grand prix win in 2003			2
joining the pair is @entity101 's @entity93 ( who started from pole position ) and was also celebrating his first podium in the sport drink up , @entity169 ! the 2004 season was all about @entity55 's dominance but a sub-plot from it was the emergence of @entity175 who here celebrates his first @entity13 podium with second - placed @entity115 ( left ) and race winner @entity55 another @entity5 @entity2 , and another @entity118 taking a battering			1
this time it is in the final corner heading into the pit - straight as @entity184 collides with @entity100 's @entity101 - putting both out of the race - which was won by the @entity187 's team - mate , @entity93 having been at fault the previous year for the crash with @entity184 , @entity100 ( left ) stormed back in 2006 to take his final career win			1
the @entity187 led home @entity93 in a @entity101 one - two with the duo celebrating with team boss @entity193 @entity93 will mark his @entity68 return by making his second debut with the team this weekend , but he 's already driven at @entity4 for the outfit back in 2007			0
here the @entity198 tackles a fast double right hander with the iconic start - finish stadium section in the background it was n't often that you found @entity93 and @entity204 looking happy in the same picture during 2007 but here they are all smiles for @entity68 following a one - two led home by the double world champion			0
@entity204 's second place finish came after a third on his debut in @entity211 @entity162 was world champion , but here it 's @entity213 leading the @entity66 cars round the first corner of the 2008 grand prix			2
@entity162 would win the race with his team - mate retiring , but it was the @entity219 who would lead @entity66 's title charge during the season the track is dry for now but not for long as dark clouds loom over @entity4 during the 2009 race			1
here @entity227 pilots his @entity118 around the first corner in front of @entity231 's @entity230 and the @entity232 of @entity175 as a monsoon hit the track , @entity175 took advantage to storm to the front ahead of @entity230 's @entity237 ( who would finish third )			0
as conditions became too severe , the race was halted after just 31 laps with @entity175 pronounced the winner and all drivers receiving half - points @entity55 retired after just nine laps with a wheel fault for @entity247 in 2010 and there appears to be no shortage of marshalls offering a lift back to the paddock for the seven - time world champion following his return to the sport after three seasons away it 's usually a one - finger salute from @entity258 after he wins a race , but he is n't celebrating second place here			1
the world champion has just recorded two straight wins at the start of 2011 in a season he would go on to dominate before claiming his second world title all eyes were on @entity266 in 2012 after the @entity151 driver narrowly missed out on a famous win having made a late error in trying to catch and pass @entity66 's @entity93			0
@entity68 's @entity204 congratulates the @entity270 on a fine drive to finish second			0
at the end of the season , it would be @entity266 replacing the @entity86 at the @entity276 outfit following @entity204 's departure to @entity247 well this is n't the happiest podium you will ever see			2
@entity247 ' @entity204 is sensing the tension in the air after race winner @entity258 ( centre ) controversially ignored team orders by passing team - mate @entity184 during the @entity285 @entity258 and @entity204 look on at @entity184 during the champagne ' celebration ' as the furious @entity0 hit - out at his team - mate for ignoring the now infamous ' multi- 21 ' order - a team call that indicated the @entity293 drivers held position with @entity184 in front of @entity258 it was easier for @entity204 to celebrate on the podium in 2014 as he stormed to his first victory of the season ahead of team - mate @entity227 1999 : @entity53 ( @entity66 ) 2000 : @entity55 ( @entity66 ) 2001 : @entity55 ( @entity66 ) 2002 : @entity139 ( @entity118 ) 2003 : @entity162 ( @entity68 ) 2004 : @entity55 ( @entity66 ) 2005 : @entity93 ( @entity101 ) 2006 : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) 2007 : @entity93 ( @entity68 ) 2008 : @entity162 ( @entity66 ) 2009 : @entity175 ( @entity232 ) 2010 : @entity258 ( @entity293 ) 2011 : @entity258 ( @entity293 ) 2012 : @entity93 ( @entity66 ) 2013 : @entity258 ( @entity293 ) 2014 : @entity204 ( @entity247 ) bold indicates driver still active on @entity13 grid quiz answer - what year was the first photograph on this page taken ? the overhead track shot was taken on the thursday before the 2000 @entity5 @entity2			1
