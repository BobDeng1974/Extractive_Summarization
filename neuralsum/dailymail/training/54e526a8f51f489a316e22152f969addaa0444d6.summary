@entity2 schoolgirl @entity0 has given the @entity3 ’s @entity4 appeal a £ 30,000 head start - by quizzing the rich and famous on the secret of happiness			1
her book , featuring the words of more than 100 celebrities , among them the @entity12 and @entity13 , was snapped up by @entity15 ’s and has already topped their sales chart			1
but the simple pleasures revealed in @entity18 are n't quite as lavish as you might expect , with children , dogs , food and scenery all favourites			2
sunshine and fairies : @entity27 of @entity28 cited both - and magic - in her response to @entity0 family man : @entity13 , pictured with his wife @entity31 , said that his family made him the happiest comedian @entity33 cites ' children in the morning when they have n’t woken up to misbehave ' while @entity3 presenter @entity35 plumps for ' my kids , my husband and a hot bath '			1
@entity40 and @entity13 also cited spending time with their children as the secret of happiness and so , in what is possibly the first time he has agreed with either party leader , did @entity48 's @entity47			1
among the dog lovers is @entity50 , who admits he badly misses his when away on the circuit because ' … they do n’t care whether i win or lose			1
they make me smile every day i spend with them			2
' ' walking my dog makes me happy , ' adds @entity57			2
' his utter joy at the word " walkies " never diminishes			2
such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying			2
’ and @entity63 writes : ' walking very early in the mornings during the summer with my little dog – either on the @entity66 or by the sea … heaven			1
' naughty : comedian @entity33 said his children ... but only when they 're asleep and not misbehaving dog fans : both @entity50 and @entity72 spoke of how their pet dogs made them happy unusual : @entity75 presented her happiness as a flow chart which unexpectedly included yodelling but not everyone chose children - or dogs - as the inspiration for their happiest moments			1
rocker @entity84 revealed that a cup of tea makes him ' uncontrollably happy ' , while @entity87 @entity75 chose , rather unexpectedly , yodelling			1
@entity27 of @entity28 told the schoolgirl that her idea of happiness involved sunny mornings before , rather bizarrely , going on to add : ' i do believe in fairies			1
' i do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion , you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys , just like you have today when you opened your eyes			2
' do n't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic			1
' @entity105 judge @entity106 says that for him it ’s : ' eating a bacon sandwich			0
getting out of bed and nothing falls off			0
' contribution : @entity84 spoke of his love for tea while @entity115 opted out of writing and sent doodles music : both @entity119 and @entity120 cited music - albeit of wildly different kinds @entity123 , who has a home in @entity125 , wrote back to 13 - year - old @entity0 : ‘ being up early enough to see the sun rise over @entity127 in @entity125			1
nearest thing to paradise on earth			0
’ some celebrities strayed from their brief to try and define how the feeling comes over them , with @entity133 writing that ' happiness is released like a kind of gas from a rock			0
' meanwhile there were some , like @entity141 chairman @entity140 , who were n't quite embrace the theme			0
‘ the rare occasion when i check my diary and there ’s nothing in it for the next hour , ’ he replied			0
@entity0 , from @entity148 , @entity2 , got her idea after watching a harrowing @entity4 documentary about a young girl caring for her bedbound mother			1
‘ i just wondered aloud what would make her happy , ’ she said			0
‘ i thought i ’d ask famous people because everyone identifies with them			0
it was an amazing response			0
’ family : like @entity13 , @entity40 agreed that family was the thing that made him happiest agreed : and in a rare instance of @entity47 agreeing with @entity13 and @entity40 , he also said family choices : @entity165 chose horses while @entity167 chose weather			1
@entity169 chose everything popular options : like @entity174 and @entity175 , most of those asked opted for either their dogs or families ' she got the idea when @entity180 , her dad , suggested she raise money for @entity4 herself rather than just grab his credit card , ' explained her delighted mother @entity183			1
' we ’re very proud of her			0
it was a lot of hard work			0
’ and @entity0 ’s personal recipe for happiness ? ' it makes me very happy to see my book on sale , ’ she said			1
' but also when my dad ’s football team @entity194 avoids losing			0
things are pretty glum around our house otherwise			0
' contribution : sir @entity200 told @entity0 that his family - grandchildren in particular - were most important @entity13 ' on a personal level , my own happiness index is very easy to explain : it is all about my family			1
whether it is the everyday routines i go through with @entity31 and the children ; taking my youngest daughter @entity210 to nursery ; helping @entity212 complete her homework ; or watching @entity214 play football and rugby , i am happiest when i am with those i love the most and enjoying quality time with them			2
' the duchess of @entity28 ' your eyes open and the life is a fresh , new day , the sunlight nudges through the curtains			1
i do believe in fairies			2
i do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion , you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys , just like you have today when you opened your eyes			2
do n't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic			1
that makes me happy , as every day is , therefore , a day of exploration and adventure			0
' @entity240 ' the sun rising in the mountains makes me happy			0
' @entity119 ' @entity243 ! lots of bass ! ! ! ' @entity50 ' spending time at home with my girlfriend and our two dogs ! i travel six months every year and miss being with my dogs a lot			1
so much so that i have travelled with them to some tournaments ! they do n't care whether i win or lose			0
they make me smile every day i spend with them			0
' @entity40 ' my family is the most important thing in the world to me so spending time with my wife @entity261 and my boys @entity263 and @entity264 is what always makes me happy			1
' @entity47 ' being with my four healthy children and thinking about how lucky we all are compared to many			1
this is a time to think about others less fortunate than ourselves			0
' @entity174 ' walking my dog @entity271 every day			0
whatever the weather , he makes me smile and we explore the world together			0
' @entity276 ' what makes me happy is the kindness of strangers			0
' @entity280 ' sitting in the sun and trying to paint the view , or possibly , a person			0
' @entity285 @entity284 ' my family , good wine , good musicals and my @entity290 cats			2
' @entity200 ' what makes me happy is to have a weekend off from my travels and my concerts and spend it with my family			1
i love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that i take			2
there 's nothing better to enjoy than having my wife , kids and grandkids around on a lazy weekend			0
