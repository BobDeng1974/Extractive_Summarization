@entity10 , the daughter of musicians @entity5 and @entity6 has been found of disrupting fracking at an exploratory oil site - by supergluing herself to a fellow anti-fracking protester @entity10 and her friend @entity11 glue themselves together during a demonstration outside the entrance of a drill site operated by @entity13 in @entity15 , southern @entity34 prosecutor @entity35 told the trial that access was hampered and @entity13 staff and contractors were prevented from going about their ' legal right ' to work there			1
@entity6 said her intention was to gain publicity by creating a ' striking and symbolic ' image to highlight concerns surrounding the controversial method of extracting natural gas from underground shale rock			0
and @entity11 - a veteran of environmental campaigns including @entity52 and the @entity53 to @entity55 link road - also said the intention was to gain widespread publicity rather than obstructing @entity13 employees			2
but finding the pair guilty , district judge @entity59 said their protest ' went beyond reasonable freedom of speech ' as it disrupted access to the site for two hours			1
the district judge told @entity11 and @entity6 : ' i 'm sure that you did beset , in the true meaning of the word , the @entity13 site by locking yourselves around the gate and thereby controlling access to the site			2
' @entity6 told the court she took part in the ' peaceful , non-violent ' direct action around seven days after arriving at the @entity15 site in a bid to galvanise public support against fracking			1
@entity6 said : ' the purpose of it was to create an image in the media that would be striking and symbolic of the lock - the-gate process , and raise the profile of fracking			0
' @entity18 @entity17 heard the pair cost the firm around £ 5,000 through delaying deliveries for two hours after they superglued their hands together finding the pair guilty , district judge @entity59 said their protest ' went beyond reasonable freedom of speech ' as it disrupted access to the site for two hours ' that was n't the intention			1
' i did n't think that it would be possible for two people to delay in any meaningful way			0
it was for a snapshot , and hopefully get more interviews after that			0
' under cross-examination from mr @entity35 , @entity6 was asked whether , due to her famous parents , she would have gained just as much media exposure without supergluing herself to @entity11			2
confirming to the court who her parents are , @entity6 went on : ' if you are saying that holding a placard is enough , then it is n't			0
i have done those things and i wanted to take it one step further			0
' @entity6 , of @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity11 , of @entity53 , had both denied a charge of ' besetting ' the premises			0
but after being convicted , @entity6 also pleaded guilty to trespassing on a railway bridge at @entity15 on august 18 last year			2
@entity6 , a @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity127 graduate , was given a concurrent 12 - month conditional discharge , and ordered to pay costs of £ 400 and a £ 15 victim surcharge			0
@entity11 , who has three previous convictions , was fined £ 200 , and told to pay costs of £ 200 and a victim surcharge cost of £ 20			1
the pair stood trial alongside three other defendants - @entity137 , 65 , of @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , 29 , of no fixed address , and @entity142 , 44 , of @entity143 , @entity144 , who also denied charges relating to the @entity15 protest			2
