@entity0 was given the green light to block welfare claims from @entity4 ‘ benefit tourists ’ yesterday following a landmark ruling by @entity7 judges			1
in a major boost for the government ’s reforms , the @entity8 said jobless @entity7 migrants can not move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they can not support themselves			1
it ruled against a @entity19 single mother who moved to @entity20 without a job , and made no effort to look for work , but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers			1
the @entity8 ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits the ruling was widely seen as reinforcing @entity0 ’s efforts to restrict benefit payments to @entity7 migrants and was interpreted as showing that the @entity0 can remove @entity7 migrants if they can not support themselves and are not looking for work			1
‘ this is good news and a step in the right direction , ’ he said			0
‘ the right to go and work in another @entity4 country should not be an unqualified right			0
there should be rules about restricting benefits			2
’ work and pensions secretary @entity46 said : ‘ this is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the @entity0 who do n’t have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become a unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems			1
‘ the case underlines that free movement is not an unqualified right and will have a major impact on the way the @entity60 interprets law in future			0
’ he said the ruling showed how the @entity7 needed clearer rules to help countries keep control over ‘ national welfare systems ’			1
the case revolved around @entity70 , a 25 - year - old @entity19 single mother who moved to @entity20 in november 2010 with her five - year - old son and lived in her sister ’s flat in @entity73			1
she was capable of working but had never had a job in either @entity19 or her adopted country – and was not even looking for work			2
she also had a conviction in @entity19 for petty theft			2
while in @entity20 , @entity79 received nearly £ 150 per month in child benefit and around £ 100 in ‘ maintenance ’ payments			2
neither of these payouts was challenged by the @entity20 benefits office and were not considered by the @entity4 judges			1
twice , the local job centre refused her application for ‘ basic provision ’ benefits worth around £ 300 a month to jobseekers			0
she made a court appeal and the case was referred to @entity94			2
the court rejected miss @entity70 ’s claim and made clear that her right of residence in the country was dependent on her having ‘ sufficient resources ’ of her own			0
work and pensions secretary @entity46 wants to block access to the new @entity102 for migrants the 25 - year - old @entity19 mother at the centre of the court case had tried to claim benefits in @entity20 without properly looking for work			1
@entity109 was living in @entity73 with her son when she applied for benefits and her local job centre refused when she failed to take up jobs that were suggested to her			0
both the job centre and a @entity73 court said that @entity79 , who moved from @entity20 in 2010 to live with her sister , ' had not really been looking for work			1
' @entity79 appealed her case all the way to the @entity8 which today ruled : ' @entity122 must have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants			1
she did not have sufficient means of support when she moved to @entity20 , ' and therefore could not justify her right to remain			0
it means she could not bring a case against the authorities based on @entity7 anti-discrimination rules , the judges ruled			1
it also declared that free movement rights are dependent on migrants not being an ‘ unreasonable burden ’ on the host country ’s social security system			0
the judges said @entity79 had not looked for a job and did not have enough money to look after herself			0
as a result , she could not claim a ‘ right of residence ’ in @entity20 and use its welfare system as her ‘ means of subsistence ’			0
they declared : ‘ a member state must have the possibility of refusing to grant benefits to economically inactive @entity158 citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member state ’s social assistance although they do not have sufficient resources to claim a right of residence			0
’ @entity7 migrants who come to @entity0 are banned from claiming jobseekers ’ allowance for the first three months they are here			1
for the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim , if they can prove they are actively looking for work – although this is to be reduced to three months			0
after that , they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits			0
in january , ministers announced they were banning jobless migrants from claiming housing benefit			0
@entity184 , of the @entity186 think - tank , said : ‘ this ruling reinforces many of the changes to the @entity0 rules which the government has already made			2
however , it does n’t change the fact that @entity7 migrants working in the @entity0 on low incomes immediately gain access to in - work welfare such as tax credits and social housing			1
‘ the @entity0 should therefore continue to seek changes to @entity7 law to ensure that benefits are only paid to those @entity7 citizens which have made a contribution in their new country			2

landmark ruling paves the way for tighter controls on access to benefits
@entity20 government won case against @entity19 woman demanding help
court rules national governments can refuse benefits to @entity7 migrants
*conservatives* say the court has sided with ' common sense '
@entity46 wants to ban migrants from claiming @entity102
