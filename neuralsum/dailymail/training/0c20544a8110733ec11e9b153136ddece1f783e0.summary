you may think that a dog looks cute when it rolls onto its back while playing			0
but instead of being submissive , canines may be exhibiting signs of aggression , experts claim			0
by studying dogs playing in pairs , they uncovered that dogs lie on their backs during a boisterous play session , not to be passive , but as either a defensive manoeuvre , or a useful position from which to launch an attack			1
down boy ! the experts found that smaller dogs were n’t more likely to roll over than larger dogs when playing as well as that ‘ most rollovers were defensive and none of the 248 rollovers was submissive ’			1
a stock image of two very differently - sized dogs playing is pictured scientists at the @entity26 in @entity27 and the @entity28 , @entity29 , were interested in why dogs roll onto their back while playing with other dogs , and whether it is a sign of submission , as many owners assume			1
some experts have previously suggested that the move is intended on preventing aggression , so that a dog that rolls over is submitting to a more dominant dog that is on top , @entity36 reported			1
@entity45 , lead researcher of the study , which was published in the journal @entity48 , examined 20 @entity50 videos showing dogs playing together , half of which were play sessions between similarly sized dogs and the other half between canines of different sizes			1
she also set up ‘ staged ’ play sessions where a medium - sized female dog was paired with 33 dogs of different breeds and sizes , and their play observed to see whether rolling is actually ‘ executed tactically for combat purposes ’			2
scientists have discovered that dogs lie on their backs while playing with as a defensive manoevure or a useful position from which to attack			1
this graph shows the percentage of rollover types			0
the grey bars show play seen in person , and the white bars , behaviour observed in @entity50 videos a study of 4,000 dog owners last month found a clear link between limited playtime and animal behaviour problems , such as being nervous when left alone , disobedience and snapping at other animals			1
while researchers ca n’t be sure that playing less is directly to blame , they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise			2
the @entity91 study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day			0
half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session			0
@entity99 , former chief vet for the @entity100 , said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood			0
he told the @entity105 : ‘ there is a clear association in the results			0
owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less			0
’ firstly , her team discovered that not all the dogs rolled over during play and in the 33 staged play sessions , only nine of the dogs rolled over			2
a total of 27 out of 40 dogs rolled over in the @entity50 videos and the action did n’t seem to depend on the size of the dogs playing together			1
the experts looked for signs that the manoeuvre was linked to submission , with smaller or weaker dogs becoming passive , for example			2
they also studied whether the action is part of interactive play , which proceeds a dog lying on its back ‘ launching an attack ( offensive ) , evading a nape bite ( defensive ) , rolling in front of a potential partner ( solicitation ) or rolling over in a non-social context ( other )			2
’ they found that smaller dogs were n’t more likely to roll over than larger dogs			0
they also discovered that : ‘ most rollovers were defensive and none of the 248 rollovers was submissive			0
’ in fact , none of the dogs that surveyed rolled over in response to aggressive behaviour by another canine to become passive , or submissive			0
instead , rolling dogs used their position to block playful bites and launch attacks on their partner			1
the researchers concluded that while dogs may roll onto their backs out of fear in some scenarios , when they are playing , the move can be used to give them an advantage when ' fighting ' back .			1

researchers from the @entity26 in @entity27 and the @entity28 observed pairs of dogs playing in person and in videos
they found that none of them rolled over as a show of submission
instead , most performed the move out of defence to avoid a playful bite
others lay on their backs to launch an attack , demonstrating aggression
