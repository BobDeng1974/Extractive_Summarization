@entity0 has admitted today that he did try to pick up a @entity2 schoolgirl using @entity3 after his embarrassing attempts to woo her went viral earlier in the week			1
the @entity6 star , 35 , said he had shown ' bad judgment ' for chatting up @entity8 , 17 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , after she went to watch him in @entity11 in @entity12			2
after she shared a photo on @entity3 a ‘ flirty ’ exchange of messages followed , in which he asked her age , if she had a boyfriend and if he should ' rent a room '			1
the teenager , a pupil at the exclusive independent school @entity22 , shared screengrabs , which included two pictures @entity0 sent of himself to verify she was not speaking with an imposter			2
' it 's the way that people meet each other today , but what i 've learned - i guess because i 'm new to it - is you do n't know who 's on the other end , ' he said			0
' you get a feel for them , you do n't know who you 're talking to			0
' i used bad judgement and i learned my lesson			0
' @entity0 's admission this morning gave the controversy credibility after many initially thought it was a delayed @entity65 's prank or some bizarre form of viral marketing for his upcoming film where @entity0 , playing a teacher , strikes up a sexual relationship with his teenage student , played by @entity72			1
during the friday morning talk show appearance , however , @entity0 said that it was just his way of trying to meet a young woman			2
' unfortunately in my position , not only do i have to go through the embarrassing rituals of meeting someone , but if i do that , then it gets published for the world so it 's doubly embarrassing , ' he said			0
what 's going on here ? : schoolgirl @entity8 , 17 , has claimed @entity0 tried to meet up with her in a series of @entity3 and text messages striking up conversation : @entity0 allegedly started chatting to @entity8 after meeting her outside the the theatre where he was performing @entity11 on @entity41 not wasting any time : the actor appears to start asking @entity8 how old she is and whether she has a boyfriend miss @entity8 , who attends prestigious independent school @entity22 in @entity10 , reached for her mobile and took some pictures of the star , and then turned the lens on herself and took some ‘ selfies ’ with the 35 - year - old box office hit in the background			1
it is understood that @entity0 spotted miss @entity8 taking the photos and shouted to her that she should put the photographs on the online picture - sharing site @entity3 and ‘ tag ’ him so he would be alerted to them			1
in the @entity3 screengrabs , @entity0 works fast to establish where @entity105 is from and how long she will be in @entity12			0
he then seems to fire off three questions in quick succession : ‘ you ’re 18 ? ’ ‘ who are you with ? ’ and ‘ do you have a bf ( boyfriend ) ? ’ making a move : the alleged messages show @entity0 asking @entity8 if he should ' rent a room ' in her hotel and attempts to convince her it is really him ' do n't tell ' : the teen asks the star to send her a photo of himself holding a piece of paper with her name on , which he apparently does miss @entity8 replies : ‘ nearly 18 , my mum and not if you ’re around			1
’ @entity0 then asks exactly when her birthday is and where she is staying in @entity12			0
the conversation then appeared to switch to text message , and @entity0 asks ‘ can i see you ? you ’re single ? what ’s the hotel ? should i rent a room ? ’ when miss @entity8 , from @entity9 , voices concerns the conversation could be an @entity65 by an imposter , @entity0 posts a picture of himself to prove it is genuine			1
the sensible teen then decides : ‘ i ’ll come back when i ’m 18			0
’ @entity0 responds : ‘ if you do n’t want to meet text me when you do			0
’ the screenshots of the conversation have taken @entity143 and @entity145 gossip sites by storm – although it is unclear whether they are genuine or not , and fans claimed they could just be a publicity stunt			0
' why are you thirsty for underage ones ? ' : @entity0 tweeted this after the news broke but later deleted it publicity stunt ? : @entity8 shared this photo in @entity157 on @entity3			2
@entity0 ' alleged actions could be to promote his new movie @entity160 , in which he plays a soccer coach who seduces his 14 - year - old babysitter ' not if you 're around ' : @entity8 , who also posted this photo of herself and her mother , apparently told @entity0 she was ' nearly 18 ' and that it did n't matter whether or not she had a boyfriend it is worth noting that @entity0 ’s next film is the story of a high school teacher who is dating one of his pupils – and several eagle - eyed online commentators last night floated the suggestion that the exchange with miss @entity8 could be a sophisticated joke			1
one man who has come out of the story very well is miss @entity105 ’s boyfriend @entity178 – an 18 - year - old fellow @entity22 pupil who seemed pleased to have beaten @entity0 in the love stakes			2
during a conversation with a friend posted on @entity3 , miss @entity8 said : ' @entity0 asked me to meet him alone @entity185 ! it was really him and i rejected him ! ! [ what ] am i doing ? ! ' she then added : ' i am going to regret this for years - it 's given me a confidence boost though lol			1
' the age of consent in @entity12 is 17 , so even if the exchange is genuine , @entity0 is not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law – but his actions drew criticism from fans last night .			0

on friday @entity0 admitted he tried to meet teen he *connected* with on @entity3
actor asked @entity8 of @entity2 , 17 , her age and if she had a boyfriend
student at prestigious @entity22 asked star to send proof it was him
@entity210 then posted two selfies , including one with her name written on note
also asked her in message later published online : ' should i rent a room ? '
' i 'm embarrassed . i 'm just a model of how social media is tricky , ' he said on friday 's @entity223
many thought it was a @entity227 's joke or bizarre marketing campaign for his upcoming film where he plays a teacher who has a sexual relationship with one of his teenage students
