by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 13:09 est , 10 may 2013 astronomers have found two ' dead ' stars they say give us a chilling glimpse into the future for our solar system			1
the dead stars are located 150 light - years from @entity8 in a relatively young star cluster , @entity10 , in the constellation @entity12			1
the star cluster is only 625 million years old , and the white dwarfs are being polluted by asteroid - like debris falling onto them , turning them into ' dirty ' stars			1
an artist 's impression of a white dwarf ( burned - out ) star observed by @entity23 in the @entity10 star cluster			1
at lower right , an asteroid can be seen falling toward a @entity28 - like disk of dust that is encircling the dead star our @entity31 will expand outwards when its nuclear fuel runs low and will ultimately blow off its outer layers			1
some of the inner planets will be consumed in the process and asteroids will be thrown out of their orbits			0
asteroids that veer too close to the sun will be broken up , and the debris could be pulled into a ring around the dead sun. @entity44 's @entity23 found the building blocks for @entity8 - sized planets in an unlikely place - the atmospheres of a pair of burned - out stars called white dwarfs , which are the exhausted cores of average - size stars not unlike our @entity31 ' we have identified chemical evidence for the building blocks of rocky planets , ' said @entity57 of the @entity58 in @entity59			1
he is lead author of a new study appearing in the @entity61			0
' when these stars were born , they built planets , and there 's a good chance they currently retain some of them			2
' the material we are seeing is evidence of this			0
' the debris is at least as rocky as the most primitive terrestrial bodies in our solar system			0
' @entity23 's @entity74 observed silicon and only low levels of carbon in the white dwarfs ' atmospheres			0
@entity80 is a major ingredient of the rocky material that constitutes @entity8 and other solid planets in our solar system			2
@entity85 , which helps determine properties and origin of planetary debris , generally is depleted or absent in rocky , @entity8 - like material			1
this discovery suggests rocky planet assembly is common around stars , and it offers insight into what will happen in our own solar system when our sun burns out 5 billion years from now			2
in around 5 billion years , our @entity31 will expand outwards when its nuclear fuel runs low and will ultimately blow off its outer layers @entity57 's research suggests asteroids less than 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) wide probably were torn apart by the white dwarfs ' strong gravitational forces			2
asteroids are thought to consist of the same materials that form terrestrial planets , and seeing evidence of asteroids points to the possibility of @entity8 - sized planets in the same system			1
the pulverized material may have been pulled into a ring around the stars and eventually funneled onto the dead stars			1
the silicon may have come from asteroids that were shredded by the white dwarfs ' gravity when they veered too close to the dead stars			1
' it 's difficult to imagine another mechanism than gravity that causes material to get close enough to rain down onto the star , ' @entity57 said			2
@entity23 is seen in this picture taken from @entity126 in march 2002			0
it was used to spot the two ' dead ' stars by the same token , when our sun burns out , the balance of gravitational forces between the sun and @entity132 will change , disrupting the main asteroid belt , @entity44 says			2
asteroids that veer too close to the sun will be broken up , and the debris could be pulled into a ring around the dead sun. according to @entity57 , using @entity23 to analyze the atmospheres of white dwarfs is the best method for finding the signatures of solid planet chemistry and determining their composition			0
' normally , white dwarfs are like blank pieces of paper , containing only the light elements hydrogen and helium , ' @entity57 said			0
' heavy elements like silicon and carbon sink to the core			0
' the one thing the white dwarf pollution technique gives us that we just wo n't get with any other planet - detection technique is the chemistry of solid planets			0
' @entity164 's team plans to analyze more white dwarfs using the same technique to identify not only the rocks ' composition , but also their parent bodies .			0

dead stars are located 150 light - years from @entity8 in a relatively young star cluster , @entity10 , in the constellation @entity12
