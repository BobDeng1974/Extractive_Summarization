a match sponsored by @entity1 , @entity2 , in a competition backed by a company who … well , what is it that @entity8 do , exactly ? not quite a @entity10 broadcast brought to you by official @entity13 partners in all key sectors of the consumer market			0
if @entity18 ’ victory in @entity19 perhaps lacked some of the sparkle provided by rival televised football attractions on tuesday night , there was value in it all the same			1
value that , they hope , may yet be measured in silverware			0
@entity18 striker @entity27 ( left ) celebrates after opening the scoring for the @entity30 club on tuesday night @entity27 ( centre ) celebrates netting @entity18 ' first goal of the night at @entity33 @entity34 : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity38 72 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 87 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 81 ) subs not used : @entity49 booked : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity41 , @entity42 @entity18 : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 71 ) , @entity59 , @entity27 ( @entity60 72 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 83 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goals : @entity27 29 , @entity56 57 referee : @entity70 attendance : 1,827 @entity73 ’s men booked their place away to @entity75 in the semi-finals of the @entity77 with something to spare , eventually running out comfortable enough winners against @entity34			1
goals from @entity27 and @entity56 ensured the @entity81 ’ 41 - year wait for a win over @entity18 would go on			1
and , in @entity56 , the visitors had the outstanding performer on view			1
one goal and an assist , plus a vital clearance , tell only part of the tale			0
the midfielder ’s all - action performance brought a great deal to a quarter - final played in front of a small and slightly subdued crowd ; this was never going to be one for the history books , more an opportunity for the diehards to prove their loyalty			2
some of those with sharp memories may have recalled that , almost exactly a year ago , @entity105 had made his most recent appearance at a @entity18 game right here at @entity33			2
back in the country for talks about a £ 16million rescue package for the club , he eschewed the delights of a bitterly cold night in @entity19 in favour of … well , take your pick			2
this postponed tie — put off from the weekend of the @entity120 - @entity119 game because @entity18 had lost too many players to international call - ups — was up against some pretty decent telly fitba , which perhaps contributed to @entity34 ’s decision not to repeat their experiment with temporary stands in expectation of a bumper crowd			1
@entity56 fires home his side 's second goal of the night in their cup victory against @entity34 @entity56 ( second left ) is congratulated by his team - mates as @entity18 ease through to the semi-finals just over six weeks on , the hosts were content to bank the takings from a sell - out attendance of 2,000 , all huddled into the one stand of this still - new stadium			1
if it remains a little exposed to the elements , there are plenty of worse places to watch a game in @entity119			0
the pitch is perfect , too			0
no excuses , then , for a visiting team expected to storm into the last four of a tournament offering the chance to win a trophy , be it ever so humble			0
against a team severely depleted by injuries , to the extent that manager @entity157 filled only four of the seven available substitutes ’ places on the bench , @entity18 showed three changes from the side who thrashed @entity165 at @entity30 on saturday — including handing @entity59 a first start since august 23			1
@entity61 and @entity27 also started in place of @entity60 and @entity62 , one strike partnership replacing another			2
a pretty astute switch by @entity73 , as it turned out			0
having begun brightly enough , @entity18 were actually beginning to toil just a little when @entity61 and @entity27 — aided and abetted by @entity56 — combined for the opener with 29 minutes gone			1
up to that point , we had seen @entity59 show a great deal of willingness and intent , @entity54 rampaging forward from left - back to some effect — and a couple of good saves from home keeper @entity35 , his best from a low @entity59 shot			2
@entity18 strikers @entity60 ( left ) and @entity62 keep warm on a cold night in @entity19 but @entity34 ’s man - marking , lying deep and letting the @entity18 central defenders enjoy as much possession as possible , seemed set to stymie @entity18			1
everything was becoming a little congested in and around the danger area			0
the breakthrough came as a great relief to the large away support , then			0
and it was well created , @entity56 knocking the ball into @entity61 , who darted into the box and picked out a cross			2
@entity56 ’s attempt on goal was deflected — but @entity27 was right where he needed to be , virtually standing on the goal line , to nudge the ball home from inches			1
the @entity81 , who had looked more than a little threatening in possession themselves , rallied after going a goal down			0
@entity56 had to look sharp to block a deflected @entity42 free - kick at the near post moments after the opener			1
@entity53 had the ball in the net three minutes before the break , although he had been flagged for offside — one of three @entity18 players on the wrong side of the line — well before finishing			1
@entity18 manager @entity73 gestures on the touchline during his side 's comfortable victory @entity54 had to look sharp to deny @entity216 a crack at goal from a @entity40 cross as half - time approached , a reminder for @entity18 they could n’t relax on a 1 - 0 lead			1
@entity59 ’s pace began to cause serious problems for the hosts after the break , both @entity37 and @entity36 finding themselves booked for fouls on the quicksilver winger within the space of five minutes			0
the second of those offences led to a near thing in the home box , as a black free - kick from the left wing resulted in a flashing @entity61 header that just cleared the far post			0
another set - piece opportunity , this time for a @entity37 foul on @entity61 , gave @entity56 a more direct sight on goal just before the hour mark			1
one he was n’t about to waste			0
lining up his chance from the edge of the box , the midfielder simply drilled the ball past the wall and through goalkeeper @entity35			0
that was effectively the end of an unequal contest , with the introduction of former @entity119 stars @entity60 and @entity62 for @entity18 emphasising the gulf between the sides			2
why , it was almost like watching @entity257 dominate in @entity258			0

@entity18 *cruised* to a 2 - 0 victory against @entity34 in the semi-finals of the @entity77
@entity27 and @entity56 scored either side of the break for the @entity30 club
@entity18 now face @entity75 away in the last four
