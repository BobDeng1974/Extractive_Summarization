as the dust settles from the @entity1 win on , conspiracy theories have begun to circulate about just why @entity3 did n't use the obvious ace up his sleeve			1
the @entity7 head coach has taken responsibility for the call in the dying moments of the game when the @entity12 ran a passing play , with quarterback @entity14 trying to find receiver @entity15			1
@entity18 corner @entity16 read that play perfectly , timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth @entity1 title for the @entity18			2
the flames of conspiracy are thought to have been fanned by at least one voice from the @entity12 locker room , who refused to discount the theory that @entity3 ' had a vested interest in making @entity14 , rather than @entity30 , the hero			1
' ' that 's what it looked like , ' the anonymous player told @entity59 's @entity58 in the immediate aftermath of the match			2
in @entity63 , sports correspondent @entity62 quoted a second anonymous seahawk who told him : ' [ @entity66 ] ca n't believe it			0
they wanted it to be @entity71			0
they did n't want @entity30 to be the hero			1
' the suggestion is that @entity3 chose @entity14 over @entity30 because of @entity30 's open defiance of the media and of the league as well as , controversially , his unapologetic black masculinity			1
twice before @entity30 has been fined $ 50,000 by the @entity59 for refusing to speak to reporters and was fined another $ 20,000 for making an obscene gesture after scoring a touchdown in the @entity12 ' nfc championship game win over @entity82			1
last week , on @entity1 media day , the 28 - year - old player answered all 25 questions he was fielded with exactly the same answer : ' i 'm just here so i wo n't get fined			1
' then , after the debacle of the game itself , his reputation seemed confirmed as he barged past news cameras on his way out of the @entity94 without even a word of comment			0
as @entity97 put it in @entity99 : ' unsurprisingly , a lot of folks in the league and in the media have n’t been able to deal , slapping @entity30 with what @entity104 called recently the “ unapologetically black tax , ” exacted upon black people in public life who are unwilling to kowtow to largely white critics			1
' later , @entity104 writes : ' @entity30 manifests a kind of public black masculinity that actively challenges and offends the stoic , team - first athlete the @entity59 still blindly idealizes			1
' @entity62 echoes those suspicions in his analysis for @entity63 , adding : ' @entity14 is your young clean - cut @entity117 - fearing media - perfect quarterback			1
if one was creating a superstar face to market for the twenty - first century , chances are they would look , sound and basically be @entity14			1
' he 's @entity32 with a @entity33 , someone who comes across like he has never spoken out of turn in his entire life			2
' the conspiracy theory goes that @entity3 thought that , with the final play was in the bag , it was much better to give that fairytale @entity1 moment to @entity14 rather than @entity30			1
as @entity62 writes : ' the politics of race , respectability , public relations and what 's in the best interest of a $ 2billion corporation all played into this			2
' carroll himself has tried to explain the decision that many say cost the @entity12 the @entity1 by saying they they did n't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game - winning play			2
he therefore decided to ' waste ' the play			0
dejected : @entity3 is facing a backlash after making what some have called the ' worst play call ever ' in the dying moments of the @entity1 determined : @entity14 responded to the criticism on monday after taking some of the blame for the play he said : ' really what happened , it was frankly really clear , we went to three receivers and they sent in their goal line people			1
we had plenty of downs and a time out and did n't want to run against their goal line people right there			0
' i told my guys that 's my fault totally			2
we had plenty of time to win the game			0
we were playing for third or fourth down , but it did n't work out that way			0
' the decision to pass rather than give the ball to @entity30 was instantly criticized by former players and analysts			1
' that was the worst play call i 've seen in the history of football , ' tweeted @entity183 running back and three - time @entity1 winner @entity185			2
@entity12 coach @entity3 was not surprisingly the man given the blame			2
' that play call will haunt @entity3 for the rest of his career , ' tweeted former @entity192 receiver @entity191			1
' give the ball to @entity194 ( @entity30 ) in that situation			1
' @entity3 said his thinking was that the @entity18 had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field , they were not well matched - up for a run play			1
crucial moment : @entity7 ran a passing play , with @entity14 trying to find receiver @entity15			1
but @entity18 corner @entity16 intercepted and secured the title he added : ' it is a really clear thought but it did n't work out right			0
we happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play			2
' at this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we do n't want to waste a run play on that , ' he said			0
' we make those decisions every game , all the time			0
they work out sometimes and they do n't other times			0
this one did n't work out right for us			0
' we had a good play			0
if it was a catch , it would be a completely different story			0
i thought it was going to be a touchdown when i threw it			0
i thought it was going to be game over , ' he said			0
@entity3 said he and @entity14 had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game			1
' we just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed			0
we did n't say very much '			0
some of the @entity244 players however disagreed			0
linebacker @entity245 told @entity59 he did not understand the call as they have ' the best back in the league '			0
devastaed : @entity12 quarterback @entity14 removes his helmet off as he trudges off the field @entity252 : he was consoled by winning quarterback and mvp @entity254 after the game			2

@entity3 played a pass instead of giving ball to @entity30
@entity14 then tried to find receiver @entity15 but missed
some are suggesting @entity3 chose @entity14 because he 's media - friendly
@entity30 , on the other hand , presents a *difficult* picture of black masculinity
