a spacecraft that is due to arrive at the former planet @entity2 later this year is carrying the ashes of the astronomer who first discovered the icy world			1
@entity6 spotted the tiny gleaming object - which at 1,430 miles across is around two thirds the diametre of the @entity10 - as a dot on the edge of our solar system in 1930			1
on his death in january 1997 , mr @entity6 requested that his ashes be sent into space			1
@entity6 , pictured above in 1990 , requested his remains be flown into space after his death in 1997 and his ashes are now approaching @entity2 , the icy world on the edge of the solar system that he discovered now his remains are about to visit the world that he discovered , onboard a space probe that has been slowly flying through the solar system for the past nine years			1
a small container holding his remains is fixed to the upper deck of the spacecraft , bearing the inscription : ' interned herin are the remains of @entity31 , discoverer of @entity2 and the solar system 's " third zone "			1
' named by an 11 - year - old girl after the @entity37 god of the underworld , @entity2 is one of the least understood objects in our solar system			2
it is so far away that it appears barely as a pinprick in the sky even through the most powerful telescopes on @entity45			0
images from the @entity47 have revealed a fuzzy picture of a molasses coloured world that teams with activity			0
over time @entity2 has also apparently grown redder , perhaps due to seasonal changes			0
no one is certain what is causing the coloured splotches , but the surface is thought to be mainly composed of frozen water and rock			0
chemicals such as nitrogen and methane are thought to lie frozen beneath the icy crust			0
@entity2 's orbit is highly eccentric , or far from circular , which means its distance from the sun can vary considerably			1
at times @entity2 may come close enough to the sun for some of the frozen nitrogen and methane to turn into gas , giving it a thin and temporary atmosphere			0
@entity2 's low gravity , which is a little more than one - twentieth that of @entity45 's , causes this atmosphere to extend much higher in altitude than @entity45 's			1
@entity2 's surface is one of the coldest places in the solar system at roughly -375f ( minus 225 degrees c )			2
the £ 460 million new @entity84 's mission will make him the first ' human ' contact mankind has had with the dwarf planet			1
however , at more than 3.67 billion miles from the @entity89 , it is an inhospitable place			1
temperatures on the surface plummet to -375 degrees f ( -225 degrees c ) , cold enough for nitrogen and methane to freeze , and there is little atmosphere			0
@entity98 's @entity97 's spacecraft woke up last month after a long hibernation as it makes its final approach towards @entity2			1
on 15 january it should finally be close enough to get a good look at @entity2 and its moon @entity103 before beginning a fly past that will allow it to peer at the surface , taking measurements of the dust , gas and magnetic field that surround the former planet			2
@entity112 , the principal investigator on the mission and a planetary scientist at the @entity115 , in @entity116 , @entity117 , said : ' we ’re currently in the very earliest stages of @entity2 approach			2
' when the encounter begins we ’ll still be very far from @entity2 , about 135 million miles ( 220 million kilometers )			1
' he added , though , that by may they hoped to receive images that were better than the grainy images obtained by the @entity47			0
@entity2 is among the most controversial objects in the solar system			0
since its discovery by mr @entity6 up until 2006 , @entity2 was considered to be the ninth planet in the solar system			1
however , after the discovery of several other @entity2 - sized objects in the far reaches of the solar system , astronomers decided to downgrade its status			2
they eventually settled on describing @entity2 , and other objects , like it as dwarf planets			2
its official designation is now asteroid number 134340			0
the artist 's impression above shows the @entity142 spacecraft as it approaches @entity2 and its three moons @entity98 obtained these images from the @entity47 in 2010 showing the coloured world of @entity2 however , scientists believe that @entity2 is still vitally important and could hold a wealth of information about the far corners of our solar system and how it formed			1
@entity2 is thought to be composed mainly of frozen water ice , methane , nitrogen and rocks surrounding a metal and rock core			0
@entity142 is carrying seven scientific instruments designed to take infrared and ultraviolet images of the planet , along with a high resolution camera			0
a particle spectrometer and a dust detector will also be used to measure the solar wind and other particles that are found around the former planet			0
@entity6 , seen here in 1931 , discovered @entity2 in 1930 while working at the @entity168 the @entity97 's probe , seen above in this artist 's impression , will use miniature cameras , radio science experiment , ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers to study the geology of @entity2 and its moon @entity103 this is one of the clearest images obtained of @entity2 and its moon @entity103 by the @entity47 dr @entity180 , @entity98 's co-investigator of the @entity97 's mission , said : ' while we have some idea of what we expect to see , i ca n’t help but think that history will repeat itself , and we ’ll find ourselves astounded by something new , something we had never expected to see			1
' i often think about the fact that the first time we ’ve taken a close - up look at an object in the solar system , our understanding of that object immediately leaps forward			0
' from volcanoes on @entity196 , to hydrocarbon lakes on @entity199 ’s @entity198 , to nitrogen geysers on @entity201 , and innumerable other examples , we ’ve seen remarkable things that have taught us much about what goes on in our sun ’s neighborhood			0
' @entity2 's surface , seen here in an artist 's impression , is thought to be composed mainly of frozen ice and rock			2

@entity214 astronomer @entity6 discovered the icy world in 1930
upon his death in 1997 he requested that his ashes be carried into space
his remains are inside a container fixed to @entity98 's @entity97 's probe
they have spent nine years travelling 3.67 billion miles towards @entity2
the £ 460 million mission will be mankind 's closest encounter with @entity2
@entity2 was officially downgraded as a planet by astronomers in 2006
it is now known as a dwarf planet along with several similar rocky worlds
