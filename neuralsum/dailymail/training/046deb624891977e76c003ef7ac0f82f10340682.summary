@entity0 underlined his value to @entity2 – and @entity3 – as he helped the @entity5 side into the fifth round at the expense of nine - man @entity8			1
@entity0 is the subject of a £ 3.5million bid from @entity3 but @entity2 are refusing to sell their leading scorer for less than £ 5m			1
they left the @entity15 international on the bench and he came on to score the decisive second goal in the 78th minute in front of just 5,928 supporters at @entity21			1
@entity2 came from behind to beat nine - man @entity8 3 - 1 in their @entity24 fourth round clash at @entity21 @entity25 fired @entity8 into the lead with a brilliant long - range effort that flew into the top corner of the net @entity25 watches on as his shot from distance finds the back of the net during the first half of the @entity24 clash but the hosts were behind for less than two minutes , @entity36 scored the equaliser after a good cross from @entity40 @entity2 midfielder @entity36 celebrates after scoring the goal that brought the hosts back onto level terms at @entity21 @entity3 target @entity0 scores the winning goal for @entity2 with 12 minutes left to play @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity46 6 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 7 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity40 7 ; @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 5 ( @entity53 41 , 6 , @entity54 77 , 6 ) , @entity55 8 ; @entity36 7 ; @entity56 7 ( @entity57 60 , 7 )			1

sent off : @entity66 , @entity25			1
att : 5928 it not only showed that @entity0 is unlikely to have any trouble scoring against top - flight opposition , but also why @entity2 ’s @entity91 owners @entity89 ’s are holding out for an extra £ 1.5m			1
manager @entity92 said : ‘ if you look at the last striker that moved into the @entity96 and for how much , you ’re not talking peanuts these days			2
‘ our owners have rightly put a value on him			0
if that value is match then there ’s a decision to be made , but at the moment the figures are nowhere near what they are looking for			0
if @entity0 goes , he will be a big miss. ‘ we had no trouble putting back in the squad and putting him on			2
people involved in the game might try and turn players ’ heads but he ’s conducted himself magnificently well			0
’ @entity92 acknowledged that the sending - off of @entity8 centre - back @entity66 in the sixth - minute ‘ levelled the game ’			1
@entity66 was caught out by the sheer pace of @entity56 as the striker chased @entity49 ’s long ball and appeared to lean into his opponent on the edge of the penalty box			2
both players went to ground and it seemed a harsh decision by referee @entity84 to produce a straight red card			0
@entity8 were then reduced to nine men two minutes into added time at the end of the game when @entity25 allowed frustration to get the better of him and ploughed into the back of @entity36			1
the @entity133 will now miss the next three @entity96 fixtures against @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , completing a miserable couple of weeks for the @entity140 club in which leading scorer @entity141 was sold to @entity142 and they lost 5 - 0 at home to @entity144			2
‘ the season wo n’t fizzle out , i will make sure of that , ’ said manager @entity145 , who dismissed speculation linking his club with a bid for @entity0 ’s strike partner @entity54			2
‘ it ’s my job and i wo n’t accept that			0
we are in a difficult moment but it ’s important we come through that together			0
@entity55 made sure of @entity2 ’s place in the fifth round when @entity64 allowed his effort from 25 yards to slip through his grasp @entity8 defender @entity66 was sent off by referee @entity84 in just the seventh minute of play after a foul on @entity56 last man @entity66 got the wrong side of @entity56 and then , as he attempted a challenge , he brought both him and the striker to the ground @entity25 heads to the dressing room after being shown a red card in injury time for a poor challenge on @entity36 ( centre ) @entity8 keeper @entity64 looks dejected after conceding for the eighth time in two appearances ‘ the first red card was a coming together			1
whose arms were across who ? you are running a risk as the last defender but , to be fair to the attacker , he did n’t appeal			0
‘ the second one was harsh			0
he had a lunge but it was n’t reckless or dangerous			0
i think it warranted a yellow card but the ref could n’t wait to get the red out			0
‘ you ca n’t react like that though and i spoke to @entity25 about it afterwards			2
’ @entity25 had fired @entity8 ahead in the 21st minute with a stunning right - foot strike into the top corner from 25 yards			1
the lead lasted less than two minutes , however , as @entity50 knocked down @entity40 ’s looping cross to the far post and @entity36 hooked the ball past @entity64			2
@entity92 sent on @entity0 and @entity54 and it was the former who made the breakthrough 12 minutes from time			2
@entity0 ’s header from an @entity40 cross was blocked but the ball fell kindly for him to bundle it home from close - range			1
@entity55 made sure of @entity2 ’s place in the fifth round in the 89th minute when @entity64 allowed his effort from 20 yards to slip through his grasp and trickle over the line			1
@entity92 admitted it was a shame that more fans were not at @entity21 to see it with the crowd roughly two thirds down on @entity2 ’s average league attendances this season			1
only a small contingent made the trip from @entity8 for a lunchtime game in @entity217 that was being televised on @entity218			0
‘ i understand the situation , ’ said @entity92			0
‘ it ’s the end of the month and people are n’t flush with money			0
‘ hopefully we ’ll get another home draw against a @entity96 team and see if we can try and fill it			0
’ @entity8 winger @entity72 shields the ball while @entity2 's @entity47 tries to pull him off it @entity145 watches his team from the sidelines as they try to bounce back from their 5 - 0 hammering by @entity144 @entity2 manager @entity92 greets opposition boss @entity145 before the game at @entity21 @entity47 and @entity8 full back @entity68 compete for the ball during the first half of the @entity24 clash @entity8 striker @entity73 , who has been the subject of transfer rumours , shouts instructions to his team - mates former @entity242 midfielder @entity25 shields the ball while closed down by @entity40 and @entity55 @entity243 defender @entity70 goes shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity56 during the first half @entity2 's @entity52 , who was substituted in the first half , flies into a challenge with @entity8 midfielder @entity71 @entity8 's @entity247 challenges @entity2 midfielder @entity55 , who tumbles to the ground as a result there was a sparse crowd at @entity21 to watch the @entity24 fourth round clash between @entity2 and @entity8			1

@entity8 finished with nine men after @entity25 and @entity66 were sent off
@entity25 opened the scoring for the @entity96 side with a long - range effort
but @entity36 equalised for @entity2 less than two minutes later
*rovers* substitute @entity0 then put the hosts in front late in the second half
@entity55 then added a third goal to seal the *victory* at @entity21
