by @entity0 last updated at 5:41 pm on 30th january 2012 when his son @entity2 was given just months to live without a lifesaving transplant , devoted father @entity1 made a brave decision			1
his son was suffering from a rare liver condition and it was unlikely that surgeons would find a donor liver in time			1
so he decided to step forward and risk his life to donate part of his own liver to save his desperately ill son			1
surgeons removed a fifth of mr @entity17 ’s liver and transplanted it into his son - who has now made a complete recovery			1
mrs @entity19 , 42 , a pre-school teacher , said : ‘ i ’m just so grateful to @entity1 for saving our son			2
a family affair : when his son @entity2 ( right ) was given just months to live without a lifesaving transplant , devoted father @entity1 made a brave decision and decided to donate part of his own liver ‘ it was a risky operation for him , but he never hesitated to risk his own life to save @entity2			1
it was terrible seeing them both go through the operations at the same time , and i had to go between one hospital ward and the other to help them both			2
but luckily they have both recovered			0
to see @entity2 doing so well now is amazing			0
’ @entity2 , now three , was diagnosed with the life - threatening condition biliary atresia when he was just 12 weeks old			1
biliary atresia is a serious but rare disease of the liver that affects newborn children			1
it occurs in approximately one in 10,000 babies and it means that the loss of the bile ducts cause bile to remain in the liver and damage it			1
it can lead to liver failure which can only be cured with a transplant			1
mrs @entity19 first noticed there was a problem with her son when he was just four days old , in february 2008			0
she said : ‘ he was jaundiced , but i thought that it would clear up within a few days as a lot of babies are jaundiced after birth			0
‘ two weeks later he was still jaundiced , so i started to get worried			0
at his eight week check up his stomach was so swollen too that his belly button had been pushed outwards , but the @entity60 just told me to put him in the window to get some more sunlight			0
a rare disease in which the tubes which drain liquid bile from the liver are progressively destroyed			1
this fibrosis of the biliary duct system results in a build up of bile , which damages the liver			1
as a result , the condition invariably leads to death from liver failure by the age of two if untreated			1
effective surgery can relieve symptoms in most cases and a liver transplant is also an option			1
as a result , survival rates are now above 90 per cent			0
it 's not clear how or why the disease occurs , and many factors may be involved			0
@entity88 is made by the liver and helps with the digestion of fats			1
if bile is not removed from the liver , it builds up and begins to damage it			1
the baby can develop develop jaundice , or a yellow colour of the skin as levels of the bile chemical bilirubin rise in the blood			0
tests are often required to confirm a diagnosis of biliary atresia , as the symptoms can be confused with other conditions			0
the earlier the condition is detected , the less damage it will have done to the liver and the better the chance of a successful outcome to treatment			1
‘ when i showed the doctor his stomach he said that it was normal for his belly button to be stuck out			0
’ @entity2 ’s health continued to deteriorate and when he was 12 weeks old his condition was diagnosed as biliary atresia			0
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ we were so shocked when the doctors told us what he had , and completely devastated			0
’ @entity2 underwent an operation immediately to try and redirect the bile through his liver but it was n’t a success			2
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ his liver had already been too badly damaged for the operation to work			2
if he had been diagnosed earlier when his symptoms first became apparent then he would probably only have needed the first operation			0
‘ but by the time it was carried out the surgeons told us that it was too badly damaged			0
his only chance of survival was a liver transplant			2
’ @entity2 was put onto the transplant list for seven months , but as the months went by , no donor liver could be found			1
@entity2 ’s condition started to worsen and the doctors approached mr @entity17 to see if he would consider donating part of his own liver to save his son			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ after two months of being on the transplant list , there was no donor to be found and @entity2 started to get worse , which was terrifying			2
we knew that a liver transplant was the only way of saving him			2
‘ when the doctors asked @entity1 if he would be a donor , he did n’t hesitate			0
luckily he proved to be a good match for @entity2 , which meant that the transplant could go ahead			0
‘ i was worried about both my son and my husband being in the operating theatre at the same time , and it was a risky decision for @entity1 to make , but it was @entity2 ’s only chance of survival and he did n’t hesitate to save him			0
’ the transplant took place in december 2008 and mr @entity17 , who works in pharmaceuticals , was taken down first to the operating theatre , mrs @entity19 said : ‘ i walked down with @entity1 first , then i had to carry @entity2 down a short while later			1
it was a nervewracking wait whilst the operations took place and i just had to pray that everything would be alright			0
’ a fifth of his father ’s liver was taken out and transplanted into @entity2 and operation was a success			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ i had to run between the hospital wards after the operation and i would feel guilty leaving one to go and see the other			0
but just a couple of days after the operation , @entity1 was well enough to walk down the corridor and come and see @entity2			0
it was a very emotional moment , knowing that he had saved his son ’s life			2
’ mr @entity17 took two months to recover before he went back to work , but @entity2 suffered constant infections and potential rejection for the next two years and was in hospital			1
he has only just made a complete recovery and the family , who are supported by the @entity196 , are thrilled with his progress			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ we had a constant worry that the liver was going to be rejected and he was constantly having to go back into hospital for treatment , but now it finally seems to have settled down and he is doing well			2
he has to go for check ups every two months now , and he has just started nursery school in september			2
i am so grateful to @entity1 - he has given our son a second chance at life			2
