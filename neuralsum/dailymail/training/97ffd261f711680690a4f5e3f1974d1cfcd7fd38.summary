by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:49 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:22 est , 19 december 2013 an elderly patient starved because a ‘ nil by mouth ’ sign meant for the previous occupant of her bed had not been removed			1
a damning report into care at the @entity12 also found that another elderly patient was left completely naked on top of a soiled sheet , while others were forced to wet the bed after their repeated calls for assistance went unanswered			1
a dementia patient was also left on the verge of malnutition because they were unable to reach food or drink left for them			1
the @entity12 in @entity26 has received a damning hospital inspection report			1
patients were found to have had fluids and food restricted by mistake while others were left lying in soiled or wet beds the terrible treatment came to light after the @entity36 , which inspects hospitals , visited in october			1
the two - day inspection singled out wards three and 26 for being particularly bad and understaffed			2
the report states the family of an elderly woman were surprised to find the ‘ nil by mouth ’ sign on her bed and were shocked when it was realised it was n’t meant for her			1
yet it took another five hours for the patient to be given water , such was the lack of staff on the ward			0
the report states : ' one person on ward 3 told us they had come to visit their relative and had been surprised to find they had a sign above their bed saying " nil by mouth " , which told staff not to offer this patient food or fluids orally			1
' the relative had questioned this with a nurse , who told them that their relative was due to undergo an investigation , which meant that they could n’t eat or drink			0
' they then asked the nurse to find out what this investigation was			0
when the nurse returned they said that the patient was not in fact meant to be ‘ nil by mouth ’ but that the sign had been left on the bed from a previous patient			1
' this meant that the patient had missed breakfast and lunch , and had not received fluidssince their admission to the ward			0
' the concerned relative went on to say that although this mistake was discovered at 2pm , when they returned to the ward at 7pm their relative had still not been given water to drink			0
' the report also highlights the case of a dementia patient who lost a significant amount of weight because they were unable to reach their food just inches away			1
despite the scathing report from the chief inspector of hospitals , professor sir @entity108 ( left ) , @entity107 chief executive @entity106 ( right ) said there was no reason for him to resign it reads : ' despite them being able to eat independently , food and drinks had been left out of their reach and left to go cold			1
' as a result , their relative had lost a significant amount of weight on the ward			0
' when they asked about the weight loss they were told that staff had weighed their relative that morning and they had weighed 90 kilograms			0
' as they felt that this did not seem correct , they asked staff to weigh them again			0
on that occasion they weighed 69 kilograms			0
' they said that the ward had given their relative a @entity134 ( @entity136 ) score of zero after the first weight was recorded , which needed to be changed to a three after the second weight was recorded			0
@entity139 , 84 , telephoned her family from the hospital because she could not breathe , and died 20 minutes later ' this score of three showed that their relative was at risk of malnutrition			1
' the @entity107 was one of the first to be inspected by the @entity36 in the wake of the @entity149 scandal , following complaints about the level of care there			1
the inspection found that nurses on ward three accepted staffing levels were ‘ horrendous ’			1
the chief inspector , sir @entity108 , concluded : ' the trust did not employ enough staff , even though it was fully aware that nearly all its beds were occupied all the time			2
professor sir @entity108 , the chief inspector of @entity162 , said : ' whenever we inspect we will always ask the following five questions of every service : is it safe ? is it effective ? is it caring ? is it responsive to people 's needs ? is it well - led ? ' at @entity12 , we were told about basic nursing care which was not being given to patients on two medical care wards			1
we heard from five patients who told us they had been left to wet or soil their beds			1
' the hospital had a high occupancy rate and there had been ongoing use of escalation beds when a ward or unit was full - even though these beds could not meet patients ' needs properly			1
the 64 - page document also said that stroke victims were ' not always given the urgent care they needed '			2
surgical services and outpatient departments also came under the microscope at the hospital managed by @entity198 and @entity197 , which serves 550,000 people			0
' a number of services were not always safe , effective , responsive , caring or well - led , ' stated the @entity36 report			2
' in particular we found that medical care ( including care older people 's care ) was inadequate			2
' there were widespread and significant negative views from patients and staff			0
' the outpatients ' department was found to have infection control risks			0
the main outpatient reception , the floor sinks and the waste bins in the female toilets were not clean			0
the sluice room - a specially designed cleaning room - was cluttered with ' obsolete equipment ' and stacked with used clinical dressing packs			0
the @entity107 was one of the first to be inspected by the @entity36 in the wake of the @entity149 ( pictured ) scandal , following complaints about the level of care there the report said : ' @entity231 entered the sluice with dirty packs , adding to the pile , and left without washing their hands			1
' despite the report beign scathing of the leadership of the hospital , chief executive @entity106 said there was no reason for him to resign			0
he added : ' we accept the broad findings of the report and would like to apologise to those patients who received poor care			2
' clearly it is unacceptable but many of these issues have now been set right			0
' we have put in place a number of changes in relation to staffing and care of the elderly and we have already seen a number of improvements within the last six weeks			2
@entity259 , director of nursing at the @entity107 , added : ' i do n’t want patients to be frightened about coming to hospital			2
' we have recruited more nurses ; 57 newly qualified nurses are now working on our wards and we have new ward sisters who are committed to raising standards			0
