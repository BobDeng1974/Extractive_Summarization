@entity0 have been allowed to name only one club - trained player in their squad for the opening stages of this season 's @entity5 - three less than @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
city , despite having failed @entity13 's @entity12 ruling which meant their squad had to be reduced from 25 to 21 for the tournament , have been allowed to reduce their non-overseas quota to five to compensate for the reduction , according to @entity17			2
clubs in the @entity5 are meant to have at least four ' club - trained ' and four ' association - trained ' players in their 25 - man squads , but @entity13 have seemingly accommodated @entity10 's situation			1
@entity22 has been handed a boost ahead of @entity0 's return to the @entity5 next week after @entity13 allowed their squad 's non-overseas quota to be reduced from 25 to 21 for the tournament @entity5 football returns to the @entity29 when @entity10 host @entity30 on september 30			1
they open their group stage campaign against @entity34 at the @entity35 on wednesday of @entity10 's five non-overseas quota , @entity36 is the only club - trained player , with @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 making up the rest as association - trained players			1
@entity36 , a @entity46 - born midfielder signed as a teenager from @entity48 , has made just 11 @entity50 appearances for @entity10 since joining in 2009			0
he was given a new contract in may to keep him at the club until 2016			0
@entity53 , a football law specialist , told the @entity17 : ' @entity13 have effectively rewritten their home - grown player rule			0
there is nothing in @entity13 or @entity12 regulations about the home - grown rule changing			0
' @entity36 , who has made just 11 @entity50 appearances for @entity10 since joining in 2009 , qualifies as the club - trained player in the @entity5 squad for this season @entity41 , seen here scoring for @entity10 in their win over @entity34 last season , counts as an association - trained player under the @entity68 regulations it is thought that players union @entity70 - with full support of @entity10 - started making overtures to @entity13 that they would potentially take legal action over theoretical restriction of trade			1
@entity13 eventually relaxed the restriction and allowed @entity10 to have five non-overseas players , meaning 16 foreign players rather than the predicted 13			0
the likes of @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity7 may argue that @entity13 have let @entity10 off the hook			2
if @entity5 squad was going to be shrunk from 25 to 21 , this would assume proportionally that eight home - grown players should become seven , not five			2
city believe they have fully complied with @entity13 's rules with regards to the composition of their @entity5 squad .			0

@entity0 have been allowed only one club - trained player in their @entity5 squad for the coming season
this is three fewer than @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8
a @entity97 ruling meant their squad was reduced from 25 to 21 but the governing body has now compensated for this
@entity36 qualifies as @entity10 's club - trained player
city travel to @entity34 for their first group match on wednesday
