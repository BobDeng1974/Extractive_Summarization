a report released by a @entity2 investigative group insists it was a @entity3 missile launcher that shot down flight @entity4 in july killing all 298 passengers			1
searching for @entity7 , a documentary produced by @entity8 ! @entity9 , offers fresh testimonies from military experts , separatist fighters and residents of @entity14			1
they have also collected photo , video and satellite evidence to produce a compelling account of how events unfolded on july 17 last year			1
their findings come just one day after pictures emerged of the @entity25 air force pilot accused by @entity27 rebels of being the man who shot the plane down			1
they say the the armed vehicle entered @entity14 to protect @entity3 armor that had been vulnerable to aerial attack earlier in the conflict - which erupted in april when @entity50 - backed militants seized several government buildings in the @entity52			2
speaking to @entity8 ! @entity9 , military experts claimed only specially - trained troops acting as a tight and well - drilled unit could have operated the @entity34			0
they would have had just seconds , from when they sighted the plane , to switch on their radar and accurately fire the rocket			0
new evidence : searching for @entity7 , a documentary produced by @entity8 ! @entity9 , offers fresh testimonies from military experts , separatist fighters and residents of @entity14 tragic : the crash killed all the 298 people on board the @entity68 , which was en route from @entity70 to @entity71 reporters working for the @entity2 investigative group travelled to the town of @entity75 in east @entity14 , held by @entity50 - backed separatists			1
several people they spoke to in the town described sights and sounds consistent with the launch of a @entity34 missile on the day flight @entity39 crashed			2
one witness went further , claiming he had seen the vehicle and then the missile shooting into the sky afterwards			0
they said : ' they shot it down			0
the missile flew from here			0
we saw it , as it flew			0
i was in the yard and heard an explosion , a bang			0
it was a really loud bang			0
the tiles on my roof shook			0
' then there was a long sound			0
and then a very loud explosion : bang , bang			0
and just as i ran out into the road , the plane began to fall			0
down the road , several kilometers from here			0
and you could see it burn			0
' correct ! @entity9 also interviewed a former @entity113 officer turned separatist commander , @entity112 , who initially told @entity115 his fighters were in possession of a @entity34 , before retracting his statement			0
soft toys are seen near the crash site of the @entity42 flight after it was supposedly shot down in july @entity25 @entity124 employees collect bodies of victims at the site of the crash @entity112 says a @entity34 from @entity3 was sent back after the @entity39 disaster , but his forces are still supported by one @entity34 unit			1
he suggested neither are operated by his militia , claiming they did not have the specialists for such high precision weapons systems			0
however in august , footage shot by a clandestine @entity25 police team showed an image of a @entity34 weapons system on a @entity141 truck being smuggled out of eastern @entity14 in the early hours of july 18 , the day after the plane crash			1
searching for the truth also trashes rival claims by @entity3 authorities that a @entity25 jet downed @entity4			1
the report claims that the type of damage that existed on the wreckage could only have been caused by a surface to air missile			2
rival claim : pro-russian rebels have accused @entity25 pilot captain @entity154 ( above ) of being the ' executioner ' of the 298 victims on board doomed @entity42 flight @entity39 @entity159 has not spoken directly on the loss of @entity39 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible			1
@entity14 blames @entity3 for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him they also conclude that a jet firing on the front of the passenger plane would have to have been travelling from @entity3 airspace - which @entity39 was just 40 kilometers away from entering			1
despite these apparent facts , the @entity3 @entity169 - equivalent of the @entity170 - believe a @entity25 pilot is responsible for the tragedy			1
they are calling for captain @entity154 to take a lie - detector test and face formal questioning , asserting there is compelling evidence against him which should be considered by the @entity181 - led official probe			0
believed to be in his late 20s , he was named by stems from a ' secret witness ' at his @entity185 air base who says the pilot took off in his su - 17 combat jet on 17 july last year armed with air - to - air missiles			1
footage shot by a clandestine @entity25 police team showed an image of a @entity34 weapons system on a @entity141 truck being smuggled out of eastern @entity14 in the early hours of 18 july the report from @entity8 ! @entity9 suggest the @entity196 's are completely untrue			1
aside from new witness testimonies , much of the report 's findings are taken from information already in the public domain - including evidence from reputable open source investigators @entity204			2
@entity205 has spent months gathering and verifying evidence related to @entity3 troop movements in @entity14			1
they geolocated photos of a @entity34 missile launcher on its journey from @entity75 to @entity3 immediately after the @entity39 was downed			2
from this they were able to identify the armed vehicle as belonging to @entity3 's 53rd @entity37 , based in @entity216			2
investigators did so by matching a partially obscured identification number and the unique scratches and dents shown in the @entity222 photos with pictures and footage taken in june of a convoy of @entity3 armour as it drives towards the @entity25 border from @entity216			1
searching for the truth also trashes rival claims by @entity3 authorities that a @entity25 jet downed @entity39 @entity233 , founder of @entity204 , said : ' at this point it 's undeniable the @entity3 military provided the @entity34 it seems that the one key piece of information is autopsy data from the @entity181 criminal investigation			1
' they 've confirmed pieces of metal were found in the bodies , and if they come from a @entity34 warhead then i do n't think there will be any question about who was responsible for shooting down @entity4			2
' the @entity3 @entity169 says @entity25 pilot captain @entity154 took off in his su - 17 combat jet on 17 july last year armed with air - to - air missiles but landed without them - proving their theory he is responsible for the crime			1
@entity154 has not spoken directly on the loss of @entity39 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible			0
@entity14 blames @entity3 for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him .			2

report released by @entity2 investigative group says @entity3 are to blame
searching for @entity7 offers new evidence from experts and witnesses
comes after @entity27 rebels accused @entity25 pilot of downing plane
report trashes this theory , claiming @entity4 was too close to @entity3 air space to have been shot down by @entity25 pilot
