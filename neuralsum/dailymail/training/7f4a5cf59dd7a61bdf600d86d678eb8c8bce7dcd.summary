as @entity2 ’s value continues to rise , hackers have found increasingly sophisticated ways to illegally ‘ mine ’ the virtual currency			1
now a new method has been uncovered which uses malware infected adverts on @entity8 to make computers into @entity2 slaves			1
@entity8 has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts now believe as many as two million @entity15 users could have been affected			1
@entity8 has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts believe there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site in this recent attack , the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ‘ @entity2 mining ’			1
the mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million @entity2 hidden across an internet - based network , which are expected to all be found by 2040			1
to unearth @entity2 , computers have to solve the complex processor - intensive equations which hold them			1
the more powerful the machine the better it is at solving the riddle			0
computer - makers have been creating high - powered souped - up computers so they can do it repeatedly and rapidly to collect the most coins			1
in this recent attack , the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ' @entity46 '			0
the mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million @entity2 hidden across an internet - based network , which are expected to all be found by 2040 @entity2 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity52			1
the currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers			2
@entity2 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			2
but critics say that also makes @entity2 a magnet for drug transactions , money - laundering and other illegal activities			1
a @entity2 investor , @entity67 @entity66 , recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £ 17 of currency four years ago			1
@entity2 mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to collect the virtual currency , without using their own high - powered computers			1
other than a slow computer , those infected with the maleware be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ‘ bitnet ’			0
experts estimate that these criminal networks could be generating as much as $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) each day			0
the value of @entity2 rose to over $ 1000 ( £ 613 ) last year but is currently worth around $ 850 ( £ 520 )			2
unlike traditional banking , @entity2 and its rival virtual currencies , can be bought with near anonymity which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			2
@entity8 has come under for not or doing anything to help those who had been targeted with the malware , which attacked flaws in @entity97 modules on systems			0
@entity99 , the @entity100 cybersecurity firm which first disclosed the vulnerability to the public , estimated that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site			0
users in @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , as well as those using @entity114 @entity113 and mobiles , were n't affected , the group said			0
‘ the attack focused on outdated software , ’ @entity117 of security site @entity116 told the @entity119			0
‘ the only way for the exploits to work is to have outdated versions of @entity97 on your system			0
if @entity97 is up to date , then the odds are , you 're safe			0
‘ however , i do n't trust @entity97 , so unless you absolutely need it , my advice is to uninstall it from your system			0
it seems like i see more zero - day attacks aimed at @entity97 than anything else , the risk is n't worth it for me			0

@entity137 stole computer power to make it easier for criminals to mine @entity2
there are 21 million @entity2 hidden across an internet - based network , which are expected to all be found - or ' mined ' - by 2040
