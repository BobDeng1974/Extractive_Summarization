but when @entity1 realised he had bungled the booking of his wedding , he could n’t face breaking the news to his fiancée , @entity12			0
instead , the panic - stricken groom took desperate measures and phoned the venue to warn there was a bomb about to go off ... in the hope the distraction would prevent her from ever finding out about his mistake			1
@entity1 , who is unemployed , stood by as miss @entity12 , 29 , turned up at historic @entity23 , @entity24 , in her wedding dress , only to find it had been evacuated and was swarming with police			1

’ @entity1 had planned to marry miss @entity12 at @entity42 , which is situated within the listed @entity23 , on april 24			1
the date was pencilled in and the pair were given ‘ right to marry ’ paperwork to complete in order to legalise proceedings			2
but by the time the big day arrived , hapless @entity1 realised he had not filled in the forms and knew the venue was not officially booked			1
instead of telling the truth , he went to a phone box near his home on the morning of the wedding and rang the venue			2
he told the receptionist : ‘ there ’s a bomb in @entity23 and it will go off in 45 minutes ’ , before putting the phone down			1
dozens of people inside were evacuated and bomb disposal units raced to the scene			2
a source said : ‘ he realised he had n’t filled this form in			0
but he had n’t got the heart to tell his missus and her family			2
