by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is too young to be weighed down too much by the burden			0
his first @entity3 has gone well and his status in world football is being elevated every time he comes on and makes an impact , so whatever happens now the @entity8 player should have fond memories of 2014			2
yet even at the age of 23 he is aware of the sense of unfulfilled expectations			0
while the rest of the world is allowing itself to be overwhelmed by the consistency of the @entity20 national team reaching their fourth consecutive @entity3 semi-final , the feeling in @entity15 is somewhat different			1
characteristically the nation is dwelling on what more could be achieved , the feeling being that this generation of players have been in gestation for some time now			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity28 analyses @entity15 's chances ready : @entity1 , who scored in the last 16 against @entity30 , says his side are ready to win the @entity3 through : @entity20 centre - back @entity33 ' header sails over the goalkeeper and in off the bar in reality it is time they gave birth to something special and won a trophy			1
‘ we have this feeling , ’ said @entity1 after the 1 - 0 win against @entity43			1
‘ we are really close and we all feel we have a big chance to win the @entity3			2
in the last few years we have come close in tournaments but now we want to win it			0
' we want to go to the final and win the title ; that was our goal from the beginning			0
it is going to be tough			0
but it does n’t matter who we play , we look at ourselves and how we play			0
’ per @entity60 , the @entity57 centre - half who endured the disappointment of being dropped before the game , has expressed the same thought			0
triumph : @entity33 celebrates beating scoring the quarter - final 's only goal to put @entity15 through all together : the team spirit within the @entity20 squad has developed as this team has grown up together ‘ we finished the last two @entity69 in third position and that is really consistent , ’ said @entity60			1
‘ what we need in @entity15 after all these years is a title			2
we are talking about titles and trophies			0
before the game against @entity43 in the @entity78 , @entity15 manager @entity76 hung up a signed @entity15 shirt from the 1954 team in the dressing room			1
on friday , as they prepared to take on @entity43 , @entity76 wanted to remind his players that it was 60 years to the day that @entity15 had won their first @entity3 , which at the time was a shock performance dubbed the ‘ @entity87 ’ but which laid the foundations of the @entity90 successes of @entity20 football			1
since then there have been @entity3 wins in 1974 and 1990 , along with @entity95 triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996			2
@entity96 : mertesacker , @entity97 and @entity98 celebrate beating @entity43 to reach a fourth consecutive semi-final expectation : 18 years is a long time without a trophy for a team that always reaches the semi-finals but while an 18 - year gap between trophies would be nothing to worry about in @entity107 , for @entity15 it is beginning to nag			1
‘ it ’s quite a performance it you are constantly in the semi-final , ’ said @entity76 on friday night			2
but he was aware of the subtext of the questioning and added : ‘ and yes , we will try to make the next step			0
’ this is the @entity20 generation that came of age in 2009 , winning in the @entity120 - 21 championships in @entity121 against @entity107			1
in the final that night in @entity125 their team included @entity98 , @entity126 , @entity33 , @entity127 and @entity128 , all of whom started against @entity43 and who represent the heart of @entity15 now			1
the @entity107 team , beaten comprehensively 4 - 0 that night , included only @entity134 and @entity135 who now feature for @entity107 , though @entity136 would have played had he not been suspended for the final			2
@entity137 analyses @entity15 's chances superb : @entity98 's strng save in the final moments against @entity43 has earned him plenty of praise it was @entity98 and @entity33 who took the plaudits in the @entity78			1
@entity98 is so good ‘ he could play in midfield for @entity15 ’ said @entity76 , referring to the ‘ sweeper - keeper ’ style of the @entity20 no 1			1
his ability to pass with his feet allows him to come well out of his box to clear up long balls , which permits the @entity20 back four to push up high			2
‘ he is the best in the world , ’ said his @entity157 team - mate @entity156			0
his last - minute save , pushing away @entity162 ’s strike , was almost nonchalant , a throwback to @entity164 and @entity165 , goalkeepers schooled in handball who had that ability to stand tall and simply punch balls away			0
‘ i try to copy the style of a handball goalkeeper when a forward is one on one , ’ said @entity98 , who played the game at school			0
there was some respite for @entity15 in the euphoria of the quarter - final win			1
until now , @entity76 and his team have endured criticism in @entity15 for the style of their football against @entity183 and the unconvincing manner of their win against @entity30			1
golden generation : @entity98 has progressed through from the @entity189 squad with many in this team ‘ if other teams won the @entity3 this way they would be seen as clever , ’ said @entity192			2
‘ people would rave about them			0
' i do n’t want to end up winning the @entity3 and find that we have to be apologising for it , saying : “ sorry we only won the final 1 - 0			1
” ’ @entity192 need not worry			0
the mood has eased somewhat after victory against @entity43 and @entity15 seem to be evolving into something impressive here			1
the hosts will be without @entity205 and @entity206 for tuesday ’s semi-final in @entity208 and it now looks , with their creative spark gone , that only sheer willpower and determination will get @entity213 over the line to the final			1
for @entity15 , the opportunities are suddenly opening up			0
@entity218 can be replaced - ronaldo			0

@entity15 have reached four @entity3 semi-finals in a row
but last trophy came at @entity224
@entity20 performances have not overwhelmed public at home
@entity76 's men beat @entity43 in quarter - final , face @entity213 in semis
