fine : @entity6 in @entity7 will add the additional charge to the cost of a ceremony if the time between the hearse arriving and the last mourners ' cars departing exceeds 40 minutes he said : ' it is not nice - we were annoyed about it because it came through on our invoice			1
' they had just snuck it on , no - one was ringing us up saying the service over-ran			0
' and if the service is shorter than expected , the crematorium does not give money back to families			0
' a funeral is not like a kids ’ birthday party			2
' people are distressed but they are just saying " you have 40 minutes , get in and get out " , it ’s not right			0
mr @entity14 added that funeral directors are losing money because they do not wish to impose the fines on customers			1
he said : ' funeral directors have been paying the charge rather than putting it on the bill , but it means our fees might have to be increased to cover it			1
' it would be horrendous for us to put it on the bill			0
how can you justify that to the families ? controversial : @entity15 funeral director @entity14 says that the fine is ' not morally defensible ' , and has been added without warning ' they have just paid £ 2,000 and then we give them an extra fee			1
' @entity66 , procurement and services delivery manager at @entity69 which runs the crematorium , explained that funerals are booked in 40 minute slots			0
services should last 30 minutes , allowing an additional 10 minutes for mourners to come and go			0
but he said that services can be extended by an additional 30 minutes if prearranged			0
he said : ' it is the funeral director ’s responsibility to assess the bereaved family ’s needs and book the appropriate length of service accordingly			0
' he added : ' all funeral directors were informed of these changes by letter before they were introduced			1
so far the council has only received complaints from three funeral directors out of a total of 81 in the area , according to mr @entity14 .			1

@entity6 in @entity7 introduced the fine in april
but local funeral directors have been paying the fee themselves
@entity14 says it is ' too horrendous ' to add fine to mourners ' bills
