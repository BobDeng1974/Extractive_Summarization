by @entity0 published : 00:48 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 09:22 est , 6 june 2012 @entity1 are in for a cyber-surprise on wednesday : they 'll be able to plug family names into an online 1940 @entity1 census and come up with details about the lives of @entity7 - from @entity8 and @entity9 to their own relatives			1
starting after midnight , it will no longer be essential to provide exact addresses from seven decades ago to look for a @entity7 connection			2
with names , free searches of the 1940 @entity1 census first made public in april will unlock personal information about residents of @entity7 - then the largest @entity1 state and an immigrant hub from which people moved all over the country			1
famous residents : one entry in the 1940 census is for @entity26 , shown eighth from the bottom on the left hand side ; he is one of many notable @entity7 who are searchable online now @entity7 's young : @entity31 , a young @entity9 watches a horse race in 1939 ; and right , pictured in 1960 as @entity9 ; the @entity9 's records and many more are now searchable online censused : this @entity1 @entity35 ledger page shows an entry for @entity9 , second from top maiden name : @entity9 , who became @entity9 when she married @entity40 @entity35 experts say the @entity7 data is of national interest because tens of millions of @entity1 have roots in this gateway to the @entity1 through @entity46 , and many can now dig for more personal information			1
' that 's the exciting aspect about this - the ability to search the lifetime of our mothers and fathers , ' said @entity55 , a @entity7 - based independent forensic genealogist with clients seeking information for trust funds and estates			1
when the census was first released , ' if you did n't know exactly where someone lived in 1940 , you could n't find them , ' ms @entity55 told the @entity0 indexing by name is crucial to cracking the until - now closed book of that year 's census , which by law could not be released for 72 years and is therefore the most recently available one			2
this @entity1 census leads to @entity71			0
helping @entity72 : a poster advertises the 1940 census telling @entity1 of the importance in participating in the ' ten - year roll call ' taking down numbers : an enumerator interviews a woman for the @entity35 ; the @entity35 plus the 1915 and 1925 @entity80 are now searchable online by family name , without needing often forgotten addresses from seven decades ago some of the work of transcribing handwritten census records into a computerized index was done by workers in an office outside the southern city of @entity90 with ' very strong character recognition abilities , ' said @entity92 , who heads the document preservation service at @entity94 , a @entity95 , @entity96 - based family history company that 's releasing the online @entity98 census for 1940 using their new name index			1
' given the complexity of their own language , reading and recognizing characters from other languages comes easier , ' he said			0
also wednesday , another historic treasure trove appears on the internet for the first time : census information compiled separately by @entity98 for 1915 and 1925 , indexed by name			2
these records include details about famed personalities such as @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , who according to the 1925 census was born in the @entity1 , even though most biographies say he was born in @entity120			2
the interest in roots is so intense that 37 million hits temporarily crashed the @entity125 provider site when the 1940 census was released on april 2			1
many who logged on hoping for results hit the wall , frustrated for lack of specific locations required for results			0
a different era : in 1940 , the @entity1 was still recovering from the @entity134 and entered @entity135 a year later political prowess : other data includes the 1925 census data for former @entity7 mayor @entity139 , appearing at the top of the page at right the athlete and the wordsmith : @entity145 , left , and author @entity146 , right , were in the city at the time of the census ms @entity55 , a @entity150 resident , uncovered details about her 84 - year - old father 's family because he remembered his family 's @entity155 address before his bar mitzvah in 1940 , when he was 13			1
' his memory was spot on , ' his daughter said			0
but the @entity155 childhood address her mother remembered did n't match , so they will try to find the information again this week			0
former @entity7 mayor @entity139 hit the jackpot when it came to his family history , which is contained in all three censuses - the federal one , as well as the @entity7 ones from 1915 and 1925			1
the 87 - year - old @entity139 participated in a preview search conducted by @entity94 , which is making all three census records available online			2
his said his father came from @entity174 , alone at age 16 , eventually raising a family in a @entity178 apartment			0
for years , ' i told people that we lived in abject poverty , ' he said			0
a series of census records from the time would prove him wrong			2
notable @entity7 : jazz legend @entity187 , left , and actress @entity188 , right , lived in @entity7 at the time of the 1940 census the times are a-changing : hundreds of @entity7 are seen swarming @entity192 in 1940 they showed that the depression - era rent for the @entity196 ' five - room @entity178 apartment was $ 75 a month , ' and that was a lot of money at the time , ' @entity139 said			1
' all my life , i was telling people i was very poor , but i learned we did not live in abject poverty ; i was born into a middle - class family , ' he said			0
the @entity98 world of the 1940 census includes names that later became famous , including @entity188 , @entity208 , @entity146 , @entity9 and @entity187			1
the 1940 census by name index will be available for all states possibly as early as this fall			1
while @entity98 is the biggest state whose census records are already name - indexed , a number of smaller states also have been made name - accessible by @entity94 and two other companies , @entity219 and @entity220			0
@entity7 state censuses for 1915 and 1925 are available online for the first time via a link that says ' find family history for free ' to anyone providing a @entity7 zip code and email address			1
the state censuses show ' every @entity7 from the famous to the infamous to everybody in between , ' said @entity232 , director of archives and records management at the @entity234			1
a perfect example of this melting pot is @entity237 , who at 17 appeared in the 1925 census as ' @entity237 , ' living by the @entity239 near @entity240 , which would later be dubbed ' @entity240			0
' family ties : independent forensic genealogist @entity55 located her family 's data in the 1940 census data earlier this year when her now 84 - year - old father remembered his 1940 street address ; now , they can search only by name digital era : after midnight wednesday , @entity1 will be able to plug family names into an online 1940 @entity1 census and come up with details about the lives of @entity7 the @entity237 family neighbour was @entity255 , an @entity256 immigrant working in manufacturing and his @entity259 - born wife , the census shows			1
' so here was the future @entity1 baseball hero living next door to an immigrant family making it in the @entity1 , ' @entity232 said			0
' what a great @entity1 story ! and that 's what you can find out walking through a neighbourhood with census records			0

the census data also include such information as occupation , whether immigrants were naturalized citizens , and whether they owned or rented their homes - in other words , sketches of communities , said @entity287 , president of @entity288 , a @entity7 - based genealogy technology firm			2
