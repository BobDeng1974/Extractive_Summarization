@entity0 have rejected proposals to ban abortions on the grounds of gender amid claims it would make it harder for women from @entity10 communities to seek help			1
the change , in an amendment to the @entity14 , was last night defeated by 291 votes to 201			0
the proposed ban was tabled by @entity18 mp @entity17 but was dealt a major blow when shadow home secretary @entity20 wrote to labour mps urging them to vote against it			1
the proposed ban was tabled by @entity18 mp @entity17 but was dealt a major blow when shadow home secretary @entity20 ( right ) wrote to labour mps urging them to vote against it miss @entity20 said that to support the change would make ‘ vulnerable women ’ less likely to have ‘ open and honest conversations ’ with doctors and nurses			1
@entity31 also said it could stop women being able to ‘ avoid the certainty of genetic disease ’			0
last night ’s vote centred on plans to make it crystal clear that sex - selective terminations are illegal			1
critics insist that the existing legislation on the issue is confusing and that terminations based on the sex of the foetus are still going on in some communities			2
more than 100 @entity0 have put their name to the amendment tabled by mrs @entity17 , who said it was needed ‘ to stop women being misled , to send a strong signal , and to provide an opportunity for government help ’			2
the @entity54 has urged @entity56 mps to oppose a ban on sex - selective abortion which will be debated today but miss @entity20 claimed the move would make it impossible to terminate a child suffering from sex - specific abnormalities			1
in her letter to @entity0 , she wrote : ‘ concerns have been raised that some women are put under intense pressure by their partners , families or communities to deliver male children			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity17 ’s amendment will do little to alleviate the external pressures or coercion these women face , nor eradicate prejudices , customs and traditions which are based on the idea of the inferiority of women and which may amount to pressure to seek an abortion because of the sex of a foetus			2
‘ some organisations have raised concern that @entity87 ’s amendment would simply make vulnerable women less likely to have open and honest conversations with healthcare professionals about their circumstances , making it harder to get them support			0
’ @entity18 mp @entity17 has tabled an amendment which will clarify the law on gender - selective abortion miss @entity20 instead called on @entity0 to support a rival amendment which called for a thorough assessment of the evidence on sex - selective abortion , together with a new government plan to promote cultural change			1
at a @entity18 rally in @entity105 , mr @entity31 said he supported the ‘ status quo ’ whereby abortion on gender grounds is not legal but could be allowed in some cases			2
‘ now , there are very few circumstances , for example avoiding the certainty of genetic disease , that it might be allowed , so i support that , ’ he said			0
‘ but in doing so , i hope that the abortion rules are properly policed and prosecutions and all the rest of it are carried out when the laws are broken			0
’ miss @entity17 ’s amendment to the @entity14 attempted to make sure that nothing in the @entity127 ‘ is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child ’			0
it would have meant that women who have abortions in these circumstances and the doctors who approve them could be liable for criminal prosecution			0
last night @entity134 , director of @entity135 – which campaigns against sex - selective abortions – called the vote a ‘ disgrace ’			1
‘ this is an insult to the women we work with who have suffered under the burden of sex - selective abortion and have said they want clarity in the law , ’ she said			1
‘ to think that a few @entity149 bubble @entity0 could scupper such an important vote mocks the very fabric of @entity153 democracy			0

prime minister insists existing law on abortions is strong enough
@entity18 mp @entity17 is seeking a ban on gender - selective abortions
