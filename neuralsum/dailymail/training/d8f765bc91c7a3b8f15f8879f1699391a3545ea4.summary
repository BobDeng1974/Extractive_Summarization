by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:47 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 23 october 2012 the warden of the prison where @entity4 puts inmates to death says the state 's execution table can easily hold a condemned 480 - pound inmate who has argued he is so big it might collapse			1
the table was tested by placing a prison employee who weighs the same amount as inmate @entity14 on it as well as extra weights and it remained standing			1
@entity17 argues his weight , vein access , scar tissue , depression and other medical problems raise the likelihood his executioners would encounter severe problems			1
' the execution table held firmly and showed no signs of instability , ' wrote @entity30 , warden at the @entity31 in @entity32 , in a court filing			2
big problem : death row inmate @entity14 , 53 , who weights 480lbs with a scheduled date for execution set for january of 2013 claims he 's too big to be easily and humanely killed judging by the two tests , mr @entity30 said he is confident the table ' can and will accommodate the weight of @entity17 for his scheduled execution			1
' there is also the question of how much @entity17 actually weighs , since his lawyers reported that he weighs 480 pounds but the state reports that he weighed 396 pounds just last week			0
@entity17 , 53 , is scheduled to die january 16 for the 1983 shooting death of @entity48 in @entity49			1
the victim â€™s son , @entity50 , has called @entity17 's arguments ' laughable			0
' @entity17 's attorneys also want more time to pursue arguments that claims of a full confession by the inmate to several people have been falsely exaggerated			2
' indeed , given his unique physical and medical condition , there is a substantial risk that any attempt to execute him will result in serious physical and psychological pain to him , as well as an execution involving a torturous and lingering death , ' a court filing said last month			0
breakable : a gurney is seen at a @entity72 , similar to one in @entity4 which posts claims he could also break if placed on due to his size mr @entity30 said he successfully tested the strength of the table with an employee who weighed 420 pounds , and later by piling 540 pounds of weight on the table			1
the table straps easily fit around the employee , @entity30 said			0
the state is also questioning the validity of arguments in favor of sparing @entity17 made by a doctor who did not examine him			0
the state says @entity17 has n't presented evidence he ca n't be put to death ' in a humane and dignified manner			2
' @entity4 is also challenging @entity17 's arguments on technical grounds , saying he has exhausted his claims before federal courts and should n't be allowed to make this new argument			0
@entity4 executes inmates with a single dose of pentobarbital , usually injected through the arms			0
escaped death : in 1994 @entity106 , who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death , had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation arguments : @entity113 , who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008 , argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible medical personnel have had a hard time inserting ivs into @entity17 's arms , according to a court filing			1
four years ago , an @entity125 medical center nurse needed three attempts to insert an iv into his left arm , the lawyers wrote			0
@entity17 has tried losing weight , but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise , according to his court filing			2
@entity17 's request for gastric bypass surgery has been denied , he has been encouraged not to walk because he 's at risk for falling , and severe depression has contributed to his inability to limit how much he eats , his filing said			0
while at the @entity143 , @entity17 ' used that prison 's exercise bike until it broke under his weight , ' according to the filing .			1

death row inmate @entity14 claims his weight , vein access and scar tissue would *prevent* a humane execution
@entity17 , arrested in 1983 , claims he had used a prison exercise bike to lose weight until it broke *beneath* him
prison warden tested the strength of the table and said it could hold him
