nothing for victims : the £ 3million left in @entity3 's estate will be spent on lawyers almost two - thirds of the damages claims made for alleged sexual assaults by @entity3 have so far been rejected			1
lawyers representing @entity9 , the executors of @entity3 ’s will , told the @entity12 last week that out of 58 claims which have so far been considered under a controversial compensation scheme , 36 have been thrown out , and just 22 accepted			1
the scheme , set up by the bank , was approved in april by a high court judge , and then advertised in newspapers			0
the hearing also confirmed that the whole of @entity3 ’s estate is certain to be swallowed up in legal fees – leaving nothing for genuine victims			1
last month , @entity24 revealed that police have launched a criminal inquiry into a claim from @entity29 ’s great - niece , @entity28 , who says he abused her when she was aged 12 and 15			0
members of her family , including her daughter , have told police they believe her allegations are false			0
the court heard that of the £ 3 million left in @entity3 ’s estate , just over £ 1 million is due to @entity9 ’s solicitors , @entity40			1
there are more than 150 claims that still have to be processed , and under the scheme ’s terms , another £ 2 million will be due to the law firms that represent alleged victims			1
@entity40 ’s bills take precedence over all other claims on the estate			2
but victims deemed to be genuine can not receive a penny until all compensation claims are complete – by which time the pot will be empty			1
last week ’s hearing was a bid by the @entity57 , the charity to which @entity3 left almost all his money , to get the compensation scheme quashed and @entity9 removed as executors			1
the three judges expressed astonishment at the way the scheme works , and at the low level of scrutiny for weeding out fraudulent claims			2
a small group of ‘ consultants ’ is being given only two - line summaries of each claim , containing few details			0
the judges also pressed @entity9 ’s lawyers to explain how the scheme ’s ‘ tariff ’ of damages – which provides for payouts from £ 1,500 to £ 60,000 , as well as the enormous associated legal fees – had been calculated			1
the judges said the bank had an ‘ obligation ’ to provide evidence of this , but @entity9 failed to do so , saying only that the scheme had emerged after months of ‘ negotiation ’			0
it was clear the hearing itself will only add to the dizzying legal costs			0
claims : police have launched a criminal inquiry into a claim from @entity29 ’s great - niece who says he abused her when she was aged 12 and 15			2
members of her family have told police they believe her allegations are false there were seven qcs in court , representing the @entity57 , @entity9 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 ’s and some of the alleged victims , as well as numerous solicitors and junior barristers			2
lady justice @entity110 , one of three judges hearing the application , commented : ‘ there are so many lawyers at this party , i cringe			0
’ the @entity57 had tried to ensure that there would only be its own lawyers and those representing the bank in attendance , but the bank rejected this , describing the suggestion as ‘ preposterous ’			0
@entity9 and @entity40 have refused to comment			0

58 damages claims have been considered under scheme for alleged victims
there are more than 150 claims that still have to be processed
the £ 3million left in @entity3 's estate is due to be spent on lawyers
victims deemed to be genuine can not receive money until all are complete
by which time there will be no money left in the estate for them to claim
