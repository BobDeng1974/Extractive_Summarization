as fearsome killers , @entity1 members do not have the cuddliest of reputations			2
but actually they are more sensitive , family - orientated and selfless than other murderers , research has found			2
a study of inmates in a prison in the home of the @entity1 , @entity12 , showed that unlike other violent prisoners , criminals with links to the mob were not psychopathic			1
@entity17 ( left ) played a mafioso on @entity19 who balanced his love for his family with his callousness as a don ; real - life mafioso @entity26 ( right ) was eventually sent to prison for tax evasion the @entity30 researchers compared 30 @entity1 with 39 @entity32 criminals			1
they found that the @entity1 tended to compartmentalise their lives and feelings : on the one hand , their vicious criminal activities and on the other , their warm emotions towards relatives and friends			1
the research , published in the magazine @entity41 , echoes the character of @entity43			0
in hit @entity45 mob show @entity19 viewers saw him struggle to balance the love for his family with his criminal pursuits			2
around half of the mafiosi questioned were serving time for violent offences , one quarter were murderers and the rest were convicted of crimes such as kidnapping , trafficking drugs and fraud			2
professor @entity60 , who led the study said : ' our findings bring new hope for re-socialisation of convicted @entity1 members , because they showed significant antisocial traits but they maintained a capacity for emotional connection and greater likelihood of engaging with training and re-socialisation programmes than other imprisoned offenders in @entity30			1
further , during the interviews , they often expressed concerns for their children and their families , and they had never ceased to write and call them			0
the @entity19 featuring @entity80 ( right ) and @entity81 ' such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men			0
' they were also less likely to have addiction problems than other prisoners , he said			0
‘ @entity1 members are required to appear reliable , maintain power and adhere to the internal representations and principles of their organisation , and such skills tend to be impaired by substance use			0
' it may be that substance misusers would be less likely to be selected for @entity98 ( as they would be viewed as liabilities ) , and if selected by chance , their involvement would be short lived			0
’ @entity103 : beautiful but home to some of the world 's deadliest killers but at least they are nice to their families the @entity30 researchers studied 30 mafiosi in a prison in @entity112 , @entity12 and compared them with 39 criminals convicted for other crimes			1
the subjects were psychologically analysed using an assessment system called the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) which measures psychotic characteristics			0
those who receive a score over 30 are considered a psychopath - none of the @entity1 members scored over 30 in the researchers ' test .			1

mafioso nice to family and friends unlike non- ' made ' killers
able to compartmentalise feelings between ' business ' and home life
@entity30 researchers compared 30 mafiosi with 39 other criminals
