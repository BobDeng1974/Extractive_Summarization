@entity1 is to cut the drink drive limit making it illegal to drive after drinking a half pint of beer @entity23 has already announced plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in a bid to tackle the problem of binge drinking			1

proposals to lower the limit were announced by @entity1 justice secretary @entity40 earlier this year			2
a public consultation will be launched today			0
the move was cautiously welcomed by road safety campaigners , as a zero - tolerance approach is their ultimate aim			0
@entity48 , general manager at road safety charity brake , said : ' whilst 50mg is a step in the right direction , what we really need to see is a strong message from our governments in @entity1 and @entity55 to say that not a drop is acceptable if you are behind the wheel			2
the power to change the drink drive laws was transferred to @entity23 earlier this year as part of the @entity37 ' far too many lives are lost on @entity18 roads annually because of drink drivers			1

' having secured the powers to take this forward through the @entity37 , the @entity73 , as a priority , will bring forward proposals later this year , with a view to the change taking effect as soon as possible			0
