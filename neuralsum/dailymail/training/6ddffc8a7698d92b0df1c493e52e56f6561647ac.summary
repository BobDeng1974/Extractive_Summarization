once again , the @entity1 delivered high drama on saturday as champions @entity3 were beaten at @entity4 , @entity0 crushed @entity5 to move to within a point of the @entity7 at the top of the table and @entity10 claimed a bonus - point home win against @entity12			2
the matches , following friday ’s thunderous and damaging @entity16 - @entity15 encounter at @entity17 , also provided further pointers for @entity20 head coach @entity19 as he prepares to name a revised @entity21 next week			2
with the @entity24 opener against @entity25 in @entity26 looming on february 6 , here is a run - down of the current selection issues … @entity29 is primed to reclaim his no 8 jersey for @entity20 's @entity24 opener against @entity25 in @entity26 @entity32 is likely to miss the entire @entity24 after the @entity16 forward broke a leg against @entity15 @entity32 was named @entity20 's player of the series after his superb display against @entity37 in november tight - five tussle @entity39 is back in action for @entity3 but he was in a beaten pack in @entity42 , not least in the scrum , and contributed to a team performance awash with basic handling errors			1
@entity46 is on course to retain the no 1 shirt ahead of his @entity50 loosehead rival			2
@entity51 of @entity12 is the form hooker in the country — while rival @entity54 has been serving a ban — but his fellow @entity58 , @entity57 , missed the defeat at @entity10 and is unlikely to have time to usurp @entity0 ’s @entity61 at tighthead			1
in the second row , with @entity65 poised for an imminent @entity7 comeback , he and @entity63 , who reached a century of appearances for @entity0 against @entity5 , are sure to continue their effective partnership , while @entity70 continues his injury rehab			1
@entity20 loosehead @entity39 ( left ) is back in action for @entity3 after a long injury lay - off @entity73 maintained his fine form for @entity12 in the tussle for the replacement lock role , after @entity77 was sin - binned for a dangerous tackle on friday night			1
@entity39 , @entity79 and @entity80 are most likely to provide the front - row cover			2
@entity82 ( @entity10 ) ; @entity83 ( @entity0 ) , @entity84 ( @entity3 ) , @entity85 ( @entity15 ) , @entity86 ( @entity16 ) ; @entity87 ( @entity0 ) , @entity88 ( @entity10 ) ; @entity46 ( @entity10 ) , @entity51 ( @entity12 ) , @entity61 ( @entity0 ) ; @entity89 ( @entity0 ) , @entity65 ( @entity3 ) ; @entity90 ( @entity3 ) , @entity91 ( capt , @entity10 ) , @entity29 ( @entity15 ) back - row blow the savage blow to @entity32 , who had surgery on saturday after breaking his left leg at @entity17 the night before , means @entity29 will return to @entity20 ’s starting xv against @entity25			1
@entity10 ’ win generated renewed calls for @entity99 to be considered for a recall at the age of 36 after his latest supreme performance			0
@entity99 said : ‘ clearly the door ’s been pretty much shut for quite a while , but as long as you are playing , there is always an option			0
it is up to the selectors — sometimes your face fits , sometimes it does n’t			0
’ @entity0 lock @entity89 looks set to continue his second row partnership with @entity65 unfortunately for @entity114 , it appears that his face does n’t fit , despite his stellar form			1
as the summer approaches , @entity117 will consider bringing @entity119 in from his @entity121 exile , and the coaches are bound to call up @entity123 of @entity5 when the mighty @entity125 qualifies on residency next year			0
captain @entity91 played well on his @entity10 comeback on saturday and he is surely secure at openside , despite @entity130 ’s personal resurgence at @entity16			2
@entity90 deserves to keep the blindside berth and @entity132 can cover all bases from the bench			2
half - back duel it was a setback for @entity15 and @entity20 when @entity137 had to pull out of friday ’s game in the @entity139 with a tight calf			1
club and country need him to string together a long run of matches at @entity146			0
however , @entity20 can take heart from @entity87 ’s sensational form at fly - half — with the master - class he produced against @entity5 being the latest example			1
the @entity0 playmaker is riding the crest of a wave after his autumn exploits and he continues to find ways to carve open the best defences			0
@entity87 is @entity20 's form fly half at present and looks set to start against the @entity159 in @entity26 while @entity162 is struggling to break into the @entity12 team and revive his game , @entity160 and @entity161 are vying for the final squad fly - half place			1
@entity160 won the duel between the pair on saturday , partly thanks to his pack ’s controlling influence but also because his distribution , decision - making and kicking were assured			0
at scrum - half , @entity88 eclipsed @entity173 at @entity174 , but again he had his forwards to thank for creating the platform			2
their battle for supremacy will go on and on			0
outside - back race the midfield conundrum never ends			0
@entity182 was again absent from @entity12 ’s line - up and he is likely to miss the start of the @entity24 , which is a major blow to @entity117			0
@entity186 was missing from the @entity0 side and while @entity188 excelled as his try - scoring deputy he will continue to learn a new code before the test call - up inevitably comes			0
@entity84 has impressed for the @entity7 in recent months and looks set to start at outside centre @entity84 was untidy and hesitant at @entity4 , but his form has been so good all season that it is fair to regard his display as a brief blip			1
on friday , @entity198 had one of those games that so infuriates the @entity20 coaches ; classy one minute , sloppy and rash the next			0
it is hard to see him retaining his starting place at 12			0
@entity85 is due back for @entity15 next weekend and he will surely join forces with @entity84 , although @entity206 and @entity207 warrant consideration			1
providing they are all fit , @entity20 are unlikely to find any reason to change their most recent back - three unit of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity86 .			1

@entity50 and @entity20 prop @entity39 is back in action for @entity3
@entity51 is likely to start against @entity25 at hooker
@entity65 and @entity89 are set to continue in the second row
@entity29 is set to join @entity90 and @entity91 in the back row
@entity88 is primed to reclaim his spot at scrum half
@entity87 is *unquestionably* @entity20 form fly half
@entity160 should be called up to the @entity20 senior squad
@entity85 and @entity84 look set to link up in midfield
@entity82 , @entity83 and @entity86 are set to continue out wide
