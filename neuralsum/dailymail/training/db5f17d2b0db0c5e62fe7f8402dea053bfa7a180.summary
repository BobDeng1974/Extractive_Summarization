by @entity0 last updated at 10:41 pm on 12th october 2011 @entity3 's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an @entity7 bailout fund this week , the main opposition leader said today - just one day after parliament rejected the proposal , causing the government to fall			1
@entity11 , head of @entity12 , said that in exchange for his party 's votes , three outgoing government party leaders have agreed to hold early general elections on march 10			1
he said : ' @entity3 will ratify the @entity7 bailout fund without any problems			1
i believe it will happen on friday this week at the latest , ' collapsed : in a desperate effort to force a vote in favour of the bailout fund , prime minister @entity22 tied it to a confidence vote - the one - year - old government subsequently collapsed tuesday 's vote on the bail out failed because a junior coalition party , the @entity31 , was against it			1
in a desperate effort to force that party to vote in favour of the bailout fund , prime minister @entity22 tied the vote to a confidence vote - but it failed causing her one - year - old government to collapse			1
with the government defunct - and with the promise of early elections - @entity11 said his party will now vote in favour of the bailout fund , which all 16 other members of the eurozone have already supported			1
the leaders of three coalition parties - @entity48 of the @entity49 , which @entity22 belongs to ; @entity50 of the @entity51 and @entity52 of a party of ethnic @entity54 - confirmed the deal			1
' we had to pay a political price			0
and the early election is the price			2
' just one day after parliament rejected the proposal causing the government to fall , @entity3 's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an @entity7 bailout opposition party leader , and former prime minister , @entity11 said : ' @entity3 will ratify the @entity7 bailout fund without any problems			1
i believe it will happen on friday this week at the latest ' the announcement came hours after @entity7 president @entity75 and @entity77 president @entity76 called on @entity3 political parties ' to rise above the positioning of short - term politics , and seize the next occasion to ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement			2
' they said the enhancement of the â‚¬ 44billion euro @entity86 is crucial ' to preserve financial stability in the euro area			0
and that is in the interest of all euro countries , including the @entity3 people			0
' @entity94 leaders had agreed in july to increase the size and powers of the bailout fund , giving it the ability to lend quickly to governments in case of market trouble in order to contain the stubborn financial crisis			0
@entity11 's populist leftist party is by far the strongest political force in @entity3 and stands a good chance to win the early ballot			1
it won last year 's general elections in june with 34.8 percent of the vote , taking 62 seats in the 150 - seat @entity113			1
the senior party of the outgoing coalition , the @entity49 , was well behind in second , with 15.4 percent , or 28 seats			2
@entity11 's party campaigned on a promise to maintain the country 's welfare state even as other @entity122 countries slash their budgets to deal with the economic crisis			1
during his term of prime minister between 2006 and 2010 , @entity3 adopted the euro currency in 2009			0
despite him taking the largest share of the vote in the 2010 election , four opposition parties with a majority of 79 parliamentary seats agreed to form a ruling coalition			0
mr @entity11 and his party had always supported expanding the fund expansion in principle , but had said it would vote ' yes ' only if the government agreed to call early elections			1
as major eurozone policies need the approval of all 17 countries that use the currency , @entity3 's vote - the last - carried immense weight			2
for weeks it appeared certain it would reject boosting the bailout fund , unnerving financial markets and threatening the future of @entity122 's plans to fight the crisis			2
experts said @entity7 officials could possibly find a way around a @entity159 rejection of the bill to boost the powers and size of the bailout fund , the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , but that doing so would carry costs to @entity122 unity			2
in the longer - term , the drama seems sure to add momentum to the push for nimbler rules to govern the 17 - country eurozone , where government reaction to the unfolding crisis has seemed for many months to be behind the curve			0
that push has been gathering momentum for some time			0
charts key economic data for @entity178 in august , the leaders of @entity180 and @entity181 , president @entity182 and chancellor @entity183 , proposed that the heads of the eurozone countries elect the president of a new ' economic government ' who would direct regular summits to respond to the continent 's financial crisis			2
president of the @entity77 , decried what he called ' the constraint of unanimity '			0
mr @entity76 told the @entity113 : ' the pace of our joint endeavour can not be dictated by the slowest			0
' at issue now is an agreement reached by the eurozone leaders in july to enlarge the @entity86 's capital guarantee from 440billion to 780billion euro			0
@entity3 would contribute about 1 per cent , or 7.7billion euro			0
in addition , if the changes are approved , the facility would have new powers and able to prop up government bond markets and help put new capital reserves against losses in banks			0
although 16 countries have given the thumbs - up , approval of the changes has found itself in potential jeopardy because of the opposition of a junior member of @entity3 's governing coalition , the @entity31			0
the party 's chairman , @entity216 , had called the expanded bailout fund ' a road to hell ' and vowed to block			1

@entity11 , head of @entity12 , said that in exchange for his party 's votes on @entity7 bail out there will be early general elections on march 10
the deal comes just one day after parliament rejected the proposal , causing the government to fall
