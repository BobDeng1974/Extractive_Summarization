claim : @entity1 @entity0 , 33 , has launched the health and safety claim against the owner of the station in @entity5 , @entity6 , where she tripped on a 6in kerb a policewoman who answered a midnight call to a suspected burglary is suing the man who dialled 999 – because she tripped over a kerbstone			1
@entity1 @entity0 is seeking a potential five - figure payout after claiming the owner of a petrol station failed to keep her safe as she investigated the possible break - in			1
her claim that the 999 call exposed her to ‘ an unnecessary risk of injury ’ raises new questions about the extent of @entity21 ’s compensation culture , and has wide - reaching implications for anyone who calls the emergency services to their property			1
@entity28 , 33 , has hired a top firm of @entity31 solicitors specialising in personal injury lawsuits – but her health - and - safety claim has shocked mps , who have branded the lawsuit ‘ bizarre ’			1
petrol station owner @entity36 is enraged by the @entity1 ’s action against him , saying : ‘ i am incredulous that i am being sued by a police officer whose duty is to protect the public			1
‘ how can anyone feel safe calling the cops if they size you up for compensation while they ’re fighting crime ? ' surely policing has elements of both public service and risk			2
is n’t that what officers sign up for when they put on the uniform – chasing villains and keeping us safe ? ’ @entity28 tripped on a 6in kerb as she was checking the petrol station in @entity5 , @entity6 , with the owner			1
he said : ‘ i thought nothing of it – other than she must have been a bit embarrassed – and i helped her up			0
then we carried on with the search			0
’ mr @entity36 , 50 , had called 999 after the alarm went off at @entity66 ’ @entity67 on august 25 last year			1
he had put the incident out of his mind – until he received a three - page letter from @entity28 ’s lawyers @entity71 last week			1
incident : @entity36 called 999 after the alarm was triggered at @entity74 , where the policewoman tripped on the 6in kerb ( pictured ) in good spirits : @entity28 pictured on saturday			1
she appeared in good health , carrying bags of shopping , but refused to answer questions about the case the document made a total of 11 allegations against him – including that he failed to turn the lights on or warn her of the kerb			0
she says she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall – although she was well enough to continue the search of the garage at the time			2
mr @entity36 is accused of ‘ failing to ensure [ @entity28 ] was reasonably safe in using the premises for which she was permitted / invited by you to be there ’ and of a ‘ failure to carry out any and / or adequate risk assessment ’			1
the letter concludes the 999 call - out ‘ exposed our client to an unnecessary risk of injury ’			1
@entity106 , chairman of the powerful @entity107 , is now demanding urgent @entity109 guidelines on the issue			0
he said : ‘ this civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police out to their premises to help them in an emergency			1
part one : the letter that mr @entity36 received from @entity28 's lawyers @entity71 last week ‘ it is in the public interest to know where exactly people stand in circumstances like this			1
if there are going to be cases like this , then people will feel reluctant to call the police in case they are sued			2
‘ i do not think in such circumstances the public would feel they had a responsibility for health and safety issues , in the middle of the night while apparently facing danger			0
' it ’s a bizarre case and we need some urgent guidelines from the @entity109			0
’ @entity6 mp @entity143 added that any successful lawsuit would ‘ set an extraordinary precedent ’			0
he added : ‘ i think most people would regard it as quite bizarre that an officer acting in the course of their duties would pursue a claim against a member of the public who has legitimately called them out			2
' it is preposterous to imagine that it is appropriate ; it is the police doing the job they are employed to do			0
’ part two : in the letter , the petrol station owner is accused of exposing the policewoman ' to an unnecessary risk of injury ' his thoughts were , understandably , echoed by garage owner mr @entity36 , whose business had previously been targeted by a professional gang of thieves			1
he said : ‘ if an officer can now sue you because they ’ve tripped over on your property what does that mean for the average homeowner ? ‘ if you hear a burglar downstairs , do you have to nail down your stair carpet , close the windows and put the lights on before you dial 999 ? ' this is the health and safety culture at work , the fallacy that someone is to blame for any and every accident and that compensation is free			2
’ when @entity187 traced @entity28 to her semi-detached home in @entity5 , she declined to answer questions about the case			2
the mother of two appeared in good health , carrying bags of shopping from her 4x4 into her house and laughing and joking			0
injuries : @entity28 claims she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall ¿ although she was well enough to continue the search of the garage at the time trip : the kerb upon which @entity28 tripped in the station 's jet wash area			1
the lawyers claim ' there was little to draw this raised section to our client 's notice ' she took the legal action without the knowledge of her employers at @entity215 , who knew nothing about it until alerted by this paper on friday			1
the force declined to say if @entity28 had finished her shift on the night in question or if she had gone on sick leave and if so , whether she had returned to duty			2
implications : @entity106 , chairman of the powerful @entity107 , said : ' this civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police ' a spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity215 was unaware of this litigation and as it appears to be a private matter the officer has chosen to undertake , it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			1
’ the precise nature and extent of @entity1 ’s @entity36 ’s injuries are not known , although her claim states she went to @entity238 in @entity239 for treatment			1
it does not specify if the treatment is ongoing			0
@entity71 said the case was instigated by employees ’ body , the @entity246			0
spokesman @entity247 said : ‘ in response to a recent request from the @entity246 we are representing their woman police officer member @entity0			2
‘ the officer was attending a 999 call and she subsequently made certain allegations against the proprietors of a service station which have now been detailed to them in writing			2
' the basis of any future claim will be determined by a court and a judge , who will make an independent determination of culpability and the award of any damages based solely on the evidence supplied by both parties			0
’ @entity71 ’s website says compensation for a serious wrist injury can be as high as £ 30,500 , with payouts for more minor injuries approaching £ 3,000			0
compensation for a leg injury could reach £ 16,000 for a bad fracture , with a simple break being valued at £ 5,000			0
@entity278 , chairman of the @entity279 , told @entity187 last night : ‘ if officers get injured in an incident , it ’s going to be for a court to decide whether someone is at fault or not , whether it be a health and safety issue or otherwise			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity246 , the ' union ' for rank - and - file officers , said : ' the vast majority of police officers undertake their duties with public protection as their top priority , with the potential risk to themselves as a secondary consideration , if at all			2
' however , on occasion private prosecutions and civil claims are made by police officers – and they must be treated each on their own merits			0
' however , we share the public view that policing is a job that carries with it a reasonable amount of risk , at times much higher than that			0
' the @entity309 is funding this particular case and the decision making for this lies with them			0
we are unable to discuss the details of this case further			0
' private matter : she took the legal action without the knowledge of her employers at @entity215			1
they described it as a ' private matter '			0
