by @entity1 reporter published : 16:30 est , 29 august 2012 @entity3 : 16:30 est , 29 august 2012 aggressive , quick - tempered people are more than twice as likely to suffer a stroke , a study has shown			1
it found that having a ‘ type a personality ’ – indicated by behaviours including hostility , aggression , impatience and a quick temper – could raise the risk of stroke as much as smoking			1
@entity18 scientists compared 150 adults who had been admitted to a stroke unit with 300 randomly selected healthy people from the same area			1
personality increases stroke risk : being aggressive , quick - tempered or impatient can raise the risk of stroke as much as smoking the average age of the participants was 54			1
their levels of chronic stress were assessed by looking at symptoms such as anxiety and depression , general wellbeing and behaviour patterns			2
chronic stress is linked to a high risk of stroke , which kills around 67,000 @entity40 a year , and personality traits can have a big effect			1
biological risk factors , including diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol were assessed for the study , as well as lifestyle factors such as caffeine and alcohol intake , smoking , and if the participant had a partner and job			1
the study , published online in the @entity56 , @entity58 - surgery and @entity59 , showed that having a high score on the stress scale - indicative of a type a personality - more than doubled stroke risk			2
a history of smoking also increased the risk two-fold			0
those with aggressive , stress - prone personalities were found to be particularly at risk irrespective of other factors , including gender and an unhealthy lifestyle			2
risk of stroke was also almost four times higher among those who had experienced a major life event , such as a bereavement , in the previous year , compared with controls			0
dr @entity81 , a neurologist at @entity82 in @entity83 , said : ‘ patterns of behaviour can reflect the capacity to adapt to a stressful life			0
‘ we found individuals with high levels of competitiveness and aggression are , following adjustment , 2.2-fold more likely to suffer a stroke compared with controls			0
‘ we did not observe gender having a significant effect on these findings			0
’ he said stroke was one of the principal causes of death worldwide , adding : ‘ addressing the influence of psychophysical factors [ such as stress ] on stroke could constitute an additional thera - peutic line in the primary prevention of stroke in the at - risk population and , as such , warrants further investigation			0

personality traits can raise the risk of stroke
being aggressive , quick - tempered and impatient can increase the risk of stroke as much as smoking
