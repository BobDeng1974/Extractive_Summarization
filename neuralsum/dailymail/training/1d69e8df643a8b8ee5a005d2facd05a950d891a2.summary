by @entity0 the youngest person in @entity2 to survive a liver transplant has just celebrated her third birthday			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , was just five weeks old when she had the groundbreaking surgery			1
and now , during national transplant week , the toddler ’s parents have found an unusual way to commemorate the heart - wrenching 15 days that they waited for an organ			1
@entity5 , pictured left in 2011 shortly after being born , had a life - saving liver transplant at just five - weeks - old			1
she is pictured right playing in a garden ahead of her third birthday for the last two weeks , hundreds of green stars have been popping up all over the family ’s hometown of @entity6 in @entity7 , leaving residents bewildered			1
today , @entity5 ’s parents @entity22 , 50 , and @entity24 , 43 , lifted the lid on the mysterious appearances and urged local people to sign the organ donation register			1
mr @entity29 said : ' the colour represents the " i live i give " organisation which supports organ donation and the stars are symbolic of organ donors and their families			1
' a man in a green star suit went around sticking them on houses , businesses and the @entity6 model village to get people talking before the big reveal			2
' the interest has been surreal and people have been desperate to get the stars - despite not knowing what they were			0
happier times : @entity48 and @entity49 are pictured with their daughter @entity5 almost three years on from her liver transplant ' businesses and individuals have offered to pay for them and the desperation has been a real throwback to the 15 days we waited for @entity5 ’s liver transplant			1
' it ’s on a totally different scale but the fervour seems to be the same			0
' within days the stars had generated thousands of interested followers and many theories			0
' some people thought it was to do with the @entity67 and others thought it was to raise money for cancer , ' said mr @entity29			0
' other people just think the star man is a loony and they are the ones that are closest to the truth			0
' but despite the couple 's unusual methods for raising awareness , their message is a very serious one			0
their daughter was given just hours to live after being born with toxic levels of iron in her liver and endured an eight - hour operation with a 50/50 chance of survival			2
@entity5 was given just hours to live after being born with toxic levels of iron in her liver			2
she is pictured right wearing a t - shirt with the charity logo , ' i live , i give ' ' we used to go back to our room and be panic - stricken because we did n’t know whether the next day @entity5 would be dead or whether someone would say we have a liver , ' mr @entity29 added			1
' you go in the next day and the little child in the next bed is dead			0
you have life and death thrust at you in the most horrendous fashion			0
' three people die every day because there are n’t enough organs to go around			0
' @entity5 came within inches of death but from looking at her you would never know in a month of wednesdays			2
