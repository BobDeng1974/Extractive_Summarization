@entity1 's row with @entity2 escalated when @entity4 ’s head coach claimed @entity5 wanted to train on the day he picked up his thigh injury			1
@entity5 , who has been left out of @entity4 ’s squad for the @entity9 qualifiers against @entity10 and @entity11 , has not played since picking up the injury after @entity4 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity14			1
@entity2 claims the @entity16 forward is instructed not to train for 48 hours after a match , but @entity1 offered a very different version of events on thursday			1
@entity5 is still sidelined after getting injured on international duty @entity16 striker @entity5 is battling to overcome a thigh problem @entity4 ’s head coach said : ‘ the interesting thing for the session where @entity5 got injured is that he was quite keen to take part in that training session because he was such an important part of it and we were trying to develop a new system of play			1
‘ he was the forward who understood it best			0
he was more than happy to come in and help us to get our points over to the others			0
‘ it ’s doubly unfortunate that he got injured			0
no manager has as yet said to me that players must not train two days after a game			0
‘ but i understand that @entity5 is an important player and i understand @entity2 being unhappy that he is injured			1
@entity1 has escalated his war of words with @entity16 boss @entity2 ‘ you have to be careful saying injuries are preventable			1
we could have done a completely different training session or @entity5 could have done a recovery session which @entity2 might have thought was more suitable but i still could n’t guarantee there would n’t have been an injury			1
’ @entity1 insists he will not be dictated to by club managers over which players he can select for international duty , but @entity2 appears to have outmanoeuvred the @entity4 boss			2
@entity5 has yet to train with the first team at @entity16 as he recovers , but there is a chance he will be a substitute in saturday ’s game against @entity58			1
if @entity5 is included for the first time since the 3 - 0 victory at @entity62 on august 31 , it will come as a severe embarrassment to @entity1			2
@entity2 is trying to get @entity5 up to speed after four weeks out @entity2 said : ‘ i respect @entity1 has work to do but my thoughts are for the @entity16 players and what their needs are			1
‘ we agreed it was too soon for @entity5 to meet up irrespective of whether he is involved or not			2
he has not trained with the team at all so it was not the right time for him to go			0
‘ it was amicable , there is no issue			0
we will have to wait and see how he is			0
he ca n’t be ready to play for @entity4 if he is not ready to play for @entity16			0
‘ he has had a @entity79 injury now for near on four weeks which is a long time and my focus is now getting him to play for @entity16			2
@entity5 has n't played since @entity4 's friendly win against @entity14 last month ‘ once he is playing for @entity16 and showing that level of fitness , @entity1 will then look at him and get him into the squad			2
’ @entity1 also revealed on thursday that @entity5 has now taken on the role as an unofficial team leader with @entity4			0
‘ the one person who is unhappy is @entity5 because he would have loved to have been with us , ’ he added @entity4 have confirmed they will play an international friendly away to @entity91 in march .			0
