mr @entity2 warned the the situation in @entity6 was ' appalling and deteriorating '			0
but at a press conference after talks with mr @entity3 , he added : ' it 's no secret that we have had differing views on how best to handle the situation but we share fundamental aims : to end the conflict , to stop @entity6 fragmenting , to let the @entity6 people choose who governs them and to prevent the growth of violent extremism			0
' in a thinly - veiled plea to the @entity4 president , mr @entity2 said : ' we urgently have to do more for the sake of the people of @entity6 to break the vicious cycle that threatens to destroy @entity6 and that threatens to export violence and extremism around the world			1
' the @entity29 and @entity4 leaders are joined by head of the @entity68 @entity69 , right , aboard the helicopter as they survey the @entity72 venues mr @entity2 and mr @entity3 put aside the contentious subject of the @entity6 civil war for a helicopter tour of @entity72 venues @entity2 today met @entity4 's president @entity3 to discuss how to end the conflict in @entity6 the visit came as details emerged of @entity29 ’s arguments in favour of lifting the arms embargo			1
ahead of his visit mr @entity2 said the atrocities in @entity6 ‘ continue to mount ’ and growing evidence that the @entity88 regime has used chemical weapons			1
he told @entity90 : ‘ there is a growing body of limited but persuasive information showing that the regime has used , and continues to use , chemical weapons including sarin			2
the room for doubt about that continues to diminish			0
’ @entity99 , chairman of the @entity100 , is providing regular updates to the @entity102 on information that @entity29 forces and allies have gleaned			2
@entity4 has previously blocked international moves through the @entity107 security council to impose sanctions on @entity6			0
however , a leaked document has revealed the @entity29 @entity111 's arguments in favour of easing the @entity114 arms embargo when the sanctions expire at the end of the month			1
mr @entity2 flew in for talks at the @entity119 state residence in @entity11 in @entity4 mr @entity2 has warned of growing evidence that the @entity42 regime has used chemical weapons the @entity29 discussion paper sets out two options : lift the arms embargo against the @entity125 completely , or remove the words ‘ non-lethal ’ from a list of exemptions , clearing the way for weapons to be sent to the country			1
@entity133 , a member of the @entity107 panel examining allegations of war crimes in @entity6 , claimed at the weekend that the commission had indications that @entity6 rebel forces used sarin			0
but @entity141 stands by its assessment that chemical weapons use in @entity6 " is very likely to have been initiated by the regime " and says it has ‘ no evidence ’ of opposition use			2
talks between @entity148 secretary of state @entity149 and the @entity4 leadership this week resulted in plans to convene an international conference on @entity6 later this month			0

a @entity174 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity29 has taken no decision to arm the @entity6 opposition			0
however , there is likely to be a strong case for further amendments to the @entity114 sanctions regime - or lifting it altogether - if the situation remains as it is , or gets worse			0
‘ discussions are continuing in @entity184			0
we need to find ways to increase pressure on the regime to accept a political solution and ensure we have flexibility to react to the deteriorating situation on the ground			0
’ more than 70,000 people have died in the conflict since march 2011 , according to the @entity107			0
@entity29 and @entity4 security services have agreed to work together for the first time since the death of former @entity199 agent @entity198 seven years ago , @entity2 announced yesterday			2
the announcement came after @entity4 ’s macho president , @entity3 , took the prime minister on a helicopter ride high above the @entity72 city of @entity11			1
the stunt was part of an attempt to end years of frosty relations			0
after more than three hours of talks at mr @entity3 ’s @entity19 dacha , mr @entity2 agreed with him that there will be ‘ limited cooperation between our security forces ’ as @entity4 prepares to host the @entity212			2
