by @entity0 the surroundings of @entity2 – a five - bedroom house in the heart of @entity7 ’s @entity6 country – are steeped in history			1
the house is on the outskirts of the village of @entity12 , which is mentioned ( though called @entity13 ) in @entity6 ’s @entity14 and has been used as a location for one of the many television adaptations of the novel			1
also , local pub @entity20 was renamed the @entity21 by @entity6 and is where the beautiful and tragic @entity14 is first described			1
the @entity2 , located in @entity12 , @entity7 , sits in the old grounds of a manor house in which @entity25 ¿ s sixth wife , @entity24 , lived and died there are links to @entity29 royalty too			1
the @entity2 sits in the old grounds of a manor house in which @entity25 ’s sixth wife , @entity24 , lived			1
@entity24 – who , most would agree , was @entity25 ’s most fortunate spouse , outliving him – retired to the manor house and , when she died , it passed to @entity36 but , despite all this history , @entity37 itself , which is for sale at £ 1.5 million , is relatively new			1
it was built in 1984 – the time of @entity42 rather than @entity36 – but within the walled garden of what had been @entity36 ’s house			1
on a still day , with no sound but the buzzing of bees and cheerful birdsong , it is easy to imagine these figures from history wandering within the now ancient walls			2
and from every single window of @entity37 you can see either the spectacularly restored @entity57 garden or the rolling @entity7 countryside			1
‘ this is a home for garden - lovers , ’ says co-owner @entity59 , 53			1
his parents had lived in the house and he and his sister are reluctantly selling it after his father died last year			2
@entity7 dream : @entity59 has put the five - bedroom house on the market for £ 1.5million immaculate : manicured hedges feature large in the secluded gardens at @entity37 in @entity7 ‘ it needs a family living here , ’ says businessman @entity59 , who is based in @entity73 with his wife and two daughters			1
‘ my parents had just retired when they moved in , and they painstakingly restored the gardens over almost 30 years			0
’ vast , dark green and manicured yew hedges are planted within the stone walls , creating a number of separate and secluded gardens amid the three acres surrounding the house			0
within these , fresh scented box hedges are laid out in neat patterns , and stone urns hold further shrubs			0
‘ there are few flower beds – the focus was on low - maintenance flowering shrubs , ’ says @entity59			1
‘ although the garden took a long time to complete , it ’s not labour - intensive			1
’ royal connection : @entity24 lived in the manor house after the death of @entity25 , and @entity36 inherited it the three - storey house was built from local stone by architect @entity104			1
and while he designed it in the style of the @entity109 @entity108 , it has an @entity111 feel – and an intriguing - looking tower			2
there is a good - size fitted kitchen and breakfast room that leads straight through an archway into a vast , light conservatory			2
here , eight huge canvas curtains sway			0
‘ we commissioned them from ships ’ sails , ’ explains @entity59			0
‘ the room gets so warm and bright in summer that it needs some shade			0
’ this conservatory is large enough to hold a dining table as well as a sofa and chairs , and folding doors open into a huge formal drawing room			0
the colours throughout are muted greens , apricots and creams			0
a stunning large bedroom on the ground floor has doors into the garden and there is a charming bathroom with a corner bath			2
there is also a downstairs toilet , a wine cellar , a storage room , a huge bright garden room and a double garage			0
‘ there is n’t a master bedroom as such , ’ says @entity59 as we ascend to the first floor , where there are three further big bedrooms and two bathrooms			2
a wooden staircase leads up to the tower , which has 360 - degree views and would make a perfect study or playroom			2
nearby @entity160 has a mainline railway station with regular trains to @entity163			0
@entity164 , area director of @entity165 , @entity166 , says : ‘ the @entity2 is a true gem			1
it combines landmark architecture and presence with a magnificent site , and will appeal to buyers looking for prestige , comfort , peace and tranquillity			0
’ @entity59 says : ‘ i have such fond memories of this house			0
when my sister married , we had a marquee on the lawn , and of course many family easter egg hunts , huge @entity187 gatherings and my parents ’ annual drinks party			0
‘ i ’d love to think of another family enjoying themselves here as we did			0
