a western @entity1 couple with 12 sons is eagerly awaiting the arrival of their thirteenth child - and even though they 're sticking to their tradition of not finding out in advance whether they 're having a boy or girl , they revealed that they will be ' shocked ' if their streak is broken			1
@entity15 and @entity16 are expecting their new baby on may 9,the @entity19 reported , and even though they expect it will be another boy , they say they will happily welcome either into the family			1
' if we were to have a girl , i think we would go into shock , ' @entity16 said			1
' it would probably be disbelief			2
' i 've experienced all the boy stuff , ' he said			2
' as long as we are having all these children , it would be really neat to experience the other side			0
' the couple welcomed their twelfth son , @entity64 , to the world on august 4 , 2013			2
their eldest son @entity67 is now 22			0
' the stuff that goes on in this house is all - boy - roughhousing and wrestling , ' @entity15 added			1
' if there was a little girl in there , i assume it would be different			0
' perhaps surprisingly , @entity16 , after being the sole female in the family for more than two decades , said she would lean toward having one more boy			1
' a little girl would be neat to have in the house , but a little boy kind of takes the pressure off , ' she said			0
' we know what we are doing			0
why change things up ? ' full house : the couple already have 12 sons together ( pictured ) and are expecting their thirteenth child together in may bouncing baby boy : the couple welcomed their twelfth son @entity64 in august last year ' it 's all boy ' : the couple admitted that their home is currently filled with ' roughhousing and wrestling ' the @entity101 , who live @entity103 , which is north of @entity104 , consider themselves devout @entity105 and do n't believe in using birth control			1

' i love being pregnant , ' she said			0
' i 've spent half of my life being pregnant			0
it 's very neat and very special			0
' the couple say their growing family was n't planned but rather a happy accident			2
' when we had @entity67 , we were in college at the time , and we thought let 's have one more so @entity67 's not ten when he had a brother or sister , ' @entity15 told the @entity124 shortly after baby @entity64 's arrival last year			1
' and then little @entity126 came along , and the flood gates were kind of open			0
