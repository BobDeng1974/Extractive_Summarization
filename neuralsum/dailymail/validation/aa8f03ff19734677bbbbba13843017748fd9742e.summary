it ’s the hope that kills you			2
just ask @entity3 manager @entity2			1
there was a period at @entity6 when you envisaged nothing other than victory for the relegation - threatened home side			1
instead , they got nothing , just a 10th defeat in 11 matches			2
without a dramatic turnaround in fortunes @entity3 are heading back to the @entity17			1

click here to see more from @entity85 's match zone but @entity2 believes 12 points from their final eight games will be enough to see his side safe			2
he said : ‘ we ’re not in need of a miracle , but we need a miraculous run of form and i think we are capable of doing that			0
‘ we deserved more but we should have maximised that performance with at least a point or three			0
the players are disappointed because the performance was very good			0
we are showing everyone there ’s plenty of fight in us			0
there have been teams in slightly worse situations who have survived			0
’ much will depend on @entity3 ’s next two fixtures : they face @entity108 on saturday week before heading to @entity109 three days later			2
the pressure is mounting and @entity2 knows it			0
‘ what do we need from the games against @entity108 and @entity109 ? six points			0
there ’s no point in saying we need a point , we need wins			0
’ opposing managers @entity77 of @entity20 ( left ) and @entity2 of @entity3 ( right ) have a quick chat before kick - off on sunday the @entity20 players congratulate @entity24 ( right ) after his opener at @entity6 put @entity20 1 - 0 up at half - time @entity2 ’s mood was in stark contrast to @entity77 , who described this victory as his most satisfying since taking over in the summer of 2013			1
it has been a rough week for the @entity20 boss			2
the 5 - 2 @entity129 hammering against @entity130 on thursday added to the criticism levelled at him and graffiti on the walls of @entity135 calling for the @entity136 to be sacked did not help his mood			2
this win did , though			0
he said : ‘ this was n’t a day to be technical , this was a day to be strong as a group of players			0
‘ the graffiti ? we are a very passionate club			0
when you do n’t get the results you want , you will get unrest			0
as a manager i accept that but i focus on what i need to do to get a winning team			0
i always respect the views from the outside			0
’ the win , which puts @entity20 on the brink of safety , did come at a cost , however			2
forward ’s @entity65 and @entity67 will both be assessed this morning after sustaining respective knee and hamstring injuries			0
after a bright opening from the hosts , @entity20 took an 18th - minute lead against the run of play			1
it was a cracker , too , @entity24 stroking a right - footed angled shot from 16 yards past @entity168			1
the goal encapsulated @entity3 ’s season			1
@entity39 ( centre ) of @entity3 attempts to challenge @entity20 's @entity64 ( centre left ) with other players trying to get involved @entity3 strikers @entity175 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) attempt to score past on - coming @entity20 keeper @entity59 after going close to taking the lead through @entity40 , they were behind a minute later			1
but there comes a point when it stops being unlucky			0
@entity3 fans are starting to acknowledge that and their reaction to poor play from @entity48 in the first half was testament to that			1
@entity48 celebrates a possible goal for @entity20 but his strike was ruled out for offside as @entity3 searched for a valuable victory @entity20 left back @entity62 ( left ) shields the ball away from @entity192 during the @entity23 contest at @entity6 @entity3 captain @entity46 , having returned from a three match suspension , issues instructions to team - mate @entity39 @entity44 of @entity3 ( left ) and defender @entity41 ( right ) try to dispossess @entity20 striker @entity67 @entity2 ’s side mustered a reaction when substitute @entity31 equalised from close range in the 65th minute			1
@entity6 was rocking , home fans sensing what could be a season - defining three points			1
the optimism did not last long , however , as @entity20 secured the victory 12 minutes later through @entity18 ’s first goal for the club			1
