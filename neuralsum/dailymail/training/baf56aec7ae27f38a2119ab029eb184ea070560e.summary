defence secretary @entity0 warned some areas were ' swamped ' by migrants defence secretary @entity0 provoked a furious row yesterday after warning that communities were being ‘ swamped ’ by @entity6 immigrants			1
last night he was reprimanded by @entity7 for his use of the word and rival politicians lined up to criticise what they called his ‘ excessive language ’			2
@entity14 backbenchers , however , said it was appalling that a minister had been told to retract comments when all he had done was speak out frankly on immigration			2
during a tv interview , mr @entity0 said some towns were ‘ under siege ’ from ‘ huge numbers ’ of migrants and that action was needed to tackle free movement rules			1
he spoke of trying to ‘ prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers ’			1
he was responding to a question about @entity33 chancellor @entity32 ’s declaration that she would not back the @entity35 ’s bid to change the rules – a major blow to @entity38			1
but his use of the word ‘ swamped ’ in relation to immigration and asylum – which has long been toxic in @entity35 politics , provoked fierce criticism			2
even @entity46 ’s immigration spokesman branded his words ‘ excessive ’			2
last night a government source said mr @entity0 had admitted he had made a mistake , and should have used the less emotive term ‘ under pressure ’			1
@entity46 leader @entity52 said the fact mr @entity0 had used such language showed how ‘ panicked ’ the @entity55 were over their failure to control migration and the threat posed by his party at next month ’s @entity61 and @entity62 by - election			1
in an embarrassing mark of @entity67 disarray , another cabinet minister said @entity35 actually needed @entity69 migrants to fill unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector in the very same areas mr @entity0 was referring to			1
asked if she agreed that migrants were needed , environment secretary @entity73 told the @entity75 ’s @entity74 : ‘ i accept we do , yes			1
’ ‘ i ’m an mp in @entity77 , and there is an element of migrant work force , that ’s very true , ’ she said			2
@entity33 chancellor @entity32 , who is meant to be one of mr @entity38 ’s key supporters in the @entity69 reform drive , delivered a major blow when she said she would not support his demands for radical changes to the central @entity69 tenet of free movement of workers			1
the prime minister has promised that clawing back control over immigration will be a ‘ red line issue ’ in renegotiating @entity35 membership terms , ahead of a mooted in - out referendum if he is still in power in 2017			0
@entity38 had indicated migration reforms as key to mooted renegotiation of the @entity35 's membership terms @entity102 has made clear she is not open to renegotiation on the free movement of people across the @entity69 but mrs @entity32 told the @entity106 : ‘ @entity33 will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the @entity69			1
’ the row flared as mr @entity38 prepared to face mps today on the @entity69 ’s shock demand for an extra £ 1.7billion			1
politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word ‘ swamped ’ when talking about immigration			0
in 2002 , @entity117 refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were ‘ swamping ’ some @entity35 schools			0
the then @entity120 made his remarks while defending the @entity122			0
the @entity123 said they were ‘ hugely emotive ’			0
in 1978 , @entity124 said people feared being ‘ swamped ’ by immigration from the new @entity127 and @entity128			2
on the prospect of four million immigrants , she said : ‘ now , that is an awful lot and i think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture			2
’ speaking on the @entity138 programme on @entity139 , mr @entity0 said that despite mrs @entity32 ’s comments , all was not lost – because negotiations had not even started yet			1
‘ the @entity33 have n’t seen our proposal yet , and we have n’t seen our proposal yet , ’ he said			1
‘ that is still being worked on at the moment to see what we can do to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers			2
‘ in some areas , particularly on the east coast , yes , towns do feel under siege from large numbers of migrant workers and people claiming benefits			1
it is quite right that we look at that			0
’ politicians from all sides lined up to criticise his language			0
@entity168 energy secretary @entity167 said politicians needed to be responsible in the words they used when discussing the issue			2
@entity120 ’s @entity6 spokesman @entity171 told @entity173 ’s @entity172 : ‘ that ’s certainly not language i would use			0
’ @entity176 , @entity46 ’s immigration spokesman , said : ‘ can you imagine what would have been said if we had said that ? ’ later in the day , the government put out a statement saying : ‘ he accepts he should have chosen his words better			0
he should have said “ under pressure ”			0
’ but the slap - down attracted criticism from @entity14 backbenchers last night			0
@entity188 , mp for @entity189 , said : ‘ what the @entity192 praetorian guard around the prime minister have done shows how out of touch they are , and how in touch @entity0 is			1
‘ @entity124 used the word “ swamped ” , and she was in touch with public opinion			0
@entity0 was speaking up for millions up and down the country			1
’ @entity203 , mp for @entity204 , said : ‘ @entity7 and mr @entity0 are saying the same thing , but he is reflecting more the words you hear on the doorstep			1
’ @entity46 targets 100 seats @entity46 will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support , the party ’s biggest donor has revealed			0
businessman @entity216 said the @entity218 party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be ‘ seen from the @entity221 ’			0
mr @entity216 , who will give another £ 1.5 million to help step up the drive , said @entity46 will be raising ‘ significant further funds ’ as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified			0
@entity46 leader @entity52 is hopeful of winning 100 seats in the may general election , a donor revealed he told the @entity106 : ‘ @entity46 is not going to lose the campaign because we do n’t have enough adverts			0
’ research by @entity235 for the @entity236 yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote @entity46 if they thought it could win in their area			0
former home office minister @entity240 warned that it would be a ‘ complete disaster ’ if the @entity242 became ‘ @entity243 ’ , urging the @entity55 to ‘ calm down ’ .			0
