by @entity1 reporter published : 16:16 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 04:34 est , 3 october 2012 among the dozens of photos that proud parents @entity3 and @entity5 were taking of their newborn son , one in particular stood out			1
the striking image showed nine - week - old @entity8 lying on a play mat with a ghostly white reflection in his left eye			1
alarm bells immediately started ringing for mr @entity13 , a professional photographer and cameraman who had never seen anything like it before			0
@entity13 was discovered to have had a rare eye cancer which had caused a large tumour behind his eye after a trip to the gp , @entity8 was swiftly referred to a local children ’s hospital where a consultant delivered the devastating news that a rare eye cancer had caused a large tumour behind the eye – and five smaller ones behind his right eye			1
four months on , @entity8 is responding to chemotherapy and laser treatment			1
but his parents have decided to speak out about his case to warn other parents about the condition			2
‘ when we were told he had tumours it was heartbreaking and @entity5 was hysterical			2
' she was crying her eyes out , ’ said mr @entity13 , who is in his 30s and from @entity39 in @entity40			0
‘ we ’d never heard of this condition before			0
no one in our family had had it			0
‘ but he is responding well to treatment			2
@entity8 has been very good and the only problem is he wakes up a lot at night because chemotherapy makes babies feed little and often			1
’ mrs @entity5 , an adult social services manager , added : ‘ at first when we heard the news i would cry every day – away from @entity8 so he would n’t pick up on our unhappiness			1
now we take it one day at a time			0
’ the couple first spotted something was wrong at the end of may			0
‘ @entity8 is our first child so we were taking lots of photos with a camera phone , ’ said mr @entity13			1
‘ sometimes you get red eye in the photos but this looked almost like a hole in his eye			1
‘ we went to the gp who said the eye was n’t reflecting light and referred us to @entity70			2
’ within days , tests revealed the mass of tumours behind his eyes			2
the infant was diagnosed with retinoblastoma , a malignant tumour that starts in the retina , the light sensitive lining of the eye			1
the condition , which is inherited in around two in five cases , affects around 50 children in the @entity85 each year , generally under the age of five			0
if caught soon enough , the chances of being cured are around 95 per cent			0

he is very happy , jolly and playful			0

‘ he has continued to grow and thrive throughout his treatment and he looks fantastic now			0
