the future shape of @entity1 if @entity2 goes independent has been glimpsed in a piece of @entity5 chicken			1
the bizarre discovery was made by @entity7 when he pulled out a breaded piece of fillet and noticed it looked just like a map of @entity12 and @entity13 - but no @entity2			1
it comes hot on the heels of the appearance of a cloud in the shape of the @entity1 with @entity2 removed			1
the 55 - year - old from the @entity30 said : ' i picked this one piece out and i thought it looked like the map of @entity1 , but then i realised @entity2 was missing			1
' he added : ' i did n't notice it at first , but the closer i looked the more it just looked like the @entity1 - well , @entity12 and @entity13 - but with no @entity2			1
' i do n't know whether it 's an omen for the outcome of the @entity2 referendum , but i would n't be surprised if @entity2 vote yes			1
' earlier @entity41 , a @entity42 who lives in @entity12 , took a picture of a cloud which she says looks like a map of the @entity1 with @entity2 removed			1
she now believes the odd sighting could be an ' omen ' about thursday 's vote - though sceptics may dismiss it as nothing more than coincidence			1
' @entity52 ' : @entity53 took this photograph of a cloud which looks like the @entity1 without @entity2 mrs @entity41 , 44 , grew up in the village of @entity57 in @entity58 , on the west coast of @entity2 , but has lived in @entity60 for 20 years and so is not able to vote in the referendum			1
she captured the photograph of the distinctive cloud while on holiday with her family in @entity66			2
' i was on my sun lounger when i spotted it in the sky , ' she said			0
' i thought it was a bit weird			0
' the referendum is the talking point between everyone at the moment and i started to wonder whether it was an omen about how the vote is going to go			2
' mrs @entity41 added that she supports a no vote - but does not resent the fact that she is unable to cast a ballot			2
' i would vote no , ' she said			0
' i think @entity2 would be too small on its own			0
' a split would have a negative impact on the rest of @entity1 as well			0
i think it would cause a huge disadvantage to everyone , financially and politically			0
' close battle : the @entity89 and no campaigns headed by @entity91 and @entity92 are now neck - and - neck the engineer continue : ' i have been away so long now it has to be a decision made by residents , it 's not going to affect me directly			0
' most of my family still live in @entity2 so we discuss what is happening with them			0
' my daughters are 13 and 16 , but my oldest thinks that 16 is too young to vote and she feels like if she had a vote she would n't be ready to decide			0
' but my youngest is quite interested in it all and she says she would vote yes if she could			0
' whatever happens i think it 's going to have a big impact on the @entity1 as a whole			2
