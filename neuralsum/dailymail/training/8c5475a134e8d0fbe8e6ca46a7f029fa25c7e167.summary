by @entity0 no two people smell scents the same way , which explains why some people find certain aromas appealing and others find the same smell stomach - churning			1
@entity9 scientists have found that a difference at the smallest level of dna - one amino acid on one gene - can determine whether a person finds a given smell pleasant			1
they discovered there are almost a million variations on 400 smell receptors so that everyone smells things differently			1
psychologists from @entity21 found that bad body odour is commonly associated with vulnerability , which triggers feelings of concern			0
this , in turn , leads other people to pity the person with the odour and treat them more favourably than others researchers at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , said a different amino acid on the same gene in a friend 's body could mean they find the an odour offensive that you find pleasant			1
there are about 900,000 genetic variations on 400 smell receptors in our noses , according to the @entity48			1
these receptors control the sensors that determine how we smell odours , so a given scent will activate a suite of receptors in the nose , creating a specific signal for the brain			2
but @entity59 , associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the university ’s @entity62 , said the receptors work differently for all of us			0
‘ there are many cases when you say you like the way something smells and other people do n't			0
that 's very common , ’ he said			0
@entity59 ( pictured ) led a team of scientists who systematically explored the triggers for specific odour receptors in the nose			0
the researchers found that no two people apparently smell things the same way ‘ we found that individuals can be very different at the receptor levels , meaning that when we smell something , the receptors that are activated can be very different ( from one person to the next ) depending on your genome , ’ dr @entity59 said			1
he explained that when comparing the receptors in any two people , they should be about 30 per cent different , but this figure is conservative			0
while researchers have earlier identified the genes that encode for humans ' odour receptors , it has been a mystery how the receptors are activated			2
to determine what turns the receptors on and why certain smells appeal to different people , his team cloned more than 500 receptors each from 20 people that had slight variations of only one or two amino acids			1
they then systematically subjected the molecules to different smells to see how they worked			0
there are about 900,000 genetic variations on 400 smell receptors in our noses , according to the @entity48			1
these receptors control the sensors that determine how we smell odours , so a given scent will activate a suite of receptors in the nose , creating a specific signal for the brain by exposing each receptor to a very small concentration of 73 aromas , such as vanillin ( one of the chemical constituents of the aroma and taste of vanilla ) or guaiacol , ( an oily aromatic substance derived from wood creosote ) the group was able to identify 27 receptors that had a significant response to at least one odorant			2
this finding , published in the december issue of @entity145 , doubles the number of known odorant - activated receptors , bringing the number to 40			2
dr @entity59 said this research could have a big impact for fragrance , and food industries			0
‘ these manufacturers all want to know a rational way to produce new chemicals of interest , whether it 's a new perfume or new - flavored ingredient , and right now there 's no scientific basis for doing that , ’ he said			0
‘ to do that , we need to know which receptors are being activated by certain chemicals and the consequences of those activations in terms of how we feel and smell			2
