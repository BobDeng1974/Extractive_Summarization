by @entity0 parents as well as children have been struck by @entity4 fever , as a new @entity6 baby name poll sees @entity7 enter the list of most popular names for the first time			1
and it looks like @entity12 really does have the @entity13 , with the name leaping up 284 places since pop mogul @entity16 announced the name of his child back in february			1
inspired by the @entity21 animation , which has seen people all over the globe left with that song stuck in their heads , the poll by pregnancy and parenting website @entity19 revealed a 243 increase in babies named @entity7 since 2013			2
the @entity32 cometh : frozen character @entity7 , voiced by @entity34 , has inspired parents when naming their daughter ‘ whilst the film ’s popular heroine is called @entity39 , @entity7 offers a more unique name and is also a strong female role model ’ , says managing editor @entity42			1
‘ @entity7 is the ice queen but she sees the error of her ways and is shown to be a sensitive , but strong and confident character			2
just in the way the name @entity49 from @entity50 increased in popularity in 2013 , films are hugely influential			0
’ in fact , the name has proven so popular that children have been demanding it be bestowed on new siblings			0
however , while @entity7 , taking the 88th spot , and @entity12 , placing 118th , have a new - found popularity , parents are still choosing old favourites for their children , with @entity62 and @entity63 bagging the top spots for little girls and boys			1
heir on his chest : @entity16 out and about with his son @entity12 , who was named after @entity16 's father old - fashioned names are a firm favourite among parents , with @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 ranking high			1
unexpectedly , it looks like the gorgeous baby prince is serving as a deterrent when it comes to naming our children , with @entity86 moving down to number 19			2
this is the lowest it has listed since 2000 , suggesting parents are put off by the idea of being seen to copy the third in line to throne			0
names of power : the chubby - cheeked cherub may be third in line to the throne , but parents wo n't be naming their children after him down with the kids : @entity103 and @entity104 have remained popular names for boys however , other royal names are still a popular choice , with @entity104 placing third and @entity103 coming in 10th for boys			0
some 30,140 mums took part in the survey to see which 200 boys and girls names have proven most popular in the first half of 2014			0
however , @entity42 expects the list will continue to change as we hear the pitter - patter of tiny celebrity feet			0
films are a big influence too , with @entity122 – the real name of @entity124 – and @entity125 – @entity127 ’s title role in the recent biblical epic – placing 14th and 4th respectively			0
@entity62 isabella @entity130 ( dropped from # 1 ) @entity131 @entity132 ( up 4 places ) @entity134 @entity135 @entity136 ( new addition to top 10 ) @entity138 @entity139 @entity63 @entity140 @entity104 @entity125 ( up 5 places ) @entity142 @entity143 @entity144 @entity145 @entity146 @entity103 @entity148 inspiration : the characters played by @entity148 actors @entity122 ( @entity124 ) - and @entity127 - @entity125 - have inspired parents when naming their sons			1
