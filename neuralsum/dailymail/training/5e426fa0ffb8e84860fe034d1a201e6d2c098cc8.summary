by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 17:22 est , 12 november 2013 former @entity2 foreign secretary @entity1 has demanded that sir @entity3 by stripped of responsibility for deciding whether key documents can be published by the @entity6 @entity1 has demanded that cabinet secretary sir @entity3 be stripped of responsibility for deciding whether key documents can be published by the @entity6			1
the inquiry chairman sir @entity7 complained last week that his probe has stalled indefinitely because sir @entity3 is blocking the release of correspondence between @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 president @entity14			1
but @entity1 , who was a @entity2 foreign secretary in the late 70s , said sir @entity3 is not the right ‘ arbiter ’ of whether the papers are released since he also worked closely with mr @entity12 in the run up to war			1
in a letter to @entity21 yesterday , @entity1 wrote : ‘ sir @entity3 was principal private secretary to @entity12 in no 10 from 1999 - 2003 , the very time when the decisions to go to war were being taken			1
‘ i can not believe that now as cabinet secretary he can be the arbiter as to whether documents should be published between sir @entity7 and @entity12			1
‘ it is obvious that there are differences of opinion as sir @entity7 writes in his letter to you that it is “ regrettable that the @entity37 and the @entity38 have not reached ” an agreement			2
’ in a direct challenge to the prime minister , @entity1 urged mr @entity21 to assert his authority and hand the responsibility to lord chancellor @entity44 , who already has responsibility for deciding which government papers can be released under the 30 - year rule			0
‘ who is the government ? ’ he asks , ‘ you as prime minister ? the @entity52 ? surely not for the reasons i have given , the cabinet secretary ? ‘ i suggest you ask the lord chancellor to form a judgement on behalf of the government as to what papers can be released			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity6 involves a decision to declare war and from the moment it was established it was clear it would involve examination of international discussions between @entity65 prime ministers and @entity15 presidents			0
if there is a precedent it is the inquiry held during the @entity70 to examine the @entity71			0
’ in a letter to mr @entity21 last week , sir @entity7 revealed that he has asked for ‘ more than 130 records of conversations ’ between mr @entity13 , @entity12 and mr @entity14 to be declassified			2
the hold up has also involves whether to make public ‘ 25 notes from mr @entity12 to president @entity14 ’ and ‘ some 200 cabinet - level discussions ’			0
in his letter , sir @entity7 said : ‘ it is regrettable that the @entity37 and the @entity38 have not reached a final position on the disclosure of these more difficult categories of document			0
@entity1 pointed to the fact sir @entity3 was principal private secretary to @entity12 between 1999 - 2003 a @entity88 spokesman said : ‘ @entity89 and @entity37 agreed in the @entity90 that the cabinet secretary should be the final arbiter of declassification - that remains unchanged and has the prime minister and deputy prime minister ’s full support			1
‘ at the outset the government assured the inquiry of its full cooperation and it continues to do so			0
’ allies of sir @entity3 pointed out that mr @entity21 has asked the cabinet secretary to take a lead on the declassification of the documents ‘ and that remains his view ’			2
the prime minister has repeatedly relied on sir @entity3 - for instance on the no 10 probe of the plebgate allegations against former chief whip @entity112 - where mps think he should have given to the responsibility to others .			2

inquiry chairman sir @entity7 said last week that his probe has stalled indefinitely because sir @entity3 is blocking the release of correspondence
