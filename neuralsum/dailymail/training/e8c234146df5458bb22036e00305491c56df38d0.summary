look away @entity0 and @entity1 , unless you want flashbacks of a certain night in @entity4 , @entity5 , on october 11 , 2006			0
there in the euro 2008 qualifying match , a bobble at the @entity7 caused @entity11 defender @entity1 's back - pass to outwit goalkeeper @entity0 for an own goal in the 2 - 0 defeat			2
but @entity16 left - back @entity14 and goalkeeper @entity17 feel their pain after producing their own sorry and equally ridiculous version in the @entity22			1
he fails to do so , and fourth - top @entity16 suffer a shock defeat against strugglers @entity37 2 - 1			0
still , at least @entity14 and @entity17 did n't do it live on television and in front of 38,000 fans ... @entity1 passes the ball back towards @entity0 between the sticks in october 2006 in @entity5 @entity11 goalkeeper @entity0 swings his foot at the ball but a bobble causes it to bounce over the ball goes behind @entity0 and on its way to the goal after the nasty bobble @entity0 looks behind in horror as the ball makes its way towards the goal away from him @entity0 stares in disbelief at the uneven pitch after the desperately unlucky own goal by @entity1			1

@entity1 scored an own goal in 2006 through @entity57 's air - kick
a bobble *meant* the @entity11 goalkeeper missed the ball completely
@entity16 left - back @entity14 and goalkeeper @entity17 copy trick
a rough patch in front of the goal forces ball to bounce over @entity17 's foot
