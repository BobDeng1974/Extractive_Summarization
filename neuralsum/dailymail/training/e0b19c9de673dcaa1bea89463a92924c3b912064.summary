we all have our dreams - even the most famous and successful among us cling to lingering fantasies			2
@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are no exceptions			1
the prize - ring is the toughest work - place in sport but those notions can still be romantic			2
@entity3 the @entity11 admits that winning the world super-middleweight title , climbing into the top 10 in the world pound - for - pound rankings and making history by filling @entity16 for his record - breaking fight with @entity19 were all achievements beyond his wildest imagination when he first laced up the gloves			1
@entity3 knocks out @entity19 to win their super middleweight fight at @entity16 @entity3 celebrates his victory over @entity19 - but his dream is to end his career with a fight in @entity30 but one last ambition remains and @entity3 is fighting to make it reality with all the ferocity he musters inside the ropes			1
the dream is to climax his career by boxing in @entity30 , the fight capital of the world			0
as circumstances appeared to be conspiring against him , @entity3 went gunning for that right			1
it would have been more convenient – not to mention more enriching – for his promoter @entity43 to match him against stablemate @entity44 in another domestic dust - up			2
to that end he manoeuvred @entity44 into position as mandatory challenger for one of @entity3 ’s world titles			1
the @entity53 , to their discredit , have threatened to strip @entity3 of that title unless he boxes @entity44 next			1
never mind that he was worn their belt with distinction			0
nor that he has made two successive mandatory defences against @entity19 and morally merits a dispensation from their rules so he can make a voluntary defence or a contest a championship unification bout			0
to which @entity3 says : ‘ i will happily vacate this title in order to get a fight in @entity30			1
’ which is a polite way of telling @entity53 president @entity71 where to stick his belt unless his organisation – which has a history of corruption , racketeering and being monitored by federal investigators - cuts him some slack			2
as his promoter ’s biggest cash cow , @entity3 has also warned @entity43 that he will retire unless he books him a glamour night on that famous @entity30 in the @entity85 desert			1
@entity43 has duly responded by reopening talks with legendary @entity88 promoter @entity87 for @entity3 to put his other , @entity90 belt on the line against @entity92 in @entity30 early in the @entity93			1
contractually that is not an easy fight to make but @entity3 is not only grafting to make it happen … but deserves nothing less			1
@entity4 the @entity4 has risen from poverty in the @entity99 to become the only eight - division world champion			1
he is also an elected politician who fights as fearlessly for his deprived and under - privileged countrymen as he does in the ring			2
@entity4 plays basketball for his side @entity106 just a month before a title fight vs @entity108 @entity4 shoots on court on his dream debut it is possible he will become president of the @entity99 in due course – yet that lofty ambition has not been the fantasy for @entity4			1
despite being what some would call vertically challenged – at just 5ft 6in tall – he has nursed a long - cherished dream of playing professionally in the sport of bean - stalk giants			1
if only for a few precious moments			0
he made that come true on sunday , even though he is now less than a month away from defending his world welterweight title in a fight he must win if he is ever to meet @entity5 in the richest fight of all time			1
@entity4 , a hoops fanatic , bought into the @entity106 team in the @entity128			1
then he took over some of the coaching duties , while registering himself as a player			0
finally , with his usual propriety , he sought dispensation from his @entity135 boxing trainer @entity134 to take time out for sunday ’s game against @entity137			0
for just seven minutes , he became possibly the shortest pro in basketball history			2
never mind that he gave the ball away twice			0
@entity141 went on to win			0
and it was practice of sorts for his november 22 collision with undefeated @entity146 @entity108 , who is a good four inches the taller			0
@entity5 the man who calls himself @entity148 has come from the wrong side of the tracks in @entity88 to earning more than $ 50million a fight as the no 1 pound - for - pound boxer on @entity153			1
all the world titles have brought with them the cash to splash with such extravagance as dropping hundred dollar bills on to night club dancefloors in his adopted home city of @entity30 like so much confetti			0
that is just one of @entity5 ’s many crass displays of wealth			2
then there has been the jail time for assaulting the mother of three of his children , followed by a civil action filed against him by another girl friend for similar abuse			0
@entity5 ( left ) looks fully focused during his victory over @entity177 last month most recently he has been accused of staging and betting on fights to the finish in his gym , without breaks between rounds			1
that allegation of dangerous practice has been refuted once but re-opened by a law suit from two of the young boxers who claim to have been involved and damaged			0
and yet , and yet … behind all the bling and bravura what @entity5 really , really wants is to go down in history as one of the greatest boxers of all time			2
he craves that recognition as desperately as many desire true love			0
he makes that yearning public by wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the capital initial letter @entity203 … the @entity204			0
yet he knows in his heart this is not his distinction to bestow			0
he thinks he might earn it by being the richest prize - fighter ever and preserving his long unbeaten record			0
@entity5 ( front right ) , wearing a cap proclaiming him to be @entity213 but he is to be raised to that lofty pinnacle occupied by @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 then he has to do what they did – fight the best out there and take on the chin any defeat which may come his way			2
in @entity5 ’s case that means getting into the ring with @entity227 , his closest rival for that mythical pound - for - pound honour , before one of them retires			1
which brings us to one of the dreams which we mere mortal observers of the fight game and its heroes share			0
to see that fight happen .			0

@entity3 has achieved great things and wants to finish in @entity241
the @entity11 deserves nothing less
@entity4 has achieved his big ambition by playing pro basketball
@entity5 can be talked about as @entity248 - if he beats @entity4
