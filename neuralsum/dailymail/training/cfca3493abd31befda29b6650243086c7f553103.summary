by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is understood to be taking advice from a @entity4 lawyer with strong links to @entity6 to help him in his appeal against his four - month ban for biting			1
@entity9 is working with @entity1 and the @entity11 @entity10 with the ongoing appeal to @entity13 against the punishment , which also includes a nine - match international ban , after @entity1 ’s initial legal pleas , which included a denial that the bite took place , proved disastrous and only antagonised @entity13 ’s disciplinary commission			1
@entity6 are believed to have insisted that @entity1 make a public apology if he wants to move to the @entity24 club from @entity25 this summer – and the player obliged yesterday , admitting his guilt for the first time and apologising to @entity30 defender @entity29			1
back home : @entity1 with his son upon his return to @entity34 following his ban all smiles : this is what @entity1 would like if @entity6 managed to clinch his signature from @entity25 @entity41 's praise for sorry @entity1 now @entity42 , the same lawyer @entity6 have used to help them fight their transfer ban that was imposed by @entity13 after they were found guilty of infringing regulations in signing youth - team players from abroad , is also working on the case			1
the respected @entity4 lawyer is an expert on sports law and on @entity13 ’s procedures and his engagement and @entity1 ’s public apology indicates that the line of defence is likely to change from the ham - fisted attempt by the @entity56 to divert blame for the incident			2
@entity1 ’s defence is now likely to include an admission that he bit @entity29 , a display of contrition and a plea for mitigation			0
as such , it is likely that he will face a reduced ban and could be playing for @entity6 early next season , if his move from @entity25 is completed			0
shame : @entity1 received a nine - game international ban and four month suspension from football accident ? @entity1 previously told @entity13 he did not deliberately bite @entity29 but fell on top of him showing support : @entity34 fans wore masks of their star striker during the @entity80 defeat against @entity81 in his initial submission to the @entity83 , @entity1 was quoted as saying : ‘ in the run - up to the impact , my knees came together , i lost my balance and that destabilised my body and i fell into my opponent			2
' in that moment , my face came into collision with the player , causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth , which caused the referee to stop play			0
that is what happened and in no event did i , as is written in the document , ‘ bite ’ or ‘ try to bite			0
’ however , the attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous misjudgement by @entity1 and his legal team and resulted in a more severe sanction than might have been expected had any contrition been shown , as the @entity83 noted ‘ that at no point did the player show any contrition or repentance of any type , nor did he admit any violation of @entity13 regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having committed any offence			0
