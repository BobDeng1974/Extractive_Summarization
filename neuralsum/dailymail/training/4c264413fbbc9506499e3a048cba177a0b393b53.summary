by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 20 april 2012 caring : @entity1 was volunteering with an animal charity a charity worker whose family were told she died of a drug overdose in @entity6 was found to have no drugs in her system , it has emerged			1
@entity10 and @entity11 never accepted the official verdict from @entity6 that their sister @entity1 had died after an illegal drug binge			1
their worst fears were confirmed this week at her inquest at @entity19 when they were told that no illegal substances were found in her system after her death			2
but it was also revealed that she had 20 bruises on her body at the time of death , including one measuring 4.5cm on the back of her skull			1
@entity31 dr @entity30 was unable to give a cause of death and coroner dr @entity35 said the unexplained injuries ' were not investigated to any satisfactory level ' by the authorities in @entity6			2
@entity10 said @entity1 's body was flown back almost a month after she died , two weeks before her 35th birthday			1
@entity10 said : ' her body had to be identified using a fingerprint expert because it was so badly decomposed			0
' we were led to believe the cause of death was going to be a drug overdose because that is what the autopsy report we had been sent from @entity6 said			0
' we did not accept that at all			0
the moment we read the words " drug overdose " we said " no "			0
' if we had known two years ago that whatever investigation was done by the police in @entity53 would have been so rubbish we might have acted sooner			2
adventure : @entity1 at home in @entity19 before setting off for @entity6 ( right ) and once she was in @entity53 ( left ) ' we thought the @entity57 @entity56 would look after her			1
' mum - of - two @entity1 from @entity19 , who leaves behind son @entity58 , now 18 , and @entity59 , 13 , was on her second trip to @entity6 when she died			2
she was admitted to st @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity6 , in april , 2010 in a comatose state			0
the doctor who treated her had been told she had ' most probably ' had a drug overdose			0
he was unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at 7.20am			0
friends and family organised fund - raising events to pay for her body to be flown back to @entity19 from @entity6 where she had been volunteering for an animal charity			2
paradise : thousands of @entity57 people travel to @entity6 every year for the warm weather and beaches when it did arrive , a second post-mortem examination was carried out despite more than two - thirds of @entity1 's brain having been removed by @entity53 doctors			1
this week 's inquest heard how toxicology samples taken from @entity1 's body at the time of her death were only analysed 20 months later following pressure from the @entity86			1
dr @entity35 recorded an open verdict , saying : ' we now know she had not taken any drugs , alcohol or poison , flying in the face of the cause of death given in the autopsy report in @entity6			0
' that report , from the hospital where she died , said she died from pneumonia caused by a drug overdose			0
' dr @entity30 was unable to give a medical cause of death			0
he was concerned about the number of bruises @entity1 had on her body , in particular the bruise she had on the back of her head			1
' the whole thing is not particularly satisfactory for the family or anybody			0
' speaking after the inquest on tuesday @entity10 , 43 , said : ' after @entity1 died , friends who had seen her in @entity6 said she had been with this man called @entity119 on the night before she died			1
' we would jump at the chance to get out to @entity53 and see if we can find him and see if he has any information about what happened to our sister			2
' distressed : @entity11 , left , and @entity126 hold a picture of their sister , @entity1 , who was found dead in the @entity53 holiday hotspot of @entity6			1
