the @entity18 report was supposed to have been published last week , prior to thursday 's @entity58 over the @entity59 , but was delayed			1
@entity60 was embarrassingly forced to rely on @entity62 and @entity63 votes to face down a mass rebellion by his backbenchers over immigration			0
the report has highlighted the exploitation of ' free movement ' immigration rights given to @entity5 citizens , allowing them to move anywhere withing the @entity5 to work the prime minister appeared unable to control his party as 86 @entity73 voted to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the @entity77 to stay in @entity7			1
in a further blow , the @entity79 's attempts to pass legislation guaranteeing a referendum on @entity7 ’s @entity5 membership was killed off by @entity62 and the @entity63 in the @entity84 on friday			2
the government have been accused of attempting to conceal evidence by delaying the publication of the report , with some @entity79 mps saying it should have released so it could be discussed in parliament			1
instead the document is expected to be published this week as part of an @entity5 scrutiny select committee report - too late for it to it to be read by @entity89 debating the @entity96			2
according to the report , the principle ways migrants , both from @entity98 and elsewhere , abuse the free movement for workers right granted to @entity5 citzens is through sham and proxy marriages , benefit fraud and false documents			0

marriage registrations carried out by proxy , in which one or even both partners are represented by another person in their absence , are legal in some countries and in a study of 200 @entity5 residence card applications in october 2013 revealed 16 per cent of all marriage certificates put forward as supporting evidence had been from proxy marriages			0
immigration minister @entity144 said the dossier had been shown to mps on the @entity5 scrunity committee a criminal network which used proxy marriage certificates and fake or stolen id cards to try to get people into @entity7 illegally was also uncovered in a separate investigation			2

' it is clear that criminal gangs exploit the free movement rights of @entity5 citizens in order to facilitate significant fraud against the @entity7 benefits system , ' the report states			1
the report also says that 83 per cent of the 1,652 false papers seized at ports and airports by border officials in 2012 were either from the @entity5 or the @entity181 , made up of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 from the @entity185 and 27 member states of the @entity5			0
this had risen from 73 per cent of the 1,770 fraudulent documents seized in 2009			2

in a statement given to @entity206 he said : ' years of pressure from the @entity7 and other @entity208 that share our views has forced the @entity45 to finally acknowledge that free movement abuse is a genuine @entity5 problem			2
' this document was created as part of evidence provided to the @entity45 outlining these concerns			0
i have also shared this document with the @entity219 in both houses for further consideration			0
' the government is clear that @entity5 citizens who benefit from the right to free movement must adhere to the responsibilities this brings with it			0
