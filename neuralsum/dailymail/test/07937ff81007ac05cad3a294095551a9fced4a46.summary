the first people to be affected by @entity2 ’s newly enforced ' smart casual ' dress code have taken to social media to complain after being turned away from the airline ’s lounges for wearing thongs			1
@entity2 warned back in february that it would begin strictly enforcing its business class lounge dress code from april 1 - but not everyone got the memo			1
@entity11 wrote on @entity2 ’s @entity13 wall on thursday : ‘ thanks @entity2 club @entity14 for refusing me entry because i was wearing @entity17 ( i am going on holidays after all )			2
’ ms @entity19 fumed : ‘ i had just got off a long flight from @entity21 to @entity14 with a tired 15 year old and 3 year old and had to wait at @entity22 for 3 hours for our connecting flight to @entity25			0
i was told @entity2 have now started to " enforce " their @entity2 club lounge dress regulations which bans thongs			1
’ the mother said she never got an email to inform her about the new rules and managed to get into the @entity2 lounge in @entity21 on the same day while wearing thongs			1
$ 80 later , a pair of shoes i did n't need nor want and we finally are allowed to enter the lounge , ’ she said			2
‘ this is no way to treat a long term loyal club member who pays plenty of money per year to be a member			0
if you want to take hundreds of dollars of membership fees off us every year you could at least have sent members a letter or an email informing us of dress regulation changes			0
no wonder people are flying other airlines and joining other lounges			0
’ in february @entity75 , @entity2 ' @entity74 , told @entity76 : ' from april 2015 , customers entering domestic @entity78 and @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity14 and @entity21 will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply			1

' the dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs			2
' playing the role of bouncers , @entity2 staff are now allowed to use their ‘ discretion ' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines			1
’ @entity115 , bare feet , and rubber thongs ' in most cases ' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city lounges			2
@entity2 lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before @entity2 said they were ' sorry to disappoint ' when @entity123 was refused entry to a lounge @entity126 was also turned away from the @entity14 lounge and wrote on @entity13 ' i 'll definitely be thinking twice before renewing my membership this year ' @entity130 , who was also flying out of @entity14 on thursday , wrote on @entity13 : ‘ so i just tried to enter the @entity131 in @entity14 airport and was not allowed in because i was wearing thongs , jeans and t - shirt			1
‘ did n't realise any of it was offensive			0
although another lounge member walked in wearing shorts and sandals			0

’ she later wrote : ‘ @entity161 on my flight			0
i hate you sooo much @ @entity2 ’ and @entity123 wrote on @entity155 : ‘ @ @entity2 refused lounge entry despite full business attire except i like to wear thongs to fly			2

' if you have ever wanted to experience @entity2 business class you 'll have to dress the part men and women are encouraged to dress in smart casual attire if they want to get into the @entity2 lounges this is the first time the dress code – which has always existed – is actively enforced			1
