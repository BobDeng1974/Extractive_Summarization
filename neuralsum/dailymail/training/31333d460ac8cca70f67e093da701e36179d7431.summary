by @entity0 too raunchy ? @entity1 made his campaign video a parody of an erectile dysfunction ad and played off @entity7 's last name a @entity11 congressional candidate 's innuendo - filled ad has gotten him fired from his job as an adjunct professor at a @entity15 college			1
@entity16 is running to unseat @entity17 majority leader @entity7 in the upcoming midterm elections , and he made his minute - long ad a play on the @entity11 leader 's name			1
styled as an ad for a prescription for ' electile dysfunction ' , the video features smiling couples doing inane activities together with a voiceover warning about possible side effects			2
' if you have a @entity7 lasting longer than 23 years , seek immediate medical attention , ' the ad says			1
' other signs of electile dysfunction may include extreme skin discoloration , the inability to punch one 's self out of a wet paper bag , or maintain a spine in the face of liberal opposition			0
' by contrast , mr @entity44 sells himself as a solution to the problems facing @entity7 's constituents			2
' used on a daily basis , @entity16 in @entity50 will help you every time the moment is right , ' the voiceover says			0
' when using @entity16 , it 's important to know the borders will be secure , second amendment rights protected , @entity57 and planned parenthood will be defunded , and common sense will be used in solving the nation 's problems			0
' joke : the ad plays off the stereotypical ads which feature loving couples doing inane activities while a voiceover warns of the side effects of ' having a @entity7 that lasts longer than 23 years ' while the video , titled ' when the moment is right ' , has fans online - with more than 1,300 likes on @entity75 - not all @entity70 have found it to be funny			1
mr @entity77 has worked as an adjunct @entity79 professor at @entity80 for three years and his contract was not renewed as a result of the ad			1
the university spokesman specifically told @entity85 that the video ran in conflict to the baptist school 's values , but did not confirm why mr @entity44 's contract was not renewed			2
' ( at @entity80 ) we do n't get into politics ... we are all about @entity95 - centered education , ' spokesman @entity93 told @entity85			0
out : @entity44 had been working as an adjunct @entity79 professor at @entity80 ( pictured ) for three years but shortly after the video was released , his contract was not renued mr @entity44 said that he knew some people would be offended by the ad but purposefully thought about whether deeply religious viewers would take issue with the more @entity103 © implications , deciding in the end that it was acceptable			1
' we actually worked really hard to put something out that i could be comfortable with as a faithful person , ' mr @entity44 said to @entity85			0
' i knew it might upset some people , but we did the best we could to keep it as a parody			0

is styled as a parody of erectile dysfunction ads
