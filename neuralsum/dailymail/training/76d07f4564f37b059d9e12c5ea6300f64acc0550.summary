@entity0 insists a shouting match with @entity2 has eased the tension over his failed move from @entity5 to @entity6			1
@entity7 struck on deadline day when , at 10.55pm , @entity2 was forced to call the striker at @entity6 's training ground to tell him his move was off because a bid to sign @entity14 's @entity13 as a replacement had collapsed			1
having missed out on a two - and - a - half - year Â£ 5million contract at @entity6 , @entity0 has confirmed he tore into his manager on the phone , but subsequent talks have cooled the situation			1
@entity0 was livid when a deadline day move to @entity6 fell through at 10.55pm by a quirk of timing , @entity0 is likely to face @entity6 in the @entity26 fifth round , having made his first start since november 22 in the 0 - 0 draw at @entity29 on wednesday			1
the 31 - year - old , whose @entity5 deal expires in four months , said : ' @entity32 and @entity33 said to me it would be something else if i could score the winner at @entity6 for @entity5 given what went on in the transfer window			1
' i was upset at the time because i was n't playing here as much as i wanted to			2
' so when a team shows interest in you and offers you game time and it does n't come off you might react this way			0
@entity5 striker @entity0 had words with manager @entity2 but has now moved on ' the manager has talked to me since that and we have moved on from there			1
it was n't personal and these things happen in football			0
' i just have to get on with it and be professional and wait for my chance to come to start and it did against @entity29			0
' @entity0 added : ' i was over there and the deal did n't go through			2
' the gaffer kept faith in me obviously by starting me against @entity29 when i did n't expect it			0
i want to try to put a solid performance in			0
' he knows what he gets from me and that 's probably what @entity65 saw as well			0
' @entity5 striker @entity67 hobbles away from @entity29 on wednesday night @entity0 's prospects of starting at the @entity69 have been increased by the latest injury to @entity67			1
the striker had a scan on his left knee on thursday after being hurt in the draw at @entity29			2
having injured the same knee against @entity76 at the end of january			0
@entity2 fears @entity67 will be out for more than two weeks , but will not find out categorically until he receives the scan results on friday			0
