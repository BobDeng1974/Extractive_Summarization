' what would they use the minutes for ? the only answer which the court heard was the possibility of effecting legislative change , ' he wrote			2
' that proffered need is purely speculative and does not satisfy the requirements of the law			0
' @entity12 argued that the disclosure would damage the credibility of prosecutors seeking to assure both grand jurors and witnesses that details of their participation would be kept from public view			1

' this concern is particularly cogent in ' high publicity cases ' where the witnesses ' truthful and accurate testimony is vital , ' @entity31 wrote			2
' it is in such notorious cases that witnesses ' cooperation and honesty should be encouraged — not discouraged — for fear of disclosure			2
' the proponents claimed @entity12 was duplicitous for going to court to ask for a partial disclosure of details like the number of witnesses , only to turn around and argue against the release of more meaningful information like testimony and prosecutors ' instructions to the grand jury			1
