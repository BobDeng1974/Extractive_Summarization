by @entity0 a family have ‘ adopted ’ one of @entity4 ’s rarest creatures which has visited their garden every day for the last month - a black squirrel			1
the mutant rodent , which is a grey squirrel with a specific genetic defect , has been named @entity9 by the @entity10			1
husband and wife @entity11 and @entity13 live with their three children @entity16 , 27 , @entity17 , 25 , and @entity18 , 22 , in @entity19 , west @entity20			1
sooty the black squirrel seen in the garden of @entity13 and @entity10 in @entity19 , @entity20 creative technician @entity16 said : ' at first i thought it was a rat			1
but then i saw the big bushy tail			0
' i never knew you could get black squirrels			2
' he seems pretty happy though - he ’s back in our garden every day			0
' we put nuts and food out for him and his pals , and he seems very happy			0
sometimes he ’s with a pair of grey squirrels			0
the black squirrel mooches around the @entity38 ' family garden in @entity19 , west @entity20 you looking at me ? a rare black squirrel meets a grey companion in the garden ' he ’s a lovely little creature , and i hope he keeps coming back			1
he ’s like our pet			0
' black squirrels were first spotted in the wild in @entity48 , around 1912 , when a couple of the genetic mutants escaped after being brought over from @entity51			1
it is thought there are same number of black squirrels as there are red squirrels in the wild , mostly in south east @entity59			2
black squirrels originate from @entity51 and are the same species as grey squirrels			1
the only difference is they have a piece of @entity65 missing on a gene that produces pigment , meaning they can only produce black fur			0
the grey squirrel is a native of @entity51 but has become a well established invader in the @entity73			2
between 1876 and 1929 more than 100 grey squirrels were introduced to more than 30 different sites across @entity59 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
there are now more than two million grey squirrels in the @entity73 where they continue to spread and their numbers continue to rise			0
about a dozen black squirrels from @entity51 were released in @entity48 about a 100 years ago the black squirrel is the same species as the grey squirrel and they interbreed normally			1
scientists at @entity88 discovered that the difference between the black and grey squirrel is genetic ; black squirrels have a piece of @entity65 missing on a gene involved in producing pigment			1
black squirrels are commonly found in @entity51 particularly in the colder northern parts of the continent			2
about a dozen black squirrels from @entity51 were released in @entity95 , @entity48 about a 100 years ago , the first recorded sighting being in 1912			1
black squirrel numbers have risen steadily over the years and they have been a common sight in @entity48 , @entity99 and @entity100 for many decades now			0
although black squirrels are spreading they are not found anywhere else in the @entity73			2
the mutated gene has travelled about 50 miles in 100 years and so the gene is travelling at about half a mile a year .			0

the mutant rodent is a grey squirrel with a specific genetic defect
it has been named @entity9 by the @entity10 family from @entity19 , west @entity20
black squirrels were first spotted in @entity4 100 years ago
