' @entity0 exists to win trophies ' proclaimed the legendary @entity2 , and so far every manager at @entity4 in the last 50 years has followed the mantra and collected silverware – except the unpopular @entity7			1
to avoid remaining a second member of the very exclusive and unwanted club , @entity8 must beat @entity11 in the @entity12 on wednesday night , which will take his club into the semi-finals and within reaching distance of that elusive cup			1
for all his good work at @entity4 , @entity8 has not been able to show off something tangible on a lap of honour			0
even taking into account football 's fickle nature , the fall in his stock has been remarkable			0
@entity8 ( centre ) takes @entity0 to @entity11 for a @entity12 quarter - final on wednesday @entity27 and his @entity0 team - mates are enduring an awful season in the @entity30 @entity7 did not win a trophy in his short spell as @entity0 manager and was soon sacked less than eight months ago comparisons with @entity2 himself were being made as @entity8 took @entity0 within touching distance of their first league title for 24 years			1
but since then @entity41 has left , @entity40 been injured , @entity39 stopped scoring , @entity38 made errors and @entity27 slipped			0
to fill the gaps , @entity8 signed nine players at a cost of £ 117million , none of whom have been a success , particularly strikers @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity39 is another player suffering this season , and the forward has not scored for 21 games @entity55 's championship - topping @entity11 side lie in wait in the quarter - final at @entity58 there are unresolved contract issues over @entity39 , @entity27 , @entity61 and @entity62 and no words of encouragement for the manager from owner @entity66 just a few months after he handed the @entity67 a new long - term contract			1
@entity8 knows that more than at any other club @entity0 fans judge their managers by trophies			1
@entity2 got the ball rolling in a style that fulfilled his wish to ' make the people happy '			0
his successor @entity76 took domestic dominance into @entity78 and became the first manager to win the @entity80 three times			2
@entity82 then won three trophies in one season – something even @entity2 and @entity76 had n't managed			2
@entity2 started @entity0 's dominance of @entity88 football , and poses here with the @entity90 in 1974 @entity76 continued @entity2 's work , winning three @entity92 - this was his first in 1977 @entity82 managed to win the @entity80 , @entity94 and @entity12 in 1984 @entity95 won @entity0 's first league and @entity90 double as player - manger in 1986 @entity2 ( 1959 - 74 ) league championship 1964 , 1966 , 1973 @entity90 1965 , 1974 @entity100 1973 @entity76 ( 1974 - 83 ) @entity80 1977 , 1978 , 1981 @entity101 1976 , 1977 , 1979 , 1980 , 1982 , 1983 @entity12 1981 , 1982 1983 @entity100 1976 @entity82 ( 1983 - 85 ) @entity80 1984 league championship 1984 @entity12 1984 @entity95 ( 1985 - 91 ) @entity101 1986 , 1988 , 1990 @entity90 1986 , 1989 @entity103 ( 1991 - 94 ) @entity90 1992 @entity104 ( 1994 - 98 ) @entity12 1995 @entity105 ( 1998 - 2004 ) @entity90 2001 @entity12 2001 , 2003 @entity100 2001 @entity106 ( 2004 - 10 ) @entity80 2005 @entity90 2006 @entity7 ( 2010 - 11 ) none @entity95 ( 2011 - 12 ) @entity12 2012 @entity8 ( 2012 - ? ) none ... so far as player - manager , @entity95 then won the club 's first league and @entity90 double , in 1986			1
in recent times @entity0 have been surpassed by @entity112 as the country 's top team			0
but it has n't stopped their managers from collecting silverware altogether			0
@entity103 won the @entity90 in 1992 with a young @entity118 to the fore ; @entity104 ' side collected the 1995 @entity12 ; @entity105 delivered a cup treble in 2001 ; @entity106 unforgettably won the @entity80 in @entity122 ; and @entity95 won the @entity12 at @entity123 in his only full season in charge second time around			1
the one exception was @entity7 , sacked after six dismal months in january 2011			1
@entity8 is certainly regarded with far more respect than @entity7 and his achievements at the club are impressive			2
but it will mean little or nothing in @entity0 's illustrious history without a trophy to show for it			2
' i want a trophy this year , ' said @entity8 on the club 's pre-season tour of @entity138			2
with the @entity80 gone and @entity30 very , very unlikely , this is his best chance			1
it wo n't be easy of course			0
@entity11 are tipped to win promotion to the top - flight this season under their bright young manager @entity55 and have improved rapidly since january , when @entity0 won an @entity90 fourth round tie 2 - 0 at @entity58			1
but while @entity11 are better than at the start of 2014 , @entity0 's form suggests they are not			1
their two goalscorers that day are n't available now , with @entity150 at @entity151 and @entity40 out of action since august with a variety of muscular injuries			0
it is time for others to step up , @entity50 perhaps , or @entity39 , who has gone 21 games without a goal for club and country			0
' @entity0 are still the overwhelming favourites , ' said @entity11 skipper @entity161			2
@entity8 better hope they start playing like favourites			0
in its own way , this match is as important as the recent @entity166 and @entity112 games			0
the man who polishes cups at @entity4 is beginning to feel redundant			0
@entity169 ' @entity0 taking all the cups seriously ' - @entity8 @entity103 was not able to continue @entity0 's remarkable success , but still won the @entity90 in 1992 @entity104 may have underachieved as @entity0 boss but he lifted the @entity12 in 1995 @entity105 won a stunning cup treble in 2001 , including the @entity90 at the @entity173 @entity106 ( right ) was the mastermind behind @entity0 's unforgettable 2005 @entity80 triumph			1

@entity0 travel to @entity11 for @entity12 tie on wednesday
@entity12 represents serious chance for @entity8 to win trophy
@entity8 is under pressure *due* to slump in @entity30 form and early exit from @entity80
every @entity0 manager since @entity2 has won a trophy , except one
@entity7 was the exception - and he was sacked after six months
