by @entity1 reporter published : 17:04 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 14 december 2013 a @entity3 man was put on notice by the federal government last month over his business where he physically mints digital currency			1
@entity8 has spent years taking bitcoins - digital currency used in online transactions - and actually turning them into physical coins for online consumers			2
@entity8 's business model was simple : people would send him bitcoins over the @entity16 and he would send them back a physical , metal coin in the mail			2
bitcoins : @entity8 is suspending his bitcoin minting business after receiving a letter from the federal government to spend a bitcoin , you need a secret key - a compilation of numbers and letters			1
so when @entity8 mints his physical bitcoins , he hides the key behind a tamper - resistant strip			0
according to @entity8 , he 's minted the equivalent of roughly $ 82 million in bitcoins			0
that much business has put him on the federal government 's radar and now his business of turning digital currency into physical coins could be coming to an end			1
in november , @entity8 got a letter from the @entity41 , or @entity41 - an arm of the @entity43 that interprets the nation 's anti-money - laundering and financial crime regulations			0
@entity47 : @entity8 charges about $ 50 for each bitcoin he mints for clients throughout the world ' they considered my activity to be money transmitting , ' @entity8 tells @entity55			1
to legally transfer money , there are a lot of regulations that must be followed , and @entity8 has n't been following them			0
since receiving the letter , @entity8 has stopped minting his coins and no longer is taking orders for his popular @entity65 bitcoins			2
according to @entity8 , though , he does n't think he transmits money - he does n't accept any type of actual currency because he is paid in bitcoins			1
@entity69 : the @entity43 's financial crimes bureau is looking into @entity8 's business @entity8 charges about $ 50 per bitcoin but he 's paid in digital currency			1
the coins he sends through the mail , he argues , are not actual money and should be viewed as collectibles			0
the feds , however , see things differently , and rather than cross @entity69 even further , @entity8 says he plans to fulfill his final few orders and then calling his lawyer before he continues to produce physical versions of digital money .			0

@entity8 received a letter from the federal government telling him to stop minting bitcoins
@entity8 says he is n't *violating* any regulations because no actual currency is changing hands
@entity8 is paid about $ 50 for each coin that he makes for clients around the world
