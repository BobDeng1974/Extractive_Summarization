by @entity1 reporter published : 10:27 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 31 august 2013 @entity2 , pictured outside 10 @entity3 after winning @entity4 this year , could lose £ 500,000 due to a planning setback he ca n't seem to stop winning on the court , but @entity2 has suffered a blow off it after it emerged he is set to lose £ 500,000 because of botched investment plans in a new @entity11 golf course			1
the tennis star , who won @entity4 this summer and is currently competing in the @entity14 championships he triumphed at last year , invested the money for the planned course and spa at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity11			1
@entity20 would have been the 141st course in the county , where @entity2 lives with his girlfriend , @entity23 , but 10 days ago a high court judge quashed the planning permission granted to developers @entity26 , according to @entity28			1
the firm must now restore the course site to its original condition , unless it lodges a successful appeal			2
the cost , thought to be hundreds of thousands , will be added to legal costs and loss of income if the course is not built			2
despite the potential loss , @entity2 , who reached the third round of the @entity14 last night , is not short of cash			0
winning @entity4 added a cool £ 1.6million to his near - £ 30million career prize money , while the allure of working with @entity46 's first @entity45 champion since 1936 has proved too much for sponsors , which now include @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50			0
and last year it was revealed the @entity52 had invested in a rambling hotel in his native @entity54			0
another who could potentially lose out on the failed golf course project is advertising mogul sir @entity58 , who invested £ 250,000 , which planned to turn the home of the late press baron @entity60 , @entity18 near @entity19 , into a hotel and spa , with the golf course			1
@entity2 had wanted to turn @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity11 , into a golf club and spa but a judge quashed the planning permission the country house is near where @entity2 lives with girlfriend @entity23 , right , in @entity11 but another major loser will be the unique chalklands of the @entity72 , which some feel may never recover from the damage already done			1
@entity75 allowed the project last year against the advice of its planning officers and warnings from environmental experts			1
local campaigners challenged the decision in the @entity84 and won			0
mr @entity85 found the council ’s decision to grant planning permission on such an @entity89 was perverse , and that the council had ' erred in law '			1
the requirement to restore the site arises because @entity26 decided to carry on as if its planning permission were unassailable , and cleared meadows			1
environmental law specialist @entity96 , for the campaigners , obtained legal undertakings from @entity26 to undo any damage if it lost			0
' it is particularly gratifying having the court so explicitly recognising that what may be profitable for developers is not necessarily in the public interest , ' he said			0
@entity2 , in winning action at the @entity14 last night , has had little to scowl about on the court in the last year , winning @entity4 , last year 's @entity14 and the @entity108 longshot said it was ' amazed ' and ' appalled ' at the ruling			0
the judge denied leave to appeal , but the firm is expected to try anyway			2
professor @entity116 , a @entity117 of @entity119 member and a local resident , said there should have been no ' physical disturbance or spraying ' without ' scientific assessment ' of the site by skilled specialists			0
@entity126 , portfolio holder of planning at @entity75 , said : ' we will now need to take time to consider what our next steps will be			2
