poignant : @entity12 , former @entity28 president , once marked his name by a passage in @entity11 's @entity18 about facing death without fear resonance : the passage was marked by mr @entity12 while he was serving a life sentence for sabotage but the words perhaps carry greater poignancy now that the former @entity28 president has been gravely ill in hospital with a lung infection for more than a month			1

current @entity28 president @entity94 said after a visit to see mr @entity12 on wednesday : ' we are encouraged that @entity12 is responding to treatment and urge the public to continue providing support and showering him with love which gives him and the family strength			1

@entity108 from the @entity109 in @entity110 , said : ' @entity12 is aware of his own symbolic presence , and if we 're trying to fit that into a recognizable @entity116 archetype , it 's really the figure of the ` dead king , ' and we 're left wondering what will follow			0
