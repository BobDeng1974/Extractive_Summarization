@entity29 - 7 not one of his most taxing derbies as @entity1 kept playing the ball in front of him			2
@entity29 ( left ) competes for the ball with @entity36 of @entity1 at @entity3 @entity37 - 6.5 the natural deputy for the injured @entity39 , stuck to a difficult task of keeping tabs on @entity42			1
@entity43 - 7 solid and assured at the back in his battle with @entity47 , did n’t have the biggest contribution going forward			0
@entity49 - 7 generally neat and tidy but not the commanding display he produced against @entity52 last month			0
@entity43 ( left ) tries to block a cross from @entity1 forward @entity36 on saturday @entity55 ( replaced by @entity56 on 86 mins ) - 7.5 getting better with each game he plays , relished the physical combat of this game and his tackles had punch			1
@entity63 ( replaced by @entity64 on 60 mins ) - 6 one of the few @entity0 players to find any kind of rhythm , his pace always had @entity1 ’s defenders on alert			1

@entity75 - 6 had n’t kicked a ball since december 28 and it showed			0
clearly unfit , his inclusion was a gamble by @entity80			0
@entity81 ( right ) of @entity0 tries to hold off the challenge of @entity1 's @entity83 @entity84 - 5.5 a key cog in @entity80 ’s team last year , the former @entity86 man is struggling to have a similar impact this time around			1

@entity106 - 6.5 never gives confidence that he has control of the ball when in possession ; lucky to get away with hesitancy at times			0
@entity106 ( left ) tries to challenge @entity0 's @entity75 ( right ) and @entity71 @entity83 - 8 best defender on the pitch , won everything that game near him , whether it was on the floor or in the air			2
@entity118 - 7 has given @entity1 a good balance in defence ; might be a midfielder naturally but is blossoming in this role			2
@entity47 - 6 has established himself in the left wing - back role ; nothing spectacular from him but did his duties			0
@entity128 ( right ) and @entity1 's @entity118 both run towards the ball during the @entity17 derby @entity131 ( replaced by @entity132 on 16 mins ) - 5 missed the @entity133 win at @entity134 because of a thigh injury and the problem flared up again after 15 minutes			1
@entity137 - 7.5 kept things simple , got through the work that was required of him and tried to get his side on the front foot			0
@entity42 - 8.5 surprise inclusion in the team but took his chance and nearly did it spectacularly with a 25 - yard shot against the post			0
@entity1 youngster @entity42 ( second right ) smashes a shot against the post at @entity3 @entity14 - 6 wanted to write another fairytale in his final league derby but saw @entity71 block his big chance			1
@entity154 ( replaced by @entity155 on 56 mins ) - 6 a couple of sharp passes threatened to open the door but injury ended up curtailing his evening			0
@entity36 ( replaced by @entity161 on 82 mins ) - 6 his speed off the mark had @entity0 ’s defenders permanently on edge but he wasteful when he got a sight of goal			2
