by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor , @entity2 president @entity3 warned on monday that the @entity1 military 's missions in @entity6 , while limited , will remain an open - ended campaign at least until newly minted @entity6 prime minister @entity8 has established an ' inclusive government ' that can appeal to his nation 's warring religious and ethnic sects			1
asked if he worried about ' mission creep ' growing out of an offensive that has seen 68 airstrikes to date , @entity3 replied that he refuses to be pinned down to a timetable			1
' i do n't think ... at this point , that i 'm prepared to provide a blanket answer to that , ' he told reporters at the @entity21			1
' a lot of it depends on how effectively the @entity6 government comes together			2
' no timetable : @entity3 said monday that completing @entity1 's @entity27 mission would depend largely on the job @entity8 does in creating an ' inclusive government ' that inspires confidence among warring @entity6 religious groups and tribes @entity33 rose during airstrikes targeting @entity36 militants at the @entity37 in @entity6 on monday , after two days of @entity1 airstrikes allowed @entity6 and @entity40 forces to regain control of the strategic facility ' this is going to take time , ' @entity3 added			1
' there are going to be many challenges ahead			0
meanwhile , there should be no doubt that the @entity1 military is going to continue to carry out the limited missions i have authorized			0
' @entity52 said monday that it ' has conducted a total of 68 airstrikes in @entity6 ' since august 8 , when @entity3 first authorized them			1
a @entity57 official told @entity2 that the number would soon be elevated to a total of 72			1
that figure is small by the standards the @entity1 has established in previous @entity63 conflicts			0
at their peak in 2011 , @entity1 airstrikes in @entity65 reached a total of 5,411			0
still it indicates that the commander - in - chief is willing to bring a strategic hammer down on @entity36 , the terror group that claims it has established an @entity72 ' state ' across portions of sovereign @entity6 and @entity74			2
@entity52 said about half of its airstrikes to date came in the last few days as @entity6 military forces drove @entity36 away from the @entity37 , a key piece of infrastructure that could have been used as a tool of terror if it were intentionally breached			2
fifteen strikes near the dam , the @entity57 said , were carried out by drones			0
the sense of urgency @entity3 said he has communicated to @entity8 is driven in part by a desire to remove @entity1 armed forces from the @entity6 theatre			1
' i have been firm from the start that we are not reintroducing thousands of @entity1 troops back on the ground to engage in combat , ' he said monday			0
' @entity6 is going to have to ultimately provide for its own security			0
' leaving @entity1 armed servicemen and women in place to protect ethnic and religious minorities from a rampaging @entity36 is ' not sustainable , ' @entity3 insisted			2
' it 's not lasting			0
' the @entity37 is the largest such structure in @entity6 , making it a ticking time - bomb in the hands of @entity36 , but it was recaptured on monday caliphate : @entity36 has released its own redrawn map of the @entity63 showing regions of @entity74 and @entity6 it now claims to control @entity36 , an acronym for the @entity113 , has grown ' from a band of 2,000 thugs to a 30,000 + terrorist army , ' former @entity111 administration @entity57 deputy @entity110 said monday , ' equipped with state - of - the - art military equipment seized from @entity119 deserters			1
' the terror group ' now controls large swaths of @entity74 and @entity6 , has $ 2 billion in cash and assets , $ 3 million in daily revenue and controls oil fields and dams , which means it controls most of the water and electricity in @entity6 , ' she said			0
and its army ' is butchering , raping and beheading anyone who stands in its way			0
' @entity3 , however , remains focused on ensuring that @entity135 has an egalitarian government that caters equally to the complaints of @entity138 , shias and @entity140			1
' they ’ve got to get this done , ' he told reporters , ' because the wolf ’s at the door			0
and in order for them to be credible with the @entity6 people , they ’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible , united government			0
' ' we 've made significant progress on that front , but we 're not there yet , ' he conceded			1
not our boots on the ground : while @entity1 airstrikes have scattered @entity36 forces , @entity6 @entity40 @entity162 fighters ( pictured ) and @entity6 @entity119 regulars recaptured that dam on the @entity166 river not staying : an open - collared @entity3 insisted that he wo n't be dragged into a @entity168 - style @entity6 wa , insisting that ' we are not reintroducing thousands of @entity1 troops back on the ground to engage in combat ' @entity174 , the president said , will help ensure @entity1 's national security by ' making sure a savage group that seems willing to slaughter people for no rhyme or reason other than they have not kowtowed to them , that a group like that is contained , because ultimately it can cause a threat to us			1
' he seemed to be pinning his hope for a smooth exit from @entity6 on the belief that @entity138 , a minority group in @entity6 , will embrace a strong @entity8 government and stand up to the murderous @entity36 hordes that have overrun parts of the country that they had long controlled			1
with the success of a credible governing coalition , he said monday , ' there 's the prospect of @entity138 tribes who are the primary residents of areas that @entity113 now controls , saying , " we 've got a viable option "			2
' ' " and we would rather work with a central government that appears to understand our grievances and is prepared to meet them " , ' he suggested they might conclude , ' " rather than deal with individuals who do n't seem to have any values beyond death and destruction "			0
' appearing for his second press conference in a row without a necktie , a tired - looking @entity3 has taken a few days off from his @entity218 vacation to receive in - person briefings on the @entity6 crisis , and on the continuing civil unrest in @entity222 , @entity223 .			2

asked about a timetable , @entity3 said ' i do n't think ... at this point , that i 'm prepared to provide a blanket answer '
@entity57 said monday that @entity1 forces have conducted 68 airstrikes in @entity6 since august 8 but sources tell @entity2 the number stands at 72
@entity3 *emphasized* an ' *international* coalition ' aimed at supporting an ' inclusive government '
catering to @entity138 along with @entity238 and @entity140 , he said , will give @entity138 tribesmen a reason to turn their backs on @entity36 terrorists
' we 've made significant progress on that front , but we 're not there yet '
