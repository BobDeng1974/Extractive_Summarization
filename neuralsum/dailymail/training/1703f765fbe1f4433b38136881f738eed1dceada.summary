by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 12 september 2013 as they pull at a wonky bike stand in the small hours of the morning outside a kebab shop , many would automatically presume that this group of lads were drunkenly vandalising their town centre			1
but far from being a bunch of thoughtless thugs , these revellers were actually public - spirited good samaritans who were repairing a damaged rack			1
the high - spirited group were caught on @entity14 repairing a broken bike rack after a night out - using a team effort to heave the stand back into place			1
footage shows the group putting down their take aways and planning a repair strategy , before using their muscles to unbend the thick metal hoop which had been damaged when a car reversed into it			1
the group can be seen discussing their tactics before spending almost 13 minutes straightening the metal hook at 3am			1
the group can be seen gesturing to each other before nodding at each other and three of them grabbing the rack , as they try to pull it back to move it back into place			1
at one point one ends up underneath the rack , using his feet to push himself back			1
when that fails , they rope in two others , who then sit on the other side and push to help the trio who pull with all their might			1
after repairing it , they can be seen high - fiving each other and been giving the thumbs - up by a crowd who has watched their efforts			2
the group discuss their strategy and recruit two other helpers to fix the dented rack , which a car had reversed into the group can be seen shouting encouragement at each other as they end their night with a charitable act the group spent the best part of 15 minutes pushing and pulling the dented rack - and have been praised as ' public spirited ' that deserves another kebab ! pleased with their hard work , the group are congratulated by an admiring crowd the damage had been reported to the council but the young men stepped in before it was repaired			1
friends @entity94 , 24 , and @entity95 , 23 who were joined by pals @entity97 and @entity99 , both 23 , have since become internet sensations			2
@entity101 , who lives in the town , said : ' we saw the bike rack and thought it was a bit knackered and it 's been broken for a while			1
' we are both cyclists and had noticed it had n't been fixed for a few weeks , we were a bit inebriated , so decided to mend it			2
' we started pulling it this way and went " this is n't happening " , so we tried various ways and put our legs into it			1
' the feedback we have had has been ridiculous			2
@entity119 people have sent us messages saying well done			2
its come as a bit of a shock			2
' we did it at the end of a night out , we had all probably had too much to drink and thought it would be a good idea and did n't think anymore of it afterwards			2
' there was a big cheer at the end			2
@entity95 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) pictured by the bike rack after they bent it back into shape on a night out the group said it was a spur of the moment decision after they had enjoyed a couple of drinks to fix the busted bike rack @entity95 and @entity101 have already been congratulated by mayor cllr @entity143 and @entity14 and community safety portfolio holder @entity143 @entity144 ' we did n't know what the police would think if they saw it			1
they are more used to people vandalising and breaking stuff			0
' most people do n't go out with an intention of breaking something or being a nuisance - but there are a lot of nice people in the town			0
' @entity95 , a chef , added : ' we do feel quite proud of ourselves			0
i think we did a good job			0
everybody is very happy about it			0
' people have been saying ' good on you ' and that it 's nice to see lads not just destroying the place and doing good for once			0
' people were cheering us on saying go that way or this way and we all high - fived and hugged at the end			0
' its not the first time we 've helped out , we sometimes help drunk people get into taxis			0
' we like to do our bit here and there			0
' people keep sending it to us on @entity184 and sending videos , the response has been overwhelming			0
' @entity186 said it was surprised by their actions and called it ' public spirited '			1
councillor @entity144 , from @entity186 , said he had found it ' remarkable ' as he watched the men on the @entity14 footage			1
' young people often get a bad press and this shows there are some who want to contribute to their society and do the right thing , ' he said			0
' it shows young people acting in a very positive and constructive manner and shows they have a good and responsible attitude to what 's happening in their town			0
' their actions were very public spirited and impressive			1
' @entity207 , @entity186 's safety officer , said : ' we recorded the whole sequence			0
at first two lads had a go and then encouraged others to help			0
' at one point five were pushing and pulling			0
to look at the bike rack now you would hardly know it had been damaged			1
' the night - time economy is not all about bad lads doing bad things			0
