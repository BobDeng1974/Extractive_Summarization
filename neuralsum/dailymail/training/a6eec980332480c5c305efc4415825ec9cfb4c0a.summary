by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 06:07 est , 8 june 2012 an image of a middle - aged cross-dresser is the first painting of its kind to be hung in the revered @entity5			1
painted in 1792 by @entity7 it depicts @entity8 , an eighteenth - century diplomat and celebrated @entity10 transvestite			1
@entity12 born @entity11 lived in @entity13 from 1762 - 1777 as a man , and from 1785 - 1810 as a woman			0
' the patron saint of transvestites ' : painted in 1792 , the portrait depicts @entity10 ¿ s first celebrated male cross-dresser , @entity19 during both periods , he enjoyed considerable fame in international politics , high society and popular culture			1
no transvestite or transsexual , until the late twentieth century has enjoyed such public recognition , acceptance and popular affection			2
the portrait is seen as an unprecedented historic document of his identity and acceptance into @entity10 society at a time when men who were caught wearing women ’s clothing were viciously persecuted			2
acquired by the gallery for £ 38,000 the painting went on show for the first time yesterday following its discovery by art historian @entity45			1
at a sale @entity46 attended in @entity48 the painting was mistakenly labelled as a portrait of an unknown woman by @entity52 , most famous for painting @entity53 on the dollar bill			1
having brought it back to the @entity10 it was only when he set about cleaning it that @entity46 's suspicions about the sex of the subject were aroused			0
historic : the purchase of @entity19 's portrait marks an historic moment for the @entity5 he noticed stubble on the woman 's face and a muscularity , suggesting an unexplained masculinity			1
speaking to @entity72 said : ' cleaning is always a revelation and on this occasion it revealed that not only was it in lovely condition but more pertinently , the @entity52 signature cleaned off revealing the name @entity7			0
' further investigation by @entity46 resulted in the identification of the sitter as @entity19 , often referred to as ' the patron saint of transvestites '			1
although there are photographs in the gallery 's collection of @entity88 and @entity89 they are not dressed as women , meaning @entity19 's portrait is the first painting of a cross-dresser to hang on the prestigious walls			1
dr @entity96 , curator of @entity97 , at the @entity5 , says : ‘ @entity8 was a figure of international fame and notoriety in the eighteenth century , for his military , diplomatic and social exploits			2
' but it is his courage in following his gender orientation in the face of the severest penalties that make this portrait one of the most inspiring and fascinating images ’			0
long before @entity8 lived publicly as a woman he was feted as a soldier , champion fencer and diplomat who helped negotiate the @entity114 in 1763 , which ended the @entity116			0
notorious : @entity19 enjoyed considerable fame as @entity10 's first celebrated cross-dresser having made @entity120 his home , he refused to return to @entity12 when recalled , blackmailing the @entity12 crown with threats to sell secrets to the @entity10			1
surprisingly @entity13 society accepted @entity19 as woman and he became well known for fencing demonstrations in theatres dressed in full drag			1
despite his commitment @entity19 was not the most feminine tranvestite			2
as well as a noticeable six o'clock shadow he hitched his skirt when climbing the stairs and remained quite coarse and boorish			0
but this did n't stop pioneering feminists , such as @entity136 and @entity137 , championing @entity19 as a shining example of female fortitude			2
interest in @entity141 has never waned with a new biography appearing approximately every 20 years between the 1830s and the 1950s			0
in 1928 , @entity144 coined the term ‘ @entity146 ’ to describe transvestism and this remained in use until the 1960s			0
in the last 30 years , with the development of the academic discipline of @entity153 research into @entity154 has never been more energetic			0
the @entity155 ( which is named after the @entity156 ) was formed in 1966 to offer advice to the transgendered community			0
today it is the largest and longest - established group to give support of this kind .			0
