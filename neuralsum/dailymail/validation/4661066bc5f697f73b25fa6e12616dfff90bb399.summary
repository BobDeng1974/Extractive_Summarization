men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women the length of time that a woman can expect to live in good health is getting shorter , according to an official analysis			1
men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women			1
however , women still live longer than men overall – though the gap is closing			1
the statistics , released yesterday , showed that over the past three years the expectancy of life in good health for a baby girl in @entity17 has dropped by nearly four months			1
but during the same period , the length of time that newborn baby boys can expect to live in good health has risen slightly			1
the latest figures are gathered from the @entity21 run by the @entity22 , which collects data on 320,000 people every year			2
health life expectancy is calculated from the number of people who say they are in good or in very good health			2
experts say these changes are as partially as a result of the major economic , industrial and family upheavals of the past 50 years			2
men are likely to live longer now because few work in dangerous industrial jobs like coal mining , and fewer drink heavily or smoke			1
women , however , are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs , as well as bringing up children			1
according to the @entity22 , in the three years between 2011 and 2013 , a baby girl born in @entity17 could on average expect to live in good health for 63.9 years			1
this compares with 64.2 years between 2009 and 2011			0
in contrast , a boy could expect good health for 63.3 years if born between 2011 and 2013 , compared with 63.2 years from 2009 to 2011			2
this means that men now spend 80 per cent of their lives in good health , compared to 77 per cent for women			1
overall life expectancy for women is 83.1 years , and men 79.4			2
however , the figures also show a major divide between north and south			0
women are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs , as well as bringing up children , according to the @entity22 newborn boys in the @entity60 are likely to get 6.3 years longer in good health than those in the @entity62 , and girls in the @entity60 an extra 6.6 years			1
but women in the south are losing ground in terms of health expectancy much faster than those in the north , as health improves in the area			0
commenting on the results , the @entity22 said : ‘ the health status and mortality rates of a population change year on year due to exposure to different risks and treatments affecting health , and also through inward and outward migration			0
’ high levels of fitness in middle age can help men survive cancer , a study has found			0
researchers discovered that of those who developed lung , bowel or prostate cancer , keeping fit cut the chances of them dying from their disease by a third			0
almost 14,000 @entity96 men had their cardiorespiratory fitness monitored using treadmill tests for nearly seven years from the age of 65			0
for the men who developed cancer , a high fitness level was associated with a 32 per cent reduced risk of death			0
mid-life fitness also lowered the risk of being diagnosed with lung and bowel cancer , but apparently not prostate cancer			0
the researchers , from the @entity109 , told the journal @entity112 that future studies were required to look at fitness and cancer in women .			0

men are now likely to live a longer portion of their lives in good health
women still live longer but the gap between the sexes is starting to close
@entity21 says changes follow upheaval over last 50 years
women more likely to spend their lives in demanding jobs and raising kids
