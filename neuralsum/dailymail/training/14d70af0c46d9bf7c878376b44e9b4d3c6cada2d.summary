not many people have narrowly escaped death by as thin a margin as this @entity4 motorist who was almost crushed to death by a massive boulder crashing down onto the road just a few yards away from him			1
this extraordinary video , recorded by chance on a camera mounted on the dashboard of a second car following behind , shows just how lucky the first driver was			1
the boulder , weighing hundreds of tonnes and as almost as big as a house , rolled down the hillside near @entity19 in a landslide triggered by heavy rain			1
floodwaters rose to a depth of 10 feet and the storm also disrupted air and rail traffic , as well as forcing offices and schools to shut			0
several landslides have been recorded during the spate of wild weather , but this is the most dramatic to have been captured on camera			0
rocks began moving at the top of the hillside as the wet earth made them unstable			0
the drivers below were apparently unaware of the danger - until the huge boulder smashed down onto the road causing a bomb - like explosion of mud and rock			1
unaware : the white car moments before the death - defying accident explosion : a wave of dirt is thrown over the road after the earth - shattering impact the front of the car is battered by soil and rocks and the driver slams on his brakes the debris smashes into the car , pushing it to the side in the video , posted on @entity81			1
it shows the lucky motorist slamming on his brakes and having the presence of mind to switch on his hazard warning lights as the boulder rocked to a standstill beside his car			2
it even teeters alarmingly over the vehicle before finally coming to a standstill			0
he remains in the vehicle for a few moments , then steps out to stare at the boulder which had come so close to claiming his life			2
amazingly , no one was injured			0
on the edge : although the boulder had stopped moving , it still teetered alarmingly over the vehicle before finally coming to standstill @entity4 has been lashed by heavy rainstorms this week in another incident , 19 people were injured when a train was derailed in the bad weather			1
the six - carriage train , carrying around 250 passengers , hit the mudslides as it was approaching a tunnel in @entity115 , the @entity110 said			0
in 2009 at least 63 @entity4 villagers were buried alive by mudslides triggered by typhoon morakot which ravaged the country .			2
