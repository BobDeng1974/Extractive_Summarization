@entity0 will put his body through hell as he plans one final assault on a world title after deciding to move back down to light heavyweight			1
the @entity6 will return to the division that saw him reign as world champion for three years after his defeat to bitter rival @entity10 last november			1
@entity0 will be back in the ring on april 11 in @entity13 before targeting a shot at @entity16 regular champion @entity15			1
@entity0 will return to light heavyweight following his defeat to @entity10 last november ' it was very soon after the fight that i made the decision to move back down , ' he told @entity23			1
' it was obvious to me from the fight ; in the last six rounds i felt sluggish and just sapped of energy			1
' it was definitely the weight that was slowing me down			0
' it was a calculated gamble moving up to cruiserweight and i 'm not quite big enough for the division so the only option is to move back down to light heavyweight and hopefully get back to my best			1
' @entity0 said he felt sluggish in the second half of the fight as @entity10 won by split decision @entity0 , who lost his @entity36 crown to @entity37 in 2013 before winning his first two fights at cruiserweight , insisted he gave only the briefest of thoughts to retiring			1
' in the aftermath of fights , you sometimes have a few moments when you reflect on whether you 've got it anymore , ' he said			0
' but then you go away and have some time out of boxing and find your true self			0
i 'm a fighter and i love the buzz of boxing			0
' it gives me ambition and passion and i just ca n't let it go ; i need to get that world title back in my life			2
' @entity0 ( left ) said he only considered retiring for the briefest of moments after the fight but @entity0 admitted the process of stripping away the 25lb he had added to his frame will be far from simple			2
' in an ideal world there would be a weight between light heavyweight and cruiserweight but there 's not , ' he added			1
' it 's going to be very difficult			0
i 'm a little bit bigger now and i 've got to strip away a bit of muscle			0
' my body fat has got to be exceptionally low and my diet has got to change			0
it 's got to be specific to losing weight while maintaining high energy levels			2
@entity0 is ready for tough challenge of losing the extra weight gained when he moved up a division ' it 's going to be very , very tough and i 'm under no illusions but it 's something all top fighters have to deal with			2
' @entity0 will bring in a nutritionist but plans to remain under the tutelage of trainer @entity87			2
and after his tune - up in @entity13 , he wants a shot at @entity15 , who he was scheduled to fight in 2010 before the @entity90 pulled out			1
@entity0 has his sights set on a fight against @entity16 regular champion @entity15 after the april 11 bout ' @entity15 is the target , ' @entity0 said			1
' the promoters have talked and it looks like we can make it happen			0
' we 've got a lot of history and hopefully we can get the fight on			0
' you could say it 's my last chance because if i ca n't grab a world title now , then where do i go ? ' this is my last chance and i wo n't waste it			0
