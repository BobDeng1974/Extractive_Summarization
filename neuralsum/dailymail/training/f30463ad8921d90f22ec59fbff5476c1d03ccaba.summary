@entity0 and @entity1 yesterday staged a 35 - minute ‘ treadmill summit ’ side by side at a @entity5 gathering dominated by the @entity7 crisis			1
their crunch talks came as a group of influential conservative mps with close links to the prime minister and chancellor @entity14 unveiled dramatic emergency proposals to be taken in the event of ‘ @entity17 ’ – the increasingly likely prospect of a currency meltdown			1
the ideas include £ 7 billion cuts in welfare benefits and rejecting @entity23 moves to improve workers ’ rights			1
divided we fall : from left , @entity29 's @entity28 , @entity0 , @entity30 , @entity1 , @entity31 and @entity33 's @entity32 the plan was revealed after the @entity36 president summoned the prime minister for their workout at @entity41 ’s @entity40 to agree how to bounce @entity42 ’s @entity30 into taking action to prop up the single currency			1
mr @entity1 picked up mr @entity0 from the compound ’s @entity45 where he was staying for a morning run at 7.15am			1
they walked to the gym together , ran on treadmills and then returned at 7.50am			1
no 10 officials refused to say which of the leaders ran faster and hinted that the workout was relatively gentle			1
‘ it was the kind of workout where you can still have a substantive conversation			1
’ a senior aide said : ‘ they spoke the night before but they wanted to have a further conversation			2
some might argue this is not the right forum for talking about @entity66 issues but , as the prime minister has said , it is appropriate for the @entity5 to talk about these issues			1
’ after leaving the treadmill , mr @entity0 said there was ‘ a growing sense of urgency ’ over the deteriorating political and financial situation in @entity73 , which risks spreading to other vulnerable @entity23 countries and damaging the @entity76 economy			2
‘ action needs to be taken , contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks , governance , firewalls – all of those things need to take place very fast , ’ the prime minister said			2
idyllic setting : talks begin between the leaders of ( clockwise from lower left ) @entity94 , @entity29 , @entity33 , @entity95 , the @entity36 , the @entity76 , @entity96 , @entity42 , the @entity97 and the @entity98 relaxed : ( from left ) @entity29 prime minister @entity28 , @entity36 president @entity1 , @entity0 and @entity96 prime minister @entity28 listen cheerfully to @entity42 chancellor @entity30 during the @entity99 at @entity40 , @entity41 dress down : the eurozone may be in crisis but @entity0 looked remarkably laid back at the @entity99 , pictured alongside a grinning @entity96 pm @entity28 and @entity42 chancellor @entity30 @entity73 ’s caretaker government was sworn in this week after elections failed to produce a viable coalition to run the country			1
the result of new elections next month could determine whether the country accepts deep spending cuts set as the condition for an international bailout deal – or quits the bloc of 17 countries that use the @entity7			1
an exclusive poll for today ’s @entity115 has found that four in ten people believe @entity76 and the @entity23 would be better off in the long - run if all @entity7 nations went back to their own currencies			1
the view is backed by former @entity122 chancellor @entity121 , who today accuses mr @entity0 of talking ‘ complete nonsense ’ when describing the prospect of a ‘ successful @entity66 ’			1
the @entity126 poll reveals that one in six voters fear the break - up of the @entity7 would lead to riots across the continent			1
it also shows that @entity76 voters back left - wing @entity95 president @entity31 ’s demand for new investment to boost growth rather than mrs @entity30 and mr @entity0 ’s austerity stance			2
asked which @entity23 leader they back , mr @entity31 scores 32 per cent , followed by mr @entity0 on 20 per cent and mrs @entity30 on 16 per cent			2
the drastic ‘ @entity141 ’ plan , to be unveiled this week by the @entity140 , was written by @entity122 mps @entity142 and @entity143 , both tipped for ministerial promotion			1
the group ’s supporters include @entity122 mps @entity148 and @entity149 , senior advisers to mr @entity14 , and @entity151 , a former aide to mr @entity0			1
mr @entity142 writes in today ’s @entity126 : ‘ a currency meltdown would probably deepen recession in @entity154			2
further cuts in spending would have to be implemented			2
a cash freeze of benefits for three years would save significant amounts			1
it seems only fair people receiving benefits should also experience restraint			1
’ mr @entity142 said it could save £ 7 billion			1
the @entity140 also wants to copy @entity42 laws on ‘ flexible contracts ’ for people who earn less than £ 1,000 a month			1
‘ they would n’t have to pay any tax , yet employers could release them without any repercussions , ’ says mr @entity142			2
and he argues the government should reject the @entity23 ’s union - backed @entity174 and @entity177 regulations , which he said cost the @entity76 more than £ 5 billion a year			1
@entity178 attacked the ‘ @entity141 ’ plan			2
a senior official said : ‘ most of @entity154 is moving away from austerity measures			2
yet some @entity122 seem to think it is an excuse to bring in extreme right - wing measures			1
’ last night , disagreements between the @entity5 countries over the crisis appeared as pronounced as ever			1
mr @entity0 ’s emergency treadmill talks with president @entity1 came after the @entity42 sought to prevent the @entity5 from issuing any instructions on the eurozone			1
a dismayed president @entity1 intervened after aides to the @entity5 leaders sat up until 4am on friday arguing over details of a communiqué demanding action			1
@entity76 and @entity36 are concerned the @entity7 crisis will drag the world economy into freefall			1
non-euro countries including @entity33 and @entity94 all wanted to use the summit to force the @entity42 into action			2
a source close to mrs @entity30 admitted the aide talks were ‘ free and intense ’ – diplomatic speak for a blazing row			2
the @entity42 refused point - blank to let the @entity5 issue a call to action on the @entity66 , supported by @entity29 and @entity95			1
@entity76 is now demanding that the @entity42 let the @entity210 use quantitative easing to print money and give a monetary boost to the @entity66 economy			2
in a further complication , the man appointed by president @entity31 as his prime minister , @entity217 , said in an interview that he supported greater trade protectionism			2
last week , mr @entity0 said he wanted to lower trade barriers			2
last night , it was revealed that @entity76 is the only one of the world ’s eight major economies set to meet its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid next year			2
a report issued at the summit shows the average for the @entity5 last year was just 0.28 per cent			1
a no 10 spokesperson said : ‘ @entity76 is proud it has met its commitments , but we want others to do the same			0
’ but @entity122 mp @entity236 fumed : ‘ it makes us look like the mugs of the western world			1
' picturesque : @entity30 and her aides arrive at @entity40 , set high in the @entity242 , for a bilateral meeting with mr @entity28 back to nature : chancellor @entity30 ( second from right ) and mr @entity28 ( right ) hold talks over coffee in @entity40 's idyllic woodland setting keep up , @entity0 : mr @entity1 and @entity30 ( in purple ) lead the pack as the @entity5 representatives stroll through @entity40 new addition : recently elected @entity95 president @entity31 ( left ) shares a joke with the @entity36 president as @entity30 and @entity0 line up on the lawn by @entity258 hair carefully arranged , huge sunglasses adding to her chic air , the elderly woman had the undoubted look of a lady who lunched			1
once , perhaps , her rendezvous would have been with old friends in a smart restaurant close to @entity268 ’ embassy district			0
today her appointment was with charity – but she accepted her handout of bean soup in a plastic bowl with all the grace she could muster			0
it was only when she realised that the outside world , in the form of a photographer and myself , were witnessing her ‘ shame ’ that she faltered			0
horrified , she turned away , refusing to discuss the circumstances that had brought her to this municipal ‘ soup kitchen ’			0
handouts : @entity287 , a smartly dressed man takes soup in @entity268 while , right , the elderly kitchen visitor clings to dignity as a fellow diner eats ravenously ‘ she has nothing left but her dignity , ’ said a worker who approached her on our behalf			0
‘ she only started coming here in the past few weeks , and it is still so very hard for her			0
it will be her one meal of the day			0
‘ but there are more and more like her now			0
at first it was the immigrants and the illegals ; the homeless			0
now they ’ve been joined by the young , the professionals , the middle class			0
and every day more come			0
’ on their knees , but refusing to be beaten by @entity308 and eurozone demands , the @entity73 are clinging on to that dignity			0
they are painfully aware that they have been presented to the rest of the world as a work - shy , tax - dodging , culturally corrupt nation who created their own downfall and now refuse to pay for it			0
but they already have paid for it			0
a quarter of @entity73 firms have gone bust in three years ; employment is at 22 per cent and rising ; new property taxes have hit all , as have massive salary , pension and welfare cuts			0
yet , on the surface , as one walks through @entity268 ’ chaotic streets , all appears surprisingly normal			0
shops still trade and the ubiquitous yellow taxis whizz round with passengers			0
@entity334 , a 28 - year - old journalist on a local newspaper who is now being paid two months in arrears , says : ‘ we ’re a proud people			0
i still like to put on a show – sit in the café , all dressed up – it ’s something we do , and all looks normal			0
but stick around for a while and you ’ll notice we hold one drink all evening			0
’ quietly every day , and the figure is rising , at least 4,000 are fed by the charity of the city , the churches and individual communities			0
some say that figure is a woeful underestimate			0
schools have been given extra meals for children who have been fainting with hunger			0
for @entity358 , vice mayor of @entity268 , this aid is not in question			0
‘ there is an old @entity73 saying of which i am proud , ’ he says			0
‘ the city is mother to the poor			0
’ back at the soup kitchen , volunteers like @entity369 , dole out the food			0
‘ we ’re seeing them younger and younger , ’ she says			0
‘ and also professional couples who ’ve lost their jobs			0
in three months the queue has changed , and that is very frightening for our future			0

as @entity5 leaders gather at @entity40 to patch up @entity7 deal , @entity122 plot to use crisis to axe £ *7billion* of benefits
