@entity1 cafe culture is often held up as a model of responsible drinking			1
but adopting it in @entity6 would have a detrimental effect on the nation ’s health , an expert warned yesterday			2
while the @entity6 has some of the highest levels of binge drinking in @entity15 , the overall amount of alcohol consumed by the average @entity12 is lower than that drunk by people in many continental countries			1
no better : the continental ' cafe drinking culture ' practiced in @entity20 and @entity21 , pictured , can be just as harmful as binge drinking as a result , the number of alcohol - related deaths in @entity6 is lower than in countries such as @entity20 , @entity26 and @entity21			1
dr @entity27 , research manager for the charity @entity28 , said the idea that continental - style daily drinking is healthier than binge drinking is a myth			2
‘ in public health terms , making alcohol part of our everyday life in that way is not going to help at all , ’ he said			2
‘ if anything , it will make matters worse and cost the @entity40 even more			0
‘ there is this assumption that there are a number of @entity46 countries we should look at as a model for drinking , such as @entity20 , @entity26 and @entity21			1
‘ but their overall levels of alcohol consumption are higher than @entity6			1
there is this view that the regular continental approach does not cause harm			0
binge @entity6 : the @entity6 's high levels of binge drinking is often mocked in other @entity15 countries , but experts say that the idea that daily drinking of smaller amounts is healthier is myth ‘ in fact it does , but it is just less visible			1
it is not the public order harm that is associated with binge drinking , but the damage to health is just as pronounced , if not more so			2
‘ we need to get away from the idea that there is either binge drinking or continental - style daily drinking			0
there is harm associated with both			0
’ a study published last year found that overall individual alcohol consumption was higher in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity20 , @entity26 and @entity21 than in the @entity6			1
the number of alcohol - attributable deaths was also higher in all these nations , with more than 15 per cent of male deaths linked to drinking in @entity20 and @entity26 , compared with around 8 per cent in @entity6			1
the researchers , from the @entity88 in @entity89 , classified alcohol - related deaths as including cases of liver disease , chronic pancreatitis , alcohol poisoning and fatal injuries			0
worse : researchers found that in countries with ' cafe culture ' drinking such as @entity20 , pictured , overall individual alcohol consumption was higher than in the @entity6 the government is expected soon to announce plans for a minimum price for a unit of alcohol			1
dr @entity104 , from @entity105 , has investigated the likely effect of a 40p minimum price			0
his team ’s research found that such a policy would have minimal effect on moderate drinkers , costing them less than £ 7 annually , but would cut consumption by almost 5 per cent for harmful drinkers , and reduce deaths by almost 10,000 in a decade			0
he said implementing the plan would almost certainly force supermarkets to end ‘ three bottles for £ 10 ’ offers on wine and cheap deals on crates of beer			0
a 40p minimum unit price would reduce overall alcohol use by 2.4 per cent , leading to a crime reduction rate of 10,100 annually , while the saving to the @entity40 would be £ 626million over ten years , he added			0
figures out yesterday show that men are twice as likely as women to die from alcohol - related causes			0
in 2011 , two - thirds of the 8,748 alcohol - related deaths in the @entity6 were men and a third were women , the @entity131 said .			2

@entity6 should not try to import ' cafe drinking culture ' from the continent
overall individual alcohol consumption higher in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity26
@entity142 drinking of small amounts ' is not going to help at all , ' expert say
