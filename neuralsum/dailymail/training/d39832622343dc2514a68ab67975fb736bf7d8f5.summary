@entity3 , 35 , had worn glasses since the age of 12 , but is now able to see perfectly			1
the father - of - one had only just returned from honeymoon with his wife @entity10 in 2011 when he began suffering headaches			1
‘ we had been to @entity27 and i had put them down to too many cocktails , ’ said mr @entity3 , from @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25			1
‘ i was getting dizzy and bad - tempered but i thought i was just having a bad few weeks after lying on a beach for a fortnight , ' he said			2
but when he fell down the stairs at work , he realised something was seriously wrong			2
a ct scan uncovered a tumour in his brain which it is believed he had had for more than two decades			1
doctors were forced to perform an immediate craniotomy to cut open mr @entity3 ’s skull and remove the non-cancerous tumour , which was pushing down on his brain			1
when he woke up after the operation , he suddenly realised he could see			0
he said : ‘ it was amazing			0
i was sitting in the hospital without my glasses on and all of a sudden i realised i could see without them on			2
‘ i went for a walk around and tried to look at things i could n't see without them before , and everything was clear			0
‘ i went to see an optician who confirmed i did n't need them any longer			0
my eyes are completely different to how they were before			0
’ without treatment , the growth would have put further pressure on the brain , and could have caused fits or permanent brain damage			2
mrs @entity63 , 30 , said : ‘ it was a very scary time for us			0
we 'd only just got married and they started talking about the possibility of @entity3 being left paralysed or without his memory			1

doctors later diagnosed him with a benign brain tumour , pictured right this then had to be drained regularly following his operation to make sure a build - up of fluid did n't occur			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ my head swelled up massively			1
‘ it was the most horrendous thing i have ever seen			0
’ mr and mrs @entity63 spent @entity92 and @entity93 in hospital while he recovered from surgery before he was given a three - month course of radiotherapy to blast any further cells that could have become cancerous			1
during his treatment mr @entity3 's wife , @entity10 , discovered that she was expecting their first child he had surgery to remove the non-cancerous tumour , after which he discovered he no longer needed to wear glasses double blow : @entity3 , pictured above in hospital , was told he and his wife @entity10 may not be able to have children following the radiation treatment and six - centimetre incision in his head surgeons had to cut out a four by six centimetre hole into mr @entity3 ’s head in order to remove the tumour			1
this , however , meant a further blow for the couple , who were told that due to the radiation exposure on mr @entity3 ’s pituitary gland , it was very unlikely they would be able to have children			1
‘ we were absolutely devastated , ’ mrs @entity63 said			0
‘ although we had n't really planned having children , we always knew it was something we wanted to do eventually			0
‘ it seemed like our whole world was falling apart in just a matter of weeks			0
’ but just weeks later , the couple discovered they were expecting their first child , and mrs @entity63 gave birth to @entity73 in november 2012			0
‘ we were over the moon , ’ said @entity10			0
‘ it was the most amazing end to the worst year of our lives especially as we had been told it was unlikely we would be able to have children			0
‘ @entity3 was back to normal so it was the icing on the cake			1
’ full of energy : @entity3 is fitter and faster than ever before now that the golf ball - sized growth , which was pushing down on his brain , has been dislodged fitter than ever : @entity3 says he feels better than ever before following the operation last year mr @entity3 says he is also fitter and healthier than ever before having had the growth , which was pushing down on his brain , removed			1
the father - of - one , who had his life - saving operation in december 2011 , said : ‘ i have got more energy than i had even as a 20 - year - old			1
‘ i was always at the top of my game - i was able to run marathons and keep up with criminals			2
‘ but , after having the tumour removed , i can run faster , jump higher and my strength and energy levels have massively improved			2
his wife @entity10 added : ‘ he 's like a new man now			0
he 's just got bags of energy			0
i had always known him to be so bubbly and jubilant that when he started becoming grumpy and tired , i knew he was n't himself			0
’ mr @entity3 is now training for the @entity164 on april 21			2
he will be raising money for the research team of @entity167 at @entity168 where he was treated			0
‘ i could n't have asked for a better consultant , ’ said @entity3			2

’ to sponsor mr @entity3 visit www.gofundme.com/29xte8 brain tumours can affect the optic nerve itself or the cranial nerves that control eye movement			1
tumours in different parts of the brain affect different nerves and often affect several nerves at once			2
which nerves they affect determine what the symptoms will be			0
tumours in the pituitary gland - the pea - sized gland at the base of the skull which secretes hormones - can cause the loss of lateral vision in both eyes and can cause blindness if left untreated			2
there are four lobes in the brain and a lesion in the temporal lobe - the part of the brain responsible for speech , movement , personality , behaviour , reasoning and judgement - can cause loss of vision in one quarter of the visual field			1
tumours in the occipital lobe - the part of the brain that processes vision - can cause the area of the brain responsible for interpretation of visual signals to malfunction , resulting in blindness .			1
