a pr executive for major media company @entity1 who tweeted a racist ' joke ' on friday that sparked a social media revolt has been fired from her position following the incident			1
@entity6 - the now - former communications director for @entity1 , a company owned by @entity8 - was about to board a 12 - hour flight from @entity10 to @entity11 when she tweeted : ' going to @entity12			1
hope i do n't get @entity14			1
i 'm white ! ' the post had been retweeted over 3,000 times and was picked up by media outlets around the world , however @entity6 remained completely unaware of it all because she was in the air			1
the blonde publicist was pictured arriving in @entity11 looking shocked and talking on her phone			0
moments later the offending tweet and @entity6 's @entity25 account disappeared			1
a spokeswoman for the company has now confirmed @entity6 has indeed been sacked			1
flying into the storm : this photo , snapped by @entity25 user @entity30 , was taken as @entity6 got off a 12 hour flight at @entity11 airport after arriving from @entity10			1
the pr representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist @entity25 had created while she was in the air @entity6 has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to @entity12 career suicide : @entity1 says that they will take ' appropriate action ' against the tweet sent by @entity6 ( pictured above in shots from her @entity46 account ) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job ' there is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally , ' a rep told @entity54			1
' the offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of @entity1			0
' we take this issue very seriously , and we have parted ways with the employee in question			1
' @entity6 was blasted for being ' outrageous ' and ' inappropriate ' , with titles like ' @entity64 ' stacking up against her			2
despite deleting the @entity25 , the damage had been done in those 12 hours she was flying			0
before confirming they had fired her , @entity1 released an earlier statement condemning @entity6 's behavior as ' outrageous and offensive '			1
' this is an outrageous , offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of @entity1			2
unfortunately , the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight , but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action , ' a representative from @entity1 told the @entity78			1
@entity6 landed in @entity12 on @entity79 43 about 11.30pm friday and one can only imagine the number of angry responses she would have recieved once turning her cell phone on			1
one man , @entity83 , tweeted that he went to the airport specifically to see her and took photos of her arrival			0
the @entity11 local also claimed to have spoken to @entity6 's father , who is @entity88			2
the hashtag ' # hasjustinelandedyet ' was trending on @entity25 around the world at the time as thousands awaited @entity6 's response			1
the @entity94 was fascinated with the fact that as all the drama she caused unfolded , @entity6 was blissfully unaware of any it up in the air			2
in february 2012 @entity99 had tweeted : ' i had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night			1
' then about 12 hours before the racist @entity25 , she wrote : ' @entity104 : you 're in first class			2
get some deodorant ' - @entity110 monologue as i inhale @entity112			0
' however it was ' joke ' about @entity12 and @entity14 that caused the commotion			1
@entity25 user @entity118 wrote in response : ' wow ! reinforce the ignorant @entity122 stereotype much ? ' @entity123 tweeted : ' are you even real ? ! ? this is utterly ghastly on so many levels			2
' @entity127 wrote : ' listen , homegirl is about to be fired			0
' @entity129 stated that there is a possibility that the young pr executive 's account may have been hacked			0
however that is unlikely as her twitter profile has a number of other tweets that may also be deemed offensive			0
@entity6 wrote wrote : ' i ca n't be fired for things i say while intoxicated right ? ' @entity6 also wrote : ' i like animals , but when it 's this cold out i 'll skin one myself for the fur ' and tweeted the comment directly at @entity146 , a famous animal rights organization			1
the @entity148 alum also tweeted : ' last day of hurricane season			0
ca n't wait for evacuations next year			0
' ironically enough , @entity148 is located in @entity151 , a city in which more than half of the population is black , according to @entity155			0
@entity151 also suffered tremendously after @entity156 decimated homes , took several lives , and wrecked the local economy			0
one @entity25 user took it so far as to create a fake profile for @entity6 named @entity162			2
her byline reads , ' pr disaster			0
' one of the mock tweets reads , ' i think the lady across the aisle is clicking at me			0
i 'm sorry ... i do n't speak @entity171 # whitesanta # longestflightever # haveilandedyet ' another mock tweet reads , ' @ @entity173 downing # @entity174 all flight in support of # @entity177 ! @entity178 sent me a @entity179 , but i sent it back ! ' joke 's on her : @entity6 's tweet inspired twitter users like this one to make a mock page dedicated to her racist comments you most certainly can : this tweet @entity6 wrote in january may have been a self fulfilling prophecy what a mess : @entity6 will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter the @entity193 tried contacting @entity1 's media relations department , and since the contact listed on their website was @entity6 herself , no one was available for comment			1
upon looking at the @entity1 website again , her name has been removed and has been replaced with ' corporate communications			0
' the voice mail which previously gave out her personal cell phone number for media inquiries with a strict deadline , has also been changed			0
the reason @entity6 is traveling to @entity12 is still unknown , but chances are that @entity6 wo n't get the warmest @entity211 welcome			1
according to dosomething.org out of the 34 million people in the world who have @entity214 , 69 percent live in @entity12			0
there are around 23.8 million people in @entity12 with @entity14			2
@entity14 ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) is caused by the @entity214 ( human immunodeficiency syndrome )			2
it can be transmitted via sexual intercourse , blood to blood contact , or childbirth			0
@entity214 greatly lowers the human immune system making it easier for those infected to carry fatal diseases			0

@entity6 has been sacked following the furor her racist and *insensitive* @entity25 caused after it went viral
she caused a @entity25 revolt on friday after posting : ' going to @entity12 . hope i do n't get @entity14 . just kidding . i 'm white ! '
she has not yet issued an apology or explanation
@entity6 was the head pr representative of @entity1 , owned by @entity8 and responsible for websites like @entity240 , @entity241 , and @entity242 to name a few
