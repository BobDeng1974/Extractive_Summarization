this i ’m looking forward to			0
’ see video below ... @entity85 : @entity4 and @entity5 said their day job was in a sandwich shop on @entity13 's @entity12 cruising to stardom : despite claiming that they work in a sandwich shop , @entity56 and @entity92 have sung on cruise ships and are seen here on the show cruising with the @entity96 rising stars : @entity56 and @entity92 have a website , have sung on cruise ships and were billed as ' the @entity99 ' when they appeared on loose women the pair received a standing ovation for their performance of musical hit @entity106			1
