snubbed : @entity1 's @entity0 only received a single @entity3 nomination - in the stunt category she has described her latest directing project unbroken as ' the hardest thing i 've ever done ' , but @entity1 's efforts were snubbed at the @entity3 nominations on wednesday			1
unbroken received a single nomination in the less showy category of @entity12 by a @entity13 , but the film 's leading man @entity14 missed out on an acting nod			0
@entity1 's snub came as @entity18 celebrated a nomination in the @entity21 category for her performance as a woman racked with chronic pain in indie drama cake			2
other big movies not considered in any of the acting categories - including the prestigious @entity28 - include @entity31 's space fantasy movie @entity29 and @entity34 film @entity32 , although the latter 's omission is possibly due to a late send out of screeners to @entity39 members			1
@entity42 movie @entity29 's poor performance could be partially due to its mixed reviews and less than stellar performance at the @entity46 box office			2
meanwhile , star - studded @entity48 - directed musical @entity47 landed @entity49 yet another nomination for her role as the witch but the movie - set to be released this @entity53 - missed out in the ensemble category			2
and despite @entity56 being nominated as outstanding lead actress , @entity55 did n't win any acclaim for its star - studded cast which included @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
among the actors , @entity64 's lack of nomination for @entity66 as the wife of a shady oil salesman in 1981 @entity69 , was surprising to many commentators , while @entity72 missed out for @entity74 @entity73 and @entity75 was omitted for @entity77 's @entity76			0
@entity96 missed out for his drunken , gambling retiree in @entity99 but maybe it 's no surprise that @entity101 was overlooked in mr @entity102 , with the category described by @entity104 as ' one of the most competitive and crowded ever '			1
the same goes for @entity106 , who despite beefing up for the role of @entity109 @entity108 in @entity110 , did n't get a nod for the @entity113 - directed drama about @entity108 , who was involved in numerous secret raids on @entity115			0
no nod for @entity64 : @entity117 missed out on a nomination for @entity66 missing out : @entity106 missed out on an acting nomination for @entity46 sniper but will he get an @entity122 nod ? @entity32 star @entity123 missed out on a @entity3 nomination , reportedly because not enough screeners of the @entity34 film get sent out in time @entity128 actor @entity123 was also widely anticipated to make the cut in the @entity131 category for playing @entity34 in @entity133 â€™s drama @entity32 about 1965 civil rights marches			1
according to @entity104 , @entity32 will almost certainly be one of the frontrunners come @entity122 time , alongside war time codebreaker drama @entity137 and @entity140 's groundbreaking drama @entity138 , famously shot over an 11 year period and starring @entity143 and @entity144			1
less than stellar : @entity31 film interstellar starring @entity42 and @entity146 was not recognised by @entity3 scoop for @entity49 : @entity49 received yet another nomination but musical @entity47 missed out over on the @entity153 side , @entity150 and @entity151 were snubbed for the second year running , with nominations in the @entity156 category instead going to @entity158 's @entity157 , @entity159 of @entity160 , @entity161 for @entity162 and @entity164 's @entity163 and @entity42			1
it is also the first time in four years that @entity167 has not received a nod in the @entity169 drama actress category for @entity172			2
and perhaps in an indication that @entity3 members very much dance to their own tune , @entity177 , who scooped an @entity179 for playing dr @entity180 in @entity181 , missed out on a nomination for the @entity184 drama at the @entity185			0
no @entity3 love : @entity167 missed out on a nomination for @entity172 while @entity150 was overlooked for @entity151 one @entity179 , no @entity3 : despite co-star @entity189 's triple nod , @entity177 was not among the nominees on wednesday for @entity181 new dramas were also snubbed , with @entity193 's @entity192 , @entity195 's @entity194 and @entity197 drama @entity198 getting short shrift			1
@entity3 nominees are voted by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites			0
the voters are split in half , with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film			0
following the polling process the full body of both @entity3 and @entity212 ( @entity214 's acting unions ) then decides upon the winners in each category			0
the @entity3 winners will be announced on january 25 2015			0
