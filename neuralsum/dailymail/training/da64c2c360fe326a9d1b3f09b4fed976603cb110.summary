for @entity3 the @entity0 , centre court of the @entity2 , might be better named the @entity4			1
exhausting marathons , knee and back injuries , retirements , shattering defeats and now cramps in his stomach and elsewhere			1
he has been through them all there , apart from when winning the title in 2009			2
@entity16 : @entity3 wins 2 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 3 - 6 5 - 7 vs @entity18 @entity3 had to dig deep to overcome illness and poor form in order to defeat @entity18 the @entity22 slumped to his knees after winning match point after a gruelling four hour eight minute battle it is hard to see him replicating that triumph this time around , the evidence coming in his dramatic 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 win over little - known @entity31 @entity18			1
for long spells it seemed the world no 112 was going to remove @entity36 ’s potential semi-final opponent , assuming the @entity38 player survives his coming third round against @entity41 ’s @entity40			1
@entity3 has banked precious little in the way of wins or confidence since @entity46 last year			1
that was a major factor in the physical difficulties which he just about overcame to see off a player who was beaten by @entity51 4 @entity52 in his usual @entity54 circuit environment less than three months ago			2
he referred to cramps in different parts of his body as the reason for his undulating performance , against an albeit inspired opponent			2
‘ i was suffering , ’ he said			2
what is sure is that @entity3 ’s warrior fighting instinct has survived his long lay - off , although he can not have felt the cramps for a sustained period as it is simply not possible to play tennis of this intensity over a match of nearly four and a quarter hours if you are continually ill. @entity3 required attention from the doctors during the second set after complaining of feeling weak clearly suffering , it looked as though @entity3 may crash out but he rallied to win in five sets before @entity36 can contemplate any semi-final , he must overcome the speedy @entity40 , who has an unlikely connection with @entity78			1
@entity40 is the @entity80 manager ’s relatively humble stablemate in the management group controlled by ‘ super agent ’ @entity83 , who also looks after @entity84			2
but so far removed from @entity83 ’ star clients is @entity40 that he has never even met @entity78 , unlike @entity36 , who has done rehab work at their @entity88 facility and consulted him privately several times about how to handle the pressure of top - level sport			1
@entity40 , the world no 55 , is under no illusions about his own status			2
‘ i have never called myself the @entity96 , not even close , ’ he said			2
@entity78 turned up at the @entity97 in november , only to see @entity36 hammered by @entity98 at the @entity99			0
but @entity40 has not got that close			0
‘ i have n’t had the honour of meeting him but he is one of the greatest professionals in sport			0
i hope to meet him one day , ’ he said			0
@entity3 leans over a sponsor board to clear his throat as he struggled with illness during the match @entity31 qualifier @entity18 , more used to the @entity54 circuit , pushed @entity3 all the way in @entity113 @entity3 will play @entity115 's @entity114 in the third round after making it safely through @entity36 made it through with an extremely comfortable 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 win over @entity121 ’s @entity120			1
also through is @entity98 , who was bitten by something on the tip of the small finger of his right hand , causing some slight swelling			0
he was still able to beat @entity128 @entity127 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2			1
@entity36 ’s biggest irritation since being here has been being woken at 6am last week for a random blood test which was ordered by @entity38 anti-doping			0
he stressed , though , that he was in favour of the increased testing taking place in tennis through its biological passport programme			0
‘ it was 6am a few days before a major			0
what time is unreasonable ? ’ he asked			0
‘ but they need to do it , definitely more			0
i think everyone is getting tested here when they lose , so for me it would be three tests in two weeks or so , a lot more than it used to be			0
’ you would expect him to get past @entity40 to set up a possible fourth round against @entity150			1
when they played in the second round here two years ago , @entity40 only managed to win eight games			1
@entity36 has a record against @entity121 that @entity156 ’s touring cricketers would love to emulate , leading them 10 - 0 over the course of his career			1
and @entity120 spoke very highly of the @entity160 ’s form			0
‘ that ’s the best @entity162 ’s played against me , ’ he said			0
‘ he was good at the @entity163 when he beat me and went on to the semis , at @entity166 ’s when he went on to win there and then @entity46 , but this was pretty impressive			1
‘ he can go all the way			0
he has a tough passage in the second week with @entity98 , @entity3 , but he can win it .			1

@entity3 beat @entity172 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3 7 - 5 in @entity113
@entity22 complained of feeling weak and needed medical attention
match with @entity31 *journeyman* @entity172 lasted over four hours
@entity3 will play @entity115 's @entity114 in @entity2 third round
