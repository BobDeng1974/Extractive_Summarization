by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 01:39 est , 16 may 2012 @entity1 has lifted the lid on some of their new green methods for handling the billions of emails they deal with each and every day			1
and in typical @entity1 feel - good fashion , they decided to demonstrate their methods in a cute animation full of whimsical imagery , showing our emails bouncing through cables as cats play on rooftops and cars trundle along the road			2
' @entity19 ' , as @entity1 terms it , takes us on a journey which starts when your email - or @entity27 , assuming you are using @entity1 's email system - bounces out of your laptop , and ends when the email arrives on the recipient 's smartphone			1
although the animation is a colourful land where @entity1 employees skate through the data banks and listen to their music through their headphones , clicking on any of the various @entity34 buttons that dot the landscape lead into very serious documentaries about how @entity1 reduces their power needs and uses green technology to reduce the search engine 's impact on the environment			2
along the way , we also learn some fascinating facts about their data farm - for instance employees work in @entity47 shirts and shorts rather than waste energy on air - conditioning the giant vaults containing thousands of hard drives , or how 100 @entity1 searches equals the amount of power used to light a light - bulb for 28 minutes			1
some of the tidbits revealed by @entity1 include how the company keeps its data centres - those vast warehouses full of hard - drives storing @entity1 's colossal amounts of data - at a warm 80 degrees @entity64 ( @entity65 ) , rather than spend a lot of energy and money keeping air - conditioning the building			1
instead , the company simply asks its workers to wear shorts to work			2
also , the company says that : ' since 2007 , we ’ve recycled enough servers to avoid buying over 90,000 replacement machines			2
we always look for ways to reuse what we have , and when we ca n’t , we completely erase any data components and resell them			0
' we ’re proud that we recycle 100 % of the electronic equipment that leaves our data centers			1
' other little facts that appear on the animation include how a user streaming three days of @entity86 uses the equivalent energy it takes to manufacture , package and deliver one dvd , and how using 100 searches uses the same amount of energy as using a @entity95 light bulb for 28 minutes			0
@entity1 headquarters in @entity97 , @entity98 , where @entity1 co-founders and presidents @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 are based and , if you are scared of sending private emails , or using ' cloud ' services , whereby companies like @entity1 , @entity108 or @entity109 look after your data and can stream it to multiple devices , @entity1 wants you to know there are some real - world security options built into their data farms			0
the company says : ' we understand the importance of keeping your personal data secure			0
that ’s why we protect your message with a wide range of security measures			0
security cameras , iris scans and fingerprint scans at our data centers are just a few of the measures we take to secure and protect your information			0
' the company also states they use renewable energy for more than 30 % of our operations			0
although @entity1 may be simply trying to score some ' green ' points , it is fascinating to see the journey of a @entity27 from start to finish - and as @entity1 themselves say : ' this whole trip took just seconds and happens billions of times a day			1

@entity1 reveals how ' @entity27 ' travels from your home , through *underground* wires and into @entity1 's ' @entity145 ' , before going on to your recipient
@entity1 asks its employees to work in shorts rather than air - condition *gigantic* arrays of *computer* hard drives
company ' recycles 100 % of *hardware* equipment ' - avoiding the purchase of 90,000 new *computer*s since 2007
' this whole trip took just seconds and happens billions of times a day . '
