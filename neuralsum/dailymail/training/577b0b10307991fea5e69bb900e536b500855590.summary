no trains : a deserted @entity66 train station in @entity24 yesterday as many railway services were cancelled not moving : a fallen tree is pictured on top of a destroyed car in @entity71 , north @entity24 , following the storm forums and message boards were flooded with comments , with some people complaining that rail companies had been giving confusing and unreliable advice about the services they were running			1
