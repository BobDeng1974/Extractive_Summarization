some at @entity0 believe that , in @entity2 , they have signed the player who will go on to be the best left back in the world			1
certainly , @entity6 chief executive @entity5 had told people how pleased he is with the arrival of the teenage defender			0
some of have questioned the transfer fee			0
that , though , will be rendered largely irrelevant if @entity2 goes on to play for the club for a decade			2
remember that some people thought £ 30m was too much money for @entity16 back in 2002			1
his club manager @entity32 has recognised that and much of the the player 's work on a daily basis at @entity0 's @entity38 training ground is understood to focus on the basic nuts and bolts of his defending			1
modern full backs play a different game than those that came before them			0
many of them are encouraged to be attacking players first and defenders second			0
in @entity2 , it is easy to detect a bit of that			2
for @entity55 and the way he likes his teams to play , that does not necessarily represent a fundamental problem			0
for example , as he was extolling the virtues of a three - man defensive system to his players shortly after his arrival , he told his wing backs that he saw them as ' mainly attackers '			0
@entity2 , however , does look significantly better in one half of the field than the other and that , over time , perhaps needs to be addressed			2
@entity2 impressed against @entity21 and formed a fine partnership with winger @entity71 ( below ) against @entity21 for @entity0 at @entity6 , for example , the 19 - year - old was exceptional at times in the other half of the field			1
his understanding with @entity71 appears to have developed immediately and the two of them gave @entity79 right back a terrible time for much of the afternoon			2
it was the @entity21 right back , though , whom @entity2 brought down to concede a penalty			1
@entity2 thought he was hard done by			1
it was a reckless , impetuous tackle and that was n't the only example of the young player getting it wrong that day			0
@entity55 , it must be said , did n't know that much about @entity2 on arriving at @entity0			1
his early concerns about his charge 's fitness – the defender was carrying extra pounds during pre-season in @entity95 – were made clear but what did impress the new @entity0 manager is the manner in which the player responded			1
@entity2 admits he must improve defensively after giving away a penalty following a foul on @entity79 the left back was taken off injured with a knee problem but is fit enough to feature for @entity28 's youth side ' it 's something i have got to work on , ' admitted @entity2 subsequently			1
' it was a surprise when i got to @entity0			2
' i did n't come into @entity0 thinking it would be much harder			2
that 's something that i think i made a mistake on			0
' @entity2 's efforts at @entity38 have , by all accounts , been impressive since @entity0 's return from tour			1
@entity55 noticed them immediately and was happy to enough to take @entity28 coach @entity17 to task when he suggested @entity2 had issues with general fitness going back to his @entity117 days			1
@entity32 has been impressed with @entity2 's effort in training after initially questioning his fitness @entity2 was not picked for the @entity28 senior squad but sitting on the bench would do nothing for him @entity124 grapples with the young star during an under 21 training session at @entity127 ' he [ @entity17 ] has not been here to see him train , ' said @entity55			1
' he has been an example to the others			0
' having just recovered from a hamstring injury , @entity2 limped off with a bang to the knee on sunday			2
it is not serious and he should start for @entity137 's under 21 team against @entity138 this week			0
it may feel like a demotion , but it should n't			0
at this stage of his career , he is better playing competitive football than sitting on the bench watching @entity145			0

@entity0 were delighted to sign @entity2 in the *summer*
@entity150 arrived for £ 31m from @entity117 but has *struggled* with injuries
impressed against @entity21 and formed partnership with @entity71
@entity16 cost £ 30m and everybody thought that was too much at first
@entity28 under 21 call - up is better for @entity2 's development right now
