in these fantastic images you can see @entity2 and its moons , an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water			1
or can you ? these might look like pictures of space at first , but they ’re actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier			1
the amazing photography trick was performed by 34 - year - old freelance photographer @entity17 from @entity18			1
@entity18 photographer @entity17 has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen			1
shown is a ' spiral galaxy ' , made with baking soda , curry powder , chalk , salt , sugar and cinnamon the project follows an imaginary spacecraft called @entity32 - which you can follow on @entity34 , @entity35 or his website			2
in the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images			1
- @entity42 containing water and food colouring - @entity45 , cinnamon , baking powder - @entity49 fur , cumin , tumeric - coffee , corn starch , butter he told @entity56 that the images were made by placing objects on an @entity60 photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open			1
he then partially filled glasses with liquids and put food colouring in them in order to create shapes and swirls			0
the stars and other points of light , meanwhile , are made by sprinkling spices such as cinnamon on the scanner glass			0
‘ i 've had a fascination with space ever since i was a kid camping in the backyard and looking at the stars through my childhood telescope , ’ he said			2
‘ when i see the cosmos through photographs taken by the @entity83 and other spacecraft , i ’m often left without words			0
‘ when i look at the night sky , i ’m captivated by its mystery and its unknowns			0
i think the awe and wonder of space ignites our innate curiosity as humans			0
’ this @entity2 - lke planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half , water and food colouring			0
moons at the bottom of a glass contain coconut milk , wate and food colouring			0
the stars are salt , cinnamon , baking powder and tums all the images were taken in a photocopier			0
here we see a nebula with gas streams - but it is actually cat fur , garlic powder , salt , flour , cumin and turmeric , according to mr @entity17 this planet consists of the bottom of a glass with half and half milk , water and food colouring			2
the starts are salt , cinnamon and baking powder a distant galaxy ? no , thi is olive oil , sesame oil , water , cumin , cinnamon and flour in a photocopier some of the glasses use just water , and others use a mixture of coconut milky as well			2
one of the nebulas was created using cat fur , garlic powder , salt , flour , cumin and turmeric			0
and mr @entity17 says he intends to continue take the photos , so people can keep following the fictional progress of the @entity159 probe ‘ i thought it would be fun and exciting to frame the project around the idea of this imaginary spacecraft roaming around the universe taking photos of its encounters , ’ he said			1
baking soda , salt , sugar , curry powder and cinnamon were used to make this ' globular cluster ' this nebula is a mixture of makeup , olive oil , chalk , baby powder , salt and water this icy planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half , water and food colouring			0
the moons are silica gel and food colouring , while the stars are made of sugar , cinnamon and cumin this supercluster is made of flour , sugar , salt , olive oil , cumin , turmeric , cinnamon , curry , garlic powder and water ‘ i had a whole story going for a while of how i was selected to be the lead image processor for the @entity159 mission since i 'm a photographer but have a degree in engineering and that this was a real spacecraft out there taking images			1
‘ a lot of people actually thought it was reall ! eventually i decided to tell people how i really make the images and that @entity159 is entirely fictional			1
’ he added : ‘ i 'd like people to look at these images and think could my fictional creation of a planet or moon or galaxy actually exist somewhere in our universe or possibly even beyond ? ‘ i 'd like for the imaginary explorations of @entity159 to inspire others about the cosmos and actual space exploration			1
’ this ghostly anomaly is made of butter , food colouring and salt the bottom of a glass of coffee here looks a bit like a black hole , together with salt , sugar , corn starch and cinnamon this planet in deep space is two glasses containing half and half , coconut milk , water and food colouring			2

@entity18 photographer @entity17 has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen
they appear to show planets and nebulae in the universe , but they are actually glasses of water and spices
he used a photocopier to capture the *replica* images of the cosmos as part of the @entity270 project
‘ i 'd like for the imaginary explorations of @entity159 to inspire others about the cosmos , ' he told @entity56
