by @entity0 last updated at 2:26 pm on 23rd november 2011 sickening details of a plan to slaughter endangered orang - utans were revealed today with the arrest of two men taking part in a hunt - and - kill operation in the jungles of @entity9			1
the palm oil workers were accused by police of hacking to death 20 orang - utans and a number of proboscis monkeys			1
but it is feared many more have been slaughtered			0
endangered : @entity9 is home to 90 per cent of the 50,000 orang - utans left in the wild ( library image of a baby orang - utan ) for each kill , the men were paid $ us100 ( £ 64 ) for a dead orang - utan and $ 22 ( £ 14 ) for a monkey - a fortune on the island of @entity29 , where @entity9 has sovereignty over two thirds of the land			1
the @entity33 revealed earlier this month that hundreds of orang - utans have been killed for food by villagers in @entity29 in recent years as man and beast struggle for survival			1
the arrest this week of the two palm oil workers is the first evidence that the slaughter is continuing despite appeals for it to stop			0
police said that although the men admitted killing the animals - under orders from a supervisor - between 2008 and 2010 officials believed the slaughter is continuing in a number of areas in @entity55 , the @entity9 part of @entity29			2
the arrested men were paid £ 64 for a dead orang - utan and £ 14 for a dead proboscis monkey ( pictured from library image ) the arrested men , who come from the village of @entity62 , have admitted to police that they chased the animals , bringing them down with rifle shots before stabbing them or hacking them to death with machetes			1
among the evidence against the men , said the @entity70 , were photographs of the slain animals and buried bones unearthed near the palm plantation			0
' this is the result of oil palm plantation owners trying to protect their crops from hungry orang - utans , ' said police spokesman colonel @entity79			1
' it 's one of those unfortunate situations where farmers are taking more land as the population grows , or where demand for cooking oil increases , and the habitat of the orang - utans gets smaller			2
' mr @entity79 said that if convicted the oil palm hunters would face up to five years in prison			0
but wildlife officials said putting two men in jail would be unlikely to stop the slaughter			0
' there 's a demand for food for the human population and there 's the greed for making money from palm oil , ' said a wildlife official in @entity106			0
' the result is diminishing habitat for the orang - utans and the death of these wonderful animals who are becoming desperate for food themselves			2
' police said they were considering the arrest of the supervisors who sent the men out on their slaughter missions			0
@entity9 is home to 90 per cent of the 50,000 orang - utans left in the wild			1
in the past 50 years , as the demand for palm oil , timber and vegetables has grown , @entity9 has lost half of its rain forests .			0
