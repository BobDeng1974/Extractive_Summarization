@entity0 will dig their heels in to prevent unhappy @entity2 from plunging the club into a major striker crisis this month			1
@entity5 has been told by senior sources at the club that despite their anger with the @entity10 ’s apparent agitations for a move , they are forced by sheer necessity to keep the 29 - year - old , who is @entity0 ’s only senior striker in the wake of @entity17 ’s exit			1
however , that marriage of convenience does not remove any of the ill - feeling caused on sunday when @entity2 used a television interview in @entity10 to indicate promises of playing time had been broken			1
he also said he planned discussions with his representatives to ‘ find the best solution ’			0
@entity2 ’s remarks have been noted by @entity48 , who are actively keen , while his camp have also claimed that @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 are interested			1
the @entity56 club would have to pay @entity2 the rest of his £ 8m signing - on fee as part of his transfer from @entity61 but @entity0 insist there will be no move , and even in the unlikely event that they are able to sign a senior striker before the transfer window closes , there would still be major obstacles to offloading @entity2			1
namely , @entity0 are obligated to pay him the remainder of his £ 8m signing - on fee agreed as part of his @entity73 transfer from @entity61 last summer			2
the huge sum is to be spread across his four - year , £ 55,000 - a - week contract , with £ 1m of the signing fee believed to have already been paid			2
he is due the balance of that fee regardless of whether he leaves now or later , though there would likely be a settlement in the event that an acceptable offer came from a rival club			2
the @entity10 claims that @entity0 broke their promise of an agreed amount of playing time @entity2 , who has scored only once in 18 @entity32 appearances , of which only six have been starts , told @entity93 at the weekend : ‘ when @entity17 was here , it was planned i should play a certain number of games			1
that was n't the case			0
today , i ask myself many questions			0
i need time to think			0
‘ i have been approached by clubs			0
i do n't know what will happen			0
me leaving ? it is possible			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , have agreed a fee worth close to £ 5m for @entity106 full - back @entity104 .			2
