by @entity0 the taxman is seeking official permission to break the speed limit like the emergency services under a new initiative launched by ministers			1
@entity7 ( @entity7 ) wants to join the police , fire , and ambulance and ‘ life - saving ’ 999 crews who have a special exemption from obeying the speed limit			1
breaking the limit : @entity7 are among the organisations calling for an exemption on speed limits life savers : at present only the emergency services are afforded the right to break the speed limit the proposals , now out for consultation , examine the possibility of extending speed limit exemptions to other services apart from police , fire and ambulance			1
these would include those carrying organs for transplant , bomb disposal units , the blood transfusion service , mountain and mine rescue , radiation emergencies , coastguard and @entity38 lifeboat launching services			1
but nestling in the small print of a 90 page consultation document published by the @entity46 – and conspicuous by its absence in an accompanying press release - the report notes : ‘ @entity7 are seeking exemptions from speed limits for its covert surveillance vehicles			1
’ it adds : ‘ @entity54 surveillance operations mirror the activities of the police service and they have extensive arrest and investigatory powers			1
’ legalising : although @entity59 , seen her in an @entity61 , may be used to high speed car chases the security services are only just asking to be exempt from speed restrictions the @entity65 raised an eyebrow at the inclusion of the taxman seeking permission to speed so close to the chancellor @entity71 ’s autumn statement on december 5 when he is under pressure to ditch a planned 3p a litre tax rise			1
an @entity65 spokesman said : ‘ it is surprising			0
but if the taxman is racing around above the speed - limit , he or she will quickly feel the pain of rising pump prices already felt by 33 million motorists			0
’ but the consultation paper notes : ‘ @entity7 are involved in covert surveillance of major organised crime			1
‘ nationally there are approximately 10 concurrent operational deployments per day involving 500 officers from the criminal @entity90			0
’ difference between life and death : road safety minister @entity93 said it is about time they started top look at exemptions for other services the @entity46 consultation will also look at amending road safety legislation so that emergency drivers would be required by law to complete high - speed training before exceeding the limit			1
but this will not place any additional burden on police , fire and ambulance services which already run an effective voluntary training scheme , it said			2
@entity7 officers are given ‘ blue light ’ training , but not speed training , it added			2
those used to seeing @entity59 thrashing his @entity61 in high speed chases on the big screen may be intrigued to learn of the intention to also bring the @entity63 under the umbrella of exemptions			0
the report notes : ‘ due to the sensitive nature of the covert operations , public information is limited			2
however , the @entity46 is content that the internal procedures set out by the services are of the highest standard			2
’ meanwhile , @entity131 units currently respond to 3,500 call outs a year of which 30 per cent are explosive devices			0
road safety minister @entity93 said : ‘ police , fire and ambulance service drivers are highly trained individuals who are at times required to exceed the speed limit in order to save lives			0
‘ it is only right that we look at allowing other services whose duties can mean the difference between life and death to exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies			0
‘ it is also time to look at the legal requirements of emergency vehicle training so we can build on the rigorous standards the police , fire and ambulance services have already applied through their code of practice			0
’ ‘ while emergency service drivers are not exempt from the offences of dangerous and careless driving , the current legislation allows drivers in some circumstances to break speed limits legally as well as exempting them from certain traffic regulations			0
the consultation closes on february 27 , 2013 .			0
