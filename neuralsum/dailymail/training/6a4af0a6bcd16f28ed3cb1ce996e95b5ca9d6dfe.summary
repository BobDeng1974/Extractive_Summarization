a graphic designer was left paralysed from the neck down and fighting for his life after catching a common cold			1
@entity4 , 41 , has spent the past seven months in hospital after developing the rare nerve condition @entity8 syndrome			1
the illness , which only affects one in two million people , attacks the body 's peripheral nervous system after a viral or bacterial infection such as the common cold			1
graphic designer @entity4 , 41 , has been left paralysed in hospital for seven months after developing the rare nerve condition @entity8 syndrome the paralysis was caused by his body overreacting to a common cold , and then attacking the nervous system			1
mr @entity4 has recently managed to take his first few steps he has only recently taken his first steps and has set his sights on being back home in @entity24 by the end of the year			1
mr @entity4 said : ' this year has been a write - off for me			1
' i came into hospital and it was winter time and i 'll leave in winter time			2
' he came down with a severe cold last @entity34 and was unable to shake it off for months			1
but after playing in a local football match in march , he woke the following day unable to move his legs			1
when he arrived at @entity39 for emergency treatment , doctors were initially baffled			0
he had the symptoms of a severe stroke , but his heart was fine			0
within days he had lost control of his arms , was struggling to breathe and was transferred to intensive care , where his condition worsened until he was almost totally paralysed			1
it was then that specialists realised he had @entity8 syndrome , a rare condition where the body 's immune system attacks the nervous system			1
the nerves become inflamed and stop working , which can lead to pain , tingling , muscle weakness , unsteadiness and lack of co-ordination			0
@entity8 ( pronounced @entity62 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
it affects about 1,500 people in the @entity70 every year and is slightly more common in men than women			2
it causes the immune system ( the body 's natural defence against infection and illness ) to attack these nerves , causing them to become inflamed			1
the exact cause of @entity8 is unknown , but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection			1
the symptoms of @entity8 usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection			1
they often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs			2
initially a person suffering the condition may experience : - pain , tingling and numbness - progressive muscle weakness - co-ordination problems and unsteadiness weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days			1
around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage			2
source : @entity110 in rare cases such as mr @entity112 , the muscle weakness can lead to paralysis as well as difficulty breathing and speaking			2
mr @entity4 said : ' i had a cold last @entity34 and i could n't shake it			1
' eventually my runny nose stopped , but i kept on coughing			2
i started to feel really tired every single day and could n't place why			0
' i thought i maybe just needed a good weekend to catch up on my sleep			0
' on the sunday morning it started i woke up and felt like i had a dead leg			0
' it was bizarre , but i did n't think anything of it			0
' he went to his football team 's match and pulled on his kit and played , despite feeling under the weather			1
the next day he woke up paralysed			0
he said : ' on the monday morning i woke up and both my legs were just gone			2
' on the tuesday morning when i woke , i could n't get out of bed			2
i could n't move my arms , i could n't eat			1
' doctors told me i would get worse before i got better , but by mid-afternoon , i was struggling to breathe and i was hiked up to intensive care			0
' about 80 per cent of people who contract @entity8 syndrome do recover , but the process can take anywhere between several weeks and a year			1
mrs @entity140 said : ' the first week or two i was saying " why has it happened to me ? "			0
' then it was a case of saying " it has happened to me and i 'll fight it "			0
' i 'm quite determined - in this situation , you have to be			0
if you feel sorry for yourself you 'll never get out of it			0
' now i can walk , i can feed myself			0
every day i 'm getting stronger and stronger			0
' however , the die - hard @entity149 fan fears he will never play his beloved sport again			0
but despite battling with the condition - he has made it to every game home game the team play at @entity155 in @entity24			2
he said : ' i hope that everything heals to a point where i can live my life as normal and find a way to adapt , and lead a regular life , go to work monday to friday , and have a beer at the weekend			0
' there 's no reason why i should n't be able to do that in time			2
my friends and family have kept me going			0
' seven months later , he said : ' now i can walk , i can feed myself			0
every day i 'm getting stronger and stronger '			0

@entity4 , 41 , went to play football despite not feeling well
a few days later he woke up and could n't move his legs
*rushed* to hospital where he found moving his arms or breathing difficult
was eventually *diagnosed* with rare nerve condition @entity8 syndrome
this causes the body 's immune system to attack it 's own nervous system
usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection like a common cold
seven months on , he has just managed to take his first steps
