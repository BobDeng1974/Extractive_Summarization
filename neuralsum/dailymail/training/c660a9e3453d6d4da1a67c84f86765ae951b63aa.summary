by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 05:32 est , 28 september 2012 he is already the @entity2 ’s highest paid star			0
now @entity3 is set for a £ 5million windfall after @entity5 bought out his stake in his production company			1
the @entity9 presenter set up @entity10 6 five years ago with the show ’s executive producer , @entity11 , to exploit the programme ’s global brand			1
together the pair owned half the firm , while @entity17 owned the other half			0
but now @entity3 and @entity11 have given the @entity2 full control			2
the money will come from the @entity2 ’s commercial division			0
the production company set up by @entity3 and @entity9 executive @entity11 , right , was formed for next to nothing in october 2006 and has now made them millions			1
the pair went to the same prestigious private school in @entity37 , @entity38 , where they were two years apart , before working together on various tv projects including @entity9			1
@entity10 6 was later bought into by @entity17 in 2007 , purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company			0
its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago , where it made a £ 1.8million post-tax profit and paid out £ 700,000 to its shareholders			2
and now the @entity2 has bought @entity3 out - making him £ 5million			1
there is speculation about where the name @entity10 6 comes from , and it is believed it is a pun on ' better sex ' - a reference to an in - joke about one of the dormitories at @entity11 and @entity3 's former school			2
@entity63 separately , @entity3 is believed to be paid a £ 500,000 talent fee by the @entity2 from the licence fee , which will remain fixed if the show continues until 2015			1
in addition , @entity3 has signed a new deal with the corporation that will see him present @entity9 for another three years			1
@entity10 6 has had huge success making money out of @entity9 merchandise , show tours , dvds and international sales rights			2
a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ @entity17 has agreed new commercial deals with @entity3 , @entity25 , @entity23 and @entity11 to secure @entity9 ’s international future for another three years			1
' this agreement secures the commercial future of @entity9 without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world and return profits to the @entity2			1
’ he caused controversy when it emerged that he earned £ 3 million in the year to march because of his stake in @entity90 , as the company made pre-tax profits of £ 15.2 million and is estimated to be worth more than £ 50 million			1
it has had huge success making money out of merchandise , show tours , dvds and international exploitation of the show			0
but @entity3 and @entity11 , who have been friends since their schooldays , resigned earlier this month , and @entity17 now have total ownership of the company			2
showstopper : it has also been revealed @entity3 has signed up to present @entity9 for the next three years publicly the corporation is saying it can not say how much the pair have paid for their stakes , but insiders say it is below £ 10 million			1
@entity3 will still get a share of @entity9 commercial revenue generated by the show , in return for promoting the show worldwide			1
his fellow presenters also signed a three - year deal with @entity17 , suggesting that they will continue to work on the show until 2015 , and will also receive money from commercial activities , in addition to the talent fee			1
the money will be paid to them directly rather than through a private company			0
@entity3 and @entity11 ’s windfalls because of @entity9 ’s success have left many at the @entity2 uncomfortable as the organisation attempts to make cutbacks			1
by @entity63 @entity9 's success has a lot to do with @entity3 's efforts as a presenter and writer			1
but there have been plenty of problems along the way , and @entity3 has often been at the centre of the controversy			2
in november 2008 he decided to make a joke about changing gear in a lorry and how tough a job it is - and linked it to the @entity146 @entity145 - who murdered several sex workers in @entity148			0
complaining @entity3 said ( pictured right and video below ) : ' change gear , change gear , change gear , check mirror , murder a prostitute , change gear , change gear , murder			0
that ’s a lot of effort in a day			0
' in february 2009 , @entity3 famously called then - prime minister @entity158 a ' one - eyed @entity160 idiot '			2
a year later he made a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red g - string to illustrate dangerous driving conditions , which was branded ' distasteful '			0
spin doctor @entity166 revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment @entity3 was asked by him about gay rights and he replied ' i demand the right not to be bummed			0
' in other gaffes he compared a @entity173 to a person with special needs , called @entity176 ' lazy ' , ' feckless ' and ' flatulent ' , said long queues at airport control could be solved by ' a bit of racism ' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints as a result			0
earlier this year he compared a @entity188 car to the @entity189 and people with ' growths on their faces '			0
but probably his most controversial moment came as he appeared on the one show , where he said that striking public sector workers ' should be shot in front of their families ' ( video below )			0
@entity3 was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark , made on @entity194 , sparked around 31,700 complaints			0
but he was later cleared .			0

@entity204 sold his portion of @entity90 production company to corporation
he set it up with @entity9 producer to exploit global brand
meanwhile @entity3 also signs up to three more years presenting the show with colleagues @entity25 and @entity23
he will receive £ 500,000 ' talent fee ' *funded* by the @entity218 licence - payer
