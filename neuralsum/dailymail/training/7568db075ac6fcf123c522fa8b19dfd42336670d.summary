men who drink at least two cups of tea a day could slash their risk of prostate cancer by more than a third , according to new research			1
regular tea drinkers were 37 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who drank it less than once a week			1
but there was no benefit from coffee , according to scientists at @entity15 in the @entity16 , where the latest study was carried out			1
regular tea drinkers were 37 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who drank it less than once a week nearly 40,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year in the @entity23 and 10,000 men die from it - the equivalent of more than one an hour			1
the risks increase with age , with men over 50 more likely to develop a tumour , and there is a strong genetic element to it			0
as with some other types of cancer , diet is thought to be a key factor in the development of the disease			0
but there has been conflicting evidence on the role of popular beverages			0
last year , for example , a study at @entity45 found heavy tea drinkers were more at risk of the disease			2
the study showed that drinking coffee had no benefits in preventing prostate cancer it tracked the health of more than 6,000 male volunteers over a period of 37 years and found those consuming over seven cups a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of prostate cancer than moderate and non tea drinkers			1
but the researchers stressed they could not be sure if tea really was a risk factor , or if drinkers lived to ages where cancer was more common			0
in the latest study , the @entity15 team compared 892 men diagnosed with prostate cancer with a similar number who were in good health , studying their dietary and drinking habits			1
the study was carried out on a population of men in the @entity80 , where coffee is much more popular			0
only one in five volunteers drank at least one tea a day , compared with nearly 60 per cent when it came to coffee			0
but the results , published in the journal @entity88 , showed two or more teas a day appeared to have a powerful anti-cancer effect , while coffee had none			0
the study did not examine how tea might help to prevent prostate tumours but previous investigations have found it contains disease - fighting chemicals , called polyphenols , that may protect vital tissues and organs against an invasion of cancerous cells			2
a 2010 study discovered women drinking just one cup of tea a day were ten per cent less likely to suffer ovarian cancer			2
in a report on the latest findings researchers said : ' this is further evidence that tea consumption may be a modifiable exposure that reduces the risk of prostate cancer			2
