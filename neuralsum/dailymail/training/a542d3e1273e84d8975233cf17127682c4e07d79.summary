a huge debate has erupted over how @entity2 stars will prepare for crucial knock - out matches now that @entity4 has started			1
many of the biggest names in the tournament are devout @entity8 - including @entity10 's @entity9 , and @entity11 , @entity13 's @entity12 , @entity15 's @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity17 , eight @entity19 stars including @entity20 , and the entire @entity22 side			1
@entity4 requires @entity8 to forgo all food and liquid during daylight hours - something experts warn could hamper performance at the best of times , but could potentially be dangerous as players push their body to the limit in the @entity32 heat while battling it out for football 's greatest prize			1
it is not known whether @entity45 ( left ) will be fasting , but @entity12 ( right ) has already said he will be eating and drinking as usual during @entity4 speculation over which players are observing @entity4 - which began yesterday - is raging in countries with a number of @entity2 stars , particularly in @entity10 , @entity19 and @entity15			1
it is the first time a @entity43 has overlapped with @entity4 for 28 years			1
perhaps unsurprisingly the debate is at its most fervent in @entity22 - the only @entity2 - majority country still playing in the tournament			0
this morning the team 's @entity55 manager @entity54 accused the media of a ' lack of respect and ethics ' for repeatedly asking which players would be fasting during @entity4			2
a muslim himself , @entity54 said : ' @entity4 is here and i read in some @entity22 newspapers criticisms about me , about my image , about my honour ... this is really disgusting			2
' ' those who continue criticising our team and my actions , i think it 's shameful , ' he added , before threatening to walk out of the press conference if he was asked any more questions about @entity4			0
although @entity54 insisted each player was entirely free to make his own decision , a number of prominent clerics in @entity22 have demanded they observe @entity4 while playing			1
several of the more prominent @entity2 footballers still involved in the tournament are yet to make a comment on whether or not they will be observing @entity4			0
other than @entity22 , the remaining team with the most @entity2 players is @entity19			0
@entity89 ( left ) converted to @entity90 in 2012 , while @entity20 ( right ) was born into a @entity2 family in the former @entity92 although he is often seen praying before matches , @entity10 's @entity11 ( left ) has kept quiet on whether he will observe @entity4			1
his teammate @entity94 ( right ) has said he will not be fasting , however while @entity4 is one of the five pillars of @entity90 , individuals who are travelling or going to war can be exempted from fasting			0
those players that choose not to observe @entity4 will most likely be doing so under this provision			2
from the @entity10 side , neither @entity9 , @entity102 or @entity11 have made a public statement on the subject and their intention remains unclear			2
@entity94 , meanwhile , has revealed he wo n't be taking part , saying : ' i know that as a @entity2 there are certain ... ' laws ' , which are not allowed to be avoided , but personally , i ’m not going to do it			0
' ' everyone ’s free to as they like , i completely respect those who are going to practice it … i do n’t think it poses any problem , he added			0
' but , you have to be ready and take responsibility for it … and to be careful not to have any deficiencies , to avoid injuries , because at this level , you do n’t get away with mistakes , ' he went on			0
however @entity125 star @entity124 has made statements in previous years saying he always observes @entity4 no matter what he is doing , so it seems likely he will among those fasting			2
questions : the @entity15 side could also be hit by several players fasting , including @entity14 ( left ) , @entity16 and @entity17 ( right )			0
none of these players have yet revealed their plans however big names : @entity19 's @entity137 ( right ) and @entity138 ( left ) , and @entity10 's @entity9 ( centre ) are among the well - known @entity2 stars currently impressing at the @entity43 in @entity141 the @entity15 side could also be hit by several players fasting , including @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity17 - although , again , none of these players have publicly revealed their plans			1
@entity145 , on the other hand , has refused to observe the fasting saying he can not risk ' losing power ' by not fuelling himself efficiently for matches in such challenging conditions			0
@entity13 and @entity151 also have several @entity2 players , but while the @entity153 - including @entity12 and @entity154 - dismissed the idea of observing @entity4 , the @entity157 @entity156 and @entity158 are expected to take part			1
other than @entity22 , the team with the most @entity2 players remaining in the @entity43 is @entity19 , which has a large @entity90 population due to asylum seekers the @entity165 states			1
among the @entity2 stars are @entity167 's @entity20 - who has been one of the tournament 's best performers - @entity169 trio @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity172 , as well as @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			0
the majority of these stars are not expected to observe @entity4 , although one @entity19 player who might is @entity179 man @entity89 who converted is @entity90 in 2012 and likely to be more observant as a result .			2

many of the biggest names still playing in the @entity43 are @entity8
for the first time in 28 years , @entity4 and the @entity43 overlap
