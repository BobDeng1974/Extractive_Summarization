the murder of @entity1 , pictured , who died alongside three other @entity4 embassy officials , can not be written off as an isolated incident the murder of @entity1 is as shocking as it is unprecedented in recent times			1
the last assassination of an @entity4 ambassador was in @entity10 , more than three decades ago			1
however , the killing of mr @entity1 , who died alongside three other @entity4 embassy officials , can not be written off as an isolated incident			1
rather , it marks an opening salvo by radical groups in @entity16 who are now poised , with deadly determination , to launch a @entity20 wave of revolution in the name of @entity24 fundamentalism			1
similar groups across the @entity26 will follow their lead			0
it is no coincidence the attack took place on the anniversary of september 11 , for these groups are fiercely hostile to @entity4 and the @entity34			1
from @entity36 to @entity37 , @entity38 to @entity39 , the emergent extremists have one clear goal : the toppling of the nascent regimes that came to power after last year ’s uprisings			0
their wish is to impose the strictest form of @entity24 on society , and espouse hostile views against what they see as the decadent @entity34			1
such groups believe the new regimes are led by @entity53 stooges or secular elites			0
and it is not just @entity4 these extremists loathe			2
while the relatively moderate @entity57 which swept to power in @entity38 wishes to maintain a long - standing peace treaty with @entity60 , these @entity63 - inspired terror groups dream of wiping the jewish state off the map			0
so this week ’s @entity4 deaths are the latest power play in a region - wide struggle – one in which @entity70 involved itself this week when it sent the head of @entity73 to encourage the @entity60 not to attack @entity74			1
blame for the attack on the @entity4 consulate has been laid at the door of an ultra-conservative @entity79 group , @entity78 ( supporters of @entity81 )			1
it is n’t their first violent foray			0
the group have also been responsible for imposing the segregation of the sexes in public , setting up torture chambers and beating up anyone caught with alcohol			0
in june , a vehicle containing the @entity70 ambassador to @entity16 was attacked by rocket - propelled grenades , and the @entity4 @entity94 in @entity95 was also bombed			1
the group says the attacks were motivated by assassinations of suspected @entity63 members in @entity99 by unmanned @entity4 drones			2
self - evidently , nearly a year after the fall of @entity102 , @entity16 is anything but stable			2
but it rules only in name			0
@entity16 ’s still lawless streets have been overrun by a hodge - podge of @entity79 and tribal militias			2
they refuse to recognise the @entity112 ’s authority , and have assassinated numerous @entity16 government officials during recent months			2
spark for the attack on the @entity4 consulate , though , was not disaffection with the government , but the release online of clips from the film @entity132 which attacks the @entity134 as a paedohile and philanderer			1
offensive , insulting and childish , it may have been intended to help @entity60 by exposing the threat of @entity24			0
but it is only serving to threaten @entity60 ’s immediate security			0
the nation ’s position in the @entity26 is precarious , and the @entity143 has presented the country with a number of new challenges because it ’s security is closely tied to that of @entity16 and @entity39			2
the @entity4 flag stood at half - staff at the @entity4 @entity151 yesterday in respect of @entity1 and three other officials who were murdered damage : the wreckage at the @entity4 consulate , one day after armed men stormed the place @entity39 has long provided a conduit for @entity74 to provide aid and weapons to its proxy @entity161 in @entity162 , and has offered a safe haven for the @entity165 leadership			1
both @entity161 and @entity165 are @entity74 - backed enemies of @entity60			0
if the @entity169 regime in @entity39 does fall , many in the @entity34 imagine that @entity74 will be left isolated and vulnerable , and @entity60 ’s established enemies therefore weakened			2
however , quite the reverse may happen			0
there is every chance that the @entity169 regime would be replaced ( as in @entity16 ) by a @entity53 - backed interim government of ‘ moderate ’ @entity79 groups and former regime defectors			1
such a government would n’t last long			0
foreign jihadists have been flooding into the country			0
once @entity169 is overthrown , they will jump at the chance to seize power and turn their firepower on @entity60			0
@entity60 may then find itself confronting an even more determined , uncontrollable and fanatical enemy than any of the @entity187 regimes ever proved to be			0
the attack on the @entity4 consulate in @entity109 offers a chilling sign of what lies ahead , not just in @entity16 , but across the region			1
burnt : the attack of the compound , pictured , took place on september 11 , the anniversary of the @entity198 @entity199 , debris and overturned furniture are strewn inside a room in the gutted @entity4 consulate so what can we conclude from these troubling developments ? primarily , that the @entity34 has learned nothing from its experience in @entity10 and @entity209			1
in @entity16 and @entity39 , @entity53 governments have backed radical @entity79 groups , and by doing so have failed to understand that loyalty bought rather than earned is a recipe for disaster			1
for while the @entity24 are initially eager to take arms and funding from the @entity34 , they prove still more eager to turn and use those weapons against their former paymasters and while the @entity221 jihadists in @entity16 and @entity39 are no friends of @entity222 - dominated @entity74 , their long - term desire to see the destruction of @entity60 and its @entity4 allies transcends such regional rivalries			1
attacks by @entity24 last month along @entity60 ’s border with @entity38 , the most brazen in decades , show that the danger posed by jihadists is not an intangible fear but a current – and growing – problem			0
the storming of the @entity4 consulate in @entity16 , moreover , coincided with a similar storming of the @entity4 embassy in @entity237			1
@entity1 , right , attends meetings in @entity109 , @entity16 last year this shows yet again that , while the @entity57 - led @entity38 government may be @entity242 , the @entity38 masses are not			2
they remain as anti-israel as ever			0
an @entity60 attack on @entity74 , or a @entity4 bombing of the country at @entity60 ’s behest , will galvanise the @entity249 world as never before			1
it will provide the perfect opportunity for radicals to launch a counter-revolution against ‘ moderate ’ regimes			0
it has been said time and time again that the first wave of @entity143 revolutions were started by the self - immolation of a @entity36 street seller			0
could @entity262 ’s ill - conceived film about the prophet @entity134 similarly prove the catalyst that brings the most formidable enemies of @entity60 and the @entity34 to power ? @entity267 is the author of after the @entity143 : how @entity24 hijacked the @entity268 ( @entity269 )			2

no coincidence attack took place on anniversary of september 11
