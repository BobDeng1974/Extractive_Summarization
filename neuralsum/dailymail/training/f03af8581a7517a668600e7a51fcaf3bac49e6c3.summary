by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it 's perhaps no surprise that @entity3 wants to have his cake and eat it when the man pulling the strings is his long - time representative and mentor @entity7			1
those who have become used to @entity7 ’s bizarre utterances over the years will not have been shocked by the latest outburst in which he accused @entity12 of snubbing his famous client ’s 31st birthday			1
the @entity17 club @entity16 once bought @entity19 defender @entity18 a £ 800,000 @entity21 car , he noted			0
all @entity3 got was two birthday cakes			2
influential : agent @entity7 is the man driving @entity3 's latest outburst at @entity12 @entity25 : @entity3 stands proudly with manager @entity26 after sealing the @entity28 title return ? @entity7 engineered @entity3 's move from @entity30 but the midfielder is keen on a return to the @entity33 @entity34 and @entity35 , @entity12 ’s director of football and chief executive , have certainly seen it all before during their time at @entity30 when @entity7 was forever sniping over the club ’s reluctance to give @entity3 a better deal or more playing time			1
then coach @entity43 became so exasperated by @entity7 ’s verbal incontinence that he confronted the player and demanded to know how he could respect @entity3 when his agent spoke without restraint so frequently			1
the issue is understood to have convinced @entity30 to sell @entity49 months before he joined @entity12 for £ 24million			2
even then , @entity7 hardly helped the deal to go through			0
‘ @entity12 talk a lot , but when they put their offer in writing , they do n’t look like a rich club , but a bankrupt one , ’ he said			2
after @entity3 helped his new club win the @entity28 title in 2012 , @entity7 claimed that he might have to leave because he needed ‘ new motivations ’			1
last year he got the @entity60 star a lucrative new deal after they claimed there were too few shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop			0
so who is the eccentric @entity71 agent who has forged such a strong bond with @entity3 over the years that the player named his second child after him ? a picture of @entity7 on his @entity77 page shows the agent relaxing in @entity79 , where he is now based , in front of a billboard for @entity82 , an exclusive brand of @entity85 wristwatches and jewellery			1
it is a fitting image			0
close : @entity3 named his second child after his agent @entity7 after the pair became good friends sliding in : despite the outburst , @entity3 is paid handsomely by @entity12 , north of £ 200,000 - a - week fast car : @entity7 noted that @entity18 was bought a @entity21 by @entity17 club @entity16 on his birthday ‘ i like my players more than i like money , ’ @entity7 said recently , but he has certainly become a rich man off @entity3 ’s success and stands to make even more if he can engineer one more big transfer before @entity3 retires			1
they first got together when @entity3 left @entity60 to join @entity101 club @entity100 in 2001			1
such was @entity7 ’s hold over the player that @entity3 ignored advice from his own brother @entity105 to join @entity71 team @entity106			1
from there it was on to @entity109 , @entity79 and then @entity30			0
‘ @entity3 trusts me 100 per cent , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ when he was young , i put him in more difficult situations so he had to grow and have a stronger personality			0
that paid off for him			0
’ and for @entity7 as well			0
‘ this guy says one thing one day and another thing on the other , ’ @entity3 once remarked			0
@entity12 just wish he would say nothing at all .			0

@entity7 has been @entity3 's representative since 2001
the @entity71 has a *reputation* for *complaining* on *behalf* of toure
@entity3 is upset that @entity12 showed him a lack of respect when it came to *celebrating* his 31st birthday
the player is believed to want to retire at former club @entity30
@entity7 says the @entity131 *giants* cared for the @entity60
