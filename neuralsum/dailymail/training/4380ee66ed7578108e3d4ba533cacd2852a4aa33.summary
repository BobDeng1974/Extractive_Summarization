@entity0 has told @entity1 he is ready to play a full part in @entity4 's fight for @entity6 survival as soon as the @entity4 boss needs him			1
the striker 's 20 goals were crucial in @entity4 's unexpected promotion from the @entity12 last season but he missed the final few weeks after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in march			1
@entity0 finally made his comeback as a late substitute in @entity4 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity17 on @entity18 , earning a rousing reception both when his name was read out before the game and when he came on			1
@entity0 made his return from injury as a second - half substitute against @entity17 on @entity18 the 25 - year - old has shown in the development games he played in to build up his fitness that he has not lost his eye for goal and , with @entity4 having scored only 12 goals in 18 @entity6 matches , there is no doubt he has been missed			1
@entity1 does not feel he is quite ready to start yet and he will almost certainly be among the substitutes again when the @entity4 visit @entity34 on sunday			1
@entity0 said : ' it was great to be back			1
it was obviously a tough one to take with the result , going on how we played , but on a personal note it 's nice to be back out on the pitch			2
' i 've been itching to get back			0
it 's been a long - term plan and it 's coming together nicely			1
i got told to aim for the new year so nine months ago i 'd probably have taken this			0
@entity47 celebrates on the pitch while on crutches last season after injuring his cruciate knee ligaments in march ' i 've got three or four 90 minutes under my belt now in the reserves and that 's a big thing for me			1
whenever the gaffer calls upon me , i 'm ready			2
' the @entity57 international accepts , though , that he may have to bide his time even when @entity1 does deem him ready			1
@entity59 has established himself as @entity61 ' strike partner and scored winning goals against @entity63 and @entity64 while @entity65 and @entity66 are also on the books			0
' there 's a lot of competition and that 's only good for the club , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity73 came in and has done fantastically , got a couple of great goals , and match - winning goals as well			2
it 's important we keep that competition and everyone fighting for a place			2
' @entity0 scored 20 goals in the @entity12 last season before his injury as @entity4 earned promotion @entity0 and @entity61 were the most effective forward pairing in the @entity12 last season and @entity61 has already shown he can be a big danger at @entity6 level			1
' i 'm not surprised at all , ' said @entity0			2
' we all saw it last year and over the last few years			0
he 's kicked on another level this year			0
it 's good to get back alongside him			0
' the @entity17 defeat saw @entity4 drop to 19th in the table but there was plenty of room for optimism after a first - half performance @entity103 rated as the best of his time at the club			1
@entity61 hit the post and @entity4 dominated possession and chances only to be caught out by a @entity113 break in the 62nd minute			2
@entity61 hit the post with this strike during the defeat by @entity17 on @entity18 @entity0 has seen his team - mates grow into the challenge after a difficult start but knows good performances are not enough			1
he said : ' the lads have definitely come on			0
the first 10 games was obviously getting used to it but we definitely look like we deserve to be here now			0
we 're not getting turned over in games			0
' it was always going to be tough but , if we look at performances like ( @entity17 ) , we came up against a strong @entity17 side and held our own for most of the game			2
it 's just important that we come out of games like this with points now			0
' the challenges do not get any easier , with second - placed @entity34 looking to make it 10 wins in a row on sunday			0
@entity59 tussles for possession with @entity17 's @entity138 during the @entity140 loss @entity1 is hoping @entity4 's underdog status can help them , saying : ' you have freedom in those games			1
' that does n't guarantee you a result , they 're fantastic			0
they could change the whole team and still be very powerful at this level			0
' but we know the expectation is totally on them , as it was with @entity17			2
it means the players can go and play			0
we believe in what we 're doing , that 's quite obvious			0
