by @entity1 reporter published : 20:58 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 09:38 est , 10 october 2012 satellite images have uncovered the building where @entity4 practiced the mission to kill @entity6 - and the similarities of that structure to the actual compound in @entity10 , @entity11 , is shocking			1
the training facility was constructed on @entity14 soil to prepare members of @entity16 for what was to be a daunting mission that resulted in @entity6 's death last year			1
but the details of the training facility , including its location , were never released - until now			1
when compared with satellite images of the actual bin laden compound in @entity10 , @entity11 , the two structures - though thousands of miles away - look remarkably similar			1
so how did @entity33 â€™s mapwatchers know where to look ? they needed only to peek into the pages of @entity47 , the first - hand account of the @entity6 raid by one of the @entity16 members who was there			2
when looking at the same area in @entity36 on @entity53 , however , there is no trace of the building , which was apparently demolished - just like its @entity11 twin - after the mission			2
gone : the bin laden compound was demolished shortly after the @entity16 raid that led to the terror leader 's demise what facility ? the training compound can be seen similarly demolished after it served its purpose uncovered : @entity47 's @entity47 revealed that the @entity39 training facility was located somewhere in @entity36 no @entity47 was written by a soldier identifying himself as @entity67 , but was later outed as retired @entity16 seal @entity47			1
he claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed @entity6			0
@entity73 's book has proved controversial because @entity73 did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it			0
it also disagrees with the official @entity78 version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the @entity82 administration consternation			0
watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity6 's compound , the @entity84 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity82 mission : the @entity84 leader was killed at this compound in @entity10 by @entity93 tension : the raid of @entity6 's @entity10 compound was watched by president @entity82 and his closest advisers in the @entity98 of the @entity78 @entity6 was killed by the commandos who had orchestrated a late night raid on may 1 , 2011			1
a film about the operation , @entity102 - from @entity104 director @entity103 - is due to be released december 19			0
republicans chided the @entity78 earlier this year amid reports that @entity103 and screenwriter @entity107 - who both won @entity108 for @entity104 - were given unprecedented access to classified information			0
the @entity82 administration has denied those claims			0
location : the training compound was spotted in @entity40 , @entity36			2

location of training facility were kept *secret* , but it was revealed in @entity47 's @entity47 that it was located in @entity36
satellite map reveals a structure remarkably similar to @entity6 's compound in @entity10 , @entity11
training facility wound up being destroyed after the raid
