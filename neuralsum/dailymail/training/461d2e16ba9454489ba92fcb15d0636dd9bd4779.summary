valuable teeth have been stolen from some of the carcasses of the seven beached sperm whales that died on @entity4 in @entity5 , as authorities warn people of hefty fines if they go near the dead animals			1
locals believe that the whales washed ashore on sunday night while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out			1
the whales were found 50m offshore at @entity16 , about 4km south of @entity17			1
environmental department animal welfare manager dr. @entity19 told @entity21 , they had been sent photos of the jaw which show teeth missing , each believed to be worth hundreds of dollars			2
the @entity5 government reminded people who were thinking of going near the whales , they could cop a fine , with anyone that is seen to come within 50 metres of the mammal , facing a fine of up to $ 100,000			1
the reasons are to protect the safety of beach - goers with the corpses likely to attract sharks			0
the @entity50 ( @entity51 ) regulations state that a person who is on land must not move closer than 50 metres to a marine mammal , whether it is on land or in the water , if it shows signs of disturbance , appears to be sick or injured , is stranded , is entangled or is a calf or pup			1
@entity5 @entity62 manager @entity61 with standing in front of one of six sperm whales washed up dead in a rare mass stranding on the @entity5 coast when all the whales were found six were dead , with a seventh whale dying later on monday			1
a fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty			1
the whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the @entity77			1
the trained staff were able to coax the huge whale into deeper water and prevent another death			2
speaking to the @entity83 , @entity17 caravan park manager @entity82 said he smelt the whales before her saw them and revealed that some of them were splashing in the shallow water , desperately trying to reach deeper waters			2
' because they are so fresh , there 's no smell , but it wo n't be long until they get on the nose , i 'd say , ' he said			0
' there 's three that are about that size , and the other three are a fraction smaller , ' he said			0
' we talked to a lot of the locals and there 's been the odd sighting now and then on the sea , but this is very unusual , ' mr @entity82 said			2
locals believe that the whales washed ashore last night , while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out @entity77 regional co-ordinator @entity114 told @entity21 that the eighth whale was deeply distressed and was very close to breaching			1
' @entity117 staff and a @entity119 officer located a live seven - metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at @entity122 , ' regional co-ordinator he said			2
' the animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they have n't seen it since			0
they will remain in the area to confirm it does n't come into the shallows again			0
' experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble			0
one such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water , when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod			0
another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide			0
the whales were found 50m offshore at @entity16 , about 4km south of @entity17 dr @entity19 said she was distressed to see the whales on the beach			1
' this is rare , ' she said			0
' unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years			0
' @entity158 users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event @entity158 has been set alight byt the mass death of seven whales in @entity17 it is still uncertain when the whales will be removed from the beach			0
with each whale weighing up to 50 tonnes the task may take a while			2
the @entity77 is hoping that post-mortems on the whales will lead to an explanation			0
a witness at the scene told the @entity21 that the whales covered an area of about 500m			0
a fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty today.the whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the @entity77 the witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it 's tail this morning at 8am , but stopped a short while later			1
the @entity188 say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50 - 70 - years - old			1
they say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes , they are known to mass strand			1
