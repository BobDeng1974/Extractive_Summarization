the @entity1 protesters had another surprise visitor today when @entity5 - winning actress @entity4 came along to show her support			1
the 64 - year - old stopped by the @entity1 encampment in @entity9 on her way to @entity11 this afternoon			1
she told the crowd : ' i 'm just here to be educated and offer my support			2
there ’s a lot of different kinds of people here who want to shift the paradigm to something that ’s addressing the huge gap between the rich and the poor			2
i 'm here to support freedom of speech			2
it never changes from the top , it only changes from the bottom			2
' it helps to focus on one thing to be accomplished			0
is everyone here registered to vote ? are you having people sign petitions ? ' @entity4 is a veteran of protest marches and civil disobedience actions for liberal and humanitarian causes			1
she gave the younger generation of ralliers some pointers , suggesting that they focus on one issue			0
last night , left - wing author and documentary maker @entity61 made a surprise visit to protesters			1
a populist but controversial figure , it could only have been a coincidence that his new book , @entity69 , has just hit book stores			2
he joined campaigners at @entity9 , @entity74 , on the 10th day of protests that have seen nearly 100 arrests and just hours after markets in the @entity78 and across the globe had rallied			2
anti-capitalist : @entity61 made a surprise visit to @entity1 protesters last night where he said @entity78 have no say over how the economy is run saluting the flag : occupy @entity1 ' demonstrator @entity85 drew the stares in @entity74 's @entity87 last night @entity61 was especially welcomed by the protesters who are growing increasingly angry at an impressive array of things			1
first it was the greedy bankers , then the plunging markets , followed by the mortgage crisis and even the execution in @entity96 of convicted murderer @entity97			2
last night the arrival of @entity100 director @entity61 was topped only by one female protester stripping to her bare chest			1
outside @entity103 : mr @entity105 ' visit came on the 11th day of protests in @entity107 and after global markets made their strongest gains for two week anger : hundreds of people have joined the demonstration against bank bail outs , the @entity78 mortgage crisis and the execution of convicted murderer @entity97 his arrival followed the previous day 's surge by global markets , which made some of their biggest gains for two weeks			1
those rises continued again today with @entity124 markets rose up across the board - @entity126 's @entity125 closed up 204.68 at 5,294.05			1
the @entity129 industrial average followed the path , shooting up 257.86 points to 11,301.72 , thanks mainly to continuing house prices			1
the @entity134 rose 26.45 to 1,189.40			0
the @entity136 composite rose 54.05 to 2,570.74			0
@entity137 : mr @entity61 's appearance came days after he started promoting his new book , described by the @entity140 as ' a cabbage rather than a rose ' investors have been on edge about @entity124 's debt problems for months			1
the @entity129 plunged 6.4 per cent last week , its biggest drop since the week ended october 10 , 2008 at the height of the financial crisis			1
the market 's volatility has made many investors nervous			0
since the first week of august , the @entity129 has closed up or down more than 200 points a total of 16 times			1
there were only four swings of 200 points or more in the other seven months of 2011			0
however , the news of a multi-trillion dollar bailout package to help the defaulting @entity160 appears to have settled investors			0
but it has n't soothed the mood of mr @entity61 and his protesters			1
the anti-capitalist said : ' these [ protesters ] and the people across this country have no say in how our economic system is run			0
@entity171 destroyed my town , @entity174 , @entity175 , people have suffered as a result of the greed of corporations			0
' i have actually done pretty decent [ out of capitalism ] because people come see my movies , ' he told @entity184 , adding : ' i totally reject the system			0
a happy day for me is when i will be unemployed			0
' mr @entity61 recently started promoting his new book , @entity69 , which has been panned as being self - aggrandising with @entity140 describing it as ' a cabbage rather than a rose , a tangy ring of bologna rather than a sirloin			1
' and that 's one of the more favourable reviews			0
tools of capitalism : protesters in @entity9 , @entity74 , have taken to the internet and social networking sites to promote their cause and give live feeds @entity202 ? in some quarters the demonstrations have been compared to the uprisings of @entity206 no say : mr @entity61 said that protesters and people across @entity78 have no say in how the economic system is run the @entity210 suggested that even his most ardent fans would struggle to swallow the utter lack of immodesty in the tome			1
police were simply hoping that his presence did not cause any further trouble at @entity1			0
one police officer was allegedly injured during the protests by an @entity1 demonstrator over the weekend			0
on saturday some of the protesters took part in an unauthorised march which police allowed to pass peacefully			0
there was trouble , however , on saturday night when people were penned in behind yellow meshing and an used pepper spray on four women			0
no say : mr @entity61 said that protesters and people across @entity78 have no say in how the economic system is run trouble : at the weekend , however , police used mace on protesters penned in behind orange meshing which some have said was done without provocation			2

@entity4 stops by protest before *jetting* off to @entity11
@entity61 dropped in last time *...* coinciding with release of new book
@entity245 and @entity124 markets continue to bounce back with strong starts
@entity248 @entity125 up 4.02 **%** , @entity250 @entity249 up 4.69 **%**
biggest rise on @entity129 for two weeks raises *confidence*
