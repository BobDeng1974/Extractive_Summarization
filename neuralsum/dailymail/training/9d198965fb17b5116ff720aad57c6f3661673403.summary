by @entity1 reporter published : 08:04 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 19:50 est , 11 march 2014 shoppers across @entity4 may soon have to pay for plastic bags under planned @entity7 laws designed to reduce litter			1
@entity9 voted in favour of strict targets that would force each country to halve its use of the lightweight disposable bags by 2017 and to cut it by 80 per cent by 2019			2
the 28 member states will be allowed to decide themselves how to meet the target – but meps suggest they will either have to introduce a charge for the single - use carrier bags , tax shops which give them out for free , or impose a complete ban			0
@entity23 could soon be banned from taking their shopping home in plastic bags after the @entity17 approved @entity7 targets @entity28 ’s @entity27 yesterday backed a report by the @entity30 that would require each government to take some form of legislative action to curb free handouts of plastic bags			2
the average @entity7 citizen uses 198 plastic bags a year , the vast majority of which are single - use			1
critics of plastic bags argue they waste resources , contribute to litter , and represent a powerful symbol of the ' throwaway society ' , and last year the @entity30 put forward proposals to require member states to enact plastic bag bans , levies , or other measures to reduce their use			1
@entity17 have now approved the plans , which aim to halve plastic bag hand - outs over three years and then reduce use to 80 per cent of today ’s levels by the end of the decade			1
every year each @entity7 citizen uses , on average , 200 bags with 8billion of them ending up in seas and rivers under the new rules , which still have to be voted on by the full @entity28 and backed by the @entity66 , member states would have the option of introducing a small levy on plastic bags , as has already been successfully enacted in the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
alternatively , they could introduce mandatory plastic bag reduction targets			2
the legislation would also make it possible for governments to introduce an outright ban on plastic bags , without contravening single market rules			0
@entity82 is currently facing legal action from the @entity30 , after launching @entity4 ’s first plastic bag ban in 2011			2
but that case could be dropped if the new proposals get the green light			0
however , despite the @entity90 ’s overall support for the plan yesterday , conservative meps were strongly opposed to the idea			0
writing on @entity94 , mep @entity93 questioned if plastic bag use should be within the remit of the @entity7			1
it now remains to be seen whether the whole @entity28 will now approve the plans in april , when they are due to be discussed at a plenary session			0
green mep @entity100 had originally proposed a target to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent over two years , but the @entity106 , @entity104 and @entity105 group reached a compromise agreement to deliver on the target over five years , in the hope that it would be more likely to gain majority backing in the plenary vote			1
deputy prime minister @entity112 has already set a minimum 5p charge for plastic bags from 2015 in response to the @entity1 's @entity117 campaign @entity118 , @entity100 and environment spokesman for the party in @entity121 , accused the @entity122 of opposing action to tackle a serious environmental problem			0
' it is clear that we need an @entity7 - wide approach to prevent the enormous damage being done by plastic bag waste to @entity4 ’s seas and beaches , ' he said			1
' plastic bags not only blight our landscape , they pose a serious threat to marine wildlife			0
three - quarters of seabirds and one third of fish in the @entity140 have been found to be contaminated by plastic waste , much of it from plastic bags			0
by voting against these proposals , the @entity144 are sending out a clear signal that they do n’t care about preserving our marine environment for future generations			0
' however , if the proposals are approved , they are unlikely to have much impact on @entity23 policy as the government has already announced plans to introduce a five pence charge on single use carrier bags in @entity156 in 2015 , following similar legislation that was successfully introduced in @entity158 and @entity159			0
@entity160 is also planning to introduce a plastic bag ban in october this year .			1

new @entity7 target set to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent
each @entity7 citizen uses an average of 200 bags every year
they are kept for an average of 20 minutes but take *1,000* years to *degrade*
