second try : the @entity0 decided to again seek the death penalty for convicted cop killer @entity2 with a new jury rather than let the defendant serve an automatic life term convicted cop killer @entity2 , who fathered a baby with a former prison guard , is facing the prospect of capital punishment once again , but sentencing him to death will cost @entity12 taxpayers millions of dollars			1
the @entity0 , after learning that an appeals court threw out a death sentence for @entity2 in 2011 , decided to again seek the ultimate punishment with a new jury rather than let the defendant serve an automatic life term			1
court officials say since then , at least $ 1.6million in taxpayer money has gone to his defense - and the meter is still running			2
@entity2 has been convicted in the brutal slaying of two undercover police officers @entity26 and @entity27 on the night of march 10 , 2003			1
he was initially sentenced to death , making @entity2 the city 's first federal defendant to receive a death sentence since 1954 , when it was imposed on a bank robber who killed an @entity35 agent			1
but the appeals court reversed the decision , saying that prosecutors violated @entity2 's constitutional rights by telling the jury his decision to go to trial demonstrated his lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility			1
after @entity2 won his appeal , judge @entity47 cautioned lawyers he had just presided over a capital case for a mobster where the defense bill was $ 5million			1
it ended with the jury choosing to impose a life sentence			2
‘ if i 'm going to spend four months of my career and millions of dollars of taxpayers ' money trying another one of these death penalty cases , i need to know the attorney general wants to try it , ’ he said			0
new lease on life : an appeals court threw out a death sentence for @entity2 in 2011 , saying that prosecutors violated his constitutional rights questioning whether it was worth pursuing the @entity2 case made sense , given the city 's track record in federal death penalty case , said @entity73 , executive director of the nonprofit @entity74			1
‘ it 's hard in @entity12 to have a jury return a death sentence , ’ @entity73 said			1
‘ judges there often look at that and ask , ` why would you spend all this money ? ' ‘ it 's a boy : former prison guard @entity85 , who became pregnant with @entity2 's baby , gave birth to a son in march under similar circumstances , the @entity0 has decided not to retry the penalty phase of capital cases at least four times since the federal death penalty was established in 1988 , according to the nonprofit			1
but , without explanation , attorney general @entity95 authorized the @entity99 attorney 's office in @entity100 to move ahead			0
how much that decision will ultimately cost is unknown			0
a 2008 study found that the average cost of defending a federal death case is more than $ 620,000			0
by the time the appeals process plays out , that total typically tops $ 1million , @entity73 said			0
so far in the new proceedings , @entity2 's lawyers - who , by law , can be paid up to $ 178 an hour - have had him examined by several experts in a failed bid to have him declared ineligible for the death penalty because he 's mentally disabled			1
jury selection lasted five weeks			0
and the penalty phase is projected to take at least a @entity117 under the circumstances , the expense of the proceeding is worth it , said @entity120 , president of the @entity121			0
‘ this particular cop killing is one of the most egregious i 've ever seen , ’ the union official said			0
‘ there were two victims , and ( @entity2 ) knew exactly what he was doing			2
... i understand the concern about cost , but sometimes you must move forward with what is right			0
’ reckoning : @entity85 is expected to plead guilty to having sex with an inmate as part of a deal with the prosecution @entity2 ’s legal odyssey picked up again in @entity100 last week with the start of the repeat of penalty phase of his case , which so far is playing out in a mostly empty courtroom with grim - faced jurors listening to witnesses recounting the circumstances of the case by rote			2
‘ i asked , “ why did you do that ? ” ’ a cooperating accomplice , @entity150 , recalled about a conversation with @entity2 after the shootings			0
‘ he told me he did n't give a ( expletive ) about nobody			0
’ @entity2 - once a scrawny street gang member nicknamed @entity155 - appears in court these days wearing glasses and dress shirts appropriate for a college classroom			2
but the 31 - year - old often looks distant and disengaged , and away from court he 's demonstrated a cynical streak that defies his life - or - death predicament			1
in february , officials revealed that after being transferred from federal death row in @entity166 to a @entity100 lockup to await the proceedings , @entity2 fathered a child with jail guard @entity85 , who gave birth to a baby boy in march			2
slain : detectives @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , right , were gunned down by @entity2 during a drug bust gone awry in @entity174 in 2003 disturbing : @entity2 scribbled rap lyrics on a piece of paper around the time he killed two undercover cops , writing in part that he would put ' 45 slogs in da back of ya head ¿ and ¿ i ai n't goin stop to @entity185 dead ' she is expected to plead guilty to having sex with an inmate on monday at a federal court in @entity100			1
there 's also evidence that while he and @entity150 were behind bars together , @entity2 instructed him to try to win sympathy from the jury by saying they had a ‘ rough upbringing			1
’ @entity150 , who pleaded guilty , is serving a 15 - year to life term that he is hoping to get reduced by cooperating			0
the new set of jurors , though not deciding @entity2 's guilt , have once again heard about the fate of two @entity203 officers who were posing as illegal gun buyers			1
the pair met with @entity2 for what they thought was a deal to buy a @entity210 submachine gun			0
but @entity2 decided to rob them instead and ended up shooting both in the head as one pleaded for his @entity213 again in evidence is a scrap of paper @entity2 was carrying when he was arrested			2
it had the rap lyrics saying that if he was ever crossed , he would put ‘ 45 slogs in da back of ya head ’ and ‘ i ai n't goin stop to @entity185 dead			0
’ costly battle : court officials say at least $ 1.6million in taxpayer money has gone to @entity2 's lawyers and to cover other expenses associated with the government 's push to have hm sentenced to death @entity2 , ‘ to impress members of his gang , to raise his status , blasted hollow - point bullets into their brains , ’ prosecutor @entity233 said this week in opening statements			1
‘ they deserved a life			0
now if justice is to be done , the defendant does not			0
’ the defense will counter with anecdotal evidence of @entity2 's troubled background as the son of a crack - addicted mother living with a dozen relatives crammed into an apartment at a crime - infested housing project			1
in his opening statement , defense attorney @entity252 recounted how during childhood , @entity2 also endured time in a psychiatric hospital , where he told a worker that he wanted to die			2
