by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 2 october 2013 some people claim to be unable to function properly early in the morning , while others are most productive at the crack of dawn and now @entity6 researchers believe they understand why			1
scientists have discovered for the first time that there are structural brain differences between early risers and people who naturally find themselves staying up late			2
they believe these differences could help unlock why some night owls are more prone to depression and can suffer from a form of chronic jet lag			2
@entity6 scientists have discovered for the first time that there are structural brain differences between early risers ( pictured ) and people known as night owls who naturally stay up late researchers from @entity27 in @entity6 believe approximately 10 per cent of people can be catagorised as ' morning people , ' while around 20 per cent are true night owls and find themselves staying up late without any effort			1
they think all remaining humans have relatively normal body clocks , which are determined by chronotypes , @entity32 reported			0
the scientists have built on previous research that indicates people who naturally tend to stay up late sleep less well and are more tired during the day and can have what some people describe as a type of chronic jet lag			1
other studies also found that night owls tend to consume more alcohol and tobacco than people with better adjusted body clocks			1
the scientists have built on previous research that indicates people who naturally tend to stay up late ( pictured ) sleep less well and are more tired during the day , and have what some people describe as a type of chronic jet lag the scientists found a reduction in the integrity of the night owl 's white matter in areas of the human brain associated with depression			1
a coloured ct scan is pictured @entity65 at the university , used diffusion tensor imaging to scan the brains of 20 intermediate chronotypes as well as 16 early - birds and 23 night owls			0
her team found a reduction in the integrity of the night owl 's white matter in areas of the human brain associated with depression			1
she told @entity32 : ' we think this could be caused by the fact that late chronotypes suffer from this permanent jet lag			0
' the team believes it could be possible that the gene variants responsible for pushing body clocks towards nocturnal living could affect the physical structure of the brain - although they are not sure if any changes impact on a person 's health			0
commenting on the study , @entity91 - @entity90 , director of the @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , said : ' it 's interesting that there are individual differences , but we need to understand what is causing them and find ways of creating environments in which those differences can be attenuated			0
' dr @entity65 believes that in an ideal word , people 's work schedules should complement their natural sleep patterns			0
however , mr @entity90 said another piece of research suggests that night owls can reduce their exposure to artificial light and spend as much time in the sunlight as possible to force their body clock to shift to a more normal rhythm .			2
