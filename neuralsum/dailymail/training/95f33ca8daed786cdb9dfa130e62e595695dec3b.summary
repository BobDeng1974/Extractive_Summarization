@entity0 and sir @entity1 never saw eye to eye during their spell together at @entity5 , however the @entity7 boss turned to his former manager for reassurance that sparked his management career back into life			1
@entity0 , who takes his @entity7 side to @entity13 where his management career began on saturday in the @entity15 fifth - round , endured a turbulent spell in charge of free - spending @entity18 before being sacked in 2012 after just 11 months in charge			1
as a result @entity0 turned to @entity1 , who he played under between 1988 - 95 at @entity21 , and points to a 90 minute chat with the @entity24 that reinvigorated his desire to take charge of a side again			2
@entity0 has impressed as manager of @entity7 since a torrid spell at the helm of @entity18 ‘ as a player i did n’t ask too much of sir @entity1 , really			1
i did n’t need to have a relationship with him to be honest , ’ @entity0 told the @entity31 ‘ i talked to him just before he retired			0
i went to see him after the @entity18 thing just because i had never done it before			0
i asked his advice , we talked football			0
i thought it was something i would regret if i did n’t do it because i was never the kind of player that would knock on his door and say “ can i have a word , boss ? ” ’ @entity0 was grateful @entity1 gave him so much time and hailed it as a turning point : ‘ sometimes you just need a bit of reassurance , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ ' he assured me in terms of where my standing was in the game and that was good , he ’s a huge influence			0
it was something i needed to do and i ’m glad i did it			0
’ @entity0 , pictured with sir @entity1 and sir @entity61 , played under the @entity24 from 1988 - 95 @entity0 and @entity1 , on the touchline together before the @entity24 retired , rarely saw eye to eye at @entity21			1
