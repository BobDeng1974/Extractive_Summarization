@entity2 said : ' as soon as i found out about the move i was over the moon			2
it 's a huge step up for me			0
newcastle are a club with a massive fanbase , a big history and an unbelievable stadium			0
' first , i am going back to @entity3 for another season and that will be great for my development			1
' hopefully i can come here next summer an even better player			0
he said : ' i 'm delighted for it all to be sorted and i ca n't wait to get started here at @entity0 , ' he said			2
' the loan back is going to be another year but it gives me time to develop my game further before i return			2
i 'm looking forward to the future			0
' @entity0 boss @entity42 seemed delighted with the club 's new acquisitions			0
he said : ' it is a real coup to have signed two of the finest young talents in @entity49 football outside of the @entity50			0
' @entity2 and @entity1 will be a big part of the future of this club			1
they have both performed outstandingly in the @entity55 over the last couple of years and i have no doubt they will be able step up to this level once they return from their loan at @entity3			1
' forest : @entity1 has been @entity3 's @entity64 since january 2013 , and will be again next season transfer : @entity2 was actually the subject of a bid from @entity69 back in 2011 @entity3 's manager , however , was not so pleased with the @entity73 former @entity72 boss expressed his anger at the sale of the pair and claimed he knew little about it			1
but @entity3 's chairman @entity78 said it was necessary to comply with @entity80			0

making his mark : @entity78 purchased the @entity55 club back in 2012 ' should the pair 's proposed move to @entity0 be completed as expected , the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent @entity80 criteria , all the while allowing us to retain two high - quality players for the 2014 - 15 season , paying nothing towards their wages			1
' sadly for me , there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long - term sustainability of @entity3			2
' but while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role , it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the @entity122 added on @entity123 shortly afterwards : ' @entity124 and i work together as a team , and not work behind each other 's backs to bring the best out of this club			0
