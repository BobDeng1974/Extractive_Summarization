@entity0 sounded a warning to @entity2 to beware a @entity4 team on the rebound from their humbling by @entity8 and with @entity9 back in their line - up			1
@entity9 , who completed a full training session on wednesday , is expected to start his first game since minor knee surgery a month ago , and could even return with the captain ’s armband in the absence of the injured @entity18			1
he will reform his formidable strike partnership with @entity0 — the £ 56million @entity21 star who used the eve - of - game press conference at @entity25 ’s @entity24 to remind the world of the @entity28 spirit			1
‘ we are difficult to beat , we have strong character and strong personality and if you want to win against us you have to fight			1
‘ we have thought a lot about why we lost against @entity8			2
it was difficult to accept , not because we thought they were easy — we respected them — but we were playing well and we thought we would start the competition on the right foot			2
‘ losing is never nice			2
we know we lost because we made mistakes			2
we have seen it , analysed it and we are convinced it was our fault			2
we have the tools to react			2
we are ready to face this situation			1
we have overcome similar situations before			2
’ @entity4 ’s experienced manager @entity57 projected a calm confidence in a team which has achieved considerable success			1
his players were semi-finalists in @entity64 four years ago , they won the @entity65 in 2011 and reached the last four in last year ’s @entity66			2
not enough : @entity0 's penalty could n't stop @entity4 suffering a shock defeat to @entity8 they stumbled in the qualifying campaign for this tournament but few expected them to lose 3 - 1 to @entity8 in their first @entity74 fixture on saturday			1
‘ motivation is always a personal process , ’ said @entity57			1
‘ i lead this team but they wo n’t achieve anything if they do n’t want it for themselves			2
we are a team always willing to fight and recover			1
‘ when you lose a game you have two choices : give in or keep united , react and recover			0
that ’s what we ’ve always done			0
‘ we are worried that we lost and started the @entity85 with a defeat because this has an impact on our chances to go through , but this is not over yet			0
dejected : the @entity4 players trudge off after being beaten by @entity8 ‘ we have two games to play			1
two teams will meet who both need to win			0
one will stay in and the other has very little chance to continue			0
we have to be convinced we will reach our aims			0
‘ we ’ve had similar situations where we had negative results and we overcame the situation			0
it does n’t mean we will make it but we know our team always fights until the end			0
my objective is to beat @entity2 and continue in the @entity85			0
if we win this game , we will be really strong			0
’ @entity4 will be without two of their usual back four			1
@entity18 has a knee problem and @entity109 is suspended , but @entity57 said he was not tempted to change tactics			1
rolling the dice : @entity57 is ready to gamble on @entity9 's fitness far more important will be the return of @entity9 , @entity4 ’s record goalscorer , and his physical condition			1
‘ i have often played with @entity9 and we have done wonderful things together , ’ said @entity0 , who put in a light training stint			1
@entity57 , however , admits there is inevitable risk involved			1
‘ @entity9 has recovered well , ’ said the 67 - year - old manager			1
‘ his knee seems to have adapted to the work he ’s been doing			0
he ’s been training and playing with his team - mates during this last week			2
‘ so , he was able to train but we know a training session is not the same as a match			0
if he plays we must consider the possibility that he ’s not as well as he was during the @entity129			0
all smiles : @entity9 is expected to go straight into the side to face @entity2 ' but , even when he is not 100 per cent , he is someone who can give a lot to his team			1
that ’s what we ’re considering right now			0
‘ @entity9 has always wanted to face all the challenges in his career			1
not only playing for the national team but in other situations			0
any time we have needed him in any sort of match he has been willing			0
he has always improved himself and his career is wonderful , brilliant			0
‘ he plays in one of best leagues in the world and has overcome many different problems			0
he is a very important player for us because of his technical abilities and his personality			0

@entity0 set to resume formidable partnership with @entity9
