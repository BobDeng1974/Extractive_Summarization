by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 08:13 est , 21 november 2012 @entity1 was born in a log cabin but his son built himself a mansion			2
@entity5 , the president 's only child to survive to adulthood , built the @entity9 home , called @entity10 , as a seasonal dream home for his wife @entity12 and their children			1
but @entity10 is no dusty museum			1
located on 412 acres ( 167 hectares ) between two spectacular mountain ranges , the homestead offers a feeling of warmth , family and hospitality along with the history lessons			2
scroll down to watch trailer grand : although @entity1 was born in a modest cabin , his son @entity5 built the mansion @entity10 in @entity29 , @entity30 elegant : the dining room at @entity10 which is built in the @entity9 style traditional : @entity35 descendants lived at the home until 1975 and used it as a getaway from @entity39 the site is expecting a boost in interest thanks to the new @entity44 movie @entity1 , which stars @entity45 as the former president and @entity47 as his son			1
the @entity10 staff is looking forward to welcoming more visitors and teaching them about the place where @entity35 descendants lived until 1975 , said @entity52 , press director and group tour leader			1
' i 've been telling people for eight years , which is when i first got here , that this movie was coming , and we 'd get to tell this part of the story , ' @entity54 says			2
' i think people stopped believing me			2
... but we expect visitation to grow from it , and it 's been growing anyway between 8 and 10 per cent annually			0
' one frequently asked question is what @entity10 means			1
@entity54 says the word combines phrases that mean ' hill and valley with a stream , ' and that @entity5 apparently had the name in mind from the start of construction in 1903			1
history on the silver screen : @entity45 as @entity1 and @entity47 as his son @entity79 in the @entity44 movie @entity35 glory : a bust of president @entity1 at the @entity5 mansion in @entity30 ascent to greatness : the front stairway at the home which was built in 1905 by @entity79 , @entity1 's only son to survive into adulthood full steam ahead : the @entity92 car which sits in the driveway of the elegant @entity95 getaway of the @entity5 family visitors also are curious about the relationship between @entity5 and his mother , @entity99 , whom he had committed to a hospital for mental illness			1
decades later , in a bedroom that served as his quarters in later years when he suffered from arthritis , papers were found in a closet safe with medical documentation that validated his decision to hospitalize her			0
before she died , the two were reconciled			0
before building @entity10 , @entity5 had served in @entity39 as secretary of war for president @entity114 and overseas as the @entity116 ' ambassador to @entity117 for president @entity118			1
but @entity5 apparently had wanted to live in @entity30 for many years			1
his law partner @entity119 was born in @entity120 and bought a home in @entity29 15 years before @entity10 was completed			1
after @entity5 became chairman of @entity92 in 1897 , at the time one of the country 's biggest companies , he could afford to build the house of his dreams			1
@entity54 says , however , that the @entity128 ' were not lavish and always wanted simple elegance			0
the @entity131 ' main social life was in @entity132			0
' they lived there half the year and here half the year			0
when they came to @entity30 , it was for the same reasons we do – for a getaway '			2
classic : historians say that the family were not lavish and wanted simple elegance at the home sweeping : a view out the window of the @entity5 mansion @entity10 which is located between two mountain ranges music from the home 's 1,000 - pipe organ draws visitors in at the first step into the entry foyer			1
the parlor , which looks out onto a beautiful east - facing patio and garden with vistas of the @entity157 and @entity158 , could easily be the gathering spot for a modern martini party , book club meeting or holiday meal			0
like much of the 8,000 - square - foot home ( almost 750 square meters ) , the room 's traditional yet tasteful decor seems grand but not showy – very @entity166			0
the walls , for example , were made to look like mahogany but were really made of poplar			0
' @entity5 was like his dad , he counted his pennies , ' @entity54 said			2
the kitchen includes the latest in 20th - century gadgetry and is next to a lovely dining room with a table that could sit about 12 but no more for a formal meal			0
across the hall was the servants ' dining room , another comfortable room that would probably be the hub of the house if it were lived in now			0
part of history : the stove pipe hat and mirror used by @entity1 is seen at the @entity5 mansion @entity10 well - stocked : the kitchen at the @entity9 home which is popular with visitors to the @entity30 area the tour also includes a look at the @entity195 - style master suite , the guest room where president @entity197 stayed and an office with an early predecessor to the copying machine			1
a luxury @entity202 travel train car sits along the winding driveway			0
also located on the estate is an observatory with telescope , an agricultural center and many trails that can be used by day hikers , picnickers and , in the winter , snowshoers and cross-country skiers			2
throughout the year there are programs on topics such as composting and butterfly gardens			0
during the holiday season , the home is decorated as if it were christmas eve 1912			0
that was a year @entity5 was being heavily courted to run for president , said @entity54			1
he chose to stay home .			0

*renewed* interest in @entity30 estate @entity10 thanks to @entity44 movie @entity5 , starring @entity45 as former president and @entity47 as his son
