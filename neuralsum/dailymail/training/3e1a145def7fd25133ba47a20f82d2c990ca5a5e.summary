the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) revealed on friday that they were preparing for the remote possibility of a human rescue mission , should the two large objects spotted by satellite some 2,500 kilometres ( 1,500 miles ) off the coast of @entity108 be related to the missing @entity70 flight			1
@entity110 , the general manager of @entity102 's @entity111 , said the focus of the massive search operation - which now includes 29 planes , 21 ships and six helicopters from more than 20 contributor countries - was first and foremost on trying to locate the large pieces of debris , one up to 24 metres ( 78ft ) in length , the other five metres ( 16 feet )			1

' the two objects are in one of the most remote areas of the world - about the same distance from @entity108 as @entity146 is from @entity147 - which means that aircraft only have a limited time to conduct searches			2
and it takes them four hours to get there			0
what 's more , the area is renowned for shipping debris - so much so that it 's dubbed ' the maritime dustbin '			2
there is a strong chance , therefore , that the objects in fact fell off a ship			0
@entity164 prime minister @entity163 , who announced news of the objects on thursday , warned : ' it could just be a container that has fallen off a ship			0
we just do n't know			0
' treacherous weather hampered thursday 's search effort , but the operation resumed on friday in much clearer weather , with planes scouring an area slightly to the north of the zone that was combed initially			0
this is because strong currents may have moved the objects			0
' it 's about the most inaccessible spot that you can imagine on the face of the earth , but if there is anything down there , we will find it , ' mr @entity163 told reporters in @entity192 , where he is on a visit			2
' we owe it to the families of those people ( on board ) to do no less			0
