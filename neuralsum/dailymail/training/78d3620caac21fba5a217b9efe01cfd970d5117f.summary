@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , has such delicate skin that it erupts in agonising blisters if he gets too warm or gets rubbed or knocked			1
the 18 - month - old baby ’s skin is so red and sore that worried strangers will question whether he has been burnt - forcing his mother , @entity14 , to hand out leaflets explaining his condition			1
@entity5 ( pictured with his mother , @entity14 ) , 18 months old , from @entity7 , has an extremely rare skin condition which means he develops blisters at the slightest touch ms @entity20 , 27 , said : ‘ it ’s frightening how many people just assume his skin is a result of something i have done wrong			1
‘ i ’ve even made cards that i hand out to people who stare at us in the street to educate them about the condition			1
‘ @entity5 reacts really badly to changes in temperatures so i have to be extremely careful when we go out			1
‘ i have to leave his top off sometimes in supermarkets when we go shopping so his body does n’t over heat			0
‘ people always stare at his skin and i ’ve overheard women before whispering about how cold it is and how cruel i must be to not make him wear a t - shirt			1
’ @entity5 suffers from diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis - a condition where the skin is thickened and easily blistered			1
@entity5 , who is now 18 months old , was born with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis @entity5 had to be taken straight to intensive care when he was born because doctors thought he had an infection			1
he was only later diagnosed with the rare skin condition strangers sometimes think that @entity5 has been sunburned and accuse his mother of bad parenting people often stare and mistake @entity5 ’s blistered skin for sunburn - assuming his mother does not properly care for him			1

‘ the doctors thought he might have had an infection so he was taken straight to the @entity68			0
diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is an extremely rare condition			1
it is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin			2
these cells contain substances , such as histamine , that regulate allergic reactions			0
the condition is usually found in children and typically resolves itself by puberty			2
it causes thickening of the skin and agonising blisters			2
there is no cure but treatment helps most patients			0
typical treatments include taking antihistamines to prevent the effect of mast cell histamine			0
source : genetic and @entity96 ‘ i was completely overwhelmed and in a state of shock - my pregnancy was great and i ’d had a reasonably easy labour so why was my baby ’s skin so sore ? ‘ i started blaming myself - i was sick with worry			2
i was advised not to eat peanut butter throughout my pregnancy but i had and i kept thinking it could be the cause			0
‘ the dermatologist came to have a look at him and thought it might be mastocytosis so he did a skin biopsy			2
‘ when doctors confirmed it was diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis i was devastated - the whole process was a complete blur , i ’d never heard of anything like it			1
‘ i was so frightened all i wanted to do was give my baby a cuddle but it would be too painful for his fragile skin			2
‘ i have to be really careful when i hold him because his skin blisters so easily			2
‘ even breastfeeding was a struggle , it would make his body over heat and he would itch constantly			0
‘ now , @entity5 will scream for hours but i just have to sit with him and wait until he calms down - i ca n’t pick him up like other mothers would because it only makes him worse			2
’ the condition can even cause anaphylactic shock - a severe and potentially life threatening reaction			2
it is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin			0
mast cells contain substances such as histamine that regulate allergic reactions			0
it is hoped @entity5 will grow out of the condition by the time he is six or seven years old @entity5 's mother said that after his birth she initially blamed herself for his condition as she did n't know the cause - she says she thought it might have resulted from her eating peanuts when she was pregnant his mother carries cards explaining @entity5 's illness so she can give them to strangers who stare at him @entity5 has a bad reaction to most fruits and veg that contain high levels of histamine including strawberries and tomatoes			1
his mother said : ‘ @entity5 has to take his medication at least four times a day otherwise he can become extremely poorly			1
‘ as @entity5 was born with the condition he is one of the lucky ones and will hopefully grow out of it by the time he ’s seven or eight			1
‘ my dream is to be able to take him on a sunny holiday somewhere and for him to enjoy the heat like any other child			0
ms @entity20 said : ' @entity5 will scream for hours but i just have to sit with him and wait until he calms down - i ca n't pick him up like other mothers would because it only makes him worse ' @entity5 's condition puts him at risk of potentially fatal anaphylactic shock ‘ i ’ve been fundraising for the @entity179 @entity178 with an aim is to raise awareness and to raise money to fund research			1
‘ in february i organised a teddy bear picnic and we raised over £ 700 , there are more events coming up including a @entity189 auction and an entertainment evening at one of our local pubs			0
‘ the charity have been great and helped me understand mastocytosis so much more and i want to give something back			0
’ @entity196 the group leader at the @entity179 @entity178 said : ‘ with mastocytosis the body produces too many mast cells			0
mast cells are found throughout the body in healthy people and have beneficial effects on wound healing and immunity			0
@entity5 has to take medication at least four times a day or he suffers severe allergic reactions @entity5 's mother says she was terrified when he was born and that she just wanted to pick him up and comfort him but that this would have made his condition worse @entity5 's family is now raising money for the @entity179 @entity178 which has helped them ‘ they can also cause disease by becoming involved in allergic reactions			1
‘ a child ’s symptoms vary from child to child and can include itching , flushing , hives , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , nausea , vomiting , gi haemorrhage , bone pain , headache and irritability			0
‘ many doctors have never seen a case of mastocytosis especially @entity233 ’s and even some specialists might not recognise the condition			2
‘ currently there is no cure for mastocytosis however there are options for treating the symptoms of the disease			0
no one treatment is successful in all children			0
