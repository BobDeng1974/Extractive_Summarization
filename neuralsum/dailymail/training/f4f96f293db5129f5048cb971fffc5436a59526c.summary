by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 10 january 2013 scientists have developed a synthetic ' poo ' that could cure nasty intestinal infections caused by the superbug @entity4			1
@entity4 is a toxin - producing bacteria that can multiply in the gut when healthy bacteria have been wiped out by antibiotics			1
it causes severe diarrhoea and other intestinal disease and can be fatal			0
faecal transplants may be an uncomfortable subject , but stools from healthy people have been used for some time to treat patients suffering from the hospital infection			1
the bacteria from a stool transplant can effectively ‘ reset ’ the gut , allowing the body to overcome the infection			2
@entity23 looks at her stool substitute being created in the @entity25 but while the transplants have been successful , the ' ick ' factor makes it difficult for many patients to accept them			2
there is also a small risk of passing on unknown pathogens from the donor that could later cause disease			0
now scientists from the @entity36 in @entity37 have developed a substitute called @entity39 to replace human faecal matter			1
they tested it on two elderly patients with chronic @entity4 infections , in a study published and also tested negative for the superbug six months later			1
' it 's an exciting finding , ' said microbiologist @entity23 , who developed the treatment			0
interestingly , the two patients did n't see the return of @entity4 despite taking further antibiotics later on for other infections			1
unusual experiment : the @entity25 at the @entity36 @entity4 can overtake the guts of hospital patients the synthetic stool is made up from 33 different bacterial strains initially derived from a donor stool			1
they are purified and grown in a ' robo - gut ' , a complex system of flasks , tubes and monitors that together mimic the environment of a large intestine			2
the probiotic is prepared in a thick saline solution , which looks something like a ' vanilla milkshake ' according to @entity70			0
this is then transplanted into patients using a colonoscopy			0
using synthetic poo for transplants eliminates the risk of transmitting an infectious disease through faecal bacteria because ' the exact composition of the bacteria administered is known and can be controlled , ' @entity70 said			1
she added that later testing of stool samples from the two patients showed some features of the synthetic stool had stabilised in their colons			2
' in other words , the introduced microbes were able to persist , ' @entity70 said			0
' this is important because most commercially available probiotics only colonise transiently			0

faecal transplants already successfully used to *tackle* the superbug @entity4 as they *'re* - set ' balance in the gut - but are not *popular* with patients
scientists have developed a synthetic *version* called @entity39 which does the same job , but is safer and better tolerated by patients
