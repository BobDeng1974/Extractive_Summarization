there is an unlikely corner of @entity2 that is forever @entity3			1
to get there , turn left out of @entity10 , right at the @entity12 garage and walk past the cricket ground , but not quite as far as the mock - @entity5 semi with the blue plaque where @entity8 on star @entity7 lived			1
the @entity15 embassy of the world ’s most oppressive regime is the bay - windowed twenties house on the corner of @entity19 and @entity20			1
the one with the curtains and blinds permanently drawn			0
a little piece of @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			0
quitting @entity27 ? the seven - bedroom ordinary home that is the @entity3 embassy where ambassador @entity31 lives even with a 40ft flagpost , it is barely distinguishable from all the other houses in the area			1
any one of them could provide the backdrop to a @entity38 suburban sitcom ; in fact @entity39 was filmed just down the road			0
one might expect this curious diplomatic mission – it doubles as the residence of @entity3 ’s ambassador @entity31 – to be a blur of activity			1
after all , the @entity49 ’s twitchy finger appears to edge closer to the nuclear button by the day			0
true , @entity31 is said to be more ‘ unavailable ’ than normal			1
but it was business as usual for everyone else			0
on friday his wife went out shopping			1
honour : @entity31 , the @entity3 ambassador , presents his credentials to the @entity58 in a private audience at @entity60 last year there was one thing , though			1
notices pinned to the 7ft - high garden wall warn residents not to park outside it on tuesday april 9 , when ‘ loading work will take place ’			2
no one knows what work is due , but @entity71 has warned the @entity73 and @entity15 embassies in @entity25 to evacuate their staff ‘ in the event of conflict from april 10 ’			0
could it mean @entity31 and his team intend to scarper the day before things turn nasty ? or perhaps the embassy is taking delivery of a deadly missile launcher ? farce : @entity7 lived down the same street and there is a blue plaque on the property he used to live in a diplomat in a dark shirt was n’t in the mood to enlighten @entity91 when approached at the edge of the embassy ’s driveway , where two blue @entity95 were parked			1
the reporter ’s outstretched hand was eyed suspiciously before he shook it			0
could we speak to the ambassador ? ‘ no , ’ came the firm reply			2
how about the press attaché ? ‘ no. ’ but one of the neighbours said they were nice people			0
‘ we had some of the diplomats round for a drink once , ’ he said			0
‘ they told us they love @entity2			0
‘ but i suppose that ’s no surprise coming from @entity3 , is it ? one of them said he was a big fan of @entity115			2
’ danger : @entity3 leader @entity71 has repeatedly ramped up the rhetoric in recent weeks threatening a military strike			2

@entity3 embassy is based near @entity10 tube station in a bay - windowed 1920s home
carry on star @entity7 lived down the same street
the wife of @entity3 ambassador @entity31 went out shopping as normal on friday despite *tensions* in @entity3
