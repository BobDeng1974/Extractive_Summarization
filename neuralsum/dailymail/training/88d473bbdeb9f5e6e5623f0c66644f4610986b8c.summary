@entity0 have received 71 reports of witches ghosts and zombies over a three year period - however the @entity4 is officially werewolf - free			1
between 2011 and 2013 , the force was obliged to investigate reports of paranormal activity in what has now been dubbed the @entity10			1
according to @entity12 of the @entity14 ' @entity13 , much of this upsurge is probably due to poor quality @entity16 television shows dealing with the paranormal			1
according to police figures , between 2011 and 2013 there have been 15 ghosts , 55 witches , and two zombies reported to officers in the @entity14 , however , the @entity4 is officially free of werewolves the @entity26 : @entity0 have received 71 ghoulish reports between 2011 - 2013 @entity12 of the @entity28 , pictured , said much of the increase could be down to impressionable people watching television shows such as @entity32 featuring witches and the paranormal according to figures released under the @entity36 , @entity0 have received 15 reports of ghosts , 55 incidents of witchcraft and a pair of zombies roaming the area over a three year period			1
the paranormal researcher asked for the number of reports of ghosts , werewolves , witches and zombies over the past three calendar years received by @entity0			1
the unnamed person wanted to know especially ' any other details included in the calls ? ie seven werewolves attacking people ' and what action was taken by police			1
according to the @entity68 document : ' the reports include ghost , zombie and witch sightings , hearing and communicating with the aforementioned , the use of witchcraft , claims to be a witch and witch hunters			1
i have not included terms such as " she called me a witch " , " he was in a zombie - like state "			1
' however , according to the figures , 2013 featured record complaints of incidents involving ghosts and witches and worryingly the first two reports of zombies in the region			1
no reports of werewolves activity were made by the region 's 2.8 million population			1
the paranormal reports were spread across @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
mr @entity12 said : ' i am very surprised by the number of reports of witchcraft			2
i guess that is down to the popularity of tv shows such as @entity32			2
' we set up the @entity28 in 1989 and we have received thousands of reports of paranormal activity			1
it is fair to say that there is a @entity10			2
' we investigate each case on its own individual merits			0
it may seem surprising but we do not go to a house to either prove or disprove the presence of a ghost or spirit			0
there are charlatans out there who arrive with psychics who claim they can talk to the spirits or the little boy who had been murdered in the corner , but that is utter bunkum			0
' our job is simply to reassure people who are facing a problem			0
in may cases , it does n't really matter if a house is haunted or not , if the person is convinced and they are in danger , then they will want to move			2
' mr @entity12 said he received one report of a werewolf in @entity93			2
he added : ' she was convinced a werewolf was feeding in her bins but it turned out to be a dog			0
we have had other cases of people convinced they could hear voices and they 've turned out to be the neighbours			2
' force spokesman , @entity146 , said : ' our officers routinely see the consequences of spirits when things go bump ... but that tends to be of a night when the pubs have closed their doors and we â€™re making sure people get home safely			0
' while the figures can seem amusing , behind some of these " supernatural " calls may be a deeply troubled individual or a person wasting valuable police time which would be better spent preventing real crimes			1
' @entity0 always take action against those found to be knowingly making false and malicious calls to the emergency services			1
' in may , mother - of - three @entity168 , 35 claimed she filmed ufos above her home in @entity93 , @entity14			2
the video she made shows a formation of three or four lights , rising and falling together in the night sky			0
she claimed she filmed the phenomenon for at least 40 minutes - only breaking off for to put on her slippers when her feet got cold			2
ms @entity178 said she spent 40 minutes filming the unidentified flying object outside her home in @entity93 she said : ' i was painting upstairs then went to the back door for a cig			0
i looked up and there were these shapes , like red orbs , in the sky			0
' they did n't look like stars or planes or helicopters , they were just hanging there			0
i thought i 'd had a few too many rum and cokes			0
' i got my phone and zoomed in on them			0
i was there for about 20 minutes , my feet were freezing but i could n't come away			0
' eventually i had to come back inside for my slippers and fags , then i went back out and filmed another 20 minutes			0
' i must have looked mad out there for so long just filming the sky but it was so strange i did not want to go inside			0
