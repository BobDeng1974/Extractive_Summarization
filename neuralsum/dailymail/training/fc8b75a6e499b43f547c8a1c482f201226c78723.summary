by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:34 est , 20 february 2014 @entity3 : 15:26 est , 20 february 2014 new battle lines are being drawn in the fight between gun - control advocates in @entity7 and @entity9 advocacy groups , over a proposal that would mandate the ' personalization ' of every new gun sold in the @entity1			0
sen. @entity13 , a @entity15 @entity14 , is behind a bill that would prohibit the sale of run - of - the - mill guns , requiring biometric technologies such as fingerprint recognition or a paired device – such as a wristwatch – that would authorize a gun to fire if it is nearby			1
the gun rights lobby appears to be gearing up for a fight			0
' the gun prohibition lobby wants it mandated so that they can control the freedom of choice of every gun owner and gun on the market , ' @entity27 founder @entity26 told @entity35			2
the man with the golden handprint : the most recent @entity39 flick , ' @entity40 , ' included a gun that only 007 could shoot a large gun shop in @entity43 is selling the @entity44 , which requires a wireless link to a special wristwatch in order to fire firearms like this @entity50 could soon be required to feature a fingerprint sensor in order to operate -- but just try using it with gloves on @entity26 's objections are practical as well as philosophical			1
' the problem with " smart guns " is that they are dumb when they really need to be used in self - defense by multiple family members , ' he said , ' or for that matter by police partners at a crime in progress when one officer needs to use the other officer 's gun			1
' ' if the police wo n't use them , ' @entity26 asked , ' why should i ? ' the @entity71 , through its lobbying - arm @entity73 , strongly opposes ' government mandates that require the use of expensive , unreliable features , such as grips that would read your fingerprints before the gun will fire			1
' the @entity71 also says on its website that it ' recognizes that the " smart guns " issue clearly has the potential to mesh with the anti-gunner 's agenda , opening the door to a ban on all guns that do not possess the government - required technology			2
' ' " safety " in the gun control lexicon means " restriction " , ' @entity93 radio host @entity92 said during his show on wednesday			0
just squeeze : another approach is this @entity100 pistol equipped with sensors that can determine whether the gun 's owner is holding it , based on the tightness of the grip at several locations along the handle @entity108 host @entity92 is among the gun - rights leaders who believes a government requirement of new gun technologies could pave the way for the confiscation of older weapons next up : personalizing your ammo -- one proposal under consideration would require a gun 's firing pin to imprint a unique identifying mark on brass shell casings when guns are fired -- an indented id of sorts that would connect the gun with the spent cartridge these concerns are shared by many in the gun industry , even though new technologies would come with a markup that could be lucrative , and a slowing of secondhand sales might create a short - term sales bonanza			1
industry executives told @entity35 that @entity13 's bill would require them to sell tools that have glaring shortcomings , and might create new legal liabilities			1
' what happens when a criminal wrestles away your handgun , points it at your chest and pulls the trigger ? ' asked one who declined to be named , citing legal concerns			0
' if you 're wearing a smart watch connected to the gun , it 's still going to fire			1
' ' and what happens when the watch battery runs out ? ' @entity15 sen. @entity13 , a reliable progessive , wants every new gun sold in @entity1 to come with a system that would limit its use to the person it belongs to gun makers , he said , are getting legal advice about the future pitfalls that will come with selling weapons that can only be used by a single person			1
' a gun is property			0
it 's not a license in and of itself , like a @entity173 ticket , ' he explained			0
' if you 've bought it , you should be able to loan it to whomever you want , as long as that person is responsible with the firearm and has been trained in how to use it			0
' ' the first time an intruder rapes a woman because she could n't fire her husband 's revolver , someone in this industry is going to get sued			2
' but a few intrepid gun retailers , including one near @entity189 , are making these cutting - edge guns available			0
' ' it could revolutionize the gun industry , ' @entity192 owner @entity191 told the @entity195			2
sen. @entity13 hopes it also revolutionizes the tension between the @entity9 and the government 's obligation to keep ordinary @entity1 safe			1
' in the 21st century , we should use advances in technology to our own advantage and save lives , ' he said in a statement and the @entity207 will help ensure that only authorized users can operate handguns			0
' ' this is the type of gun safety legislation that everyone – regardless of political party or affiliation – should be able to support			0

@entity15 @entity218 sen. @entity13 's bill would require safety devices on every new gun to prohibit anyone but the owner from firing
gun right activists say the technology is *dangerous* since it can stop gun owners ' family members from defending themselves against *attackers*
police forces do n't use the technologies , which include biometric finger sensors and paired watches that must be near a gun to make it shoot
watch batteries go dead , industry experts *caution* , gun owners wearing gloves have no fingerprints , and companies would be open to lawsuits
