@entity6 , 16 , bought a drug used to kill patients by lethal injection on @entity10 after suffering a ‘ mini crisis of confidence ’ a month before her death			2
but her father , @entity14 , 66 , told an inquest that @entity16 , a top student who was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder , had seemed to be ‘ back on track ’ after talking to her school tutor			1
tragic : @entity6 , 16 , killed herself with a drug bought over the internet			2
she was found dead in her bedroom at the family home mr @entity14 said : ‘ there was absolutely nothing which indicated that there was a problem			1
’ then , on the morning of december 18 , 2011 , @entity30 ’s mother @entity29 , 56 , discovered her youngest daughter dead in her bunk bed at their £ 400,000 home , in @entity35 , @entity36			1
the couple tried to resuscitate @entity16 , a keen horse rider who wanted to become a vet , but she was pronounced dead in hospital			0
upsetting : @entity14 told of his doomed attempt to save the life of his 16 - year - old daughter a post-mortem examination and toxicology tests revealed a significant amount of the drug in her blood			1
there were no drugs or alcohol in her system other than the substance , which she had drunk with mouthwash			0
police examined her computer and discovered that in late october @entity16 had begun reading online forums and researching how terminally ill patients could end their own lives			1
they also found a typed a list of reasons why she should end her life			0
at around the same time , the drug was sent to the family home from either @entity71 or @entity72			1
mr @entity14 , a barrister who sits as a crown court recorder and a part - time immigration judge in @entity36 , said he was at a loss to understand why his daughter , known as ‘ @entity78 ’ , would take her own life			1
he said : ‘ @entity80 was a top student in physics			0
the only thing she complained about was not getting enough homework			0
’ the inquest heard @entity30 had moved to @entity85 , @entity36 , to start her a-levels in september 2011			2
she appeared to be doing well but unexpectedly took a week off school in november			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ when she was off i was asking , “ are you pregnant or being bullied ” and she said “ no ”			2
’ he said @entity30 spoke to one of her tutors because there was some concern about how she was coping and ‘ a few tears were shed ’			2
but the following week she returned to school and ‘ it was business as usual for the family ’			0
difficult day : @entity99 , right , the sister of @entity16 , is pictured leaving @entity101 court recording a verdict of suicide , coroner @entity102 said : ‘ @entity30 had a mini crisis of confidence			1
‘ there was no clue or indication of what was going through her mind			0
it ’s a strange time of life for teenagers ; hormones are raging , there are pressures which we do not recognise when we ’re older , and on occasion they do harm themselves			0
’ mr @entity102 said he would write to the government ’s chief pharmaceutical officer about stopping young people from acquiring lethal drugs on the internet			0
