by @entity0 @entity2 successfully launched a live monkey into space last week , the government said today			1
there is no independent confirmation of the achievement and there have been no announcements by @entity11 powers of any @entity2 launch late last week			1
the monkey was said to have returned ' intact ' , an achievement the @entity2 celebrated as an advance in a missile and space programme that has given the @entity19 and @entity20 cause for concern			1
in 2011 , president @entity32 unveiled the space capsule designed to carry the live monkey into space but that attempt was reported to have failed			1
at the time , @entity36 touted the launch of a large animal into space as the first step towards sending a man into space , which @entity43 says is scheduled for 2020			2
@entity2 sent small animals into space - a rat , turtles and worms - aboard its kavoshgar - 3 rocket in 2010			1
claims : @entity51 said the monkey was ' alive ' after travelling to an altitude of 75 miles for a sub-orbital flight as part of ' preparations for sending a man into space , ' which is scheduled for 2020 @entity2 has sent small animals into space - a rat , turtles and worms - in 2010			1
in september , @entity2 suggested it may also launch @entity64 cats into space @entity2 's decade - long space programme has raised alarms in the @entity19 because the same technology that allows missiles to launch satellites can be used to fire warheads			2
@entity20 , the @entity72 and others claims that @entity2 is trying to develop nuclear weapons but the country 's president , @entity32 , denies that			2
@entity43 maintains that its nuclear work is nothing but peaceful			0
fruit flies were the first animals be sent into space when they were put on board a @entity72 - launched v - 2 rocket on february 20 , 1947			1
two years later , @entity85 , a @entity86 , became the first monkey to go into space			1
@entity2 president @entity32 looking and pointing at the domestically produced @entity91 rocket to carry satellites into space during a ceremony in @entity43 february 3 , 2010 the space race really gathered speed in november 1957 when @entity97 sent @entity98 the dog into orbit aboard the @entity102 spacecraft			2
then , on january 31 , 1961 , @entity103 became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the @entity108 space programme			0
one of over a dozen chimpanzees trained by the @entity72 to beat the @entity111 ’s attempt to win the space race , @entity103 made history as the @entity114 extended into orbit			0
as the @entity97 moved closer to sending a human into space , the @entity72 decided to use three - year - old @entity103 — in a style reminiscent of a gas - detecting canary in a mine — to find out whether humans would be able to survive in such conditions			0
on january 31 , 1961 , @entity103 became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the @entity108 space programme three chimpanzees @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127 eat snacks while strapped in their model space capsules			0
the chimps were among 75 being trained for space missions at @entity132 in @entity133 on jan 13 , 1961 the most famous of all the chimps who were launched in @entity137 space capsules that ultimately carried @entity138 , the first @entity72 man into orbit , @entity103 was actually not named until after his january 1961 flight succeeded			2
the name by which he ’s now known — an acronym for @entity145 at the @entity146 — was only used when he returned safely to earth			0
this was because @entity108 reportedly wanted to avoid bad publicity should a named and therefore humanised animal be killed			0
originally from @entity151 in @entity152 , and once a star attraction for a @entity155 zoo , @entity103 was added to the astro - chimp team in the @entity157 to go into space			0
the difference between @entity103 and the @entity97 dogs , which were preferred by the @entity111 because of their ability to sit still for longer periods , was that he would not only go up into space , but also come down again safely .			0
