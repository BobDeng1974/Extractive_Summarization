‘ we started the @entity1 in our shorts and that ’s how we ’re ending it			0
’ @entity4 had a different take on how to present football on television and those words delivered in his opening to @entity12 ’s coverage of last year ’s @entity1 final in @entity14 summed it up			1
he and his beach - side @entity12 pundits , all shorts and smiles , navigated a minority of viewers through @entity21 v @entity22			1
the vast majority had chosen the @entity24 , their studio and sensible suits			1
@entity4 sports shorts and flip flops while presenting @entity12 's @entity1 coverage in @entity30 last summer @entity4 , who has been replaced as @entity12 's lead football host , pictured in west @entity32 on friday @entity4 will be replaced at @entity12 by @entity24 broadcaster and commentator @entity33 but at the end of the evening , when @entity4 told us it had been an ‘ absolute privilege ’ to present a @entity1 from @entity30 , you knew he meant it			1
he is a genuine fan			0
do n’t let @entity4 ’ taciturn style kid you — he is a very capable live tv presenter but he has looked an uncomfortable match for @entity12 ’s portfolio of broadcast rights			1
@entity4 is a non-conformist and he ca n’t ‘ sell ’ a big tv match as hard as others can			2
that ’s an issue for a commercial channel			0
the great @entity51 had a lovely phrase to accentuate his ‘ me against the world ’ standpoint and i half - expected @entity4 to borrow it and open a programme with a morose look accompanied by : ‘ @entity59 me , what a life ! ’ and , of course , when it came to those dreaded head - to - heads with the @entity24 , he had a @entity66 winner in @entity67 to compete with on the other channel			1
what @entity4 did bring were refreshingly different questions , many that could have come straight off the terraces			2
it made for interesting responses			0
and throw him an unusual camera shot and he could conjure up a quirky line			0
@entity4 after @entity79 's game against @entity80 in @entity81 was suspended for an electrical storm @entity4 is hit by a sprinkler in @entity84 alongside colleagues @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 he was also thrown pitch - side presentation and @entity91 ’s moods — not easy to handle			2
sadly , he had n’t done a deal with the weather gods			0
a downpour in @entity95 saw a @entity1 qualifier postponed , giving @entity4 two hours to fill			2
then an electric storm in @entity81 last summer halted @entity79 ’s friendly against @entity80 and left @entity4 and his colleagues sweltering			1
‘ i ’m off to the dry cleaners ! ’ said a sweat - sodden @entity4 as the match resumed			0
@entity4 is to be replaced by broadcast journalist @entity33			1
this is a big break for a polished radio performer who now has the chance to forge a more substantial tv career .			0
