rapid evolution of @entity1 , the human immunodeficiency virus , is slowing its ability to cause @entity3 , according to a study of more than 2,000 women in @entity6			1
scientists said the research suggests a less virulent hiv could be one of several factors contributing to a turning of the deadly pandemic , eventually leading to the end of @entity3			0
' overall we are bringing down the ability of @entity1 to cause @entity3 so quickly , ' @entity14 , a professor at @entity15 who led the study , said in a telephone interview			1
red balloons are released to mark @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23 : rapid evolution of @entity1 , the humanimmunodeficiency virus , is slowing its ability to cause @entity3 , according to a study of more than 2,000 women in @entity6			1
the world has finally reached ' @entity27 ' of the @entity12 , a leading campaign group claimed today			0
the number of people newly infected with @entity1 over the last year was lower than the number of hiv - positive people getting access to the medicines they need to keep @entity3 at bay			1
the report was released by the one campaign , an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in @entity6 , to mark @entity21			0
' but it would be overstating it to say @entity1 has lost its potency -- it 's still a virus you would n't want to have			2
' some 35 million people currently have @entity1 and @entity3 has killed around 40 million people since it began spreading 30 years ago			1
but campaigners noted on monday that for the first time in the epidemic 's history , the annual number of new hiv infections is lower than the number of @entity1 positive people being added to those receiving treatment , meaning a crucial tipping point has been reached in reducing deaths from @entity3			1
@entity14 's team conducted their study in @entity60 and @entity6 -- two countries badly hit by @entity3 -- where they enrolled more than 2,000 women with @entity1			1
first they looked at whether the interaction between the body 's natural immune response and @entity1 leads to the virus becoming less virulent or able to cause disease			0
previous research on @entity1 has shown that people with a gene known as @entity71 * 57 can benefit from a protective effect against @entity1 and progress more slowly than usual to @entity3			1
the scientists found that in @entity60 , @entity1 has evolved to adapt to @entity71 * 57 more than in @entity6 , so patients no longer benefited from the protective effect			2
but they also found the cost of this adaptation for @entity1 is a reduced ability to replicate -- making it less virulent			0
conceptual view of @entity1 within the blood - stream : some 35 million people currently have @entity1 and @entity3 haskilled around 40 million people since it began spreading 30years ago			2
the scientists then analysed the impact on @entity1 virulence of the wide use of @entity3 drugs			2
using a mathematical model , they found that treating the sickest @entity1 patients -- whose immune systems have been weakened by the infection -- accelerates the evolution of variants of @entity1 with a weaker ability to replicate			2
' @entity1 adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate , ' @entity14 said			0
' anything we can do to increase the pressure on @entity1 in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of @entity1 over time			0
' the study was published on monday in the journal @entity107 ( @entity107 )			0
