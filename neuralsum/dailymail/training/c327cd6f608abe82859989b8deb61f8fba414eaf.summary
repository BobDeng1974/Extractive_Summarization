@entity0 has told @entity2 fans 2015 will be a year to remember - for all the right reasons			1
as @entity5 their supporters will reflect on a roller - coaster 12 - month period that has seen them hit more lows than highs			2
for the first time in 28 years , the club fired their manager			2
@entity13 ' six - year contract was ripped up after just 10 months and @entity2 went on to finish seventh in the @entity15			1
@entity16 gives a wry smile as he speaks to the press at @entity2 's @entity19 on tuesday the board turned to @entity16 to revive the club 's fortunes , and the early signs were not good as @entity2 won just one of their opening six games and crashed out of the @entity27 to @entity29 side @entity28			1
the @entity30 has slowly started turning things round though and at the half way stage @entity2 are third in the table following a run of seven wins and two draws in their last nine matches			1
@entity16 strives for perfection though so he is not happy with @entity2 's current plight and is hoping there will be a better year ahead for the club 's fans			1
@entity16 has stabilised the @entity2 side alongside @entity44 as they seek a strong 2015 @entity2 have climbed up the table after a torrid start to the @entity15 season ' we are improving every week and we shall be better in 2015			2
just watch , ' the @entity2 manager said			2
' we are still in a process			0
i think the players understand the philosophy , and that 's why we are improving - but we can improve more when we have all the players available			0
' i think the fans were fantastic because we were in a moment with 10 matches and 13 points - that is not good , i think more weak than good			1
' they have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team			0
@entity65 keeper @entity64 makes himself big to deny @entity66 during the goalless draw last weekend ' we were not always ahead in matches but they have fought to the end and a lot of times with good success , so i think we can be satisfied about the points now - 36			1
' we are in our goal , i think			0
what i have already said , we are improving every week			0
we can see 2015 with open eyes			0
' after almost six months in the job , @entity16 is now settled in @entity79			1
' @entity81 life is fantastic , ' the @entity30 said with a smile			1
' i have met only friendly people on the streets and in the restaurants where i go			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 speaks during a press conference on tuesday ' i have very nice neighbours ; they are all older than me but very nice			2
i live in a surrounding environment [ that is ] fantastic			0
' and the 63 - year - old has even found a local eatery that suits his palate in @entity93			0
he said : ' my favourite food is @entity95 food , and the restaurant is wing 's			0
' the food is fantastic because when i came to @entity81 everybody said the food is not good , but [ it is ] fantastic			0
also , the wine list is fantastic			0
' @entity16 's first assignment of 2015 is to stretch @entity2 's unbeaten run to 10 games at @entity105 on @entity106			1
club record signing @entity108 could feature against @entity105 on @entity106 @entity16 has made his anger clear at fixture planners for organising @entity2 's game at @entity65 less than 48 hours after their @entity113 victory over @entity114			1
as a result , the 63 - year - old is expected to rotate his team for the match at the @entity119			0
@entity120 and @entity121 could start after suffering no reaction when they made their injury comeback at @entity125 last sunday			1
@entity126 , @entity127 and @entity108 are back in training and could feature , but @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 are likely to miss out			0
@entity2 have only lost once in 20 years at the @entity119 , but @entity133 ' team have won their last two games and @entity16 is bracing himself for a tough test , partly because of the ' difficult ' surface he expects to find at the @entity138 ' ground			1
' i hear from ( assistant manager ) @entity44 [ @entity44 ] that @entity105 is a very difficult pitch , ' @entity16 said .			2

the @entity30 feels settled into life at @entity79 after six months
after only 13 points from 10 games , @entity2 are now third in the league
@entity2 drew 0 - 0 with @entity65 at @entity125 on sunday
the @entity152 club travel to @entity105 on @entity106
