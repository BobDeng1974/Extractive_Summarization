' it ’s hard for football teams to find a sponsor			2
i personally have n’t come across anyone yet that has found it anything other than funny			0
' not impressed : a spokesman for the university ( pictured ) said the shirts will not be allowed to be worn university spokesman @entity67 , however , said : ' the @entity1 sports department would never sanction sponsorship of this type - it is totally inappropriate			1
