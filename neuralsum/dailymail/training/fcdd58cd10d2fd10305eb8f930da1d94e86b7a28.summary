the flecks of grey hair betray his advancing years but , even at 37 , @entity3 does not have to think too far back for his last appearances in a @entity6 shirt			1
two games against a @entity8 and @entity9			2
@entity3 was playing for a @entity11 team and the pre-match preparations were , let us say , not quite what they were in his @entity17 heyday			1
‘ it was different , ’ says @entity3 , breaking into laughter			1
‘ i ’m used to going to bed at a certain time , especially before a game			2
@entity3 trains with his @entity24 team - mates , including @entity25 ( second from the left ) @entity3 enjoys himself during a recent press conference ahead of his return to @entity17 ‘ @entity39 asked if i wanted to play and i thought , “ yeah , i ’m not doing anything , i ’ll come out ”			1
there was me , @entity36 , @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
who kept me up ? everyone			2
’ two months on and there have been no more late nights as @entity3 , an @entity44 winner with @entity6 14 years ago , returns to @entity17 to face his old club in the fourth round on saturday as a @entity24 player			1
the last few weeks have , he admits , ‘ been a bit of a whirlwind ’			2
‘ at 37 , would i have been thinking i ’d be playing against @entity6 at @entity17 ? probably not , but i ’m going to relish every moment			1
‘ it ’s going to be great			0
you get into football for the love of the game and to win trophies , and i managed to do that at @entity6			1
i had a wonderful time			0
’ @entity3 ’s thoughts were turning to the beach in @entity61 when a chance meeting with @entity63 , an old @entity64 team - mate , led to an invitation to have a trial for @entity24 in an under 21 game			1
after leaving the @entity68 , @entity3 went to play in the @entity69 with @entity70 but a chance meeting with former @entity64 team - mate @entity63 earned him a move to @entity24 the 6ft 2in former @entity74 striker had not played properly for six months since being released by @entity75 club @entity70			1
he was training at @entity76 but @entity63 saw enough in the first 15 minutes to know that he could still play in the championship			1
@entity3 signed a short - term deal on @entity79 and scored for his new club against @entity76 two days later , assisted by @entity25 , another veteran enjoying a new lease of life at @entity24			1
‘ i tried to sign @entity3 for @entity83 but the big bugger would n’t come , ’ says @entity63			1
‘ he did n’t have a choice this time once i got a grip on him			0
’ @entity3 ’s career peaked at @entity6			1
a battering ram of a centre forward , he scored 60 goals in 223 games after signing for a then club record £ 11million , and was part of @entity95 ’s treble - winning side that lifted the @entity44 , @entity96 and @entity97 in 2001			1
that year he also scored @entity74 ’s fifth goal in a 5 - 1 @entity100 qualifying win over @entity101 in @entity102			0
‘ it was a great year and a great time to be playing football , ’ he recalls			0
@entity106 did not follow quite so easily after that , however			0
in the next eight years , @entity3 scored only 38 goals for @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
the former @entity6 striker shakes hands with @entity115 legend @entity114 back in 2000 @entity3 playing for current club @entity24 ( left ) and during his days as a @entity6 striker ( right ) when he retired from international football after the @entity120 , in which he was made the scapegoat for @entity74 ’s failure under @entity123 , he had just seven @entity74 goals in 62 games			1
his advocates point out that he was a target man who brought out the best from a succession of strike partners including @entity130 and @entity131			2
to others he became a figure of fun			0
when @entity3 scored for @entity24 last month , local comic @entity135 had to make good on a bet and clean the striker ’s boots			1
even the fans ’ version of walking in a @entity141 includes the line ‘ he used to be s * * * e but now he ’s all right ’			0
@entity63 is not alone in believing that his old friend has a point to prove , but @entity3 says his record speaks for itself : ‘ @entity148 , @entity44 , @entity97 , @entity149 , @entity150 , played in two @entity151 , two euros			1
‘ if i could have got more goals , i would have loved to			0
but it never hindered me from achieving and winning trophies			0
@entity3 scores for @entity24 against @entity76 after being set up by fellow veteran striker @entity25 @entity3 revealed he hopes to play for one more year and will enjoy every minute he has left playing ‘ between 2004 and 2008 i did n’t get picked for @entity74			1
then i came back at 30 and played until 32			2
people asked why i was being picked again but managers were picking me and they were happy			0
’ @entity3 still looks in shape but he is reminded that his new @entity24 team - mate @entity159 was born on the same day that he made his @entity68 debut for @entity64 in 1995			1
in the under 21 trial against @entity162 , he faced @entity164 ’s son @entity163			0
did @entity165 kick him as well ? ‘ he tried , ’ says @entity3			2
‘ when i was growing up , everyone was saying that you ’re finished at 35			0
you ’ve got that in your mind and when i got to 35 , i thought i was finished			0
‘ but you realise you can play to whatever age you want as long as you change your game and your legs hold out			0
‘ i ’ve seen many players do it			0
you ’ve got @entity175 doing it , @entity177 , @entity25 ... @entity178 is 35 in may			0
@entity179 played until he was 42			2
it ’s how you live your life			0
‘ i feel i can play another year			0
whether that happens is another thing			0
