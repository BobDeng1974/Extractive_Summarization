an @entity1 online retailer has come up with a novel way to keep bearded hipsters and long - haired lasses looking smooth when taking calls on their shiny new @entity6 6 's			1
in the latest @entity10 controversy , people around the world have been complaining that the new smartphone is pulling out hair			1
the social media hashtag # @entity14 went viral after allegations that new owners are getting their locks and beards ' snagged ' between the aluminium and glass parts of the new phones when holding it to their faces			1
but do n't worry : if you were thinking of upgrading to @entity10 's latest yourself , apparently @entity24 can shave you			2
in response , and on the back of a string of hoax advertisements suggesting the phone is good for shaving a woman 's legs and trimming a man 's facial hair , @entity1 's biggest online retailer is offering free razors with each new @entity6 purchased through its site			1
' do n't tear your hair out looking for the best @entity40 deal — this is it , ' says ceo @entity41 in a @entity43 release			0
' but it is a limited time offer			0
it might be hair today , gone tomorrow			0
you wo n’t find any other retailers able to trim this much off an @entity6 and provide you with a free shaver as well			0
' ' the last thing we want is @entity1 walking around with unsightly bald patches just because they wanted the latest smartphone , ' said @entity41 , nobly			0
this latest scandal , following on from ' bendgate ' , has led to a flurry of angry posts on @entity58 under the hashtags # @entity14 and # @entity80			1
' anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the @entity83 ? it catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it when i make calls , ' tweeted @entity55 @entity89 complained : ' the seam on my @entity6 where the aluminium meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out			2
' others have said the phone ' has it all ' and can save you money on going to the hairdressers			0
response : the latest complaint led to some creating mock adverts , one was as a beard trimmer for men smooth : another involved a woman apparently shaving her legs using the @entity6 6 earlier this month , the electronics giant were forced to respond to complaints the phones were bending			1
@entity10 said its iphones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high - stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry			0
' with normal use , a bend in @entity6 is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted @entity10 with a bent @entity124 , ' said @entity10 spokeswoman @entity125 @entity126 , ceo of @entity127 , a company which customizes and gold plates the @entity112 , said the only way an @entity6 may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time			0
@entity24 's founder and ceo @entity41 has denied rumours his entrepreneurial company would also begin offering reinforced jeans with online purchases of the @entity124			2
problem : @entity89 , blaming the design of the phone for the issue , referred to the problem as ' seamgate ' attribute : @entity146 put a positive spin on the newest perceived flaw saying the @entity40 is now the phone that ' does it all ' economical : another social media user said the problem could provide assistance to personal finances , as it would save you money on going to a hairdresser			1
