by @entity0 for the @entity1 the @entity2 , racing ’s oldest classic , and host track @entity5 have received a major boost with news that sponsors @entity9 have extended their deal until 2016			1
it had been feared that the bookmaker would pull out of backing the race it had supported for 10 years because of the fresh clash with the new @entity17 champions weekend			1
@entity9 and @entity5 were both left deeply frustrated that the rival fixture was nodded through with @entity21 support without any consultation with them			2
@entity23 ( far left ) powered to victory in this year 's @entity2 at @entity5 that frustration still festers but fears that the inaugural @entity17 meeting would detract from the @entity2 proved unfounded			2
over 60,000 attended the four - day meeting , half of them on @entity2 day and viewing figures in @entity31 were up			0
however , @entity9 have warned any hope of the deal being extended further heavily depends on the wider commercial deals in the sport involving @entity36 plus @entity38 rights			1
more than 60,000 fans attended the four - day meeting at @entity5 and tv viewing figures were up @entity42 , managing director of @entity43 , said : ‘ it is well known within the industry that we were disappointed by the @entity21 's approach to supporting the decision of @entity17 champions weekend to clash with @entity50 weekend			1
‘ we were concerned that having worked so hard with @entity5 and others in racing to restore the status of the race , the move could lead to conflicts of interests for many in the build - up to the race and on the day itself			2
‘ the easy thing to do would be to walk away from the @entity2 now that our current agreement has ended			0
it would save us significant costs and make a clear point about our frustrations with the way in which the race planning developments played out			0
‘ however , at a time when @entity69 @entity68 and betting operators are working hard to find a sustainable , commercially - based model for our future partnership , and one which addresses the substantial issues arising from the double - whammy of declining consumer interest in betting on racing and increasing costs to betting operators , such a decision would be short - sighted and unhelpful			0
@entity83 with his horse @entity82 was among high - profile winners at the @entity17 champions weekend ‘ we want to continue to build the profile of the @entity50 and our successful partnership with @entity88			1
‘ we see this sponsorship renewal as part of a potential template for the way in which betting operators and commercial organisations within @entity68 can work together for the long term			0
‘ all of our sponsorships will now be considered within a wider commercial framework covering other elements of the flow of our funds to parties in @entity68 - specifically @entity36 , @entity102 , @entity103 and other media / advertising spend			0
’ @entity9 spokesman @entity106 said the firm would continue to monitor the effect of the fixture clash despite the initial encouraging figures			2
he added : ‘ @entity17 champions weekend is not going to get any smaller nor is its marketing spend			1
we will be watching the situation going forward			0
