by @entity0 for the @entity1 why is the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity — both cornerstones of the modern feminist movement — measured by the number of women who are in top jobs such as directors of @entity12 companies or @entity14 judges ? the depressing answer is that the so - called feminist agenda has been hijacked by one group of women who have turned it into a self - improvement manifesto for their own social type : the well - educated , professional and political elite of high - flying woman			1
recently , professor @entity24 , an economist at @entity25 , argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women — those who did n’t go to university , those who are stay - at - home mums and those in low - paid jobs			1
this privileged middle - class sisterhood — who have enough money to farm out their childcare to a small army of nannies , au pairs and nursery school teachers — judge themselves by the success of their working lives			1
sadly , they judge all other women , too , by the same unreasonable yardstick			1
in doing so , they patronisingly ignore millions of other women , many of whom would prefer to stay at home and raise a family — at least until their children start full - time education			1
the fact is that many of those women who choose to work treat their often low - grade , poorly - paid job principally as a financial means of supporting their family , rather than as an end in itself			1
in short , whereas there is a powerful feminist elite who live to work , the vast majority of women work — if they have to , for economic reasons — simply as a means to live			1
the tragedy is that , in their blinkered attitude , modern feminists are causing deep damage to the latter for not espousing their values			2
thanks to their high public profiles and influential positions , they are able to dictate how the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity should be measured			1
to watch the video in full please click here @entity39 deputy leader @entity38 ( pictured ) has criticised @entity40 for her comments on feminism and , of course , they measure it as they measure their own success — strictly in terms of work			1
as a result , the policies of governments of all political parties over recent years have been dominated by the principle of getting all women into work or back into work			2
this , in my view , is utterly misguided			2
for the unforeseen consequence is that @entity112 is now one of the most family - unfriendly countries in the developed world — with a distorted tax and benefit system to match			1
astonishingly , given how often @entity120 talks about the importance of marriage and the family , he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single - earner households and which seems to be driven by the belief that even mothers with young children should go out to work as much as possible			1
this emphasis on working - women perfectly suits those well - educated , professional , middle - class couples in which both husband and wife work			1
their double incomes allow them to buy a big house , good schools for their children , more exotic holidays and , crucially , round - the - clock childcare			1
but for governments to adhere to such a distorted mindset does not help the millions of women who do not feel defined by their job — but who care passionately about keeping their relationships and families together			0
by ignoring the wishes of this large group of women , the blinkered feminists — unable to conceive of a world where not all women think like them — make the tough lives of so many mothers even tougher			1
what these feminists seem to have forgotten is that not all women are the same			0
admittedly , some women will always strive to succeed at the highest level — and it is absolutely right that they have the equal opportunity to do so			0
but there are millions of women who , for all sorts of reasons — relating to their life - priorities , wealth and education or social background — have no interest in pursuing a career			1
they simply want to have happy , healthy children ; a supportive , loving husband , and enough money to get by			0
the problem is , however , that as a result of the pressure from modern feminists and their influence on people such as mr @entity120 ( whose high - flying wife once earned an estimated £ 400,000 salary as creative director of an upmarket stationery firm ) , women with more modest , family - oriented ambitions suffer			1
prime minister , @entity120 ( pictured ) , often talks about the importance of marriage and the family while he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single - earner households at the top end of the social ladder , successful working women are invariably supported by an equally well - remunerated husband			1
but at the other end of the social scale , life is very different			0
encouraged by government incentives to go out to work ( for example , given childcare vouchers ) — and , of course , through economic necessity — they feel they have to take a job			0
even if they do n’t want to			0
every morning i see women leave the council estate where i live , to go to work — stopping with a heavy heart at the nursery or child - minder to drop off a young child			2
this is the routine of millions of women all over the country			0
the term feminism , first used in @entity112 in the 1890s , comes from the @entity226 word ‘ feminisme , ’ coined by utopian socialist @entity228			1
there is another side - effect			2
the increase in the number of women at the lower end of the social scale who feel they have to go out to work inevitably means a reduction of the numbers of men in the workplace			0
indeed , all the official statistics show that male unemployment is on the rise			0
as a result , working women — if they have a partner — often return home from work to find an unemployed partner who ’s been kicking his heels at home all day , seething with resentment and low self - esteem			1
not surprisingly , she , in turn , will often seethe — in despair at the lack of gratitude			0
this can easily lead to a downward spiral , with couples much more likely to break up			0
then , sadly , the great risk is that this will damage the couple ’s children , with boys , in particular , suffering at school , experimenting with drugs or drifting into crime			0
and so , in the next generation , male unemployment is the almost inevitable outcome			0
and all this is because of the power of a feminist elite who have relentlessly promoted social policies that sacrifice the values and interests of ordinary and relatively happy family lives in the name of ‘ equal opportunity ’			1
the damage , i fear , they are doing to conventional family life in this country is enormous			2
so what can be done to reverse this ? professor @entity24 ( pictured ) argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women of course , nobody wishes to stop any talented and ambitious woman from achieving at the highest level and it ’s absolutely right that such women compete with men on a truly level playing field			0
but there needs to be an acknowledgement that a woman ’s worth can not be judged solely by the job she does , and that a woman who stays at home to bring up a family is every bit as valuable as other more professionally ambitious women			2
what ’s needed is a major sea - change in thinking , one that acknowledges that men and women are not the same — but also that all women are not the same , either			2
i ’m not saying that those who choose to stay at home should be offered unfair financial inducements to do so — but they should certainly not be punished for doing so			0
yet that ’s exactly what the current tax and benefits system does			0
why , for example , should n’t a stay - at - home mother be able to transfer her personal income tax allowance to her husband and partner , thereby reducing the tax burden on hard - pressed family finances			1
but that should only be a first step			0
since the feminist revolution began in the @entity340 , billions of pounds must have been spent on promoting sexual equality and women ’s role in the workplace			2
the great irony is that its success has resulted , today , with the government worried about levels of male unemployment			2
for the incontrovertible fact is that men are suffering : falling behind women in education ; in the numbers taking up apprenticeships and , increasingly , in the workplace , too			0
this is n’t a development for feminists to crow over ; it ’s a potential social disaster			0
it is a truism that men in work are happier men , and they make better husbands and more attentive fathers			0
i believe that if more men could be helped to find jobs , while more women choose to stay at home , society would benefit with a virtuous circle of happier husbands , happier wives and , of course , happier children			0
but that can only happen if the government — and the feminist elite it seems to be in thrall to — accept that a woman who stays at home and raises children can be every bit as valuable to society as a whole as the woman who goes out to forge a brilliant career .			2

the feminist agenda has been hijacked by the well - educated professionals
middle - class sisterhood judge themselves on success of working lives
@entity112 has become one of the most family - unfriendly countries
