endangered : current estimates suggest a third of the world ’s gorillas and chimpanzees have died from @entity6 since the 1990s there is a side to the @entity6 crisis that , perhaps understandably , has received little media attention : the threat it poses to our nearest cousins , the great apes of @entity15			1
at this moment in time @entity6 is the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and chimpanzees			1
the virus is as deadly for great apes as it is for humans - with mortality rates at approximately 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for chimpanzees			1
current estimates suggest a third of the world ’s gorillas and chimpanzees have died from @entity6 since the 1990s			1
as with humans , these deaths tend to come in epidemics			0
in 1995 , an outbreak is reported to have killed more than 90 per cent of the gorillas in @entity33 in northern @entity34			1
in 2002 - 2003 , a single outbreak of @entity36 - the @entity38 strain of @entity6 - in the @entity38 , killed an estimated 5,000 @entity40 gorillas			1
it ’s hard to accurately count such elusive creatures but the @entity43 estimates there are up to 100,000 left in the wild – so a single @entity6 outbreak wiped out a considerable chunk of the world ’s gorilla population			1
there are of course additional factors behind the declining numbers of @entity15 ’s great apes : illegal trading in wildlife and bushmeat , war , deforestation and other infectious diseases			1
the world ’s remaining wild apes are increasingly being forced into isolated pockets of forest , which impedes their ability to forage , breed and to hide from hunters			1
there is also a growing body of evidence linking deforestation and subsequent changes in climate to the spread of @entity6 and other infectious diseases			2
back in 2003 an article on the decline of great apes , written by a team led by primatologist @entity81 , predicted that without aggressive investments in law enforcement , protected area management and @entity6 prevention , the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction			1
sadly , this prediction appears to have come true			0
since 2008 , the @entity91 has listed the @entity92 as ' endangered ' and the @entity93 as ' critically endangered '			0
cornered : the world ’s remaining wild apes are being increasingly forced into isolated pockets of forest ( illustrated on map ) , which impedes their ability to forage , breed and to hide from hunters if we do not act fast , these may prove to be the last decades in which apes can continue to live in their natural habitat			1
unfortunately , there appears to be a lack of political will to implement policies which would bring viable solutions into effect			0
we need both short - term solutions to halting the spread of @entity6 and long - term ones to prevent future outbreaks			2
as a short - term strategy , vaccination could prove enormously useful in tackling the @entity6 crisis in apes			2
unlike for humans , a vaccine for gorillas and apes has been developed which thus far has been proven both safe and effective			2
chimpanzees learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others , a new study suggests			2
compassionate : a study has found that chimps are able to learn kindness from others scientists claim it ’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers			2
the study seems to offer fresh evidence of the evolutionary roots of kindness in humans and non-human primates			0
researchers from the @entity145 and @entity146 in @entity147 , demonstrated that contrary to earlier findings , in certain conditions , primates display similar behaviour to humans			0
professor @entity152 explained : ‘ a regard for the welfare of others is seen as a cardinal human virtue			0
by contrast , several recent scientific studies have concluded that the same dispositions are lacking in our closest living primate relatives			0
‘ the results of our research provide the first evidence that both children and chimpanzees share common traits of altruism that are learned as a direct result of experiencing the kindness of others			0
’ to date though , these trials have not involved ' challenging ' the vaccinated chimps with the live virus			0
across much of @entity175 , medical research on great apes is either banned or highly restricted because of their cognitive similarity to humans			1
the question is whether or not we should make an exception in this case			0
in the long term , conservation efforts aimed at restoring forest habitat could also help curb the spread of the virus , as larger forested areas would reduce the chances of infected animals coming into contact with one another			0
in tandem with forest regeneration , greater protection for apes from hunters and strict laws to control bushmeat consumption would also be hugely beneficial , both for apes and for humans .			0

@entity203 is deadly for great apes , with mortality rates approximately 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for chimpanzees
current estimates suggest a third of the world ’s gorillas and chimpanzees have died from @entity6 since the 1990s
there are up to 100,000 left in the wild – so a single @entity6 outbreak wipes out a considerable chunk of the world ’s gorilla population
