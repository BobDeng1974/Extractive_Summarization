@entity0 and its @entity2 allies spent billions freeing @entity3 from the evil clutches of @entity5 , but what exactly has replaced him ? @entity9 elections are still some way away , there 's serious unrest in several cities and today a @entity15 report reveal that up to 8,000 pro-gaddafi supporters were being held by militia groups in @entity3			1
human rights commissioner @entity18 claimed they are being held in appalling conditions and are being abused and tortured			1
while @entity22 state that detainees have died after being tortured by militias in detention centres			1
tension : @entity3 's former rebel fighters , at a checkpoint near the town of @entity30			1
the new government says it will strike back if @entity5 supporters were behind deadly clashes in the town			0
their claims were strengthened by allegations of brutality in @entity38 by the aid agency @entity39 , who have pulled out their staff			1
the organisation 's medical staff said they were were being asked to patch up detainees mid-way through torture sessions so they could go back for more abuse			0
the agency said it was in @entity38 , about 130 miles east of the @entity3 capital and scene of some of the fiercest battles in the conflict , to treat war - wounded detainees but was instead having to treat fresh wounds			1
meantime , the @entity15 's mrs @entity18 said the problem was down to militias working outside of government control			0
she added : ' the lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill treatment			2
my staff have received alarming reports that this is happening in places of detention that they have visited			2
' abuse claims : @entity73 says he was tortured at the hands of the @entity76 forces earlier this month			0
his claims support assertions by the @entity15 that torture and violence is widespread general director of @entity82 reinforced the @entity15 assertions and said : ' patients were brought to us in the middle of interrogation for medical care , in order to make them fit for more interrogation			0
our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees , not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions			0
the agency said it has raised the issue with the authorities in @entity38 and with the national army			1
' no action was taken , ' said @entity82			0
' we have therefore come to the decision to suspend our medical activities in the detention centres			1
' rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about torture being used against people , many of them @entity110 , suspected of having fought for @entity5 's forces during @entity3 's nine - month civil war			1
regime change : the @entity15 insist abuses are still commonplace following the fall of @entity3 dictator @entity5 , right			2
while yesterday @entity3 defence minister @entity117 , left , said that the government was control of the country			2
reports of the mistreatment and disappearances of suspected @entity5 loyalists have embarrassed @entity3 's ruling @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , which had vowed to make a break with practices under @entity5 and respect human rights			1
the allegations are also awkward for the @entity131 powers which backed the @entity133 rebellion and helped install @entity3 's new leaders			2
the @entity125 has appealed to its citizens not to carry out reprisals against @entity5 loyalists and it says it will investigate any abuses			0
there was no immediate comment from the @entity125 on the aid agency 's allegations			0
the ability of the government in @entity145 to rein in torture is limited because , in most cases , it is carried out by locally based militias who are outside the @entity125 's chain of command			0
human rights group @entity22 said on thursday it had evidence of several detainees dying after being subjected to torture , including some in @entity38			1
it quoted one man who said he had been tortured earlier this month in the headquarters of @entity38 security forces			2
' they took me for interrogation upstairs			0
five men in plain clothes took turns beating and whipping me , ' @entity22 quoted the man as saying			1
' they suspended me from the top of the door by my wrists for about an hour and kept beating me			0
