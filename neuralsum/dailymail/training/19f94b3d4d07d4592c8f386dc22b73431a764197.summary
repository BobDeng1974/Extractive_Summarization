@entity0 said : ' he 's been waiting for a while to break his duck and been working very hard in training , and now he has scored one in the league i am sure things will start to go his way now			2
' for me it 's always about trying to help players who are here , not just @entity3 , but all the boys who are at the club			2
it 's not easy to settle into a new team , a new area , a new lifestyle , with different people around you and so on and so forth			0
' people do n't ever take that into account			0
i just try to do my bit , although i 'm not taking any credit for him scoring â€“ i 'm just happy he did			0
