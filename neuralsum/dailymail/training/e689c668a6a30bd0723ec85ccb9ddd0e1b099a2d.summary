by @entity0 on christmas eve in 1968 @entity1 provoked outrage among atheists when the @entity5 8 astronauts read from the @entity6 as they orbited the moon			0
so if any people of a similar disposition are reading , look away now - a team based in @entity11 are planning to send the @entity12 to the moon			1
the sacred @entity15 scroll would be sent along with other iconic @entity17 artefacts as part of the @entity19 , a competition amongst private companies to send vehicles to the moon , with the goal of maintaining @entity17 ’s culture in the event of an apocalypse			1
an @entity11 - based team is hoping to send a handwritten version of the @entity12 ( stock image shown ) to the surface of the moon			1
their goal is to hitch a ride with a mission currently competing in the @entity19 , which should see private companies landing on the moon starting at the end of 2015 the project is known as @entity12 on the @entity39 and is based in @entity40			1
the @entity19 , the largest international incentive based prize of all time , is tasking private organisations with safely landing on the surface of the moon			1
' more than half of the world ’s population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface , ' say the organisers			0
the @entity19 aims to create a new ' @entity5 ' moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $ 40 million in incentive based prizes			2
in order to win this money , a private company must land safely on the surface of the moon , travel 500 meters above , below , or on the @entity39 surface , and send back two ' @entity63 ' to @entity17 the team are hoping to send a handwritten @entity15 scroll , the @entity12 , to the lunar surface reports @entity67 , and later the @entity68 ( @entity70 scriptures ) and the @entity71 ( an ancient @entity72 philosophical work )			1
they would each be transported in capsules that would enable them to survive on the moon for more than 10,000 years			1
‘ this is an incredible , beautiful project , ’ said group founder @entity77			0
‘ these three texts are among @entity17 ’s most ancient documents , created over 3,000 years ago			1
‘ they are significant to billions of people			0
’ to fund the mission @entity77 and his team are hoping to raise up to £ 12.1m ( $ 20.5m ) by having scribes write each of the 304,805 characters contained in the @entity12			1
these writers would be funded by believers			0
ultimately , the goal is to ensure a significant part of @entity17 ’s culture would remain on the moon far into the future			1
thus , if @entity17 were to suffer an apocalypse - type event , be it a nuclear war or an asteroid impact , part of humanity ’s legacy would live on			2
the endeavour has been considered before on varying scales , with other agencies and organisations saying humanity should create ‘ time capsules ’ that will preserve @entity17 ’s cultures and societies			2
in fact @entity1 ’s two @entity110 spacecraft , currently on their way into interstellar space , each contain something called the @entity115			0
this vinyl is a collection of various snippets of @entity17 life and culture , from the sounds of nature to images of humans			2
it is intended , if it is ever found , to be a lasting legacy of humanity ’s place in the universe			0
the @entity12 on the @entity39 project had previously hoped to ride to the moon with a lander designed by @entity133 called @entity134 ( artist 's illustration shown ) , but the partnership has since been cancelled			1
this vehicle is designed to ' hop ' across the lunar surface using rockets the prospect of creating a ' time capsule ' of @entity17 life has been considered before , in order to preserve humanity 's legacy in the event of a global catastrophe			1
pictured is an ' @entity151 ' as our planet came into view while @entity154 orbited the moon this particular project , meanwhile , would be hitching a ride on one of several @entity19 missions			1
as yet , though , the team have n’t booked a place on any particular flight			0
it had initially been intended to join a lander that is being built by @entity11 - based @entity134 , but that partnership failed to materialise			1
they are now sounding out the @entity168 - based @entity167 to see if they would be willing to take the artefacts , but there has been no confirmation of an agreement yet			2
another obstacle is to actually create a capsule that can survive the extreme environment on the moon			2
in sunlight the lunar surface can reach a scorching 123 ° @entity179 ) , but at night it plunges to a frigid -173 ° @entity180 )			0
an attempt by @entity182 to make the capsule that would keep the @entity12 safe on the moon failed to withstand this vast temperature swing			2
this would not be the first time religion and space have combined			0
as mentioned earlier , the @entity5 8 astronauts infamously read from the @entity6 as they orbited the moon			0
@entity191 , meanwhile , took communion on the moon before stepping onto the surface in july 1969.and the @entity5 15 astronauts left a bible on their lunar rover when they left the moon in july 1971			0
in 1971 the @entity5 15 astronauts left a @entity198 on their lunar rover ( pictured in the red circle ) when they left the surface of the moon			0
this is one of a handful of instances where religion and space have combined , including @entity191 taking communion on the moon in july 1969			0

an @entity11 - based team is hoping to send the @entity12 to the moon 's surface
the project would hitch a ride on a @entity19 mission
this is a competition for private companies to land a vehicle on the moon
the @entity12 would be put inside a capsule that could survive for 10,000 years
and it would be joined by other important texts in the future to preserve snippets of @entity17 's culture and society in case humanity goes extinct
