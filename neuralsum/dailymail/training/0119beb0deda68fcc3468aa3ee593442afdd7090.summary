by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:36 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 24 august 2012 heard the one about the golf course which banned golf buggies ? or the cafes that refused to heat up baby food ? they might sound like bad jokes , but in fact they are just two of the ten most unjustifiable bans in the often bizarre world of health and safety			1
other examples include a council which stopped a nursery teacher taking children to an allotment , and a manager who banned a woman from wearing flip flops in the office because they did not have enclosed toes and a supported back			1
world gone mad ! cafes refusing to heat up baby food ' in case it burns the child 's mouth ' the list was published by the @entity32 , which says too many middle managers are banning low - risk activities			1
it also accuses companies of using elf ’ n ’ safety as a cover for unpopular , but profitable , policies			2
one example was an airline which said a traveller could not have a blanket on an aeroplane – unless she bought one for £ 5			2
since april the @entity47 , established by the @entity32 , has invited those who believe they are victims of a ludicrous health and safety ruling to email in and get a professional view			1
the panel may then contest decisions made by insurance companies , local authorities and employers			2
all the examples on the list were deemed to be cases where an organisation was using health and safety wrongly , perhaps as a smokescreen for an unpopular decision or poor customer service , or because of a nonsensical interpretation of the law			1
in the golf example , buggies were prohibited because they were not ‘ health and safety authorised ’			0
the cafes that would n’t warm up baby food apparently told the mother they could n’t ‘ in case it burns the child ’s mouth ’			0
yet they were selling hot drinks			0
ridiculous ! campers told they would have to pay for two plots because they had a camper van and a tent ministers have promised reforms of health and safety laws			0
employment minister @entity88 said : ‘ it ’s hugely frustrating when excuses are being made in the name of health and safety			0
@entity94 is helping the man and woman on the street fight back against the jobsworths			0
