by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 15:41 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 16:19 est , 19 november 2012 @entity3 tonight apologised to @entity4 for naming him over false child abuse allegations			1
the 46 - year - old @entity7 comedian wrote to the former @entity9 politician , whose legal team is continuing its process of suing everybody who wrongly linked him to allegations of historic child abuse			1
the claims were sparked by a @entity18 report which did not name @entity4 but referred to a senior conservative from the @entity21 era , leading to his identification online			1
’ it came after the @entity34 and @entity35 star had tweeted : ‘ any clues as to who the @entity9 paedophile is ? ’ and then retweeted a response naming @entity4			1
last week the @entity7 agreed to pay the peer £ 185,000 for wrongly implicating him in a paedophile ring that targeted children at the care home in @entity45 , north @entity46			1
but @entity27 users had already taken to the website to tweet or retweet the libellous allegations			0
@entity50 , the outspoken wife of commons speaker @entity51 , is another @entity27 user who @entity4 's lawyers are considering suing			1
mrs @entity50 wrote on november 4 : ‘ why is @entity4 trending ? * innocent face *			2
’ but she has defended her tweet , describing it as not libellous - ‘ just foolish ’			0
i 'm sorry : mr @entity3 told his 444,000 followers on @entity27 that he had written to @entity4 to apologise then on friday she tweeted : ‘ yes had letter from @entity60			2
his lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [ to be honest ] # bigbullies			2
’ she later added : ‘ i do n’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire			0
lord @entity66 falsely accused but not by me			0
' i 've just written to @entity4 to apologise for retweeting his name in relation to false allegations following a @entity7 investigation ' @entity3 ‘ loving my trial by tabloid , mind			1
i never said @entity4 paedophile – just noted he trending			2
nor did i tweet about * that * @entity18			0
this is totally politically motivated , i tell you			0
and i do n’t do conspiracy theories as a rule			0
’ she went on : ‘ night twitter			0
off to cuddle up with my lovely husband who takes so much * * * * ( often on my behalf ) # poor @entity51 # topspeaker # greatmanontoast			0
’ the peer 's solicitor , @entity83 , has said action will be taken against ‘ a lot of people ’ who linked the former politician 's name with the unfounded allegations			2
he has also previously confirmed that a ‘ very long list ’ of @entity27 users had been compiled which included mrs @entity50 and journalist @entity93 , who has already apologised			0
this was the extraordinary moment @entity98 handed a list of alleged paedophiles to @entity101 - which @entity4 's lawyer says ' destroyed ' his client 's reputation in the process @entity4 is also seeking damages from @entity108 , which sparked fury after this morning presenter @entity110 confronted the prime minister with a list of names of alleged abusers			1
mr @entity110 had found the names on the internet and asked @entity101 if he would investigate			2
the peer 's legal team have said they want more from @entity108 than the £ 185,000 paid by the @entity7			1
' he would be looking for substantially more damages ( from @entity108 ) than the £ 185,000 he got from the @entity7 because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer - funded			1
up to £ 500,000 is what they are looking at ' source close to @entity4 mr @entity83 said the presenter ' embarrassed the prime minister and destroyed the reputation of my client ' and has sent a 15 - page letter to @entity108 encouraging them to settle			1
the former @entity9 treasurer said because the @entity7 is publicly - funded he tempered the claim made against them			1
but because @entity108 is a private company he is looking for a huge damages deal			1
a source close to the peer told @entity137 : ‘ he would be looking for substantially more damages than the £ 185,000 he got from the @entity7 because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer - funded			1
up to £ 500,000 is what they are looking at			0
' lawyers said the @entity4 , pictured , case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in @entity147 legal history the peer ’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘ original ’ tweets and a further 9,000 retweets , which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them			1
' @entity27 is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity ' @entity83 , @entity4 's solicitor about 40 of these potential defendants have so far approached the peer ’s lawyers to apologise			1
mr @entity83 previously warned that tweeters , even those who deleted their accounts or messages , will be contacted so should come forward			0
he added that it was time to clamp down on @entity27 , which allowed people to say ' vile , disgusting ' things			0

’ @entity27 said that information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so			0
it added that to obtain information that is not public – including the full name of the @entity27 user and their address - would require a witness summons , a court order or another valid legal process			0
without any of these , only the @entity27 user ’s id – which could be a pseudonym – and any other information they have willing disclosed will be available			0
@entity4 could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him			2
@entity215 , a privacy lawyer , said : ‘ in the case of @entity4 , the mere seriousness of the libel would mean applying for a court order would be a straightforward application			2
