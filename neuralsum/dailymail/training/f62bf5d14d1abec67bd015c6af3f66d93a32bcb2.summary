the town of @entity1 outlawed dancing in the movie @entity2 , but the kids in @entity5 , @entity6 live with much worse : no electronics			1
that 's because the small town of 149 people lies in the middle of the 13,000 - square mile @entity12			1
scientists use this space to project satellites into space for research , and they ca n't have waves from personal electronic devices interrupting their signals			1
that means no radio , tv , @entity24 , cellphones or bluetooth			1
shh ... @entity5 , @entity6 is home to the largest steerable satellite in the world - and it needs absolute radio silence to do it 's work switch off : @entity24 , cellphones and tv are strictly off limits emergencies only : first responders are the only residents allowed to use the prohibited electronics @entity5 is home to the largest steerable radio telescope in the world - the @entity41			1
it is arguably the most powerful satellite observing space			2
to let the telescope operate without disturbances the town has completely outlawed the use of electronic transmitting devices and a policeman actually patrols the streets looking for wireless signals			2
only first responders are allowed to use radios and there 's only one pay phone			0
residents still have access to the internet , but at the glacial streaming pace dial - up offers			0
just the way they like it : the electronic regulations in @entity5 are scary for most modern people but a select few have been moving there to get away from all the devices @entity68 : the newer residents believe they suffer from @entity70 - a sickness not recognized in the medical community obviously that makes modern life difficult for the residents of the town , but it 's also looked at as a positive by many who began flocking here in the mid- 2000s to get away from all the technology			1
many of these newer residents say that they suffer from @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , a disease not recognized in the medical community			0
people like @entity83 believe that the waves caused by electronic objects make them sick , much like allergies , and that @entity5 is one of the only places they can live and be healthy			2
' life is n't perfect here , ' @entity83 told @entity91			0
' there 's no grocery store , no restaurants , no hospital nearby			0
but here at least , i 'm healthy			0
i 'm not in bead with a headache all the time			0

@entity5 , @entity6 lies in the @entity12 where electronic transmitters are strictly regulated
cellphones , @entity24 , tv and radio are banned so satellites can *gather* *information* from space
some have been flocking to the small town to escape what they believe to be the *dangerous* electronic *wavelengths*
