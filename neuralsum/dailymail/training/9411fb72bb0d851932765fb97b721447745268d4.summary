but he said he needed to ‘ pay competitively ’ to attract and retain the best staff			0
the argument received short shrift yesterday			2

ordinary people will be wondering how on earth a bank which has made such huge losses for six consecutive years can find a penny in bonuses for its bankers , let alone hundreds of millions			0

however , he admitted it would take time to win the public ’s trust			0
‘ we are the least trusted company in the least trusted sector of the economy , ’ he said			0
‘ so the goal of my plan is very simple			0
we have to be a bank that earns your trust			0
