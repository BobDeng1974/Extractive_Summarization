a former bouncer has lost more than 20st in weight - but gained rolls of sagging flesh which now cascade down his body			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , still tips the scales at over 15st - but says that is a ' dream weight ' compared to his previous size			1
he was so large that it cost him his job as a bodyguard			0
aged 34 , when he was at his heaviest - an astonishing 35st 7lb - he could not dress himself or tie his own shoe laces			1
@entity7 weighed an astonishing 35st before he lost weight and was unable to even tie his own shoes @entity7 's 21st stone weight loss has left him with massive folds of excess skin , gaining him the nick name of ' @entity24 man ' in his hometown he said : ‘ sometimes i 'd get work as a bouncer , and all i needed to do was stand in the doorway to keep people out , they could n't budge me			1
’ but the former bouncer said that in the end he knew it was diet or die			0
however , since losing weight , @entity7 , from the @entity36 capital @entity8 , now feels ‘ a different man ’			2
although it is hard for him to look in the mirror because of his skin hanging loose , he said he still owes ' everything ' to the doctor who helped to get him on the diet			2
now he will need a further operation to remove the masses of hanging skin which so torment him			0
plastic surgeon @entity46 ( @entity47 ) says he is already planning the skin operation , but @entity7 is still trying to raise the £ 4,000 needed for the operation ‘ i was reborn			1
from 500lbs to 190lbs ( 35st 7lb to 13st 7lb )			0
i could not run , i needed help to put my shoes on ’ , @entity7 said			2
‘ but i will have to scrape together 5,000 @entity52 ( £ 4,000 ) before i can have the skin removed			1
’ plastic surgeon @entity46 says he is already planning the skin operation			0
‘ at a rough estimate , we will remove 8 - 10lbs of tissue and a skin surface of three square feet , given that the entire surface of the body is 20 - 25 square feet for an adult of average weight and height			2
that is 10 - 20 per cent of the total area , ’ the doctor said			0
‘ because it is a very delicate surgery , there are risks , ’ he added , saying it needed to be done carefully .			0
