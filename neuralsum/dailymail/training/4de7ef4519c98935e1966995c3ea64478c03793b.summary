you 've no doubt seen countless images of the universe , complete with rainbow - coloured galaxies and nebulae			1
but do these breathtaking cosmic entities really exist as they are presented ? the simple answer is ' no '			0
images of objects deep in space are more often than not subjected to a great deal of processing to transform what looks like a featureless night sky to the naked eye into a explosion of hues			2
amateur astronomer @entity17 revealed the techniques used in a @entity20 video , using an image of the @entity22			1
an amateur astronomer has explained in a video how @entity31 enhances images of space to reveal features and details that would otherwise be hidden to the human eye			1
for example , some colours can highlight certain gases and elements the image above may just look like a generic snapshot of the night sky , but hidden in the data is in fact an enormous nebula spanning most of the picture , as revealed in the video			1
indeed , if you were able to travel to the nebula , you may be disappointed			0
none of the gases would be visible to the naked human eye			0
the features made of dust and gas , as shown in the processed images , are actually there – but the human eye is simply not sensitive to the wavelengths of light they emit			0
only through manipulating the image can an invisible nebula 's features be revealed - a ' trick ' @entity31 employs to enhance its images of the cosmos			1
mr @entity17 explained the methods that take place to reveal hidden cosmic features , with colours highlighting some of the details and features that would otherwise be invisible to us			2
that 's because our eyes are limited in the wavelengths they can see ; we are only sensitive to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum			0
telescopes and cameras are more advanced , though , and they can be used to reveal light in other wavelengths , from x-rays to infrared			0
in his video , mr @entity17 collected data from the @entity88 on 1 december 2014 from the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91			2
he took the image using a @entity94 camera attached to a telescope , and creating the image using @entity97 1.8			2
the video begins with a very ordinary - looking shot of the night sky , complete with thousands of stars , and no discernible nebula in the image			1
but a method called ‘ stretching ’ then reveals the nebula hidden in the darkest parts of the image			1
- to depict how an object might look to us if our eyes were as powerful as @entity110			2
- to visualise features of an object that would ordinarily be invisible to the human eye			0
- to bring out an object 's subtle details			0
on @entity116 , mr @entity17 explained what this process entails			0
he said if each pixel was said to have a value from 0 to 255 , the entire nebula would be in the region 0 to 50 - not visible to the human eye			0
‘ stretching is taking that 0 to 50 and mapping it across 0 to 255 so that the bright parts of the nebula are the bright parts of the image , ’ he said			2
after stretching the image , he performs some ' noise reduction ' to rid the image of superfluous data and then adds some colour to the image , with different colours corresponding to different gases and elements			1
he then reduces the sizes of some of the stars so they do n’t block the view of the nebula , before improving the contrast and creating the final image			0
this image shows the intermediate spiral galaxy @entity148 before ( left ) and after ( right ) colour is added to the image to highlight some of its key features one of @entity31 's most famous images is the @entity154			1
on the left is one of three black and white images that were combined to create the final colour version on the right the @entity110 , pictured , uses electronic detectors rather than film like a regular camera to take images of the universe , so data on the images is added after they have been ' taken ' the technique he described is very similar to how @entity31 makes its own amazing images			1
as explained by @entity31 , @entity110 records light from the universe with electronic detectors , rather than a film like a regular camera			1
the colour is then added at a later date			0
‘ the colours in @entity110 images , which are assigned for various reasons , are n't always what we 'd see if we were able to visit the imaged objects in a spacecraft , ’ @entity31 said on their @entity110 website			1
‘ we often use colour as a tool , whether it is to enhance an object 's detail or to visualise what ordinarily could never be seen by the human eye			0

an amateur astronomer took a picture of a nebula from @entity91
at first *glance* there is nothing of note in the image - just some stars
but manipulating the image reveals a ' hidden ' nebula in the data
@entity31 uses this processing method to bring out features in its images
for example , some colours can highlight certain gases and elements
the @entity110 telescope uses detectors to gather data from *distant* objects , rather than taking images like a *conventional* camera
