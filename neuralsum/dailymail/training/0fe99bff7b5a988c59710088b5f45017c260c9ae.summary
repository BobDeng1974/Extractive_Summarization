by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 26 november 2013 an exclusive @entity2 lounge reserved for the airline 's first class passengers has been found to have questionable standards when it comes to food hygiene and safety			1
despite the promise of the ‘ @entity14 and @entity15 ‘ at @entity13 offering ‘ an exclusive a la carte menu with an emphasis on the freshness and quality of ingredients ' , when it comes to cleanliness , passengers may have been better off eating from a burger van or kebab shop			1
in the latest food safety inspection , the lounge which is reserved for the airline 's most valuable customers , received a score of 2 out of 5 being awarded , placing the venue in the bottom 10 % of all food establishments in @entity31			1
it looks nice : but would you want to eat here ? the @entity35 awarded the @entity14 ( pictured ) at @entity13 a two out of five for food safety flying low : @entity2 's exclusive @entity14 scored a miserable 2 out of 5 when it came to food safety			1
it places the establishment in the bottom 10 % of all food places in @entity31 with pubs and even greasy burger vans performing better the findings were published online by the @entity35 although there is now a @entity46 request to reveal the full details of the inspection			1
@entity2 describes the lounges as providing an ‘ exceptional experience ’ and ‘ outstanding food ’			2
it advertises the @entity52 as being the ‘ epitome of elegance ’ , inspired by ‘ the finest five - star boutique hotels ’			0
a @entity2 spokeswoman told @entity57 ‘ we work with @entity59 to provide a high quality service to customers using our lounges , and take all feedback seriously			2
‘ we continue to invest in our product and are currently renovating our kitchen facilities			0
’ however , the airline was unable to provide any clear explanation for the poor levels of hygiene revealed in its most recent food safety inspection conducted less than two months ago , at the peak of the summer holidays			1
not good enough : the findings by the @entity75 on the @entity76 are clear for all to see @entity59 have released a statement concerning the poor results they received			2
' we are very disappointed with the results of the audit by @entity82 of the @entity84 and @entity76 kitchen			0
we would like to acknowledge that a score of 2 is not acceptable to us and we apologise to our customers and @entity2 for the management failures that contributed to this score			2
we had already taken immediate remedial action based on the points highlighted verbally during the inspection of july 29th			0
all specific management failings were rectified immediately and we continue to monitor our performance rigorously			0
@entity59 and @entity2 have been working on a plan to renovate the lounge kitchens to ensure we can deliver a product to meet the high standards required by both companies and to cope with increasing demand			2
' the statement goes onto mention an extensive renovation of the @entity103 lounge kitchens including upgraded storage facilities and new equipment is now underway and will be completed by the end of october			2
staff are also being retrained in food hygiene skills			0
unhappy fliers : there has been disquiet amongst loyal ranks of @entity2 fliers since a new catering company , @entity59 , took over at the start of 2013 although there have been no reports of any passengers becoming ill from the low levels of hygiene found in the @entity123 lounges , the food safety ratings are designed to help the public make an informed decision			1
the food hygiene rating or inspection result given to a particular business reflects the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection with venues being graded on a six - point scale from zero to five			1
crash landing : @entity138 's ' @entity137 ' which also operates in @entity13 at @entity136 scored ' 2 ' as well in the most recent inspection a poor performance can be as a result of any number of factors including bad refrigeration , food cross contamination , poor hand - washing , poor food rotation and poor temperature control			1
many school canteens and hospital kitchens receive a ' 5 ' grading , as do supermarket and office staff canteens			0
the lounges were n't the only venue scoring below par in the most recent @entity13 inspection			0
@entity138 's ' @entity137 ' restaurant also scored a 2 during a survey earlier this year , along with a branch of @entity161 in the terminal			1
the airline can take some comfort from the fact its other lounges at @entity136 scored top marks with the @entity2 ' terminal 3 lounge receiving 5 out of 5 along with another @entity170 lounge based in @entity13 , albeit both were assessed prior to @entity59 taking over the catering operation			1
lounges operated by @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and many others also scored well during the latest round of inspections			0
the firm which provides food for the lounge , @entity59 , has been ordered to make improvements by the @entity35			1
it was rated as ‘ poor ’ in the category of food hygiene and safety			1
poor is classed as ‘ some major non-compliance with statutory obligations – more effort required to prevent fall in standards ’			0
the firm , co-founded and chaired by @entity196 @entity195 , won a five - year contract to run catering the lounge , which includes the @entity52 , in january			1
negative feedback : comments posted in guest books in the airline lounges are clear that all is not well amongst the ranks of @entity2 's highest - paying passengers and most loyal customers in a separate issue , the latest findings may come as no surprise to frequent @entity2 travellers who claim they have seen the quality of offerings provided by the exclusive lounge decline dramatically in recent months an apparent bid to cut costs			1
a number of blogs have even been created that chart the demise in the quality of food being offered to the airlines ’ most loyal members			2
before and after photos on @entity225 show how once - appetising buffet food has been replaced by something more akin to school dinners			0
one blogger compared how things had changed writing : ‘ it was a typical buffet , not amazing quality food but was adequate when you just needed something quick to eat			2
now things are particularly poor			0
just random trays of things in liquids , often all the meat gets fished out and you end up with trays full of sauce			0
’ another frequent flier told @entity57 , ‘ frankly , this is appalling			0
the @entity170 used to be something fliers aspired to access - the @entity245 of aviation lounges			0
hearing about such poor levels of hygiene makes me want to pack my own sandwich before a flight			0
at least i know it will be clean ! ’ gold standard ? the lounge is reserved for those frequent fliers who have access and those traveling on the most expensive business and first class @entity2 tickets to fly , to serve : loyal @entity2 customers are left wondering whether they 'd want the airline serving them any kind of food after the latest food safety inspection results one passenger commented : ‘ the items on offer were all sauce based dishes which resembled gloop			1
’ even the airlines ’ most dedicated frequent fliers were outraged in the decline in the quality of food being provided in what is considered to be the airlines ’ flagship lounge			1
many have left their thoughts known in the airline 's lounge guest books , usually filled with praise and compliments			2
‘ @entity287 ! not a decent place to sit , you should be ashamed ! ’ wrote one passenger			0
‘ i would have been better off waiting in the monkey enclosure at @entity290 ’ agreed another			0
‘ please change your catering company asap ! ’ food for thought : on blogs , online forums and even guest books placed with the airline 's own lounge , very few positive comments can be found			1

@entity35 gave flagship lounge a rating of 2 out of 5 for ' food safety '
it places the exclusive ' @entity14 ' in the bottom 10 % of all food establishments
@entity309 usually reserved for first class passengers and some gold card *holders*
decline of quality of catering *widely* *documented* since the start of the year
@entity138 's restaurant at the same terminal was also rated ' poor '
