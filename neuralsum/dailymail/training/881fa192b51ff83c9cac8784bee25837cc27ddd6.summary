the cavalry can not come soon enough for @entity6 and @entity7			2
it is one point from six now , and a rather spawny one at that			0
@entity11 were the better team			2
not just in terms of chances , but in the technical fields , too			0
they knew what they were about , they executed the manager ’s plan , they were physically dominant			0
their weakness , as ever , was in front of goal			0
still , it was only as the game became ragged near the end that @entity7 looked dangerous			2
they are a shadow right now ; a shadow of themselves , and of a team with @entity35 ambitions			0
heads up : @entity11 midfielder @entity36 ( third from right ) rises highest to head his side back on level terms at the @entity4 unstoppable : @entity36 's header beats @entity7 goalkeeper @entity41 ( left ) and finds the bottom corner to get @entity11 level pure passion : former @entity45 man @entity36 grabs the @entity11 badge on his shirt after grabbing his first goal for the club mobbed : @entity36 celebrates in front of the home fans as he 's congratulated by team - mates @entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) down in the dumps : @entity7 trio ( from left to right ) @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 look glum after @entity36 's equaliser @entity11 : @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 8.5 , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity62 5.5 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 8 , @entity36 6.5 ( @entity65 63 , 6 ) , @entity66 7.5 ( @entity67 79 ) , @entity68 6.5 ( @entity69 76 , 6 ) , @entity70 7			1

@entity7 have debilitating nerves at the back and the forwards are struggling to make the most of a pretty ordinary supply line			1
they were n’t outclassed by @entity11 , but in a pedestrian second half , the best chance fell to @entity109 ’s team when @entity80 blocked a @entity70 shot - after a bit of ball juggling - on its way to goal			1
that substitute @entity79 had made a hash of a straight - forward defensive manoeuvre to allow the chance was par for the course			0
at the back , @entity7 are an accident waiting to happen these days			2
@entity120 will be in the starting line - up soon — @entity122 really can not afford delay , once the red tape has been snipped - and maybe @entity125 if @entity7 can pull off this summer ’s marquee signing from @entity127			1
whether an @entity129 winger solves the biggest problem here is doubtful , with a defensive overhaul so long overdue			0
@entity122 may argue that invention is just as pressingly required , though			2
@entity60 , @entity11 ’s goalkeeper , was rarely called into action and the best of it was a 50 - 50 with @entity84 , which the @entity11 man won , impressively			1
@entity84 had earlier been booked for diving , so not everything at @entity7 has changed since sir @entity140 left			1
the bottom - line problem for @entity122 ’s defence right now is this : whatever route to goal the opposition take , they look vulnerable			1
ball in the air — vulnerable ; ball down the flanks — certainly vulnerable ; ball through the middle — vulnerable ; half - assed misplaced pass that any @entity155 centre half would mop up in his sleep — surprisingly , still vulnerable			2
@entity11 soon worked out that their approaches to the @entity7 goal did not have to be of any grand quality			1
get it up there and let @entity7 ’s jitters do the rest			2
easy finish : @entity7 midfielder @entity57 ( third from left ) arrives at the back post to put his side 1 - 0 up after 17 minutes back of the net : @entity11 goalkeeper @entity60 ( left ) looks dejected as @entity57 's shot nestles in his net during the first half man of the moment : @entity174 international @entity57 runs off to celebrate his first goal of the season against @entity109 's @entity11 get in ! @entity57 gestures towards @entity7 's travelling supporters after celebrating his strike with ( from left to right ) @entity68 , @entity80 and @entity84 @entity57 's goal arrived after a neat passing move which began with goalkeeper @entity41 giving him the ball , as the graphic below shows - click here for more in our brilliant @entity185 nor can the blame be laid solely on the 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
defenders of this reputation — and expense — should not be exposed by what is one of the more common tactical variations			0
@entity122 is probably mystified at the limitations of what is , with the exception of @entity81 at right wing - back , an @entity200 defence			1
it is no great surprise that @entity84 looks as comfortable at left wing - back as he would sitting on a spike , but @entity72 and @entity78 are @entity206 internationals , supposedly part of the national team ’s rebuilding programme with youth at its heart			1
it is worrying to see them so devoid of confidence when faced with new ideas			0
also missing is the certainty that accompanied a @entity7 opening goal			1
@entity218 was , if this team took a single goal lead at @entity11 , victory could almost be presumed			1
controversy : @entity85 ( left ) goes down in the @entity11 box after a joint tackle from @entity64 ( centre ) and @entity61 ( right ) penalty ? @entity7 winger @entity84 was shown a yellow card for simulation after going down in the box after this challenge from @entity54 going down : @entity84 appeared shocked after referee @entity94 booked him after this incident with former @entity7 defender @entity54 @entity58 spent most of his time on the ball on @entity7 's left side , as his @entity234 below shows - click here for more stats and graphics in our @entity185 on sunday , when @entity57 put @entity7 ahead against the run of play after 17 minutes , the presumption was of a @entity11 equaliser , most likely before half - time			1
in the end it took just 13 minutes			0
that the goal belonged to @entity36 was another fillip for @entity109 ’s side			1
attempting to rebuild his career after several wilderness years at @entity45 , @entity36 had a difficult debut against @entity251 last weekend			2
this was not greatly convincing , either , at first , but his equalising header changed that and , from there , his performance grew			0
by the time he was taken off after 63 minutes — match fitness is still an issue — he looked much more like his old @entity260 self			0
his goal was impressively taken , even if @entity7 ’s marking left much to be desired — like , well , marking really			2
@entity63 whipped in the corner from the right and @entity36 lost @entity56 to rise high and give @entity41 no chance from close range			1
it was a clever run , almost stopping near the end , to trick the @entity268 , and @entity109 ’s reaction suggested he enjoyed it , too			0
he waved his arms furiously to encourage the crowd into making more noise			0
after @entity7 ’s goal the stadium had fallen surprisingly quiet			2
back in action : @entity85 ( left ) gets away from @entity11 's @entity63 ( right ) during his first game back after the @entity278 in @entity279 room for improvement : @entity7 manager @entity6 looks on from the bench alongside his assistant @entity283 under pressure : @entity11 striker @entity70 ( left ) controls the ball as @entity7 midfielder @entity83 ( right ) closes him down getting physical : @entity7 striker @entity58 ( right ) is held back by @entity11 midfielder @entity63 ( left ) at the @entity4 mins @entity286 @entity11 total 113.2 70.3 @entity63 90 11.8 7.3 @entity64 90 11.4 7.1 @entity61 90 10.9 6.8 @entity7 total 111.7 69.4 @entity57 90 12.6 7.8 @entity287 90 11.6 7.2 @entity84 90 11.0 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity289 , the @entity290 of the @entity291 no doubt that was due to the injustice of the scoreline			1
until that moment it had been all @entity11 , @entity7 rarely venturing to the opposition penalty area			1
then , from their first attack of note , a goal			0
@entity81 sped down the right and hit a low cross which eluded @entity11 ’s back line , and was tapped in by @entity57 at the far post			1
at first , it seemed as if @entity63 might have got the final touch , but his despairing lunge was merely the act of a man over-compensating for losing his runner			0
no wonder the home fans stood nonplussed			0
they were probably wondering how @entity7 had reached this infant stage without conceding			0
as early as the second minute , a quite hopeless backpass by @entity84 had almost allowed @entity70 to put @entity313 in , and three minutes later another defensive mess ended with @entity64 shooting just wide			2
@entity66 , making his full debut following a transfer from @entity109 ’s old club @entity317 , was giving @entity84 a troubling time on the flank and in the 16th minute he set up what should have been a @entity11 goal			1
his break bamboozled three covering @entity7 players — not hard , there were times when one felt they could be taken in by the old penny - behind - the - ear gag — and he struck a perfect pass into the path of @entity70			2
his finish was dismal , however , straight at @entity77			0
the home fans seemed happy enough at the end , but they may one day come to view this as a missed opportunity			0
all the best individual performances were from the home team — @entity61 exceptional , @entity64 breaking up play superbly — and if @entity11 had more about them around @entity7 ’s box they would undoubtedly have won			1
it will not be like this once those reinforcements arrive			0
surely ? interested spectator : former @entity7 manager sir @entity140 ( right ) takes his seat as he prepares to watch his old side in action not good enough : but sir @entity140 could not hide his disappointment as the club he lifted to the summit of @entity200 football put in a sorry display at the @entity4 safe hands : @entity122 's @entity353 gets down low to stop an effort at goal from former @entity356 forward @entity70 ( left ) getting dark : clouds hover above the @entity4 as a full house watch @entity11 and @entity7 do battle on sunday afternoon animated : @entity11 boss @entity109 gives instructions to his players during a feisty encounter against @entity122 's men my ball ! @entity58 ( right ) challenges @entity11 's on - loan defender @entity61 ( left ) for the ball during a frustrating opening period for the striker			1

@entity57 gave @entity7 the lead on 17 minutes with a simple finish into an empty net
but @entity36 scored his first goal for the @entity11 to make it 1 - 1 during the first - half
@entity56 returned to the @entity381 ' starting @entity382 for the first time since the @entity278
@entity84 was booked for diving following a challenge from @entity54
@entity122 's men now have just a single point from their opening two games
