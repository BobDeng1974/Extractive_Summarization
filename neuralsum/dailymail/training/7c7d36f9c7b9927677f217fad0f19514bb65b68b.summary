mr @entity128 said that while the offences were based on sexual activity , he stressed that his client had been charged with fraud only and that the young men had entered into the agreements voluntarily			2
@entity42 knew that if he continued to behave in such a way then he would spend large parts of his adult life in custody , mr @entity128 said			0
