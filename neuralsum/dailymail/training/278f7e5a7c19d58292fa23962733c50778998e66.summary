by @entity1 reporter published : 00:31 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 31 july 2013 @entity2 will be taking a long vacation from her role as @entity6 ’s right - hand woman next month to ‘ support her family ’ during husband @entity10 ’s mayoral campaign			1
though the official line is that @entity2 has long had this vacation in the works , it comes just as @entity10 ’s campaign has taken a huge dive amid revelations of the former congressman ’s continued sexting			1
the break from helping @entity21 transition into private life may not help @entity2 find privacy of her own , though , as @entity10 ’s @entity24 seems content to continue publicly shaming the serial sexter and just after @entity2 was spotted dining with a top @entity21 aide			1
time off : @entity10 's wife @entity2 will be taking a long vacation from her role as @entity6 's right - hand - woman as her husdand 's campaign continues to unravel ‘ @entity2 is not taking a leave of absence , ’ a @entity10 campaign source told @entity34			1
‘ but she will be taking vacation time in august to support her family during @entity10 ’s campaign			1
she had always intended to do this			0
’ the vacation comes as @entity6 ’s dance card for the summer dwindles down to nothing and she and @entity43 head to @entity44 for the month of august			0
@entity34 ’s sources insist that , with the mayoral primary reaching the home stretch , @entity2 wanted to be with @entity10 and their 18 - month - old son @entity48			2
why now ? the official line from the @entity10 campaign is that @entity2 has long had the vacation scheduled , though it comes at a conspicuous time for the campaign @entity2 was a major focus of coverage of her husband beginning the moment she approached the podium to speak on july 23 after a website released screenshots of highly sexual interactions between @entity10 and political blogger @entity24			1
@entity2 maintained at the time that she would stand by @entity10 in spite of his renewed scandal			2
she has n’t spoken publicly on the matter since			0
she also failed to appear in a recent campaign ad released by @entity10			2
family time : @entity2 intends to take the time to help her family during her husband 's campaign , but what form that help will take is not known some say @entity21 insider @entity75 had a hand in her decision not to support her husband by appearing in the ad			1
whose image @entity75 was concerned about , @entity2 ’s or @entity6 ’s , is unclear			0
also unclear is how @entity2 will , exactly , be supporting her family during her long holiday			2
as @entity24 makes the media rounds , with catty appearances on @entity84 and rumors she ’ll be appearing in a pornographic film , @entity10 certainly has his hands full			0
perhaps her role will be as counselor to her husbands it becomes more and more clear that her support ca n’t save his flagging campaign			0
she hinted the help may not be political by choosing not to appear in a recent ad for the @entity10 campaign			0
here , she dines with @entity21 insider @entity75 , who may have counseled her to stay out of the ad			0

@entity2 *plans* to spend august to ' support her family ' during @entity10 's campaign
though not a ' leave of absence , ' the vacation comes at a conspicuous time for @entity21 's transition office chief
