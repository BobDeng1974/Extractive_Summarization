@entity0 have offered @entity1 huge financial incentives in the hope they will help the controversial striker fulfil his potential at @entity6			1
after @entity0 agreed a £ 16million fee with @entity8 and held a string of positive meetings with @entity11 , the player ’s agent , @entity1 flew into @entity13 on friday night for his medical and to meet @entity0 manager @entity14 face - to - face for the first time			1
hundreds of @entity0 fans cheered him when he finally left the training ground , leaving him in no doubt he will be warmly welcomed at @entity22 all goes well , the @entity18 striker will sign a three - year deal , worth £ 85,000 - £ 90,000 per week			1
but there is also a bonus element worked to the contract that will see him rewarded if he reaches certain targets and does not step out of line			0
should @entity1 stay out of trouble , @entity0 have the option to add a year to his contract			1
@entity14 refused questions on @entity1 at his press conference but insisted that the hard - working environment he has built up during the past two years is strong enough to welcome any new individual into the fold			1
‘ character is very important so no player would come in here if i felt it could n’t work , ’ @entity14 said			2
‘ it ’s not just the coaching element			0
i always look at people as well — if i can help the person then it ’s something i ’ll look at			0
‘ people who know me well will tell you that i try to develop the player and the person			0
if i feel that someone cares enough , i will give them everything			0
incoming : @entity1 is heading to @entity0 to complete his £ 16m move from @entity8 rules : @entity0 manager @entity14 insists @entity1 will follow the club 's strict code of conduct on his way : @entity1 climbs into his @entity80 at his home in @entity82 as he makes his way to @entity0 ‘ we have a culture that creates the talents and gives them the opportunity to blossom			1
nothing will ever stand in the way of that			0
as long as they show they care , want to learn and develop , we can give them the opportunity			0
’ the @entity1 move represents a u-turn after @entity14 said emphatically on august 4 in @entity98 that the former @entity99 forward would not come to @entity0			1
but having been constantly frustrated when pursuing other targets — @entity101 failed a medical , a move to take @entity103 for a season would have cost more than £ 20m , while @entity105 is now being considered — @entity14 had another look at what @entity1 might offer			1
the @entity108 has always admired @entity1 ’s ability but once negotiations began — @entity0 initially enquired about taking him on loan — it became apparent there was significant value to be had from a forward with his ability			1
how is was : @entity1 playing against @entity0 in the colours of @entity99 back in august 2012 international duty : @entity1 in action for @entity18 against @entity120 at the @entity121 this summer @entity14 said : ‘ where i ’m at with building the club , if we thought we were bringing in a player we felt was a risk ... well , two years ago i could n’t have done it as the environment was n’t created			1
‘ what we have here now is a culture of people working very hard , an infrastructure that ’s set up to flourish			0
if you come into that and you ’re not that ( type of ) character it would be really difficult for you			0
‘ this is a club that ’s not like many others			0
this is a strong family club , with values and ethics that run over many years			0
‘ sometimes you have to take a risk with people and a lot of the time if you take that risk you can get a reward for it			0
’ if there is a late hitch , @entity0 would turn to @entity105 and , as a precaution , they sent a medical team to @entity153 yesterday to run tests on the @entity156 striker			1
as it stands , though , @entity1 is likely to be confirmed as a @entity0 player over the weekend			2
his squad number is yet to be decided but both 45 — the one he has favoured throughout his career — and 7 , @entity0 ’s most iconic shirt , are available			2
if @entity14 is relishing the chance to work with @entity1 , @entity99 manager @entity162 was rather more cryptic about a player who helped @entity99 win the title in 2011 - 12			1
‘ i know the character of @entity1 , ’ said @entity162			2
‘ if @entity0 decide he is the player that is important for them , perfect for them and perfect for @entity1			2
‘ it is not my duty to analyse what happened here when he was a @entity99 player			2

@entity14 said £ 16m signing @entity1 will *adhere* to same set of rules as all other @entity0 players
