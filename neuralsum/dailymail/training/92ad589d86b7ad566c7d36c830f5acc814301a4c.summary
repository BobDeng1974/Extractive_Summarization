by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is set to miss sunday 's @entity4 clash with @entity5 , after suffering yet another injury setback			1
the injury - prone @entity8 midfielder missed almost the entirety of last season with a knee problem , making his only appearance in their final game against @entity15 , and looked set to a return to the first - team fold			1
he returned for the @entity18 in their first pre-season friendly against @entity20 in july , but is believed to have picked up the hip problem during their @entity23 game against @entity24			2
but it now appears certain that he will miss the curtain - raiser at @entity41 , and there is also no reported timescale on his comeback			0
@entity2 is currently @entity8 's longest - serving player , having signed for the club in january 2006 , but a succession of injury problems have limited him to just 179 appearances in that time - and just 21 in the last three seasons			0
unlucky : the midfielder has suffered from a string of injuries that have limited his appearances over the years			0
