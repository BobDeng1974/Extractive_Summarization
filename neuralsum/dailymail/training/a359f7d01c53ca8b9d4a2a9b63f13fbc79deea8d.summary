it had been a humdrum press conference , the like of which are common during pre-season , when suddenly a topic arose to make @entity6 bristle			1
‘ how will @entity9 cope without @entity10 ? ’ came the question from the floor			1
@entity6 , whose side had just beaten @entity12 1 - 0 on sunday night in @entity13 , fixed an icy glare on his inquisitor			1
nothing riles him more than the inference @entity9 were a one - man band last season and nothing will give him greater satisfaction than to retain his team ’s vibrancy and potency without the forward who has departed for @entity26 scroll down to see @entity28 eyes @entity30 trophy @entity31 - quick : @entity28 will be crucial to @entity9 's title chances , according to @entity6 in action : the @entity35 winger made his first appearance for the club against @entity12 on sunday video new @entity9 signing eyes @entity30 trophy ‘ what do i see when i look at the team ? ’ said @entity6 ( right )			1
‘ i see players who scored 70 goals last season			0
@entity10 is not a @entity9 player any more , so we do n’t need to talk about him			1
when we did n’t have @entity10 , we scored goals			1
that wo n’t be an issue			0
’ so how will he do it ? the first true glimpse of what @entity9 will be like without @entity10 arrived in @entity13 and will be seen again tomorrow night here in @entity55 , when they lock horns with @entity58 in the @entity60 tournament			1
speed is what @entity6 feels @entity9 need ; jet - heeled wingers like @entity28 and @entity64 , swapping and interchanging from the flanks , charging at defenders and creating chances for @entity68			1
@entity6 deployed a 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 formation in @entity13 , different to last year ’s 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 model , with @entity73 and another new boy , @entity70 , positioned just ahead of @entity69			1
the aim will be for @entity9 to swarm all over their opponents , blitzing them with devastating counter-attacks			1
‘ you look at young @entity28 and @entity64 , the pace of @entity68 , ’ @entity6 continued			1
‘ we have great variety in our attack , full of pace and trickery			2
‘ we have got people , like @entity28 , who can beat defenders			1
i hope it will be another stand - out season for quality and entertainment			0
’ crucial : and the pace of @entity64 will be important step up : @entity68 's form in front of goal will be vital in the efforts to replace the goals of @entity10 age : @entity98 : @entity99 , @entity100 : attacking midfielder @entity103 clubs : @entity104 ( 2011 - 13 ) , @entity105 ( 2013 - 14 )			1
total club appearances 114total club goals 21 @entity108 @entity109 2010 - 11 , 2011 - 12 , 2012 - @entity110 2013 - @entity111 de @entity112 2013 - @entity113 2013 - 14 @entity114 caps @entity115 – february 28 , 2012 : 2 - 0 v @entity116 @entity64 scored the only goal against @entity12 but @entity28 , a £ 20million signing from @entity105 , caught the eye on his debut — one direct surge , memorably , tied two defenders up in knots — and he built on the impression he had made during training at @entity126 in @entity127			2
already a @entity35 international , the 20 - year - old is regarded as one of the most promising young players in @entity132			0
@entity6 has been raving about him since he arrived on @entity134 and with reason : consider these views , for instance , from @entity138 , @entity105 ’s sporting director			2
‘ @entity28 likes to take risks and attack , ’ @entity138 explained			2
‘ he is very cold blooded when he ’s in a one - to - one situation and he ’s not afraid of facing the opponents			0
he ’s eager to learn , so i think he will adapt quickly			0
he is a pure talent			0
’ if it clicks as @entity6 envisages , the amount of chances @entity9 create will not dwindle			1
should that be the case @entity68 , whose role in the team is even more crucial in the @entity150 era , will be the man to profit			0
defiant : @entity6 is certain that his team can challenge again this season farewell : but the former @entity9 forward will be missed following his move to @entity155 ‘ the manager has signed young , exciting players , up - and - comers as they call them , ’ said @entity68			1
‘ we are going to have a winning mentality and the ambition to move forward			0
we will be an exciting squad that plays attacking football			0
that ’s the @entity9 way			2
‘ we are a young squad looking to put our stamp down in the @entity30 and @entity132 as well			0
' we will try to move forward as a squad with a great manager behind us who has the exact same mentality			2
he is hungry for success			0
’ if this is a big season for @entity9 , as they strive to show that charge for the title was not a flash in the pan , the same can be said of @entity68			2
can he reproduce the 21 league goals he scored last time ? ‘ this is a huge club with a lot of players who can step up , ’ @entity68 replied			0
‘ i would n’t say it ’s by default that i ’m the main man			0
@entity10 has left and that is football , he ’s moved on but he ’s doing it for himself and his family			2
as a team we will move forward , i would n’t say i ’m the main man			0
we are going to do our best to move forward			0
