these dramatic photographs capture the moment seven unexploded shells were detonated out at sea			1
the 40lb shells , which are believed to date from the 1860s , were sniffed out by a black @entity5 named after sir @entity6 - the inventor of the bouncing bomb			1
his owner , @entity8 , phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in @entity14 , @entity15 , on sunday			1
they were taken out into the sea where they were safely detonated			1
mr @entity8 said it was not the first time his dog had found explosives			2
he said : ' these are not the first he has found			0
' ' the seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb @entity38 shells			2
' the first one was found by my black @entity40 and the others were then located by the local @entity43 , assisted by @entity6 again			1
' mr @entity8 named his dog after sir @entity6 , a @entity45 aviation engineer who invented the ' bouncing bomb ' used in the @entity47 of 1943			1
@entity48 , 43 , who lives nearby , said : ' the explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast			2
' it 's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after @entity6 - an amazing coincidence really			1
' uncovered : bomb disposal experts arrived and , with @entity6 ' help , found another six shells on the beach curious : owner @entity8 said the shells , pictured , are not the first to be dug up by his pet sir @entity6 : inventor of the ' bouncing bomb ' @entity6 was a @entity45 aviation engineer who is famous for designing the ' bouncing bomb ' that was used in the @entity47 of 1943			1
born in @entity66 , @entity6 worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft			1
when the @entity69 began , @entity6 was assistant chief designer of aviation at @entity72 ' engineering			2
he came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter 's marbles across a tub of water by catapault			1
but it took more than a year to convince @entity82 chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted			2
once he was given the go - ahead , he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design			0
the final solution , called @entity87 , was a cylindrical bomb , weighing four tons , spinning backwards at 500 rpm			0
it had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph			0
in the middle of hilly , forested west @entity95 territory			0
@entity47 , dubbed the ' @entity47 ' was carried out overnight on the 16 may 1943 by the @entity96 of the @entity82 - specially - created for the job - that was led by @entity98			0
two of the dams were breached , leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area			0
however , it did not make a significant dent in the country 's industrial production , as hoped			0
the most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving @entity111 troops , and those left at home , a much - needed boost			0
mission : lancaster bombers ( pictured in file image ) dropped the ' bouncing bombs ' in the @entity47			0

first shell was sniffed out by @entity5 on beach at @entity14 , @entity15
the dog , named @entity6 , helped bomb disposal experts find six more
his *namesake* invented the ' bouncing bomb ' used in @entity130 raids
shells were detonated out at sea and the explosions captured in photos
