a 10 tonne ' fatberg ' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of @entity4 's most exclusive streets			1
the enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes , was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in @entity9 to break			1
utility companies , including @entity11 , discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on @entity15 and @entity16 started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer			1
now a £ 400,000 repair is being carried out to repair the broken sewer and already 22 metres of new piping has been replaced with another 17 metres left to go			2
@entity32 , project manager for @entity11 said : ' the amount of fat we 've had to remove has been staggering			0
' @entity36 has done itself proud here - we see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes , which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through - but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a metre in diameter is mind - boggling			0
@entity11 , have now been forced to repair the old brick sewer , left , at a cost of £ 400,000 after it became damaged due to the fatberg ' the original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked down the plughole we 've had to opt for the time consuming and disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe			1
' i 'd urge the residents of @entity9 to consider what lurks beneath their feet - and when it comes to getting rid of fat - bin it , do n't block it			2
@entity65 – congealed fat which clumps together with other waste products to form concrete - style blocks – are becoming increasingly problematic for the capital 's sewers			0
the enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes , was found beneath @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity4 , pictured @entity4 's largest ever recorded fatberg , weighing in at 15 tonnes , was found in @entity75 in august 2013			1
and last year workers spent four days removing a fatberg the length of a jumbo jet from a sewer in @entity82 's @entity81			0
among the most common causes of drain blockages are make - up and nappy wipes , fat and grease , chewing gum , dental floss , plasters and building debris			0
staff from @entity11 usually use powerful suction equipment to break down the blockages and then high - powered water jets to clear the tunnels .			0
