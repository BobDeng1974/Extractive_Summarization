@entity5 , 60 , decided to leave his wife @entity6 , also 60 , to get the groceries at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , while he went to get a ticket			1
his boredom paid off to the tune of £ 6,299,421 after saturday 's draw when his numbers came up			1
he only found out about his win on monday because he fell asleep after getting home from the @entity18 vs @entity20 rugby match and only ' half - checking ' the ticket			1
@entity5 and @entity22 will split the money with their four children with whom they were in a syndicate the couple put their success down to a wish they made at a fountain in @entity33 while they were on holiday initially mr @entity5 thought he had four or five numbers but it was only on monday when he looked again that he learned of the good news			1
he sent a message to his children saying ' i 've got good news - we 've won the lottery ' and it will now be shared among them because they are part of a syndicate			1
celebrating their success at @entity51 in @entity9 , mr @entity5 said : ' i 'm excited , nervous and a bit confused			1
i was on two days holiday last week and have n't been doing the lottery every week but happened to be in @entity8 in @entity55			1
' i was at a loose end waiting for @entity22 so i put the lottery on			2
and it was pay day as well			0
but i did n't find out we 'd won @entity61 monday because i was at the rugby on saturday watching @entity18 v @entity20			1
' i drove home sunday so by the time i got back i was pretty knackered			0
i thought maybe i 've got four or five numbers but i went to bed			2
' i went to work the next day , logged on to my computer and thought i would check the numbers to see how much we had won			2
i saw we had six numbers and i checked and i checked and then came off the website and went back on and checked again			2
' a colleague was walking past and i asked him to tell me if the numbers were the same			2
i text my children before i phoned @entity22			2
it said something like ' i 've got good news , we 've won £ 6.2 million on the lottery '			0
the couple celebrated their £ 6,299,421 win at a hotel in @entity9 , @entity10 mr @entity5 did n't realise they had won the lottery until monday morning because he was too tired to check the tickets properly ' but i got sceptical texts back			1
thing like " oh yeh , i 'll have a car " or " you can get me a house "			0
they just did n't believe us			0
' the couple say they believe their win may be down to a wish they made while on holiday in @entity100 at the @entity101			1
they visited @entity100 in 2008 and vowed to return there ' if they ever won the lottery			1
' mr @entity5 added : ' we took my mother there a few years ago when an opportunity arose			1
she said she would like to go back and we said we would go back when we won the lottery			0
' we threw a coin in the @entity101 just because that 's what people do			0
i do n't remember the exact wish but during the holiday we said we wanted to win the lottery so we could come back to @entity33 - so i suppose it came true			0
' the couple 's £ 6 million win is part of a family syndicate with their four adult children , who wished to remain anonymous			1
describing the moment her husband broke the good news @entity125 , a bank nurse at @entity126 , said : ' @entity5 told me to sit down and said he had something to tell me			1
he said " we 've won the lottery "			0
i said " do n't be stupid "			0
' i thought he 's losing his marbles now			0
' so i phoned my mother - in - law because i thought if he 's told her then it must be true because he would n't dare tell her a lie			0
the couple hope to go back to @entity33 after vowing they would return if their numbers came up ' this only happened on monday so it has n't really sunk in yet			2
i 'm just happy for the kids , they 're going to be financially secure for the rest of their lives			0
' it 's nice that we can see them enjoy the money rather than have it after we have gone			0
' the couple , from @entity9 , who have four grown - up children and five grand - children , now plan to pay off the mortgage and buy a new @entity153 for mr @entity5 as they decide whether to move house or where to go on holiday			1
mrs @entity22 added : ' the children live all around the country but we went for a big family meal on tuesday night			2
' i 've barely slept five hours since monday so we have n't had chance to see friends too much yet			0
it 's all such a shock			0
