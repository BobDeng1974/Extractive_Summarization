the @entity1 rifle shooter @entity2 will be 34 weeks pregnant when she competes in the @entity3 in @entity4 in @entity3 shooting competitions , every ounce of concentration is required at all times			1
but when @entity1 shooter @entity2 takes aim with her rifle at the @entity13 , she ’s unlikely to be bothered by whispers in the crowd , the screech of a bird or a mobile phone going off			1
a kick at a crucial moment from her first child , however , and it could be a different story			0
the 29 - year - old from @entity24 - situated 125 miles north of @entity1 's capital @entity26 - is due to give birth to her first child on september 2 , less than a month after the @entity3 end			1
she will be about 34 weeks pregnant when she fires her rounds in the 10m rifle event			1
and with her huge baby bump , she will certainly be the most conspicuous of the 390 shooters taking part in the competition at the @entity37 in @entity38			0
she will not be the first pregnant athlete to compete in the @entity13 , but never before has a competitor been so close to the due date			1
@entity2 touched down in @entity4 yesterday with her husband @entity42 , a policeman			1
while he has been supportive of her @entity13 aspirations , friends and her national olympic committee were n’t so sure			1
‘ most people said i was crazy and selfish because they think i am jeopardising my baby ’s health , ’ she said			0
‘ my husband said grab it as this is a rare chance which may not come again			0
also , i am the mother			0
i know what i can do			0
i am a stubborn person			0
‘ they [ the @entity54 ] wanted to send me to @entity4 early because they are afraid , but what i hear from @entity1 airlines is that it is not recommended to travel for a pregnant woman from 35 weeks			1
’ @entity2 in action in a competition in @entity61 , @entity1 @entity2 carries her equipment after a practice session at the @entity37 @entity2 is currently ranked 47th in the world and is a former @entity66 gold medallist after the @entity13 have finished , she wo n’t have to wait too much longer to welcome her daughter , who will be named @entity68 , in to the world			1
and it could be a double celebration if @entity2 gets on the @entity3 podium			2
she is currently ranked 47th in the world and is a former @entity66 gold medallist , partnering @entity74 in the air rifle pairs at the @entity76 in @entity77			2
in november last year , she won two gold medals in the @entity79 in the 10 metre air rifle and 50m rifle three position			2
she achieved the @entity3 qualifying marks in both disciplines in january at the @entity86 event in @entity87 , days after finding out she was to become a mum , but her pregnancy will limit her to just the 10m event			2
understandably , @entity2 has had to adjust her stance to take part in the event			1
some rifle shooting disciplines involve lying on your stomach as one of three positions from which to shoot			1
' yeah , i can not do a prone position with this big stomach , ' she said			0
' at first yes , i was disappointed not to compete in that one ( three position ) but when i think back , this is still a great opportunity			0
‘ i will talk to the baby before i compete : ‘ no kicking , stay calm for one hour and 15 minutes only please			0
but if the baby kicks i have to breathe easy and let her calm down before shooting			2
’ but she is unfazed by the challenge , having been comfortable in what many would perceive as a ' man 's sport ' since the age of 15			0
' i like a rough job like that , not something girlie or feminine , i do n't like those types of sports so i tried and its been ok			0

@entity2 will be 34 weeks pregnant when she competes in 10m rifle shooting event in @entity4
29 - year - old from @entity24 is due to give birth on september 2
