two elderly cousins who lived together for 40 years have killed themselves because they feared being sent to separate nursing homes , it was revealed yesterday			1
@entity3 , 86 , and @entity4 , 89 , paid around £ 6,500 each to die together at a @entity6 clinic			1
mr @entity3 , who was virtually blind , and @entity7 , who was almost deaf and had suffered several strokes , lived at a sheltered housing complex in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the complex in @entity10 , @entity11 , where cousins @entity3 and @entity4 had been living after both suffered falls , they were convinced social services would intervene if their health deteriorated further			1
campaigners who helped them to contact the @entity6 assisted dying group @entity21 said they were ‘ completely interdependent ’ and had threatened to jump from a nine - storey building together if they could not reach @entity6			1
workers from the foundation helped them travel to an apartment owned by @entity21 in @entity27			0
there , they were assessed by two doctors who sanctioned their death			2
after receiving lethal doses of medication , they kissed each other goodbye and died hand - in - hand on november 10 last year , according to @entity21 ’s president dr @entity36			1
she said the pair , who had few surviving relatives , kept their plans secret : ‘ they were very , very afraid someone would find out and stop them			2
' their biggest wish was that they should be allowed to die together and not to live apart			0
they told me they hoped the law would change in @entity51 to allow them to have an assisted voluntary death at home , but that they could not wait because they were so afraid they would be separated			2
‘ mr @entity3 had fallen recently and i ’m sure his hand was broken but he refused to see a doctor because of that fear			1
they were both very sure they wanted to die			0
’ the cousins made contact with @entity21 in july last year and submitted medical reports and personal letters explaining why they wanted to die			1
neither mr @entity3 , a retired mechanical engineer , nor former council secretary @entity7 had a terminal illness			1
the late msp @entity70 , who introduced the @entity72 ( @entity73 ) @entity74			0
it is currently being scrutinised by the @entity73 government their medical reports were examined by two @entity6 doctors and the foundation ’s ethical board before dr @entity36 met the cousins at their home in august to assess if either was being pressured into a suicide pact by the other			1
she said : ‘ they were very , very ill and very old but both were very sure they wanted to end their lives together , after having lived together for so long			0
it was very difficult for them to make the journey to our apartment and it was distressing for them – they found it cruel that they had to travel – but once they were in @entity6 they were relaxed and full of joy			2
’ in @entity73 , the @entity72 ( @entity73 ) @entity74 , introduced by the late @entity70 is being scrutinised at @entity96			0
since her death last year following a long battle with @entity99 , the @entity74 has been championed by @entity101 @entity100			2
if the proposed legislation became law , seriously ill people over the age of 16 would be able to request help from a gp to hasten their death			0
dr @entity109 , campaign director of @entity110 , called the cousins ’ case ‘ a great tragedy ’			0
‘ this tragic case strongly underlines the need for comprehensive and affordable patient - centred care in which people ’s social and spiritual needs and not just physical needs are provided for , ’ he said			0
‘ failure to provide this support , particularly if accompanied by a change in the law to allow assisted suicide , will have the effect of steering more vulnerable elderly people towards taking their lives			0
