in fact she is a tourist in @entity6 , the birthplace of @entity8 's ninja , where visitors can pay for the pleasure of being taught in the ways of the ruthless feudal mercenaries			1
scurrying over walls , throwing deadly spiked darts , and walking across water in special ninja shoes were all vital skills used by the warriors to revolt against their samurai overlords , though how much use they are to tourists in 2013 is another matter			1
unusual holiday pursuit : a tourist concentrates as she slides across a rope in traditional ninja garb as part of a ninja training tour in @entity6 , @entity29 prefecture , in @entity8 tourists who pay for the ninja training experience can learn how to throw shuriken - deadly darts which the warriors hid in their hands and used for slashing and stabbing nonetheless , such tricks are now being taught to enthusiastic visitors as @entity6 , and its neighbouring town of @entity40 in @entity8 's @entity29 prefecture , use their ninja heritage to attract tourism and boost the local economy			1
@entity45 were most prominent in @entity8 in the 15th century , covert agents who specialised in unorthodox warfare using espionage , infiltration , sabotage and assassination			1
six centuries later , the warriors ' skills are being used to boost the area 's flagging economy			0
visitors to @entity6 can buy a ninja training tour , which will teach them how to scale a 20ft wall , throw shuriken darts ( concealed in the ninja ' hand and used for stabbing or slashing ) and cross rivers or ravines using ropes			2
tourists who manage to get through the course unscathed receive graduation certificates , while those after a less exhausting insight into the traditional warriors can visit @entity40 , an hour down the road , and watch a ninja display to learn how they garrotted unsuspecting victims			2
other attractions in @entity40 include an ancient shrine devoted to breaking up unhappy love matches , the beautiful white @entity79 , and plenty of tourist shops offering traditional sweets and biscuits			2
learn something new : the ninja training tour in the @entity8 town of @entity6 teaches participants how to climb a wall , and how to cross a river using special ninja shoes true ninja experience , 21st century - style : tourists change into dry clothes after praying under a waterfall during a ninja training tour in @entity6 a tourist show in @entity40 demonstrates traditional assassination methods used by the ninja , while the @entity6 training tour offers a chance to pray under a waterfall , right visitors to the @entity8 town of @entity40 in @entity29 prefecture pray at a shrine devoted to putting an end to unhappy relationships posters on a @entity8 train advertise the ninja experience in @entity40 , left , while tourists who complete the training tour in @entity6 receive a graduation certificate , right tourists are sized up for a ninja costume ahead of their training experience in @entity6 , one of the homes of the deadly warriors who date back to the 15th century @entity40 and @entity6 are known as the home of ninja because the first ever ninja were trained in the area in the early 15th century			1
the mountainous nature of the region may have helped boost the secretive image of the feared warriors , most of whom belonged to either the @entity40 or the @entity130			2
the men from @entity40 were particularly renowned for their fearlessness and deadly skills			0
like the samurai , ninja were usually born into the profession , with youngsters picking up skills as they grew up			0
as well as martial arts disciplines , young ninja learnt about survival and scouting techniques , about poisons , and how to administer first aid			0
they did not always work alone - sometimes they would work together to form a human platform to scale a high wall , or they would dress the same to cause confusion as to who committed a crime			0
@entity45 were spiritual , believing not only in a personal power but also in the way of the @entity155 , a deity , and the @entity157 , a race of birdlike spirits ( half - man , half - eagle ) , said to inhabit forests in @entity8			0
spiritual : @entity45 were spiritual and believed in various deities and powers , including the @entity157 birdlike spirits , which they believed lived in forests part of the @entity6 ninja training experience includes learning how to scale walls - this tourist is perhaps having a little more help than the average 15th century warrior not all rigorous training : tourists can sample traditional @entity8 sweets in the town of @entity40 , though the deadly shuriken dart is a reminder of the violent ninja past @entity8 shop owner and ninja descedant @entity183 shows photographs of his ancestor who performed as a ninja entertainer for groups of tourists years ago @entity79 , also known as @entity192 or the @entity193 , was built from 1585 with the tallest walls of any castle in @entity8 to prevent enemies scaling them - a record that still holds today			1
