@entity2 's new @entity1 defender @entity0 has all the qualities needed to be a big hit in the @entity5 , according to manager @entity6			1
the permanent transfer of the 24 - year - old from @entity9 was confirmed on wednesday night after all the formalities of international clearance on a work permit were completed			1
part of the deal , reported to be worth around £ 15million , sees @entity17 striker @entity16 move in the other direction on loan for the rest of the season			0
@entity0 completed his £ 11.2million switch from @entity9 to @entity2 on wednesday @entity6 admitted @entity2 were short on defensive cover , but although he believes it will take @entity0 time to settle , the @entity24 boss insists the player has what it takes to become an integral part of the squad			1
' he is a promising @entity1 defender			0
just 24 years old and we got the work permit			0
he has good pace , is good in the challenge and is tall , so he can adapt to @entity37 football , ' @entity6 told @entity38			1
' maybe it will take some time to adapt completely , but overall it is very good to have him			0
' this season he has played every game for @entity9 and we have seen him many times			1
we are convinced about his quality			0
the 24 - year - old defender was granted a work permit despite earlier fears it would be rejected ' he is very ambitious , focused and serious			1
that is important at a club like ours - you need to have a complete focus on your job			0
' i like the players who come from nowhere and show they can adapt			0
from @entity57 , he has ( then ) adapted to @entity58			2
that means he has already made it and adapted in another country , and so that is another important quality			0
' @entity2 's preferred central defensive partnership has been per @entity64 and @entity65			1
however , @entity6 accepts given the wretched run of injury misfortune , to head into the defining period of the campaign with not enough strength in depth at the back would have been folly			2
' we needed some cover , or we would not be responsible , ' added @entity6 , who could put @entity0 straight into the squad for sunday 's @entity5 game at home to @entity78			1
the 24 - year - old will wear the no 5 shirt , the north @entity80 club confirmed on thursday ' we needed another centre - back because we have lost ( @entity85 ) @entity84			2
( @entity87 ) @entity86 can play centre - back and we are a bit short there if something happens , especially with the @entity93 ( problem ) of @entity65 since the start of the season			0
' ( @entity0 ) can ( also ) play right - back and left - back , and that is of course a good quality as well			1
' @entity16 , meanwhile , is hoping to make the most of his second loan spell in @entity58 , having spent a season at @entity104 as he awaited international clearance to join up with the @entity24 ' first - team squad			0
the 22 - year - old said at a news conference ahead of thursday night 's @entity110 tie against @entity111 : ' i am very eager to get started on this new stage in my career			1
' a lot of people spoke very well about the club , the first of those being ( @entity2 midfielder ) @entity119 , who , when it was time , helped me decide to come here			2
the @entity1 will be competing with @entity65 and @entity64 for a place in central defence @entity17 forward @entity16 signed for @entity9 on loan for the rest of the season as part of the deal ' i know @entity129 and i feel like that is an advantage working for me as i adapt my style to the club 's			1
' i am going to give 200 per cent and i hope my football can bring joy to the fans			0
' @entity2 , who went through to the @entity138 fifth round with victory at @entity140 last weekend , will look to continue their @entity5 revival with victory over @entity78			1
@entity6 , however , revealed @entity143 forward @entity144 could miss out because of a hamstring problem			2
@entity147 international @entity146 has not played since december 28 because of a thigh injury , but is expected back early next week ahead of the @entity149 at @entity150			0
elsewhere , midfielder @entity151 ( groin ) is still not fully match fit , while @entity6 said @entity153 ' should join in normal training in 10 days ' following his recovery from ankle surgery			2
@entity144 , against @entity140 last weekend , could miss the @entity78 clash with a hamstring problem			0

@entity2 signed @entity57 defender @entity0 for £ 11.2m from @entity9
@entity0 has signed a four - and - a - half year contract at @entity2
@entity6 's side take on @entity78 at the @entity164 on sunday
