by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 20 march 2013 when @entity2 decided he wanted to hold a prestigious showjumping event in the grounds of @entity5 , he probably thought he would run into little difficulty			1
after all , not only is he the @entity7 's grandson , but he is also a cousin to the @entity8 and prince @entity9 , who have their residences there			0
however , the 35 - year - old did not account for the local council			1
disappointed : the @entity14 refused the @entity7 's grandson @entity2 planning permission for a showjumping event in the grounds of @entity5			1
he is pictured with fiance @entity18 event : mr @entity2 wanted to bring the @entity20 to @entity21 in june but was refused planning permission by the council			1
@entity5 is pictured mr @entity2 wanted to bring the @entity20 to @entity21 in june			1
the showjumping event would feature 30 of the world 's top riders and would have taken over part of the @entity29 park for a month			0
however , the @entity14 council refused him planning permission for the event because it decided it would have a detrimental effect on the home of his own family members			2
speaking to @entity37 , mr @entity2 said : ' we are extremely disappointed but we are determined that we are going to run the @entity20 in the @entity39 in 2013 and we are looking at a number of potential venues that we will confirm shortly			2
' it is a shame that we ca n't do it in the centre of @entity29 but it is still a fantastic series			0
' graphic : an aerial view of @entity5 and its surrounding grounds concerns : despite being a family member , the council felt that mr @entity2 event would have a detrimental affect on the home of the @entity8 and @entity55 the council said the event would fail to preserve or enhance the @entity5 setting or the character of the area			1
a petition and 300 objections from residents was sent to the council along with just four letters of support			0
the proposal which went before the council involved 292 horses being stabled in the park along with a 3,200 seat arena and hospitality marquees for 700 people			0
according to the @entity37 , a spokesman for the council said part of the reason permission was refused was because the park took longer than expected to recover from a temporary theatre which was put up last year			2
it is also believed the council did not want to set a precedent for events to be held in the park every year .			0
