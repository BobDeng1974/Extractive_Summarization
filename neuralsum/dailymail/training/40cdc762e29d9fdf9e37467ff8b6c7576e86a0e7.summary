@entity51 , a spokeswoman for the activists who called themselves ' @entity53 , ' said three were arrested and charged with vandalism and criminal trespass			2
a statement released on @entity53 ’ website read that the use of blood was meant to ‘ ( remind ) us of the horrific spilling of blood by nuclear weapons			1

@entity97 , coordinator for the @entity98 , said the group 's intention was not to demonstrate the lack of security at the plant , but to take a stance against the making of nuclear weapons			1

' it is a war crime			0

@entity142 , the private firm employed by the @entity11 @entity144 to provide security at @entity40 , is a subsidiary of the giant international security firm @entity147			0
@entity147 drew criticism for failing to provide the number of security personnel it promised to protect the @entity152 , forcing the @entity154 government to deploy extra army troops			0
a spokeswoman for @entity147 declined to comment and referred inquiries to government spokespeople			0
the security failure was an embarrassment both for the security firm and for the @entity162 , or @entity162 , the @entity144 branch that operates @entity11 nuclear weapons plants			2
' it was obviously a pretty serious incident , ' @entity162 spokesman @entity165 told @entity2			0

' @entity169 said the building served as the @entity11 government 's only ' warehouse ' for storing highly enriched uranium used in nuclear weapons			1
highly enriched uranium is a radioactive material used in the core of bombs to produce a nuclear detonation			2
the @entity14 plant is one of the most important government installations involved in the maintenance and production of the @entity11 nuclear arsenal			1
although the security breach occurred overnight last friday , officials confirmed that the shutdown - which applies to ' all nuclear operations ' at the y - 12 site - did not begin until wednesday			1
officials said it was expected to continue into next week			0
in the meantime , personnel at the facility would be given additional security training			0
@entity212 , a former congressional investigator and security consultant to the @entity144 , expressed scepticism at government assertions the nuclear material was not at risk			0
' it is unbelievable this could happen , ' @entity212 said			0
' the significance is outrageous			0
