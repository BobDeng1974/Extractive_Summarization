last updated at 5:51 pm on 6th october 2011 @entity1 's crazy weather took another nutty turn today as snow fell in the @entity4 while farmers in the south picked strawberries - and all just days after the country baked in the hottest october on record			1
@entity10 in the @entity4 was the first place in the @entity1 to experience the chill of winter as the ski slopes on the @entity15 resort experienced the first dump of snow			1
the mountain range south of @entity18 saw temperatures plunge overnight turning the hillside white			0
weather shock : the first snow of winter fell overnight in @entity23 in the @entity4 of @entity15 just days after thousands enjoyed a heatwave in the @entity26 of @entity27 deep and crisp and even : walkers at @entity23 in the @entity4 are among the first to enjoy the frosty delights of winter the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) said the snow had fallen where snow patches from last winter had survived through the summer months			1
while the south of country baked last weekend , small patches of snow remained on the hillside from one of @entity15 's hardest winters on record			1
with snow falling overnight in the north , there were hailstorms in the @entity46 in the south , which baked in @entity49 heat just days ago			1
@entity51 areas and country lanes around @entity53 in @entity54 were briefly turned white when hailstones the size of frozen peas pelted the area			1
forecasters are predicting chilly times ahead with frost expected across @entity27 at the weekend			2
@entity62 picking in @entity63 ! @entity64 at @entity65 , @entity66 , with the unseasonable crop and yet as parts of @entity1 shivered under wintery conditions , some farmers have been reporting extremely unseasonable events			1
with farmers in @entity74 picking their second crop of strawberries this year and in north @entity77 , ' spring ' lambs have been born four months early			1
farmer @entity78 is normally turning his attention to pumpkins but this year he is still picking strawberries			1
this evening showers will ease , become less widespread and largely confined to western parts of the @entity1 overnight			0
clear spells will develop elsewhere			0
it will stay windy though , and fall quite chilly in a few sheltered rural locations			0
friday blustery at first , although northwest winds generally easing through the day			0
there will be sunny spells for most , although with some showers , mainly in western parts of the @entity1			0
saturday generally cloudy , with periods of rain and brisk westerly winds for many			0
some drier and brighter spells are likely though , mainly in southern @entity27			0
temperatures a little above normal			0
mr @entity78 , 48 , who runs the family farm with his mother @entity98 , in @entity99 , @entity74 , was shocked to see an incredible two acres of his strawberry plants suddenly bearing fruit again this week			0
he has now seen a rush from pick - your - own customers to harvest the late strawberries , which have made an autumn comeback for the first time ever at his @entity65 in @entity99 , @entity74			1
mr @entity78 said : ' it is bizarre , we 've been doing pick your own strawberries here for 30 years and this has never happened before			2
' the hot autumn weather has tricked the strawberry plants into thinking it is late spring and they are throwing out lots of fruit			2
' it 's very strange to see people picking strawberries in october , we 're normally sizing up for the pumpkin market at this time , but the weather is so good no one is interested in them			1
' and he is not alone in finding his farm turned upside down by the unpredictable weather			2
farmer @entity129 from @entity77 believes the weather has been responsible for ' tricking ' his flock into thinking it was time to mate			2
sheep usually go to ram during warmer weather in august or september and give birth 20 to 21 weeks later in february and march			2
@entity62 picking in october : @entity136 , two , at @entity65 , @entity99 , @entity74 but mr @entity129 believes the unusually hot spell in april fooled his flock in @entity139 , @entity77 , into thinking summer had arrived - and they mated five months early			1
an unseasonably cold summer followed and the perfect warm spring weather for lambing arrived in the last week			2
he said he was stunned when the five spring lambs arrived because he had no idea they were even pregnant			2
it was the second time their mothers had given birth this year - which experts say it virtually unheard of			2
un-ewe - usal : a ' spring ' lamb was born on september 28 , four months early			1
an warm and dry april , followed by a cold summer washout , fooled the sheep into thinking autumn had already arrived prompting them to mate second coming : ' @entity159 ' lambs have been born early in @entity139 , @entity77 , after the weather tricked the flock into breeding out of season he said : ' it took me completely by surprise			1
i went down early in the morning to feed the sheep and count them as i usually do			0
' i noticed one was missing and found her under a hedge scraping at the floor and creating a bed			0
it was a hell of a shock			0
she 'd already had lambs once this year			0
' then , when i went around the rest of the flock i saw two others had dropped udders too and i ended up with two sets of twins and one single			0
' the only explanation i can think of is that because we had such a wonderful april they thought it was summer and had mated again			0
i 've never seen anything like it and it has to be down to the odd seasons we seem to have had this year			0
' the suddenly wintery conditions sweeping the country is in sharp contrast to the weekend 's weather , when three - quarters of a million sun - worshippers visited beaches in @entity199 and @entity200 as @entity1 basked in the third hottest day of 2011 , at 30c ( 86f )			1
@entity200 council had to pull its deckchairs and sun - loungers out of storage and shopkeepers across the @entity26 reported shortages of ice creams due to the out - of - season demand			1
at @entity211 in @entity212 on saturday , forecasters @entity209 recorded the 30c high , with @entity213 in @entity214 reaching an exceptional 29.6c ( 85.3f )			0
both temperatures beat the record for october – 29.4c ( 85f ) in @entity74 in 1985 – and ensured the @entity1 boasted better weather than almost all of @entity220 , the @entity221 , the @entity222 and the @entity223			1
@entity224 , the @entity226 city on the northern edge of the desert , managed only 22c ( 72f )			0
indian summer : @entity230 was awash with sunseekers as the temperatures hit as high as @entity49			1

walkers hit snow covered peaks after @entity238 highs at the weekend
' @entity159 ' lambs are being born four months early due to weather *confusion*
farmers are picking crops of strawberries - and it 's october
hailstones the size of frozen peas pelt an area where it 's just topped @entity49
