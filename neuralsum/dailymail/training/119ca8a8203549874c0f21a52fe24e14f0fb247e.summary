but rear adm. @entity22 , the @entity1 press secretary has now firmly denied any ransom plan , military.com reported			1
' there was no ransom offered , there was no ransom paid – nor was there an attempt to do so that failed , ' he said			1
rep. @entity17 ( center ) is a @entity34 veteran who is pressing the @entity1 for details about a failed plot to ransom @entity37 through a middleman who disappeared with the money a triumphant president @entity41 announced @entity14 's release in may , offering no suggestion that his administration had tried to ransom him before opting for a 5 - to - 1 prisoner swap instead @entity46 ? @entity14 's former platoon - mates said he walked away from his post in @entity49 and should have been court - martialed instead of reintegrated into the military however there was no clear attempt to address whether money had been paid - and disappeared			1
' i 'm not aware that any money changed hands , ' @entity22 said			0
but on the issue of payments to intelligence sources he added : ' there are such exchanges			1
' the carefully worded statements do n't appear to rule out the possibility that money was sent but never reached its target			0
@entity67 , the press secretary to , told @entity68 on thursday that the @entity16 holding @entity14 ' wanted to deal			2
they were desperate to deal			0
' official denials from the @entity41 administration , @entity67 said , are par for the course but likely deceptive			0
' we know better than to believe that , ' he explained			0
' that 's what they 're going to say , and that 's fine			2
but where there 's smoke there 's fire			2
' ' they can deny it all they want , ' added @entity67 , speaking of the administration 's official spokespersons			1
' but there are people within the @entity1 itself who are saying otherwise			1
... we know who discussed this issue within the @entity1			1
we know who briefed the secretary			1
' he said the government is in the habit of entertaining ransom plans , but always through third - parties that will give the @entity4 deniability			2

' ' the way we 've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround			0
' rep. @entity17 , a @entity34 veteran who served two combat tours in @entity116 and one in @entity49 after the 9/11 terror attacks , is among @entity120 's most persistent military bloodhounds			1

and the information we got back was resounding			0
' @entity133 press secretary @entity132 told reporters on wednesday that the @entity41 administration flatly opposes the idea of paying for the release of @entity4 held captive overseas			1
' it 's not in the best interests of @entity4 citizens to pay ransoms to any organization , let alone a terrorist organization , that is holding an @entity4 hostage , ' he said			2
' and the reason for that is simple : we do n't want to put other @entity4 citizens at even greater risk when they 're around the globe , and that knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the @entity4 if they take a hostage only puts @entity4 citizens at greater risk			2
' @entity17 dropped a bombshell in a nov. 5 letter to defense secretary @entity21 , claiming that @entity4 's @entity157 ' did pursue at least two lines of effort for @entity14 : a kinetic rescue operation , if necessary , and ; a payment to the @entity15 to gain @entity14 's release			1
' ' it has been brought to my attention , ' @entity17 wrote , ' that a payment was made to an @entity49 intermediary who ' disappeared ' with the money and failed to facilitate @entity14 's release in return			1
the payment was made in january - february 2014			2
' @entity17 also seemed to understand the careful parsing of denials that often follows inquiries – from both congressmen and journalists – into sensitive national security matters			2
' i recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom , ' he wrote , but claimed the botched payment was made – ' regardless of how the transaction is described			1
' in a separate letter to the directors of the @entity186 , the @entity187 and @entity188 , he expressed his understanding that ' a transfer occurred that possibly included payment to @entity15 from the @entity5 for the receipt of @entity14			2
' accusation : @entity17 's press secretary told @entity68 that defense secretary @entity21 was briefed on the failed ransom plan , which had to involve third parties in order to give the @entity133 deniability @entity198 : the @entity49 released from @entity199 in exchange for @entity14 were among the most senior members of the @entity5 held at the prison camp , including one who had direct ties to @entity205 according to the @entity207 , unnamed officials said the @entity210 's elite @entity209 anti-terrorism squad handled the @entity14 ransom mission			1
' the @entity186 also was involved in the ransom payment attempt and was waiting inside @entity49 's border with @entity214 when the release failed , ' the @entity207 reported , ' confirming that it had been a scam			1
' the @entity217 makes it a crime to give payment or assistance to terror groups that could boost their support , and hostages ' family members have said publicly that the federal government warned them against raising money for their loved ones ' safe return			0
