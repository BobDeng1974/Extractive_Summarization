@entity0 has hinted that @entity1 will not be risked against @entity2 in @entity5 's potentially decisive @entity4 clash on thursday			1
the @entity6 forward had impressed during @entity5 's final warm - up games before a knee injury suffered against @entity9 almost ended his @entity4 hopes			1
although @entity1 was eventually included in the 23 - man squad and has been recovering well , @entity0 has confirmed he is unlikely to use him against @entity2			1
sorry son ! @entity0 has confirmed @entity1 will not be used against @entity2 on the mend : the @entity6 forward will resume training with the squad and could feature against @entity16 lonely game : @entity1 spent his last day training as an individual in @entity20 ' he is not in contention for tomorrow , but he will take part in the next four training sessions , ' @entity0 said of his only injury concern			1
' today was his last training session as , if you like , an individual			0
' at the minute , we could have taken a chance with him tomorrow , but it would be much better if he uses the four days after this game and before the @entity16 game to train with the team			1
' fortunately for us , his actual injury has responded really well to treatment but i do n't think we will put him into the firing line tomorrow before he has had some training sessions with the team			2
' the @entity5 manager would not be drawn on the debate surrounding @entity42 , but did use statistics as evidence the @entity45 is still performing for the team despite failing to score his first @entity4 goal			1
stat attack : @entity0 insists he was ' satisfied ' with @entity42 's performance against @entity51 leader of the pack : @entity5 captain is guaranteed to start against @entity2 on thursday fearless : @entity5 youngster @entity56 was a revelation against @entity51 and could be selected to start again @entity58 : @entity5 speaking about @entity42 , he said : ' i try not to comment too much on where pressure is brought to bear			1
i do n’t control what people are writing or reporting			0
' i was satisfied with his performance against @entity51			2
stats said ran more than any @entity5 player , had more sprints than any other			2
' @entity42 is one of our three players with @entity4 and @entity72 experience with 100 caps , or nearly in @entity42 ’s case , and they have to expect the focus is on them			1
' the good thing is that @entity42 more than happy to do that			2
if he plays , i hope you ’ll see that in his performance			0
' high spirits : @entity5 players share a joke ahead of what could be the defining game of their @entity4 @entity5 face being eliminated from the @entity4 should they lose to @entity2 and @entity51 draw with @entity16			1
however , @entity0 is confident they can still progress despite losing their opening game in @entity92			1
it ’s three important games , each stands alone			0
' we ’ve had the first and we ’ve analysed the good and the bad from it			0
we ’ve definitely got it out of our system and we ’re focused on tomorrow			0
it will be a good game against a very good team			0
we always knew more than two contenders in this group , ' he said			0
@entity107 hot ! @entity108 is likley to be asked to lead @entity5 's line again after scoring in the defeat to @entity5 of thursday 's opponents , @entity0 conceded the strength of their team and emphasised how important a part @entity5 's defence will have to play to deny their talented forwards			1
' they have two absolutely top class forwards in @entity119 and @entity120 and a third in @entity121 , ' said the @entity5 manager			2
' they have very talented midfielders also , especially @entity124 and they ’re strong at set - plays and very experienced			0
add them together and it ’s a strong team			0
' they must be disappointed with opening game but like us that ’s in the past			0
we expect to see @entity2 with their big guns blazing			2
we ’ll have to be certain our defending is sufficient to keep them at bay while posing questions ourselves			0

@entity1 will not play for @entity5 against @entity2
