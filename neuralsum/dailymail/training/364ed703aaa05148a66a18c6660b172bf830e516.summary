by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 07:23 est , 28 may 2013 a double lung and heart transplant patient told she was ' fit to work ' by @entity6 assessors died nine days after her benefits were stopped			1
@entity8 , 49 , was on 10 different prescription medications a day following complications with a major operation 28 years ago			1
the former council worker suffered with high blood pressure and regular blackouts , but @entity17 , the government - contracted healthcare assessors ruled that she was ' fit to work '			1
her husband @entity19 , 50 , said : ' i sat there and listened to my wife drown in her own body fluids			1
it took half an hour for her to die ; a woman who is apparently fit for work			2
' denied benefits : double heart and lung transplant patient @entity8 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , with her beloved dog @entity33 he described the last few months of his wife ’s life as ' a misery ' , saying that she worried constantly about her benefit payments and worried that she would be seen as ' a scrounger '			1
she was formerly granted less than £ 110 a week in employment and support allowance , but following the ruling , was told that it was being stopped as she lay dying in hospital			1
mrs @entity8 , who lived in @entity30 , @entity31 , had her first heart and lung transplant in 1985 and returned to work , but her body began to reject the transplanted organs			1
she had a second heart and lung transplant four years later , but complications meant that she was in surgery for 31 hours			0
following the second transplant , she was unable to return to work and began to receive benefit payments while her husband worked			0
mr @entity56 said his wife was not fit to work as she was ' listless ' , would faint regularly and was frequently in and out of the @entity58 in @entity59 , where she was seen by heart and lung specialists			1
in february , her employment support allowance was withdrawn as the @entity6 promised to ' get tougher ' on welfare			0
she then had to be assessed by @entity17 assessors in @entity66 , but despite her regular blackouts and medical history her husband was not allowed to be present			1
mrs @entity8 , 49 , was on 10 different prescription medications a day following complications with a major operation 28 years ago mrs @entity8 was questioned for 20 minutes and assessors found she was fit to work and subsequently stopped her employment support allowance and disability living allowance			1
she appealed , but the @entity75 rejected it			0
mrs @entity8 died in hospital on april 24 with her husband by her side			2
he now wants to expose the ordeal his wife went through			2
mr @entity56 said : ' i do not know how , or if , it will change the system , but at least we can show the population what people like @entity8 have to go through at the hands of these people			2
' some of the questions mrs @entity8 is likely to have been asked by @entity17 : do you read the paper ? do you live alone or with someone ? do you have children ? do you watch tv ? how did you get here today ? do you do your own shopping ? how often do you see a doctor ? how often do you see a nurse ? what time do you get up ? can you get washed ? can you get dressed ? do you cook ? do you have hallucinations ? have you ever hurt yourself ? what is 100 minus 25 ? can you spell ' world ' ? what is 96 minus 7 ? can you name the current prime minister ? can you name the president of the @entity107 ? do you drink alcohol ? how is your temper ? do you listen to music ? do you have a mobile phone ? a spokesman for the @entity75 said : ' a decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment , and after consideration of all supporting medical evidence			1
' @entity119 were granted a £ 400million five - year contract in april to carry out tests to determine whether people who currently claim incapacity benefits are fit for work			2
@entity17 interviewed and assessed over 20,000 people a week last year with conservative party chairman , @entity126 , saying the assessments ' demonstrate why welfare reforms are so important '			2
however , almost 40 per cent of those that appealed against their rulings had them overturned			0
earlier this year , the executive in charge of the medical assessments for benefit claimants , made a public apology to those that @entity119 had incorrectly assessed as being ' fit for work ' mrs @entity8 had appealed against the decision that she was fit for work , but the appeal was rejected by the firm , despite her medical history			1
a statement on the @entity17 website says : ' the assessments look at how conditions affect an individual in undertaking activities and tasks of daily living , rather than focusing on the diagnosis of the medical condition or its treatment			2
' they focus on what the person does in a typical day , how this is achieved and how it varies or fluctuates			0
we then combine information from the assessment with their own observations and medical knowledge to provide an independent report to the @entity75			0
' the government ordered fresh assessments on thousands of people claiming incapacity benefits back in 2010			0
@entity75 statistics show 41 per cent of claimants have appealed against decisions on their benefits after the tests , with 38 per cent having previous decisions overturned			0
factoring in these successful appeals would significantly lower the number of people found ' fit for work '			0
but charities have voiced concern that the the @entity119 is unfair			0
in november last year it was revealed a heart patient was told he was fit for work - just a day after a double heart bypass operation			1
@entity191 , 60 , received the letter from a healthcare firm working on behalf of the government as he recovered in the intensive care unit of @entity196 and @entity197			0
mr @entity191 's employment and support allowance - a benefit which has replaced incapacity benefit - was later stopped			0
it was only restarted after he went to a tribunal .			0
