‘ when he was born i could tell by the look my mum ’s face that @entity7 was n’t right , ’ said his mother , a shop worker , who already had another son @entity28 , two , from a previous relationship			2
‘ it was such a shock to see my baby in that state			0
we were allowed a quick cuddle before he was whisked off to the intensive care unit			2
‘ throughout our stay in hospital it was just one thing after another			0
it ’s fantastic to finally get him home and start living as a normal family with @entity28 and my partner @entity21 ’s daughter @entity46			1
’ acting fast : @entity7 was just two days old when doctors rushed him into emergency surgery to treat his condition shock : @entity10 was told early in the pregnancy that something might be wrong with @entity7 but did not know the full extent of his condition until he was born hope : @entity7 was given two stomas in surgery , seen in the picture , and a colostomy bag , and his parents were told he would recover within two weeks @entity7 was suffering from a condition called @entity60 - a type of hernia - which affects around one in 2,000 births			1

he was just two days old when he had emergency surgery to place his organs back inside his body			1
his mother said : ‘ it was very scary			0
my tiny baby was surrounded by wires and machines all the time			0
‘ we thought after the surgery it would take him two weeks to recover and then we would have him home - but it did n’t work like that			2
’ @entity7 was given two stomas - openings on the abdomen which allow stools and urine to exit the body - and a colostomy bag ,			1
his parents were promised he would be better by his first birthday			0
family : despite the second operation and a longer recovery time , @entity10 and @entity21 have been told their son will go on to live a normal life however , a short while later , his stomas became blocked and @entity7 was rushed in for more surgery			1

his mother said : ‘ some women get chance to enjoy their pregnancy , but not me			0
knowing from 12 weeks that there was going to be something wrong with my baby made it hell			0
‘ now we ’ve finally got him home i can concentrate on making up for that			0
’ a spokesperson from the @entity108 , the @entity109 ’s only @entity60 charity said : ‘ it is usually picked up by week 14 in the pregnancy and is a condition for which the cause is unknown , yet seems to be on the rise			0
