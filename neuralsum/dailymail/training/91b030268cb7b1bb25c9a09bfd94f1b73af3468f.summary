from a bootless young parent in the @entity1 to a £ 30million target for one of @entity6 football ’s biggest clubs , via the @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s career path is one less travelled , but then this is a man who does nothing in a conventional manner			1
that extends to his dress sense , nightclub conversations and sneezes , which his former @entity20 colleague @entity19 recalled as being so loud they briefly halted work in the @entity24 reception one day			1
@entity19 added that when ‘ he gives you a play punch , he does n’t realise that it really does hurt ’			2
that ’s the powerhouse of a striker who has made a far bigger mark on @entity33 football and who will soon achieve the dream he has long held of joining a @entity37 club			1
@entity20 striker @entity11 turned up in a rather unique outfit for an interview with @entity40 last year @entity41 look set to sign @entity11 after opening talks with @entity20 over a £ 30million deal for the striker @entity11 celebrates after scoring for @entity20 against @entity45 during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity47 on @entity48 it ’s the ambition that he has stated in numerous text messages to his countryman , friend and confidant , @entity55 ; one that has driven him since he went eyeball to eyeball with his father as a 14 - year - old to spell out his own plans for life			1
@entity11 grew up as the eldest of three children in the @entity65 area of @entity66 , in the south of the @entity1			1
his father was a teacher and his mother , a black belt in judo , worked in administration			0
they were n’t poor but they did n’t have much , which is why it was significant when , aged 14 , @entity11 quit the expensive school in which his father had enrolled him two months earlier			1
in an interview with @entity40 a year ago - @entity11 ’s first with a @entity79 newspaper after his £ 12m move to @entity20 in 2013 - the striker explained how badly the news went down			1
he said : ‘ my father paid for me to go to this school for a year but i said , “ i do n’t want that , i want to play football			2
do n’t pay anything ”			0
‘ he would say , “ go to school and after that you can play			2
there are other people , like doctors , who play football ”			2
but i said , “ @entity96 , no. everyone has a destiny ”			0
man , he went * * * * * * * crazy			0
she bought me boots , black boots , because i used to play without shoes			0
i used to hurt my feet			0
’ former @entity20 goalkeeper @entity19 admitted to @entity40 that @entity11 's playful punches really hurt after falling out with his father , @entity11 joined an academy set up by @entity105 , the former @entity1 defender who played for @entity106 and @entity107			1
@entity11 is anything but laidback and admits he always has to be in control @entity11 used to be a defender , but during one game the academy ’s striker was injured and he took his place			1
two goals gave @entity11 ’s coach a brainwave			1
‘ he came up to me and said , “ you ’re not a stopper any more ” , ’ @entity11 recalled			1
in 2006 , aged 17 , @entity11 joined his first professional club , @entity120 in the @entity1 , and a few months later was invited for a trial at @entity123 ’s @entity122			1
they liked him but wanted to monitor him rather than offer a contract			0
having just had the second of his two sons - they and their mother live with him in @entity20 - and with only a few more coins to his name , his instincts were finely tuned to providing instead of waiting			1
an offer was available to join @entity133 there and then , so @entity11 took it			1
when he arrived , he saw snow for the first time and thought , ‘ what the f * * * is that ? ’ by the time he left in 2008 , @entity11 had learned fluent @entity7 , could ski and had scored 30 goals in 75 games			2
he moved to @entity8 , where he hit 53 in 73 games for @entity144 , and then he joined @entity20 for an initial £ 12m and has scored 34 goals in 70 games			1
@entity40 understands there was a clash last summer between @entity11 ’s representative and @entity20 chairman @entity150 , such was the former ’s desire to capitalise on a 25 - goal debut season with a transfer			1
bony scores past @entity41 goalkeeper @entity156 in november as @entity20 lost 2 - 1 at the @entity157 @entity11 could have forced the issue but he has largely kept faith that @entity20 would not stand in his way if a top club made an acceptable offer			1
that time is approaching , with a £ 100,000 - a - week salary believed to have been agreed			0
certainly , @entity11 will not have sold himself short			2
but the greatest incentive , he has long claimed , is the desire ‘ to show what i am ’			0
that person is a 26 - year - old of huge intensity , who once told @entity40 : ‘ i have to be in control - at the end of the season i want to do this , after next season i want to do that			2
@entity11 , pictured climbing above the @entity184 defence in march , says he always tries to be in the right place ‘ i know who can help me , who ca n’t help me			2
the people who can help , from the beginning i talk to them			0
“ if you help me , i help you ”			0
‘ i am quite an intelligent guy and i like to use my power			0
in the disco or anywhere , i tell my team - mates , “ if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know i am good with my head			0
if i head the ball one time it can be a goal			0
if i am not there , it is my mistake ”			0
i have absolute belief in myself			0
’ that extends to believing he can play for the best clubs in @entity209			0
‘ every player wants to play @entity37 football , ’ said @entity11 last night			1
‘ when you get that opportunity you go on , or not			0
’ @entity55 reinforces the message with texts that read : ‘ do n’t let anyone destroy your objectives			0
’ @entity11 tends to reply : ‘ i will never let anyone destroy my objectives			2
’ so far he has been true to his word			0
@entity11 has interested a number of clubs having scored the most @entity224 goals in the calendar year @entity11 and his team - mates celebrate his goal at @entity228 against @entity122 , who opted against signing the striker			2

@entity41 are in talks with @entity20 to sign @entity11 for £ 30m
the @entity1 ace has always wanted to play in the @entity37
@entity11 *revealed* to @entity40 that he may have become a fashion *designer*
