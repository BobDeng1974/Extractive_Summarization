by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 20:30 est , 25 november 2012 we give banks our hard - earned cash to look after , and what do we get in return ? leaflets we ca n't understand , emollient twaddle about ‘ relationships ' with people we do n't know , charges we were n't expecting , and , if we 're really doing well , a free fake leather cover for our cheque book			1
as far as i am concerned , bank managers still ( erroneously ) think they are doing us a favour , when it ought to be the other way round			1
recently , i decided to change banks , after my manager 's assistant ( who i had never met ) told me they were allowing me to keep a joint account ' as a favour '			1
bank managers still think they are doing us a favour , when it ought to be the other way round ... this account had only a few hundred quid in it , and was being used to pay household bills			1
my other accounts were always in credit			1
model customer , you might think , except this snooty bank ( @entity35 ) acted like i was a penniless nuisance			1
they charged me £ 150 a quarter on the joint account , ludicrous when there were so few transactions			1
i decided to move to @entity41 , but then my stress levels really started to soar			1
it 's taken five weeks , four different people writing me strings of emails , dozens of incomprehensible forms , and i 've ended up with two managers at two different branches ! according to @entity0 , snooty banks treated her like a penniless pest and charged her extortionate fees they decided my company credit card could have only a £ 1,000 limit ( even though i was bringing a large business savings account ) as if i was an ignorant student , and not someone who has made a living as a broadcaster and writer for over 40 years			1
then , they had the cheek to announce the limit would be increased ‘ as a gesture of goodwill ' in the light of problems moving my accounts			1
this makes me even crosser			2
i do n't need a favour , just what i am entitled to — respect ! stuff a relationship , what about service ? i went to two meetings of an hour and a half each , and now another manager wants to meet ‘ to cement our relationship '			1
banks should be there to serve us , not provide staff with chances to have a coffee and see the inside of our house or office			1
banks need to start treating their clients a lot better to prevent the souring relationship between banker and customer i am not very welcome as a customer because i do n't need a mortgage , a loan and advice on investments			1
i am one of those irritating crumblies who manages to remain afloat all by myself — something banks are n't keen on when they can charge big fees if we exceed our overdraft			1
which ? magazine reports that only one in ten of us read the small print when switching banks , because the information they provide is so confusing			1
@entity41 — and i can vouch for this — hits the jackpot with a 29,000 - word document that takes around an hour and a half to read ! i am not interested in internet banking , all i want is statements and cash out of a machine			2
i have n't even got the details of the ‘ free ' travel insurance they promised four weeks ago			2
then they sent a form asking me to rate my ‘ experience '			2
i put a great big cross right through it — are they paying me to do their research ? it 's not surprising that only 40 per cent of ‘ extremely dissatisfied ' customers ( less than 4 per cent of all of us ) can face the trauma of switching banks			1
next year , things should improve following a report by the @entity140			2
under the new rules , by september 2013 , changing banks should take fewer than seven days			1
if we suffer any inconvenience , we should be able to claim compensation			2
good luck ! you 'll still get a free credit - card wallet easier than a new business loan			2
meanwhile , @entity150 , the chairman of @entity41 , says he 'd like bankers to sign up to an oath , like doctors , and be monitored by an independent body enforcing a code of conduct			2
one of the proposed rules would require bankers ‘ to act honestly and fairly at all times when dealing with clients '			2
i 'd go further , how about remembering that old adage ‘ the customer is always right ' ? mr @entity150 is said to be looking for new non-executive directors for his board — i 'm available and waiting for his call			1
@entity166 taught me how to steal the show @entity169 baddie : @entity166 as @entity170 cheerio , @entity172 , you 'll be missed			0
@entity166 was one of the most entertaining actors i ever encountered , far more eccentric than his on - screen persona as the ultimate baddie in @entity169			0
when we met at a dinner party in @entity178 in the early @entity179 , he was smoking a large joint , and announced he spent every sunday at his home in @entity182 in silence , in order to preserve his sanity			0
@entity166 was fabulously indiscreet about his @entity169 co-stars and revealed that when contract re-negotiations were in full swing , everyone tried to get in front of the cameras ( even when they were not needed ) as much as possible to build up their ratings			0
it got so bad that he and @entity195 ( played by @entity196 ) were patting each other on the back , shaking hands and sidling up to each other so frequently , they were told off ! he taught me loads of valuable tricks about how to upstage rivals on a show , many of which i still employ today			0
so far , i 'm dead disappointed detective @entity208 takes aim the new series of @entity208 is proving to be a struggle			0
detective @entity208 ( right ) remains as compelling as ever , but this drama seems to be using too many of the same stock shots of the city at night we already saw in @entity218 political thriller @entity216			0
who cares about dreary party leaders rushing up and down dim corridors in government offices , vying to form a coalition government ? the leading lady looks as if she has n't slept for weeks , and seems to have aged ten years since @entity225			0
the action takes place in the dark , and the budget cuts the police are coping with seem to mean every office is lit with a single bulb			0
so far , i 'll award the killing just six out of ten			0
what makes celebrities happy ? @entity236 on the red carpet to raise money for a new museum of @entity242 illustration in @entity178 , artists were tasked with turning the lists of what makes celebrities happy into pictures to be auctioned at @entity247 's next month			0
@entity248 drew @entity249 swimming while his wife @entity250 stands on the riverbank with a stopwatch , surrounded by spaghetti , pyjamas and their dog chewing on a shoe			0
@entity236 ( right ) picked clogs , cereal with milk , and a black t - shirt ( by trendy @entity261 , not just any old garment )			0
@entity263 chose @entity265 's @entity264 and @entity266 ( an @entity267 dish of boiled meats ) , which sounds rather pretentious			0
other celebs included @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272			0
i was n't honoured , but i doubt whether an illustration of my list would have fetched much			0
black pudding for breakfast , a walk in the rain , cotton @entity280 knickers , and pink turnips from my veg plot			0
i 'm too cheap and cheerful .			0
