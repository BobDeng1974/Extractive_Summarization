there are no doubt many people who are better qualified than @entity2 to present a programme on the rise of the @entity5 but you can see why @entity8 producers chose the former @entity10 star to front their latest venture : his enthusiasm is infectious , and his name is likely to get people tuning in to catch the actor ’s take on this fascinating period of history			1
plus , the subject matter is a soap writer ’s dream : there is political backstabbing , kidnapping and murder from the off			2
the four - part series @entity28 : @entity30 ’s @entity29 sees the @entity32 star chart the rise of the city from a collection of mud huts to a republic and a mighty empire spanning from @entity39 to the @entity40			1
seeing the sights : a trip to @entity28 would n't be complete without a visit to the famous @entity44 bringing history to life : the @entity47 was the site of some of ancient @entity28 's most important buildings @entity52 is a self - confessed @entity53 ( at one point he tells viewers ‘ i feel like a kid at @entity57 ’ ) and jumped at the chance to present the programme : ‘ they wanted the person that presented this story to do it from the point of view of an interested history buff rather than an expert ’ , he explains			1
‘ what we ’re doing is opening up the story in a way that people can understand the way it all came about			2
it ’s the story of the birth of a superpower - it ’s all about how a bunch of @entity79 people living in little huts eventually finished up creating a civilisation the echoes of which have lasted for two and a half thousand years			1
’ the series opens with @entity28 ’s 2,767th birthday celebrations in april			1
gladiators , centurions , senators and @entity89 stream past the camera during the procession which this year coincided with @entity92 : a time when thousands of people flood into the city			2
‘ @entity28 ’s birthday is on a certain date whereas @entity92 can change by as much as a month ’ , @entity52 explains			1
‘ we had to deal with an incredible number of tourists			2
unless you are a @entity102 and you want to go there with hundreds of thousands of people , i would really avoid @entity92 time			0
you ’re going to be there with thousands of tourists anyway , but when you go there [ at @entity92 ] , you ’re going to have double the amount of tourists			0
they flock in from all over @entity111			0
’ the parade , he says , is wonderful but warns : ‘ if it ’s colliding with @entity92 , i ’d leave it to the next year			0
’ big draw : @entity28 ’s birthday procession includes gladiators , centurions , senators and @entity89 keen student : @entity52 also visited the @entity121 to find out more about the @entity122 @entity52 plays the role of interested history student , frequently consulting a little red book that he carries around in his satchel , which contains roman historian @entity129 ’s account of the birth of @entity28 , written 700 years after the event			1
the finer points are explained with the help of leading historians and the archaeological sites are brought to life with the use of @entity138			0
at @entity139 , @entity2 reveals more about @entity140 and @entity142 ’s deadly struggle to create a city , and discovers what the earliest settling would have looked like			2
he then jumps forward a couple of hundred years at the @entity146 to explain how @entity147 , @entity28 ’s seventh king , was ousted and the @entity122 was born			1
there is also a rare opportunity to descend into @entity28 ’s claustrophobic ancient sewer network , parts of which date back to the 6th century @entity153 and are still in use today			1
this elicits further ‘ kid at christmas time ’ enthusiasm from @entity52 but he reminds viewers that the complex network of tunnels was built at a terrible cost : enemy soldiers captured on the battlefield were forced to work as slaves on the construction			2
many died and some even committed suicide rather than continue to work on the project			0
the sewers are , of course , not on the tourist map and @entity52 is aware how privileged he was : ‘ i spoke to a lot of archaeologists who were really jealous of the fact that i ’d been down there			0
’ annual pilgrimage : thousands of tourists flock to @entity180 at @entity92 famous ruins : @entity2 visited @entity182 to find out more about the divide between patricians and plebeians travelling with a camera crew opens lots of doors but @entity2 could not escape @entity111 ’s infamous red tape and had to be accompanied by professional guides at all times : ‘ filming anything in @entity28 is a big earner for the city and you have got to have permits for everything ’ , he explains			1
‘ if you get out of that van with a camera there will be a policeman asking where your permit is			0
so you need a professional ‘ fixer ’ to ensure you can do what you need to do			0
’ the money raised contributes to the cost of maintaining the archaeological sites that @entity52 visited , many of which are ‘ kind of just left hanging there ’ : ‘ they are desperate to get money for companies like @entity8 to film there because it helps them to put money in the kitty to open up more stuff			2
' and , not only that , all these things that have been exposed have got to be maintained and it costs a fortune to keep these sites safe and out of danger of being ruined by the weather			0
’ getting the expert 's opinion : @entity2 ( right ) with @entity39 historian dr @entity227 wave of democracy : @entity2 found people in @entity231 to be ' much cooler ' since the revolution later episodes will see @entity52 travel to @entity236 , where 70,000 roman coins were found in a farmer ’s field , and to @entity240 and @entity231 where the @entity241 fought the @entity242 and general @entity243			1
@entity52 last visited @entity231 in 2004 but says he felt much more relaxed on his return : ‘ since they had their revolution there it is a lot nicer place to be ’ , he explains			1
‘ people are much cooler			0
they ’ve had this extraordinary wave of democracy			0
there are still a lot of police on the streets but you feel a lot more at ease walking around in @entity260 now			0
’ the actor also got to film in parts of @entity263 that he ’d never visited before , including @entity264 which he found to be a ‘ glorious , glorious city ’			1
and heading to some of @entity111 ’s more provincial cities helped him to see another side to the country : ‘ i often say to people , if you ’re coming to @entity39 , @entity266 is an extraordinary city but if you want to get a real taste of @entity39 you ’re actually much better off going to a provincial city like @entity269 , for example			2
so we went off to those sort of equivalent places : @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity182			0
‘ it ’s going to those places and staying in funny little hotels - nothing fancy - that gives you a real taste of what the country is like			2
not being on the tourist trail as it were			0
that was the great thing about it - we were going to places where there were n't any tourists and i think that ’s what people do n’t do enough			2
i think people are a little bit lacking on the sense of adventure			0
’ setting the stage : the ruins of a @entity241 theatre in the old harbour city of @entity308 , just outside of @entity28 but @entity28 remains a big draw for @entity52 - he tries to visit at least once a year – and he says the series has shown him the city in a ‘ way i only ever dreamed of ’			1
his tip for visitors is to explore on foot : ‘ i love to walk around some of the little old quarters , tiny little winding roads and back ways where you get a sense that you are in an ancient city			1
and i could walk along the river for hours			0
’ he also recommends visiting the @entity325 , near @entity326 , which houses one of the world ’s most important collections of classical art and is often overlooked by tourists			0
those who want to explore a little further should take a train or a bus to the old harbour city of @entity308 : ‘ it ’s incredible out there - the ruins are amazing			1
you can wander around for hours and there are not so many tourists			0
’ and does he now feel that he has covered everything @entity341 has to offer ? ‘ no , there ’s too much too see			0
i want to go back to @entity28 in the winter time			1
my @entity241 friends moan about it being too cold but i ’ve been to the south in the winter time where they moan about it being too cold and for me it ’s like a summer ’s day			1
people are walking along the beach thinking : ‘ there ’s a mad person in the sea ! ’ ’ @entity28 : @entity30 ’s @entity29 is on fridays at 8pm on @entity8 to book your own tour of @entity28 visit through @entity358 , www.througheternity.com			1
