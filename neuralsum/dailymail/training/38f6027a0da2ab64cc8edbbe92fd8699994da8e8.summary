by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:22 est , 5 august 2012 updated : 18:47 est , 5 august 2012 after traveling eight - and - a - half months and 352 million miles , @entity4 's most high - tech rover will attempt to make a landing on @entity6			1
. the curiosity rover zeroed in on the red planet where it will attempt a tricky celestial gymnastics routine during a ' seven minutes of terror ' plummet through the atmosphere on sunday			1
it was poised to hit the top of the @entity6 atmosphere at 13,000 mph			0
if all goes according to script , it will be slowly lowered by cables inside a massive crater in the final few seconds			0
' we score and win or we do n't score and we do n't win , ' he said			0
if all goes well , mission control at the @entity26 should hear a signal at 10:31 p.m. @entity40			0
the space agency warned that confirmation could take longer if an orbiting spacecraft that 's supposed to listen for curiosity during the descent is not in the right place			2
@entity24 's trajectory was so accurate that engineers decided to wave off a last chance to tweak its position before atmosphere entry			2
' we 're ready to head in , ' said mission manager @entity53			0
not ones to tempt fate , flight controllers planned to break out the " good luck " peanuts before @entity24 takes the plunge as part of a long - running tradition			0
one scientist who can relate to the building anxiety is @entity64 planetary scientist @entity63 , who headed @entity4 's last successful rover mission in 2004			1
this time around , @entity66 has a supporting role and planned to view the landing with other researchers in the ' science bullpen			0
' ' landing on @entity6 is always a nerve - racking thing			0
you 're never going to get relaxed about something like landing a spacecraft on @entity6 , ' he @entity66			0
sunday 's touchdown attempt was especially intense because @entity4 is testing a brand new landing technique			1
due to the communication delay between @entity6 and @entity79 , @entity24 will be on autopilot			0
there 's also extra pressure because budget woes have forced @entity4 to rejigger its @entity6 exploration roadmap			1
artist 's impression of @entity4 's @entity24 on the surface of @entity6 ' there 's nothing in the pipeline ' beyond the planned launch of a @entity6 orbiter in 2013 , said former @entity4 @entity6 czar @entity93 , who teaches at @entity94			1
@entity24 was launched to study whether the @entity6 environment ever had conditions suitable for microbial life			2
the voyage to @entity6 took over eight months and spanned 352 million miles			0
the trickiest part of the journey ? the landing			0
because @entity24 weighs nearly a ton , engineers drummed up a new and more controlled way to set the rover down			2
the last @entity6 rovers , twins @entity106 , were cocooned in air bags and bounced to a stop in 2004			0
the plans for @entity24 called for a series of braking tricks , similar to those used by the space shuttle , and a supersonic parachute to slow it down			0
next : ditch the heat shield used for the fiery descent			0
and in a new twist , engineers came up with a way to lower the rover by cable from a hovering rocket - powered backpack			2
at touchdown , the cords cut and the rocket stage crashes a distance away			0
the nuclear - powered @entity24 , the size of a small car , is packed with scientific tools , cameras and a weather station			0
it sports a robotic arm with a power drill , a laser that can zap distant rocks , a chemistry lab to sniff for the chemical building blocks of life and a detector to measure dangerous radiation on the surface			1
it also tracked radiation levels during the journey to help @entity4 better understand the risks astronauts could face on a future manned trip			1
after several weeks of health checkups , the six - wheeled rover could take its first short drive and flex its robotic arm			2
monitoring : @entity155 , data controller , monitors the @entity24 from the @entity158 's control room at @entity4 's @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , thursday , august 2 , 2012 the landing site near @entity6 ' equator was picked because there are signs of water everywhere , meeting one of the requirements for life as we know it			1
inside @entity168 is a 3 - mile - high mountain , and images from space show the base appears rich in minerals that formed in the presence of water			2
previous trips to @entity6 have uncovered ice near the @entity6 north pole and evidence that water once flowed when the planet was wetter and toastier unlike today 's harsh , frigid desert environment			1
@entity24 's goal : to scour for basic ingredients essential for life , including carbon , nitrogen , phosphorous , sulfur and oxygen			1
it 's not equipped to search for living or fossil microorganisms			1
to get a definitive answer , a future mission needs to fly @entity6 rocks and soil back to @entity79 to be examined by powerful laboratories			2
the mission comes as @entity4 retools its @entity6 exploration strategy			1
faced with tough economic times , the space agency pulled out of partnership with the @entity202 to land a rock - collecting rover in 2018			1
the @entity204 have since teamed with the @entity205 as @entity4 decides on a new roadmap			1
despite @entity6 ' reputation as a spacecraft graveyard , humans continue their love affair with the planet , lobbing spacecraft in search of clues about its early history			1
out of more than three dozen attempts - flybys , orbiters and landings - by the @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity204 and @entity223 since the 1960s , more than half have ended disastrously			0
one @entity4 rover that defied expectations is opportunity , which is still busy wheeling around the rim of a crater in the @entity228 eight years later			1

rover *scheduled* to land at @entity232 ( est ) or @entity233 ( *gmt* ) on monday *morning*
scientists say they are ' *cautiously* *optimistic* '
@entity237 will show @entity4 coverage , while @entity239 will *webcast* it
@entity241 will search for signs of life on the red planet 's surface using a scoop to dig into the soil
