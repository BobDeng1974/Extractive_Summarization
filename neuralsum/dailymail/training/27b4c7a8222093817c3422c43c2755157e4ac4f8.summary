council bosses have been accused of ' vandalising ' one of the most beautiful medieval villages in @entity3 by ripping up its cobbled streets and replacing them with mass - produced paving stones			1
the historic paths are considered iconic in the village of @entity9 in @entity10 , which is featured in the @entity11 and may date back to the @entity12			1
but residents are furious after the cobbles - said to be a danger to pedestrians - were removed in favour of a dull grey pavement , which some say looks like ' a new housing estate '			1
transformation : the cobbled streets of @entity9 , left , have been replaced with bland paving stones , right fury : local residents say the renovations are out of character with their historic surroundings although the centre of the roads have long been paved with tarmac to allow cars to drive on them , their edges were until recently made from historic cobblestones			1
following complaints about pedestrians slipping on the uneven surfaces , the councils responsible for the village decided to replace them with a smoother pavement			1
but even those locals who supported the removal of the cobbles say that the new surface is completely inappropriate for its picturesque context			0
@entity48 , who has lived in the village his whole life , said : ' they look like concrete , nothing like the red sandstone that the whole village is built from , and they 're machine cut with no history			0
' the 70 - year - old added : ' the understanding was that it would be like what was done in the @entity62 , which has weathered down and looks fine			0
' these are very different stones and everyone in the street is up in arms , we are really upset , it looks like a path on a new housing estate			0
' works : the cobbles are being ripped out after pedestrians complained that they were dangerous controversy : in 2011 , another set of cobbles , left , were replaced by new paving stones , right - but locals say the new project is even worse shop owner @entity81 called the move ' an act of deliberate vandalism , ' adding : ' @entity9 is a national treasure and this is a national disgrace			1
' the village attracts hundreds of visitors every year because it is so well preserved , as well as being home to a 400 - year - old castle			2
in 2011 , the local council sparked a national outcry when it replaced the cobbles flanking @entity9 's @entity62 with paving stones imported from @entity95			1
however , residents say that the new project - centred around the older @entity98 - is even worse than the previous controversy , as the stones are more homogenous than those used four years ago			1
shop owner @entity81 said : ' @entity9 is probably @entity104 's largest and most intact medieval village , ' she said			1
' it is a national treasure and as such we are unique			0
' we do n't want the more expensive , perfectly cut stone which just does n't fit with our charming and quirky village			0
' picturesque : the village , shown here in the 1990s , is considered one of the best - preserved in @entity3 @entity112 , chairman of the parish council , said that the issue would be debated at a forthcoming meeting			1
because of the village 's historic status , @entity116 has to be consulted over many major planning decisions - prompting many villagers to blame the conservation body for the botched renovations			1
but a spokesman for the organisation insisted that it was only consulted on matters required planning permission , and had therefore not been asked to weigh in on the project			0
@entity129 of @entity116 said : ' we have only just become aware of the replacement of cobbles to pavements in @entity98 , @entity9 and had not received any request for our advice on the works from the local authority			2
' we have therefore expressed no opinion on either the principle of the works or the detail of how they would be undertaken , including the selection of stone			0
' the scheme was apparently proposed by the @entity145 , which includes @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and the local parish council			0
a spokesman for the county council said : ' we are fully aware of the historical importance of @entity9 and the decision to replace some of the cobbles is in response to local concerns over safety and accessibility			2
' the materials being used are locally sourced and fully approved by conservation officers , and the appearance of the stone will change as it weathers			0
' @entity9 is located near the site of two @entity12 hill forts , @entity166 and @entity165 - their exact age is unknown , but they could be as much as 3,000 years old			2
the village itself was first recorded in the @entity172 , the first ever thorough land survey of @entity104 , and was originally known as ' @entity174 ' , meaning ' hill '			0
it is thought to have gained its full name thanks to a link with a local @entity180 landowner named @entity181 , but after the @entity183 it passed into the hands of powerful noble @entity185			0
the @entity183 landlord built the original @entity187 on an outcrop overlooking the village , but it was largely rebuilt in the 17th century as a @entity191 - style manor house , and thoroughly renovated in the @entity193 period			2
@entity9 was for centuries a major centre for the wool trade , making its own variety of the material which is particularly thick			2
the importance of the trade in village life is shown by the @entity202 , above right , a distinctive 400 - year - old building standing in the centre of @entity9 .			1

historic village of @entity9 has kept its cobbled - lined streets for centuries
but council has decided they are a danger to pedestrians and must be removed in favour of grey paving stones
residents say the new pavements are ugly and *unsuitable* for the village
