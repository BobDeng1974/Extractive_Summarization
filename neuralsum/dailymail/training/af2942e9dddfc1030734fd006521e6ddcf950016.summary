by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 5 december 2013 @entity1 has left itself open to fresh ridicule by putting the faux memoir of a cult film character in its ' non-fiction ' section - weeks after labelling the @entity7 fiction			1
staff at a branch near to @entity10 appeared to not realise that @entity11 : let me off at the @entity13 was a work of comic fiction about @entity17 's cinema anchorman			1
it comes after the retail chain was forced into a humbling apology after a @entity22 pastor tweeted a photo showing copies of the @entity7 labelled as fiction			1
non-fiction : @entity17 as @entity11 in @entity11			0
@entity1 has been left red faced after mislabelling the character 's faux - memoir as ' non-fiction ' , weeks after outraging @entity31 by labelling the @entity7 fiction that mistake had led some devout @entity31 to attempt to organise a boycott of @entity1 , which blamed the error on its distributor			1
the latest gaffe was spotted by @entity39 columnist @entity38 on a recent visit to her local @entity1			1
but charitably she said she ' ca n't totally blame @entity1 for mislabelling ' the book			1
' the cover of this book sports a picture of a mega-mustachioed @entity17 , in character as @entity44 ’s fictional tv anchorman , ' she wrote			2
' if you are n’t a reader , do n’t know anything about popular culture and perhaps have n’t been to the movies in a decade , it ’s perfectly understandable that you might slap a “ nonfiction ” label on this faux memoir			0
' perhaps @entity1 , or its distributor , believes that @entity11 is real			1
' fiction : pastor @entity59 ( right ) was surprised to find bibles at his local @entity1 labeled as ' fiction ' her sympathetic perspective was very different to the outrage from fundamentalist @entity31 over the mislabelled bibles publicised by @entity67 - based pastor @entity59 last month			1
' @entity69 i 'm sorry ... but the # @entity70 is not fiction			2
i will not be buying your goods as a result			0
# @entity75 , ' wrote @entity76 on the micro-blogging website			0
@entity78 added : ' very disappointed in costco stores			0
a bible should never be in the fiction section			0
my faith is not " fictional " thank you			0
' the chain quickly apologised for the label , saying that a distributor had made a mistake on a small batch of the @entity65 and that they would be immediately addressing the issue			2
' we take responsibility and should have caught the mistake			0
we are correcting this with them for future distribution , ' @entity1 said			2
' we greatly apologize for the error			0

branch near @entity10 apparently did not realise the book was fiction
comes after @entity31 *threatened* to boycott @entity1 over @entity7 gaffe
retail chain was forced into humbling apology over that mistake
