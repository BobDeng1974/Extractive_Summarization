the @entity0 said @entity1 would attempt to introduce the tax as soon as they took power if elected @entity1 is to seek to introduce its mansion tax on expensive homes from day one of regaining power , @entity4 suggested last night			1
the shadow @entity0 said he hoped to hit better - off homeowners in the 2015 - 16 financial year , even though that starts a month before the may general election			1
it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year , but mr @entity4 said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the @entity20 as quickly as possible			1
the coalition sought to undermine mr @entity4 ’s pledge to £ 2.5bn for the @entity20 through a combination of the mansion tax , a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £ 3bn boost at the autumn statement			1
critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next @entity35			2
but mr @entity4 , in an interview with the @entity43 , said : ‘ saving the @entity20 will be at the heart of our first budget			2
i would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a @entity1 government , before the end of the financial year			1
we will have to see the practicalities			0
’ mr @entity4 has asked the @entity47 to start preparations for such a tax before the election			2
the @entity0 denied this would amount to retrospective legislation			0
‘ a charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year			0
we will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto			0
no one will have any doubt about our intentions , ’ he insisted			0
‘ i am sure that the @entity47 will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this			0
’ if unable to impose the tax that early , mr @entity4 said @entity1 would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year , 2016 - 17 , ‘ as a backstop ’			1
@entity1 ’s mansion tax will be about £ 3,000 a year for homes in the £ 2m to £ 3m bracket , with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties			2
the proposal has been criticised by most of the @entity72 in the running to be the next mayor of @entity75 , given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax			0
critics warned @entity1 would not be able to see the revenues from such changes so quickly after the election the @entity82 have branded it a ‘ homes tax ’ and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues			1
chancellor @entity87 dramatically increased stamp duty on properties worth more than £ 1m in the autumn statement , meaning those buying the most expensive homes face a double whammy if @entity1 wins power and applies an annual mansion tax on top			0
the timing of mr balls ’ announcement is aimed at out - manoeuvring claims the revenue from a mansion tax would not start flowing soon enough - jeopardising @entity1 ’s pledge to spend £ 2.5bn more on the @entity20 than the conservatives			1
the rest of the increase in spending would come from a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds .			0

@entity4 said @entity1 wanted to introduce tax at start of next financial year
said the party wanted to raise money for @entity20 as soon as possible
critics warned revenues would need be seen so quickly in new year
