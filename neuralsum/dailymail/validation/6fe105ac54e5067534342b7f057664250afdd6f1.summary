@entity1 car - maker @entity0 has launched its new @entity3 compact sports saloon in spectacular fashion with the world 's first dramatic ' high - wire drive ' over water on cables just an inch thick			1
in a stunt worthy of the latest @entity13 movie @entity11 – for which the firm is supplying many of the cars – the new @entity3 was revealed during a dramatic ' high - wire ' water crossing in the heart of @entity20 's business district			1
the feat took place high over the @entity23 in @entity20 's @entity24 today			2
@entity31 drove the all - new @entity3 240metres across a high - wire to demonstrate the new @entity3 's lightweight aluminium - intensive construction and agility			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' the dramatic drive across two 34mm - diameter wires suspended high above water , highlights the lightweight and agile credentials of the new xf			1
' the high - wire feat is also a fitting symbol for the sort of high - wire act @entity1 's @entity0 is performing for real to take on far bigger @entity63 rivals @entity64 and @entity65			1
the company 's new @entity3 sport saloon promises ' business class ' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines			2
it is being built at @entity77 's @entity76 factory in @entity78			0
following its high - wire reveal , it makes its official global debut at the @entity83 motor show on april 1 before going on - sale from @entity84 2015			1
@entity0 says the new xf is 80kgs lighter than its closest competitor thanks to its aluminium - intensive construction			2
this has helped create fuel efficiency of more than 70mpg with @entity90 emissions of 104g/km : ' this is the lowest co2 emissions of any non-hybrid model in the segment			0
' engines include a frugal new 2.0litre 163 horse - power @entity96 diesel to a 380 horse - power @entity99 supercharged petrol			0
crew members help position the car on the wires during the lead - up to the stunt filmed in @entity24 today a @entity0 weight was dangled beneath the vehicle to help keep its balance as it is driven over the @entity109 @entity0 says the new xf will deliver ' an unrivalled blend of refinement , fuel economy , dynamics and design ' to the business car segment			1
the firm said : ' the next generation @entity3 is completely new from the ground up and will be the second @entity0 model to use the brand 's advanced aluminium - intensive architecture			1
the all - new xf will set new business segment benchmarks for weight and efficiency , resulting in class leading fuel economy figures of over 70mpg			0
' they added : ' the all - new @entity3 retains its predecessor 's core attributes but uses @entity0 's advanced aluminium - intensive architecture to elevate them to a completely new level '			1
some 75 per cent of the new car 's superstructure is made of aluminium , saving up to 190kg weight			0
this wide shot shows the vehicle driven across the river in the daring stunt performed today to launch the new vehicle an assistant dangling by a harness is belayed over to the vehicle to remove its covers for the start of the stunt nearby traffic came to a standstill in the area this morning as workers stopped to gaze at the remarkable stunt the proportions have also been tweaked			0
so although the new car is 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than the car it replaces , the new @entity3 has a 51mm longer wheelbase – the gap between the wheels - which means more rear seat space with more legroom , knee - room and headroom			2
powering the new cat , engines include 163 horse - power and 180 horse - power 2.0litre @entity96 diesel engines linked to six - speed manual - and eight - speed automatic gear - box transmissions			0

there is also a powerful 3.0litre 300 horse - power @entity99 twin - turbo diesel engine and a 3.0litre 380 horse - power @entity99 supercharged petrol engine			0
@entity0 says the lightweight body structure , electric power assisted steering , and specially tuned driving dynamics on the rear - wheel drive car help deliver ' the ideal balance between agility , comfort and refinement '			2
