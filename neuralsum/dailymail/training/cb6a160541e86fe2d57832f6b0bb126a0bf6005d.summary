he still has the power to excite , exhilarate — and court controversy			2
@entity4 ’s long - awaited , vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation			1
housed in the @entity7 ’s 17th - century @entity6 — the former home of a salt - tax collector — it ’s an enormous , elegant space , and @entity4 ’s work fills it to the rafters			1
the man behind the magic : some of @entity4 's finest works are found in the @entity16 museum of his art i had a sneak preview			1
there are 5,000 pieces , illustrating the breadth of his repertoire , from early paintings to found - object sculptures , collages and shocking nudes			0
the collection was given to @entity16 in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by @entity4 ’s heirs			1
a visitor stands in front of the painting ' woman throwing a @entity37 ' and the sculptures ( @entity39 ) ' @entity40 ' , ' bust of a woman ' and ' @entity42 ' by @entity43 painter @entity4 ( 1881 - 1973 ) @entity4 's painting ' @entity45 ' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening housed in the @entity7 ’s 17th - century @entity6 — the former home of a salt - tax collector — the museum is an enormous , elegant space			1
@entity4 ’s work fills it to the rafters of his masterpieces , there are studies for @entity58 ( the finished work is in @entity61 ’s @entity60 ) and a series of photos by his lover @entity64 showing the artist working on @entity66			1
@entity67 , made from a bicycle seat , casts an eerie shadow , and two women running on a beach is sheer joy			0
the quietly shattering cubist rendering of the @entity74 is here			1
i particularly like the striking portrait of @entity64 in lurid greens , yellows and streaks of coral			0
a leafy place to escape : @entity81 is an excellent @entity16 base for a visit to the @entity6 an old - fashioned sort of refinement : the hotel revels in a classic style of glamour the attic is given over to masters , including @entity91 and @entity92 , as well as @entity4 ’s contemporaries , such as his rival @entity94			1
you get a lot for your money — entry is just £ 8 — and there ’s something for everyone			0
the museum should inspire you to delve further into @entity4 ’s @entity16 life			1
he arrived here , aged 19 , in 1900 , for the @entity105 , where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show			0
you can now dine in the @entity110 in the @entity111 , built for the event			0
@entity4 first settled in @entity113 — as seedy and provocative now as it was then			1
his studio in the @entity116 ( ‘ @entity117 ’ ) was destroyed by fire in 1970 , but you can visit the site on @entity116			0
it does n’t look much and it was squalid in @entity4 ’s day , which suited him in his scruffy overalls			1
the simplistically - titled sculpture ' @entity125 ' is one of @entity4 's more intriguing works bleak and brutally to the point : @entity4 's ' @entity129 ' pulls no punches back with a bang after five long years of renovation : visitors look at the painting ' @entity135 ' here he painted @entity58 and held a party for the artist @entity138 , at which the critic @entity139 reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches			1
below and above the @entity116 are the theatres where @entity4 and @entity145 spent their evenings — @entity4 was apparently ejected from the @entity113 for throwing sausages			2
the @entity148 , that diminutive red windmill on the @entity150 , continues to put on a show outside and in			0
the @entity152 , painted by @entity91 and @entity4 , is now a starched - looking restaurant on @entity154			2
in focus : the sculpture ' @entity157 ' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching come in and take a look : ' the woman with an @entity163 ' sculpture is a shard of @entity4 in minimalist form the museum 's collection - including the ' @entity169 ' sculpture - was given to @entity16 in lieu of inheritance tax directly opposite is @entity172 , a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken , chips and salad for £ 12 , a glass of riesling for £ 5.50 and @entity179 ( floating island , one of @entity4 ’s favourite desserts ) for £ 8			1
behind the thronging @entity183 , busy with tourists day and night , is the @entity185 on attractive @entity186			0
the paintings ' @entity187 in a @entity189 ' and ' three women at the @entity191 ' are key parts of the collection a tribute : ' the death of @entity196 ' acknowledges @entity4 's solid friendship with the titular @entity199 artist @entity4 at his most playful : ' women in the bathroom ' is an example of the great artist in lighter form a welcome : @entity16 's timeless buzz of @entity16 will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the @entity6 the museum ’s building , a mid- 17th - century house , is the oldest in @entity113			1
it overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the @entity216 cabaret , where @entity4 ’s gang caroused			2
it was originally a hunting lodge for @entity219 , then a tavern frequented by gangsters			0
you can sip absinthe , and the show begins at 9pm			0
the museum gives an impression of what @entity227 looked like at the turn of the 20th century , with landscapes and photos showing the building of the @entity74			2
there are also photos of local artists — @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity4 , in his @entity116 studio			2
the ivy - clad hotel @entity241 is a ten - minute walk away from the @entity6			0
just off @entity244 , it ’s convenient for wassailing in the @entity7 and recovering from a day on your feet			0
@entity16 is proud of @entity4 — and rightly so			1
the city was the scene of some of his greatest work , and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes			0
@entity81 , ( 0033 1 40 291 919 , www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com ) offers two - night breaks on a bed - and - breakfast basis - with two tickets for the @entity6 and a self - guided city walking tour - for £ 700 ( based on two sharing ) excluding city tax			2
return fares with @entity263 cost from £ 69 per person ( 03432 186 186 ; www.eurostar.com )			0
tickets to the @entity6 ( @entity6 , @entity265 ; 0033 1 8556 0036 ; www.museepicassoparis.fr ) cost 11 € .			0

the @entity267 @entity4 finally reopens after five years of renovations
collection was given to @entity16 in lieu of inheritance tax by the artist 's heirs
his @entity275 rendering of the *iconic* @entity74 is a particular *highlight*
