@entity0 was given his first - ever competitive start for @entity2 in the @entity4 final but the desperately unlucky defensive midfielder had to be taken off after 31 minutes with a head injury			1
the 23 - year - old 's full debut was cut short after he violently clashed his head with @entity12 centre - back @entity10 's shoulder 17 minutes in , leaving him requiring treatment			1
@entity0 looked disorientated as he was taken off for @entity14 after playing on for nearly 15 minutes and arguably should have been substituted earlier by @entity2 manager @entity15			1
scroll down for @entity17 's full analysis and verdict of @entity2 's @entity0 ouch : @entity0 gets hit in the face by @entity12 's @entity10 's shoudler with @entity21 behind him out : @entity0 lies on the pitch at the @entity23 after suffering a head injury during the @entity4 final dazed : @entity0 looked like he was struggling after the violent hit to the head during the @entity4 showdown confused : @entity0 looks dazed after the clash which was enough to have him substituted after half an hour substituted : @entity0 is taken off for @entity14 after trying to carry on with the injury @entity31 : february 19 1991 ( age 23 ) 2010 - 2011 : @entity33 2011 - now : @entity33 2011 - 2013 : @entity34 ( loan ) 2013 - now : @entity36 ( loan ) 2014 - now : @entity2 scroll down for a full analysis of @entity0 it was unfortunate for @entity0 , who was only given his first start for @entity2 after @entity42 star @entity41 was ruled out with a calf injury in the warm up			1
@entity0 's injury came via @entity10 as the pair challenged for a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area			1
the @entity36 loan player was visibly dazed from the blow and continued to look so as he was substituted			0
@entity0 was n't selected as part of @entity15 's provisional squad for the @entity4 at the beginning of may , but was included as a back up to the likes of @entity41 and @entity56			1
@entity57 : @entity0 looked relaxed ahead of the @entity4 final as he spun the ball in the tunnel in the thick of it : @entity0 tackles @entity62 during the @entity4 final before being substituted in the space of just a couple of hours , @entity63 midfielder @entity0 has endured the full range of emotions , enjoying a stroke of huge personal fortune , as @entity41 's niggle in the warm - up to the @entity4 final against @entity12 handed him a first competitive start on the grandest stage			1
then , however , he suffered a cruel twist of fate , as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half - an - hour			0
here , @entity17 provides all you need to know about the unfortunate @entity0 ...			0
so tell me a little bit about @entity0 , the poor @entity63 who headed off the pitch just half - an - hour into the @entity82 ... the @entity63 central midfielder is 23 years old and enjoyed a breakthrough season in the @entity85 on loan at @entity36 , as his side finished sixth in the top flight			2
he emerged through the youth team at @entity33 , where he will return to next season , and is recognised as one of the standout talents in @entity2 after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division with @entity34			0
what kind of player is he ? an indefatigable midfielder , who works relentlessly in the central positions for his team			0
he does much of the unseen work and he is not dissimilar in style to @entity41 , who he replaced after the warm up in the @entity4 final			1
so has he been a fixture in the @entity2 national squad ? no , @entity0 was n't even picked in @entity15 's first provisional squad for the @entity4 at the beginning of may			1
however , the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as players such as @entity41 and @entity56 recovered from injury , while @entity112 had already been ruled out			0
@entity0 replaced forward @entity113 in the squad and then impressed in training to such an extent that he was included in the 23 - man pool for @entity118			2
has he been called into action at the @entity4 ? he has barely featured , appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute against both @entity121 and @entity122			0
the @entity4 final on sunday evening marked his first competitive start for @entity2			1
that seems like a brutal induction ... ? well , it was n't planned that way			0
@entity41 pulled up in the warm up and @entity15 handed @entity0 the nod			2
sadly , though , it was destined to be a short - lived experience			0
how was he injured ? @entity132 defender @entity10 crashed into @entity0 as the two challenged a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area			2
it was a really heavy collision and @entity0 looked visibly disorientated and was then replaced after just 30 minutes			2
at 23 , we 're sure that he will be back for more in future major tournaments .			0

@entity0 makes first - ever competitive start for @entity2
@entity0 replaced @entity41 , who was injured in warm up for @entity4 final against @entity12 at @entity23 in @entity144
