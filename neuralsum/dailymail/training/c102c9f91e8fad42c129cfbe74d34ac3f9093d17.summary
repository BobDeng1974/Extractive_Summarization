a wartime codebreaker has revealed she and her co-workers at @entity3 dried their bras and knickers on @entity7 's enigma machine during night shifts at the cypher school			1
@entity11 ' @entity10 , 88 , joined the @entity12 when she was 17 and was handpicked to work on the top secret team under code genius @entity14			1
she said women at the chilly school would dry their damp underpants on the huge computers linked to the seized @entity6 as they were the only source of heat at night			1
her saucy secret comes days before the november 14 general release of the @entity25 film , which stars @entity26 as @entity14			1
left , @entity27 pictured as a 17 - year - old when she started work codebreaking at @entity3 , and right , as a 88 - year - old			1
she has now revealed some of the secrets on the @entity12 mrs @entity10 said : ' one thing i remember was that during night shifts the enigma machine was the only warm thing about , so we used to wash our smalls and hang them around it to dry			1
' it used to be festooned with bras and pants all through our night duty			1
back then it must have looked a real sight			2
' her father had to give his permission for her join the @entity12 in 1944 because she was under 18			2
she spent six weeks training in @entity50 before being assigned to ' @entity51 ' and posted to the secret facility near @entity53 , @entity54			2
she spent up to 10 hours a day sifting through reams of code and said they were never told where their work had actually succeeded			0
the women were even forbidden from talking to each other about their individuals parts of the puzzle			2
here mrs @entity10 is pictured with a group of friends at @entity3 , where she and her fellow @entity12 would laugh when they spotted @entity14 walking across the grounds backwards while reading books mrs @entity10 , pictured left and right in 1944 while she was based at @entity3 at a 17 - year - old , signed up for the @entity12 in the hope of finding adventure mrs @entity10 said : ' we were given long strips of paper tape made by the enigma machine and told to divide everything into fives			1
' we used to get codes for the day , one i can remember is @entity79 , a @entity81 code for man			0
there were so many of them i ca n't remember , but i 've always remembered that one			0
' none of us knew everything that we were working on			0
we each knew a bit , our own part of the puzzle , so if you were caught , you could n't tell them everything , even if they tortured you			0
' we were told never to discuss with anyone else what we were doing			0
' we never knew anything			0
we never knew what we had done , or if we had helped to actually crack the codes			0
' i never even told my parents because we signed the @entity102 , so they died without ever finding out what i was doing			0
' mrs @entity10 ( pictured ) said @entity14 should be formally recognised for his code breaking work			1
here she is pictured with awards she received thanking her for her service earlier this year mrs @entity10 returned to visit @entity3 as an 88 - year - old ( pictured )			1
she spent 18 months at the grounds breaking codes during the @entity111 mrs @entity10 , from @entity112 , @entity113 , said she and her fellow @entity12 would see @entity14 walking about the grounds - often backwards as he read a book			1
she said : ' we used to see @entity14 from time to time , and back then we used to giggle and laugh			1
' we used to watch him walk backwards sometimes while reading a book , and we could n't help but giggle at him for how he acted			1
she explained they all though he was strange - but a genius			0
' i feel the government should formally recognise him for his work during the war			0
he did so much and his name has not yet appeared anywhere really			0
it 's too late for him now , but people should know what he did			0
' he was pushed into the background , but all these people with these brilliant minds were a bit different in their own way			0
' mathematical genius @entity14 's invention helped save countless @entity142 lives the @entity6 was a machine developed by the @entity144 which enabled them to send official military and strategic communications in scrambled code			1
using a complicated system of rotors , the machine would encode messages before sending them via @entity148 to another machine			0
if the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered			0
however the team of cryptologists , linguists , scientists and data analysts at @entity163 , in @entity54 , led by @entity164 , were able to break it			2
it was thwarted in part thanks to @entity14 's ' @entity168 , which was able to speed up the code - breaking process immeasurably			2
@entity14 based his invention on a @entity172 device , the ' @entity173 ' , which was handed over to @entity174 just weeks before @entity172 was invaded in 1939			1
as @entity178 himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from @entity3 every day , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave @entity174 a crucial edge in battle .			2

@entity11 ' @entity10 said @entity3 was *freezing* cold at night
the women in the team *resorted* to drying their bras and pants on @entity6
she said it was ' festooned with bras and pants all through our night duty '
mrs @entity10 worked in @entity3 with @entity14
she said he was often spotted walked backwards while reading a book
movie based on @entity14 and the codebreakers to be released friday
