' local politicians want an annual twin festival for people such as @entity77 , left , and @entity78 , right at least 21 sets of twins were born during the civil war , pictured @entity81 , left , and @entity83 right some experts believe the high number of twins could be genetic , pictured , @entity87 and @entity88 according to doctors at the local hospital , a set of twins can be expected once in every 88 births			1
