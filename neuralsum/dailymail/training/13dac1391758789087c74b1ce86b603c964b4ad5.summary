@entity9 dropped off a few hundred metres from the line , leaving @entity0 and @entity35 to fight it out			1
almost within sight of the line , @entity0 made her break and the 25 - year - old from @entity45 in the @entity46 pulled away to take victory			2
a battle between @entity1 and @entity49 had been highly anticipated , but injuries to world champion @entity51 and @entity52 ended @entity49 medal hopes			2
it was still a strong field , though , with seven of the world 's top 12 this season in action			0
as expected , the @entity1 trio pushed the pace on the 1.5 - kilometres swim in @entity60 , with @entity61 coming out of the water first ahead of @entity9 and @entity0			1
great support : fans in @entity65 cheer on @entity0 down the back straight as she storms to victory congratulations : even @entity6 of @entity7 could n't help but be proud for the 25 - year - old on your bike : @entity0 was in the leading pack from the outset , and kicked strongly to defeat the field they formed a leading group on the bike with @entity80 's @entity79 and @entity82 's @entity81 , but before long the chasers caught up to form a group of 10 that included all the main challengers			1
it stayed that way until the latter stages of the fourth lap , when @entity61 made her break , and initially she opened up a decent gap , but by the time they finished the 40km ride they were all back together			0
@entity9 set out first on the run but @entity0 quickly moved to the front to push the pace and start reducing the pack			1
@entity0 said on @entity100 : ' it 's just overwhelming			2
all my family 's here and for them to get to be part of it with me is fantastic			0
' the injured @entity49 triathlete @entity51 embraced @entity0 after the race			2
we 're underway : the triathletes dive into the water to start the event in @entity22 on thursday on the march ? @entity9 of @entity1 leads her comaptriot @entity0 out of the water next step : the athletes take to the bike to begin a tough stint @entity0 added : ' we 're a really close team out there and to get another @entity1 girl on the podium is fantastic			1
' i was most worried about the swim because i know how strong ( @entity1 team - mate ) @entity125 is			0
' if i was n't there it was going to be an extremely hard race for me to get there			0
but i had an awesome swim and the bike was challenging , but it was just trying to be aware really			0
' the toughest bit was the run			0
i wanted to go out strong but quickly realised that so did everybody else and they were n't going to let me run away with it			0
' it was a case of , " be sensible , keep running strong and see who 's with me on the last half of a lap "			0
' and then at the top of the hill when i started the descent it was , ' right , let 's give it all i 've got ' , and it came off			0
