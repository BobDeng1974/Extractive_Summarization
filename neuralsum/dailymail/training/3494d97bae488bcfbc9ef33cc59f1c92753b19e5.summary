by @entity1 reporter published : 21:44 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 14 december 2012 modern day inventor : @entity3 , co-inventor with @entity4 of the bar code that labels nearly every product in stores today , died on sunday at the age of 91 scanned more than five million times a day , instantaneously encoding product data while boosting work production , it was with @entity3 's fingers in the sand that he first invented the revolutionizing bar code			1
mr @entity3 , deemed co-inventor of the what was originally a circular emblem of lines that would later become responsible for nearly every product labeling in stores , died on sunday at the age of 91			1
suffering the effect @entity22 and complications of his advanced age in his home in @entity26 , @entity27 , his daughter , @entity28 of @entity29 , announced his death on thursday			1
as an undergraduate student at what 's now called @entity35 in @entity36 , it was after later co-inventor @entity4 overheard a grocery - store executive 's pleas to the engineering school 's dean for students for help			2
his request was an invention that would quickly capture product information at checkout that both were inspired , according to @entity28			0
@entity3 notably had worked on the @entity48 , the @entity50 military 's atomic bomb development team			0
after having already earned a mechanical engineering degree , @entity3 dropped out of graduate school to work on the bar code idea			1
he stole away to spend time with his grandfather in @entity56 to focus on developing a code that could symbolically capture details about an item , @entity28			0
patented : mr @entity3 's original 1952 patent for the bar code , pictured left , was circular allowing it to be scanned from any direction while right , a device capable of reading it is seen modernized : @entity66 promoted a rectangular barcode to the inventors ' circular version , leading to a standard for universal product code , or @entity73 , technology the only code @entity3 knew was the @entity77 he 'd learned in the @entity78 , his daughter said			1
one day , he drew @entity77 dots and dashes as he sat on the beach and absent - mindedly left his fingers in the sand where they traced a series of parallel lines			0
' it was a moment of inspiration			0
he said , ' instead of dots and dashes i can have thick and thin bars , '' @entity28 said			0
@entity3 and @entity4 submitted their patent in 1949 for a code patterned on concentric circles that looked like a bull 's eye			1
the patent was issued in 1952 , 60 years ago this fall			0
both eventually sold their patent for $ 15,000 to @entity99 , making the most they ever received from their patent			1
@entity3 joined @entity66 in 1951 hoping to develop the bar code , but the technology was n't accepted for more than two decades until lasers made it possible to read the code readily , the technology company said			1
in the early 1970s , @entity3 moved to @entity107 to join a team at @entity66 's @entity109 , @entity110 , facility			0
about 10 years after the patent had expired , the team developed a bar - code - reading laser scanner system in response to demand from grocers ' desires to automate and speed checkout while also cutting handling and inventory management costs			2
solution : appealing to grocers ' desires to speed up checkout , @entity66 developed a bar - code - reading laser scanner system , one right , capable of reading them at little expense modernizing the code into a universal symbol , seen tattooed left challenge : a @entity130 , developed in @entity131 , is growing in competition to the original @entity73 code while this one can be scanned using cell phones @entity66 promoted a rectangular barcode that led to a standard for universal product code technology			2
the first product sold using a @entity73 scan was a 67 - cent package of @entity142 's chewing gum at a supermarket in @entity144 , @entity145 , in june 1974 , according to @entity146 , the @entity50 affiliate of the global standard - setting @entity73 body			2
today , about 5 billion products are scanned and tracked worldwide every day			0
@entity3 was born sept 6 , 1921 , in @entity149 , @entity27 @entity3 and @entity151 founder @entity150 were among those honored at the @entity153 in 1992 for their achievements to technology , four months after president @entity156 appeared amazed at a demonstration of a grocery checkout machine .			2

@entity3 died on sunday in his @entity27 home after suffering @entity22 's *disease*
original 1952 patent for bar code *favoured* a circle - allowing scan from any direction
patent sold for $ 15,000 making the most ever earned by @entity3 or co-inventor
