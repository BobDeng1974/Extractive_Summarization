a @entity1 teacher who claims she was gang - raped in @entity2 today broke her silence to say that police had treated the attack as a joke			1
the 20 - year - old , who had only been in the country for two weeks , said that officers had made out she was ' some drunk idiot '			1
and she said that the situation was made even worse by allegations that she had not been attacked and was only crying rape			1
' i think i 'm still in shock			2
the first night after i was raped i was very upset , i was tired and cried quite a lot , ' she said ' now , i ca n't cry , i just feel numb			2
as soon as i enter my family 's company i think i will just break down			0
' the alleged scene of the crime : police comb the second - floor balcony of the building in @entity24 , @entity2 , where a @entity1 student was found weeping the woman , who is from @entity27 , was allegedly attacked by four men and raped by two of them as she walked home from a night out at around 3am on friday			1
speaking from the city of @entity24 in the south of the country , she said : '' i had had a few beers at a restaurant with a friend and we moved on to a bar where i met another friend			1
' i can remember a lot of that then things are unclear , i can only remember little things			0
' i do not know if my drink had been spiked or what			0
there was a kafuffle with the bouncer there and we left at around 2.45am			0
' i told my friend that i would get back home fine , it was not too far away			1
the police have told me that i was told to leave the bar because i was too drunk , but i ca n't remember if that was true			1
' i was awoken on the balcony of a building around 50m away from the bar			1
allegations : the @entity1 student said she was gang - raped in @entity24 , southern @entity2 ' the police and other people that lived nearby woke me up			1
at that point , i did not have a clue what had happened or what was going on , but they were saying i was still drunk			1
' the woman added that she had a clear description of two of her attackers			0
she said : ' i do not remember certain parts of what happened , and i do not remember what order they are in			0
' i can remember a silver car or a pick - up truck and i think that is what the men who attacked me drove in			1
' i remember it was raining , i remember there were four of them and i remember the attack happened on a concrete floor			0
' i remember quite clearly what the two men who raped me looked like			1
' one was wearing a black t - shirt and the other was wearing a green khaki t - shirt , he had black hair and a gap in his teeth or a tooth missing			0

there are bruises on my arms from where they held me down and my elbows and knees have been scraped			0

but the woman has hit out at the way the authorities have dealt with her since the assault			0
she said : ' i 've given three statements to the police using two different interpreters , i feel like i 'm going round in circles with them			1
' they tell me one thing and then another , they 've said something about a bouncer at the bar taking me home and dropping me off , but he ca n't remember where that was			1
' she added : ' i still have n't received anything back from the police , or from the hospital for tests for diseases following the attack			1
' how come no - one in nearby houses heard anything happening ? i was screaming and shouting during the attack , there 's no chance they never heard anything			0
' the police have said the people living nearby just thought it was a fight and did n't do anything			2
the police and authorities are very humiliating , their whole system has let me down			2
' they 're making out that i was some drunk idiot and it was my fault , which was not the case			1
destination : @entity2 is popular with @entity1 tourists , particularly students , with thousands visiting every year			1
' they started asking me questions about my relationship with my boyfriend , which is not relevant at all to this , it just seems like a joke to them			2
' the distraught woman is travelling home to @entity168 after the ordeal forced her to abandon plans to begin teaching in the region			1
she said : ' it 's been a horrific experience and the whole thing with the media has made it a lot worse			0
' they have made me look like an idiot who was drunk , they also said my boyfriend had left me at the bar , which he had n't			1

' what they 've reported has been quite disturbing			0
' the young woman called for her attackers to be brought to justice but said she feels like nothing will be done			0
she said : ' i hope there 's some way this can be resolved			0
those men need to be caught			2
i just really want to go home , i want to go and see my family and get proper help , but i 'm stuck in a foreign country where no - one speaks fluent @entity203			2
' when i get back to the @entity1 i want to report this to the police who will understand me and i want to go to a hospital that can help me after this			2
' my family are very supportive , they just want me home as soon as possible			2
' she added : ' leaving my boyfriend behind here because he ca n't get a @entity1 visa just now is terrible			0
' we have been living out of each others ' pockets for the past few months			0
but it has ruined everything that i had planned out here			0
' @entity220 , who owns the bar where the young woman was drinking said that he had instructed a member of security staff to escort the young woman home as she was so drunk			1
meanwhile , a witness who lives next door to the alleged victim said she heard her return home at 3.45am			1
@entity229 , 33 , said she did indeed hear a man come to her room , but he encouraged her to go downstairs for fear that she would fall from the balcony			0
