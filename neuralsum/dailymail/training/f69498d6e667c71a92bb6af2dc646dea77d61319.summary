by @entity0 published : 15:43 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 27 september 2013 the owners of a @entity3 cantaloupe farm behind one of the deadliest foodborne illness outbreaks in @entity7 history have been arrested by federal authorities			1
@entity9 , owned by @entity10 and @entity11 , was revealed to be the source of contaminated melons that killed 33 people and sickened at least 140 across 28 states in 2011			1
the @entity16 , who went bankrupt in the wake of the contamination scandal , are charged with introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce			0
' they bear a special responsibility to ensure that the food they produce and sell is not dangerous to the public			0
where they fail to live up to that responsibility , and as these charges demonstrate , this office and the @entity42 have a responsibility to act forcefully to enforce the law			0
' the @entity46 reports that federal investigators rarely pursue criminal charges against owners involved foodborne illness cases - and only if there is evidence that they knew of or ignored evidence of possible contamination			1
there has been no public indication that there was such a lapse that led to the cantilope disaster as @entity9 two years ago , according to the @entity46			0
it is unknown whether federal investigators have evidence of the @entity16 ignoring information about possible contamination			2
an investigation found that the process the @entity16 used for washing their melons allowed dirty water to pool and re-contaminate countless cantaloupes ( stock picture ) instead , investigators have questioned the methods that the @entity73 , @entity3 , farm used to cleaning the how fruit that was picked from fields			2
at the time , federal guidelines were not clear on whether melons should be washing in a bath of sanitizing solution or simply sprayed off with fresh water			1
the @entity16 had upgraded their facilities prior to the outbreak to use the fresh water method			2
however , investigators found that the process was originally meant to be used with potatoes and allowed dirty water to collect and re-contaminate the melons .			0

the 2011 *listeria* outbreak was second - deadliest foodborne illness *incident* in @entity7 history
@entity10 and @entity11 claimed they were following federal guidelines when countless melons from their @entity3 became contaminated
