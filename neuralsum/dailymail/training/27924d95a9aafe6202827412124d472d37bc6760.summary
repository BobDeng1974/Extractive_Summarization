by @entity0 published : 21:03 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 17:55 est , 12 december 2012 a plague of ‘ super rats ’ in the @entity4 can be wiped out only with considerably stronger poisons , it was claimed yesterday			1
council experts say the number of mutant rats , which are resistant to conventional poisons , is rising drastically after flooding drove them into homes and created ideal breeding conditions			1
@entity13 is asking the @entity14 to change the rules on how poison is used			1
mutant rodent : the ' super rat ' is immune to normal rat poison which has led to a fear that it may be unstoppable in spreading life - threatening diseases to humans and farm animals homes in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 have reported increased numbers of the ‘ super-rodent ’ which is resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life - threatening diseases to humans and farm animals			1
however , wildlife experts fear that if stronger poisons are allowed to be used against the rat - threat it may harm innocent local wildlife			1
the ‘ super-rats ’ population is due to increase further as the recent flooding across many parts of @entity42 has created ideal breeding conditions			2
@entity13 is lobbying the @entity14 for permission to use powerful rodenticides , brodifacoum and flocoumafen , which are currently limited to indoor use			1
@entity48 , from @entity49 in @entity50 , who is contracted by @entity13 , said : ‘ it ’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen			1
‘ they ’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons			1
‘ we have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing , which can be less effective and more costly			2
’ close relation : it is hard to distinguish the mutated strain from its cousin - the brown rat - due to their shared genetic makeup and identical appearance a study by @entity71 ’s @entity70 involving testing the tails of hundreds of rats killed in @entity25 and @entity74 , found that many of the rodents were resistant to common forms of poison used by local authorities and professional pest controllers , farmers and gamekeepers			1
other @entity84 countries allow use of brodifacoum and flocoumafen outside , but attempts to make them available in @entity42 are likely to lead to all - out war with nature lovers who fear owls , hawks and even dogs and cats will eat the rodents and ingest the poison			1
head of the study dr @entity98 said : ‘ we ’re not allowed to use them because the regulatory body is worried about their effects on wildlife			2
‘ my view is that we need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use them carefully			2
if we can do that we can solve the problem			2
’ the @entity14 is currently consulting on a @entity84 proposal to allow limited outdoor use of certain chemicals in pest control			2
the results will be published next year			0
dr @entity98 found the super rats look like their non-mutant cousins , which makes it even harder to identify them			0
he added : ‘ all rats tend to carry various diseases			0
the reason we need to get rid of them is because they transmit diseases from themselves to humans and farm animals			0
they can be life - threatening			0
‘ these anticoagulant - resistant rats carry the same diseases as other rats carry but are very difficult to control			0
’ no harm no f - owl : wildlife experts are worried that if outdoor usage of brodifacoum and flocoumafen is approved it may harm local wildlife who feed off rats , such as owls a map was drawn indicating where the rats were found , including areas of farmland around @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
exact locations have not been disclosed			0
the survey found the rats to be living in both urban and rural areas			0
farm buildings were popular habitats because the rats could live off food for livestock			0
dr @entity98 said this caused the greatest concern because the rats carry illnesses such as @entity164 ’s disease , which can be passed on to humans			0
it has flu - like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice in the kidneys			0
he said ‘ if @entity164 ’s disease is not treated it ’s very serious			0
about 40 to 50 people in the @entity42 catch it every year			0
‘ however , very often people go to the doctor with flu and are given antibiotics and it clears up so there might actually be more cases than we know about ' dr @entity98 is also concerned that wildlife including red kites , barn owls , foxes and badgers could be affected even if ‘ ordinary ’ poisons are put down - because people will use greater and greater quantities in a vain attempt to destroy the super rats , which ca n’t be killed			1
‘ they are called super-rats but they do n’t look super - they look just like any other rats			0
‘ that ’s the problem because people do n’t know they are resistant and carry on using poisons that ca n’t control them			2
‘ we ’re concerned that more and more of these poisons are getting into wildlife			1
‘ if the rats have eaten the poison and stay alive , when other animals eat them , they can get secondary poisoning			2
it can then get passed up the food chain			0
‘ there ’s no danger to humans in the movement of this poison but there ’s enough concern about it getting into wildlife			1

' @entity214 rat ' plagueing the @entity4 is immune to normal poison
@entity13 want relaxed poison laws to *exterminate* rat issue
poisons brodifacoum and flocoumafen are currently limited to indoor use due to its threat to wildlife
