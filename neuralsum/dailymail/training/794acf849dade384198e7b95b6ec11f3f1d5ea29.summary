by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 9 december 2013 worsening summer heatwaves and downpours in @entity3 and the @entity4 could be linked to a thaw in @entity7 ice			1
a report published in ‘ @entity9 ’ warned of increasingly extreme weather across ‘ much of @entity11 and @entity12 where billions of people will be affected ’			1
the study , which was dismissed as inconclusive by some experts , has intensified debate about whether human - induced global warming is responsible for climate change			0
worsening summer heatwaves and downpours thousands of miles south in @entity3 and the @entity4 could be linked to a thaw in @entity7 ice			1
the images above show sea ice coverage in 1980 ( right ) and 2012 ( left ) experts in @entity26 and the @entity4 said they could not conclusively say the @entity7 thaw caused more extreme weather , or vice versa			1
however , they said they had found evidence of a relationship between the two			0
rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the @entity7 were changing atmospheric pressure and winds , the report said			1
they claim the changes slowed the eastward movement of vast meandering weather systems and meant more time for extreme weather to develop			1
the report claims changes in the @entity46 could increase erratic weather patterns			2
the @entity48 has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years			1
here , the flooded @entity49 breaks its banks and floods properties in the town of @entity53 these included a heatwave in @entity56 in 2010 , droughts in the @entity4 and @entity26 in 2011 and 2012 , or heavy summer rains that caused floods in @entity48 in 2012			0
the @entity48 has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years , including the @entity60 , which claimed 22 lives , devastating floods at @entity63 in 2004 and @entity64 in 2009 and october 's storms , which killed four			1
the report follows a warning by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) that extreme weather will continue to become more frequent			2
‘ the study contributes to a growing body of evidence that ... the melting @entity7 has wide - ranging implications for people living in the middle latitudes , ’ lead author @entity77 of the @entity78 told @entity72			2
rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the @entity7 were changing atmospheric pressure and winds , the report said sea ice in the @entity7 shrank to a record low in 2012 and the @entity88 's panel of climate scientists says it could almost vanish in summers by 2050 with rising greenhouse gas emissions			1
but some scientists said other factors , including the usual vagaries of weather or changing sea temperatures , may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the @entity7			1
‘ the jury is still very much out , ’ @entity99 , an expert at @entity100 , said of efforts to see if there is a link between a melting @entity7 and extremes further south in the northern hemisphere			2
some evidence in sunday 's study was ‘ plausible ... but far from conclusive , ’ he said , adding that some of the data were not statistically significant and might be random variations			0
parts of central @entity3 have suffered vast floods in the @entity115 and @entity116 basins while parts of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 ( pictured ) have been ravaged by bush fires and heatwaves ‘ for people on the streets , what really matters is whether the extremes are changing or not			0
but from the scientific perspective we want to understand why , ’ he said			0
better understanding is vital to make reliable predictions			0
in september , the @entity88 's panel of climate scientists raised the probability that most global warming since 1950 has a human cause - mostly gases released by burning fossil fuels - to 95 per cent from 90 in a previous assessment in 2007			0
@entity138 , of the @entity4 @entity139 , said many extremes studied were in the past decade , too short to know for sure if they were enhanced by @entity7 ice and snow melt or not			1
‘ sceptics remain unconvinced that @entity7 / mid-latitude linkages are proven , and this work will do little to change their viewpoint , ’ he wrote in a comment in @entity9			0
the costs of extreme weather events have risen dramatically , climate scientists warned last week			1
the national science academies of @entity153 believe @entity3 needs to plan for future probabilities of extreme weather , such as heat waves , floods and storms			2
highlighting a 60 per cent rise over the last 30 years in the cost of damage from extreme weather events across @entity3 , the @entity160 ' @entity159 ( @entity161 ) warned of the grave economic and social consequences if @entity3 policy makers do not use the latest estimates of future droughts , floods and storms in their planning while adapting to global warming and the resulting climate disruption			2
the report urges @entity100 nations to prepare for heat waves and think about how to reduce the number of deaths			0
flood defence is also an area that requires improvement , as rising sea levels will leave coastal areas at serious risk from storm surges			0
researchers also believe climate research and adaptation plans should be given more priority .			0

study says severe weather will affect billions in @entity11 and @entity12
this is because the @entity7 thaw is changing the atmospheric pressure
slower air patterns could allow time for extreme weather to develop
but scientists claim vagaries in changing sea temperatures may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the @entity7 ice
