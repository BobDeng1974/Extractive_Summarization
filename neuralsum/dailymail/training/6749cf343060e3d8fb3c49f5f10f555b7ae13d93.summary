by @entity0 for @entity1 does our sun have any brothers and sisters and , if so , where are they ? that ’s a question that has puzzled astronomers , who think that our sun most likely formed in a molecular cloud along with other stars			1
but now a simulation has predicted that we should be able to find such siblings , because all stars born from the same cloud have a similar chemical ' fingerprint ’			1
scroll down for animations showing the simulation astrophysicists at the @entity20 have simulated star formation			1
they show that stars born of the same cloud have similar ' fingerprints '			1
this information could be used to find stars that were born from the same molecular cloud as our sun ( shown ) - even if they are the other side of the galaxy stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium , but they also contain trace amounts of other elements , such as carbon , oxygen , iron , and even more exotic substances			1
by carefully measuring the wavelengths ( colors ) of light coming from a star , astronomers can determine how abundant each of these trace elements is			0
for any two stars at random , the abundances of their trace elements will slightly differ : one star may have a bit more iron , the other a bit more carbon , and so on			2
however , astronomers have known for more than a decade that any two stars within the same gravitationally bound star cluster always show the same abundances			1
being able to measure this ' fingerprint ' is potentially very useful , because stellar families usually do not stay together			0
most stars are born as members of star cluster , but over time they drift apart and migrate across the galaxy			1
their abundances , however , are set at birth			0
thus , astronomers have long wondered if it might be possible to tell if two stars that are now on opposite sides of the galaxy were born billions of years ago from the same giant molecular cloud			1
and now , according to the latest simulations , it seems like this might be possible			0
the simulation was devised by astrophysicists at the @entity20 , @entity80			1
their results , published in @entity82 , show that stars born from the same cluster will share a chemical fingerprint with each other			1
this can then be used to trace them to the same birthplace			0
‘ we can see that stars that are part of the same star cluster today are chemically identical , ’ said dr @entity90 , professor of astronomy and astrophysics at @entity80			2
‘ but we had no good reason to think that this would also be true of stars that were born together and then dispersed immediately rather than forming a long - lived cluster			2
’ for example it ’s thought that our sun and its siblings probably went their own separate ways within a few million years after they were born			2
but the study suggests that , even if the long - lost siblings are now the other side of the galaxy , they could be found			1
to make the findings @entity112 and @entity80 graduate student @entity111 used supercomputers to simulate two streams of interstellar gas coming together to form a cloud that , over the course of a few million years , collapses under its own gravity to make a cluster of stars			2
this face - on view of the simulation shows interstellar giant molecular cloud gas streams mixing before collapsing to form stars			1
the numbers rapidly increasing at the upper left show the passage of time in millions of years			0
the left panel shows the density of interstellar gas and right panel shows red and blue ' tracer dyes ' the results showed extreme turbulence as the two streams came together , and this turbulence effectively mixed together the tracer dyes			2
' we put red dye in one stream and blue dye in the other , and by the time the cloud started to collapse and form stars , everything was purple , ' said dr @entity90			2
' the resulting stars were purple as well			0
' this explains why stars that are born together wind up having the same abundances : as the cloud that forms them is assembled , it gets thoroughly mixed			1
' this was actually a bit of a surprise			0
i did n't expect the turbulence to be as violent as it was , so i did n't expect the mixing to be as rapid or efficient			0
i thought we 'd get some blue stars and some red stars , instead of getting all purple stars			0
' this edge - on view shows a cross section through the two streams as they meet			0
in both animations the circles outlined in black are stars ; stars are shown as white in the left panel , and in the right panel their color reflects the amount of the two tracer dyes in each star the simulations also showed that the mixing happens very fast , before much of the gas has turned into stars			0
this is encouraging for the prospects of finding the sun 's siblings , because the distinguishing characteristic of stellar families that do n't stay together is that they probably disperse before much of their parent cloud has been converted to stars			2
if the mixing did n't happen quickly enough , then the chemical uniformity of star clusters would be the exception rather than the rule			0
instead , the simulations indicate that even clouds that do n't turn much of their gas into stars produce stars with nearly identical chemical signatures			0
' the idea of finding the siblings of the sun through chemical tagging is not new , but no one had any idea if it would work , " dr @entity90 said			0
' the underlying problem was that we did n't really know why stars in clusters are chemically homogeneous , and so we could n't make any sensible predictions about what would happen in the environment where the sun formed , which must have been quite different from the environments that give rise to long - lived star clusters			1
' this study puts the idea on much firmer footing and will hopefully spur greater efforts toward making use of this technique			0
' in the simulation the researchers found that chemicals in interstellar clouds , represented by a purple trace dye ( shown ) , mixed more than thought in the turbulent event			1
the research could ultimately lead to find brothers and sisters of our sun elsewhere in the @entity240			1
