the @entity0 at men - only @entity2 in 2013 was perhaps the most bruising week in the history of the @entity4			2
' never again ' became the mantra after the event was overshadowed by political and media condemnation of the club 's exclusionary membership policy			1
accordingly , the @entity10 put their own house in order , sweeping away more than 250 years of tradition with a vote last year that will see the club accept its first women members			0
that intent to avoid another @entity2 surely lies behind tuesday 's announcement that men - only @entity20 , who will host next year 's @entity0 , are undertaking a ' comprehensive ' review of their membership policy			1
they also agreed to share responsibility for hosting the event with @entity26			0
@entity20 will undertake a ' comprehensive review ' of its male only membership policy of the three men - only clubs on the @entity0 rota — royal @entity33 's in @entity35 is the other — @entity37 had been the most aloof following the @entity10 vote			1
they hid behind the line that members of a separate club , @entity43 , can play the @entity0 layout			2
' we are a single - gender club but feel it is unfair to be compared to some other clubs , ' said secretary @entity49			0
then @entity51 girls champion and @entity20 ladies member @entity52 revealed she was not even allowed to use the practice putting green			0
imagine that being regurgitated during @entity0 ? hence the @entity20 press release announcing the review			2
@entity2 and @entity57 's are not due to host again until the 2020s but both are also undertaking reviews			0
@entity62 @entity61 won his only major championship when @entity20 last hosted @entity0 in 2004 the club shares its facilities with the ladies ' golf club , @entity37 , and are set to play joint hosts for @entity0			1

@entity20 will undertake a review of its membership policy
the club 's exclusively male membership has come under *scrutiny*
@entity37 are due to host @entity0 in 2016
