by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 04:13 est , 6 september 2012 many keep it as a precious memento of the best day of their lives			2
some hold on to it to pass on to a daughter or niece			2
others even wear it to renew their vows			2
@entity14 ’s wedding dress , on the other hand , ended up on the tip. the wife of the former deputy prime minister revealed that she was forced to dump the treasured gown after her husband grew tired of lugging it around during house moves			1
scroll down to watch the hilarious highlights ! confessions : former deputy prime minister @entity14 and his wife @entity24 gave a glimpse into their marital life in an appearance on @entity29 mr and mrs and although it is almost five decades since the dress became landfill , it seems a touch of resentment remains , with @entity36 , 73 , saying : ‘ @entity37 has never kept his wedding suit			1
i wish he had so i could throw it on the tip. ’ the couple made the confession – and a few others – to television presenter @entity44 when they appeared on his show @entity29 last night			2
lord @entity14 said he regretted disposing of the dress and had not realised its value at the time			1
the 74 - year - old explained : ‘ when we got married she bought a wedding dress but she never told me how much it cost			1
at the time she told me she would turn it into a cocktail dress but she never did			2
‘ we also had this big box and we used to carry it from house to house			2
one day i said let ’s get rid of it			2
she was pregnant at the time			0
so we went down to the corporation tip and we dumped it			1
‘ she never told me how much the wedding dress was but she has been going to those boutiques for years ’			1
' mystery and surprise ' : lord @entity14 , left , and his wife , right , each donned headphones during parts of the show so they could n't hear what the other was saying the couple also admitted that another source of conflict between them is the kitchen			1
lord @entity14 said : ‘ @entity24 wishes i had two offices so i would not use her kitchen as an office			1
she always complains about that			0
‘ there was a time when @entity87 rang up and she was banging the pots and pans in the kitchen and i said “ listen love , can you shut up , i am talking to @entity87 ” and she said “ this is my kitchen , not your office			0
and who is @entity87 ? ” ‘ @entity87 then came on the phone and said : “ i heard that			0
” ‘ i was trying to get @entity87 and @entity100 to agree and there she was banging the plates			0
it was a crucial moment			0
she deliberately goes around banging plates so you ca n’t hear the phone			0
’ however , while the couple were quick to confess their more amusing marital conflicts in front of a studio audience on the @entity116 show , there was one bump in the road that did not get a mention			0
in 2006 , it emerged that @entity14 had carried out an affair with his glamorous secretary @entity122 , a divorcee 24 years his junior			1
the two - year fling began at an office @entity125 in 2002 after months of flirtation			0
the pair continued secret trysts at the politician ’s grace - and - favour flat in @entity131 and at @entity132 , his 215 - acre country retreat in @entity134 , until 2004			0
last year , @entity14 said : ‘ it was stupid			1
i ’ve got no excuse really			0
people talk about mid-life crisis but i think it was part of an opportunity that developed			0
’ though they have stayed together , in an interview last year @entity36 admitted she would never forgive her husband			1
the couple married in @entity145 in 1961 when @entity14 , 23 , was a ship steward , and 22 - year - old @entity36 worked as a hairdresser			1
on last night ’s programme , the @entity149 stalwart paid tribute to his wife , saying : ‘ i could not have been successful without her			1
she always pinches the tv remote off me though			0
it ’s 50 years and there is still mystery and surprise so long may that continue			1
’ in the show , one half of the couple is asked questions about their partner , while the other is taken to a separate booth , blindfolded and fitted with headphones to stop them hearing the answers			0
when they return , they are asked the same questions – and have to give the same answer to score points and win money for charity .			0
