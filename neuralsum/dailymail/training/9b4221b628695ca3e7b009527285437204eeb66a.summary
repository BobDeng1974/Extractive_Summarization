carrying a guitar can increase the chances of you getting a date by a third , according to a study by researchers from the @entity7			1
the study found that women were 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar - double the amount of people who would give their number to the same man when he was empty - handed			1
but this technique only works if your a man , women are not seen any more or less attractive if they carry a musical instrument			2
according to a study by @entity26 researchers in @entity27 , men who carry guitars are seen as more attractive than sporty - looking men			1
carrying an instrument can boost your chances of getting a date by 31 % researchers @entity32 from the @entity33 , and @entity34 filmed 40 psychology students - half men and half women - explaining which two items they 'd take to a desert island and why , choosing from chocolate , hairspray or a plastic bag			1
even though they had n't been told about humour , 19 of the 40 students tried to be funny in their responses			0
the next 11 students were played audio recordings of these 19 participants and asked to rate them for funniness , and for the attractiveness			0
the magazine revealed that ' a key result is that attractive actors were judged to be funnier			0
' it added ' men who were considered funnier also tended to be considered more attractive for both short and long term relationships but especially short term			0
' the study was led by professor @entity59 , a researcher in behavioural sciences at the @entity7			0
@entity59 hired a 20 - year - old man to approach 300 women aged between 18 and 22 in a shopping centre in @entity27			1
the man told each girl that they were ' really pretty ' and asked for her phone number so they could arrange a date			2
for the first 100 women he was holding a sports bag			0
for the next 100 women he approached them holding a guitar case			2
and for the final 100 women , the man asked them for their number without anything in his hands			1
when the actor was carrying the guitar case , 31 % of the women gave them his number			1
when he was carrying nothing , 14 % of the women gave them his number			1
the biggest turn off for the women was when he was carrying the sports bag , which had a success rate of only 9 %			1
according to research from the @entity7 , women are 31 % likely to give a man their phone number when he 's carrying a guitar			1
the biggest turn off for women is men carrying sports bags @entity101 singer and musician @entity100 topped the list of the 20 sexiest male musicians of all time , according to @entity106			1
the 66 - year - old has been married twice			0
his current wife is @entity111 fashion model @entity109 according to @entity115 , the top ten songs which all budding musicians must learn if they want to impress a woman are : 1			0
just like @entity121 - @entity120 5			0
wonderful tonight - @entity123 7			0
@entity132 , i â€™m @entity130 - @entity133 @entity59 's findings mirror those from a study carried out by the @entity137 and @entity138 last year			2
in the @entity141 study , 100 single women were sent @entity143 friend requests with a message that said : ' i like your photo '			2
half of the respondents were sent a request by a man seen strumming a guitar in his profile picture			2
the other half were sent a request from the same person , but this time he was empty handed			0
only five ( 10 % ) of the 50 women accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the empty - handed man			1
yet 28 % accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the man holding a guitar			1
the @entity26 researchers attribute these findings to the fact that playing a musical instrument is a sign that the man is intelligent , can learn , or is willing to learn , new skills and has independent hobbies			1
they believe there may also be a link between how musicans are portrayed in the media , and that holding a guitar is a sign of wealth and status			0
the team from the @entity7 also wanted to test whether the same theory was true when it came to female musicians			0
@entity59 's team repeated the @entity141 study , but used females to send the friend requests			0
he found there was no difference in the response rate of the men she sent requests to whether she was holding a guitar or not			2
this suggests that its only women who consider playing an instrument to be an attractive trait .			0

women are 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar
sporty - looking men were the least *popular* during the @entity26 study getting numbers in only 9 % of cases
