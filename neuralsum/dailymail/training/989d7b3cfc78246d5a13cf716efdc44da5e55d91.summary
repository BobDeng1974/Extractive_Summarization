the 46 - year - old , who worked for the @entity15 care home chain as business administration manager , called police after witnessing a catalogue of errors being covered up or ignored by senior staff			1
her actions led to the £ 3,000 - a - month home being shut down in 2011			1
as a consequence miss @entity1 was made redundant from her £ 36,000 - a - year job			1
and the mother of two says her decision to go to the authorities has left her feeling ‘ victimised ’			2
she said : ‘ i have applied for well over 100 jobs in the last two years , mainly in care , and i ’m still out of work			2
people just do n’t want to know			0
‘ i feel like i ’ve just been branded as a troublemaker and no one is willing to hire me , even though i have done nothing wrong			1
all i have done is told the truth			0
’ an inquest heard how residents at @entity3 , in @entity39 , @entity40 , were routinely given overdoses and were left soiled and in pain during two years of mismanagement and staff shortages			2

another 14 residents died of natural causes after suffering ‘ sub-optimal ’ care			2

miss @entity1 , from @entity59 , @entity60 , says she was asked to shred mrs @entity49 ’s medical records and new ones were falsified			1
@entity1 gave evidence at the inquest but was made redundant as a consequence she said : ‘ i was n’t completely sure what it was i was shredding and with no medical training i felt i was n’t in a position to question my manager but alarm bells were starting to ring			1
’ miss @entity1 said she became increasingly concerned about the welfare of residents after finding one elderly patient on a mattress eating his breakfast ‘ out of a bowl like a dog ’			1
she said : ‘ there were things that were worrying me , bell cords were tied up and out of reach and residents were not being fed properly			0
‘ i felt a sense of responsibility and i did n’t know what to do or who to tell			0
’ miss @entity1 said the stress caused her to lose three stone in weight			2
she also separated from her partner of 15 years			0
@entity93 , in @entity39 , @entity40 was shut down after an inquest found it was ' riddled with institutional abuse ' a coroner ruled neglect and abuse contributed to the deaths of @entity50 and @entity52 among others she now relies on her children – @entity101 , a golfer , and @entity103 , 26 , a chartered accountant – to help her pay the bills while her father , a retired businessman , pays the mortgage on her semi-detached home			1
she said : ‘ it has been a nightmare and i can see why people are reluctant to whistleblow , but i ’m glad i made that call			0
‘ if i had left it any longer we could be looking at another 19 deaths and no one wants that			0

i should n’t be made to feel like a victim			0
