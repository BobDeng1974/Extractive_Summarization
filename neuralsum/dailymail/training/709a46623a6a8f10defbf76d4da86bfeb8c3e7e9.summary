by @entity0 practically anything - from gadgets to shoes - can be made waterproof using a special coating , but this coating eventually wears off leaving items at risk from water damage			1
now engineers have created a way to not only make such objects permanently waterproof , but make the material so resistant to liquid it causes water to physically bounce off			1
by adding tiny structures to the surfaces of everyday items , the researchers claim they have created the ' most extreme form of waterproof ' - and it could one day be used to protect boats and planes			1
existing waterproofing involves spraying surfaces with a coating , but by adding tiny structures to the surface instead , droplets bounce , pictured , rather than roll off the super-hydrophobic surfaces the researchers are testing in the lab fall into one of two categories : surfaces with micro posts , or surfaces with ribs and cavities one tenth the size of a human hair			1
to create these micro-structured surfaces , the professors use a process similar to photo film development that etches patterns onto cd - sized wafers			2
the researchers then add a thin water - resistant film to the surfaces , such as @entity50 , and use ultra-high - speed cameras to document the way water interacts when dropped , jetted or boiled on them			1
the researchers said that slight alterations in the width of the ribs and cavities , or the angles of the rib walls can significantly change the water responses			1
' people know about these surfaces , but why they cause droplets or jets to behave the way they do is not particularly well known , ’ professor @entity62 said			2
‘ if you do n’t know why the phenomena are occurring , it may or may not actually be beneficial to you			0
’ the technique was devised by @entity72 's mechanical engineering professor @entity71 along with colleague professor @entity73 based in @entity24			1
‘ to create a superhydrophobic surface , you ca n’t just do that with a coating like @entity50 or wax , you have to actually put a structure on it , ’ explained professor @entity62			2
‘ in nature , lotus leaves do this really well , so what we do in the lab is similar to what we observe on the lotus leaf – we have these structures , and we have water sitting on top of them			2
' professor @entity92 continued that superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a multitude of different ways			0
in her lab , the team used rib and cavity structures , as well as posts that the water sits on top of , like a ball			1
as the water droplet falls on to professor @entity92 ’s superhydrophobic surface , it spreads out like a traditional drop on a surface			0
but , unlike typical droplets , the structure causes it to come back together again until it lifts off the surface completely			0
professor @entity62 explained that water molecules are more attracted to themselves than the surface she has created , meaning they pull together before rolling straight off the surface			2
@entity72 superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a multitude of different ways			0
in the @entity72 lab , the team used rib and cavity structures , pictured left , or ones made of tiny posts , pictured right , that the water sits on top of like a ball as water droplets fall on to superhydrophobic surfaces , pictured , they spread out like a traditional drop would			1
but , unlike typical droplets , the structures built into the surface causes the water to come back together again until it forms a ball and lifts off the surface completely ‘ traditional waterproof products use a spray coating to protect the surface , at @entity72 we have developed a way of creating superhydrophobic surfaces so we are n’t just looking at droplets on surfaces , we ’re looking at flow through surfaces , ’ she continued			1
the surfaces could be applied to solar panels that do n’t get dirty or can self - clean when water rolls off of them , or showers , tubs or toilets that prevent water spots forming			1
@entity92 also said it could be used on bio-medical devices , such as the interior of tubes or syringes that deliver fluids to patients , hulls of ships , exterior of torpedoes or submarines and airplane wings that will resist wingtip icing in cold or humid conditions			0
the researchers ' process was inspired by the way lotus leaves , pictured , repel rain drops			0
the surfaces could be applied to solar panels that do n't get dirty or can self - clean when water rolls off of them , or showers , tubs or toilets that prevent water spots forming many existing treatments used to make objects waterproof involve spraying them with a hydrophobic coating such as @entity50 , or a wax			1
this image shows how a droplet sits on top of a hydrophobic , rather than a superhydrophobic surface looking further ahead , @entity62 and @entity73 ’ research could be used to create cleaner and more efficient energy			0
‘ nearly every power plant across the country creates energy by burning coal or natural gas to create steam that expands and rotates a turbine			0
' once that has happened , the steam needs to be condensed back into a liquid state to be cycled back through , ’ explained the researchers			0
‘ if power plant condensers can be built with optimal super-hydrophobic surfaces , that process can be sped up in significant ways , saving time and lowering costs to generate power			2
‘ if you have these surfaces , the fluid is n’t attracted to the condenser wall , and as soon as the steam starts condensing to a liquid , it just rolls right off			0
and so you can very , very quickly and efficiently condense a lot of gas			0
’ the findings are published in journal @entity219 .			0

researchers have created a technique to make surfaces super waterproof
existing waterproofing involves spraying surfaces with a coating
but , by adding structures to a surface instead , droplets bounce off
this is because water sits on the structures , not the surface of the material
structures built in @entity24 *include* ribs and cavities , or rows of posts
process could be used to make solar panels , ships and planes waterproof
