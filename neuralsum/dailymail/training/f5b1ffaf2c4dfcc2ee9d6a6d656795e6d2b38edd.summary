@entity7 defied medics after she was seriously injured on @entity9 when a container of fire lighting fluid exploded at her home in @entity13 during a barbeque			1
she suffered 80 per cent burns to her body and doctors feared she may not have survived			0
the toddler has been in hospital since @entity9 and earlier this month underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from @entity23 to be grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs			1
recovering : @entity30 sits up in her hospital bed with moth @entity32 after undergoing a skin graft to repair 80 per cent burns to her body doctors have now said that the artificial skin grafts have ' taken well ' to her body			1
according to @entity37 , the operation to graft the skin onto @entity30 's body went well			1
he said that , while there would be scarring , it should be much less than if normal skin grafts had been carried out			0
so far , he added , @entity30 's new skin grafts seem to be taking and the youngster has slowly been woken up from the medically induced coma that she was kept in			1
now that she is awake and doing well , doctors are hopeful that @entity30 will be able to return home soon			2
@entity30 underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of ' cloned ' skin , which was flown in from @entity23 , grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs			1
close : @entity30 is recovering well after the groundbreaking skin graft to the 80 per cent burns on her body , doctors said tender : @entity32 kisses her daughter , who has been in hospital since the accident on @entity9 as part of a highly experimental therapy , the skin was grown in a laboratory in @entity72 , @entity73 using cells harvested from @entity30 's body			1
the skin , which has to kept at a temperature of 2 ° c to 8 ° c , only has a 24 - hour shelf life and the flight from @entity23 to @entity3 took 21 hours			1
it was then whisked through customs and arrived at the hospital just 16 minutes after the plane had touched down			0
' everything went quite smoothly , ' said dr @entity37 , a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who performed the surgery on @entity30 in a @entity13 hospital			1
dr @entity88 said he did not hold out much hope for the toddler 's survival when he first met her in january			0
treatment : the toddler was treated with 41 pieces of skin flown in from @entity23 to be grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs brave : @entity30 has taken well to the skin graft , which was done using skin grown in a laboratory in @entity72 with her body cells ' she had swelled to three times her size from her injuries , ' he said			1
@entity30 has been in hospital since being admitted in january and during that time has battled pneumonia and kidney failure , as well as suffering several cardiac arrests			2
doctors finally stabilised her so that this week 's complex skin transplant surgery could be carried out			2
dr @entity88 and his team used enough skin during the surgery to cover a mat and stapled it in pieces onto @entity30 's wounds			1
on her face , doctors used absorbent stitch material instead of staples			2
the new skin had been created by cloning two samples of skin taken from one of the few parts of @entity30 's body that escaped injury thanks to a diaper she was wearing at the time of the accident			1
groundbreaking : dr @entity37 ( pictured left ) and @entity136 push three - year - old @entity7 into surgery under the knife : anaesthetist @entity139 ( pictured left ) checks @entity30 during her pioneering surgery the samples were sent to @entity143 laboratory in @entity72 where the skin was ' cloned ' using mouse cells as a ' scaffold '			1
the procedure has been used many times in @entity23 and @entity149 , but rarely in @entity3 , dr @entity88 said			1
on monday evening , a special courier arrived from @entity72 with a stainless steel container carrying about 30 to 40 grafts of @entity30 's new skin			2
thin , delicate and almost transparent , the skin was taken to a @entity13 hospital by ambulance from the airport			2
the skin needed to be grafted onto @entity30 within 24 hours of leaving the laboratory			1
' it was like clockwork the way the skin arrived on time , ' said dr @entity88			0
anxious : @entity165 suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body after an accident at a barbeque at her home in @entity13 , @entity3 hoping for a quick recovery : @entity30 's parents @entity172 and @entity32 shown with son @entity174 as @entity30 was wheeled out of the surgery , her father @entity175 expressed his relief to reporters			1
' everything looks great - it 's fantastic , ' he said			0
the little girl 's mother , @entity136 , who has been by her daughter 's bedside since the accident , looked equally relieved			0
for a week after the operation , @entity30 will be wrapped in foam and protective dressing			2
she faces two immediate challenges			0
the first is ensuring that she remains free of infection			0
the second challenge is to prevent the new skin from sliding off and not taking			0
skin grafts are delicate and prone to tearing			0
doctors will have to keep @entity7 sedated to minimise the risk of tearing			2
@entity197 , founder of the @entity198 , a local charity dedicated to providing medical treatments for young burn survivors , considers @entity30 to be one of the luckier burn victims			0
she said survival in @entity3 often depends on victims ' proximity to a hospital and whether they are properly equipped			0
while there are no reliable statistics , ms @entity197 estimates that around 15,000 children are seriously injured every year			0
in impoverished areas , the use of candles , paraffin stoves and open fires are often the causes of fire , particularly during the winter months			0
@entity219 , in the @entity218 province of @entity3 , currently has 12 children in their burns unit			0
in the case of @entity30 , access to medical care at an early stage as well as her parent 's ability to raise money through social networking sites have all helped ease the burden			0
dr @entity88 will be able to tell whether the skin has successfully taken after two weeks but he is optimistic given @entity7 's determination			2
' she is a fighter , ' he said .			0

doctors did not expect little @entity7 ' @entity30 ' @entity175 to survive after the *horrific* accident at a family barbecue in @entity13 , @entity3
she underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from @entity23 and grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs
