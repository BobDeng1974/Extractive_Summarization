by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 11:01 est , 4 december 2012 the christmas tree lights ' switch on ' was billed as a major event for the people of @entity5 who turned out in their droves to watch @entity8 's @entity7 flick the switch			1
the sight of safety barriers and security guards protecting the 8ft tree - the crown jewel in the @entity16 town 's @entity18 festival - served only to heighten the excitement			1
but within an hour of lighting up the town and the faces of the 1,500 who turned out , the fake - frosted tree was hurriedly taken down for fear of electrocuting somebody			1
fir your eyes ( and one hour ) only : the @entity28 in all its glory before council bosses pulled the plug after one hour for fear of electrocuting somebody fake fir : the £ 10,000 metal christmas tree took all day to put up and was the crown jewel in @entity37 's £ 15,000 @entity18 budget			1
more than 1,500 people turned out to see the big switch on shocking : one @entity16 councillor said that there was a good risk that anyone messing around with it would ' not just get a little shock			0
it would be a fatality ' the plug was pulled when @entity37 chiefs realised the 240 volt metal tree twinkling with thousands of blue lights was ten times the health and safety electrics limit			1
@entity16 councillor @entity53 , who helped organise the festival , said : ' the tree was metal and covered in leds			1
' if anyone was to open up a junction box or was messing about with it then there was good risk that they would not just get a little shock			0
' it would be a fatality			0
' i am disappointed because it was a great spectacle for @entity5 ’s @entity69			0
it is a total joke			0
' the tree was bought six weeks before saturday 's ' switch - on ' and its instructions were in @entity74 , although this is not believed to have caused the oversight			1
it was erected by @entity78 , who checked the tree and realised it did not meet safety specifications so fenced it off for the duration of the event and then had it dismantled			2
council clerk @entity86 said : ' modification work has been scheduled for january / february 2013 to ensure that the tree is fully operational in less controlled circumstances for many more @entity90 to come and a range of suitable locations is being considered within the council ’s wider regeneration strategy for the town centre			2
' local shop owners , who hoped the town ’s new decoration would bring much - needed trade to the town , told of their shock over the tree ’s premature removal			2
@entity104 , manager of @entity105 , a clothes and home ware store on @entity69 said : ' it was meant to be a big event			0
@entity18 always goes so quickly : the assembling and dismantling of the 8ft metal tree cost £ 2,000			1
the voltage needed to light it ran at 240v - ten times the safety limit on the button : @entity117 ( centre ) alongside @entity119 and an unknown volunteer lighting up the £ 10,000 metal christmas tree ' the town council and @entity123 wrote to us asking us to extend our opening hours which we did			1
' there was a lot spent on it and we all hoped it would attract more people here			0
' it ’s disappointing that the tree has been taken down , they went to a lot of effort on the night getting a soap star and they were collecting money from each store for a @entity138 for the kids			2
” @entity140 , owner of @entity142 ’s hairdressing on @entity69 , @entity5 , said : ' i saw them putting it up on saturday , after four hours they ’d half finished it , but i left before they finished or took it down			0
' it was a fake frosted metal tree			1
ready for action : @entity8 's @entity117 , known as @entity152 to soap fans , turned on @entity5 's @entity18 lights ' i ’m not really surprised			1
i did n’t think it would last , some people in @entity5 might have vandalised it first			0
' i think that £ 10,000 could have been better spent , there ’s a few shops fronts that need doing up			0
' the town has another christmas tree already just further down the road , so it seems like a waste			2
@entity165 , assistant manager of @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity5 , said : ' i saw it being put up , it was 8ft and white with white lights and they switched the lights on			0
they spent all afternoon putting it up			0
' they should have thought it through			0
' the tree formed part of a programme of activities paid for by the town council and delivered by the non-profit organisation @entity182			2
@entity183 , head of technical services at @entity78 , said : ' the tree purchased by @entity37 was not safe for use in an unsupervised outdoor public display			1
' safety requirements specify a maximum voltage for such electrical equipm of 24 volts			2
' in this case the tree had electrics which ran at 240 volts - 10 times the safe level			1
' the tree , which was part of a wider festive lighting display , was therefore fenced off and supervised during the switch - on event and taken down following the event on saturday , at the request of the town council			0

metal tree had electrics running at 240 volts ( ten times the safe level )
instructions for tree 's assembly were in @entity74
the tree wo *n't* be going back up in time for this @entity18
