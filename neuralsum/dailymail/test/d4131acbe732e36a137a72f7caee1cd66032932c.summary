at first glance , the rest of our solar system seems to be a pretty barren place - pockmarked worlds with dry surfaces are abundant , and only one - @entity6 - has visible water			1
but by peering beneath the surfaces of other worlds , scientists are quickly realising that water may actually be much more commonplace than thought			2
nine other worlds in total are now suspected to have some form of subsurface ocean containing far more water than is on @entity6 - and some may even contain life , according to @entity19			1
@entity19 has released an infographic explaining which worlds in the solar system are thought to have oceans under their surface , such as @entity25 , seen here			1
the distance from the sun is given in @entity28 , which stands for @entity28 - and one @entity28 is the distance from @entity6 to the sun the agency released an infographic detailing the various worlds of our solar system suspected to have subsurface oceans			1
it followed claims by dr @entity38 , chief scientist for the agency , that we could find life in the next ten or 20 years			0
‘ @entity19 science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds , and life , in the universe , ’ she said			1
‘ in our lifetime , we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond			1
’ there at least 200 billion @entity6 - like planets in our galaxy - and now @entity19 officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them			1
during a talk in @entity63 this week , the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			0
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity6 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said dr @entity38 , chief scientist for @entity19			2
' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology			0
' dr @entity74 , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when			0
' ' we are not talking about little green men , ' dr @entity38 said			0
' we are talking about little microbes			0
' water is important because life , as we know it , needs it to survive			2
some may say that there could be other forms of life that do n’t need water - but as we do n’t know of any yet , it makes sense to look for wet environments to discover if we are alone or not			2
‘ as @entity19 missions explore our solar system and search for new worlds , they are finding water in surprising places , ’ the agency said in a statement			1
‘ @entity81 is but one piece of our search for habitable planets and life beyond @entity6 , yet it links many seemingly unrelated worlds in surprising ways			2
’ the chemical elements in water , hydrogen and oxygen , are some of the most abundant elements in the universe			0
the signature of water can be seen in the giant molecular clouds between stars , or in disks of material in young planetary systems			0
in our solar system the gas giant planets - @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 - are thought to contains lots of water in their atmospheres			1
but it is the solid moons and dwarf planets that are of more interest			1
for example , scientists using @entity19 ’s @entity130 recently provided powerful evidence that @entity118 ’s moon @entity133 has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice			1
signs of an underground ocean on @entity141 can be seen in the lines that are strewn across its surface			0
a nasa mission next decade will seek to search for water emanating from @entity141 - and see if its oceans are habitable			2
@entity133 , meanwhile , has layers of water and ice below its surface scientists using @entity19 ’s @entity130 recently provided powerful evidence that @entity118 ’s moon @entity133 has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice			1
the water forms because the moon is pushed and pulled by the gas giant @entity118 here the lines across @entity141 's surface can be seen , likely caused by the icy surface cracking due to the motion of water underground on its surface , @entity162 is a barren world covered in craters , but underground it might also have an underground ocean			2
meanwhile , geysers of water have been seen shooting from @entity170 water on worlds like @entity133 forms through tidal heating ; its orbit around @entity118 is not perfectly circular , so it is pushed and pulled by the planet ’s gravity , melting ice beneath its surface			2
@entity119 ’s moons @entity141 and @entity170 are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface , in contact with mineral - rich rock , and may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it			1
these are liquid water , essential chemical elements for biological processes and sources of energy that could be used by living things			0
@entity19 's @entity196 mission has also revealed @entity170 as an active world of icy geysers			0
recent research suggests it may have hydrothermal activity on its ocean floor , an environment potentially suitable for living organisms			0
signs of water have also been spotted in craters on @entity207 , while it appears that @entity209 was at least once wet - and may still have occasional brief rivers of water on its surface			0
the dwarf planet @entity25 , between @entity6 and @entity118 , may also have some water - ice on its surface - and water underground			1
@entity19 ’s @entity216 , which recently arrived in orbit , will hopefully reveal how wet this world is			0
@entity219 could have lakes of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface , but may also have an ocean of water underground - although its unlikely to support life			2
@entity226 , meanwhile , often compared to the @entity227 from @entity228 owing to its huge crater , could possibly harbor life jets of material are seen shooting from @entity170 here , as pictured by @entity19 's @entity196 spacecraft			0
exactly how these jets form or what they are made of , however , is not clear @entity19 recently announced that it is now thought @entity209 once had more water than the @entity239 on @entity6 , shown in this illustration			2
almost of this water has gone today , leaving the world barren and dry towards the outer reaches of the solar system , even @entity245 and the dwarf planet @entity247 may have some sort of ocean hiding under their surfaces other moons including @entity162 , @entity219 , @entity226 and @entity253 are also thought to have underground oceans , while @entity247 at the edge of the solar system may , too , be equally wet			1
and if these worlds are proven to have water , it stands to reason that others outside the solar system may also have oceans , either underground or on their surface			1
missions like the upcoming @entity269 ( @entity269 ) - scheduled to launch in 2017 - will such nearby , bright stars for @entity6 - sized worlds , some of which may have water			0
and @entity19 ’s next great space observatory meanwhile , the @entity271 , scheduled to launch in 2019 , will examine the atmospheres of certain worlds in detail			0
‘ it 's easy to forget that the story of @entity6 's water , from gentle rains to raging rivers , is intimately connected to the larger story of our solar system and beyond , ’ @entity19 said in a statement			1
‘ but our water came from somewhere - every world in our solar system got its water from the same shared source			1
‘ so it 's worth considering that the next glass of water you drink could easily have been part of a comet , or an ocean moon , or a long - vanished sea on the surface of @entity209			0
‘ and note that the night sky may be full of exoplanets formed by similar processes to our home world , where gentle waves wash against the shores of alien seas			0

@entity19 scientists in @entity306 say our solar system is full of water
moons of @entity118 and @entity119 are thought to have oceans underground
dwarf planets like @entity25 and @entity247 may also have similar reservoirs
water is important for the search for life - as life as we know it needs it
