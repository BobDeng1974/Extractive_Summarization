cllr @entity1 and wife @entity10 , both 59 , initially denied the charges against them but changed their plea at the start of their trial last month			1
the pair admitted giving @entity18 a false address in a bid to cash in on extra benefits			1
@entity22 had claimed he lived in a house in @entity24 , @entity2 , when in fact he shared a property in @entity27 with his then - girlfriend , now wife			1
@entity30 @entity29 had heard the dishonesty stretched for more than two years between june 2008 and november 2010			0
the false representation allowed the couple to falsely claim around £ 11,565 in income support , £ 2,346 in council tax and £ 10,949 in housing benefit			1
returning to court for a sentencing hearing today , @entity37 and his wife were told they would not face a custodial sentence			1
instead , they were each handed a 12 - month community order by judge @entity46			2

but he was suspended from @entity6 after being charged by @entity2 police in connection with the fraud			2

' it is quite clear that this is a man that does not have the qualities to be a councillor and should not be one			0
' this was not a mistake or misunderstanding , he admitted making a representation he knew to be false			0
' it sets a poor example and damages the reputation of councillors as a whole			0
' council protocol means @entity37 's sentence is not serious enough to debar him from staying on			2

on a visit to a fire station , he said : ' yes , my cousin married @entity104 and now all their little children are ever so cute and they have slanty eyes			0
