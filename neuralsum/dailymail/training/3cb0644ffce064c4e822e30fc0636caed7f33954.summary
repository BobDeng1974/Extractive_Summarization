it is one of the most celebrated racing games of all time			0
however , some were left slightly disappointed when @entity5 was announced for the @entity6			0
with @entity11 's latest console , the @entity9 , boasting superior specifications , many saw @entity5 as a perfect launch title to show off the new hardware			0
instead , @entity14 have done the reverse - aiming to not only provide the best visuals on the @entity6 , but to show that the aging console still has a long life ahead of it			2
legendary : the @entity21 hill climb will feature in @entity5 6 @entity22 or fake ? one of the famous corners at the @entity21 race course can you tell the difference ? crowds cheer on each side of the track @entity5 features 71 layouts of 33 tracks , 1200 vehicles and - although primarily the same engine as @entity34 , adaptive tessellation is used to give the cars a next - gen sheen			1
earlier this month , it was announced that the @entity21 hill climb course will feature in the game			1
the 1.16 mile of road that runs through the @entity45 's family home 's grounds is legendary in the racing ranks - with a wide variety of vehicles climbing the hill infront of up to 185,000 spectators			2
below are images from the latest @entity21 - three are in - game , three are real - life			1
but will you be able to tell the difference ? iconic : but is this the real @entity21 or is it rendered using the in - game graphics engine ? straight back at you : a part of the course where you can build some speed up legendary : more than 180,000 spectators converge at the @entity21 every year too hard to tell : is this a real photograph or a screenshot taken from the latest @entity5 game ? @entity5 is slated for release on november 28			1
