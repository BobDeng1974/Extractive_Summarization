@entity1 and @entity2 were both 20 stone , @entity0 is now a svelte 8st 8 @entity4 is also planning on undergoing the gastric band operation @entity0 feels like a new woman at a slim size 8 by @entity8 published : 04:17 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 6 august 2012 @entity1 and @entity9 are identical twins - but you would have no idea by looking at these photos of the pair			1
@entity0 , 40 , shed half her body weight after gastric bypass surgery - and now she 's half the size of 20 - stone sister @entity4			1
the cleaner , from @entity19 , @entity20 , once weighed 20 stone like her sister but has now dropped a staggering 11 stone , leaving her weighing just 8.8 stone			1
@entity1 and @entity9 are identical twins - but you would have no idea by looking at this photo of the pair @entity0 , who has dropped from size 30 to a svelte size eight had her operation paid for on the @entity32 because she has polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity34 ) , which can make losing weight naturally difficult			1
and now envious @entity4 wants one too - but has to wait for the green light from @entity32			1
@entity0 said : ' we joke that we 're not identical anymore , but while it 's great for me , i think @entity4 finds it hard			1
' i feel like half the woman i was and my husband jokes that he 's got a new wife			2
the twins both once weighed 20 stone but since her operation , @entity0 is half the size of her sister @entity1 before her gastric bypass surgery with her brother , sister and identical twin @entity9 at age 33 ' there has been times when jealousy has set in			1
@entity4 has accused me of rubbing her face in how good i look now , but i 'm just happy			1
' before , if we were ever teased about our weight , at least we could console each other			0
now she says she no longer feels like a twin			2
' in the past if she ever lost weight i did feel envious - so i know how she is feeling			0
' two years ago @entity0 had the op after fertility experts warned her and husband @entity63 , 45 , she would have to lose weight to conceive			1
over 12 months @entity0 shed half her weight and gave all her old clothes to @entity4			1
@entity0 gave all her old clothes to @entity4 who is hoping to lose the same amount of weight as her twin sister the twins were once bullied at school for their weight and would gorge on kebabs and crisps @entity4 also wants to have the operation but has to lose another stone before she can be considered although @entity4 is jealous of her sister 's remarkable weight loss , she is proud of her and says she deserves it shop assistant , @entity4 , mother of @entity81 , 18 and @entity82 , 22 , also suffers from @entity34 and arthritic joints related to her weight			1
however , doctors say she needs to lose a stone before she can be considered for the surgery			2
@entity0 said : ' when we were younger we were simply known as @entity89			2
people used to say to us , " which one are you ? ' "			0
the pair were dressed the same by their mother and they were truly inseparable			0
' we were bullied at school and called " the fat twins " but we always stood up for each other when the other was getting picked on			0
' we used to stock up on sweets , crisps and fizzy drinks each day before school because our mum would n't let us eat them at home			0
in larger times : @entity1 before her gastric bypass surgery with her husband at age 21 , she has lost a huge amount of weight since look at me now ! @entity1 tries on her old clothes after having lost 11 stone from a gastric bypass ' after leaving home i continued to eat a lot of the wrong things like crisps , pasties and kebabs			1
' over the years we 've tried diets and weight loss classes but the weight has always come back			0
' @entity0 was already a size 18 and weighed 14 stone when she met her husband , aged 20 , but over the years her weight crept up due to crisp binges and weekly @entity132 takeaways and kebabs			1
she said : ' i always considered myself pretty and i had a big personality - but i did n't want people to look at me and say nice face , shame about the body			0
' now i 'm half the person i was and so much healthier			0
even friends of the family i have n't seen for a long time have n't recognised me			0
' i was always a skinny person in a fat persons body			0
i know that @entity4 is too and i hope we can be identical again in the future			2
' size 26 @entity4 , who is engaged to bar worker @entity146 , 27 , says she has suffered with @entity34 for the last five years , during which her weight has fluctuated wildly			1
she said : ' i went from 26 stone to 20 stone then up to nearly 23 stone			1
now i 'm 19.5 stone and working hard to lose enough to get the go ahead for surgery			2
' although i 'm ecstatic for @entity0 , it 's definitely been traumatic seeing the transformation she 's gone through			2
@entity0 lost 11 stone , taking her to 8.8 stone , and from a size 30 to an eight ' sometimes i look at her and think " you 're nothing like me anymore " and i think she thinks the same			1
' when she was big neither of us liked having our pictures taken and now that she 's slim she 's more , " look at me now "			2
' every time she has her picture taken it goes up on @entity164 and i 'm like , " here we go again "			0
' but i 'm not jealous of what she 's achieved			0
if anything i wish it was me that had lost the weight			0
' at the end of the day she 's done so well and she deserves it			0
we 're still best mates and it will take more than this to make me see her differently			0
