by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 10 august 2013 federal authorities will arrest two former @entity3 employees on suspicion that they tried to conceal losses incurred by the infamous ' @entity5			1
' @entity7 and @entity8 are expected to be arrested in @entity9 in coming days for their part in trying to conceal the investment bank 's $ 6 billion trading loss last year , the @entity6 first reported friday			1
@entity5 , the trader known as the @entity5 , will not be arrested			0
cooperating with investigators and is considered key to any prosecution , @entity5 is not likley to be charged over the series of events that led to the scandal			2
staggering losses : @entity3 lost over $ 6billion from the @entity5 scandal @entity7 oversaw @entity3 's trading strategy in @entity9 , while @entity22 recorded the value of the soured investments , according to the @entity6 , which said a federal grand jury moved to indict both on criminal fraud charges			1
federal investigators concluded that @entity7 ordered @entity22 to falsify records and conceal more than $ 400 million in losses from their superiors at the bank , the newspaper reported			1
likely to be extradited to the @entity35 under an agreement with @entity38 authorities , it is not clear where the two men are located , they are nationals of other @entity43 countries , according to the @entity6			1
the charges against @entity7 and @entity22 hinge on the cooperation of @entity5 , the @entity3 in @entity9 who placed the large bets that led to the loss , according to the report			2
@entity50 is also close to a settlement with the @entity52 requiring the bank - by assets , the largest in the country - to admit fault , according to separate @entity6 report			1
despite the pending settlement with the @entity52 , the @entity59 and federal prosecutors are trying to determine if executives misled investors with their under - representation of the magnitude of the losses , according to a separate @entity6 report			2
the beleaguered firm is also facing fines from @entity38 's @entity69 , the @entity6 reported			0
chief executive @entity70 famously referred to the scandal as a ' tempest in a teapot ' early on , words that came to haunt him as the firm came to realize the staggering losses incurred by @entity5 and co. ' there was no hiding , there was no lying , there was no bullsh --- ing , period , ' @entity70 pleaded during a conference in @entity87 this past june			1
initially misled : @entity3 chairman and ceo @entity70 testified in june about the scandal during a @entity35 @entity90 hearing on @entity91 @entity5 incurred a stunning portfolio of derivatives positions as a trader in the firm 's chief investment office in @entity9 , @entity97			1

designed with varying degrees of complexity , it is possible to earn a profit or insure against potential loss regardless of how a company performs , depending on the type of contract used			0
@entity5 is not likely to be charged because investigators have concluded he was unfairly blamed , according to @entity122			0
charges against the firm 's top executives are also highly unlikely , the @entity6 noted			0
@entity70 reportedly reviewed the division 's profit and loss reports for large positions every day			0
the alleged actions of both @entity7 and @entity22 are said by regulators to have led to the surprising disconnect between anticipated and actual losses			2
the @entity35 attorney 's office in @entity87 declined to comment late friday			2
a call left with the @entity59 office in @entity87 was not immediately returned			0
the trading loss disclosed in 2012 was an embarrassment for the biggest @entity35 bank and raised concerns about risk - taking at @entity144 banks four years after the financial crisis .			1

@entity3 over $ 6billion from the scandal
executives initially thought losses would mount to a ' tempest in a teapot '
