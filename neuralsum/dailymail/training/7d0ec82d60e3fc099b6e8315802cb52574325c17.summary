taxi apps such as @entity1 and @entity2 are used to ‘ e-hail ’ a taxi every two seconds			1
and as these apps become smarter , experts predict they will sync with social networks and calendars to provide an even more efficient and tailored service to their passengers			1
tvs in the back of cabs could automatically change channel based on a user ’s likes of dislikes , for example , or drivers could anticipate when and where a passenger will need a ride – even before the customer does			1
for example , tv channels in the back of cars could broadcast favourite shows based on @entity37 , or could track a user ’s schedule the predictions were made in @entity1 ’s @entity42 report , unveiled at an event in @entity44 alongside a range of new features			1
‘ in the next few years , the apps we use will begin to understand what we are doing and become more contextual , ’ explained the report			2
‘ for @entity1 , the app will know when you are leaving a client meeting and send a taxi to meet you			1
’ the report claims that the technology people carry with them is giving more control over what they do ; allowing taxi apps to adapt the city to their needs , rather than the other way around it was written by leading futurologists , @entity63 and @entity64			1
‘ apps are already familiar , but the internet of things will integrate them , letting people interact with their surroundings much better , ' said mr @entity64			0
earlier this week , designers at @entity73 - based @entity72 unveiled their @entity75 prototype , that uses heel clicks to order a taxi			2
@entity75 is powered by the @entity78 - an @entity80 micro-controller inside a @entity81 insert - and features an accelerometer , and a cell battery			0
the @entity81 clips onto any shoe and connects wirelessly to the @entity75 app and a ‘ trigger ’ is activated using three clicks of the heel - and these triggers can be customised			0
the prototype version ’s triggers include receiving a call , sending a template text to three friends or ordering an @entity2 taxi			1
when the onboard accelerometer detects clicks , it sends a signal to the connected phone via @entity102			0
he added that such apps may evolve to accommodate gestures such as snapping fingers , or using spoken commands to order taxis automatically			2
and as wearables increase in popularity , waving a hand to hail a cab will easily be detected by an electronic ring or wristband			0

elsewhere in the @entity42 report , so - called ‘ digital bubbles ’ will make it easier for taxi app users to find dates by highlighting strangers with compatible profiles and diary availability			1
and , with a list of customer preferences sent during the booking procedure , drivers could advise their passengers where to visit , adding a personal touch , especially for tourists			2

and , with a list of customer preferences sent during the booking procedure , drivers could advise passengers where to visit within the next five years , as self - driving technologies become more mainstream , the futurologists predict that many cars will converge with the high street			1
in addition to carrying passengers , self - driving cars , such as @entity178 's prototype and @entity180 ' @entity179 , as well as traditional taxis , may also become delivery drivers			1
this means people could order a taxi to collect dry cleaning , for example , or deliver medicine using a single app. @entity2 announced earlier this week that it was partnering @entity191			1
the service delivers a registered nurse and a vaccine kit for up to 10 people , when ordered through the @entity2 app. within five years , as self - driving technologies become more mainstream , futurologists predict many cars will converge with the high street			1

it is part of the pilot launch of the @entity219 program			0
@entity2 has previously used this so - called , ‘ on - demand model ’ to deliver ice creams , and @entity222 gifts			0
@entity63 predicts that taxi apps and services will use such models to become more tailored to the passenger ’s needs			1
‘ by combining big data with algorithms and statistical analysis , we can create a more intelligent service , ' he wrote			0
‘ by mapping the movements of people from their mobile devices , it is possible to predict a need in advance of the event itself			0
‘ imagine , in the future , your @entity1 cab is on its way to you before you even know you need it			0
’ he continued that through the use of personal data , taxis will be able to deliver a unique service			1

the app launched in two new @entity255 cities , @entity256 and @entity257 , this week , and is now available in @entity258			0

‘ the in - cab media will be showing you a relevant tv channel			0
or maybe you want to work , in which case you ’ll be offered a quiet , undisturbed journey ? ‘ alternatively , perhaps you are planning to catch - up your favourite team ’s game on tv when you get home ? the driver will know you do n’t want to hear the score			0
’ the experts also predict that owning a car will be a thing of the past as taxi apps expand to more regions and become alternatives to owning vehicles , especially in busy cities			1

people hailing taxis on the street can now pay for them using their @entity1 app - even if the cab is n't managed by @entity1 , too			2
@entity2 also launched a new service called @entity300 , which lets users book a ride with seating for up to six people in @entity44 and up to eight in @entity305 .			0

taxi apps including @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity26 have created a culture of e-hailing
as they become smarter , these apps will sync with social networks , calendars and other personal data to learn about passengers
tvs and radios in cars will show favourite shows based on @entity37
they could anticipate busy *periods* and send taxis before passengers know they want them
apps could also track a user ’s schedule and anticipate meetings
futurologists have *discussed* these points in @entity1 's @entity42 report
