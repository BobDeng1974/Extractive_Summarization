last week , the mission was declassified , and the report and photos of the effort to recover the @entity17 satellite were made available for public consumption			1
the satellite was one of three that was sent into orbit to provide a bird ’s eye view of the @entity24 and @entity25 and other potential foes during the @entity8			1
for months , the satellite - and its 60 miles of film - were lost on the sea floor			2
@entity43 reported that two missions to retrieve the satellite in 1971 failed , but the @entity46 tried again on april 25 , 1972			2
in the third mission , the @entity46 used its @entity48 – complete with a mechanical arm – to bring the @entity17 to the surface			2
helping hand : the @entity17 is lifted out of the water by a giant mechanical arm there was , however , one setback			2
the report said : ' the third attempt was successful in locating and securing the film stacks ; however , as the @entity60 was surfacing , the film broke into pieces			0
twenty - five feet was recovered			0
' what the @entity46 took away from the recovery mission was the proper actions to carry out such salvage missions in the future			0
success ? the attempt was successful in locating and securing the film stacks ; however , as the @entity60 was surfacing , the film broke into pieces the highly classified @entity17 satellite , also known as the @entity73 , was not seen publicly until september of last year			1

hook : the @entity46 was able to fish out the satellite with the help of this device never - before - seen : the report and photos of the effort to recover the @entity17 satellite were made available for public consumption last week those who developed it worked long hours under tight deadlines , missing family holidays and anniversaries , and could tell no one - not even their wives and children - what they were up to			1
big bird was first placed in orbit in 1971 and was one of the most advanced spy satellites of its time , producing images of the @entity24 , @entity25 and other countries that held strategic importance for the @entity113 government			1
the film was shot back through the earth 's atmosphere in buckets that parachuted over the @entity39 , where @entity120 @entity119 planes snagged them with grappling hooks			0

@entity113 made daring effort to retrieve @entity17 satellite from ocean floor back in 1972
