by @entity0 meat and milk from the offspring of clone farm animals should be allowed on to supermarket shelves without labels , according to @entity8 officials			0
the proposals , which would keep families in the dark about what they are eating , were outlined today in a move that was condemned by consumer groups			1
the idea of cloning animals for food may seem bizarre and akin to science fiction , however it is possible that beef and milk from the offspring of clones is already being imported here from the @entity24 and other countries			1
milk and meat from offspring of clone animals should be sold without labels , @entity8 officials have said ( file picture ) separately , the @entity32 has revealed attempts to rear clone animal offspring in the @entity35 to produce milk for breakfast tables dating back to 2008			0
it emerged three years ago that a @entity39 farmer had purchased two bulls , which were the sons of a clone , and then bred 92 @entity43 milking cows from them			1
initially , he planned to sell the milk in the @entity35 , however following a consumer backlash , he decided to destroy more than 40 of the cows and exported around 30 to @entity48			0
the @entity50 consumer body , @entity51 , condemned any proposal that does not require the labelling of food from clone offspring attempts to breed clones in the past has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and malformed organs			1
there is also a problem of ' gigantism ' , with new - borns so large they have to be removed by caesarean section			0
some animals , including the original clone @entity70 , created by the @entity71 in @entity39 , suffer the early onset of crippling arthritis			0
in 2008 , the @entity74 on @entity75 expressed doubts that animal cloning for food production can be justified , citing ‘ the current level of suffering and health problems ’			1
research by @entity35 ’s @entity82 ( @entity82 ) shows the majority of consumers oppose the idea of cloning for food with concerns both for animal welfare and human health			2
if cloning is allowed , the research shows that most people want any resulting food , whether from clones or their offspring , to be labelled			1
the new proposals from the @entity98 would ban the sale of food from clones , however there would be no such controls on food from their sons and daughters			1
the @entity50 consumer body , @entity51 , condemned any proposal that does not require the labelling of food from clone offspring			2
it said : ‘ currently , cloning for food production is not used in the @entity8			2
however , imports - mainly meat - from the @entity24 , @entity114 and @entity115 can come from clone offspring			0
the proposals from the @entity98 would ban the sale of food from clones but no such controls would be in place on food from their sons and daughters ‘ without effective labelling , @entity50 consumers have no knowledge of what their @entity114 steak or @entity24 beef is made of as traceability systems for cloned food do not exist in these countries			1
’ the @entity51 director general , @entity133 ( correct ) , said : ‘ if @entity50 is to open the floodgates to meat from the offspring of clones , the least it can do is to allow consumers a choice by labelling such foods			2
‘ an overwhelming 83per cent of consumers voiced their concerns and have said ‘ no ’ to steak and milk from clones and their offspring			0
if consumers are opposed to cloning for food production , why is the debate still open ? ’			0

@entity98 proposals would ban sale of food from clones
but there would be no controls on food from their sons and daughters
