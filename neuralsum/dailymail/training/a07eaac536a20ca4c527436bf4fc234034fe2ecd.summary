taking a wrong turn into a lake would usually require an embarrassed call to your insurer			2
not so if you 're driving the panther , which can switch from car to boat in just 15 seconds			2
the amphibious vehicle , which can hit speeds of 80mph - plus on land and up to 45mph in water , is the brainchild of @entity14 manufacturer @entity13			1
founder @entity15 set - up the company back in 1999 with the aim of shattering the world record for the fastest amphibious vehicle			1
drive on water : the panther , created by @entity14 manufacturer @entity13 , can go from car to boat in 15 seconds in demand : the $ 155,000 ( £ 96,000 ) amphibious vehicle has an 18 month backlog of orders and in 2010 he did exactly that when @entity13 's @entity31 model reached a top speed of 60mph ( 52 knots ) on water			1
the @entity31 was never sold to the public due to its high production costs , but a new model - @entity38 - went on sale in july 2013 and the company now has an 18 month backlog of orders			1
@entity38 costs $ 155,000 ( £ 96,000 ) and features a lightweight chromoly steel chassis and fibreglass hull , as well as a hydraulic off - road suspension which retracts the wheels in under eight seconds			2
off road : the panther reaches speeds of 80mph on land and 45mph in the water and the car comes equipped with a 3.7 litre @entity55 engine - meaning that when it comes to speed , it 's more than a match for it 's more traditional sea - fairing companions			0
its unique amphibious nature has made it a must - have status symbol and @entity13 have received an influx of orders from the super-rich , including @entity66 billionaires and the crown prince of @entity68 - who is reported to own several			1
@entity13 spokesman @entity69 , 30 , said : ' we have sold cars to some of the wealthiest and powerful people imaginable			1
development : a 2010 model , @entity31 , could reach up to 60mph in the water , but was too expensive to produce for public sale @entity78 : orders have been placed by everyone from the @entity81 of @entity68 to @entity66 billionaires ' you never know who is sending in a deposit until we begin building the car for that somebody and realise who they are			1
' most requests have been colour schemes that match personal helicopters , mega yachts , luxury cars , county colors , and even just plain and subtle so that nobody would even know the car is amphibious			0
' @entity38 is fully customisable - meaning the buyer has control over everything from hull colour to paint , interior , dashboard , gauges , steering wheel and seats			0
march added : ' the best part about the panther is it drives better than most boats on water and can travel more places on land than most cars			0
' make it match the chopper ' : super-rich clients have requested paint jobs to match their mega yachts , helicopters and luxury cars multi-talented : @entity38 ' drives better than most boats on water and can travel more places on land than most cars ' , says @entity13 ' the design process has not been easy			1
there are no books and there has been little to no research on amphibious technology			0
there have been thousands of attempts at amphibious vehicles but we have literally had to start from nothing			0
' i 'd say the biggest problem we faced was getting a car meant for land to plane on water like a boat			0
that is no easy task			0
' it has taken much longer than anticipated but it feels amazing			0
we set out to design and build an amazing vehicle and we have done just that			2
there is no other vehicle in the world like it			2
