’ @entity1 , who is currently playing in @entity32 during the @entity2 offseason , writes that while she never promoted her sexuality at @entity34 , she never hid it , either			1
she believes the university was conveniently hypocritical about their views on student ’s sexuality when it suited them - such as when it came to attracting talented sports stars			1
‘ the more i think about it , the more i feel like the people who run the school want it both ways : they want to keep the policy , so they can keep selling themselves as a @entity50 university , but they are more than happy to benefit from the success of their gay athletes			1
that is , as long as those gay athletes do n’t talk about being gay , ’ she wrote			2
in her book in my skin writes about how she was open about her sexuality with coach @entity21 even before she joined @entity1 was a three - time @entity61 all - american who is the @entity62 ’s all - time leader in blocked shots , and led the @entity64 to the 2012 national title			1
last year she was named ' @entity66 ' for her 2012 - 13 season at @entity6 at the @entity68 , just weeks after officially coming out as gay - ahead of the @entity2 draft			1

' i was always taller , my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper , ' said @entity1 , who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches			1
in an honest interview with the @entity83 , the @entity81 powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students			1
still friends : @entity1 explained in an interview that @entity21 ( right ) and staff at @entity6 thought being open about sexual preferences could potentially damage the programme 's recruitment success and reputation as @entity1 made her way through the crowd , a male student stopped her			1
' you 're a dude , ' he said			0
' i just stood there and took it			0
the whole school was laughing at me , ' @entity1 recalled			1
' when i was younger , it really bothered me to the point where i was like " i do n't even want to be alive ; why am i getting treated like that ? " ' @entity1 said			2
' but as i got older , i started caring less			0
' she said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school			2
' i felt a release , i felt better , ' @entity1 said			2
' she was so cool about it			0
she was like " i kinda already know , and i love you			0
" ' her father , a @entity114 , did n't take it so well and tension between the two saw @entity1 move out in her senior year			2
bullying : the @entity81 star was bullied at school , with some peers even calling her ' a dude ' tall : ' i was always taller , my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper , ' said @entity1 , who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches despite her tumultuous home life , on court she shone , leading her team from @entity130 's @entity129 to the @entity133 girls ' basketball state championship game and becoming @entity134 's most sought after recruit			1
but she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides , which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games , she said			0
she went off to college at @entity6 with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her			2
and by the end of sophomore year she succeeded			0
but she said she chose to publicly come out last april , regardless of the fallout , to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to			0
' i did n't have a real role model that i could look up to that was out openly , ' she told @entity153			0
' i knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone			0
' history : @entity1 ( pictured hugging @entity21 ) was named ' @entity66 ' for her 2012 - 13 season at @entity6 at the @entity68 last year though @entity1 said she never hid the fact that she was gay from friends and family , she found at @entity6 there was ' an unwritten law ' that players should n't discuss their sexual preferences			1
speaking to @entity167 last may , she recalled : ' ... it was just kind of , like , one of those things , you know , just do n't do it			0
they kind of tried to make it , like , ' why put your business out on the street like that ? ' " she explained that when @entity21 recruited her , she was honest about who she was			0
' i told @entity181 [ @entity21 ] when she was recruiting me			0
i was like , " i 'm gay			0
i hope that 's not a problem , " and she told me that it was n't , ' @entity1 said			1
' i mean , my teammates knew , obviously they all knew			0
' but when one of @entity1 's tweets to an ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at @entity6 , she was told to take the post down by ' someone in the office			1
' ' it was a recruiting thing , ' @entity1 added			2
' the coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it , people would n't let their kids come play for @entity6			2

the @entity81 star came out as a lesbian before the @entity2 draft last april
she was accepted at @entity6 , a @entity210 university , despite telling her coach that she was a lesbian
however she was told to keep ' her business ' to herself
she questions the university 's hypocrisy over accepting gay sports stars *provided* they keep it quiet so as not to offend *patrons*
@entity1 is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches
