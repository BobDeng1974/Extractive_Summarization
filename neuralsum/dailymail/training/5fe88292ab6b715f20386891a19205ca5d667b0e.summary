the possibility was raised after observers dug out the july 13 edition of @entity14 's ' @entity13 ' and pointed to extraordinary parallels between the letter and the now scandalous love tryst that led the general to hand in his resignation as details of the affair came to light			1
but yesterday , the editor of the @entity3 magazine denied that the column and the @entity9 scandal are related			1
was the fact that @entity28 ( left ) having an affair with @entity9 known by her husband @entity30 ( right ) and did he write an anonymous letter to the @entity3 advice column for help ? denial : @entity3 magazine editor @entity35 tweeted yesterday that the advice @entity13 column in question was not from @entity39 , the husband of alleged @entity9 mistress @entity28 @entity35 tweeted : ' this @ theethicist column ... is not about the @entity9 affair , based on our factchecking			1
strange , i know '			0
writing about a deepening relationship he knew his wife was having with a ' government executive ' whose job ' is seen worldwide as a demonstration of @entity52 leadership ' the anonymous man offers up what could be considered in hindsight as striking information			1
the letter writer explains that ' exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort , ' and asks ' @entity13 ' whether it is ok for him to ' suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project			1
' indeed , he seems pained to make it clear he believes the mission ' must succeed ' and wants to know if he should confront his wife in some way and ' finally force closure ' or if he should ' suffer in silence for the next year or two			2
' ' affair ' : @entity28 and @entity9 , pictured , reportedly had an affair that led to his resignation the reader tells ' @entity13 ' that has ' watched the affair intensify over the last year ' - which matches the timeline of the affair from august 2011 until about several months ago			1
@entity78 writer @entity77 asked , ' what government executive is not having an affair with some guy 's wife ? ' another writer with the publication added , ' would anyone really repeatedly refer to heading the @entity86 as a ' project ' ? does n't sound quite right			1
' those supporting the belief that the letter came from @entity39 , point to @entity14 's insightful reply to the anonymous man 's dilemma			1
he tells the letter writer that he should tell his wife he wanted to separate , ' just as you would if she were sleeping with the mailman			1
' ' other woman ' : @entity28 , left , is married and has two children			2
@entity9 has been married to his wife @entity100 , pictured right , for 37 years , and they also have two children close : @entity28 first met @entity9 when he visited @entity102 , where she was a student he claims there is no reason to reveal the affair in a public fashion , but having offered this clear - cut advice he goes slightly further			1
' the fact that you ’re willing to accept your wife ’s infidelity for some greater political good is beyond honorable , ' replied @entity14 on july 13 to the letter			1
' in fact , it ’s so over-the - top honorable that i ’m not sure i believe your motives are real			2
' part of me wonders why you ’re even posing this question , particularly in a column that is printed in the @entity3			1
' i halfway suspect you ’re writing this letter because you want specific people to read this column and deduce who is involved and what ’s really going on behind closed doors ( without actually addressing the conflict in person )			2
' that ’s not ethical , either			0
' ' my wife is having an affair with a government executive			1
his role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of @entity52 leadership			1
( this might seem hyperbolic , but it is not an exaggeration			0
) ' i have met with him on several occasions , and he has been gracious			0
( i doubt if he is aware of my knowledge			0
) i have watched the affair intensify over the last year , and i have also benefited from his generosity			0
' he is engaged in work that i am passionate about and is absolutely the right person for the job			0
i strongly feel that exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort			0
' my issue : should i acknowledge this affair and finally force closure ? should i suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project i feel must succeed ? ' should i be “ true to my heart ” and walk away from the entire miserable situation and put the episode behind me ?

it was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with @entity180 's re-election tuesday			0
the @entity86 has come under intense scrutiny for providing the @entity204 and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the @entity226 attack was a result of a film protest , not a militant terror attack			0
it has become clear that the @entity86 was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the @entity233 world			0
@entity202 rather than @entity9 now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in @entity226 , which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			2

embedded : @entity28 , pictured here in @entity174 , has more than a decade of @entity52 military service for the director of the @entity86 , being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat			1
if a foreign government had learned of the affair , the reasoning goes , @entity9 or @entity28 could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised			1

failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank and file that such behavior is acceptable			0
