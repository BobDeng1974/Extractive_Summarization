his face twisted in fury , @entity0 punches his fist into the air and launches into an @entity6 war cry			1
‘ burn , burn @entity13 , ’ he yells from his prime spot at the front of one of the most notorious rallies in recent times			1
once the crowd is whipped into a fever , an @entity13 flag is set on fire and held aloft by a fanatic			1
@entity20 footage shows mr @entity0 desperately trying to hold the burning flag as the chanting behind him intensifies			1
as the remainder of the flag burns on the ground , mr @entity0 chants ‘ @entity48 ’			1
he pushes the palm of his hand repeatedly toward the embers , rejoicing at the destruction of the stars and stripes			0
mr @entity0 – the father of one of the three schoolgirls who fled @entity25 to join @entity57 – then turns his attention to a burning @entity60 flag on the floor and begins to chant and gesture toward it			1
he is one of a dozen fanatics standing behind a banner which proclaims : ‘ the followers of @entity66 will conquer @entity13			2
’ behind him , hundreds of fanatics repeatedly chant incendiary slogans while holding menacing black jihadi flags			2
among the rabble - rousers was notorious hate preacher @entity71 , who has led a number of @entity74 groups that were subsequently banned			1
alongside him stood @entity28 , one of the two @entity6 converts who murdered and almost beheaded fusilier @entity29 in the name of @entity78 eight months later			1
@entity79 : also at the rally was @entity28 who went on to murder soldier @entity29 the following year respectable : @entity0 , pictured far right , giving evidence to the @entity82 following his daughter 's disappearance			1
the report was released this week @entity86 , infamous for heckling former home secretary @entity87 in 2006 , also led some of the chanting			2
but last month mr @entity0 gave evidence to @entity91 refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls ’ actions , instead seeking to blame the police , teachers , @entity98 officials and others			1
in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee , mr @entity0 , who was with the families of the other two girls , denied even knowing what @entity6 radicalisation was			2
cuddly : @entity0 appealing for the return of his ' jihadi daughter ' a few weeks ago after she ran off ‘ as for me , i do n’t know the symptoms even — what radicalisation is , ’ he told mps			1
mr @entity0 also repeatedly blasted the @entity111 for handing a letter to his daughter requesting parental permission to speak to the girls about a friend who had earlier travelled to @entity117			1
he said police officers should have given it directly to the families			0
he said : ‘ i strongly disagree with the letter being given to 15 - year - old girls			0
the word “ police ” by itself and “ terrorism ” or “ counter-terrorism ” , as global issues – it is a heavy burden for a 15 - year - old to deal with that			1
we also feel that we are neglected as parents			0
‘ we are supposed to know these things			0
the letter destructs our daughter , destructs our family and terrorises our children			0
what we want to know is : apart from this letter , what was the verbal conversation with this child ? i know my daughter			0
she is the kind of girl who , if it is sunset , she will call me to pick her up			0
‘ how on earth she travelled abroad to join @entity26 , is a very difficult question for us to answer – even to predicate			1
the letter terrified my daughter			0
’ the families were led by their lawyer @entity151 , once the representative of a close associate of the @entity155 killers , who repeatedly demanded an apology			0
mr @entity151 , who has posted extremist views on his @entity159 page , accused @entity160 of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in february and their close friend in december			0
in a 45 - minute grilling in front of the families , met commissioner sir @entity167 was forced to apologise for failing to communicate more directly with the families			0
giving evidence to the committee , mr @entity0 claimed he did not know that his daughter @entity175 might have been exposed to radical views			1
chairman @entity177 pressed him on this point , asking him : ‘ did it come to your attention in any way that they were involved in the kinds of things that it is alleged that they were involved in following this becoming public ? ’ mr @entity0 replied : ‘ not at all			2
’ chilling : a @entity190 image of 15 - year - old @entity191 , @entity192 , 16 , and @entity193 , 15 , at @entity194 before they caught their flight to @entity98 fanaticism : footage of the controversial rally showed mr @entity0 chanting among the crowds of protesters			1
the demonstration , held in 2012 , was led by firebrand preacher @entity71 and attended by @entity29 's killer extremist : the protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser @entity71 , who made a speech saying that @entity209 would take over the entire world , including @entity13 and the @entity25 shocking : @entity160 said it would examine the footage ( pictured ) to see if any criminal offences had been committed what the @entity213 were not told was that mr @entity0 was caught on camera in one of a wave of demonstrations that took place across the world in september 2012			1
thousands had taken to the streets to protest against an obscure film called @entity224 , criticised for ridiculing @entity6			0
in @entity36 , more than 150 clashed with police outside the @entity13 embassy			2
they included @entity230 radicals @entity228 , who is fighting for @entity57 , and @entity231 , who was the subject of a @entity234 exposé called @entity235 and prejudiced			0
radical : @entity191 , 15 , daughter of @entity0 , travelled to @entity117 with two other girls @entity228 has called for @entity238 to be executed , suggested that @entity57 - style executions take place in @entity241 and threatened to blow up @entity242			1
last night members of the commons committee expressed their shock and astonishment over mr @entity0 ’s activities			2
@entity249 mp @entity248 said : ‘ it is extraordinary that this man blamed the police , the government , the school , the @entity98 government and everyone else for his daughter ’s decision to go to @entity117 but failed to mention his own involvement in an appalling @entity74 rally			1
perhaps the committee should invite mr @entity0 back so he can explain what he was doing			2
’ @entity264 mp @entity263 , who also sits on the committee , said : ‘ this will come as a surprise to those who heard criticism of the police and school			0
this raises serious questions about the potential negative influence on an impressionable young mind			0
’ mr @entity177 said : ‘ it is clear that families and communities need to take greater responsibility for protecting young people who could be at risk of radicalisation			0
‘ witnesses before the committee are responsible for their own statements			0
when mr @entity0 gave evidence , he said he had no idea that his daughter had been involved in radicalisation or had been radicalised			2
’ @entity175 fled with her friends @entity193 , 15 , and @entity192 , 16 , from their homes in east @entity36 to @entity117 last month			2
the trio were following in the footsteps of @entity293 , who left their school , @entity295 in @entity36 , to go to @entity117 in december			0
