@entity1 legend @entity0 tells @entity2 where he thinks @entity4 's clash with @entity5 at @entity6 will be won ... head to heads @entity10 v @entity8 if there is one genius in @entity15 rugby at the moment , it ’s @entity10			1
the kid is so talented and skilful that something happens every time he gets the ball so @entity5 will need to focus on him			2
he is up against @entity8 , who is not as easy on the eye but is a very solid unit for @entity5 — hence why they have made him captain			2
he reminds me of former @entity27 flanker @entity26 — someone you do n’t really notice but is so important for the team			0
@entity4 centre @entity10 was in scintillating form during his side 's recent destruction of @entity35 @entity8 is back to anchor the @entity5 midfield against the top 14 giants @entity38 vs @entity39 @entity38 may be a flanker and @entity39 a no 8 , but when you play flanker , you ’re the first man who is going to tackle the no 8			1
@entity5 will be looking to launch @entity45 as chief ball - carrier from the back of the scrum and @entity38 will be there to stop him			2
@entity51 performs a similar running role for @entity4 , but @entity39 is key to @entity5 ’ game plan			1
no 8 @entity39 is a @entity5 ' most devastating ball carrier and his power will be needed on saturday @entity58 v @entity56 how will @entity58 handle the occasion ? his skills and game management are second - to - none , but he has been known to succumb to the pressure on the big stage			1
@entity5 will try to get in his face early to disrupt the rhythm			0
@entity56 has been around for a long time now and is enjoying some good form			2
@entity67 @entity69 defence a red and black wall of defenders stopped @entity4 from scoring a try in last year ’s semi-final , which @entity5 won so ruthlessly			1
their defensive line was up so quickly and @entity4 were taken by surprise			2
when you play against that sort of rush defence , you need to stand deeper in attack and maybe exploit it by kicking over the top			0
but @entity4 are most effective with the ball in hand , especially with their back - three combination of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity90 @entity89			0
former @entity91 full back @entity89 is just one of several dangerous backs at @entity4 's disposal breakdown battle in @entity1 , training is geared more towards flair and creativity so less time is spent working on the breakdown			0
during my time with @entity102 , we spent hours focusing on the post-tackle area			0
@entity4 will fear @entity104 after his performance on the flank last year and they must work hard to nullify him around the edges of the breakdown			1
the key for the @entity15 is to keep their discipline and not concede penalties			0
@entity4 will be wary of @entity5 flanker @entity104 following his tour - de - force in @entity113 last year silence the crowd although this game is being played at a ‘ neutral ’ venue , it will still feel like a home game for @entity4			1
the top 14 side have the best supporters in @entity15 rugby and it ’s only a 90 - mile journey to the @entity124 in @entity125 for their fans , who follow their side everywhere			1
@entity5 must be wary of the reception they ’ll get but they can keep the fans quiet by building an early lead			0
when @entity4 are behind , their heads can drop			0
but my gut tells me they will come away with the win today			0
@entity4 warm up in front of their fans at @entity138 before their top 14 game against @entity140			1

@entity5 skipper @entity8 will line up *opposite* @entity10
flanker @entity38 will be *tasked* with stopping @entity39
@entity56 is enjoying a rich vein of form at present
@entity4 will fear @entity104 after his performance last year
the top 14 side have the best supporters in @entity15 rugby
