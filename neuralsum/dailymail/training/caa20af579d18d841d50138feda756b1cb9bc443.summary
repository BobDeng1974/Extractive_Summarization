by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 19:23 est , 16 july 2012 at the end of the day , all things considered , it has to be said we do waffle on a bit			0
in fact , the average adult wastes 1.7million words over a lifetime while struggling to make a point , according to a study			0
rather than get to the point , @entity13 skirt around issues and use long - winded phrases to hide what they really think leading to confusion and arguments according to an @entity21 survey			1
argument starter : @entity13 sarcasm often gets laugh , but nearly 50 per cent of @entity13 admit it 's been misinterpreted and in some cases , caused an argument with thousands of foreigners coming to the @entity28 for the @entity29 , many tourists might be left baffled by our evasiveness and superfluous words with double meanings			1
foreigners are n't the only ones who have trouble understanding , with a third of us struggling to decipher what people really mean and 46 per cent wishing we could be more direct talking like @entity42 who are known for their straight talking			1
@entity13 sarcasm has got nearly half of @entity13 into am awkward situation after it has been misinterpreted , with two in five revealing it led to an argument or dispute			2
according to the survey , three quarters of us admit to regularly using the word ‘ maybe ’ when we mean ‘ no ’ , while three fifths often say ‘ i ’m fine ’ when we are really thinking ‘ i ’m not , stop asking ’			0
other offending phrases include saying ‘ it ’s ok ’ when we are really thinking ‘ i am really disappointed ’ and telling workmates ‘ could we consider some other options ? ’ when what we really mean is ‘ i do n’t like your idea ’			0
the ultimate snub , which a third admit saying , is ‘ i understand what you are saying ’ when actually what we really want to say is ‘ i disagree and do not want to discuss it further ’			0
saying ‘ that ’s not bad ’ actually mean ‘ that ’s good ’ while in true @entity13 style 29 per cent shy away from confrontation by using the phrase ‘ i kind of agree ’ when really they do not agree at all			1
@entity13 are worse in the workplace with two - fifths avoiding straight talking by not being direct enough with colleagues			2
according to the @entity75 over a lifetime @entity13 use 1.7 million unnecessary words - 60 words every day , 420 needless words a week and 21,840 a year but when it comes to family and friends we have no qualms telling our true thoughts			2
the @entity86 ’s @entity13 vice president @entity85 said : ‘ we suspected that @entity87 often beat around the bush when making a point , but our results prove this is the case with the average person using almost two million unnecessary words in a lifetime			0
' the crowds are coming : thousands of foreigners will descend on @entity28 for the @entity29 and many might struggle to understand when @entity13 do n't speak their mind to tackle the problem the company has launched a ‘ guide to @entity13 ’ translator to help foreigners cope with the quirky nuances and learn the jargon of our language			1
mr @entity85 said : ‘ what better way to teach other nations @entity13 jargon than a “ guide to @entity13 ” translator ? ‘ our brand is all about giving the @entity13 a taste of @entity42 and we hope our guide breaks down the waffle to reveal a nation of straight talkers			1
