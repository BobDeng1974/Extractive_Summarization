there was only one present @entity2 wanted for @entity3 this year			1
the brave tot has just been given a new hand for @entity3 - after being born without fully formed arms or hands			1
it means that little @entity2 , five , can now open his @entity3 presents and pull crackers with his mother @entity11 , 29			1
@entity11 who lives in @entity12 , @entity13 , said : ‘ we are going to have a wonderful @entity3 this year			1
‘ @entity2 is thrilled with his new hand			2
he ca n’t stop smiling			0
it means that he can do so much more now that he can grip things like his presents and pull crackers too			1
five - year - old @entity2 is delighted with new hand which means he can now open his own @entity3 presents and pull crackers the youngster was born without fully formed arms or legs , but preferred to live without the prosthetic arm he had fitted at six months ' he is so excited for @entity3 now he ’s got his new hand			1
’ it was n’t until he was born that @entity11 realised there was anything wrong with @entity2			1
nothing had been picked up during her pregnancy scans and it was only when he was born that she was told that there was a problem with the development of his arms			0
she said : ‘ it was a massive shock to me when i found out			0
my mum and aunty were in the delivery room at the hospital with me and i saw the shock on my aunt ’s face when she saw him for the first time			0
‘ then the midwife told me that he was perfect , but there were some problems with his arms			0
i could see that his left arm stopped above the elbow and he only had a very small arm on his right side			0
‘ there was no explanation for why it had happened in the womb , i was told it was just one of those things			0
but it was a massive shock to me as i had n’t imagined anything would be wrong with him			0
’ @entity2 had a prosthetic arm fitted at six months old , to help him balance when he crawled , but he preferred to try without it			1
@entity11 , who is single , said : ‘ he never used his prosthetic arm that he had when he was a baby , and he managed fine without it			1
he learnt to crawl and walk and he would also pick things up like a ball by balancing it between his two stumps			2
doctors at @entity68 's @entity67 made @entity2 a new hand with fingers that open and close and it was fitted last month , just in time for @entity3 @entity2 's mother @entity11 said : ' it really is the best present that @entity2 could ever have wished for ' ‘ when he was a baby he just played with his plastic arm just like he would do a toy , then as he grew into a toddler he ignored it			1
‘ he never needed anything else , he just adapted to doing things without any proper hands			2
but then a few months ago he started to say that he really wanted a hand with five fingers , just like everyone else			2
‘ he started school in september and he just wanted to be like the other children			0
’ so @entity11 took him to the @entity67 in @entity68 and doctors made him a prosthetic hand with fingers that opened and closed			1
he was fitted for the prosthetic arm and it was finally ready earlier this month - just in time for @entity3			1
@entity11 , who is supported by @entity91 , a charity that helps children with upper limb deformities , said : ‘ it really is the best present that @entity2 could ever have wished for			2
' he was thrilled when he tried on his new hand for the first time , and could pick things up properly			2
he is able to pick his toys up for the first time too			0
it has given him so much more independence and confidence			0
‘ he has always managed really well , but now he can feel more like the other children now that he ’s got his new hand			0
' it was wonderful to see him being able to pull @entity3 crackers for the first time this year			2
it ’s something that i never thought i ’d be able to see			0
