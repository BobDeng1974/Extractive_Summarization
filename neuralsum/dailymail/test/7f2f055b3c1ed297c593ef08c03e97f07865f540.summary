while it might be the nation 's largest grocer , @entity0 was ranked at the bottom of the barrel in a recent survey of @entity6 's supermarkets			1
the retailer has consistently been one of the lowest - rated grocers since 2005 in @entity11 ' annual survey , and this year it was rated number 67 , the second worst supermarket			1
as it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine , @entity0 is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce			2
however , it was noted for its better - than - average prices			0
@entity0 was ranked the second worst supermarket in @entity11 ' annual supermarket survey the retailer ( above a worker in the produce section of a @entity0 in @entity28 ) came in at number 67 followed by chain @entity30 , which was in last place ' every store i go in has room to improve , ' said @entity0 ceo @entity35 in a statement that the company released to @entity11			1
' i can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better			0
' and if we nail those , one store at a time , our short - term performance gets better			0
' the respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness , food quality , freshness and staff courtesy			1
@entity0 was joined by @entity54 ( rated number 66 ) and @entity57 's ( number 68 ) , which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed , according to @entity60			1
the annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts , which was cited by a quarter of respondents			2
other findings included : source : consumer reports @entity6 's favorite supermarket , taking first place , is @entity72 - based @entity71			2
the retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness , baked goods and overall shopping experience			0
@entity80 came in second place followed by @entity82 's , @entity83 and @entity84			1
@entity71 was also among a total of three grocers , including @entity87 and the @entity88 , that earned outstanding produce scores			0
' it 's going to sound clich√© , but our employees are our secret sauce , ' @entity91 , @entity71 ' vice president of media relations told @entity11			2
@entity91 also shed light on the fact that @entity71 is family - owned and not publicly traded , which ' allows us to take a long - range view , invest in people , and grow at a controlled rate			0
' while only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely satisfied with the quality of their store 's produce , meat and poultry offerings ; nationwide , @entity11 found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings			1
findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including @entity71 , @entity80 , @entity118 , @entity87 and @entity88 were considered standouts in this category			0
so as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $ 5,400 on food , what makes a supermarket the best ? the survey noted that those who were the ' freshest ' stores were usually the best overall			2
@entity71 ( file photo above ) was rated @entity6 's favorite supermarket followed by @entity80 , trader @entity82 and @entity83 in the past , check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers , but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy , unprocessed fruits , vegetables , meat and fish			1
they also want more organics and local produce			0
' there 's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods , especially among younger consumers , ' says @entity148 's @entity147			0
' they 're suspicious about food additives and so sure ' less is more , ' that they buy gluten - free even if they 're not allergic to gluten			0
