@entity1 's newest wildlife warrior is about to show the world how to dig out the most dangerous reptiles from backyards , beds and household bathrooms			1
former pastry chef @entity7 , 45 , is about to morph into @entity8 , a fearless snake charmer whose face - to - face encounters with @entity13 's most dangerous reptiles will be documented in a new television series			1
from encountering deadly eastern brown snakes inside children 's bedrooms to removing them off roofs , the 10 - part documentary series will follow her as she visits the homes of @entity23 residents to remove the unwanted slippery visitors			1
with cane toads , domestic pets and other feral animals on the menu , snakes are on the move and there 's only so many people qualified to catch and release them			1
that 's where @entity37 steps in			0
better known as @entity65 was born in @entity1 to @entity67 parents - and became a qualified reptile handler after years as a pastry chef			1
she split from her husband six years ago and quit her job to spend time doing things that brought her happiness			2
armed with a long hook , a bag and appropriate clothing ms @entity7 brings snakes from out of the dark and puts them back in to the wild it was after a trip to @entity34 in @entity83 , @entity13 where she began her new life			1
' i just fell in love , i felt so differently to everyone else getting a photo with the snakes , they all walked away saying ' yuck ! they feel so gross ' but i found them to be so beautiful and misunderstood			2
' she now spends her days removing eastern brown snakes from underneath concrete slabs and climbing roofs to check drains and down piping			0
but it 's her fear of heights , and not the threat of being bitten , which has her most worried when she attends to unwanted visitors inside homes			2
' it 's not the dangerous , venomous snakes i 'm afraid of catching , ' she said			2
' it 's climbing ladders and hopping on roofs to reef them out , particularly if you do n't know what snake you 're catching			2
' on one occasion she recalls coming face - to - face with a red belly black snake in shorts and thongs - a dress - code advised against when tackling one of @entity1 's most dangerous animals			2
during the adrenaline - pumping ordeal , she said she the home owners described a vastly different variety of snake to what she encountered			0
' i was told it was just a green tree snake , which are n't venomous			0
' ' but when i arrived wearing just shorts and thongs , it was in fact a red belly black snake curled up in the corner of a room			0
' filming for the show has begun and will be broadcast on @entity138 in 2016 apart from the actual handling of the animals themselves , the @entity26 series also hopes to educate people about misconceptions revolving around the reptile , in particular , that a ' good snake is a dead snake			1
' ' this is far from the truth , ' ms @entity7 said			0
' a good snake is a respected snake and if @entity1 did n't have snakes , we would be inundated with rats			0
' ' they 'd bring a lot of diseases with them			0
' ' people have to understand that we really need snakes and that if the snake is properly respected , there 's no need to be afraid of them			1
' program producer @entity164 said unlike the main star - some of @entity26 's crew members are a little reluctant to get too close to the scaly animals			1
' while i 'm very excited by the prospect of showcasing our fantastic characters and magnificent snakes to the world , i am completely and utterly snake phobic , ' she said			0
' you could say that the promo shoots we 've had so far , particularly the one with the brown snake in the baby 's bedroom , have been somewhat challenging for me and i am treating the upcoming shoots as aversion therapy			0
' the program will air on @entity138 across every region except @entity186 and the @entity187 when it starts in january 2016			1
@entity7 also discovered a love of motorcycles when her marriage broke down eastern brown snakes , red belly black snakes and pythons feature in the program			0

@entity197 quit her job as a pastry chef to become a snake handler
she is about to start filming a new television series called @entity26
the show will document her life catching snakes and other reptiles from homes in @entity13
the show will air in every region except the @entity187 and @entity186 on @entity138 from 2016
she hopes the 10 - part series will dispel people 's fears about snakes
' i find them to be so beautiful and misunderstood , ' she says
