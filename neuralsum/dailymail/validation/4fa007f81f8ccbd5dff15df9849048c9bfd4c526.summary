@entity0 could yet host @entity3 ’s glamour @entity2 quarter - final with @entity4 in july – if @entity5 opt to put atmosphere ahead of a desire to play on grass			1
@entity9 led the home team to victory over @entity12 in front of 7,500 passionate fans at the @entity15 on sunday and , with all three days sold out in a matter of minutes , there is an obvious desire to see @entity20 ’s greatest active sportsman in action again			1
@entity9 himself expressed a preference for facing the @entity4 on grass – but said : ‘ i think grass might be a good surface , but we ’ll have to see , because playing in front of a crowd like this also makes a difference and it helps			1
@entity9 celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over @entity33 on sunday @entity3 supporters would relish supporting @entity35 in @entity0 again in july all three day 's of @entity2 action at the @entity15 were sold out in a matter of minutes if we ca n’t guarantee that at a grass venue maybe it makes sense to play it somewhere we can get that			1
’ @entity5 captain @entity44 , a @entity45 himself , said there was ‘ no chance ’ of finding or creating a suitably large outdoor venue – a minimum of 600 seats are required – in order to bring a grass - court tie to @entity20			1
but he added : ‘ i say no chance but i ’m not a lawn expert			2
so , if someone can tell me there ’s a chance , i ’m sure we would explore it			0
@entity5 captain @entity44 doubts the chances of @entity0 being able to create a larger grass - court venue @entity44 embraces with @entity9 after the latter 's straight sets win secured @entity5 's quarter - final berth @entity9 ( middle ) is looked on in envy by his fellow @entity5 team - mates after securing a tie against @entity4 ' internally , we ’ve looked at other options , thinking outside the box			1
‘ the first thing i need to do , over the next week or two , is think about the best surface			0
@entity9 said grass there but we need to sit as a group , look at the likely @entity4 team and think about what ’s best			1
‘ then we have to go somewhere with a great atmosphere			2
if it ’s indoor hard , why not here – or somewhere near here ? something like this , it definitely worked in @entity20			0
' you have to look at when the tie lands in the summer , too			2
‘ there will have been an awful lot of tennis in certain regions , so you want to put it somewhere people have the hunger for more tennis			0
we ’ll be phoning around like mad			0
‘ ultimately you go with the surface that gives you the best chance of winning			0
the atmosphere is great – but it will be even better to be in the semi-finals			2
‘ we ’ve got to pick a surface that all the players agree on			0
we ’ll put our heads together over the next week , then go to the suits and ask them to make it happen			0

@entity3 face @entity4 in the @entity2 quarter finals in july
this tie could be held in @entity0 if @entity5 *decide* atmosphere *outweighs* the desire to play on a grass court
their 3 - 2 win over the @entity12 was played inside the @entity15
@entity9 *admits* his preference is grass , but that playing in @entity0 again with the crowd behind them could be *crucial*
@entity5 captain @entity44 doubts the prospects of creating a suitably large outdoor venue in order to have a grass court in @entity0
