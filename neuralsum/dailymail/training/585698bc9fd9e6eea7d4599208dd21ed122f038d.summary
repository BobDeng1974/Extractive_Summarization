by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 09:52 est , 17 december 2012 eccentric @entity2 striker @entity1 might be deadly in front of goal but he proved that he 's not quite so sharp with a pair of scissors and a roll of wrapping paper			1
in a hilarious two minute clip the apparently clueless @entity10 ace is shown how to wrap his @entity13 gifts by teammate @entity14			1
but the exasperated @entity15 becomes increasingly frustrated as @entity1 continually messes it up and blames being left handed for his failure			2
@entity1 , who will desperately need to work on his present wrapping skills after becoming a new father earlier this month , watches @entity14 as he wraps his present with consummate ease			2
speaking in @entity47 , @entity1 asks the 28 - year - old if he is going to wrap his presents as well			1
but despite a quick @entity14 tutorial , @entity1 is unable to master the skill			2
apparently giving up , he sighs : ' you know why , it 's because i am left handed			0
' when asked what the difference is by @entity14 , @entity1 replies : ' how can i do this if it 's this way around ? ' cheeky : the eccentric @entity2 star asks his teammate @entity14 if he can wrap his gifts for him , but @entity14 refuses ' @entity1 , use your head ' : @entity14 becomes increasingly frustrated as @entity1 fails to grasp what he is trying to teach him festive : the clip was filmed as part of @entity2 's video advent calendar and has been viewed by more than 600,000 people on @entity42 sticking to the day job : @entity1 , left , is useless at wrapping @entity13 presents despite a video tutorial from his teammate @entity14 , right frustrated forward @entity14 snaps : ' @entity1 , use your head a bit ! no wonder people say that you are daft			1
' @entity1 replies : ' i 'm not daft			1
look , it 's difficult			0
' clearly the former @entity80 star was really struggling , in the following days advent offering @entity14 's place at the wrapping table has been taken by @entity85 goalkeeper @entity84 , but @entity1 is still struggling with his gifts and asking for help			1
it 's likely that @entity1 's gift was n't intended for his current employer - it was revealed over the weekend that the forward is takingthe club to a tribunal to dispute a £ 34,000 fine for his poor discipline on the field			0
he has something of a reputation for being a little clumsy after famously setting his rented £ 3million @entity100 home alight in 2011 after letting off fireworks in the bathroom			0
other amusing advent offerings from @entity2 's cameramen include @entity106 star @entity105 singing a @entity107 in his native tongue , @entity109 giving a less than tuneful rendition of @entity111 and @entity112 trying his first ever mince pie on camera			0
@entity14 teaches @entity1 a lesson in gift wrapping			0

@entity1 fails *miserably* to wrap his gifts in hilarious @entity42 video
@entity121 tells teammate : ' no wonder people say that you are daft '
