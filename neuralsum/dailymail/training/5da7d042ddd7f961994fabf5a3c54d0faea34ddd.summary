by @entity0 a tunnel long enough to span the @entity2 could be built beneath some of @entity5 ’s most beautiful countryside following environmental concerns about a £ 1billion potash mine scheme			1
the ambitious engineering project would see a 22 - mile tunnel constructed up to 1,100ft under the @entity11 national park			1
the company behind the mine , @entity14 , wants to dig two mine shafts to a depth of 1,500 metres and extract the mineral polyhalite – a type of potash used as a fertiliser			1
countryside : the tunnel , 1,500 metres under ground , was designed in response to environmental concerns originally the company wanted to move the mineral in slurry form via a pipeline near the surface			1
but objectors were concerned that the pipeline would scar and damage the countryside			1
the proposed solution , which will be submitted to planning authorities later this year , would see the rock transported from the mine to a six metre - wide underground tunnel			2
it could then be transported on a conveyor belt from the mine near @entity41 to the processing plant – adding £ 170million to the cost of the scheme , but reducing its total footprint by 70 per cent			0
the tunnel would be as long as the section of @entity48 below the sea and its construction would bring more than a million cubic metres of rock to the surface – enough to fill @entity53			2
the firm in charge of the mine has claimed it would create up to 6,000 jobs , boost the economy by up to £ 1billion a year and provide the government with £ 300million annually in tax payments			0
picturesque : the view of the @entity11 more than 400 landowners are also keeping their fingers crossed that the tunnel wins over objectors in the green lobby			2
many of them are struggling farmers , but would become millionaires if the mineral is mined below their fields , as they stand to receive a share of the mine ’s total annual revenue			0
@entity77 , the chief executive of @entity14 , said : ‘ this would minimise our impact at the surface , removing the need for any construction in protected habitats			0
’ however @entity84 , from the @entity85 , said : ‘ the tunnel is absolutely enormous , there ’s no doubt about that			0
but we reserve judgment as to whether this new scheme will be any better than the last one			0

plans would see ambitious tunnel built under @entity11
company proposes to dig 1,100ft route to move polyhalite - a fertiliser
they originally planned a tunnel for mineral slurry near the surface
but objectors were concerned it would damage and scar the countryside
