mrs @entity80 30 , said : ' we 've had a great response from customers to the @entity24 toasty			1
' people use it as an ersatz @entity3 dinner , and just love the idea of a whole @entity3 dinner - in weight as well as in content - in a single toasty			0
' the most common response is a widening of the eyes as we put it together and they realise how much they have let themselves in for			0
' but invariably they come back after and tell us it was amazing			0

customers who want their toasties sans sprouts have to make a £ 1 donation to charity ( right ) ' we thought we would at least give people an incentive to try it , seeing as they actually really work			0
' although we have had donations where people have left the sprouts in , only one person has paid to take them out , which perhaps suggest people like sprouts more than we thought			0
' we only raised a few pounds for charity , but i guess every little helps			0
