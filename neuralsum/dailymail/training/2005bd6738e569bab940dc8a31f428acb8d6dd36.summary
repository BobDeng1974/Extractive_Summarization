now she need only switch on her computer			0
dementia sufferer @entity6 , 78 , has been fitted with a tracking device nicknamed a ‘ @entity9 ’ because she gets lost so often when out walking			1
if she wanders too far from her bungalow in @entity22 , or suffers a fall , her daughter receives a phone call from the @entity26 team			1
mrs @entity1 said the device , supplied by @entity29 ’s assisted technology department , had enabled the great - grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be put in a home			1
‘ the police once brought her home when she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway			2
she does n’t think there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost			2
ms @entity1 says that the device has allowed her mother to avoid having to move into a nursing home before they had the device , ms @entity1 says she would have to go out looking for her mother up to five times a day the black box is attached to mrs @entity6 's keys and , as well as tracking her location , it can alert her daughter if she falls over or strays outside a certain area ‘ one day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search			1
we live near the moors and i was sick with worry			0
’ mrs @entity1 says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives			2
‘ there are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about @entity16			0
’ before she had the tracking device , mrs @entity6 ( left ) was found by police on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway ‘ we live near the moors and i was sick with worry , i ca n't put into words how i felt , i was really worked up and just kept crying , i thought the worse			1
she would even try and go out in the snow , ’ she said			0
following this incident , a desperate ms @entity1 began researching ways to track her mother - in particular she was looking for a mobile phone with a tracking app - and she came across @entity73			2
ms @entity1 said the system worked ‘ in the nick of time ’			1
she explained : ‘ my mother ’s independence is key to her and i think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings			1
‘ but you have got to be safe at the same time			2
i know my mum would hate being in a home and i believe she would have deteriorated			0
if she did n't have this it would be really dangerous			0
’ she added : ‘ i ca n't fault @entity16			0
if she did n't have this then she would not be in her own house but in a home there is no doubt about it			0
