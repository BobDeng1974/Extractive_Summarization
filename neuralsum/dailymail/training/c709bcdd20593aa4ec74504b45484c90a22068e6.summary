original dove ad campaign features an @entity2 - trained forensic artist who sketches women , while the spoof video targets men the women in the @entity8 campaign focused on flaws , but the men in the spoof video describe themselves as movie star handsome by @entity12 published : 11:18 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 22 april 2013 the @entity8 ad campaign that shows women being sketched by a forensic artist has racked up over 18 million @entity17 views so far			1
now a spoof video by @entity19 with the tagline ' men : you 're @entity23 ' is also becoming an internet sensation			1
@entity8 's @entity26 campaign hired an @entity2 forensic artist to sketch women based on their own descriptions of themselves - without ever seeing them - then create a second drawing based on stranger 's description			1
while the women in the original video focused on their flaws when describing themselves to the sketch artist , the men view themselves as movie star handsome			1
the spoof video re-creates the original almost frame - by - frame , using a bearded ' forensic artist ' , a very similar loft studio and even the same music			1
like the women , the men explain that they showed up in a strange location and a man started drawing them			2
self confident : the men focused on their positive features , while the women they were told to get close to seemed to see many more flaws altered images : one man sees @entity68 ( left ) when he looks in the mirror , but strangers saw someone who looked very different ( right ) once the portraits were hung side - by - side , the women in the original ad were shocked to see that the sketches created on the stranger 's description of them were much more attractive			1
for the men , it was exactly the opposite			2
they see the positives like ' beautiful teeth '			0
' people say that they 're an abyss because they just do n't end , ' one man says of his eyes , while another believes that ' the older i 've gotten the more stunning i 've gotten			0
' spot the difference : one man ( left ) is shocked when he sees the difference in his description ( center ) of himself and a stranger 's view ( right ) asked to name his ' most prominent feature ' , yet another man proudly lists ' my bulge '			0
the men were told to chat with female strangers - who had a very different view			2
' overall i would say that he really looked like lawn gnome , ' one woman said , while another admitted ' he looked like he smelled really bad , and he did			0
' the men loved their eyes , but the women were less complimentary			2
one said ' his eyes kind of bugged out when he talked , ' another called the guy 's eyes ' rapey ' and a third explained ' i ca n't remember if he had eyebrows			0
' to sum up , the final female questioned compared her match to a @entity121 character , saying he looked like he walked ' fresh out of @entity123 '			0
during the portrait reveal , the women in the original ad were shocked to discover how much more beautiful they appeared to strangers - one even teared up in happiness			1
the men were crying for different reasons			0
after being shown a side - by - side of his @entity133 - look - alike with a bloated , nerdy profile , one man said ' he looks like a movie star , and the other one looks like he 'll probably die soon			1
' ' i did n't realize that two opinions could be so vastly different , ' said a guy who described himself as @entity68 , after discovering that the girls saw the @entity141			0
' that is not me , ' said the man at the end , ' and i refuse to believe it			0
