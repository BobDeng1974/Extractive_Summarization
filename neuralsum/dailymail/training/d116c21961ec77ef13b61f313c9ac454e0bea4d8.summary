his eyes light up when he talks of the time @entity2 threw him into the @entity5 deep end as a raw fast bowler barely out of club cricket			1
‘ my first @entity5 in @entity10 stands out , ’ said @entity8 , who stepped up from @entity9 to the big time 12 years ago			1
‘ it was the first time my family had seen me play for @entity2 and it meant a lot for them to be there			2
‘ there was also the @entity18 situation where we were effectively knocked out because we did n’t go there			0
’ @entity8 hopes the upcoming @entity5 is n't his last			1
pictured by @entity24 snapper @entity22 @entity8 can go past @entity2 's test wicket haul held by sir @entity26 ( pictured above at @entity27 ) @entity2 refused to travel to @entity28 because of safety concerns and @entity18 were awarded all four @entity5 points			1
then a two - wicket defeat by @entity32 , when @entity33 hammered @entity8 , made it impossible for @entity2 to progress			1
‘ it was an eventful time and , even though i felt i then lost us that game against @entity32 in @entity39 , when @entity40 put faith in me , the fact he brought me on at a critical time gave me confidence that i could perform at that level			2
’ then there was his first @entity5 as a fan			2
‘ something we should look at as a team now is the 1992 @entity5 because that was in @entity32 and @entity51 too			1
we did n’t have @entity52 so i went round my dad ’s mate ’s house to watch it in the early hours			0
‘ i know it ’s a while ago but people still talk about it as a great @entity5 for @entity2 and we know we ’ll get big support in @entity32			1
it could be an exciting time and we can draw on the history of what happened then			0
’ @entity2 finished runners - up in 1992 , losing to @entity65 ’s @entity64 in the @entity67 final			1
@entity26 in action during the @entity69			2
@entity2 reached the final of the tournament but @entity72 were beaten by @entity65 ( pictured ) and his @entity64 team in the @entity67 showpiece there is no doubting @entity8 ’s enthusiasm			1
the man who stands on the brink of his 100th test and sir @entity26 ’s wicket - taking record is fit , raring to go , and keen to point out that limited - overs matches mean just as much to him as the ultimate game			1
‘ one - day cricket is really significant for me , ’ said @entity8 as he prepares to go to @entity32 for the triangular series that precedes the @entity5			1
‘ i made my @entity2 debut in one - day cricket and i ’ve always enjoyed that form			1
i ’ve still got a drive to play one - day cricket so until that stops i will carry on			1
my record in 50 - over games is probably better than @entity92 if you look at the stats			2
it will be great to have these months of one - day cricket			1
’ but surely this is his last chance to make a real impact in a @entity5 ? the premier one - day tournament is usually a watershed			1
@entity100 has gone and it looks certain @entity2 will rip up their one - day blueprint and start again after this @entity5 with younger , more dynamic players			1
@entity8 appeals in @entity2 's @entity106 clash against @entity107 during the @entity108 the @entity2 bowler dives for the ball during @entity2 's 2011 campaign - he was jaded after his @entity112 heroics @entity8 jumps for joy after dismissing sir @entity107 's @entity115 at @entity117 in may ‘ i do n’t want to say this is my last @entity5 , ’ @entity8 insisted			1
‘ it ’s probably unlikely i ’ll play in the next one because i ’ll be 36 by then but it ’s not impossible			0
i want to concentrate on this one first			0
’ @entity2 will need him at his best			2
as @entity40 identified in these pages after the series defeat in @entity107 , @entity2 ’s bowling is an even bigger one - day problem than the batting , which is often too cautious			1
@entity8 , who sat out @entity107 to provide rest for his battle - scarred body , and @entity129 , who returns after knee surgery , are crucial figures if @entity2 are to take @entity5 wickets and restrict the big hitters			1
‘ we ’ve identified the last 15 overs of innings as an area where we can get better , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ i see myself bowling in that stage of a game and it ’s something we ’ll look at			0
i do n’t necessarily think it needs new skills and at this stage of my career i ’ve got enough up my sleeve to perform well			0
it ’s partly execution of each delivery and you ’ve got to be able to hit the right area with every ball			0
‘ you have to pick the right moment to bowl the right ball and stay one step ahead of the batter			0
with only four men outside the circle it ’s crucial we get our fields right			0
you see people sometimes changing every ball but you have to be clinical			0
you have to have options rather than trying to sort it out on the field			0
’ @entity2 will be rank outsiders in the triangular series against @entity32 and @entity166 and then the @entity5			1
‘ everywhere you look people have been saying we have n’t got a chance but , not only does that make you more determined , it means you can pass under the radar , ’ said @entity8			2
@entity8 is pictured celebrating @entity173 's wicket in the first @entity174 back in 2013 2003 : produces an inspired four - wicket burst to skittle @entity64 in @entity175 , but is then smashed out of the ground by @entity33 in @entity39 as @entity32 pip @entity2 in a nerve - shredder			1
2007 : put to the sword by @entity10 ’s @entity179 and a @entity180 as @entity2 limp out at the @entity106 stage in the @entity182			2
2011 : produces some brilliant bowling as @entity2 beat @entity10 , but is shattered after his @entity112 heroics @entity186 and is n’t in the team as @entity2 are hammered by @entity107 in the quarter - final			2
they will attempt to exceed expectations under new leadership after @entity8 ’s friend @entity100 was replaced by @entity193			1
‘ i feel sorry for @entity194 because he ’s done so much behind the scenes and he ’s got a real vision of where he wants the team to go , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ but his form in the last 12 to 18 months has n’t been near the standard it needs to be to stay in and he will admit that			0
’ whatever happens in the @entity5 , @entity8 has a big date in @entity205 in april , where he is due to appear in his 100th test and can celebrate it with the four wickets he needs to exceed @entity26 ’s tally of 383			1
‘ i ’m not thinking about the record , ’ he said			0
‘ one - day cricket is at the forefront of my mind			1
the last thing i want to be thinking is that i could get those wickets in my 100th test in @entity205			1
i ’d love to pass the record but i do n’t want to tempt fate			0
’ and , however long @entity8 has left in both test and one - day cricket , he will not be changing the aggressive style that landed him in hot water last summer for a clash with @entity223 at @entity224			1
the bowler was cleared on the @entity227 disciplinary charge that could have seen him banned but his penchant for sledging , which contrasts with his mild - mannered off - field demeanour , remains under scrutiny			2
@entity8 will not be changing the aggressive style that landed him in hot water last summer for a clash with @entity223 at @entity224 ( pictured ) ‘ my attitude is something i ’ve worked on with a psychologist over the last few years to get the best out of me as a bowler and that means being aggressive , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ the umpires are on the field to marshal what ’s going on and if they feel someone oversteps the mark they report it to the match referee			0
nothing was reported in that game or the series			0
but it is something i ’m conscious of			0
‘ we know there are kids watching and we have to try to find a balance between winning and being a role model			0
i ’m well aware of it but i think the aggression is something i ’ve channelled well in recent years			0
my career took off in 2008 and that was the start of getting it right and being consistent on the @entity261 ’s always been part of the game			0
‘ as a kid playing club cricket i would be sledged by 40 - year - old blokes			0
i saw it growing up on tv — the @entity268 doing it to @entity2			0
i never want to cross the line where it goes too far			0
i ’ll continue to be aggressive but i ’m very aware of the laws and spirit of the game			0
that aggression has helped me take wickets and i ’ll try to keep channelling it in the right way			0
’ it is a method that has served @entity2 well and will need to do so again if they are to have any chance of upsetting the odds in @entity32			1

@entity8 hopes @entity5 in @entity32 and @entity51 is not his last
@entity2 bowler will appear in his 100th test later this year in @entity205
he is also closing in on sir @entity26 's wicket - taking record for @entity2
@entity8 *reveals* he feels sorry for axed one - day *captain* @entity100
