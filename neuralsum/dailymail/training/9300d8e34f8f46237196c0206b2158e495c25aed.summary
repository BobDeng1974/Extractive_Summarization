by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 8 january 2013 the body of a county commissioner was found floating in a marina one mile from his home on an island off the coast of @entity8 , with his hands bound and a gunshot to his head			1
police originally ruled the case a homicide but as the search for @entity19 's killer has now been going on for nearly one month , the prospect of it being a fully - staged suicide is now being seriously considered			1
though many aspects of the case - like the way his body was ditched , the fact the autopsy said he drowned rather than dying from the gunshot wound in his head , and the bloodstains in the trunk of his abandoned car - point to murder , many who knew @entity19 say that they have no idea who would have wanted him dead			1
he went missing on the night of monday december 11 , following his regular poker game at a friend 's house in a town called @entity54 , about a half hour drive from @entity56			1
his wife became concerned when he had n't arrived home by 2.30am and she called the friends that her husband had been playing cards with earlier in the evening			2
one of the men drove along the route that mr @entity19 typically takes home from the games and he discovered the abandoned car at 4am			1
two hours later , another friend that was helping in the search checked the docks of the @entity71			0
there he found @entity19 's barely - visible body floating in the water			1
timeline : after leaving his poker game in @entity54 , the drive should have only taken about 30 minutes to get back to his home on @entity56 but he never returned the marina is nearly one mile away from mr @entity19 's home , which real estate site @entity81 values at $ 998,241			1
police chief @entity83 told the @entity84 that they have not found anyone who has seen @entity19 in between 10.30pm monday night when he left the poker game and the time that his friend found his body in the early morning on tuesday			1
several key pieces of information have not been released by police			0
they say that several personal items were missing from mr @entity19 's car but they have not disclosed what those items were			2
one thing they have ruled out is his wallet , however , as mr @entity83 said that he was the one to collect that at the scene			0
transfers : @entity19 ( center right ) - seen here with his daughter in law @entity109 ( left ) , son @entity47 ( center left ) , and younger son @entity46 ( right ) - was originally from @entity111 but moved to @entity56 in @entity8 in the 1990s unexpected : the 52 - year - old grandfather - seen here with @entity43 ( left ) , @entity109 ( center right ) and @entity47 ( right ) - had no known enemies , making the search for any possible suspects more difficult friends and colleagues are shocked that anyone would want to murder the mild - mannered realtor - turned - local official , adding to speculation that perhaps it was suicide			1
because of that possibility - which other friends dismiss out of hand , saying that there were no signs that mr @entity19 was depressed or had any intention of killing himself - people are curious about the angle of the shot			1
work : mr @entity19 was resigning as a county commissioner in the coming months to spend more time working on his real estate business if mr @entity19 shot himself while his hands were bound , the bullet would have likely come from the bottom of his head , closer to his chin , as opposed to if he was shot by someone standing perhaps above him			1
another problem for police : they still have n't found the gun			0
' you name it ... there are all sorts of theories , ' local resident @entity144 told the @entity150			0
as the search for a suspect is about to be one month old , investigators are beginning to look more closely at signs that the death could have been staged			1
one of the things they are revealing to have found in the abandoned car was an empty bottles of prescription medication that belonged to mr @entity19 and his wife			2
they are still waiting on toxicology reports to determine whether or not mr @entity19 had ingested any of the pills , as a suicide would be more likely if he had taken some of those drugs before killing himself			2
the obvious signs prompted police to rule the case a homicide immediately after mr @entity19 was found			2
that has produced few leads , however , as no friends can suggest no possible enemies for mr @entity176 who they called a ' jokester '			0
his wife @entity38 has not spoken publicly since the incident and neither have his four children - his daughters @entity109 and @entity43 and sons @entity46 and @entity47			0
he is also survived by two grandchildren			0
he is also known for being honest and willing to compromise when it came to his work			0
the @entity187 chairman @entity186 said to the @entity84 that mr @entity19 ' was probably one of the greatest community leaders i can recall ' and also counted him as a ' good friend and a great family man '			2
the only contested decision that investigators have looked into from his time as commissioner was one to fight a proposed jail expansion			2
mr @entity19 was against the idea of building a new jail in @entity199 , which is just on the mainland and not far from @entity56 , and though the debate was heated according to the @entity150 , his side did win in the end and the jail was built elsewhere			1
as the case is still officially ruled a homicide , some of mr @entity19 's colleagues fear that they may be next			0
' all the commissioners have had a second thought about this thing , ' fellow commissioner @entity209 told the @entity150			0
' i try not to get myself backed up in a corner somewhere			0
i avoid dark parking lots			0
when i walk outside my business , i look both ways			0

county commissioner @entity19 , 52 , was found dead floating in a marina near his home in @entity56 off the coast of @entity8
his hands were bound together and he was shot in the head but autopsy revealed his cause of death was drowning
last seen at weekly card game with friends on monday december 11 and his dead body was found seven hours later
speculation about possibility of staged suicide as investigators have not found any clues about potential murder suspects
