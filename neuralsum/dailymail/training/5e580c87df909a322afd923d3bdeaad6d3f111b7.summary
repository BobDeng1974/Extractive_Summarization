' the current system is discredited ' : @entity2 orders inquiry into cheating row as teachers are ' coached by examiners ' the heads of the country ’s exam boards are being hauled before mps in a bid to restore public confidence in gcses and a-levels , it was revealed yesterday			1
the @entity16 ’ education select committee has called an emergency session in the wake of the scandal over school teachers being ‘ coached ’ by examiners in how to improve their pupils ’ pass marks			0
education secretary @entity2 hopes to de-commercialise the exam system so that each subject is tested by one board only – so rival boards would not be driven to offer tests that are easier than their competitors ’ to try to win business from schools			1
mr @entity2 said : ' i think one of the things about the @entity36 investigation is that it draws attention to the worst examples of a culture which has worked against excellence , which has been grotesquely unfair to students , because it means that their time has been taken up learning exam technique and not subjects			1
' @entity46 , on behalf of @entity47 , and @entity48 , chief executive of the @entity50 board @entity49 , will appear before the select committee on thursday , alongside @entity52 , chief executive of @entity54 , and @entity55 , chief executive of @entity56			0
the exams regulator , @entity58 , and representatives from the @entity36 have also been invited to give evidence			0
an undercover investigation by the newspaper exposed how teachers pay up to £ 230 a day to attend seminars with chief examiners , during which they have been advised on exam questions and the wording pupils should use to get higher marks			1
two examiners have been suspended from @entity49 , after being filmed giving detailed guidance on forthcoming @entity73 history exams			0
another examiner was suspended from @entity47 after being recorded claiming the course content in her board ’s geography gcse was so small she did not know how it had been passed by the regulator			0
the select committee is already investigating the country ’s exam system			1
it now wants urgent answers from the exam bosses over the ‘ shocking ’ evidence unearthed			1
@entity88 , chairman of the select committee , said : ‘ one of the areas we ’re already looking at is conflicts of interest – the commercial exploitation of their position as awarding bodies and whether the way the examination system is structured incentivises the right behaviour in awarding bodies			1
‘ this … tends to suggest the pressures and competition within the system are driving them to behaviour that is not in the best interests of good standards of education			1
’ @entity110 was filmed apparently telling teachers they could ignore some parts of the syllabus as they would n't appear in the exams he added : ‘ the whole session will be on the evidence unearthed and the questions arising from that			0
‘ it will be about how we can have confidence in the system if the very people who are providing the awards appear to be complicit in gaining an encouragement of an approach which is n’t truly educational			2
we are already conducting an inquiry into exam boards and the need for reform			2
‘ the stories are shocking and suggest there may be a need for radical changes			0
the committee will question the heads of the exam boards to hold them publicly to account			2
we will also want to ask the regulator how such alleged breaches have been allowed to happen and explore what can be done to ensure that our qualifications support and encourage real learning rather than undermine it			0
’ former senior examiner @entity144 , who worked for @entity47 , told the committee last week that he wanted to see a single merged exam board because ‘ it was wrong to put children ’s qualifications into the marketplace ’			2
mr @entity144 , who was an a-level history examiner between 1996 and 2011 , told mps : ‘ one of the reasons why grades have gone up and up is the issue of market share			0
‘ exam boards are very wary of saying , “ this year there have been fewer a grades ”			2
‘ what the exam boards are worried about is that if they hit children hard one year and the number of top grades diminish they fear people will go elsewhere			2
’ mr @entity2 has ordered an official inquiry into the scandal and the regulator , @entity58 , must report back before @entity170			1
chief executive @entity171 has outlined a number of possible sanctions including pulling ‘ examinations set for january and for next summer with awarding bodies providing substitute scripts ’			0
the @entity178 said he is preparing to reform the exam system early in the new year , but is awaiting the findings of the investigation before finalising his proposals			1
his current plans would see exam boards compete to provide a single exam for each subject			1
' the first response that most people understandably have is , ' why do n't you just have one exam board ? ' mr @entity2 told the @entity36			1
‘ as someone who grew up in @entity192 i naturally sympathise , because we just had one exam board			2
i think it is the most compelling answer at the moment			0
but i owe it to students and to teachers to let the investigators come up with their recommendations			0
and present all the facts			0
