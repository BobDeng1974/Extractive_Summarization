losing one striker looks unavoidable but the prospect of @entity3 ’s understudy also leaving @entity4 is a headache @entity6 could do without			1
a season that began with a pair of impressive leading men could stutter if @entity11 ’ representatives move beyond talking in their courtship of other clubs			2
the striker revealed on friday that ‘ my agent has been speaking to one very big club ’ and ‘ it is nice to hear ’ of outside interest , with @entity19 especially keen on the 29 - year - old			1
@entity11 played a key role in @entity4 ’s equaliser on saturday but those comments will have concerned @entity24 after @entity25 on sunday agreed the £ 30million transfer fee for @entity3			1
@entity11 leaped above @entity28 's defence to score @entity30 's equaliser in the 74th minute @entity11 celebrates by displaying a @entity32 flag to commemorate the innocent people who tragically died in the @entity35 terrorist attack @entity4 striker @entity3 will seal a £ 30 million transfer to @entity25 later this month the 29 - year - old impressed for the @entity37 during their 1 - 1 draw against @entity28 @entity39 has been involved in 11 goals this season after his role in @entity44 ’s opener			1
that is as many as he managed in the previous three seasons combined			0
@entity11 only arrived six months ago on a @entity47 from @entity48 , but @entity24 , for his part , is not worried about a potential striker crisis , especially as @entity4 ’s attention has already turned to @entity53 ’s @entity52			2
‘ i am not bothered about quotes , ’ said @entity6 , whose side claimed a point thanks to @entity57 ’s 74th - minute own goal which cancelled out @entity44 ’s first - half opener			0
‘ i am only bothered about what people do for @entity4			0
he has looked sharp , he has looked bright and you can see there is desire and a work ethic			0
‘ he is my no 1 striker			2
even if @entity3 stays , this is @entity68 ’s chance to stake a claim for that shirt and if he does well enough he will keep it			0

@entity11 was on target as @entity4 drew 1 - 1 at home to @entity28
the 29 - year - old has been *linked* with a move away from the @entity37
that would spell *disaster* for @entity6 who is already set to lose his star striker @entity3 to @entity25
@entity11 *confirmed* that his agent has been speaking with ' one very big club ' , with @entity19 also interested in the @entity32 *forward*
however , @entity24 is not interested in talking about speculation and *insists* that @entity11 is his no 1 striker at the club
