@entity0 has been truly outstanding for @entity1 and @entity2 will know they are getting a top - quality player			1
his £ 30million move to the @entity6 looks like it will be completed soon			1
city are getting a brilliant striker to add to their already top - notch resources			2
here , @entity10 assesses @entity0 's strengths ... @entity2 look set to sign @entity0 after opening talks with @entity1 over a £ 30million deal bony fires in a goal against @entity16 for @entity1 at @entity17 on @entity18 @entity0 was pictured at the airport on wednesday as he headed for the @entity20 he was pictured with his agent ( right ) as he prepared to head out and represent the @entity22 the perfect blend of power and pace when @entity0 is on the move , defenders simply bounce off him			1
he is so powerful and direct that he just swats opponents aside			0
he embarrasses defenders because they ca n’t lay a glove on him			0
but there is great touch and skill to go with that immense strength			0
he is good on the ball and his ability to launch off his left or right foot is similar to @entity39			2
he explodes past players in the same way			0
@entity0 is so good at shifting his bodyweight and that makes it hard for defenders to read him and deal with him - once he ’s past you , there is no catching him			1
he also likes to stay central and as high up the pitch as he can so that when he runs off the shoulder of a defender , he can minimise the number of touches he needs before he can get a shot in			0
and when he does get a shot away , he has fantastic composure in front of goal			0
a man who loves to use his head at six foot , @entity0 is no slouch , but he loves competing in the air			1
for somebody who ’s so good on the ball , that is quite unusual			0
he really enjoys getting on the end of crosses and has said in the past he only needs one from his team - mates to score			2
he has n’t scored a header so far this season but he might fare better at @entity2			2
@entity0 plays in a similar way to @entity39 - he can be a great replacement or a brilliant partner the @entity22 forward loves to use his head as well , demonstrated against @entity16 on @entity18 @entity1 ’s crossing accuracy in 2014 - 15 is the second worst in the league , whereas @entity1 's is the fourth best			1
if they can feed @entity0 regularly then he is bound to keep scoring			2
he ’s quite similar to @entity78 when it comes to heading - neither are huge but they beat opponents to the ball out of sheer desire			0
he wants to be first to it every time and uses his power well to make sure he is			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity1 against @entity16 during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity17 on @entity18 not just a selfish striker @entity0 's primary function is to score goals , but he is excellent at bringing others into the game			1
if he comes deep his first thought is to see which of his team - mates is in the most dangerous position and he will try to find them			0
he ’s got quick , nimble feet , so he is able to pull off great bits of skill and he has a good awareness of how play is developing around him			0
he plays with real imagination and moving to @entity1 to play with the likes of @entity39 and @entity103 will only improve that			1
@entity0 and his team - mates celebrate his goal at @entity107 against @entity108 , who opted against signing the striker he has interested a number of clubs having scored the most @entity114 goals in the calendar year experience tells @entity0 is 26 but @entity1 are getting a player at the peak of his powers			1
it is a dream move so credit to him for working hard for years in the @entity122 and @entity123 to progress			0
that time has served him well but @entity1 also deserve credit for giving him a chance to shine where others ignored him			2
the competition at @entity1 will be tough , but he has already seen what it ’s like not to play in every game - he was rotated by @entity132 over @entity133 almost as preparation to see how @entity1 would cope without him			1
@entity0 , pictured climbing above the @entity137 defence in march , says he always tries to be in the right place the @entity22 scores past @entity2 goalkeeper @entity140 in november as @entity1 lost 2 - 1 at the @entity6			1

@entity0 is close to moving to @entity2 for £ 30million
@entity1 striker is a *powerhouse* who bounces off defenders
he moves like @entity39 and can be an ideal stand - in for @entity150
@entity0 could also form a magnificent partnership with @entity39 for @entity1
the @entity22 is *extremely* *intelligent* and loves to score headers
read : @entity0 will bring mental and *physical* strength to @entity2
