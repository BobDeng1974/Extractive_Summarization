by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 8 april 2013 the @entity1 is offering @entity3 screening to all @entity5 patients having a blood test a @entity8 hospital is offering @entity3 screening to everyone who has a blood test in an attempt to diagnose the 25 per cent of people unaware they have the virus			1
throughout april , the @entity1 , in @entity15 , is offering everyone having a blood test taken in @entity5 routine hiv screening			1
the scheme has been deemed necessary in an attempt to ' diagnose the undiagnosed ' because these people cause an estimated 75 per cent of new cases			2
usually a patient or doctor must specifically request an @entity3 test if it is deemed necessary			1
‘ @entity3 can be symptomless for a long time , ’ said dr @entity26 , the @entity27 behind the routine testing plan			2
‘ that means it 's very easy for people not to be diagnosed until it 's too late for today 's life - saving treatments to have their best effect			2
' people are still dying of @entity3 in the @entity37 - but only because they test too late			1
’ the pilot comes after research found people who were diagnosed late accounted for nearly a third of all @entity43 deaths last year			2
straight men are the least likely to be tested , said dr @entity45 , from the @entity46 at @entity47 and @entity48			0
dr @entity45 , consultant physician in @entity3 at the hospital and an honorary lecturer at @entity52 , said : ' those who do n't know they are infected are responsible for between 50 and 75 per cent of new infections			1
that is a hugely disproportional number of people passing on @entity3			1
' it is not likely cancer , where people who have it are seen as blameless			2
there is still a lot of stigma particularly among heterosexual men , and women			0
' this group do not think they are at risk , so are more likely to present later , but if you have sex without protection you should have a test			0
the scheme has been deemed necessary as 25 per cent of @entity3 positive people in the @entity37 are unaware that they are infected ' we need another big campaign because there is a lack of knowledge			1
people remember those scary ads from the 80s with the tombstone			0
that was right for the time , but things have moved on			0
@entity43 is not a death sentence , or indeed is it anything to be ashamed of			0
' with new treatments and technologies , there is only around a five or ten year difference in life expectancy			0
people with @entity3 go to work , they have children , they lead very normal lives			1
' despite this , other recent research found that between 1990 and 2010 , cases of hiv infection rose by 76 per cent due to fewer people using condoms			0
experts believe that the fall in condom use has been causes by the development of antiretroviral drugs which have reduced the levels of fear associated with the disease			0
dr @entity114 , hiv specialist at @entity116 and medical director of @entity118 , an @entity3 awareness charity , said : ‘ one of the things our campaigns help do is correct some commonly - held out - dated myths that perpetuate this stigma which make the lives of people living with @entity3 very difficult			1
‘ getting tested , looking after your sexual health , education and prevention are what it ’s all about			0
‘ if people have taken risks and by that i simply mean having unprotected sex , then there is every reason to get tested - it could save your life			0
’ the screening programme is being part - organised by @entity3 awareness charity saving lives , which is running a campaign called the @entity142			1
the initiative aims to use well - known sports personalities to educate people about the importance of hiv testing			0
the campaign , which is being organised by @entity148 and @entity3 charity @entity118 , is being piloted in @entity15 because the area is thought to have an @entity3 population five times the size of the national average – in @entity15 six in every 1,000 people are believed to be @entity3 positive .			1

the @entity1 in @entity15 is offering @entity3 screening to all patients having blood tests
