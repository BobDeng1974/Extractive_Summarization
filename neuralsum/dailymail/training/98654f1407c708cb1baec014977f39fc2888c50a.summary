the 29 - year - old , a 25 - time tour stage winner , suffered a separated @entity10 joint after colliding with @entity12 @entity11 ( @entity13 ) as @entity15 's @entity14 won the stage and with it the yellow jersey			1
it is the first time since 2008 - when he left prematurely to prepare for the @entity20 - that @entity3 will not complete the @entity21			2
@entity3 's absence reduces the @entity51 contingent in the race to just three - defending champion @entity50 , his @entity86 team - mate @entity85 , and @entity13 's @entity87 - as they embarked on the 201km route from @entity2 to @entity89			1
the stage was due to take the riders back into the hills , and those riders who have examined the route in the build up to the @entity21 have been surprised by the challenges it holds in store			2
lead out : @entity100 's @entity99 ( left ) wearing the best young 's white jersey , @entity59 's @entity14 ( second left ) wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey , @entity105 's @entity104 ( second right ) wearing the best sprinter 's green jersey , and @entity59 's @entity60 ( right ) wearing the best climber 's polka dot jersey , ride out of @entity53 tightly bunched : the peloton ride down @entity111 in @entity2 during the ceremonial opening to the second stage what a view ! the @entity1 general director @entity115 ( right ) and welcome to @entity49 chief executive @entity116 hitch a lift ahead of the riders flying the flag : crowds gather at @entity121 in @entity2 in anticipation of the riders coming past there are a total of nine categorised climbs , including the category two @entity127 incline and , five kilometres from the finish , the short sharp rise of @entity131 in @entity89 , which has a gradient reaching 33 per cent			1
@entity134 's @entity60 , at 42 the oldest man in the race , was wearing the @entity138 ' polka dot jersey as the second stage began after his solo break over @entity141 a day earlier			2
huge crowds were once again expected after a glorious day on saturday saw an estimated two million people line the roads of the @entity145			0
@entity146 : spectators line the balconies at @entity53 ahead of the start capture the moment : fans attempt to get a good shot of the riders as they pass by @entity154 played : this woman came prepared for the long wait for the riders to reach @entity127 in the @entity157 record breaker : @entity159 , the co-founder of the @entity161 brewing company puts the finishing touches to his attempt at the record for the world 's largest glass of beer			1
the glass holds 3,664 pints of @entity170 's gold ale , one pint for every kilometer of the @entity21 spicy : a group of fans dressed in @entity175 garb wait for the arrival of the cyclists spotty : some people in @entity179 were truly in the spirit of the occasion , painting polka dots on their house a breakaway went up the road as soon as the racing began for real , with @entity187 ( @entity188 ) , @entity189 ( @entity134 ) , @entity190 ( @entity191 ) , @entity192 ( @entity193 ) , @entity194 ( @entity195 ) and @entity196 ( @entity197 ) moving clear before @entity198 ( @entity199 ) managed to latch on			0
their lead was more than three minutes as they began the ascent of the first categorised climb over @entity205 , and it was @entity190 who crossed the summit first to take the points			0
behind , there was drama for @entity212 as the yellow jersey took a tumble trying to get back to the peloton after answering nature 's call , but the @entity59 was able to regroup without drama			2
@entity187 led the breakaway over @entity220 with @entity190 just behind , but it was the @entity191 man who was first over the next two climbs , @entity223 and @entity224 , to take the virtual lead in the @entity138 competition			0
stunning : a view over @entity127 as spectators await the arrival of the riders party time : spectators in fancy dress form a conga line in the @entity236 village of @entity237 man in the mask : a fan with a @entity3 mask is given a lift while three cheering @entity243 look on the peloton had caught back up ahead of the main climb of the day , @entity127 , the category two climb , but @entity197 's @entity196 broke off the front at the foot of the hill before @entity188 veteran @entity251 launched one his trademark attacks in pursuit			1
@entity196 however was too strong for the @entity105 , who ended up third over the top as @entity255 ( @entity191 ) came through			0
with the roads narrowed by yet more huge crowds , @entity86 took control of the front of the peloton to keep @entity50 safe			0
@entity14 was suffering again behind , dropped by the peloton and then forced to stop due to puncture .			0
