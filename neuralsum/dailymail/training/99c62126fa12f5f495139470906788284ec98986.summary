@entity1 users are finding the long - awaited @entity2 8 update likes to jump the gun when it comes to shooting selfies			2
the company released the update to the mobile operating system last week with an overhauled @entity11 app that many were simply not ready for			1
a reporter for @entity14 was led astray by what she thought was a shortcut for taking a carefully posed selfie to send over @entity18			0
clicking on the photo button , it turns out , snaps a photo and sends it out immediately without the option of editing it			1
so with no time to get the lighting right or edit the photo just so , you could become a victim of the accidental selfie			2
the new @entity43 update has already faced criticism			0
co-founder and ceo of messaging app @entity45 snarked ' very flattering to see @entity1 " borrow " numerous @entity45 features into @entity18 in @entity43 # innovation ' on @entity50 back in june			0
rash : frustrated users took to social media to share their dissatisfaction and their awkward selfies caused by a poor rollout of the new @entity11 app the @entity58 pointed out that trying to ' own ' all conversations on a single device was a losing prospect , when products like @entity45 could be used across platforms			1
it seems likely that @entity1 will roll out a fix for the accidental selfie issue , but until their @entity43 is ready for selfies , users will just have to be selfie - ready at all times .			0

the new @entity11 app allows users to send photos , video and *voice* memos
the photo message tool does not have an edit function , and sends the photo right after a user has taken it
