@entity0 says free - scoring @entity1 will fear nobody at this summer 's @entity4 finals as they aim to make history by winning their first major tournament			1
having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the year , the @entity9 striker is working hard to rediscover her best form ahead of the finals in @entity13 in june			1
@entity1 have never progressed beyond the quarter - finals in their three previous @entity4 appearances but @entity0 , who has 11 goals in 16 games for her country , is convinced @entity20 's team can go further this time			1
@entity1 forward @entity0 holds aloft the @entity22 's flag as part of the ' road to @entity13 ' campaign @entity0 pictured in action for the @entity1 team during a match earlier this season she told @entity29 : ' we do n't fear anyone , we have lots of belief			1
we 've come up against the likes of @entity35 , the @entity36 and @entity37 before and one of our aims is to overcome the mental block we seem to get at the quarter - final stage			0
' we play with freedom , we have no fear and we enjoy expressing ourselves			0
i do n't think you 've seen the best of @entity1 yet and we have so many different goalscorers			2
we 're getting better all the time			0
' @entity48 allows @entity0 the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of her @entity1 career so far , with highlights including hat - tricks for the @entity54 against @entity55 and @entity56 in qualification for the finals			1
in all , she found the net on 10 occasions as @entity1 coasted through their qualification group with 10 wins from 10 in the perfect start to @entity20 's tenure after he replaced @entity66 following the 2013 @entity67			2
in the process , @entity1 scored a remarkable 52 goals and the task now is to translate that prolific scoring form into the tournament itself			1
@entity0 said : ' it was the perfect qualfying campaign for us , the whole team pulled together and we were able to get 10 wins out of 10			2
@entity20 came in as coach and took everything in his stride			0
' it was nice to score 10 goals myself and that included my first hat - trick , against @entity55 , which was a nice feeling			0
@entity0 chases for the ball during a @entity88 match with former club @entity89 the 23 - year - old gained previous tournament experience with @entity1 at the 2013 @entity67 ' we conceded just the one goal , which is obviously almost perfect and i think we showed that we have strength in the squad from no 1 to no 23 and that 's what you need at a @entity4			1
' but just as her thoughts were starting to turn towards the new women 's @entity88 season and the @entity4 in @entity13 beyond , @entity0 suffered the worst injury of her career			1
the knee problem kept her on the sidelines for eight weeks , required surgery and ruined pre-season plans			0
it left @entity0 needing to prove her form and fitness to the @entity1 management team all over again			1
she said : ' the timing was very unfortunate , coming in a @entity4 year			2
it really killed my confidence and was difficult to deal with because it was the first time			0
' i needed major surgery and missed pre-season but i knew it was going to be a big year for both @entity9 and @entity1 and it has made me appreicate my time on the pitch a little more			1
' i 'd like to think i 'm good enough to make the @entity4 squad but @entity20 will definitely have a selection headache because it is such a good group			2
but i will put in the hard work and hopefully will get in			0
' she made her three lions return in the recent friendly with @entity127 , playing the last half - hour of a confidence - boosting 2 - 1 success on her home ground of @entity9 's @entity132			2
@entity0 scored 10 times in a @entity4 qualification campaign that saw @entity1 with a 100 per cent record @entity9 are among the favourites for the @entity88 title this year june 9 @entity138 june 13 @entity139 june 17 @entity140 hailing from @entity141 , @entity0 started out at @entity142 , working her way through the youth ranks and into the senior side during the 2007 - 08 season			1
she did n't look back , becoming a first - team regular and earning a first @entity1 cap in september 2012 having gained tournament experience at under 19 and under 20 level			0
@entity0 was then signed by @entity9 in 2013 as they started out in the @entity88			1
they announced themselves as a force in the game by winning the @entity155 and are set to challenge for the @entity88 title this year			0
@entity0 said : ' we won the @entity155 last season and hopefully we can continue that in the @entity88 this year			2
we need to be more consistent over a longer period			0
' the title race is going to be a close one but we 've made a good start and are positive about our chances			0
' we have a winning mentality at @entity9 that goes hand - in - hand with @entity1			1
it 's an honour to play for them and we have a fantastic opportunity to go out and win trophies			0
' on her journey with @entity1 , which she hopes will inspire the next generation , @entity0 adds : ' it is a dream come true for me to represent my country			1
' to be in the first team for @entity1 hopefully to be on the verge of a @entity4 call - up			2
as a kid , i did n't even know there was an @entity1 team for women so wearing that shirt , whether it 's your first cap or your 25th , is amazing			0
' @entity0 is on the # @entity186 , supported by @entity187			0

@entity1 have never advanced past last eight at the @entity4
but striker @entity0 says they *'ll* head to @entity13 in june ' without fear '

she had to recover from serious knee injury earlier this year
