so many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass , although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line , giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery			1
the blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black - masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder			2

in december @entity43 released their first images of the shocking punishment as part of a release that also showed men accused of rape being crucified and left for dead in the centre of @entity40			1
similar images emerged in january and early february of men being thrown from ' the highest point in the city ' following accusations of homosexuality			2
in a horrific twist , both of these men somehow survived the fall but were then stoned to death by the crowds gathered below			1
and just last week another young man was thrown off a roof and stoned to death after being accused of homosexuality			1
following a trial in an islamic state court , the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below			2
the man was described as a ' child of @entity145 ' and accused of committing acts of sodomy			2
@entity145 is referred to in the @entity148 and the @entity149 , where it is claimed the people of @entity151 carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by @entity153			0
the @entity1 cherry picks sections of the @entity149 and misinterprets the accounts of the @entity158 in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say			0
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in @entity165 and @entity2 , where @entity43 has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of @entity138 law			0
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the @entity158 and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example			0
but now @entity181 clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from @entity138 's holy book , the @entity149 , and from accounts of @entity158 's actions and sayings , known as the @entity189			0
an @entity43 member parades through the streets of @entity11 in @entity2 waving an @entity1 flag and brandishing a gun			0
experts have now said that @entity43 misinterprets the @entity149 in order to wage jihad it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections			0
writings by the group 's clerics and its @entity206 online magazine , @entity205 , are full of citations from @entity149 verses , the @entity189 and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners			2
but @entity212 , an assistant professor of @entity214 at @entity215 in the @entity216 , says these are taken far out of context by @entity43			0
he explained that @entity138 scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that @entity43 represent the extreme			0
