an @entity1 high school pupil , expelled and jailed for a fortnight for having a penknife in his car , now fears that his dream of serving in the @entity7 army could be wrecked			1
@entity10 @entity9 ’s nightmare began on december 12 last year when his car was searched by staff at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity1 — about 60 miles northeast of @entity14 – following a message that he posted to his @entity17 account			1
“ the principal said he had reason to believe i had weapons in my vehicle and needed to search it , ’ @entity18 said			1
‘ it was somewhat awkward			0
then they took my car keys			2
i told them what was in my car and said , “ do n’t be alarmed ”			2
’ the school claims that the online message gave it ‘ probable cause ’ to search @entity9 and his car , something that @entity18 disputes			1
@entity18 is trending more than @entity50 and the missing plane he told @entity52 : ‘ i declined to allow them to search myself or my car and that i wanted to talk to my lawyer or my father			1
they told me it was n’t an option			0
’ the school found the penknife , a stun gun and two airsoft guns			1
airsoft is similar to paintball			0
the stun gun was for self - defence , @entity18 said , adding that the penknife was part of his emt kit			1
‘ my stun gun was locked in the glove box , ’ @entity18 told the @entity36 , ‘ and the knife was in my emt medical vest			1
' i bought it at @entity73 and have it as part of my first responder kit for cutting seat belts			0
@entity18 has dedicated his life to public service since he was 14			2
after he serves in the @entity7 army he wants to become either a policeman or fireman ‘ there are kids at my school all the time who get caught with knives and are suspended			1
‘ my school is very rural , and people carry knives			0
‘ i can accept the fact that there was a lapse in judgment , and i can accept a punishment , but i have already been expelled from both the tech school and my home school			0
’ the teachers called the police and @entity18 was charged with illegally taking the knife onto school grounds			1
staff told @entity52 that possession of the knife broke the school ’s zero tolerance policy for bringing weapons on campus			2
they also insisted @entity18 consented to the search			1
servant of the people : @entity18 , 18 , from @entity1 , wants to serve his country but fears that his career plans may be wrecked because he carried a four - inch penknife onto school premises @entity117 : @entity18 was a pupil at @entity12 until the headmaster and deputy headmaster found a penknife in his car boot superintendent @entity122 said : “ we indicate that we have the right to search , and he was aware of the policy			1
’ the right is enshrined in the school handbook , added @entity128			0
the decision to charge @entity18 was made entirely by the police and the public prosecutors , he said			2
@entity18 who is a trainee paramedic and after service in the army wants to be either a policeman or fireman will learn his fate when he has a court hearing on april 1			1
i dedicated my life to public service , and now a four - inch penknife could ruin everything he has already been expelled from the @entity146 ’s future soldier @entity144 programme			2
if his plan to enlist in the army in august is not achieved , he has said that he is considering suing			0
‘ if i am convicted of a felony , i ’m never going to be a policeman			0
i ’m never going to be a fireman			0
i ’m never going to be in the military , ’ he said			0
‘ i wo n’t even be able to be a janitor			0
i ’m 18 years old , and this is going to ruin my entire life			0
‘ never in my life did i think this would happen , ’ @entity18 said			2
‘ i dedicated my life to public service , and now a four - inch penknife could ruin everything			0
