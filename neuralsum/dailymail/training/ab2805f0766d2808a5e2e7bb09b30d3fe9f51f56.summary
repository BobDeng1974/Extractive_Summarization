the @entity0 - an ancient coalition of all - female warriors - smoked cannabis , bore tattoos and fought in fierce battles like men , according to a new historical investigation			1
' archaeology has now proven without a doubt that there really were women fitting the description that the @entity13 gave us of @entity0 and warrior women , ' historian @entity7 tells @entity16			1
' they fought , hunted , rode horses , [ and ] used bows and arrows , just like the men			0
' @entity26 to dispel long - standing beliefs that these women were mere fiction , ms mayor , based in @entity24 , @entity25 , studied a wealth of textual , artistic and archaeological evidence about them before penning her book , @entity0			1
the excavations of thousands of burial sites from these regions have turned up skeletons - originally presumed to have been male - which were buried with weapons and battle horses			1
modern dna testing has proved that many of these skeletons are in fact female , and bear the same sorts of war injuries found on male remains			0
every one of these @entity42 skeletons , both male and female , were also found to be buried with their own ' hemp - smoking kits ' and , sometimes , their own ' tattoo kits			1
' ms mayor points to the ancient historian @entity65 , who described gatherings in which @entity42 would burn a plant he specifically referred to as ' cannabis ' and become ' intoxicated ' around the fire			0
modern discoveries : amazons were known to ' intoxicate ' themselves with cannabis and were buried with their own ' hemp - smoking kits ' and , sometimes , their own ' tattoo kits ' evidence also exists that @entity42 women often bore ' beautifully , lovingly detailed tattoos			1
' for a long time , @entity0 - among those who believed they actually existed - were painted as ruthless lesbian war - wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons			2
no archaeological evidence supports the notion that they did this to their children , says ms mayor			0
their name was also believed to imply in @entity87 that these women would cut off one of their own breasts in order to better wield a bow and arrow			0
' anyone who 's watched @entity94 , or female archers , knows that that is an absolutely physiologically ridiculous idea , ' points out ms mayor			0
' indeed , no ancient @entity87 artworks - and there are thousands - show a woman with one breast			2
' ancient slander : theories that @entity0 were ruthless lesbian war - wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons have been proven highly unlikely the widespread allusion that @entity0 were all lesbians is a myth too , one that did n't develop until the @entity109			1
while their ' strong bond of sisterhood ' was depicted in classical art and literature , ancient @entity13 did not , ms mayor insists , refer to them as lesbians			1
she argues that the ancient @entity13 and @entity115 were ' not shy ' about discussing or engaging in homosexuality , male or female , and if the @entity0 had been lesbians , this would have been mentioned			1
what was mentioned , was that @entity0 may indeed have been ' man - killers ' but they were also ' man lovers			1
' rumors to bed : ms mayor ( right ) based in @entity24 , @entity25 , studied a wealth of textual , artistic and archaeological evidence in order to write her book , the @entity0 ( left ) according to popular folklore , they refrained from having sex with men except for once a year , when they would visit neighboring tribes and copulate with male members so that their race would n't die out			1
as the legend goes , girls were kept but baby boys were either mutilated , killed , or sent back to their fathers			0
sending sons to be raised by other tribes was indeed customary , ms mayor says , but more as a common way of ' sealing treaties ' and ' preventing incest			0
' at the time of their existence , @entity0 seem generally to have been admired			2
' the @entity13 were both fascinated and appalled by such independent women			2
they were so different from their wives and daughters , ' explains ms mayor			0
' yet they were captivated by them			0
pictures of @entity0 on vase paintings always show them as beautiful , active , spirited , courageous , and brave			2
' here and now : as ms mayors mentions , female warriors still exist today ; most notably of late , a young @entity156 woman called @entity157 who was reported to have killed ' more than a hundred @entity154 fighters ' popular theme : fictional female fighters from recent times include @entity163 : warrior princess in the 90s ( left ) , @entity94 ' @entity165 ( center ) and @entity168 ' @entity167 ( right ) as ms mayors mentions , female warriors still exist today ; most notably of late , the @entity171 women currently fighting @entity172			1
last week , for example , a young @entity156 woman called @entity174 was reported by @entity176 to have killed ' more than a hundred @entity154 fighters ' and for the purpose of entertainment , female fighters have arisen in shows from @entity163 : warrior princess in the 90s , to @entity94 and @entity168			0
' it 's sort of fair to say that @entity0 , both as reality and as a dream of equality , have always been with us , ' concludes ms mayors			2
' it 's just that sometimes that fiery @entity189 spirit is hidden from view or even suppressed			0
right now they 're blazing back into popular culture			0

the @entity0 were ancient *tribeswomen* *feared* and admired by the @entity13 for being female warriors
excavations of thousands of burial grounds surrounding the @entity45 prove they were buried with their weapons , ' hemp - kits ' and ' tattoo kits '
*contrary* to popular folklore , they do not appear to have been lesbians or man - haters
