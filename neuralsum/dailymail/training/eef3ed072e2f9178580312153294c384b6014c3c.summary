the questions start now , even before @entity1 pulls up a seat at the @entity4 consulate in @entity5 to take the interview necessary for his @entity4 working visa			1
those loose ends need to be tied for the @entity9 to earn his wonderful living as a @entity12 player			1
but then the real examinations start - the test of his reconstructed knee after a terrible injury ; the test of his abilities after a season spent between treatment room and the fields of a lesser competition ; the test of his commitment within a week of that ‘ @entity29 ’ tweet			0
all being well , he will take his significant bag of tricks onto the field for @entity34 against @entity35 in the @entity36 in @entity5 on friday night			1
@entity49 : 91 games , 87 goals			1
@entity45 : 22 games , 13 goals			1
overall : 200 games , 172 goals			1
@entity12 have already seen one expensive signing excel in an international friendly this week , @entity58 taking a stride in answering those who feel this £ 60m signing was a luxury the club could do without			1
he was magnificent , his outside - of - the - boot assist for @entity64 in @entity66 ’s 4 - 2 win over @entity67 the work of a rare talent			0
he had two other assists and a goal on wednesday			0
so , over to @entity1 , a man who cost £ 6m to rent from @entity45 for a year , whose salary comes to £ 280,000 a week			1
the hope at @entity75 is that the formalities with his visa will enable a debut against @entity80 on september 14			0
at his best , he is a striker who might just make up for the obvious defensive and midfield deficiencies in the @entity12 squad			1
conceding three does n’t matter if you score four , and all that			2
his record in front of goal is brilliant			0
injury lay - off : @entity1 missed the @entity90 with a cruciate knee ligament injury at @entity92 – 45 goals in 105 games ; at @entity46 – 72 in 87 ; at @entity49 - 70 in 91 ; at @entity45 13 in 22			1
for @entity34 he has 20 goals from 51 games			1
they are fantastic numbers , those of a wrecking ball in front of goal			0
they compensate for his slight lack of a wider contribution – he has assisted only 12 goals for team - mates since moving to @entity106 in 2009 , a period in which he has scored 155 in 200 games			1
so goals will be the main measure of his success at @entity12			1
and to do that , his left knee will need to be strong			0
for all the excitement about the player @entity12 have signed , it must be set against a record of only two starts since he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in january			1
will he still have that acceleration , that agility to twist and turn before finishing ? early days : @entity1 made his name at @entity92 in @entity123 before moving to @entity106 it is not an ideal backdrop to his first major role at one of the world ’s truly elite clubs , even if @entity12 have seen far better days			1
it goes without saying that his record at @entity49 , his only spell in a major league , was all the more remarkable because he lacked the support that @entity135 and @entity136 enjoy			0
but with a bigger club comes bigger pressures , not least when @entity1 is seen as one of the major players responsible for getting @entity12 out of the incredible hole they dug			1
and how committed is he to that cause ? how frustrated is he that he wo n’t be part of the @entity148 side defending their @entity150 crown , a competition in which @entity1 has not appeared since 2010 ? five days ago he tweeted it was a ‘ dream come true ’ to join @entity148			2
his father , @entity152 , explained : ‘ the deal with @entity148 did not happen because if you have money and you go to the market to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers , you have to decide whether to buy it or not			0
making a splash : @entity1 was prolific during his two years at @entity46 kicking on : the @entity9 continued his outstanding goalscoring form at @entity49 short stay : @entity1 spent only one season at @entity45 before joining @entity12 this week ‘ @entity148 chose not to			1
i do n’t know , i have the feeling they wanted the player for free with a number of conditions			0
in any case , they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better			0
we have to accept it			0
’ it all leaves plenty of questions			0
another surrounds the decisions next summer , when @entity1 will be 29			2
it will be interesting to see if @entity12 then see worth in a deeper investment , or if their top - four aims have been achieved via this short - term project			2
so much will be learned in the coming weeks			0
if @entity1 is over his injury , his real disappointment and can adapt to the biggest pressure of his career , @entity12 might just have signed the best out - and - out striker in football			1
and what a coup that would be			0
he needs his visa first			0
the following stats are based on 2013 - 14 domestic league seasons : @entity196 35 games			2
109.63 mins per goal @entity200 33 games			2
95.61 mins per goal stellar season : @entity200 earned a £ 75m move to @entity206 by scoring 31 goals for @entity208 @entity209 33 games			2
140.05 mins per goal @entity136 31 games			0
89.43 mins per goal @entity216 31 games			0
166.69 mins per goal different role : @entity216 scored five goals at the @entity90 but plays deeper for @entity221 @entity135 30 games			2
81.94 mins per goal @entity225 26 games			0
193.22 mins per goal @entity64 23 games			0
90.53 mins per goal proven record : @entity64 has the best goals - to - games ratio in @entity235 history @entity236 21 games			2
