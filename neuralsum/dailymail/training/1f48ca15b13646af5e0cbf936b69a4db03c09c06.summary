by @entity0 published : 00:04 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 13 march 2012 @entity1 and other former senior officers at the @entity3 are facing a £ 2.4billion legal claim from furious investors			1
the former @entity3 chief executive is just one of 17 former directors due to receive claims letters today from the @entity9			1
they are accused of glossing over the dire financial health of the company when it went cap in hand to shareholders to raise money in april 2008			0
pressure : former @entity3 chief executive @entity1 and ex-chairman @entity19 ( right ) are among bosses who will receive claim letters from shareholders demanding compensation for ' misrepresenting information ' the bank was later bailed out with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money , just months after the £ 12billion rights issue			1
investors suffered huge losses , with the bank ’s share price slumping from a high of 607p in march 2007 to just 25.37p yesterday			0
the action is being taken by the @entity9 , which sent a letter to @entity3 and a small group of former directors yesterday			2
the group represents almost 7,500 private shareholders and powerful institutional investors including @entity41			2
also being sued : former group finance director @entity42 and ex-head of investment banking @entity44 ( right ) are also being blamed for an alleged cover - up that forced shareholders to pay out £ 12bn it alleges that there was ' an incredible cover - up ' at the bank , which maintained it was not short of cash and even allegedly concealed a loan from the @entity55 government			1
@entity57 lawyers @entity58 will today send letters to the bank , mr @entity1 , former chairman sir @entity19 , former head of investment banking @entity44 and the former finance director @entity42 , among others			1
2012 did not get off to a great start for @entity1			2
on january 31 , he joined the ranks of @entity65 and @entity66 by being stripped of his knighthood - after the @entity68 decided his actions had brought the system into disrepute			1
and last month , mr @entity1 resigned as a trustee of the @entity74 ’s personal charity to avoid further embarrassment to the @entity76			2
the shamed banker , who was once a regular visitor to @entity78 , quit the @entity74 ’s @entity79 just days after his honour was annulled			0
mr @entity1 , who led the @entity3 to the verge of collapse , became the public face of the banking disaster which plunged @entity85 into recession and cost taxpayers billions			2
he quit his role as chairman of the @entity90 in 2009 in the wake of public anger over the bailout of @entity3			0
but his role since 2004 as one of six trustees of the @entity74 ’s personal charity , which distributes money to good causes , did not emerge until last year			0
a number of other professional bodies have considered stripping mr @entity1 of fellowships they awarded him			2
these include the @entity104 in @entity105 and the @entity106			0
investors allege @entity3 hid the truth about its desperate finances , including the fact that it had taken out a loan from the @entity112 , when it asked for the cash			0
they also claim that mr @entity1 , who was stripped of his knighthood in january , had publicly denied the need for a rights issue , stating only two months earlier : ' there are no plans for any inorganic capital raisings or anything of the sort			1
' shares in the bank were changing hands at 200p at the time of the rights issue , but by october that year they had plummetted to just 65.5p			0
the following december @entity3 received its first £ 20billion government bailout , and it got a further injection of £ 25billion in taxpayers ' money 12 months later			1
the huge rescue bailouts and collapse in share price left shareholders significantly out of pocket			0
despite concluding that @entity3 's near collapse was due to poor management , the @entity135 did not take action against mr @entity1 or any other of the bank 's directors			1
nevertheless , the shamed bank boss , who quit on a bumper pension , was stripped of his knighthood			1
action group coordinator @entity145 told @entity147 : ' we are anxious to get mr @entity1 and others into a witness box to ask them certain questions			1
' there is tremendous anger and absolute hatred			0
' they did n't give us information - it was an incredible cover - up			1
' the group is backed by 7,400 private shareholders and 80 institutional investors , including @entity160 , @entity41 , @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163			0
a spokesman for @entity3 told the @entity165 that the group has ' substantial and credible legal and factual defences ' to the claims			0
the bank will ' defend itself vigorously ' , the spokesman added .			0

investor group alleges ' incredible cover - up ' after bank demanded £ 12bn from shareholders months before bailout
@entity1 one of 17 former directors to be sent claims letters demanding £ 2.4bn compensation
comes just two months after @entity1 was stripped of knighthood
