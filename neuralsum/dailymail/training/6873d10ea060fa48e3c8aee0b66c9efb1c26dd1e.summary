as people across the @entity4 struggle to stick to their @entity5 , an 11 - year - old @entity1 boy is offering lessons in self - discipline and delayed gratification after winning a $ 500 prize from his parents for skipping sugary drinks for a year			1
a year ago at @entity14 time , @entity13 's parents offered him and his older brother @entity15 a choice - a guaranteed $ 100 then or $ 500 in a year if they avoid pop , milkshakes , hot chocolate and sugary beverages			1
patience brings rewards : @entity13 , 11 , poses alongside his jumbo check for $ 500 - the prize from not touching a soda for 12 months @entity15 took the $ 100			1
he tells the @entity26 that it was n't that difficult , with the exception of remembering not to accept a pop at a friend 's house			2
he says he stuck to the challenge by thinking about ways he could spend the money			0
@entity13 's parents drafted a contract , which resembled a legal document , to enforce his behavior over the year to come			1
the contract - signed by all parties on january 4 , 2014 - is a promise to drink only water , though it allows plain milk as an exception			0
notwithstanding a medical disaster , @entity13 signed away his right to enjoy any other liquid sustenancne , with sofa , coffee , fruit juice and @entity50 all specifically banned			0
to be extra sure , the contract included definitions of both ' drinking ' and ' water ' , pointing out that soup was ok because it is considered ' eating '			0
when asked by a local news reporter what he would do with the cash , @entity13 joked : ' i could buy 500 pops '			2
contract : the agreement , drafted with legal precision , allowed @entity13 to drink only water and plain milk for an entire year			0

@entity13 , from @entity26 , @entity1 , *abstained* for ' @entity65 '
he and brother could get $ 100 on the spot - or give up soda and win $ 500
@entity13 's older brother @entity15 took the money - but @entity13 took the risk
one year later he has won the money - and joked he *'ll* spend it all on sodas
