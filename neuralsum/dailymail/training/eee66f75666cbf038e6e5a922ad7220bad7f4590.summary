@entity0 produced one of the great one - day innings at @entity3 on saturday but it was not quite enough for @entity5 to pull off their highest successful one - day international run chase on home soil and clinch their first series triumph under new management in glorious fashion			1
instead , @entity11 pulled this fourth one - day international out of the fire in a thrilling finish to level a 50 - over series of extremes at 2 - 2 with just tuesday ’s game at @entity17 to come			1
it looked certain that @entity5 were stumbling towards a heavy defeat in this @entity21 series when they crashed to 111 - 5 in search of 301 to win with fewer than 22 overs remaining			1
clinical : @entity25 of @entity11 takes three wickets as they just edge out @entity5 in the fourth odi stepping up : @entity0 top scored for @entity5 during the fourth odi against @entity11 inaugural : it was his maiden odi century for his country flipper : just like in the last game , @entity33 won the toss and elected to field opener : @entity38 ( left ) opened the batting for @entity11 before going on to score 71 @entity40 man : @entity41 was the key man for the tourists , scoring 112 off of just 104 balls nabbed : but he was eventually stumped out by wicketkeeper @entity0 after 158 minutes at the crease yet @entity0 , first in company with @entity47 and then with @entity48 , went so close to upsetting all the odds with a brilliant 121 off only 74 balls , the fastest one - day international hundred in @entity53 ’s history , as @entity5 fell agonisingly short of an historic triumph			1
‘ that was a hell of an innings and @entity58 does n’t deserve to be on the losing side , ’ said @entity5 captain @entity33 after @entity11 ’s nail - biting victory			1
‘ it was certainly one of the best innings i ’ve seen			0
i wish i could play like that			0
’ somehow @entity0 , with his extraordinary array of shots and improvisation , got the target down to 92 off the last 10 and then 12 off the last over handed to one of the best death bowlers in the world in @entity25			0
@entity0 ’s hundred came off just 61 balls , the fastest by an @entity73 anywhere , but heartbreakingly for @entity5 it was to prove in a losing cause			1
the experience and nous of @entity25 was ultimately just too much for @entity5 , @entity0 being run out trying to scramble a single from a perfect yorker in the middle of the final over , as @entity11 won a quite incredible game of cricket by seven runs			1
there was little sign of the drama to come on a day when @entity5 had earlier displayed many of the shortcomings that have long bedevilled their one - day cricket			0
if @entity5 thought that @entity11 would be shellshocked after being blasted out for 67 in @entity93 then they were to be disappointed as the application the tourists displayed in @entity96 returned after they had been inserted by @entity98 formidable total was based around the class of @entity41 and @entity100 , two @entity102 veterans with a staggering 652 one - day international appearances between them , who knew precisely how to build a 50 - over partnership in favourable conditions			1
paceman : @entity108 ( right ) was @entity5 's best bowler on the day taking 4 - 55 scalp : @entity11 's @entity25 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity33 for just one run crestfallen : @entity33 walking from the field after his brief spell at the crease @entity41 moved through the gears towards his first hundred at @entity3 in his long , distinguished career while @entity38 became a little bogged down before he was bowled by @entity119 attempting one scoop too many			1
once the pair had added 172 for the second wicket , @entity5 were sure to be facing a big target but they did peg @entity11 back as they ended their innings on 300 - 9 when 330 had looked probable			1
@entity108 , with four wickets , was the pick of the @entity5 attack but @entity5 ultimately paid a heavy price for settling for containment rather than trying to be penetrative while @entity11 were setting out their stall			2
@entity5 have never successfully chased 300 in a home one - day international — they have done it twice away — and they certainly did not look like ending that record when @entity33 and @entity134 had fallen with only 10 on the board to the enduring brilliance of @entity25			2
from there the @entity5 innings initially subsided into a predictably meek affair , with their batsmen both failing to reach the boundary often enough and also struggling to read the mystery spin of @entity142 and @entity143			0
resistance : @entity145 made 43 for @entity5 off of 68 balls coming together : @entity145 colliding with @entity100 whilst chasing a run at one stage @entity5 went a staggering 130 balls without a boundary as they looked outdated and under - strength — until their innings was turned on its head once @entity155 was fifth man out with almost 200 still needed			0
@entity5 believe their top order can adapt to any one - day conditions and that they do not need the explosive hitting of @entity159 , but the methods of their top four will only take them so far when they play on surfaces like this at the @entity164 in @entity165 next year			0
it was only when @entity0 joined forces with @entity47 that @entity5 had any invention and energy in their batting , with the brilliant batsman - keeper finding the gaps and the power that had eluded @entity174 and @entity145			2
the longer their partnership went on the more that @entity11 ’s nerve ends became frayed			0
@entity47 may have played the supporting role in his stand of 133 off 16.2 overs with @entity0 but his running between the wickets had been brilliant and he could not believe it when he top - edged an attempted sweep off @entity143			0
when the dust settles @entity5 will remember the best demonstration yet of @entity0 ’s supreme talent rather than the disappointment of falling short here			2
‘ i just tried to have a bit of fun out there , ’ said @entity0			0
it was certainly fun while it lasted			0
fightback : @entity0 celebrating his half century during @entity5 's run chase runner runner : @entity47 and @entity0 formed by far @entity5 's best partnership of the afternoon close but no cigar : in the end , though , @entity5 fell just short			2

@entity0 makes 119 but @entity5 just fall short of 301 target
@entity11 scored 300 - 9 with @entity41 making 112
@entity5 finish on *293* - 8 losing by just seven runs
tourists level the series at 2 - 2 with one odi remaining
