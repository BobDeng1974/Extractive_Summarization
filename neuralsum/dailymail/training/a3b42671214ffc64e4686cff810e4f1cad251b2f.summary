men 's brains are wired to make them ignore food when sex is on the menu , researchers have claimed			0
a study found that men can suppress their hunger in order to focus on finding a mate			1
the study by the @entity13 point to how subtle changes in the brain 's circuitry dictate differences in behaviour between males and females			1
a study found that men can suppress their hunger in order to focus on finding a mate ( stock image shown ) assistant professor @entity27 said : ' while we know that human behaviour is influenced by numerous factors , including cultural and social norms , these findings point to basic biological mechanisms that may not only help explain some differences in behaviour between males and females , but why different sexes may be more susceptible to certain neurological disorders			1
' the research looked at a microscopic roundworm called @entity40 and focussed on a pair of neurones called @entity43 that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner			1
scientists looked at two genders , males and hermaphrodites , who are mating partners for males and are considered to be the equivalent of females			2
they put the worms in a petri dish and gave them food , leaving them the option to either feed or go in search of a mate			0
some worms had been genetically engineered to make them more sensitive to the smell of food by tampering with their neurones			0
the findings were made in experiments involving @entity40 , a microscopic roundworm that has long been used by researchers to understand fundamental mechanisms in biology			1
many of the discoveries made using @entity40 apply throughout the animal kingdom and this research has led to a broader understanding of human biology			2
in fact , three @entity81 in medicine and chemistry have been awarded for discoveries involving @entity40			2
@entity40 is particularly useful in the study of the nervous system and scientists understand in great detail the development , function , and multiple connections of its entire neural network			2
the research looked at a microscopic roundworm called @entity40 and focussed on a pair of neurones called @entity43 that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner			1
it was revealed that the normal male worms left their food source and went in search of a mate			0
however the males who had been genetically engineered to be ' hungrier ' were ten times less successful at mating as they wanted to stay by the food source			0
the hermaphrodites stayed put and simply waited near the food source			0
the study published in the journal @entity111 suggests that the normal worms were able to ignore or even suppress their hunger in favour of finding a mate			1
prof @entity27 in the @entity116 and @entity117 and @entity118 said : ' these findings show that by tuning the properties of a single cell , we can change behaviour			0
' this adds to a growing body of evidence that sex - specific regulation of gene expression may play an important role in neural plasticity and , consequently , influence differences in behaviours - and in disease susceptibility - between the sexes			0
