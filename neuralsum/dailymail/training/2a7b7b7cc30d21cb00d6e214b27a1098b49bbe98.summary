read @entity1 's match report from @entity3 here the @entity5 striker could easily have been sent off in the 17th minute after he caught @entity6 in the face with his arm			1
the contact did not appear to be deliberate but he did push @entity6 in the face			0
strict referees , who do not permit any contact above the neck , would have dismissed @entity14 but @entity15 , sensibly , chose to caution him â€” not surprising for a referee who approves of physical football			2
@entity15 was then absolutely correct to award @entity18 a penalty for a clear handball			0
@entity14 cut a frustrated figure at @entity3 , and he was jeered when substituted @entity14 was shown a yellow card by @entity15 for this collision with @entity6 @entity14 is shown a yellow card in the first half ( left ) before being substituted in the 65th minute ( right )			1

@entity14 was shown a yellow card in the first half
the @entity5 striker caught @entity6 in the face with his arm
on another *day* , @entity14 could *'ve* been sent off
@entity15 made the right *decision* in showing a yellow card
