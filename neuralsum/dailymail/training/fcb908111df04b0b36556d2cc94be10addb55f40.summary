three girls a day are at risk of having their genitals ' mutilated ' in @entity3			1
their clitorises are hacked off in unsterilised conditions , condemning them to a life of pain and in many cases infertility and the inability to ever feel sexual pleasure as adults			2
@entity14 was nine - years - old when her mother took her into the bush in @entity17 and pinned her down while an old lady cut away at her with a rusty knife			1
‘ she started hacking away			2
i remember the pain and trauma of it			2
the knife was so rusty it felt like it was going on forever , ’ @entity14 told @entity20			1
today the 26 - year - old , who lives in @entity25 , still recalls every painful moment of the day she was ‘ mutilated ’ and the years of mental and physical torture she has endured since			1
@entity14 was nine - years - old when her mother took her into the bush in @entity17 to have her circumcised ‘ i was minding my business as a child and then my mother got home and said we were going for a “ holiday ” …			1
we got into a car and ended up in the bush in a remote area			2
‘ an old lady came out and had a chat with my mum			2
she was very scary looking and had a rusty old looking knife in her hand … my mother took my clothes off and pinned me down on the floor , ’ @entity14 told @entity20			1
‘ i thought they were going to slaughter me			0
she lay on my body above what i now know as a clitoris and cut off that piece of flesh			1
‘ my struggling did n’t help at all			0
then she just threw it across the room almost like it was the most disgusting thing she ’d seen in her life			0
‘ i was lying there in shock … it was so confusing and the pain down there was unbearable			2
once it was done she put us back in our car took to us to a friend ’s house			0
’ @entity14 moved to @entity3 at the age of 10 after her family was granted refugee status @entity14 was born in @entity69 but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to @entity17 for safety and then on to @entity3 when they were granted refugee status in 2001			1
as a child @entity14 did n’t know what had happened to her or why and for years amnesia state stopped her recalling that terrifying day			1
‘ you do n’t ask question to parents or adults in our culture , ’ she explained			2
@entity14 ’s mother ‘ circumcised ’ her before she came to @entity3 at the age of 10 because of a lack of education ; she thought it was the right thing to do			1
once @entity14 came to @entity3 she was sick ‘ all of the time ’ with insomnia and depression			1
she began volunteering for a charity in @entity3 called @entity90			1
she helped educate doctors , police officers and people in the community about @entity95 , but all of the while not realising that it was what had happened to her			0
this photo was taken of @entity102 ( centre ) shortly after the horrific procedure was carried out and she had arrived in @entity3 it was n’t until she saw a diagram of the three types of @entity95 performed on women and children that the memories came flooding back			1
she noticed the image of a whole clitoris and labia majora cut off and instantly identified with it			1
‘ i had amnesia but it all came back to me and from then on i realised i was mutilated in these people ’s eyes and that was how the world looks at me			0
‘ this was what happened to me on that terrible day i realised			0
it was like i was back at that place			0
’ from that day on it was something she will never forget			0
‘ i wo n’t forget even when i ’m 50 , i ’ll always be able to tell you even when i ’m 80 … it ’s so traumatic , so shocking to the system			0
‘ not knowing what was about to happen to me on that day made it worse … there was no pre warning or conversation or knowing what i was getting in to			0
the 26 - year - old is now an award - winning human right 's campaigner who has set up her own charity called no @entity138 to help women and girls here ‘ that was a shock itself for the body let alone the pain from the cutting and the betrayal from my mother doing it to me even though she thought she was doing it out of love			1
a girl is ' at risk ' if : ‘ i ca n’t forget that			0
even if i ’m asleep and you wake me up			0
i will always remember , ’ @entity14 said			1
the 26 - year - old describes her relationship with her mother as ‘ complicated ’ and the anger she felt towards her when she found out what she ’d done to her is clear in every word @entity14 speaks			1
‘ once i knew what she took away i was very angry at what she did … as an @entity164 i am damaged and i have been abused			0
there is nothing nice about that , ’ @entity14 explained			1
she confronted her mother and asked why she had circumcised her at the age of nine but her mother ‘ saw nothing wrong with what she did ’			2
‘ she thought it was a sign of love , self - control over sexuality and all that nonsense … but really i do n’t see how i am empowered by having no clitoris			1
’ in @entity179 circumcising girls is seen as the norm in some communities			2
but @entity14 has spent more than half of her life growing up in @entity3 , she identifies herself as @entity164 and she feels very much part of the western country ’s ‘ clitorial - centric society ’			1
‘ @entity3 celebrates the clitoris as a symbol of women ’s sexuality and it ’s an amazing thing , ’ she said			1
@entity14 and her team were finalists at the @entity193 in @entity194 on thursday night ‘ i did n’t give her permission to take mine away			1
no way in hell was it a positive thing			0
it was so traumatic - even now i am angry			0
‘ i will be angry for the rest of my life … and her refusal to acknowledge the pain she caused me			2
‘ she took away something that made me feel powerless and invaded me in the most scared way but she did n’t get it , for her it was ok			0
’ at school @entity14 felt ‘ different ’ to other children and questioned whether she could still define herself as a woman			2
she did n’t like her body and she did n’t ‘ feel pretty down there ’			0
‘ my private place is a place of trauma			0
when i take a shower i can feel the scar			0
i ca n’t forget it			0
’ she suffered period pains and such bad stomach cramps that she would crawl on the floor in pain and get strong painkillers from hospital to help her cope			1
she was told she probably would n’t be able to have children of her own			2
@entity14 is now eight months pregnant			2
her baby boy is due in february and she just hopes he will be a ‘ healthy little boy ’			2
she calls her pregnancy a ‘ miracle ’ but even now her @entity95 is impacting on what should be a happy time			0
she continues to fight to stop the violence ' against women and little girls ' so that ' another human being does n't go through this life sentence ' she ’s had to deal with health professionals with ‘ a lack of knowledge and sensitivity ’ and still does n’t know if she will be able to have a vaginal birth in two months due to her scarring			1
‘ i ’m scared it ’s going to be like @entity95 all over again , ’ she said			0
@entity14 has been working to abolish @entity95 in @entity3 , setting up her own charity called no @entity138 to provide healthcare and educational support for women and girls			1
she also plays a vital role in preventing more children being mutilated in @entity3 and wants to change the perception that this is about culture			1
‘ it ’s not about culture it ’s about violence against women and little girls			1
they ca n’t speak up for themselves			0
‘ in @entity3 the law say this is illegal and this is child abuse and there is no cultural defence			1
' even back home laws are changing all across @entity179 … this is a universal concept … it ’s wrong and we are being cowards finding any excuse not to take action , ’ she said			0
@entity14 explained for her this is not a political fight , she ’s doing it because she has to live with it ‘ every single day and there is nobody else that will know what it is			2
’ ‘ i would n’t wish this on my worst enemy			0
i know it is a life sentence and it never ends			0
the consequences never end , from mental health to sexual health			0
‘ your vagina becomes a war zone or trauma zone – this is what i fight for , so another human being does n’t go through this life sentence			0
