advised to take painkillers : @entity7 , pictured with husband @entity21 , died only hours after visiting hospital the inquest , held at @entity24 , heard that mrs @entity7 visited @entity25 on june 1 last year			1
she was sent away after being told the pains were down to the way she was holding her 13 - week - old daughter @entity29			2
mrs @entity7 ’s mum @entity30 , who has 40 years ' nursing experience , broke down in tears at the inquest as she described how her daughter collapsed			1

' i told her to sit back and i shouted to ( mrs @entity7 's husband ) @entity21 to get the baby and told him to call an ambulance			1
' i pulled her on to the floor			0
i started @entity42 , but there was just nothing			0
' the ambulance seemed to take ages to arrive			0
her lips were blue , i just held her on the floor , kept doing cpr			0
tragedy : the dance teacher was told her pains were probably due to how she held her baby daughter ' i checked her pulse and there was nothing			1
' @entity58 pathologist @entity57 , who conducted a post-mortem on mrs @entity7 's body , found the cause of death to be ' unascertained '			2
coroner @entity63 was told that mrs @entity7 had been assessed as a minor injury patient , and no @entity65 ( @entity66 ) or blood tests had been carried out to try to find out the cause of her pain			1
when asked why , dr @entity70 , who examined mrs @entity7 , replied : ' all her findings were normal			2
' the doctor added : ' there was no indication for blood tests so i did not feel i had to do the blood tests			0

' if those investigations had been done , could this have presented this lady 's death or reduced the risk ? ' if they had been abnormal in some way , she would have been admitted to hospital			2

' coroner @entity63 heard that mrs @entity7 was assessed as a minor injury patient at the hospital dr @entity92 said that , had the cause of the collapse been due to a blood clot , the outcome would have been the same			1
