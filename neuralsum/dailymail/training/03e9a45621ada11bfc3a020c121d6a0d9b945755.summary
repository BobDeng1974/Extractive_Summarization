@entity11 , a mitigation specialist who is trying to build a case that will humanize @entity15 and help convince a jury not to sentence her to death , was found carrying one of @entity15 ' drawings out of the @entity5 in late february			1
@entity21 and the rest of @entity15 ' legal team argued that the artwork is part of her defense case , and they planned to display it to the jury when her sentencing trial begins on september 8			1
@entity30 : @entity11 , seen right next to @entity4 after her guilty verdict was handed down in may , was found bringing one of @entity15 ' drawings out of prison and is no longer allowed to visit as a result the sheriff 's office was concerned that she was carrying the drawing - which showed a multi-color drawing of a pinwheel - on behalf of @entity15 in order to deliver it to someone on the outside			1
' the only material provided to @entity11 was legal material , and i find what the jail is doing is outrageous , ' ms @entity11 's attorney @entity42 told the @entity48			2
' i personally find it outrageous , because @entity11 is beyond reproach and is one of the finest mitigation specialists i 've worked with			0
' one of @entity15 ' lawyers from her murder trial confirmed that they regularly brought her artwork out of prison because they presented some of it during the five - month trial that started on january 2 , 2013 and ended on may 8 after the jury reached a guilty verdict following 15 hours of deliberation			2
color work : @entity4 has been producing drawings while in prison as she waits to have a new jury determine whether she will face the death penalty or life in jail @entity15 , who murdered her boyfriend @entity4 , is in jail awaiting a second round in court where a new jury will determine whether or not she should be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison			1
the sentencing trial is set for september 8 after rounds of delays			0
@entity15 , a photographer by trade , has been working actively on her drawing skills and used it as a form of income during her trial by selling off works that she made from behind bars			0
supporters have maintained a website where her work is available for sale			0
waiting for the next step : @entity15 ' lawyers also put in a motion to have the possibility of the death penalty taken out of the jury 's range of options but no verdict has been handed down on that her rates have gone down dramatically since her guilty verdict was handed down in may , however			2
her drawings were being sold for thousands at the peak of the trial - like one of @entity115 that went for $ 3,050 - as opposed to the two drawings currently available on the site			0
both pieces - one of a sailboat at sunset and another of a vase of calla lillies - are on sale for $ 39			0
the @entity48 reports that @entity15 ' legal team submitted multiple motions to judge @entity127 on monday including one to allow ms @entity21 to be able to visit the county jails both for @entity15 and her other death row clients			1
another motion pushed for the death penalty to be removed from the list of options that will be presented to the new jury .			0

@entity138 , a mitigation specialist working with @entity15 ' legal team , has been caught bringing one of the murderer 's drawings out of prison
judge has since banned her from visiting @entity15 or any of her other clients
@entity11 , whose *job* it is to try to humanize @entity15 to the sentencing jury , said that it has been common practice because they feature her art in court
@entity15 was found guilty in may of murdering her ex boyfriend @entity4 but the jury could *n't* decide on her sentence
a different sentencing jury will convene on september 8 to determine whether she should be put to death or face life in jail
