by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson it ’s fair to say that it ’s not exactly car - horns and fireworks on the streets of @entity6 at the news that the club are signing @entity9			1
‘ not as good as @entity11 ’ ( who they were never likely to get anyway ) and not as young as @entity14 ( ultimately far too expensive ) summed up the immediate reaction			0
this was tempered by the fact that the former @entity18 man is a year younger and probably a better option than @entity21 ’s @entity20			0
but the worst thing about the signing is that he joins from @entity25			2
they did wonders for @entity25 ’s accounts and nothing for @entity6 ’s trophy - winning chances			1
in 2000 @entity51 sold @entity31 and @entity30 to the @entity52 for a combined £ 32m			1
@entity31 stayed for four trophyless , injury - plagued years			2
@entity30 was gone in one season sold back to @entity54 for £ 7m			1
@entity55 arrived too and fared far better but he is a blip on the chart			0
in 2006 @entity6 wanted @entity58 but @entity51 made sure they waited a full season and still paid £ 16m when they signed him a year later			1
@entity58 at least fared better on the pitch than @entity31 and @entity30 but he still took a year to get going and @entity25 had clearly already long since had the best from him			1
top of the flops : @entity6 put a £ 70million release clause on @entity65 , but the midfielder would later struggle to break into @entity68 's first team while on loan back in the @entity70 not needed : @entity71 was bought to play in midfield or defence but has hardly featured at the @entity74 @entity75 relishing @entity6 challenge @entity77 was perhaps @entity51 ’s greatest victory			1
he signed him for £ 500,000 and eight years later sold him back to @entity6 for £ 35m			1
@entity77 failed to fit back into the club he had left aged 16 and never saw out the five - year contract he signed			2
at least on this occasion a large part of that original outlay is understood to have been recouped by his ‘ undisclosed fee ’ signing for @entity54			0
and at least @entity85 and @entity58 thrilled the @entity74 scoring goals and winning trophies			0
the worst – or best , from @entity25 ’s perspective – of business between the two clubs comes by way of @entity65 and @entity71			1
captain fantastic : @entity58 and @entity77 were both captains and star players for @entity25 best times have gone : @entity58 won the @entity96 at @entity6 , but @entity25 got the best out of the striker misfit : @entity77 was courted by @entity6 for long periods but failed to settle once arriving at the @entity74 @entity65 signed a four - year deal in 2008 and @entity6 somewhat optimistically put a £ 70m buy - out clause on him			1
they ended up terminating his contract six months before it was due to expire after he failed to fit in , or persuade any of the clubs he went on loan to – @entity108 , @entity68 and @entity109 – that they should pay to sign him			0
the club are currently trying to find a new home for @entity71			0
after paying £ 15m for him in 2012 and giddily announcing that he could also play at centre back he has been largely peripheral – not really needed in holding midfield where @entity6 already have @entity117 and not able to play at the back , despite the billing given in his presentation			2
so now it ’s over to @entity9			0
he rejoins former @entity18 team - mate @entity123 and with his club history should certainly need no period of adaptation			0
his recent injury record is a concern but if he can overcome that he might be able to turn the tide of disappointing arrivals from @entity25			0
he is a least a ‘ proper ’ central defender , not something @entity6 have signed for five years .			2

@entity9 joined @entity6 from @entity25 for £ 15million
defender is the latest in a long line of stars leaving the @entity42 for @entity6
@entity58 and @entity77 are among the big money signings the @entity140 *giants* failed to get the best from
@entity65 , @entity71 , @entity31 and @entity30 also among flops
