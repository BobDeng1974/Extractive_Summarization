by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 21 september 2012 @entity1 , from @entity2 , was murdered in a suspected assassination while on holiday with his family in @entity7 the @entity10 engineer murdered at an isolated @entity12 beauty spot was on the verge of selling a ruined property 400 miles away across @entity7 , it emerged yesterday			2
@entity1 , 50 , was shot dead along with his wife , @entity15 , 47 , and his mother - in - law @entity17 , 74 , on september 5th			0
all had been on a holiday with the @entity20 ’s two children @entity21 , seven , and @entity22 , four , staying in their caravan by @entity24 , in eastern @entity7			1
the @entity20 family were all murdered as they sat in their @entity28 estate , on the outskirts of the nearby village of @entity31 , while @entity7 cyclist @entity32 , 45 , died next to the car			1
until now , @entity7 detectives assumed that mr @entity20 ’s 1 million pounds plus family home in @entity36 , @entity2 , was their sole residence			1
but @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , the regional newspaper , tonight revealed that they also had an ancient house at @entity42 , in the @entity44 department , some 30 miles from @entity45			1
it is a significant find because it proves that mr @entity20 had investment interests in the country where his horrific murder took place			1
the fact that he was involved in a property business deal will also be of great interest to investigators			0
mr @entity20 had bought the property in the medieval village , which has a population of just over 2000 people , in the 1990s for an unknown sum , and had been seen working on it over the years			1
despite this , it is today little more than an overgrown ruin , in admiral @entity64 , in the lower part of the hilled village			2
locals told @entity38 that mr @entity20 had been ‘ planning to create a small apartment in order to rent it			1
’ the paper adds : ‘ on a number of occasions he turned up to rebuild the floor and roof , before leaving the area without returning			0
’ property : mr @entity20 was on the verge of selling this ruined property in @entity44 near @entity45 ramshackle : mr @entity20 had bought the property , little more than an overgrown ruin , in the 1990s for an unknown sum , and had been seen working on it over the years @entity38 says the house has never been occupied , and is practically in the same state as when he left			1
‘ it seems that the owner had put it up for sale , but the deal had not been concluded , ’ the paper adds , displaying a picture of the house on its website			2
the development came as detectives admitted they were no closer finding the killers responsible for the outrages , nor indeed the motive			0
no theory has been ruled out , including the possibility that mr @entity20 ’s past life in @entity101 , where he was born , may have involved him with sinister forces			1
family disputes and business conflicts are also being looked at , while detectives have not ruled out the possibility that cyclist mr @entity32 may have been the intended target of a professional ‘ hit ’			2
claims that only one gun was used to kill everybody is likely to be disproved by full ballistics test results which are out in october			0
policemen investigate the scene of the murder in the forest near @entity31 and @entity24 in the @entity7 @entity115 the home of @entity1 , murder victim of the shooting in the @entity118 in @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity2 while the 25 spent bullet cartridges found at the scene are all of the same kind , they could in fact have come from a number of weapons of the same make			0
this throws up the possibility of a well - equipped , highly - trained gang circling the car and then opening fire			0
both children were left alive by the killers , who had clinically pumped bullets into everybody else , including five into mr @entity32			2
@entity21 was found staggering around outside the car by @entity138 , a @entity10 former @entity139 serviceman who cycled by moments after the attack , but he saw nobody except the schoolgirl			0
her four - year - old sister , @entity22 , was found unscathed and hiding in the car eight hours later			0
both sisters are now back in @entity10 , and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near @entity147 .			0

@entity149 owned *crumbing* house in village some 30 miles from @entity45
find roves mr @entity20 had investment interests in the country
he had been ' planning to create a small apartment in order to rent it '
