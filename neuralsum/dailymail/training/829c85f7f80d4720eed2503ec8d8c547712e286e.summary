with @entity19 announcing his latest @entity21 squad on thursday , @entity14 joining @entity15 and @entity16 being rocked by a long - term injury to @entity18 , there was plenty to discuss for the @entity24 legend			1
find out what he made of international call - ups for youngsters @entity27 and @entity29 , and whether @entity30 was the right choice for @entity21 captain			1
@entity0 also talked about the impact @entity34 will have at @entity35 and offered some advice to the @entity38 defenders who will come up against the former @entity40 man this weekend			2
there 's also plenty of transfer talk as our man explains why @entity46 should look to replace the injured @entity18 and how @entity47 will excite @entity49 fans this season you can read all of @entity0 's answers below			1
host commentator thanks for joining us for @entity0 's views on @entity15 's troubles , @entity18 's injury , @entity19 's latest @entity21 squad and plenty more			1
you can send in your questions for next week by tweeting @ @entity5 and using the hashtag # tacklekeown or emailing us at @entity62 i think @entity16 now have to do some business with @entity18 ’s injury and @entity15 have to perform some serious surgery on that team			1
you always look to make one or two changes but they are in need of quite a few players			1
@entity72 is talking about new signings at @entity74 and you wonder if @entity76 will do something at @entity78 because they need to get cracking			2
but @entity81 left as a result of their transfer policy so it will be interesting to see what happens here			2
but you have to invest to stay in this league and every manager will probably still be hoping to squeeze in a few more deals between now and monday			2
i think it was a good signing and i think there was a real momentum at @entity93 last year with the emotion and belief they had			1
just when they might have been looking at their signings and thinking ' is there one that will catch the imagination ' , this transfer certainly does			2
he was n’t quite so good at the @entity104 but he is clearly a very dangerous			2
coming back to @entity21 he ’ll be able to live very close to where he did before and i think he is adored by the fans over here			1
before the season started it was probably @entity110 , but he has not started the season on fire			2
but in terms of starting well , i think @entity114 has slotted back in seamlessly at @entity115 and he ’s a better player than a lot of people give him credit for			0
he ’s started well and that was good business by @entity115			0
then i think few people could have had such a promising start as @entity29			0
he went from playing at right back to @entity123 , to centre back at @entity16 and now a call - up for the full @entity21 squad			1
it ’s always hard to tell at these early stages but those two have impressed me			0
well you talk about goalkeepers becoming a third centre half these days to play out from the back – i guess he took it to the next level ! goalkeepers are becoming more technically gifted so who knows what will happen in future			1
i never actually ended up in goal but there ’s always some player who fancies himself as a goalkeeper			0
in training we ’d play a lot of small - sided games so one goalkeeper would be there and then a player might join in , but these days that ’s rare with so many top goalkeepers in squads			1
the odd player might go in goal for shooting practice – they always enjoy diving and think they can do better than the keeper ! i played against @entity158 and he was lovely off the field – he was nothing like what you saw on it			0
he used to give plenty to his defenders if he thought they were at fault but he was a real character and you have to admire goalkeepers who try something a little bit different to put the opposition off			0
you always see something like that as a great challenge			0
you would welcome him to the @entity8 and i 'd certainly let him know that even if i was playing for an unfashionable club and was a lesser known player , he 'd certainly know about me by the end of 90 minutes ! what it does do is make you play at your absolute best			1
he will raise the quality of those around him in his team but as the opposition you try a bit harder and you 're more conscious of getting tight to him , even if that means getting quite physical			1
i 'd be getting the first chance to impact on him so i do n't want this to be a game thinking he 's done especially well on his debut ! i think a lot of the criticism of sir @entity195 has been harsh			0
he brought such success to the club and also brought in players who he thought would succeed right until the end			0
even when he bought @entity201 and people suspected it might be the end , he won the league			0
but when you look at the likes of @entity207 and @entity208 , i do n't think they were quite nurtured in the same way as @entity211 and @entity212 were			0
those two are now almost a problem for the club because they have n’t trained on and done as well as expected – if they had you would say it 's good management by @entity195			0
but they have not developed			0
i do think the one area where @entity195 was guilty of not securing the future was in midfield			0
he relied so heavily on @entity223 and maybe he should have got the cheque book out sooner			0
i certainly think he can be			0
he brings a different set of problems for the opposition to cope with			0
he 's got phenomenal pace			0
i do n't think i 've ever seen anyone with the same tenacity to win the ball back for his team			1
that work rate he has , you see more of that in central positions than out wide			1
when he gets the ball and links with team - mates , sometimes he needs to slow things down a bit and think things through			1
when you look at someone like @entity245 , he was n't involved as often , but he picked and chose his moments to make a telling contribution			1
i think that 's what @entity110 has to do if he plays through the middle			0
but the fans love him because of his willingness to run and to take on much bigger men – you ca n't bully him			1
really good question ! looking at the players there is such an uncertainty in their play			2
if you 're on the training pitch every day and there is only one lone voice talking you through the system , you do n’t really take ownership of it			0
certainly out of position they do n't seem to know where they are supposed to be on the pitch and it looks like there ’s almost an information overload			0
sometimes the players need to make the decisions for themselves , but playing that system is not coming naturally to them			2
the overall philosophy and method of learning is not working , but they have bought a new defender in @entity283 so i think they will be looking at a central midfielder			1
but you ca n't keep buying your way out of trouble and maybe even @entity30 can come into midfield as a creative option			1
but with @entity291 losing his golden touch and @entity293 being told he can go , they might also need a striker with genuine pace at this rate ! one hundred per cent no ! but it does show you if you do n't know where to be on a pitch , it does n't matter how quick or mobile you are , you 're not going to make it			1
i have some sympathy with @entity207 and @entity208 who have been moved from pillar to post at @entity15 and they do n’t look like serious first team contenders			1
i might know where to be at the pitch and be able to read the game , but i 'm not sure i 'd have the athleticism to cope ! @entity19 has clearly had so few options that he 's had to turn to the youth			1
i 'm pleased to see @entity312 back but it seesm that if you are in the team for a top four team - like @entity29 - you get straight in the @entity21 squad			1
it might be early for him to get in there but when you look at the other options , there are n't many ! @entity19 is probably looking at players who have a good chance of featuring over the next two years			1
it 's very early in their club careers for the likes of @entity329 and @entity27 but there are not many players out there and they will be a part of @entity21 's future			1
i think @entity329 or @entity335 could even end up playing at right back as utility men , which is indicative of where we are but i was surprised than @entity340 did not make it in there			2
@entity19 also has to look at some new candidates in midfield			1
maybe it 's time for @entity346 to claim that central position he covets or maybe @entity348 would be a safe pair of hands in there			2
i think it has to be one of the proudest moments of any @entity356 's career , both for him and his whole family			0
he was the obvious candidate among an inexperienced squad - you 've lost three players with more than 100 caps in the last 12 months			2
i have n't been in his compnay behind the scenes but i think he 's a very visual captain leading by example but he has to be wary overdoing that			2
he will need help from both @entity368 at @entity15 and @entity19 in dealing with that			1
he 's certainly maturing with his discipline but you do n't want to take anything away from his game and he needs to find that balance and i 'm sure he can do it			0
they 're good players but i think the question is where do they play ? @entity379 are very settled as a team			1
maybe if they had made the @entity382 might have been a good option , particularly with @entity384 out			0
but i 'm not sure about @entity385 , i do n't think he 's progressed as he migth have liked			0
both have also suffered a loss of form , so i do n't know			0
i thought i 'd see more from @entity389 at the @entity104 but he seems to have gone backwards as a player			0
and welcome to this week 's @entity391			0
@entity0 is answering your questions about all the big issues , so stay tuned			0
it ’s not too late to play @entity396 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			2

@entity15 need a central midfielder despite signing @entity14
the @entity402 will help make his team - mates play to their full *potential*
@entity30 has what it takes to be @entity21 captain but he *'ll* need help
@entity19 is not blessed with huge options at the moment
@entity46 should try to sign a new striker this *summer*
@entity47 is an exciting signing for @entity49 fans
