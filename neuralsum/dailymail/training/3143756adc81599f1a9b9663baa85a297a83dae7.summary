@entity0 typically promotes ideas of peace , bliss , and inner calm			0
but a new study claims that people who have spiritual and religious views are more likely to become aggressive and violent when drunk , compared to people without such beliefs			1
a @entity11 psychologist also claimed that in many cases , the stronger the person 's views , the more hostile and aggressive they are when drinking			2
a @entity11 psychologist claims that in many cases , religious people are more aggressive than people without strong spiritual beliefs when they are drunk			1
a stock image of an aggressive conversation is pictured the study found that violence decreased as spirituality increased in people who did n’t drink alcohol			1
a stock image of a woman praying is shown the correlation was discovered by professor @entity31 of @entity32			0
he said : ‘ @entity34 - in many cases the more religious someone is , the more aggressive they will become after drinking alcohol			0
’ the researcher and his former graduate student , @entity39 , defined a spiritual person as someone who ‘ finds meaning in the sacred , ’ regardless of the doctrine they follow			2
professor @entity31 said he was originally trying to create a profile of risk factors to predict alcohol - related violence			2
he examined 520 people aged between 21 and 35 years old from the central @entity50 region			1
participants in the study were randomly given an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink , after being quizzed on the degree of their spiritual beliefs			1
professor @entity31 found that violence decreased as spirituality increased in people who did n’t drink alcohol			1
but , he said he was surprised to discover that violence increased as spirituality increased in people who drank alcohol			1
he continued that the study indicated alcohol ‘ releases the beast within ’ in highly religious people , although the reasons for this are unknown			2
however , the psychologist also pointed out that his findings are preliminary and require further work to verify and explain them			2
people who regularly visit a place of worship are less likely to get involved in low level crime and delinquency , according to researchers			0
a survey from @entity82 in january , found a direct correlation between higher visits to religious places and lower crime figures , especially in relation to shoplifting , drug use and music piracy			0
researchers believe this is because religion not only teaches people about ' moral and behavioural norms ' , but also spending time with like - minded people makes it less likely they 'll get mixed up with the ' wrong crowd '			0
as part of the project , more than 1,200 18 to 34 - year - olds from across all the @entity100 's major faiths were asked about their worshipping habits			0
they were also asked about any past misdemeanours , and the likelihood they would commit low - level crimes in the future			0
in total , researchers asked respondents about eight varying types of delinquency including littering , skipping school or work , using illegal drugs , fare dodging , shoplifting , music piracy , property damage and violence against the person			0
although the study found varying degrees of correlation between increased church visits and decreased crime rates , the most significant were seen in relation to shoplifting , the use of illegal drugs and music piracy .			1

@entity50 psychologist has found a correlation between religion and alcohol
the study did not focus on a specific religion , but belief in a ' sacred ' being
when sober , spiritual participants were found to be less hostile than those without strong beliefs
but violence increased as spirituality increased in people who drank alcohol
*experts* claim further research is needed to verify and explain the finding
