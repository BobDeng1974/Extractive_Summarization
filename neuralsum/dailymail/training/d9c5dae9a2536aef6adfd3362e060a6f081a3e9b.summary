by @entity0 a @entity1 couple among the 100,000 - plus people in the state left uninsured because of a gap left by @entity5 and @entity6 have separated in order to stay covered			1
@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 have moved apart because couples whose household makes less than $ 15,510 do n't qualify for @entity5 subsidies and @entity1 , like most @entity14 , has refused to expand @entity6 to fill in the gap			1
debilitated by epilepsy and dependent on pricey medications , going uninsured is not an option for @entity8			2
now staying healthy means not getting to see her husband of 33 years every day			0
sad : @entity9 , left , and his wife @entity8 are some of the 100,000 - plus @entity21 who make too little money for @entity5 subsidies but for whom the state refuses to extend @entity6 benefits			1
to keep her @entity6 , @entity8 -- who requires pricey epilepsy medications -- separated from her husband of 33 years trouble began for the drains when 62 - year - old @entity9 decided to retire early last year			1
' in september of last year , i made what looking back on it in retrospect was the worst decision i ever made in my entire life , ' he told the @entity37			0
' i decided to take early retirement from @entity39			0
' but the fault does n't lie solely with the @entity30			0
the @entity42 @entity41 struck down the part of the @entity44 that required states to expand @entity6 for people like them			1
and @entity1 , where a @entity6 expansion failed miserably in the 1990s , and @entity48 governor @entity48 have been unwilling to expand the program in the wake of the court 's decision			1
like an estimate one in three people in the @entity14 , where nearly 4 million of the uninsured fall into the coverage gap , the @entity30 evidently did n't understand that @entity8 's eligibility would change with their drop in income			1
sticky situation : the @entity5 originally required states to expand @entity6 to those who make too little to qualify for subsidies , but like most @entity14 , @entity1 refused once that provision of the health care law was struck down by the @entity42 @entity41 but that 's precisely what happened and illness - plagued @entity8 was threatened with the possibility of losing her @entity69 and the state @entity6 benefits that go along with it			1
' after one or two months of crying and lots of prayers and lots of yelling and screaming , on dec. 26 — after 33 years of marriage — we separated , ' @entity9 told the @entity37			2
the couple now live two miles apart , with @entity8 at her mother 's house and @entity9 at the apartment they once shared , and do n't see each other every day			1
while @entity8 has kept her coverage , @entity9 remains uninsured			2
' the irony of it was i was working full time at a hospital with no benefits , ' he said			0
' when i got the job , what they explained to me was the hospital was losing money hand over fist because of uncompensated care			0
' the now - retired social worker now writes a letter to the governor via his blog each day , pleading for a @entity6 expansion			2
' in some ways , it is like a virtual sit - in , ' he said			0
' i could n't go sit in his office , but in some way i need to say , " i am here			0
i am going to be here			0
i 'm going to talk about things you do n't want talked about			0

@entity8 and @entity9 make too little money to qualify for a subsidy to help cover their *insurance* *premiums*
meanwhile , @entity1 has refused to expand @entity6 for people in their situation as the @entity5 originally intended
now the drains live two miles apart and do n't even see each other every day
