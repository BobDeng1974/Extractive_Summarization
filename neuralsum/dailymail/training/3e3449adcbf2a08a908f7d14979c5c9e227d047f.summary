by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 2 september 2013 touchscreens may have revolutionised mobile devices but when you want to access an app quickly - especially while wearing gloves or when it 's raining - nothing beats a physical button			2
this is the philosophy of @entity9 , an add - on gadget created by @entity13 developers @entity11			0
the small button plugs into a phone 's headphone socket and can be customised to perform any action			1
the button links with the @entity9 app and when pressed can be used to access the phone 's flashlight , open the camera app , send a text and more any action that can be performed on a phone using the touchscreen can be assigned to the button using the @entity9 app , pictured			1
@entity9 can also register long and short - presses , as well as a series of clicks , meaning different sequences of presses can be used for different actions to use the button , the device , pictured , is fitted inside the phone 's headphone socket			1
actions are then customised in the @entity9 app. these actions can include calling a specific contact in the address book , sending a text message , checking into @entity53 , and more			1
any action that can be performed on a phone using the touchscreen can be assigned to the button			2
@entity9 can also register long and short - presses , as well as a series of clicks			0
this means @entity9 can be used to perform a number of different actions depending on the sequence of presses used			2
the button device is fitted inside the phone 's headphone socket and sticks out 0.7cm above the top of the handset			1
the user then opens the @entity9 app and decides which action they want the button to perform when it 's pressed			2
this can include calling a specific contact in the address book , sending a text message , opening the camera app , checking into @entity53 , broadcasting the user 's location in the case of an emergency , and more			2
any action that can be performed on a phone using the touchscreen can be assigned to the button and the button can also register long and short - presses , as well as a series of clicks			0
this means @entity9 can be used to perform a number of different actions depending on the sequence of presses used			0
for example , three short clicks could be used to phone a particular friend , while a long press could turn on the phone 's flashlight , or two short presses followed by a long press could open the camera			0
each sequence can be used to perform a different action and can be changed or removed as many times as the user wants			0
sequences can also be combined , for example , pressing the button in a certain pattern can open the camera , take a photo and upload it to a social network site			0
the @entity116 device fits in the headphone socket of any @entity119 phone running @entity119 2.3 or above			1
the button sticks out 0.7mm above the handset , pictured			0
when not being used , @entity9 sits in a specially designed keyring so the headphone socket can be used to listen to music the designers have also made it possible for other developers to create ready - made actions within certain apps			1
when a user wants to use the headphone socket to listen to music , the @entity9 button fits into a keyring attached to the device , which means the headphones can be plugged in and the button can still be pressed			1
the @entity9 app is only opened each time the button is pressed , to conserve battery , and it only works on @entity119 devices running version 2.3 or later			1
@entity9 is currently a @entity144 campaign and the designers have already reached their target funding goal , meaning the devices will go on sale after the campaign closes on 1 october and are expected to be delivered by march next year			0
it is expected to cost around $ 20 ( £ 13 ) , plus $ 5 ( £ 3 ) shipping outside of the @entity151			0

@entity9 fits inside any *3.5mm* headphone socket on an @entity119 phone
actions can be customised using the @entity116 app
these actions include opening apps , listening to music and making calls
any action a phone can do , the @entity116 button can be customised to do
