by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 1 june 2013 drones could soon be delivering everything from post to drugs using a vast international network , a @entity2 firm has claimed			2
@entity8 , a @entity10 startup , has already trialled the drone network in @entity12 and the @entity13 , where they were able to fly for six miles carrying a 2kg payload			1
the firm now hopes to expand with an ambitious plan to replace existing delivery systems and set up a global network of ' drone routes ' for the gadgets , which can automatically fly themselves			0
these hubs would let the drones pick up and drop of packages , and also recharge their batteries before continuing to the next station			2
control of the drones and the assignment of packages for delivery would eventually be handled by an automated operating system , @entity8 says , and orders or requests could be placed and paid for by mobile phone			2
the firm hopes to set up recharging base stations for the drones so they can stop and recharge themselves along the way			1
currently the firm has drones that can travel six miles and carry 2kg , but has plans for larger drones with a longer range			0
the firm hopes the system will be used initially in rural areas or countries where there is no established road network			1
' the easiest way to describe what we are doing is to compare how mobile telephony has taken off in the developing world , ' @entity63 founder and ceo , @entity65 told @entity71			0
' ( we want ) to leapfrog the traditional modes of transportation infrastructure in a similar way and bring items through these unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity77 ) to people who may otherwise be cut off or isolated , ' so far , @entity8 have reached the stage of running trials of ' quadrocopter ' drones , which took place in @entity12 and the @entity13 last year			1
the firm has ambitious plans			0
' we are creating the next paradigm for transportation using a network of unmanned aerial vehicles , ' it says.the next paradigm for transportation using a network of unmanned aerial vehicles urban drones : the delivery systems could eventually be used in cities around the world to automatically deliver packages the potential applications , the firm says , include delivery of medicines to disconnected areas , enabling farmers to supply products directly to customers and providing vital materials to areas cut off by natural disasters			0
if the initial trials are a success , a version for cities could also be built , allowing existing couriers to be replaced by unmanned drones flying through the sky			0
the firm also believes the system could be relatively cheap , and according to @entity71 , a @entity8 case study of the @entity118 district of @entity119 , put the price of a network of 50 base - stations and 150 drones at just $ 900,000			1

drones could use huge networks with base station to recharge themselves
networks set to be used in rural areas with poor road networks
