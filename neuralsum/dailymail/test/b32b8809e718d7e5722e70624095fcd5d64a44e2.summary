in a moving op - ed for the @entity8 , published just a day after the two - year anniversary of their son @entity10 's death , the @entity7 have asked that @entity0 be spared the death penalty so that they can finally get closure on the darkest chapter of their lives			1

clockwise from top left : @entity6 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 victim : @entity36 died at the finish line of the @entity23 on april 15 , 2013 , after the @entity0 brothers set off twin pressure cooker bombs while the @entity52 say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their ' tireless and committed ' work to bring justice , they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21 - year - old to jail for the rest of his life			1
' we know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives , ' the @entity7 wrote			2
' we hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering , painful reminder of what the defendant took from them , which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring			0
' they say sentencing @entity0 to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims			0
' as long as the defendant is in the spotlight , we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms , not ours			0
the minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and tv screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family , ' they wrote			0
the @entity7 brought their three kids out to watch the @entity23 two years ago , and were standing just steps away from where @entity0 and his brother @entity98 ( who died in a shootout with police a few days later ) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs			0
@entity10 died in the blasts and his sister @entity105 lost a leg			0
death or prison ? last week , a jury found @entity0 ( center ) guilty on all charges related to the attack			2

the family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony			0
the @entity52 are n't the first to speak out against the death penalty in @entity0 's high - profile trial			1
the @entity8 editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week @entity144 senator @entity143 said @entity0 should ' die in prison '			2
the death penalty is outlawed in @entity144 , where the trial is taking place , but since @entity0 is being judged in federal court , execution is still a sentencing option			2
however , experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison , considering the state 's generally liberally view on the controversial issue			0
@entity0 's lead defense attorney is @entity159 , a woman who specializes in helping high - profile clients like the @entity161 escape the death penalty			1
@entity163 and the rest of @entity0 's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother 's terrorist plot			2
all together : above , @entity5 and @entity6 pictured with their three children before losing @entity10 ( bottom right ) in the bombing brothers : @entity0 's ( right ) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his more extreme older brother @entity98 ( left )			1

they want prosecutors to sign a plea deal , sending @entity0 to prison for the rest of his life and *forfeiting* his right to appeal
