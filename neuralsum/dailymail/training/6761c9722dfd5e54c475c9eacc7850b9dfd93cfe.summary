@entity1 superstar @entity0 feared he was paralysed after being kneed in the back by @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
@entity0 ’s anguish was revealed yesterday by @entity1 coach @entity6 who told @entity8 newspaper : ‘ @entity9 ran up to @entity0 and asked him how he was feeling and he told him , “ i ca n’t feel my legs ”			1
’ scans later revealed he had fractured a vertebra , ruling him out of the rest of the @entity15			2
@entity1 team doctor @entity35 said @entity0 would be out for about six weeks and added : ‘ he does not have any neurological injury that would compromise his life as an athlete or a human being			1
he will be able to pass , to run			2
’ @entity0 thanked his team - mates for their support in an emotional video recorded at the team ’s training ground before he was flown home to @entity47 by helicopter to begin his rehabilitation			1
but @entity6 knows the importance of @entity0 to the squad and has asked the 22 - year - old to come to @entity53 and cheer the team on against @entity33			1
‘ he will be with us if he can , on the bench or in the stands , ’ the former @entity56 manager said			0
‘ it all will depend on how he is			0
’ as well as being without @entity0 , @entity6 will probably have to replace @entity61 , who is unlikely to win an appeal against his second booking of the tournament during the 2 - 1 victory against @entity4 on friday			1
must go on : @entity6 ( left ) in training at @entity67 without @entity0 @entity68 ready to fill @entity0 's boots the moment : @entity0 will be ' able to pass , to run ' says the @entity72 team doctor but not at the @entity15 will he be there ? @entity0 has been invited to be ' on the bench or in the stands ' to show his support 6 - @entity77 ( @entity4 ) 4 - @entity78 ( @entity33 ) , @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , @entity0 ( @entity1 ) 3 - @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , @entity87 ( @entity84 ) , @entity88 ( @entity89 ) those in italic are out of the @entity15 through injury or elimination			1
but the biggest task for @entity6 is filling the gap left by @entity0 , who was @entity1 ’s top scorer at the @entity15 with four goals			1
‘ it ’s equivalent to a catastrophe , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ @entity0 is our reference			2
he is a player that would make the difference in any team			0
we have lost the one player we did not want to lose			0
’ the @entity72 federation confirmed yesterday that team psychologist @entity106 would visit the training ground after @entity6 admitted he found the ordeal of seeing his best player injured hard to take			0
‘ it was a big shock , ’ he said			0
‘ the image of @entity0 being carried off a stretcher towards the plane , the difficulties , the tears			0
’ but @entity116 has warned @entity33 the injury to @entity0 could galvanise @entity1			1
‘ we are all very sad @entity0 ca n’t play , ’ he said			0
‘ it is always best if all the big players are on the pitch for the big games			0
‘ but the loss of @entity0 can create strength and weld together the @entity72 team			2

@entity0 is out of the @entity15 in @entity1 after fracturing a vertebra
@entity1 beat @entity4 2 - 1 in *quarter* - final to set up @entity33 *clash* next
@entity0 will be out for six weeks , says team doctor @entity35
@entity35 says the injury will not ' compromise his life as an athlete or a human being . he will be able to pass , to run '
