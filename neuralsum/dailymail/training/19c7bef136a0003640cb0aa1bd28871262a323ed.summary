by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 17:28 est , 24 january 2014 @entity3 boots graced the footwear market forty years ago and quickly became synonymous with high vis jacket clad workman			1
but the humble boot is stepping back into the fashion forefront thanks to a few famous feet			1
all the cool kids on the block - from @entity12 and @entity13 to @entity14 and @entity15 - have been stomping around @entity16 in their beloved @entity3 boots			1
step back into fashion : @entity3 boots were more commonly associated with builders - but not since @entity20 and @entity12 have brought them to the forefront of the fashion world fashion - savvy @entity12 lead the trend , spotted by @entity24 , when she wore hers on the red carpet at the @entity27			1
and it seems her famous friends have followed suit			1
@entity31 styled his @entity33 lookbook with them , @entity14 complements her tomboy look with a pair and @entity15 even wears her with a dressing gown in her downtime			1
even @entity16 's youngest fashionista @entity39 has a pair			0
the youngster 's tiny boots were displayed right in the middle of mr. and mrs. @entity39 's in an @entity46 photo posted by @entity13			2
the one - year - old 's shoes replicate her 43 - year - old father 's , with the @entity49 singer opting for a platform , high - heeled version			1
and @entity39 has actually been spotted in her pair before			0
famous fans : @entity31 gives @entity55 the seal of approval and @entity15 even rocks hers with a dressing gown queen of cool : @entity14 loves her trusty timberlands and pulls the urban look off with aplomb speaking about the hot new trend , @entity66 , fashion and beauty editor of the @entity69 , said : ' nobody can work timberlands like the @entity72 circa 1997 - complete with baggy khaki pants			1
' in 2014 , you need a distinctly edgy street vibe a la @entity14 to really pull them off			0
' if you ca n’t resist the lure of this workboot comeback , keep them classic			2
avoid the towering heel homages that can take them into tacky territory			0
' opt for a pared - down look with leggings or slouchy trousers so your timberlands do n’t look too try - hard			2
think perfect pooch walking footwear			0
even the kids are catching on ! @entity93 's son @entity92 and @entity39 are also sporting the style ' me ? my flat shoe obsession is sole - ly dedicated to the @entity98 sneaker			2
' celebrity stylist and founder of @entity101 , @entity102 , said : ' timberlands are just the next thing in a long list of fashion must haves that have stemmed from the revival of 90 ’s fashion			0
' i did n’t like these chunky boots the first time and i am not that keen on them now , they are the most unfeminine footwear you could be seen in and the garish sand colour and the heaviness of them just does n’t do most of us any favours			2
' the best way to wear them is to recreate the " models off duty look " , wear with a slogan t shirt , baggy black harem pants with the bottoms tucked into the boots , a hoodie cardigan worn under a black leather jacket or for a different look , take a pair of black leggings worn with an oversized thigh length t shirt and an oversized checked shirt thrown over the top			0
' a serious fashion faux pas would be to wear them under jeans or indeed with a skirt or dress			0
this look is all about going a bit " ragga " and a bit " urban "			0
