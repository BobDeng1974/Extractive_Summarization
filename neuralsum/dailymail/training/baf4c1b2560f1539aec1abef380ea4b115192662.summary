by @entity0 and @entity1 an attorney for an @entity4 death row inmate who underwent a slow , gasping execution with a new drug combination has been accused of coaching the condemned man to fake symptoms of suffocation			1
@entity10 , 53 , took 26 minutes to die - the longest execution of the 53 carried out in @entity4 since capital punishment resumed 15 years ago - which renewed questions about the death penalty			1
the @entity15 said @entity16 , one of @entity18 's attorneys , was temporarily suspended last week but back at work monday after a review failed to substantiate the allegation			1
state prison records released monday say @entity18 told guards that @entity16 counseled him to make a show of his death that would , perhaps , lead to abolition of the death penalty			1
execution : death row inmate @entity10 , pictured , became the first prisoner executed in the @entity31 by the two - drug combination			1
now his attorney has been accused of coaching the condemned man to fake symptoms of suffocation punishment : the death chamber at the @entity38 in @entity39			1
@entity4 used intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity18 to death but three accounts from prison officials indicate @entity18 refused to put on a display			1
' he wants me to put on this big show in front of my kids , all right when i 'm dying ! ' @entity18 is reported as having told one guard			2
' i ai n't gon na do this			0
it 's about me and my kids , not him and his cause ! ' @entity61 , a spokeswoman for the public defender 's office , said all accounts from execution eyewitnesses - which did not include @entity16 - indicate @entity18 was unconscious at the time he struggled to breathe			1
' we have no way of knowing , obviously , because we ca n't interview mr. @entity10 , ' she said			0
upset : @entity18 , left , recounts the execution of her father , @entity10 , as her sister - in - law @entity71 cries at a news conference on january 17			1
' i ca n't think of any other way to describe it than torture , ' @entity18 said @entity61 said @entity16 was not speaking with the media			0
he did not immediately return an email message or a phone message left at a number listed under his name			0
the office 's director , @entity82 , told the @entity84 on monday that no one in his office encouraged @entity18 to fake any symptoms			2
@entity61 said @entity16 walked @entity18 through the steps involved in an execution and @entity18 's statements may have arisen from an interpretation of those conversations			1
@entity61 said @entity16 asked @entity18 to give a thumbs - up during the execution as a way of determining when he lost consciousness			1
due to ongoing federal litigation , she said the public defender 's office closely monitors the sequence of events during the execution process			0
prisons officials alerted gov. @entity106 's lawyer the night before the execution that @entity18 had been overheard telling family members he 'd been ' encouraged to feign suffocation when the lethal injection drugs were first administered , ' according to a statement released by the public defender 's office			1
victim : @entity18 , 53 , was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity116 in @entity117 in western @entity4			1
the 22 - year - old @entity118 was newly married and pregnant the investigation was first reported by the @entity84			0
@entity18 was put to death jan. 16 for raping and killing a pregnant newlywed in 1989			2
he was executed with a combination of drugs - the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone - that had never before been used in the @entity31 and his fitful final moments sparked criticism and calls for a death - penalty moratorium			2
family members wept and later said the process amounted to torture ; they have sued alleging undue cruelty			0
one report from the @entity137 suggests @entity18 believed the signaling system he 'd set up with his attorney - including the use of a thumbs - up gesture - could be used to save his life			2
the night before his execution , a corrections team leader reported being told by @entity18 that he understood @entity16 as saying ' if he started to choke or jerk in any way ' the governor would put a stop to the execution			2
experimental : @entity18 was executed at this facility by @entity4 's untested execution method two prison employees reported hearing @entity18 say that , if it were n't for his daughter being present at his execution , he would ' really put on a show			1
' the public defender 's office did not permit @entity16 or any other staff from the public defender 's office to witness the execution ' in order to avoid any appearance that @entity168 staff in any way influenced the execution process , ' @entity61 said			0
@entity4 has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the @entity175 manufacturer of the previous drug , pentobarbital , stopped allowing its use in lethal injections			0
marketed in @entity182 - speaking countries and @entity183 under the trade names @entity185 , @entity185 , and @entity185 , midazolam is a short - acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by @entity189 in the 1970s			0
the drug is used for treatment of acute seizures , moderate to severe insomnia , and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures			0
it possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic , amnestic , hypnotic , anticonvulsant , skeletal muscle relaxant , and sedative properties			0
@entity201 is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class			0
it is a derivative of morphine			0
an expert in @entity10 's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what 's known as ' air hunger ' or simply an acute shortness of breath			2
the clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one 's breathing effort			0
it is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations			0
reports from @entity18 's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred			1
as such , the appropriateness of the drugs , and the extent to which they may be cruel , will likely be reviewed by @entity4 officials before they are used in another execution .			2

@entity10 , 53 , took 26 minutes to die - the longest execution in @entity4 since capital punishment resumed 15 years ago
the death renewed questions about the death penalty
@entity18 's family say the *convicted* killer was ' tortured '
