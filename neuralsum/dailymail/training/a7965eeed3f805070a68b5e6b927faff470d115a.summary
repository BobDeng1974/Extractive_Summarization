@entity1 tv fans are furious after a big - budget costume drama about the nation 's only empress was edited to cut out her cleavage			1
the empress of @entity1 was mysteriously taken off the air last month after its star 's low - cut dresses prompted a flurry of chatter on social media			1
now it has returned to tv screens - but the shots are so tightly cropped that viewers can only see actress @entity20 's face			1
viewers went online to vent their anger at the move the tv drama , also known at @entity30 of @entity31 , was one of most expensive ever made in the country and documents the reign of @entity1 's only known empress from ad 690 to ad 705			1
it first aired on commercial satellite station @entity37 on december 21 , but was removed a week later for ' technical reasons ' , according to state news agency @entity40			1
the show resumed broadcasting on @entity42 , but eagle - eyed viewers were quick to realise what had changed			2
several posted ' before and after ' shots to @entity46 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity47 , complaining about the apparent interference by the government			1
they said the hasty cropping had left the £ 1million show 's reported stock of 3,000 outfits , including hundreds of costume changes by the empress herself , almost completely redundant			2
evidence : fans of the show , one of @entity1 's most expensive either with a reported budget of around £ 1million , posted these before and after shots from the same episode on @entity46 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity47 others complained that cutting out the @entity31 's breasts damaged the show 's historical accuracy			1
according to @entity68 , one wrote : ' in @entity72 , the higher a woman ’s social status , the lower her neckline			0
' i did n’t have a thorough study on how low their neckline is , but i think it shows that the drama should follow the historical facts			0
' no matter if the show is good or not , i do n’t agree with the media regulator ’s measures			0
' a poll of 86,000 users by @entity46 found 95 per cent thought the censorship was unnecessary			1
' can revealing cleavage really be considered pornographic ? ' wrote one			0
' is n't this feudalism ? ' ruined : some users complained that the tweaks made the star 's hundreds of costume changes redundant but some supported the move , according to @entity40			2
one , @entity95 - ko , wrote : ' i can hardly look at the tv as there are so many breasts '			0
the incident is the latest in a long line of tales of censorship and state control in modern @entity1			2
a 2013 study found almost a third of online posts which are deemed inappropriate on @entity46 were being deleted within half an hour			0
computer scientists @entity108 and @entity110 , writing for @entity112 , found some posts were deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online			0
needed : another internet user said the actress 's cleavage was necessary to ensure historical accuracy popular : the show documented the life of @entity31 , the only empress ever to rule @entity1 in her own right in november campaigners complained @entity1 has censored a wide array of websites - including @entity124 - in a days leading up to the @entity125 in eastern @entity127 province			1
and last week @entity1 @entity129 users were unable to access their accounts for days after the service appeared to have been blocked in the country , along with parts of the @entity135 search engine			2
@entity31 , the only empress ever to have ruled @entity1 in her own right , began as a concubine to @entity137 in the seventh century			0
when he died she married his ninth son and successor @entity139 , building up considerable political influence until @entity139 suffered a stroke in ad 690			0
she ruled for 15 years , enshrining @entity143 as a protected religion and ordering successful attacks on enemy garrisons before losing the throne in a coup shortly before her death in ad 705 .			0
