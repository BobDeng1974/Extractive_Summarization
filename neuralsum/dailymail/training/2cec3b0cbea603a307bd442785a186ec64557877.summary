president @entity1 's chief spokesman said monday that most on the tens of thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the @entity5 - @entity4 border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries			1
the pointed warning came as the @entity11 prepared to send a funding request to @entity13 detailing the additional money @entity1 wants to spend hiring more immigration judges and opening new detention facilities to deal with the border crisis			1
@entity11 officials told the @entity19 that they planned to ask @entity13 for more than $ 2 billion on tuesday			1
@entity11 spokesman @entity20 said the administration also wants lawmakers to give it the legal authority to sidestep a 2008 law requiring a careful evaluation of each child before deportation proceedings can begin			1
in the absence of a move on @entity58 , the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of children arriving from @entity36 countries the same way			2
that process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including @entity5 @entity67 agents – making the border even more porous			2
complicating the situation is a new set of data released last week by @entity72 , showing that the @entity1 administration has deeply curtailed efforts to deport minors or turn them away at the border			1
in 2008 , the last year of the @entity79 administration , 8,143 such children were prevented from staying in the @entity5 in 2013 that number was just 1,669			1
@entity20 told reporters on monday that that while the administration will allow the required immigration review process to unfold , officials so far do n't expect many of the children arriving at the border to be able to stay in the @entity5 ' it 's unlikely that most of these kids will qualify for humanitarian relief , ' @entity20 said			1
' it means they will not have a legal basis for remaining in this country and will be returned			0
' @entity94 secretary @entity43 acknowledged sunday on the @entity96 show ' @entity97 ' that it could take a long time for those deportations to begin			2
' our border is not open to illegal migration , and we are taking a number of steps to address it , including turning people around faster , ' @entity43 said			0
but ' we need to find more efficient , effective ways to turn this tide around generally , ' he said , ' and we 've already begun to do that			0
' @entity43 acknowledged that the unaccompanied children , some 9,700 taken into custody in may alone , pose a vexing problem			0
most of the children are from @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
the @entity11 is asking @entity13 for the authority to fast - track deportations to those three countries in particular			1
hurry up : newly minted @entity11 press secretary @entity20 said the influx of unaccompanied minors at the border wo n't change deportation policy , but that the administration wants the authority to act faster @entity11 minority leader @entity127 ( r ) was @entity128 in 2008 when @entity13 passed the law that the @entity1 @entity11 now ants relaxed while the @entity1 administration claims spikes in violence and poverty have prompted parents there to send their children on difficult and dangerous journeys north , @entity130 contend that @entity1 's own 2012 immigration policy shift is to blame			1
that summer the president held a @entity145 press conference to announce one of many ' executive actions , ' a move to delay for two years the deportation of @entity5 residents brought to the @entity5 illegally as children			1
this year the @entity11 extended that delay for another two years			0
as word of a new leniency filtered southward , aided by opportunistic traffickers , the current flood of children crossing the @entity153 river into @entity154 , and evading border patrols in @entity156 and @entity4			2
@entity43 said the @entity5 government is trying to send the message that all people who enter the country illegally will face deportation proceedings eventually			2
but in @entity36 , he said , ' the criminal smuggling organizations are putting out a lot of disinformation about supposed free passes into this country ' that will expire soon			0
the resulting onslaught has overwhelmed federal agencies			0
when 140 would - be immigrants – mostly mothers with children – were flown to southern @entity174 to ease an overcrowded @entity154 facility , angry residents of @entity173 , @entity174 , greeted the bus as it pulled into town , complaining that they were being saddled with more than their share			2
' this is a failure of diplomacy			0
it is a failure of leadership from the administration , " @entity154 gov. @entity183 said sunday on @entity185 's ' @entity184			0
' rep. @entity189 , a @entity154 @entity49 , crossed party lines sunday on @entity192 's ' @entity191 ' to complain that the @entity11 ' is one step behind ' a foreseeable crisis since numbers of children coming from @entity36 without adults has been rising dramatically since 2012			1
unaccompanied @entity36 children generally are being released to relatives already in the @entity5			1
mothers with their children often are released with a summons to appear later in immigration court			0
meanwhile , word of seemingly successful border crossings reaches their home countries , encouraging others to try			0
@entity209 @entity208 sen. @entity208 said sunday on the @entity210 ' face the @entity212 ' program that children entering the country illegally must be sent home			0
if not , he said , ' you 're going to incentivize people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children here			0
' @entity208 also said foreign aid should be cut off to countries that do n't do more to discourage illegal immigration to the @entity5 .			1

2008 law aimed at helping child trafficking *victims* requires @entity94 to evaluate unaccompanied minors before deporting them
a @entity49 - controlled @entity13 passed the measure in 2008 . and now the @entity11 wants a *loophole* to deal with the human flood at the border
the @entity1 administration does n't want to change the law , but is begging @entity13 for the legal *discretion* to sidestep it
the president 's 2012 policy relaxing the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the @entity5 as children is *widely* seen as leading to tens of thousands of children *streaming* in from @entity36
deportation of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children has fallen dramatically since @entity1 became president
