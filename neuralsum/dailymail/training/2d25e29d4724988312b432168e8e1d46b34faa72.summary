i do n't think there will be a shortage of effort			0
they will give it their best shot			0

' at the start of the summer , we set our target to start the season with 22 players - 19 outfield and three goalkeepers			1
' we ended up with 25 because we wanted to give our head coach as many options as possible			0
two of the ' extras ' are loan agreements so we are comfortable about that			0
in charge : @entity13 hopes to guide @entity3 higher than last season 's 17th place in the @entity7 talent : @entity63 arrived at the @entity64 having impressed with @entity65 at the @entity66 ' we ended last season with 26 players , we lost 10 who were released , @entity72 left , @entity71 has gone and we 've recruited 11			1
