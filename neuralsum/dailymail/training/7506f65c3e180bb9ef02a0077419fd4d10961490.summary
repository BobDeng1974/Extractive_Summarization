the @entity0 professed never even to have seen the inside of the away dressing room at @entity3 before			1
while the venerable @entity4 gushed with emotion over the glorious six months he ’d spent in his beloved green - and - white hoops			1
without wishing to spoil the mood of this love - in , it ’s safe to assume that @entity11 manager @entity10 and captain @entity4 wo n’t be made to feel too much at home as they attempt to get one over on their gracious hosts on friday night			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity11 striker @entity4 has 65 international goals and 137 caps to his name still , @entity4 - the remarkable 34 - year - old who just keeps on scoring goals - is already dreaming of getting just one more at the ground he briefly graced following his ecstatically - received deadline - day loan move to @entity23 in the winter of 2010			1
‘ i certainly hope it ’s the case , ’ said the man who has regularly hit the back of the net at some of the biggest and best grounds in @entity30			1
‘ scoring goals when you are a striker , no matter where you are , you get that exciting feeling			1
‘ but certainly , growing up and watching @entity23 and having the privilege to play here , and managing to score a few goals while i was here was extra special			1
so of course it would be nice if that was the case			1
‘ it would certainly be up there with my best moments			1
it ’s very hard to predict that now			1
but if that were the case then i ’d obviously be delighted			2
‘ honestly , the whole experience of being a player here was fantastic			2
coming from @entity50 and coming to @entity3 late at night to find 5,000 people there waiting for me was one of the best feelings you can ever get as a player			1
‘ just walking out on to @entity3 and putting on that green and white jersey , well , from start to finish the experience for me was great			1
i enjoyed every minute of it			2
’ @entity4 spent six months on loan at @entity23 in 2010 and scored 12 goals in 16 appearances fully prepared for an entirely different sort of reception tonight , not least from former team - mate @entity65 , @entity4 views boos and jeers as a badge of honour – and believes that @entity71 - born former @entity23 star @entity70 is very much of the same mind			1
‘ certainly from my experience , anyway , it ’s something that you quite enjoy , ’ said @entity73 star @entity4 , who has 65 international goals and an incredible 137 caps to his name ‘ knowing @entity70 as i do , i do n’t think it will affect him too much			1
‘ i ’m sure he ’ll rise to the occasion like he has done for the last few games			2
he ’s been here for a few years with @entity23 and was a great player for them			2
i know he ’s excited about coming back			2
‘ i do n’t think what people say or whether the crowd are going to boo him will affect him too much			2
i ’m sure they will boo him - but i ’m also sure he ’ll enjoy it			1
‘ @entity65 , when i was here , was brilliant			2
he wears his heart on the sleeve and he gives everything for @entity23 and his country			2
it ’s clear to see when you see him playing			2
i ’m sure it will be no different tomorrow			2
‘ he will be the same @entity65 that i know , going around kicking people			2
but he does n’t get the credit he deserves			0
he ’s a good football player			0
he does n’t mind a tackle , too			0
it will be interesting to play against him			0
’ @entity10 , doing his best to shrug aside the unwanted distraction surrounding @entity103 – who really should buy himself a @entity105 - style * @entity106 ? * @entity107 – and an alleged altercation at the team hotel , beamed with delight at just taking his place in a rather flimsy marquee erected outside @entity3			1
@entity4 talks to @entity11 assistant manager @entity103 ( right ) at @entity3 on thursday ‘ i must admit , it will be really strange to walk into the club and turn right , to the away dressing room , instead of left , ’ he said			1
‘ i said it jokingly but i might be serious when i say i ’m not too sure i ’ve ever set foot in the away dressing room here			0
it will be strange , i must admit			0
after the press conference , i fancy a little walk around			0
’ what he really fancies , of course , is another big result to go with wins over @entity130 away and @entity131 at home , not to mention a dramatic last - gasp draw against @entity134 in @entity135			1
@entity10 said : ‘ we are away from home			0
but we think we can get a result in the game – i think we can win the match			0
i ’m quite sure @entity141 ( @entity142 ) thinks so as well – and @entity143 will be favourites to win			0
‘ but @entity134 were very strong favourites to beat us and we managed to get something from that game			0
so we ’re going in with confidence			0
‘ this is not a 38 - game season			1
every single game is of some significance			0
@entity11 manager @entity10 ( left ) and captain @entity4 at thursday 's press conference ‘ when we ’ve finished tomorrow , we will have played three pretty difficult away games and will still be in the hunt , regardless of the result			1
‘ @entity143 have been on a good run			0
@entity141 has momentum behind him , the team and the country			0
they played exceptionally well against @entity134 in the second half and might have been unlucky not to take something from that game			0
they followed that with a must - win against @entity130 and a great result in @entity166			1
’ the man who paid £ 12million to take @entity168 from @entity169 to @entity170 obviously sees the @entity143 striker as a threat , crediting him with at least 50 per cent of the responsibility for keeping the @entity170 in the @entity174 after his arrival			1
in fact , it ’s impossible to escape the feeling that familiarity will play a crucial rule in this international ‘ derby match ’ , with the lack of surprise elements on either side possibly leading to a less open game than usual			0
one thing of which @entity10 is certain , however , is that discipline and cool heads will be key			0
‘ this type of match will test the most experienced of players			0
they will still have a nervousness about them , ’ he said			0
‘ in games like these , ironically and remarkably , sometimes the young players are the ones who shine and sail through , dismissing the nerves as they play			0
‘ the players are ready for the game , they have been for some time			0
it ’s very much the case of having some discipline about ourselves , because it ’s better if we keep players on the field			0
