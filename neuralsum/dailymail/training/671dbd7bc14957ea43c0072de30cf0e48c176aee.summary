after a @entity1 to forget , @entity0 now finds himself at the coalface of @entity4 football with a squad that is a damning indictment of the lack of depth available to the @entity10 manager			1
this is not an attack on the players themselves , far from it			0
over the past 12 months we have seen a really exciting group of youngsters emerge and no doubt many of them will go on to have fine international careers with @entity10			1
but they should not have to be the ones fast - tracked into the senior squad when many of them are not even first - team regulars for their club			0
@entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 are all making their way through club football but are now being thrust into the @entity10 squad because of the lack of talent out there			1
if you look at what ’s available , and form , then he deserves to be in the @entity10 squad			1
but at 19 and having never played for the @entity68 , it ’s worrying we have to call on him already			0
it ’s because of the lack of candidates that he has been given his chance			0
@entity31 is another exciting defensive talent but he started just 15 times in the league for @entity55 last season and it still feels very soon for him			0
i was 25 when i first played for @entity10 and had already played half a dozen seasons before i got called up			2
there always seemed to be an abundance of players and before the @entity87 arrived it was as if you had to play at least 100 games before you even came into consideration			0
@entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 won 327 caps between them but , if you exclude @entity98 ’s 95 appearances , that ’s more than the number of caps won by the rest of the latest squad combined			1
that is a lot of experience gone from the dressing room			0
there is a lot of excitement around @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 and @entity0 is unlucky that three of those players are unavailable to him now			1
but it ’s almost as if we have skipped a generation			0
@entity91 and @entity92 retired from internationals at the ages of 34 and 36 respectively but most of their potential replacements are more than 10 years their junior			1
end of an era : @entity92 ( @entity53 ) and @entity91 ( r ) have both retired from international football low point : @entity10 need to get back to winning ways after a disastrous performance at the @entity131 see if you can beat the experts by predicting this weekend 's results whatever happened to the next batch of players , who would be 27 or 28 now ? it ’s great to give youth a chance , but you need balance in your squad and we do n’t have that			1
@entity0 says he wants us to develop our young players in the same way @entity148 has but we are still a long way short of the @entity1 winners			1
eight of the @entity148 team that started the final in the @entity154 were first - team regulars for the top - three sides in the @entity157 last season			2
in @entity0 ’s current squad , only five players were regularly starting for @entity160 , @entity161 or @entity162			1
coaches , fans and the media will have to show patience			0
in a club environment , fans love seeing youngsters come through the academy and cheer them on , even if they make mistakes			0
when @entity10 fans are thrown together from all over , they expect to see the best players in the country and many in this squad are far from the finished article			2
i remember @entity10 fans groaning at me with each mistake			2
@entity51 fans were the opposite			0
@entity183 was an even more extreme example			0
but the players will have to learn fast because , with a @entity187 qualifier against @entity188 a week on monday , they may well have to be involved in something far more important than a friendly			2
next generation : much has been made of @entity10 's young players like @entity161 winger @entity110 ( @entity53 ) blueprint : @entity0 wants to develop young players in the same way that has led to @entity148 's success meanwhile , back at home ... @entity87 fixtures and team news for this weekend it ’s not too late to play @entity200 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1
