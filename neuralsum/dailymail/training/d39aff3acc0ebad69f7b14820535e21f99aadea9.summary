by @entity1 reporter published : 04:33 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 07:55 est , 9 october 2012 @entity3 today warned that mainland @entity4 is now within range of its missiles as it accused the @entity4 of conspiring with @entity7			1
it comes after @entity9 announced that it has reached a deal with @entity11 allowing it to nearly triple the range of its missiles to better cope with @entity3 nuclear threats			1
@entity3 claims the move proves that the allies are plotting to invade the country - calling the deal a ' product of another conspiracy of the master and the stooge ' to ' ignite a war ' against the @entity3			0
warning : @entity3 , which displayed an array of missiles during a military parade in honour of the 100th birthday of the late @entity3 leader @entity29 in @entity30 , claims it has missiles capable of reaching mainland @entity4 @entity7 , pictured displaying missiles with a maximum range of 180 kilometers during a parade marking the country 's @entity35 in @entity9 , has made a deal with the @entity4 to nearly triple the range of its missiles in a statement carried by the official @entity43 , a spokesman at the powerful @entity41 said the @entity3 would bolster its military preparedness			1
he said : ' we do not hide ... the strategic rocket forces are keeping within the scope of strike not only the bases of the puppet forces and the @entity4 imperialist aggression forces ' bases in the inviolable land of @entity7 but also @entity54 , @entity55 and the @entity4 mainland			0
' @entity7 's @entity57 said it has no official comment on the @entity3 's statement but @entity9 and @entity11 have repeatedly said they have no intention of attacking @entity3			1
@entity3 long - range rockets are believed to have a range of up to about 4,160 miles ( 6,700km ) , putting parts of @entity65 within reach , according to @entity7 's @entity57			1
but the @entity3 's patchy record in test launches raises doubts about whether it is truly capable of an attack			1
launch pad : the @entity73 claims these structures represent gantry footings , a flame trench and propellant buildings for a new launch pad near the village of @entity80 on the northeast coast of @entity3 earlier launch : a rocket lifts off from @entity80 , @entity3 , in 2009 @entity30 shocked @entity54 in 1998 when it sent a rocket over @entity54 's main island and into the @entity85			0
that also alarmed @entity11 because about 50,000 @entity4 troops are deployed in @entity54 and their bases could be within the @entity3 's range			2
@entity90 and @entity11 have since intensified their ballistic missile defences			0
but the @entity3 's most recent rocket launch , in april , ended in humiliating failure shortly after lift - off			2
@entity3 said it was trying to launch a satellite with that launch , but the @entity4 and other countries said it was actually a test of long - range missile technology			1
the failure suggests that @entity30 has yet to master the technology it needs to control multi-stage rockets - a key capability if it is to threaten the @entity4 with intercontinental ballistic missiles			0
and although @entity3 is believed to have a small nuclear arsenal , experts do not believe it has mastered the miniaturisation technology required to mount a nuclear weapon on a long - range rocket			2
it is unusual for the @entity3 to say its missiles are capable of striking the @entity4 , but @entity3 has regularly issued harsh rhetoric against @entity9 and @entity11			2
@entity113 pays a visit to unit 158 of the navy of the @entity116 deal : @entity7 mock missiles are silhouetted at the @entity119 in @entity9 , @entity7 , as the country reveals the @entity4 has agreed to allow it to develop longer - range missiles that could strike all of @entity3 @entity122 , a @entity123 professor based in @entity9 , said the @entity3 had no choice but to respond to @entity7 's extended missile range but it is unlikely to launch a provocation , as it is waiting for the results of @entity4 and @entity7 presidential elections			1
under the new deal with the @entity4 , @entity7 will be able to possess ballistic missiles with a range of up to 500 miles ( 800km )			2
@entity7 will continue to limit the payload to 1,100lb ( 500kg ) for ballistic missiles with a 500 - mile ( 800km ) range , but it will be able to use heavier payloads for missiles with shorter ranges			0
a previous 2001 accord with @entity11 had barred @entity7 from deploying ballistic missiles with a range of more than 186 miles ( 300m ) and a payload of more than 1,100lb ( 500kg ) because of concerns about a regional arms race			0
the @entity143 remains officially at war because the 1950 - 53 @entity145 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty			0
the @entity4 stations about 28,500 troops in @entity7 as deterrence against possible aggression from @entity3 .			0

@entity3 made claim as it accused @entity4 of ' conspiring ' with @entity9
warning comes shortly after @entity9 announced a deal with @entity11 allowing it to nearly triple the range of its missiles
@entity7 believes the north has long - range rockets with a range of up to 4,160 miles - putting parts of @entity65 within reach
but @entity3 's patchy record in test launches raises doubts about whether it is truly capable of an attack
