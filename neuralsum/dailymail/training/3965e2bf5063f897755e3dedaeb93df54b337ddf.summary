we 're used to seeing @entity1 in claret and blue , but the visitors wore a silver strip last night that made it look as though they had been wrapped in tin foil			0
the club ’s third kit was first seen at @entity11 late last month and was preferred to their all - black away kit again			0
at first glance , it looked like @entity15 had fielded a team of 11 tin men from the @entity18 , but @entity1 's performance soon showed they were not lacking any heart as they gave the home side more than a few scares at @entity23			2
@entity1 ditched their black kit in favour of a shiny silver strip at @entity27 as @entity28 reflects on a missed chance for the @entity1 at @entity23 @entity30 ( left ) goes to challenge @entity32 's @entity31 during a @entity34 game in april 1996 , a match where @entity27 manager sir @entity36 binned the the grey kit at half - time do n't expect @entity40 's team to respond by releasing their own tin coloured kit any time soon though			1
@entity27 are unlikely to ever play in the colour again after sir @entity36 binned it at half - time during a defeat at @entity32 in 1996			2
@entity27 's technical area has been vacant for much of the season with @entity40 happy to observe proceedings from the dugout and make notes on his clipboard , unlike his predecessor sir @entity36 who used it to great effect as a means of berating match officials and scaring the wits out of his players			1
@entity27 boss @entity40 watched the match from the dugout while making notes on his clipboard @entity30 ( left ) patrolled @entity27 's technical area alongside @entity1 counterpart @entity15 @entity64 ’s assistant @entity30 assumed a significantly higher profile last night , however , as he spent large parts of the game stood alongside @entity15 on the touchline			1
there was little sympathy for former @entity72 player @entity71 from the @entity1 fans as he limped off in the fifth minute			1
‘ you ’ll always be a b * * * * * d ’ was the charming refrain from the away end of @entity23 in reference to their @entity79 rivalry			0
@entity71 ( right ) was jeered off by @entity1 fans after picking up an injury , with his replacement @entity85 scoring just 22 seconds after replacing him to silence the boo boys among the away supporters the chant was drowned out when @entity71 ’s replacement @entity85 scored with his first touch from a corner having been on the pitch for just 22 seconds , and he went on to head @entity27 in front again at the end of the first half			1
@entity15 included three former @entity27 players in his team – @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 – but a serious knee injury suffered by @entity101 last weekend meant that the @entity1 boss was unable to name the same starting line - up for the 11th league game in a row			1
@entity98 ( left ) was one of three former @entity27 players that started for @entity1 as he attempts to close down @entity107 @entity108 was the second @entity27 player to be substituted before half - time after suffering a cut over his left eye in a collision with team - mate @entity113			1
the @entity114 came back on after having stitches but could n’t continue			0
@entity116 was forced off in the first half for @entity27 having taken to the turf injured blind walks off after picking up an injury as @entity27 were forced to make two first half changes talk of @entity27 turning into a long - ball team had dominated the build - up to this game thanks to some mischievous comments from @entity127 and the reaction of @entity40 who turned up at his pre-match press conference armed with statistical evidence to the contrary			2
@entity133 was not called upon at @entity23 following his central showing at @entity135 on sunday the target man at the centre of it all , 6ft 4in @entity133 , does n’t seem to mind either way			0
‘ i ’m a midfielder and i like to play a bit more defensive , but it ’s up to the manager , ’ said @entity140			0
‘ wherever he tells me to play , that ’s where i play			0
if you put me up front you know why you ’re doing it			0

@entity1 played in new third kit which caught the eye at @entity27
@entity30 patrolled technical area instead of manager @entity40
@entity71 given little sympathy by @entity1 fans after limping off early on
@entity162 *prevented* @entity15 from naming *unchanged* line - up for 11th time
@entity108 forced off in one of two first - half substitutions for @entity27
@entity133 admits he does n't mind playing defensive
