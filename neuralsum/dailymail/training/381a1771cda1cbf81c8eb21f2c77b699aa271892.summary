by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 5 october 2012 at first glance , it appears that @entity3 has stepped onto the surface of the red planet for the first time			1
in an image uncannily similar to the one created when @entity8 stepped onto the lunar surface on july 20 , 1969			1
however , in reality the martian ' footprint ' is simply a bizarrely shaped ' scuff mark ' left by @entity15 's tyre tread as the rover trundles over a ledge on the martian surface			1
that line was what he , with the help of his wife , had prepared in advance			0
the rather fuzzy tapes of the event are n't clear enough to be sure , although the ' a ' does appear to be missing			0
in more recent years , after listening again to the recording , @entity8 has acknowledged that he may have fluffed his line			2
however , more recently still , analysis of the tape indicates that the ' a ' may have be present on the recording but is too indistinct to hear			0
looking very similar to the iconic first footprint on the @entity48 from the @entity50 landing , this new raw image from the @entity15 on @entity46 shows one of the first ' scuff ' marks from the rover ’s wheels on a small sandy ridge			1
this image was taken by @entity15 ’s right @entity58 on @entity59 ( 2012 - 10 - 03 19:08:27 utc )			1
@entity22 refers to each @entity46 day as a sol - with staff on the mission working to @entity46 time			0
however , @entity8 's incredible footprint is set to remain on the lunar surface for a long time - @entity22 says the first footprints on the @entity48 will be there for a million years , since there is no wind to blow them away			1
research on the tracks left by @entity72 and @entity15 revealed the time scale for track erasure by wind is typically only one @entity46 year or two @entity76 years - so the @entity46 footprint will be long gone by the time a true footprint is left on the @entity46 surface			1
the image was produced as @entity22 revealed the rover has been using the foursquare service to ' check in ' from @entity46			1
curiosity will continue to check in at various locations throughout its @entity87 landing site , posting photos and tips as it rolls along , @entity22 officials said			0
' @entity22 is using @entity93 as a tool to share the rover 's new locations while exploring @entity46 , ' @entity90 , associate administrator for communications at @entity92 , said in a statement			1
' this will help to involve the public with the mission and give them a sense of the rover 's travels through @entity87			2
' foursquare users will be able to earn a curiosity - themed badge by checking in at museums , laboratories and other locations that generate an interest in science , engineering and technology , @entity22 officials said			0
the badge will become available later this year			0
the $ 2.5 billion @entity46 rover curiosity landed on aug. 5 with the aim of determining if the @entity87 area could ever have supported microbial life			0
the six - wheeled robot is about two months into its planned two - year mission			0
one of the footprints left on the lunar surface by @entity8 while @entity15 is currently cruising toward a site called @entity123 , its main destination is the base of @entity126 , which rises 3.4 miles into the @entity46 sky from @entity87 's center			1
@entity46 - orbiting spacecraft have detected evidence that @entity126 's foothills were exposed to liquid water long ago			0
@entity22 has been on @entity93 since 2010 , when astronaut @entity133 made the first - ever check - in from the @entity135			2
the @entity137 numbers more than 25 million users , who have made more than 2.5 billion check - ins since the free app was introduced in march 2009 , according to the @entity93 website			2
video : @entity22 scientists prepare @entity15 for its first scoop of soil for analysis			2
