the @entity1 ' top military general said wednesday that half of the @entity4 army is incapable of putting their sectarian differences aside to fight off the @entity7			1
gen. @entity8 , chairman of the @entity9 , told reporters travelling with him on a trip to @entity12 that 24 of the @entity4 army 's 50 brigades were too heavily comprised of @entity15 to effectively work together with other religious sects to combat @entity17			1
@entity1 military assessors who spent the summer in @entity4 found that the other 26 brigades could partner with the @entity1 , but they would need additional training and equipment , @entity8 said , according to the @entity22			1
president @entity34 has unequivocally ruled out ground troops in @entity4 in numerous public statements , but @entity8 revealed to members of the @entity24 on tuesday that the president told him privately ' to come back to him on a case - by - case basis			2
' @entity8 told the senators that @entity1 forces could engage in ' close combat advising ' if the circumstances called for it			2
while making it clear he was speaking hypothetically , @entity8 suggested that @entity1 troops could find themselves ' accompanying ' @entity4 troops on a mission to retake the city of @entity50 , for example			1
the general 's affirmation that the president may have to send @entity1 troops on a combat mission after all was panned as an about - face by the @entity58 and the first step towards the ' mission creep ' that dovish @entity61 had been nervous about all along			1
the @entity58 rushed to reiterate that @entity8 was not foreshadowing military action and was merely explaining how he would advise the president in a hypothetical scenario			0
but on wednesday @entity8 again alluded to boots on the ground while speaking with reporters about the situation in @entity4			0
@entity8 repeated the administration 's claims that only @entity4 , working together , could save their country from the hands of @entity17 and no amount of @entity1 military might would be able to do that for them			1
@entity4 must form an inclusive government that represents the three major religious sects in the county if it wants to defeat the @entity7 , he said			0
and then , according to @entity79 , @entity8 added , ' i 'm telling you , if that does n't happen then it 's time for @entity84 ' progressive activist group @entity85 , known for its anti-war protests , showed up at the hearing @entity8 was testifying at on tuesday to show its opposition to boots on the ground in @entity4			0
@entity8 indicated on tuesday that the @entity1 could shift forces into combat roles in @entity4 if the circumstances called for it the general also theorized that the @entity4 government may be willing to revisit its decision not to give the @entity1 military legal immunity in the country if the president @entity34 agrees to send troops to @entity4 to train its army			1
' there will likely be a discussion with the new @entity4 government , as there was with the last one , about whether we need to have ' them approve a @entity1 military presence in the country , @entity8 said			2
the @entity4 government 's refusal to sign a status of forces agreement granting the @entity1 army immunity after the conclusion of the @entity4 war led to a withdraw of @entity1 troops in 2011			1
a vocal group of @entity118 lawmakers , including @entity120 sen. @entity119 , the ranking member of the @entity24 's @entity24 , have claimed that if the @entity1 had left a residual number of troops in the country at that time , @entity4 would not be in the quagmire it is today			0
@entity8 was in @entity124 today meeting with his foreign counterpart there as president @entity34 was in @entity127 , @entity128 , to receive a briefing on the campaign to roll back @entity17			2
@entity34 will meet with @entity132 chief gen. @entity131 during his trip , as well as other @entity132 commanders			0
@entity132 oversees military operations in the @entity136 , including @entity4 and @entity137			0
according to the @entity58 @entity34 will take time to speak with other service members working to implement his strategy in @entity4 to thank them for their hard work .			0

the top military general 's admission comes the day after he suggested that @entity1 troops could be asked to accompany @entity4 forces on a combat mission
