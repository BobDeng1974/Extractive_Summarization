customers at the @entity21 branch of @entity4 's in @entity8 , @entity6 were left astounded when staff told them the restaurant had run out of its famous @entity12 chicken this week it is thought the shortcomings have been caused by a new online takeaway service launched by the chain resulting in an increase in orders , as well as customers trying to redeem points on their paper loyalty cards before they expire			1
however , the @entity8 branch may also have experienced a surge in diners this week as thousands descended on the town for the annual tennis championships			2
one customer , @entity40 , 30 , tried to dine at the @entity8 branch after watching the action at the @entity42 this week but was told by staff there was no chicken left			2

@entity4 's said this , along with the launch of its online takeaway service , had contributed to the chaos			1
