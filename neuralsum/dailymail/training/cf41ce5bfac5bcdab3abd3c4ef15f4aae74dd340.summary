it 's well - known that marijuana will get you high , but a lesser known side - effect is that it can alter our response to negative emotions and images			1
a recent study has taken a look at the brain ’s functioning in the presence of @entity13 ( @entity14 ) to understand how marijuana can affect the way we process emotions			1
@entity14 is the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant			2
the research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana			2
to qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week the @entity28 journal has published a study that has confirmed the positive effect of @entity14 to negative stimuli			1
the study , which was undertaken at the @entity32 in the @entity33 , claims that @entity14 activates the endocannabinoid system naturally found in the brain to alter our response to negative images or emotions			1
with this discovery , the study argues that marijuana may now be touted as a cure to depression and other mental ilnesses			1

the study look at the functioning in the presence of @entity13 ( @entity14 ) to understand how smoking marijuana plants ( pictured ) can affect the way we process emotions @entity14 was administered to one group while another was given a placebo			1
the men were then asked to mimic images of facial expressions either ' happy ' or ' fearful '			2
according to the study , people who had @entity14 in their bloodstream were less accurate in matching the fearful facial expressions			1
however , they were able to perfectly copy those that looked happy			0
the results were confirmed by mri scans of the men ’s brains that revealed a beneficial effect of @entity14 on emotion - processing cerebral regions			0
' @entity14 administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing , ' said the report			2
' this adds human evidence to support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulation of emotional processing			0
' scientists claim more studies - such as those using scans ( pictured ) - are needed to understand the long - term impact of cannabis in adolescence a study published last month found that teenagers who regularly smoke cannabis suffer long lasting brain damage and are in much greater danger of developing schizophrenia			0
@entity99 researchers said the drug is particularly dangerous for a group of people who have a genetic susceptibility to the mental health disorder - and it could be the trigger			0
