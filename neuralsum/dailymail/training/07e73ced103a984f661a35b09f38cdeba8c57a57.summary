@entity1 supporters reacted furiously after being asked to pay a £ 75 deposit on their season tickets for next year			1
the @entity1 , who will move into the @entity5 for the 2016 - 17 campaign , want supporters to pay the fee by april 17			1
that has prompted annoyance from a number of fans online - although the payment will be deducted from the ticket price , which is due on may 31 in line with previous years			2
@entity1 fans reacted furiously after being asked to pay a £ 75 deposit on next year 's season tickets vice-chairman @entity19 pointed out the club had spent big on the playing squad recently @entity22 celebrates scoring at @entity23 - a ground @entity1 are set to leave in 2016 the @entity5 in @entity25 will house the @entity1 from the start of the 2016 - 17 season ladies ' player @entity28 took to @entity30 to complain about the ticketing situation @entity32 midfielder @entity28 was among those who took to @entity30 to complain			1
' i may play for @entity1 but i 'm also a @entity1 fan who pays my hard earned money like everyone else for my season ticket & i will have an opinion on this , ' she wrote			1
' instead you have to pay a £ 75 non @entity44 deposit ! ! ! or pay it in full			1
oh & the deadline date has also been brought forward again			0
that 's what you get for being a loyal fan ! ! ! ' demand is high for season tickets , given it will be their last term at @entity23			1
they have increased by five per cent having been previously frozen since the club 's promotion to the @entity56			2
one fan said : ' so @entity1 keep going on about how they are making football affordable			1
yet they are putting season ticket prices up by 5 %			2
they have a lot more demand for the last season at the @entity64 so they decide to make as much money from it as possible			2
' but vice-chairman @entity19 pointed towards the significant investment into @entity70 's squad - particularly last summer			0
' since 2010 , our commitment to the fans has been to restore the @entity75 's long - term financial health , while at the same time investing substantially in improving the playing squad , ' she said			0

' instead you have to pay a £ 75 non @entity44 deposit ! ! ! or pay it in full			1
oh & the deadline date has also been brought forward again			0
that 's what you get for being a loyal fan ! ! ! ' ' the nine signings we made last summer have all made a big impact and we are planning significant further investment in the playing staff this summer			0
' we are also improving the financial situation at the @entity75 and are on course to meet our target of being clear of external debt by the time we move to our stunning new home on @entity102			0
' after last year 's price freeze across the board , i am pleased we have been able to once again freeze prices for junior supporters			2
for everyone else we have capped the increase to all tickets at five per cent , the equivalent of just £ 1.58 per game for price - band 4 or £ 2.37 per game for price - band 1			1
' over the past five years , the increase in the price of a renewed @entity118 at the @entity23 has tracked at approximately 40 per cent below the rate of inflation ( @entity121 ) , meaning a @entity118 still represents fantastic value for money			1
' the price of a @entity1 season ticket has gone up by five per cent for next season joint - chairmen @entity126 and @entity128 added : ' it is clear that our final year at the @entity23 and our first year at the new stadium will be two seasons that no @entity1 fan will want to miss. it is in response to that demand - and the pressures of managing it - that we are beginning next season 's renewals and sales process earlier than normal			1
' as long - standing advocates of making football more affordable , we are pleased to confirm that we will be freezing under - 10s and under - 16s @entity118 prices for a second consecutive year			0
' with prices starting at just £ 110 for under - 10s and £ 235 for under - 16s , we are hoping as many young @entity1 as possible can be part of what is sure to be an exciting and emotional 19 games			2
' @entity28 was right to speak out			0
it was from the heart , with a genuine concern as a fan - not as captain of the ladies team			0
and as a season ticket holder myself , i have to say i too was very disappointed by the news , at first			2
requesting a £ 75 early deposit seems to be quite cheeky			0
it feels unfair to loyal supporters , many of whom have been attending home games for 10 , 20 , 30 years			0
the message appeared to be ' pay up or lose your seat '			0
of course , that is n't the case at all and there is a perfect logic to all of this			0
demand for tickets has reached unprecedented levels at @entity1			1
every @entity56 game this season has been a sell - out so far and there are several - thousand supporters signed - up to a waiting list , hoping to get their hands on any leftover seats for next season 's farewell to the @entity23			1
this is a more of a measure to ensure a smooth transition for the eventual move to @entity25 in 2016			0
and providing the team continue to play well , there 'll be no further complaints from yours truly !			0

@entity1 supporters need to pay deposit by april 17
