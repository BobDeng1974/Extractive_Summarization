' i just wanted to document that and try to make that connection with @entity14 and contribute to it ... and not just taking sunrises and sunsets , but the lifestyle as well			2
' a lot of the photos that standout [ in my collection ] is when mother nature put on a show , but being in the place at the right time is part of that as well			0
