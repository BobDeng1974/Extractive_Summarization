by @entity0 chief executive of @entity2 , @entity3 , pledged to ' do the right thing ' after the public backlash the beleaguered boss of @entity2 yesterday promised to carry out a full review of its investments following revelations that it had pumped millions of pounds into tobacco , arms and alcohol companies			1
the charity is facing a huge public backlash and scathing criticisms from some of its own stars for putting money in controversial ‘ booze , bombs and fags ’ funds			1
critics say the investments undermine its work to help the victims of smoking - related diseases , alcohol abuse and war			1
hours after the revelations , thousands of @entity2 viewers expressed their fury on @entity37 , with many saying they wished they had never donated			1
despite initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments would generate a smaller return , chief executive @entity3 appeared to backtrack yesterday , pledging to ‘ do the right thing ’			1
speaking ahead of the @entity46 expose last night that broke the story , he said : ‘ we will do a full review of our policy after this particular programme and these discussions			0
‘ it ’s really important that the public stick with us , that they trust us to do the right thing and they understand that we are listening to the messages that are out there on the social networks			1
‘ it ’s showing us on the social networks this morning that the public do have some concern about these things			0
’ this year ’s @entity66 raised more than £ 100million after an eight - hour show on @entity68 and @entity69 , fronted by presenters including @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			2
this year 's @entity66 , fronted by presenters including @entity71 , raised more than £ 100million but some of the charity ’s own stars , including comedians @entity76 and @entity78 , have since distanced themselves from its activities , trading jokes about its connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer @entity83 and cigarette firm @entity85			1
@entity76 tweeted : ‘ will happily perform at this year ’s @entity2 if paid in guns			0
’ according to @entity2 ’s accounts from 2007 to 2009 , it placed millions in @entity90 funds that invested in the companies , including £ 2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009			0
it is sitting on a £ 100million pot of money donated by the public , despite promising to hand ‘ every pound ’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts			2
mr @entity3 – whose pay has increased from £ 111,000 to £ 131,000 since 2011 – told the @entity68 ’s @entity103 programme yesterday that the investments were ‘ a small percentage , no more than 5 per cent of our funds in any of those particular areas ’			1
stars including @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , took part in the @entity116 in aid of @entity2 but he conceded : ‘ the most important thing for us is to keep the trust and faith of the public			2
we would clearly be keen to be in ethical funds if they match other funds			0
‘ we should never forget that we are nothing without the public			0
they have given us over £ 800million to date			0
‘ all of that money , every single penny , partly because of our investment policy , has gone to people living in extreme poverty and to vulnerable communities domestically and overseas			0
we are listening to the public and we will do the right thing			2
’ but former @entity139 defence minister sir @entity138 gave @entity2 a back - handed compliment for its investment policy last night			2
he said it should be ‘ proud ’ to invest in @entity83 , saying the firm ‘ contributes substantially to the defence of the @entity144 and our way of life so that sanctimonious charity leaders may freely exercise their stupid prejudices ’ .			0
