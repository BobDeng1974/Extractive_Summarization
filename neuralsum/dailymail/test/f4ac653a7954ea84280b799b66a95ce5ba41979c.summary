@entity0 would like to remind people it is not just @entity3 playing out his own emotional journey in sunday 's @entity5 semi-final against @entity7 at @entity8			1
the @entity9 has been at @entity10 for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for @entity13 without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years			1
he missed the 2012 @entity18 final and two other @entity8 appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against @entity20 the previous november			1
his story might not have the celebrity appeal of @entity3 saying goodbye in an @entity5 final on his 35th birthday , but the desire to win the @entity5 is just as strong			1
@entity0 has been the longest - serving player at @entity13 behind captain @entity3 ( right ) @entity0 has played more games for @entity13 without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years ‘ i ’ve played at the @entity28 a few times but never at @entity8 , ’ said @entity0 , 28			1
‘ i have been dreaming about it , to be honest			2
i ’ve been at @entity13 so long			1
@entity3 deserves to win the @entity5 after what he has done for this club			1
he has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him			2
we want to win like him			2
’ when @entity0 was signed by @entity37 in 2007 , @entity13 had just been in their second @entity39 final in three seasons			1
but he has had to endure turbulent times since then ; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged @entity13 into virtual civil war			1
not surprisingly , the cup finals and trophies dried up			2
‘ i did n’t think i was going to stay this long			2
i felt after the first season i was gone , ’ said @entity0 with a laugh , having been pilloried by the @entity49 during his early days			1
‘ there have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that			0
sunday will mark @entity3 ’s 36th , and possibly last , appearance at @entity8			1
thirty - two of his games have been there for @entity63 ( including one at the old @entity8 ) and three for @entity13			1
@entity8 record for @entity67 @entity66 8 @entity8 record for @entity70 @entity69 0 three @entity8 highlights @entity63 2 - 0 @entity72 - 2000 makes his @entity63 debut at the old @entity8 the day after his 20th birthday and impresses enough to earn a place in @entity79 ’s @entity78 squad			1
plays for 81 minutes before replaced by @entity80			0
@entity63 2 - 0 @entity81 - 2008 scores his first goal at the new national stadium when he sidefoots @entity86 ’s pass past @entity81 goalkeeper @entity87			0
@entity13 2 - 1 @entity88 - 2012 having lifted the @entity18 earlier in the season , @entity3 returned to @entity8 for a sweet @entity5 semi-final victory against their @entity92 rivals , with @entity93 heading a late winner			1
‘ there was discussion about ownership , the court and all that			0
we saw a lot of senior players leaving			0
this is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy			2
’ @entity0 has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from @entity3 , @entity105 and @entity106 to one of the senior voices in the dressing room			1
he has seen youngsters @entity110 and @entity112 criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said : ‘ it is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players			0
i just think young players should n’t get carried away			0
i had real role models in the dressing room like @entity105 and @entity122			0
you saw they had success because of the way they do things , not just their talent			0
‘ ten years ago , players would have more space			2
today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming , recording or taking pictures			0
you need to have extra care			0
if you are having a glass of wine , then people say you are drunk			0
’ @entity0 tries to win a tackle during @entity13 's 2 - 0 victory at home to @entity141 on monday night @entity0 celebrates @entity143 's ( right ) second goal for @entity13 against @entity141 @entity0 is desperate to win the @entity5 and end his 270 - game barren spell at @entity10			1
the last player to have played more times for @entity13 without winning a major trophy was @entity150 who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964 , collecting just a @entity154 championship medal			1
@entity13 felt so sorry for @entity0 , who was injured for the 2012 @entity18 final win , they asked the @entity157 to send him a medal in the post			1
@entity13 ’s improvements under @entity161 have not so far translated into silverware			1
they finished second to @entity163 in a thrilling @entity165 title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners @entity20 in this year ’s @entity18 semi-finals			0
@entity161 knows , with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012 , they now have to take the cup competitions seriously			0
‘ for me , the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the @entity39 , ’ he said			2
‘ if you look at how we did in the cups we were n’t so good			0
i felt we did n’t have the squad to challenge			0
this year we ’d arrived into the @entity39 and could focus on winning a trophy			1
we have got to one semi-final already in the @entity18 and now we ’ve got another chance			2
our vision is to win trophies			0
’ @entity3 has returned to the squad after a three - match ban from being sent off against @entity184 @entity3 ( right ) made his @entity8 debut for @entity63 in 2000 in a friendly against @entity72 the return of @entity3 into the squad after a three - match ban for stamping on @entity184 ’s @entity190 is vital to calm any nerves			1
in contrast to @entity0 and others in the @entity13 team , he has played at @entity8 35 times in his career — and been on the winning side in 25 of them			1
@entity161 smiles that he will be ‘ heartless ’ in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting xi but is adamant @entity3 will make a big contribution			2
‘ i ’ve had a meal with him , talking over things , ’ said the manager			0
‘ i am disappointed i did n’t have the chance to work with him for longer			0
at 24 , i would have built a team around him like i did with @entity209			0
‘ @entity8 is like his second home			2
he knows what it takes to win there			0
he ’s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team			2
everyone respects that i want to do what is best for the team			0
status and star quality have never bothered me , really			0

@entity0 holds record of playing more @entity13 games without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years
@entity13 face @entity7 in @entity5 semi-final at @entity8 on sunday
