by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:41 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:00 est , 30 december 2013 some people claim they ’re born to sing , while others openly admit they ’re tone deaf , but what if you could take a pill and become pitch perfect ? that was the basis for a recent study that wanted to test the effect mood - stabilising drugs had on a person ’s ability to learn new skills			1
researchers from @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19 gave valproic acid ( @entity21 ) - a known mood - stabliser - to participants before training them to identify musical pitches			1
in tests , those who took @entity21 scored higher , and correctly identified more pitches , than those who were given a placebo drug			1
researchers gave participants a mood - stabilising drug before testing their ability to them to determine perfect , or absolute , musical pitch			1
those who took the drug were able to accurately identify the correct pitch more often than those who took a placebo			1
@entity34 , left , and @entity35 , right , are said to posses absolute pitch @entity21 is what ’s called a histone - deacetylase or @entity40 inhibitor			1
it is used to treat depression , epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to certain stimulants			0
according to the study , the optimum age to develop absolute pitch ( @entity48 ) is between the ages of four and six			0
this age range is known as the ‘ critical period ’ and is when the brain has what ’s called ‘ neural plasticity			2
’ by proving @entity21 can restore this plasticity could help doctors develop new neurological drugs			1
@entity21 contains histone - deacetylase , or @entity40 , inhibitor			1
it is used to treat depression , epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to certain stimulants			0
according to the study , the optimum age to develop absolute pitch ( @entity48 ) is between the ages of four and six			0
this is known as the ' critical period ' and is when the brain still has ' neural plasticity ' , and can absorb , process and develop certain complex skills			0
this includes the ability to learn how to recognise and identify different musical pitches accurately			1
famous musicians with absolute pitch include @entity34 and @entity35			0
the 24 participants who took part in the study were ‘ healthy , right - handed , monolingual , @entity78 - speaking adult males			1
’ according to the research , only males were included due to the health risks @entity21 might have on pregnant women			2
each participant was shown a video designed to teach them to associate pitch classes from the 12 - tone musical system			2
each of the notes c , @entity93 , @entity94 , f # / gb , g # / @entity96 , a # / @entity97 were assigned a proper name including @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 , pictured of these 24 subjects , 11 took valproic acid ( @entity21 ) and 12 took a placebo drug during training and testing			1
none of the participants had received any complete musical training , and those who reported having partial training did not have any training during the critical period			2
participants were then tested on what they had learnt			2
during the first test , participants who took valproate scored five out of seven , on average , compared to the placebo 's score of 3.5 , pictured each participant was shown a training video designed to teach participants to associate six pitch classes from the 12 - tone @entity133 musical system			1
for example , each of the notes c , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity134 , g # / @entity96 , a # / @entity97 were assigned a proper name over different octaves			0
these names included @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 and for the second they were @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110			0
they were chosen because they were common first names and the first letters of each appears on the same row of a keyboard			0
half of the names were female , and the other half male			0
training videos taught the participants which name corresponded with which pitch class			0
participants were then tested on what they had learnt			2
during the first test , the six proper names appeared in a horizontal row on the screen in the same order for every subject			0
participants heard one synthesised piano tone per trial , for a total of 18 trials , in a semi-randomized order			0
following each tone , participants had to identify the proper name associated with the pitch class of the tone by pressing the keyboard key corresponding to the first letter of the associated name			0
more than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group , left , while in the placebo group , right , the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range during tests , participants who took valproate scored five out of seven , on average , compared to the placebo ’s score of 3.5			1
more than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group , while in the placebo group , the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range			1
in conclusion , the researchers said : ‘ our study is the first to show a change in absolute pitch with any kind of drug treatment			0
‘ the finding that @entity21 can restore plasticity in a fundamental perceptual system in adulthood provides compelling evidence that one of the modes of action for @entity21 in psychiatric treatment may be to facilitate reorganization and rewiring of otherwise firmly established pathways in the brain			2

researchers wanted to test the effect mood - stabilising drugs had on the brain ’s ability to learn
they gave 11 males the drug valproic acid ( @entity21 ) and 12 received a placebo
all participants were trained to identify musical pitches before being tested
in tests , those who took @entity21 scored much higher than the placebo group
