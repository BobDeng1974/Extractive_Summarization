@entity20 was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 25			1

@entity5 , left , with daughter @entity58 , and right , @entity20 with her miracle girl @entity22 she tried to conceive unsuccessfully for several years and endured the pain and side - effects of the hormones needed			1
she also lost her job after taking time off work for keyhole surgery to tackle her endometriosis so she started looking for holistic alternatives			2
' it was at this point i discovered the benefits of reflexology for fertility and well - being and was recommended the services of @entity10 , ' said @entity20			1
' during my treatment , i underwent the second laparoscopy to release my ovary which was stuck down fast in my abdomen			0
' the surgeon managed to unstick this successfully but told me my right tube was damaged and blocked and needed to be removed			2
i was devastated as i had been trying to conceive for nearly eight years at that point without any luck			0
' now i would surely have 50 per cent less chance with only one tube			0
' but she says the operation went ahead and she continued with the reflexology with @entity10			0
' to my delight i got pregnant naturally and finally had the baby i always dreamed of			0
' i spent nearly eight years of healthy eating , cutting out certain things , eating foods to enrich fertility , supplements , operations , fertility treatment with no success			0
