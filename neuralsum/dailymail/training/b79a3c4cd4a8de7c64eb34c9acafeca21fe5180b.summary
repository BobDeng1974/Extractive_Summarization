it is a crumbling relic of the @entity2 boom in seaside towns around the country - and was once the largest unsupported dome in the @entity6 after @entity7			0
but the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , is now at risk of languishing as a ruin after a restoration project has stalled due to lack of funds			1
the @entity16 listed building , which was built in 1910 , fronted the @entity18 funfair for almost 100 years , and was due to be restored to its former glory by next year			2
but a project to restore the iconic building , which started in 2005 , has been plagued by funding problems , and developers are now calling on local people to push through the bid for another £ 3.5million in lottery funding			1
despite being turned down for funding from the @entity30 in april this year , a further bid is being mounted for december this year - the next available round of funding			1
it was hoped the building would return to its former glory by 2014 , putting the heart back into the seaside town , but no work has taken place on the dome for almost a year			2
architects have designed a 50 - bed four - star boutique hotel , 20 apartments , a 1950s - style diner and a pleasure garden			0
@entity71 , the mayor of @entity10 , has also put out a plea for local residents to support the bid , which could help revitalise the town			1
the developers were initially awarded £ 2.4million from @entity77 when the project began in 2005			1
this was followed by a further £ 2.2million in 2007 , and £ 1.2million from the @entity80 last year			2
but despite the several rounds of funding already received , the project remains uncompleted and in desperate need of more funds			0
@entity77 ’s first bid was turned down in april and now the earliest the cash - strapped authority can get financial support is december , adding a further unwelcome delay			2
ms @entity71 said : ' i know how important the dome is to people in all areas of the borough , not just @entity9			1
it holds a special place in their hearts evoking memories of childhood , wonderful days out and even romantic encounters			0
it ’s extremely disappointing that the regeneration of the building has stalled and we were refused funding earlier in the year			0
' as elected mayor i promise to listen to what residents had to say and that ’s why i am asking them to help us to secure the dome ’s future and show us how strongly they want the dome to be finished			0
i ’m determined not to give up on it - it ’s an iconic landmark , it ’s part of our heritage but most of all it ’s very important to local people			1
' local people have been urged to lobby the @entity30 by filling out postcards , forms and online petitions calling on the dome to be awarded financial support			1
two open days to galvanise public support by demonstrating the dire condition of the dome has been arranged for tuesday , september 24 and tuesday , october 1			0
the structure , which has been closed since the late 1990s , is surrounded by an abandoned fairground when it was constructed , the @entity18 had the largest unsupported concrete dome in the @entity6 except for @entity7 the dome is now a far cry from is bustling heydey , pictured here in the 1940s the dome used to be the centrepiece of the busy funfair the dome , pictured here under construction in 1909 , has been an integral part of the community for decades			0

@entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , has been closed for more than a decade and needs urgent repair
restoration project was *launched* in 2005 but ran out of money last year
@entity77 is urging local people to lobby the @entity30 for a further £ 3.5million
