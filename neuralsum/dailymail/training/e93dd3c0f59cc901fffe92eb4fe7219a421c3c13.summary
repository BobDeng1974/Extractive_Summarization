' @entity0 ' : @entity1 researched bomb - making methods online @entity3 was yesterday warned of a new generation of terrorists inspired by the internet			1
in a worrying first , three men convicted of plotting an atrocity to eclipse 7/7 were not recruited by radical preachers , but influenced by extremist rantings online			2
they made their own way to @entity12 where they were easily able to locate and join @entity14 training camps			1
on their return they set about raising cash , recruiting suicide bombers and building a new and deadlier type of rucksack bomb			1
@entity1 , @entity21 and @entity22 wanted to create a new landmark date of horror that would surpass the 2005 @entity26 bombings as ‘ revenge for everything ’			1
they plotted to use bombs and guns , attach knives to cars and drive them into crowds – a tactic they called ‘ the @entity36 ’ – and smear poison on car door handles			2
the group were inspired to mass murder by the internet rantings of @entity45 - born @entity44 extremist @entity42			1
and their sophisticated plot provoked fears at the highest levels of @entity50 about a wave of self - starting ‘ @entity57 ’ terrorists , so called because of @entity42 ’s rallying cry of ‘ just do it ’ – the sportswear company ’s catchphrase			1
' @entity58 ' : @entity59 born @entity21 travelled to @entity12 for terror training security experts are alarmed at the ease with which two of the men , @entity1 and @entity21 , made contact with @entity14 command in @entity12			1
they fear other fanatics have been self - radicalised and could decide unprompted to launch suicide missions in @entity3			0
in previous cases , terror suspects have been recruited or radicalised by @entity14 operatives in @entity3 before being sent overseas for training			1
fortunately , the gang made several mistakes , and in a reference to the black comedy film about bungling suicide bombers , @entity22 told his estranged wife @entity78 : ‘ oh , you think this is a flipping @entity80			1
we ’re one man short			0
’ the gang , who lived on benefits , tricked members of the public into funding the operation by posing as street collectors for @entity90 during @entity91			1
they raised more than £ 12,000 but lost £ 9,000 in just five days after gambling on the stock exchange in an attempt to boost their coffers			0
and @entity1 , 31 , bought an instant cold pack in the mistaken belief it contained ammonium nitrate , which can cause explosions			2
yesterday the trio were convicted of terrorist offences at @entity103			0
it can now be revealed that : ' the joker ' : @entity22 joked that the terrorists were like the cell depicted in the comedy film ' four @entity109 ' the plot was smashed in the biggest security operation since the 2006 attempt to smuggle liquid bombs on planes destined for the @entity45			1
counter terrorism police and @entity116 arrested 11 men and one woman across @entity59 in september 2011			2
they were all brought up in first generation @entity12 and @entity121 families			0
police and @entity116 carried out a huge bugging operation which recorded the gang ’s damning comments			1
’ a radio debate was held this morning on how to tackle the problem of extremism in @entity59			1
@entity162 , assistant chief constable of @entity163 , told @entity164 's today programme : ‘ there 's been some unfair criticism of our communities in @entity59 around their contact with the police over this issue			2
‘ there was some reporting that came to us around some of these individuals , around how they were trying to collect money with buckets on various streets			0
i ’d very much welcome people coming up to us and telling us			0
‘ the case is a really timely reminder that the terrorism threat is sometimes pretty close to home			0
as any threat , it will adapt and change as time goes by			0
’ @entity189 , who works with young @entity90 men in @entity59 on anti-radicalisation projects , told @entity164 : ‘ there has been a breakdown of trust for a number of reasons			1
this community has done a lot in tackling extremism			0
‘ in the past we have worked together			0
we 've been trying to rebuild relationships			0
it 's not been easy but we are working at a better level now and i 'm sure if we continue we will be able to rebuild our ties with police			0
‘ i 've often heard young men talk about @entity207 and there 's a lot of bravado			0
everybody wants to give someone close to them the benefit of the doubt			0
do they really understand the potential dangers of going to @entity12 ? ‘ we need to get to the people out there who sometimes are not engaged in their own communities			2
it ’s difficult to reach them			0
it ’s like a sub-culture within a culture			0
nobody wants to be seen having any relationship or connections within that			0
’ they were also inspired by @entity42 , a key figure of @entity230 , who was killed in a drone strike 12 days after their arrest			0
officials named @entity42 the architect of ‘ just do it ’ terrorism after he wrote an article in @entity240 , an @entity241 online magazine he co-founded in 2010			0
the fanatic said : ‘ assassinations , bombings , and acts of arson are all legitimate forms of revenge against a system that relishes the sacrilege of @entity252 in the name of freedom			2
’ one of the gang ’s possible targets was a military base , probably in the @entity258 , in april or may 2012 , around the time the royal wedding took place			1
the @entity261 could also have been targeted			0
trial judge mr @entity262 told the three men they will all face life in prison after the guilty verdicts yesterday			0
he told @entity1 : ‘ you are a highly skilled bomb maker and explosives expert			1
your mindset was similarly manifest			0
‘ you sought to persuade others that a terror plot here in this country was by far preferable to fighting jihad abroad			2
you were seeking to recruit a team of somewhere between six and eight suicide bombers to carry out a spectacular bombing campaign , one which would create an anniversary along the lines of 7/7 or 9/11			1
’ @entity1 was convicted of five counts of preparing terrorist acts , @entity21 of four and @entity22 of three			1
they will be sentenced in april or may			0
they were joined in the terror cell by law graduate @entity286 , 26 , who became their chief financier as they used fluorescent jackets and charity buckets to cheat the public			1
a fifth man , @entity293 , 21 , was convicted of joining the terror plot , raising money and collecting terrorist information			0
four further men , @entity298 , 20 , @entity299 , 21 , @entity300 , 24 , and @entity301 , 20 , admitted travelling to @entity12 to further the terrorist plot			1
three other people , including @entity22 ’s brother @entity304 and his estranged wife , will go on trial in connection with the plot later this year			1
probe : police raided properties all over @entity59 , including this safe house , which was full of bomb - making equipment and documents detailing how to make them safe house : the trio were based at this property in @entity318 , @entity59 , and used as the headquarters for their terror cell explosive : police uncovered a variety of powders and liquids , including this ' cold pack ' in the dingy house destroying the evidence : police found this burnt note that detailed the bomb - making process bomb - making equipment : police discovered a variety of ordinary domestic equipment including granules to keep material cold ( left ) and a pharmaceutical syringe ( right ) fundraising : @entity1 , @entity21 and @entity22 held table top sales in @entity59 where the cash raised would be secretly siphoned off to pay for trips to @entity12 surveillance : @entity116 had been watching the terror group and had planted a bug in their @entity347 where they were heard boasting about the atrocity they planned shopping : @entity22 was watched buying curtains from @entity351 as part the sophisticated spying operation by the @entity3 secret services late night : officers pulled the terrorists over as they drove to a takeaway just before midnight prosecution : @entity22 was taken from the car and is detained along with the two other men who were all found guilty of terrorism offences at @entity103 today [ caption police received no intelligence from the @entity90 community in @entity59 about the terror cell , even after relatives of four of the gang discovered they had travelled to @entity12			1
the only time police were contacted about any of them was over an allegation of aggressive fundraising , concerning their charity street collections			2
the lack of information raises questions over @entity377 , the @entity379 ’s strategy to combat violent extremism , which has police community engagement at its core			2
detective inspector @entity385 , senior investigating officer in the @entity386 , said the extended families of @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity301 and @entity300 ‘ became aware ’ the men had gone to a terror training camp when @entity299 called home.although the families immediately pressured them into returning , none contacted police			1
police and security services were aware the four were travelling , and they had been recorded talking about getting their families into paradise through their martyrdom			1
but officers decided against stopping them at that time to preserve the surveillance operation			0
according to detectives , none of the men received any terror training as they left the camps after a day			1
assistant chief constable @entity162 said that while the ‘ ideal ’ scenario would have been for the relatives to inform police of what had happened , the families had ‘ tried to do their best to bring them back and stop them from getting into harm ’			2
scam : @entity131 shows @entity286 depositing charity money they had fraudulently taken at a @entity418 in @entity419 , @entity59 trips : @entity301 and @entity300 are shown here sitting and waiting for a flight from @entity127			2

@entity1 , 31 , @entity21 , 27 , and @entity22 , 27 , wanted ' to rival 9/11 '
**ringleader*s* spent years travelling to @entity12 for ' terror training '
@entity14 backed group made videos to play after they blew themselves up
terror cell raised funds by posing as bogus charity workers in street
plotted ' spectacular campaign ' from *makeshift* bomb *factory* in council flat
eight suicide bombers would have claimed more lives than 7/7 , police say
but deadly plan was discovered after bugs were planted in @entity59 flat
police then found explosives in @entity258 when plot was at advanced stage
the security services feared the men could target military bases , *supermarkets* , cinemas and train stations with a wave of up to eight suicide bombers armed with *automatic* rifles .
the terrorists were also inspired by 7/7 *ringleader* @entity463 and said they would learn from his ‘ mistakes ’ and kill far more people .
the men were trained by the same @entity14 bomb - maker as @entity299 and recorded suicide videos after visiting a *notorious* extremist *madrasa* in @entity12 .
one of the bombers was a *respected* *teacher* at a *controversial* @entity59 @entity252 school known as ‘ the @entity475 ’ .
questions were raised about the *success* of @entity50 programmes to tackle extremism after no - one tipped off police about the gang ’s *activities* , despite *widespread* suspicions .
