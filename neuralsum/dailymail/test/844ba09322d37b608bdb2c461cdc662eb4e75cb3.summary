with six matches left and the top - four positions still up for grabs , @entity1 are keeping their options open			1
the club are not guaranteeing the manager will survive but it does not appear they have already made up their mind to sack him as they did two seasons ago with @entity36			2

' i have walked away from a club once before , many years ago , but i would not quit here because it is a different case , ' he said			0

i think we play the football i want , attractive football			0
at this moment we are not getting the results that we need , but we are going the right way			0
' you can not guess the future			0
you must say what you think about what happened and the solution			0
all the other things are a matter of trust			0
' @entity0 also did his best to lend his support for @entity75 who has fallen short of his own standards this season and is being courted by @entity36 at @entity117			0
defending his player , the @entity1 boss said : ' i feel sorry for @entity75			1
when he went to the @entity121 and we lost to @entity123 and @entity124 in the @entity125 , he was seen as guilty because he was not here			0
