@entity1 sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior , and it looks like it paid off for once			0
after much public outrage from @entity7 fans when their beloved @entity9 cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year , the team brought back the ladies during tonight 's home opener			1
sadly , the team still did n't manage to win , going down 6 - 4 to the @entity19 , to bring their season record to 0 - 2			0
fans learned the @entity9 were no longer when the @entity7 took on the @entity43 at the @entity44 in their first pre-season game of the year , and a group of men , and not women , hit the ice to do some cleaning			1
temporary leave : it is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year the boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen , who , unlike their predecessors , got to wear pants and a fleece , went to work on the ice			2
there is still no word yet on just why the @entity9 were replaced , but one of the group 's members , @entity66 , did break the news on her @entity68 this august that they would not return to the rink			2
' no # flyersicegirls this year , but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @ @entity75 & to all # @entity42 for being awesome , ' she wrote			0
working hard : the four girls on the squad can be seen above , along with a few of the men the girls are back now though , taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff - baring top , those warm new leggings and their skates , still not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees but better than those hot pants			1
the @entity7 also play an outdoor classic every year , where the temperature is about 20 degrees , so maybe they will get jackets at some point too			0
strict rules : the girls used to wear hot pants when they worked on the ice @entity99 wrote an article about the ice girls last year , and the all - female cleaning crew for another hockey team , the @entity103 , highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too			1
among other things , the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes , being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in			0
this negative coverage could be why the @entity9 were temporarily replaced by the new all - male cleaning crew .			2

@entity7 fans *welcomed* back the team 's @entity9 cleaning crew during the team 's home opener tonight
the ice girls are a group of women who clean the ice during games wearing hot pants , midriff - baring tops , and leg warmers
now , after some outrage and *feedback* , the girls get to wear leggings on the ice , making some fans upset
