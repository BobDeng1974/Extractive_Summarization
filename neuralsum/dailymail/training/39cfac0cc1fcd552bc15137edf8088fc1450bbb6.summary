writing in his @entity32 blog , @entity0 said : ‘ if @entity2 does sign for @entity4 from @entity3 , will @entity23 ‘ accept ’ him ? @entity2 is a centre forward and he wo n’t want to play out wide			1
i ca n’t see @entity2 and @entity23 linking well together			2
‘ it seems to me , if @entity23 likes you , you ’ll play			0
if he does n’t , you ’re wasting your time			0
and , to be honest , i think @entity2 is making a bit of a mistake going to @entity4 – he ’d be better suited to @entity21			2
