a gang of eight @entity2 and @entity3 senators has hammered out an immigration reform deal that could allow 11million illegal immigrants to gain legal status and , eventually , @entity8 citizenship			1
the agreement includes strict enforcement measures like stepped up border security and visa exit tracking that must go into effect before any illegal residents are given official status			1
the plan is endorsed by conservative newcomers @entity18 , of @entity19 , and @entity20 , of @entity21 , as well as liberal veterans @entity22 , of @entity24 , and @entity25 , of @entity26			0
the senators hope that the broad range of political ideology in the group - from @entity32 darlings to established progressives - will make the plan palatable for both @entity2 in the @entity34 and president @entity35			1
' first of all , @entity8 support it , in poll after poll , ' @entity61 @entity60 , a @entity63 @entity62 , said on ' @entity68 's @entity67 with @entity69 ' on sunday			2
' secondly , @entity71 voters expect it			0
thirdly , @entity3 want it			0
and fourth , @entity2 need it			0
' the senators are expected to formally announce the their proposals today , though details have already been leaked to the public			0
the deals include : lawmakers say immigration reform is ' set to be passed this year			0
' sen. @entity82 , pictured , is part of a six - member bipartisan @entity49 group working on the legislation @entity35 promised @entity71 voters that he would make immigration reform one of his top priorities in his second term			1
he plans to give a major immigration policy speech in @entity92 , @entity93 , on tuesday where he will lay out his own plan to reform the system			0
however , immigration reform is also seen as a political necessity by an increasing number of @entity2			2
@entity35 won 71 percent of the @entity71 vote in the 2012 election , compared with @entity2 @entity101 's 29 percent , according to exit polls			2
hispanic voters were decisive in his victories in the key battleground states of @entity19 , @entity106 and @entity93			0
many moderate leaders of the @entity2 are calling for the party to shift its harsh stance on illegal immigration and allow a ' pathway to citizenship			2
' ' look at the last election			0
we are losing dramatically the @entity71 vote , which we think should be ours , ' @entity61 @entity82 , who has long campaigned for immigration reform , told ' @entity67 ' on sunday			0
an @entity116 looks out over the @entity34 - @entity43 border in @entity118 , @entity21 moderates @entity2 like @entity82 argue that most @entity71 voters are socially conservative and would shift their political allegiances if the @entity2 changes its stance on immigration			1
however , the @entity49 deal reflects the reality that most @entity2 view a ' pathway to citizenship ' as an amnesty that incentives for illegal immigration			1
@entity131 , a @entity132 who is a rising star in the @entity2 , insisted that illegal immigrants ' be required to go to the back of the line ' before obtaining citizenship			1
he , and other conservatives , argue that immigrants who came to the country legally should have preference			0
many republicans in the group insisted on tightening immigration controls before any before any of the citizenship rules took effect			0
a group of border - state law enforcement officials and policymakers will have to certify that border security has been tightened			1
sen. @entity18 said the senate is making ' significant progress ' additionally , the @entity152 must develop a better exit control system to track foreign visitors and ensure the country knows which ones have overstayed their temporary visas			1
according to some studies , 40 percent of illegal immigrants arrive in the country legally , but do not leave when their visas expire			2
the proposal puts more onerous citizenship restrictions on illegal immigrants than most @entity3 support , however , the @entity49 group is hoping the tough proposal will help win over votes in the @entity34			1
the @entity2 - controlled @entity34 remains the greatest obstacle in @entity167 to passing a law that would allow a ' pathway to citizenship			2
' conservatives in @entity172 have scuttled numerous bills that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants , under both @entity35 and president @entity175 .			1

four @entity2 and four @entity3 have agreed to a plan that would step up enforcement , but also provide a ' pathway to citizenship '
deal has support from conservatives and liberals in the @entity49
senators hope that it can pass in the @entity188 and win president @entity35 's *approval*
a second @entity49 group has proposed doubling the number of visas for highly - skilled foreign workers
' @entity198 ' legal status for illegal immigrants who register with the **government** , pass a *criminal* background check and pay back taxes and a fine
those immigrants will be allowed to legally work in the @entity34 and will have a pathway to citizenship , but are not *eligible* for most **government** benefits
citizenship *provisions* will not take effect until border security is tightened and the @entity34 installs effective tracking to ensure foreign visitors do not overstay their visas
reforming the legal immigration system , including awarding green cards to immigrants who obtain advanced *degrees* in science , math , technology or engineering from an @entity8 *university*
creating an effective employment verification system to ensure that businesses do not hire illegal immigrants .
allowing more low - skill workers into the country and allowing *employers* to hire immigrants if they can demonstrate they could *n't* *recruit* a @entity34 citizen ; and establishing an *agricultural* worker program .
*loosening* residency and citizenship restrictions for illegal immigrants who entered the country when they were *children* .
