when bad things happen in good houses , there 's only one man desperate homeowners should call : @entity5 , master of disaster			1
dr disaster : @entity5 is a real estate appraiser who specializes in properties where disaster has struck @entity12 , @entity13 resident @entity5 , 54 , works as a consultant in diminution value , or stigmatized real estate			1

@entity5 's services do n't come cheap - his rate is $ 375 an hour			1
he provides his clients with reports - sometimes 100 pages thick , with details on the property 's problematic history , cases studies of similar troubles and the unmatched expert 's final appraisal			2
@entity5 's dominance and expertise in the field of stigmatized real estate has earned him the title of ' @entity43			1
' he has valued homes where some of the most infamous murders in @entity48 history occurred , including @entity50 's condo , @entity52 's home and @entity54 victim @entity53 's mansion			1
the father of four carved out his niche from a career in conventional property appraisal			0
after the 1992 @entity61 riots in @entity62 he was called in to assess the damage and found his calling , deciding to focus only on damaged property			0
' i love a challenge - the biggest , baddest , bring it on , ' mr @entity5 told the @entity68			1
' every day of the week , there are new places to go and new disasters			0
' stigmatized : @entity5 was called in to value the @entity72 , @entity73 mansion where police discovered the bodies of 39 members of the @entity78 cult grisly assignments : @entity5 has consulted on the house in @entity80 , @entity81 where @entity52 was killed media attention : the more notorious a case is , says @entity5 , the more a property 's value will be damaged , as in the case of @entity50 's condo he 's in hot demand due to an uncommon skill - set : @entity5 has the ability to adjust for for stigma as well as physical damage when he values a property			1
the @entity94 describes a stigmatized house as one ' that has been psychologically impacted by an event which occurred , or was suspected to have occurred , on the property , such event being one that has no physical impact of any kind			0
' television show ghost adventures recently featured a @entity106 mansion , the halls of which , they claimed , stalks a ' nasty , evil spirit			0
' this came as news to the property 's owner @entity111 who wanted to sue the @entity113 for damages for lost property value			0
apart from the physical damage from ghost - hunting vandals who broke into the home ( and performed satanic rituals in its rooms ) @entity111 had to account for the loss of value due to the stigma now attached to the house			2
who was he going to call ? natural disaster : @entity5 also consults on property damaged by other means , such as houses affected by @entity131 damage control : @entity5 's research on environmental catastrophes has taken him from @entity135 ( pictured ) to @entity136 @entity5 visited the home four times before making his final appraisal , according to the @entity68			1
ghost adventures claimed the house was the site of mob murders , though @entity5 found no evidence of any such thing			1
but that fact made no difference - the property had been stigmatized by the claims , so @entity5 made his valuation as though the house had played host to grisly murders			1
@entity111 eventually sold the house earlier this year , though the final figure of the damages he 's suing for remains confidential			2
terrorism : @entity5 was called in to consult on the @entity156 attacks in @entity157 @entity5 's skills are based on thorough research - he is uniquely qualified in his area of expertise , having traveled to every state in @entity48 , not to mention each continent in the world several times over , to observe the effects of disasters , terrorism , murder and suicide on @entity171 work has taken him to @entity136 , @entity172 , the @entity173 and the @entity174 , where he was searching for comparisons of properties damaged by terrorists			1
@entity5 told the @entity68 that near the city of @entity180 , a man threatened to kill him and his guide with a machine gun			2
before he could make good on his threats , an air - raid siren went off , a bomb exploded and machine - gun fire deafened him			0
' i hit my limit with @entity180 , ' he says			0
new path : @entity5 's first taste of appraising damaged property came after the 1992 @entity62 riots his meticulous research makes him the go - to guy for governments and organizations seeking put a figure on losses after mass disasters			1
@entity5 has consulted on @entity131 , the @entity200 in the @entity201 , the september 11 attacks at the @entity173 , and the @entity204 crash site in @entity205			1
he explained to today 's @entity206 that any reduction in value of a property due to stigma depends on the scope of the tragedy and the media attention it received			0
according to @entity5 , there is usually a 15 - to - 25 per cent decrease in value for two or three years after the event , which then diminishes over a one - to - 25 - year period			2
some cases are special , though			0
the @entity221 apartment building in which @entity222 lived and murdered his parents caused a mass exodus of the entire neighborhood			0
' @entity222 's crimes were so horrific that not only the building was stigmatized but also the neighborhood , and that 's very unusual , ' he says			0
' @entity229 went from 80 per cent to 20 per cent , as people in adjoining buildings wanted to leave the neighborhood			0
' the house was eventually demolished			0
value restored : the home where @entity53 was murdered by the infamous @entity54 was eventually sold two decades after the murder a seller is obliged to tell you if the roof leaks - but do they have to tell you about the dark event in the basement ? @entity5 advises real estate agents that disclosure is the best policy			1
more than 20 states have laws that clarify real - estate agents ' duty to disclose psychological stigma and protect sellers from liability			0
the statutes vary from state to state - @entity13 's requires sellers to disclose a murder , but only within three years of the crime , and there is no requirement to disclose other felonies or suicide			0
in any case , says @entity5 , all stigmas eventually fade			2
he says the owner of the house where @entity53 was so brutally murdered along with her unborn baby held onto the house for 20 years , then sold it at market value without any trouble at all .			1
