by @entity0 @entity2 @entity1 was a huge hit when she appeared on the very first series of @entity6 's @entity5 - but her star failed to rise in the @entity6 as @entity8 pulled out of a record deal with her			1
but @entity1 , 13 , from @entity11 , @entity12 has proved the music mogul wrong after becoming a star in @entity15			1
back in 2007 @entity8 promised the sweet , gap toothed girl he would make her Â£ 1 million after her rendition of @entity19 , but his record company pulled out of the deal at the last minute because of her age			1
@entity1 's @entity6 's @entity5 audition where she wowed judges with @entity19 but since then @entity1 has gone from strength to strength performing in front of sell - out crowds to an army of fans across the globe			1
now a teenager , she is preparing to tour @entity15 again in the summer in front of thousands in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1

@entity1 with fans at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity35 on april 25 ( l ) and at home in @entity11 ( r ) incredibly , she has no management company behind her with mother @entity56 , 44 , and father @entity57 , 46 , still handling all of her bookings			1
today @entity56 , a full - time mother , said : ' she 's come a long way - she 's a teenage girl now but she 's remained so grounded			2
' she can now play the piano and play the guitar and her dedication has paid off - she is massive in @entity15 , we just can not believe it			0
' her school life is still important and she is doing really well and we only perform in holiday times and she 's never been in such demand			2
' she 's a megastar in @entity15 but over half of her @entity40 views , which are well over a billion now , come from the @entity69			0
@entity1 first melted the hearts of the nation as a gap - toothed six - year - old in 2007 @entity1 wowed judges @entity8 and @entity74 , who were very impressed with her ' maybe that 's what is next for her - you just never know she might crack @entity69			1
i 'm so proud of her			0
' hopefully @entity8 realises now he perhaps should n't have let her go but we 're not bitter , it was probably the right decision at the time			1
' we are very thankful and amazed how far she has made it just by herself and we want her to keep her feet on the ground ' she is turning into a teenager but does n't really show an interest in boys yet , well not that she 's telling me anyway			0
' @entity1 has more than 158,000 @entity89 followers and most recently played to sell - out crowds in @entity35			2

@entity1 , who has a brother @entity105 , 20 , and a sister @entity104 , 19 , said : ' hopefully in the future i will be doing my own songs and i 'm practising my instruments all the time			2
' my friends at school are just normal , they treat me the same as everyone else , i do n't really know if i 'm famous or not			0
' i think it [ what happened with @entity8 ] was the right choice , i was too young to do a lot of stuff at that time			2
' i still watch @entity6 's @entity5 , i liked attraction [ @entity120 dance group who won last year ] , i thought they were amazing			0
' their audition made me cry			0
i think it does n't matter where you come from as long as you can enjoy it			0
