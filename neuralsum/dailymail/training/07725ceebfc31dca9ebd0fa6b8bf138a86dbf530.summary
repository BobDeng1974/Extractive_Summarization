by @entity0 we spoke yesterday about our last - wicket pair frustrating the @entity3 for maybe half an hour , so to manage three hours was pretty special			1
it felt like we were watching @entity6 history unfold and to watch @entity7 , who had never scored a first - class 50 , make 81 was amazing			1
he ’s been working on his batting with our assistant coach @entity10 and i ca n’t talk highly enough of the way he played here			2
superstition : @entity0 and his @entity16 team - mates were afraid to move from their seats on the balcony as @entity7 and @entity20 put on a record - breaking last - wicket stand of 198 at @entity22 on the front foot : @entity7 hit 81 as @entity16 established an unlikely lead in their first innings cricketers are a superstitious lot , so we decided at the start of the day that we were n’t going to move from our seats at all			1
the only exception was for toilet breaks but even then the pressure was on			2
you ’re allowed to nip out to the gents but only if you ’re back in time for the start of the next over			1
i ’ve been in that situation before , where someone does n’t make it back in time and then gets blamed if a wicket falls			1
the pressure of being an international sportsman comes in all shapes and sizes			0
@entity48 and @entity20 reach record heights applause : @entity16 captain @entity50 salutes @entity7 and @entity20 after their world record stand changed the course of the first test game changer : @entity20 's unbeaten 154 turned the match in @entity16 's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on we saw when @entity62 ’s last pair added 111 how easy it is to bat on this pitch , even if you ’re a tail - ender and especially when the ball goes old and there ’s no bounce in the surface			1
we saw @entity7 reaching 50 by charging @entity62 ’s opening bowler and hooking him in front of square , which just highlighted how poor this surface has been for @entity6			1
in the end , @entity7 was probably unlucky that his nick carried to slip			1
i ca n’t have been the only one in the ground who thought he might have been on his way to a maiden @entity81 ! batting i ’ve worked really hard on my batting since i got back from @entity83 and it ’s really pleasing that it seems to be paying off			0
@entity10 has played a big part and he ’s encouraged me to be attacking			0
i remember reading @entity87 say he always looked for a four early on and that ’s what i ’m trying to do			0
i ’ve added a little trigger movement too and feel like i ’ve got time to hit through the ball			2
collapses it does seem over the past year we ’ve been prone to some collapses and it ’s something we have to improve			0
it ’s a collective effort and there ’s no blame involved because the bowlers are part of the batting effort too			0
my knee with so many tests squeezed into such a short space of time anyone with half a cricket brain understands rotation could be on the agenda			2
hopefully the knee will be ok but let ’s be honest , if we keep bowling 160 overs an innings then none of the bowlers will get through the series			0
staying at home it ’s nice to be able to wake up in my own bed and it ’s always special playing at your home ground			0
it ’s definitely more friendly than @entity123 !			0
