@entity0 ’ miserable week ended with a third defeat on the bounce as the @entity4 manager was jeered by his own fans at @entity6 yesterday			1
@entity0 ’ team were beaten 2 - 1 at @entity6 by all - conquering @entity8 in the @entity9 on saturday , the defeat coming on the back of losses at @entity13 last weekend and @entity14 in the @entity15 in midweek			1
@entity4 are now 15 points behind @entity8 and seemingly out of the title race already			1
to make matters worse , sections of the @entity6 crowd briefly turned on @entity0 when he took off fans ’ favourite @entity22 midway through the second half			1
' there was n’t enough momentum			2
but the supporters are a big part of this , here			2
they are frustrated and i understand that			2
' they have given us great support and we are going through a difficult period at the moment			2
' @entity4 led early through a deflected striker from @entity53 international midfielder @entity51			1
but @entity8 equalised through @entity25 soon after as goal - line technology was used to rule that the defender ’s close range shot had crossed the line at the @entity59 end			1
@entity61 ’s team won the game in the second half through @entity64 but @entity4 were subsequently denied a penalty when referee @entity30 failed to spot that @entity25 had handled a shot from @entity28			1
@entity0 added : ' the technology has been great			1
you see the replay for the goal and it was over the line			2
@entity51 can celebrates putting @entity4 ahead after nine minutes with a deflected effort @entity73 stops @entity25 's effort but the ball goes over the line to make it 1 - 1 @entity64 smashes home his 10th goal of the season to make it 2 - 1 to @entity8 ' but it ’s bitterly disappointing that later there was a big decision in a big game and we did n’t get it			1
' our players gave everything and we should have got it			0
you have to see that			0
he had a clear look at it			0
maybe he needed help from his linesman			0
' but this is the situation we are at			0
we are not getting the rub of the green			0
it was a clear penalty and we should have got it			0
' and even @entity100 conceded that @entity4 should have been awarded a penalty , saying : ' we have had some not go our way , it evens itself out '			1
@entity0 was criticised in midweek for leaving out so many first team players for the game in @entity14			1
they all came back in to the team yesterday but to no avail			0
' the changes led to criticism and i can take that , ' added @entity0			2
' i have no issue with that			0
i did think it was unfair on some of the players who played but there we go			0
i would n’t do anything different			0
we just did n’t get the result			0
