by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 was only 14 years old when he was thrown into a relegation battle in @entity4 ’s @entity3 with his first club @entity5			1
unable to keep them up after a 15 - year run in the top flight the club that had taken a gamble on the slight - of - frame midfielder found themselves in the second division			0
the teenager was not about to let them down though			0
@entity1 led the team that got the @entity18 - based side back into the top division the following season scoring nine goals in 22 games and making @entity22 sit up and take notice of what was clearly going to be the next big thing			2
he made a slow start under @entity54 but when the @entity35 hero from @entity46 ’s 1986 success in @entity57 lost his job after a string of bad results @entity61 came in and decided to build his team around @entity1			1
in the 2009 - 10 season he scored nine goals in 38 games as @entity44 won the league			2
that was enough to earn him a move to @entity69 and with @entity70 guiding him he landed at @entity71 for 7.5m euros , despite interest from @entity73 and @entity74			2
he played in the @entity76 team that won the @entity77 in his first season in 2011 and he won three leagues in three seasons at @entity71 playing his way into @entity83 ’s @entity4 team making his debut in 2011			1
the success in @entity86 persuaded @entity32 to pay 45m euros for @entity1 in 2013 and in his first , and last season , he scored 10 goals in 38 games			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity90 before the @entity35 his @entity4 team - mate @entity88 picked him out to be a star of the tournament			1
that seemed like pals , compatriots and club team - mates looking out for one another at the time , but events in @entity38 proved otherwise as @entity1 became player of the tournament in all but name			0
tip : @entity32 and @entity4 team - mate @entity88 backed him to star at the @entity35 silverware : @entity1 won the @entity86 league title at @entity71 under @entity76 trio : @entity1 could line up alongside @entity107 and @entity108 in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation for @entity31 his stunning @entity35 , scoring six times in five games to win the @entity36 – including the goal of the tournament against @entity114 – was all the encouragement @entity31 needed to celebrate winning their tenth @entity116 by making him their big signing			1
president @entity119 was always going to wait to see which new star emerged in @entity38 before signing this season ’s ‘ @entity121 ’ and @entity1 became that player with a string of sensational displays , some post-knockout emotional interviews , and no shortage of charm			0
to say he made the right noises after the @entity35 would be an understatement			0
the tears were barely dry after @entity4 ’s exit against @entity38 when he declared : ‘ i prefer @entity31 to @entity134 ’			1
he then told @entity135 : ‘ i would go to @entity31 with my eyes closed			0
it would be a dream to play for them			0
the first time i went to the @entity141 i said to myself : “ i want to play here one day ”			0
’ the wheels were well and truly in motion and with @entity70 , the agent he shares with his new team - mate @entity107 , at the heart of negotiations the move went through with little or no resistance from @entity32 's @entity151 president @entity150			2
after seeing the @entity153 forward line of @entity108 , @entity154 and @entity107 shoot their way to @entity116 glory aided and abetted by @entity157 and @entity158 last season all that remains now is for @entity160 to find a way of fitting in all his superstars			1
conundrum : real coach @entity160 could have trouble finding space for all his star names @entity158 and @entity168 could face uncertain futures at @entity31 following @entity1 's arrival @entity1 is happiest in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 playing as the @entity171			2
he could line up between @entity107 and @entity108 in a formidable second line of attack behind @entity154 and in front of midfield pairing @entity175 and @entity157			1
that will be the preference of president @entity119			0
all @entity160 and the club ’s director general @entity180 will have to do then is find a home for , or a way of keeping happy , @entity184 , @entity168 , @entity185 , @entity158 and @entity186 … just another summer at @entity31			0
long - term commitment : @entity1 has signed a six - year deal with @entity31			1

@entity1 has signed for @entity31 for a fee in excess of *£* *60m*
the @entity4 forward won the @entity36 at the @entity35
but he began *career* *fighting* relegation with @entity5 in @entity4 aged 14
then had successful spells with @entity44 , @entity71 and @entity32 before @entity31
@entity1 could line up alongside @entity107 and @entity108
