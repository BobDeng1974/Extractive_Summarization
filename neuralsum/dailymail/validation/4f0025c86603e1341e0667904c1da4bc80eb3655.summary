kidney stones are very common — larger stones often need surgery to remove them			1
@entity4 , 46 , a divorced father of two who lives near @entity6 , came up with a novel way to help surgeons during his operation , as he tells @entity10			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) did not realise he was suffering from kidney stones until he collapsed from an unrelated condition last november the patient my kidney stone took me by surprise — i only discovered i had one after i collapsed with an unrelated condition last november			1
i run a 3d printing company which makes bones out of plaster of @entity20 for surgeons to use as practice models for complex orthopaedic operations			1
during a presentation to surgeons , i was suddenly floored by an agonising pain radiating across my lower stomach			2
i was taken to @entity27 , where i was shocked to learn i had an appendicitis			0
my appendix was removed that night			2
however , scans also revealed a large stone in my right kidney			1
despite its size — 3.5cm by 2.5cm — it had given me none of the usual symptoms , such as pain or blood in the urine			0
apparently it had developed because i had a kidney infection , which i did n’t even realise			2
the doctors said it might grow even bigger , so i was told i ’d need further surgery to cut out the stone			2
it was a lot to take in while also facing having my appendix removed			2
but i ’ve had operations on my knees , back and for hernias , and after my appendix agony i did n’t want even more pain from a growing stone			0
after they removed my appendix , i began wondering whether 3d technology might be helpful with my kidney operation			1
i discussed it with my consultant , urological surgeon @entity57 , suggesting that a life - size model of my kidney with the stone inside might give him accurate information about my operation			1
after he collapsed , @entity4 ( pictured ) was taken to @entity27 where he was diagnosed with appendicitis and had his appendix removed he ’d heard of @entity65 being used in orthopaedic operations such as hip replacements but , as far as he knew , it had n’t been used with this kind of procedure			1
he agreed it might help — anything allowing a surgeon to visualise the area in more detail could only make surgery quicker and more accurate			1
i was n’t due to have the stone removed until january this year , so , after taking two weeks off work to recover from the appendix operation , i began work on the model			1
the machine we use for 3d printing , known as an @entity84 , used images of my kidney from ct scans to recreate a model , slice by slice , using layers of plaster of @entity20 half a millimetre thick			1
@entity4 used images of his kidney from the ct scan to recreate a model , slice by slice using plaster of @entity20 ( pictured )			1
this allows the surgeon to complete surgery faster and more accurately these layers were then laid on top of each other			1
the model was made in three coloured parts , so it could be taken apart like @entity109 pieces			0
this way , mr @entity57 could work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments			0
this planning can reduce operation times because it means less chance of having to rely on trial and error			0
the model took four hours to make and i was astonished when i saw the finished product — particularly the size of the stone			0
i could n’t understand how something that big had n’t caused me trouble			0
when i woke from the three - hour operation , i was a bit sore but was walking around within hours			0
i was in hospital for five days and had the stitches from my tiny wound taken out two weeks later			0
the replica of his kidney that @entity4 ( pictured ) created , allowed mr @entity57 to work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments the soreness lasted a few days , but painkillers helped , and i was back in the office within ten days			1
i do n’t know whether that ’s because of the kidney model , but i like to think so			1
i ’m planning to make more models for mr @entity57 — for ten patients with kidney stones and ten with cancer			1
they cost £ 123 — but if it shortens operations and therefore reduces infection risk , it could be of massive benefit to the health service and save money in the long run			0
the surgeon @entity57 is a consultant urological surgeon and specialist in endourology at @entity27			0
kidney stones occur when waste products removed from the blood form crystals , which over time form hard stones			1
if they ’re not completely blocking tubes in and around the kidneys , they should pass naturally within five weeks			0
but larger stones can get stuck — they can be extremely painful and lead to infections			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) is now planning to make more models for mr @entity57 , costing £ 123 a piece @entity4 ’s was a large stone that would have been hard to pass and he needed an operation , a keyhole procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy			1
it ’s quite complex surgery — there is a risk of bleeding because the kidney has such a rich blood supply			1
in up to 5 per cent of cases , patients need a transfusion			0
a ct scan and x-rays are taken beforehand to pinpoint the exact location of a kidney stone			1
but i felt having a 3d model as well would give us even more detail : i ’d be able to hold the model , take it apart , see the exact location of the stone and plan the precise angle of our surgical instruments			1
i kept the model throughout the surgery to consolidate what i was seeing on screen			2
we started the procedure by passing a camera — a cystoscope — through the urethra and up into the bladder			0
this meant i could see the stone on a screen			0
then @entity4 was turned on his front and i made a 1cm incision on his right - hand side , just below the ribcage in his back			2
then we punctured the kidney with a fine needle , which helped create a tract , or tunnel , for us to access the kidney			0
this was done under x-ray guidance			0
next , i passed a hollow tube known as a dilator into this tract , to enlarge it , so we could then insert a telescope , allowing images to be produced on screen			0
then , using ultrasound energy pumped through a tiny probe , we broke the stone into fragments , before sucking them out using a pump inserted through the small puncture in the back			0
throughout the procedure , having the model as a point of reference was very useful , allowing me to visualise in @entity65 what was happening at each stage			0
typical risks of the procedure include excess bleeding , as well as injuring the structures surrounding the kidney , but having a model helps minimise risks			2
@entity4 has also created a model of a kidney with a cancerous tumour ( left )			1
the right - hand picture shows the model of @entity4 's own kidney stone i hope this technology soon becomes widely available			1
i carry out around 250 kidney - stone procedures a year , around 30 of which are large and complex			0
the model could speed up procedures like this by 30 minutes as it will take less time to plan how to access the kidney			2
this in turn could reduce infection time and complication rates			0
it could be helpful when removing tumours , too			0
it ’s also useful to show the patient a model when explaining the procedure , and it could also help in training the surgeons of tomorrow			2
@entity273 ? ‘ there ’s no doubt that having a model to study before surgery and then to refer to a during an operation can only increase its success , ’ says @entity274 , a consultant urologist at the @entity275 in @entity276			2
‘ kidney stones — especially large ones — can involve fairly complicated surgery			1
and , with keyhole surgery , when you are operating with a telescope , you need to plan in a methodical fashion beforehand			0
a model like this is certainly the way forward for this sort of surgery			2
’ the surgery costs between £ 10,000 and £ 12,000 privately , and is a similar cost to the @entity297 .			0

kidney stones are very common and often larger ones need to be removed
@entity4 , 46 , has come up with a unique way to help surgeons
he used images of his kidney from ct scans to recreate a 3d model
this lets the surgeon to see the area in more detail and speeds up surgery
