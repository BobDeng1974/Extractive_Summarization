a hapless police officer scrambled a force helicopter after spotting a ' raid ' on a scrap metal yard only to find that the suspect was actually a scarecrow wearing a high - visibility jacket			1
the pc was on the hunt for a gang responsible for a string of metal thefts when he saw a ‘ man acting suspiciously ’ on top of a pile of scrap			1
thinking the suspect was a lookout for the gang , he called for back - up and scrambled the police helicopter to give him aerial support			1
who 's the dummy , now ? a pc scrambled a force helicopter after spotting a ' raid ' on a scrap metal yard , but discovered later that the ' suspect ' was actually a scarecrow ( not pictured ) in a high - visibility vest ( file images ) d'oh ! the red - faced pc had to radio @entity30 to tell them to stand the police helicopter down after his back - up team established that the ' man ' was just a dummy ( file picture ) a specialist team of traffic officers also turned up armed with a high - powered zoom camera , which officers trained on the ‘ suspect ’ - who was ‘ standing his ground ’			1
it was only when traffic officers got a ‘ good look ’ at the suspect they realised it was a scarecrow , ironically put in place by scrap metal bosses to ward off thieves			1
the red - faced pc had to radio @entity30 to tell them to stand the police helicopter down and confirm that a crime was not in progress			0
the bungle , which took place in @entity59 last month , was revealed in @entity61 magazine today , but spared the officer his blushes by not naming him			0
the magazine stated : ' an officer from @entity59 was investigating a series of thefts from scrap yards			0
' the offenders had narrowly escaped the officer several nights previously and he was intent on finding the culprits			0
case of mistaken identity : the pc was on the hunt for a gang responsible for a string of metal thefts when he saw a ' man acting suspiciously ' on top of a pile of scrap ( file picture ) ' this led to the officer giving a lot of passing attention to the area over the next few night shifts in an attempt to apprehend the persons responsible			1
' late one night , he was passing the area when he spotted a figure dressed in a high - visibility jacket stood on top of the tip. ' the magazine said that the officer believed the man was a ‘ lookout ’ and was ‘ clearly not supposed to be on the site ’			1
it added : ' the officer called for backup from the force helicopter and a traffic unit came to assist with a zoom lens to get a closer look			1
' upon this closer inspection , it was discovered that the lookout was a scarecrow wearing a high - visibility vest			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity61 said : ' we are unable to find details of the incident , or confirm whether it even occurred , as the information published by the magazine does not contain specifics and is from an anonymous source			0
' ' crime in @entity59 is down by 9 per cent thanks to the dedication of our officers			0
' in @entity125 , two officers found themselves cursing a similar bungle when they were called out to rescue a soaking wet pensioner who turned out to be a scarecrow wearing a straw hat			1
two pcs were on their way home from a nightshift in @entity134 when a call came in from an off - duty sergeant saying he had spotted a pensioner struggling against the elements during a particularly violent storm			0
the sergeant told @entity30 that he had seen the hunched @entity140 holding a walking stick as he plodded through the driving rain in fields near the village of @entity145 at 6.30am , seven miles away from @entity134 , last month			2
@entity146 woes : a police sergeant was left red - faced after despatching two pcs to find a lost pensioner , who turned out be this scarecrow which had been entered into a village competition the two pcs were re-routed to the village to ' track down ' the lost pensioner			2
but when they found a scarecrow wearing a straw hat , which was one of the entries in an annual village competition			0
the fuming pcs radioed back to @entity30 to tell them they were ' going home ' and to tell the sarge to ' go to @entity163 ' , it was revealed in @entity61 magazine			0
a police source , who asked not to be named , said : ' the two officers were not too happy with their sergeant			0
' they were looking forward to the end of their shift , but instead ended up trudging through the fields in the driving rain only to find a scarecrow staring back at them			2
