by @entity0 , @entity1 the @entity2 at @entity3 attracted 26,059 fewer spectators than when the tournament was played on the @entity7 links in 2006			1
a total of 202,917 fans watched @entity11 's triumph during the week , down on record figures of 228,976 when @entity13 won eight years earlier			1
numbers were down on practice days and each day of competition , although perhaps surprisingly the biggest single drop occurred on friday , with 43,183 spectators at @entity19 , down 7,343 from 2006			1
it is not clear whether sunday 's figure of 42,149 , down 2,008 on eight years ago , included the spectator who was ejected on the 16th hole after heckling @entity11 during the final round			2
' he was giving me grief all day , actually , ' @entity11 said			2
' i sort of put up with it for the first 15 holes and then he deliberately coughed on my downswing on the 16th tee			0
' i still hit a great drive but i heard it halfway down and i knew who it was			0
so i turned around and got him chucked out , thankfully			0
' champion : the @entity54 holds aloft the claret jug to the fans who did make it to @entity19 celebration : the numbers were still a long way up on last year 's @entity24 , and they enjoyed @entity11 's win video the open championship : final round the figures are still a major improvement on last year , when ' just ' 142,036 spectators were at @entity67 to see @entity69 's victory			1
the @entity32 said a heatwave could have contributed to the low attendance , although ticket prices of Â£ 75 were also blamed .			0

26,000 fewer *people* saw @entity11 win than @entity13 in 2006
