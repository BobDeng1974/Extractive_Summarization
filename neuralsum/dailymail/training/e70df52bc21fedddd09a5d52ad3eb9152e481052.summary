pesticides have been found in fresh salmon sold by leading supermarkets			2
farmed salmon from @entity4 and @entity5 is hugely popular as a healthy oily fish			2
however , the production process involves dousing the fish , reared in cages moored in the sea , in chemicals to kill parasitic lice			1
they are also given a protein feed , created from small waste fish which can be contaminated with chemicals from the environment – including @entity18 and its by - products			1
fresh salmon sold in five major supermarkets was found to contain trace levels of pesticide @entity18 trace levels of these chemicals were found in fish sold by @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity18 was banned for use almost 30 years ago because of its risk to human health			1
a recently published study suggested a link between @entity18 , an associated by - product compound called pp - @entity36 and alzheimer ’s disease in the elderly			1
official studies show farmed salmon is more likely to carry traces of chemical pesticides than any other food type			2
the @entity44 , which is overseen by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , tested farmed salmon and trout sold in the supermarkets			0
the figures from 2013 , which have just been released through a @entity51 request , found the pesticides pp - @entity36 , @entity53 and @entity54 , as well as other chemicals , in fish sold by supermarkets			1
@entity53 , a powerful pesticide , was banned in the 1970s			0
it has been linked to health problems such as @entity61 ’s , breast cancer , and immune , reproductive , and nervous system damage			0
@entity54 is a pesticide used on farmed salmon to kill off lice that live on the captive fish			1
the results revealed two samples of rainbow trout fillets from the @entity71 sold by @entity28 tested positive for @entity53 , while salmon sold by @entity29 also tested positive			1
@entity74 salmon fillets from @entity4 were found to contain traces of pp - @entity36			2
the production process of salmon involves covering the fish in chemicals to kill parasitic lice			1
the creatures are also given a protein feed which can be contaminated with chemicals from the environment - including @entity18 and its by - products the chemicals accumulate in the fat of the fish			1
salmon which is farmed is far fattier than the wild fish and therefore more likely to carry chemical traces			2
the details were revealed by @entity93 , director of the @entity94 , who is a long standing critic of fish farms			0
he said : ‘ farmed salmon is the most contaminated food on the supermarket shelf			0
it should carry a @entity100 health warning			0
‘ @entity102 farmers can decontaminate fish feed – this has been known for decades but the industry has refused to take action			2
’ government experts have ruled that the chemical levels are so low as to not pose a risk , say the @entity45			0
the @entity45 added that it ‘ does detect and report occasional residues of substances used to control lice on fish			0
when used for this purpose these substances are regulated as veterinary medicines			0
’ the @entity117 , which speaks for food stores , said : ‘ the @entity45 has confirmed the microscopic residues present no issues for consumers			0
‘ the chemical banned since the 1980s is still present in minute levels in the environment and the survey is to assess the levels present			0

trace levels found in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 salmon
@entity102 production process involves dousing fish in chemicals to kill lice
@entity136 also given protein feed which can contain @entity18 and other by - products
@entity18 banned for use 30 years ago because of risk to human health
some studies suggest link between *ddt* and alzheimer *'s* disease in elderly
