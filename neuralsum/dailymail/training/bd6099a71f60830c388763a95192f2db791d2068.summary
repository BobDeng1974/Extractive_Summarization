by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:36 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 21 october 2013 voters would rather see @entity3 in charge of the economy than @entity6 , a new poll reveals in a blow to the @entity11 mayor ’s political ambitions			1
almost two thirds of people would not trust a @entity15 government led by mr @entity6 to take the right decisions to manage the economic recovery			2
the findings lay bare the challenge he would face in proving that the country ’s best known political joker was also capable of taking tough decisions for the country			0
challenge : @entity6 has been widely tipped as a future prime minister , but voters are not convinced the economy would be safe in his hands the coalition is expected to be boosted by growth figures on friday , which are expected to show the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2013			1
mr @entity34 and chancellor @entity35 have been bolstered by the sense that the recovery is gaining momentum but warn that @entity39 is not out of the woods yet			0
mr @entity6 , long tipped as a future @entity15 leader , sought to present himself as a more serious political figure with a five - day visit to @entity44			0
talking up immigration and investment in @entity11 , he backed @entity48 lessons in @entity39 schools and urged the @entity39 government to give the go ahead for a new airport in the south east			2
but attempts to sell @entity39 's relationship with @entity44 misfired with a @entity56 analogy which lacked magic			0
the @entity11 mayor was talking up how closer links with @entity44 , claiming it was like the wizard 's first girlfriend ' @entity63 - who is a @entity44 overseas student at @entity64 '			1
however the boast quickly unravelled , with fans of the @entity68 series pointing out that @entity63 was @entity39 , and their relationship fell apart soon after starting			0
in a poll commissioned to mark the fifth anniversary of the news that the @entity39 economy plunged into recession , mr @entity6 has not emerged as its saviour			2
high flier : the @entity11 mayor took a spectacular helicopter ride over @entity78 as he arrived in the city as part of his trade mission to @entity44 last week fears : almost two thirds of people fear mr @entity6 can not be trusted with the economy just seven per cent of voters said they would trust mr @entity6 ' a great deal ' with the economy and 20 per cent ' a fair amount ' , compared to 12 per cent and 23 per cent who backed a @entity15 government led by mr @entity34			1
just over half of people ( 58 per cent ) said they would not trust mr @entity34 with the economy , compared to almost two thirds ( 62 per cent ) who said the same of the @entity11 mayor			1
it means mr @entity34 had a net score of -23 per cent , much better than -35 per cent for a @entity99 government led by mr @entity6			0
a @entity101 government led by @entity3 had a net rating of -32 per cent , also better than mr @entity6			1
the next preferred option was a power - sharing deal between mr @entity34 's @entity15 and @entity106 's @entity105			2
coalition : labour leader @entity3 ( left ) is more trusted on the economy than mr @entity6 , but voters would trust him less if he went into coalition with @entity105 leader @entity106 voters were less impressed by a @entity110 with @entity112 leading the @entity105 , with only a net rating of -44 per cent			1
a @entity101 - @entity105 coalition between mr @entity3 and mr @entity106 had a net trust rating of -53 per cent , the worst of all options put to the people polled			1
the @entity119 poll was commissioned lobbying and media relations firm @entity122			0
@entity123 , managing director of @entity122 , said : ‘ on the 5th anniversary of the start recession we wanted to see who the @entity39 public trusts most to lead us into a recovery , and the results are not encouraging for any of the contenders			0
‘ there is a hint that local politicians seem to , “ get it ” a little more than the national leadership contenders but clearly all politicians have work to do when it comes to inspiring confidence in their economic policies			0

new poll reveals people would rather trust @entity101 's @entity3
blow for @entity11 mayor who *harbours* ambitions to be @entity99 *pm*
voters most fear a @entity152 between @entity3 and @entity106
figures this week likely to show economy grew by 0.7 *%* july - *september*
