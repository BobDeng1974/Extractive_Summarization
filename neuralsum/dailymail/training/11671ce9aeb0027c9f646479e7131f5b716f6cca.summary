by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:26 est , 10 february 2014 it was a moment she had dreamed of since she was a girl and saw her claim @entity6 ’s first medal in a snow event at the @entity8 in 90 years			1
but for many , @entity10 ’s bronze in the snowboarding slopestyle final was marred by the @entity13 commentary			1
the corporation was forced to apologise after more than 300 viewers complained			2
commentators @entity16 and @entity18 were labelled ‘ immature idiots ’ for whooping and cheering as @entity20 competed in @entity21 , @entity22 , on sunday			1
apology : hundreds of viewers complained that the @entity13 had spoiled @entity10 's @entity26 bronze medal success and branded commentators including snowboarder @entity28 ' puerile and hyperactive ' team : @entity13 commentators @entity16 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) were also in the commentary box clowning around : @entity28 , pictured with fellow snowboarder @entity31 , was invited to join the commentary box after she failed to get through to the event final the pair , who were joined by @entity20 ’s friend and fellow snowboarder @entity28 , repeatedly talked over each other and appeared to celebrate when her @entity39 rival @entity40 fell , ensuring 33 - year - old @entity20 a medal			1
at one point @entity42 yelled ‘ go on the @entity20 ! ’ , while @entity18 said ‘ i ca n’t look , someone else commentate ’ as she was about to start her run			2
when miss @entity40 fell , the @entity13 team erupted into cheers and miss @entity28 screamed : ‘ @entity20 gets bronze			1
can i stand on my chair now ? ’ the cheering became so loud that @entity42 herself remarked : ‘ whoa , are we supposed to do that ? probably not			0
’ in one exchange as @entity20 , from @entity55 , waited for her score , @entity16 said : ‘ i can feel my pulse in my lower intestine			2
’ @entity18 replied : ‘ that ’s not your pulse , @entity63 ’ crude : mr @entity16 also referred to @entity26 hero @entity64 's reaction to winning the bronze - telling viewers she ' had a face that can help bread rise ' shock : @entity10 realises her parents , who she believed were at home , were in the crowd as she competed , pictured left			1
she immediately rushed over to give them a hug , pictured right a total of 303 complained to the @entity13 about the coverage			2
writing on the @entity13 ’s own @entity81 messageboard , one viewer said : ‘ @entity82 , the @entity20 medal overshadowed by immature idiots			1
’ another criticised the ‘ shrieking with joy at the fall of a @entity89 athlete ’			0
a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ this was a truly historic occasion for @entity93 and the commentary team were understandably very excited			2
however , we acknowledge that on occasion this excitement got the better of them			0
’ @entity99 @entity98 took gold in the event with 95.25 , ahead of @entity103 ’s @entity102 on 92.50			0
the three medal winners shouted their delight and hugged as the final competitor failed to match their scores			0
success : miss @entity10 beams as she reaches the foot of the slope @entity20 had previously been world champion and had won three gold medals at the @entity112 but had never previously competed at the @entity8 as the snowboard slopestyle event was making its @entity26 debut			1
miss @entity10 was the oldest competitor in the final by six years and had not even picked up a snowboard until she was 17 when she visited a dry ski slope			1
and she had been forced to put her preparations for the games on hold over @entity121 after she suffered a concussion during training			0
she confessed that she has slept with the medal under her pillow and that the reality of her win was only just ' starting to sink in a little bit			1
' tumble : despite repeatedly telling viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were , the presenters distastefully cheered when @entity20 's main competitor @entity132 suffered a fall but her victory has been slightly overshadowed by criticism of the coverage of the event			1
fuming viewers took to @entity138 to vent their frustration at the commentary team - with some admitting they had been forced to switch the sound off			0

one viewer said : ' it was awful , you would not have expected this in the heyday of @entity13 coverage , could you imagine @entity199 commentators reacting like that ? ' @entity213 added : ' so just popped online to see people ’s reactions to the commentary , i can not believe i ’m alone in finding them unbearably annoying			1
' they ’re like hungover teenagers , talking over each other and yelping			0
it ’s giving me a headache - i came here to zone out and watch people in hyper trendy fluffy clothes do cool stuff in snow			0
' winners : @entity102 , @entity98 and @entity10 pose on the podium at their medal ceremony apres - ski ? @entity233 snowboarder @entity10 tweeted this , suggesting she might have gone out celebrating after her win			1
