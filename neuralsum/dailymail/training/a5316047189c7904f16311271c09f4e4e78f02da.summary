@entity1 press secretary @entity0 wound up with egg on his face monday as he told reporters that president @entity5 first learned from a tv news report that his @entity7 was denying medical care to vets with secret off - the - books - waiting lists			1
but new evidence emerged this morning that his transition team was notified five years ago about how @entity17 medical centers ' official wait - list times bore little resemblance to reality and risked denying military heroes critical health care			1
the @entity22 reported monday that waiting times at veterans ' medical facilities were known to be wildly inaccurate at the end of the @entity28 administration			2
by the time @entity5 's transition team got a post-election briefing from the @entity17 at the end of 2008 , scheduling failures were already reaching a critical point			1
the newspaper received a copy of that briefing through a @entity38 request			0
@entity5 has come under fire before for saying he was made aware of scandal - worthy shortcomings in his own administration by watching television , including the @entity46 tea party - targeting scandal that rocked @entity48 12 months ago and the @entity49 saga that has tainted his @entity50 for years			1
' that was also the @entity1 's excuse today for not acting to improve veterans ' care sooner the @entity73 and other veterans advocacy groups are hopping mad about an under - the - table waiting list scandal that appears to have cost dozens of lives in just one @entity80 medical center suicides : psychiatrist @entity83 told @entity84 on monday that she believes a @entity86 @entity85 ? s appointment system was so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives a @entity90 reporter asked @entity0 on monday when the president was ' first made aware ... of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times ' at @entity17 medical centers			1
' you mean the specific allegations , ' @entity0 asked , ' that i think were reported first by your news network out of @entity99 , i believe ? ' ' we learned about them through the reports			1
i will double check if that is not the case			0
but that is when we learned about them and that is when i understand @entity108 learned about them , and he immediately took the action that he has taken			0
' after the @entity49 scandal broke , @entity5 responded to national outrage in an interview broadcast by @entity90 's @entity114 on october 12 , 2011 , similarly saying he was out of the loop until he turned on his television			1
' there have been problems , you know , ' the president said then			0
' i heard on the news about this story that – @entity49 , where allegedly guns were being run into @entity124 , and @entity125 knew about it , but did n't apprehend those who had sent [ the guns ]			2
' a few months into his presidency , @entity5 's @entity1 approved an unannounced @entity131 flyover by @entity132 , with a fighter jet following closely , in order to capture a photograph of the iconic plane over the @entity137			1
some buildings were evacuated and emergency phone lines were jammed as panicked @entity131 feared a terror attack was imminent			0
' it was a mistake , ' the president said on april 28 , 2009 , the day after the flight			2
' it was something we found out about along with all of you			0
and it will not happen again			0
' last year on may 14 , @entity0 told reporters that @entity5 had learned about his @entity50 seizing two months ' worth of @entity153 journalists ' phone records ' from news reports yesterday , on the road			1
' ' we do n't have any independent knowledge of that , ' @entity0 insisted			2
that punt came just one day after @entity5 himself told the @entity48 press corps during a joint press conference with @entity164 prime minister @entity163 that he was in the dark – until it hit news reports – that the @entity46 had targeted conservative nonprofit groups for special inquisitions when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
' i first learned about it from the same news reports that i think most people learned about this , ' he said in the @entity175 of the @entity1 on may 13 , 2013			1
' i think it was on friday			0
and this is pretty straightforward			0
' ' i 've got no patience with it , ' @entity5 said moments later			2
' i will not tolerate it			0
and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this			0
' human face : this month @entity187 veteran @entity186 was buried in @entity188 , @entity189			0
his widow @entity190 , third from left , believes the @entity7 health system should have done more to help him as he struggled with @entity192			2
he was shot to death by one of their children in april after he threatened to kill the entire family in 2011 @entity5 told @entity90 that he first ' heard on the news about & @entity49 , where allegedly guns were being run into @entity124 , and @entity125 knew about it ' the president told reporters in 2009 that he found out along with reporters that his administration has approved an unannounced @entity132 flyover in @entity131 that spooked commuters and lit up 911 phone lines with terror - attack fears @entity1 adviser @entity208 told sunday morning talk show audiences the following weekend that @entity5 was first informed ' when it came out in the news			1
' a year later , accused @entity46 targeting instigator @entity212 has been held in contempt of @entity215 and her fate rests with attorney general @entity217			2
a criminal investigation in the @entity50 , which has issued no findings , is being managed by an attorney who donated thousands of dollars to @entity5 's political campaigns			1
@entity5 's reputation for using the news media as his own coal - mine canary reached comic proportions that week when ' @entity227 ' host @entity226 carped that ' i would n’t be surprised if president @entity5 learned @entity230 had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television			1
' some @entity233 are fearing déjà vu as the @entity17 medical scandal gathers steam			1
' this is becoming a pattern , ' a senior @entity233 @entity238 aide told @entity241 on monday			0
' the president supposedly learns about it while channel - surfing , tells us how outraged he is , and then what ? buries it ? ' @entity7 secretary @entity248 is under fire as his agency 's health system seems to be coming apart at the seams and the @entity1 claims it did n't know ' that might wash with the tea party , but not with veterans			1
no one around here is inclined to let that happen			0
' the @entity7 briefing given to @entity5 's transition team after his first presidential election victory warned specifically that its own medical appointment scheduling practices were putting lives in danger			1
' this is not only a data integrity issue in which [ @entity85 ] reports unreliable performance data , ' the transition report read ; ' it affects quality of care by delaying – and potentially denying — deserving veterans timely care			2
' it also recommended a series of tests that would compare doctor appointments in veterans ' official medical records with appointment times recorded in the @entity17 's computer system			1
as the @entity17 scandal gathers momentum , doctors are beginning to put a human face on the tragedy			2
dr. @entity83 , a whistle - blowing psychiatrist , told the @entity84 on monday that she believes a @entity86 @entity85 where she once worked had an appointment system so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives			0
bureaucrats , she said , ' do n't really experience what the doctors and nurses are experiencing , which is the suffering and the pain and the death			0
' @entity83 explained that her patients often had to wait months for follow - up appointments after she prescribed antidepressant medications that require check - ups after 10 days			0
some could n't wait out their psychological pain and committed suicide			0
@entity302 @entity301 resigned on friday a day after telling a congressional committee that he was aware of a 2010 memo warning about the problems , which materialized in a @entity80 , @entity17 medical center when as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting critical care			1
computer records indicated that the vets were not on a waiting list at all			0
@entity0 hinted monday that @entity5 is likely to address the new scandal			2
' i 'm sure you 'll hear from him at some point on this issue soon , ' he said .			0

@entity1 press secretary @entity0 said the president did n't know about *explosive* @entity7 scandal until he saw news reports
earlier in the day a report emerged showing the @entity17 itself warned @entity5 's transition team about it after the 2008 election
@entity5 and his *surrogates* have claimed he learned of several other scandals from broadcast or print news stories
they include @entity49 , the @entity46 's targeting of tea parties and a @entity50 seizure of two months of @entity153 phone records
@entity17 medical centers stand accused of *keeping* secret off - the - books waiting lists in order to cook the books and boost performance stats
as many as 40 veterans died in @entity99 when they were denied critical care because their names did n't appear on official waiting lists
