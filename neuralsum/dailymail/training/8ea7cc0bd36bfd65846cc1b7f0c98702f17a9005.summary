by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 4 july 2013 reading at any time of life could help preserve your memory into old age , researchers claim			0
they found activities which promote mental stimulation such as reading books and doing crosswords at any age could be linked to a slower rate of decline in brain power			1
it is the latest evidence that people who exercise their grey cells are protected against mental decline			1
dr @entity19 said : ‘ our study suggests that exercising your brain by taking part in activities such as these across a person ’s lifetime , from childhood through old age , is important for brain health in old age			2
’ keeping the mind alive : a new study has found that people who stimulate their brain by frequently reading had a slower rate of decline in brain power ( stock image ) doctors have long held that keeping your brain active – especially in later years – could be the best insurance against developing @entity42 ’s and other forms of dementia			1
in @entity46 , around 820,000 people have dementia , with most suffering from @entity42 ’s			0
previous research has found regular exercise can cut the risk of developing dementia , while other studies suggest keeping the brain active by doing crosswords , playing cards and computer work			0
the study involved 294 people over the age of 55 who were given cognitive tests every six years until their deaths at an average age of 89			0
they also answered a questionnaire about whether they read books , wrote or participated in other activities linked to memory stimulation during childhood , adolescence , middle age and at their current age			0
exercising the mind : other activities which promote mental stimulation , such as crossword puzzles , also help slow the decline of brain power after they died , their brains were examined for evidence of physical signs of dementia , such as lesions			1
the study found people who did mentally stimulating activities both early and late in life had a slower rate of decline in memory compared to those who did not do any such activities across their lifetime			1
the study found that even adjusting for factors such as dementia , those who had a record of participating in such activities had a rate of cognitive decline estimated at 15 per cent slower than those who did not			2
dr @entity19 , from @entity110 in @entity111 , said : ‘ based on this , we should n’t underestimate the effects of everyday activities , such as reading and writing , on our children , ourselves and our parents or grandparents			0
’ the study found the rate of decline was reduced by 32 per cent in people with frequent mental activity in later life , compared to people with average mental activity			1
the rate of decline of those with infrequent activity was 48 per cent faster than those with average activity , says a report in the medical journal @entity128			0
dr @entity129 , head of research at @entity131 , said : ‘ there is increasing evidence suggesting that mental activity may help protect against cognitive decline , but the underlying reasons for this remain unclear			0
‘ by examining donated brain tissue this study has shed more light on this complex question , and the results lend weight to the theory that mental activity may provide a level of ‘ ‘ cognitive reserve ’ ’ , helping the brain resist some of the damage from diseases such as @entity42 ’s			1
’ dr @entity150 , head of research at the @entity152 , said : ‘ this study finds that demanding mental activity can help protect your memory later in life , but it ’s important to note this is n’t the same as protecting against dementia			2

@entity164 or doing crosswords at any age could slow decline in brain power
study found decline is cut by 32 *%* with frequent mental activity in later life
suggests exercising our grey cells is best protection against @entity42 *'s*
