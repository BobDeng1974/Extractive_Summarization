a couple 's dream wedding in @entity2 was left in ruins after a series of catastrophic errors with their booking			1
@entity7 , 28 , was overjoyed when her fiancée @entity8 , 45 , popped the question on @entity10 and suggested that they tie the knot in the @entity13			1
but their hopes for a beautiful wedding were dashed after a number of errors were made after booking with their provider , @entity21 , which forced them to abandon their big day			0
but their holiday was cancelled when @entity21 announced that the hotel had been closed			0
bride - to - be @entity38 , who works as a carer , eventually found another location in @entity2 , the @entity41 hotel			1
she thought that it would be perfect , even though it would cost the couple more			2
but luck was n't on their side as those plans were also ruined			2
the travel agent 's promises of a date for the wedding failed to materialise and the wedding department at the hotel knew nothing of their booking			0
second option : the wedding department at the @entity59 hotel knew nothing of their booking @entity38 and @entity8 were then kept in limbo for six months but with one month to go until the original date and four failed options later , the couple were forced to forget their big day			1
disappointed : ms @entity7 's experience left her so stressed that she is now battling depression @entity38 , who is mum to eight - year - old @entity68 , said : ' i am completely devastated that our big day has been completely ruined			1
' i cried and cried in the travel agents			0
i felt as though we had no other choice than to cancel the entire wedding			0
i spent £ 250 on my wedding dress and was absolutely thrilled with it			1
i could n't wait for @entity8 to see me walk down the aisle in the dress of my dreams , but now i have had to put it away in the closet at my mum 's house			1
' i was over the moon when @entity8 proposed , it was so romantic , it was a perfect @entity10 present and we were desperate to get married abroad and in 2014			1
' now the thought of getting married does n't feel exciting any more			0
it 's not the occasion i had always dreamed of			0
' the fourth and most expensive option was ruled out when the unhappy couple 's bridesmaid and best man could not afford to attend and were then hit by a bereavement			0
@entity38 complained to the tour operator who have refunded her the £ 3,800 that the family paid for the holiday and the wedding ceremony			0
but she claims that she was not given a reasonable excuse for the wedding date not being confirmed or a realistic alternative option by @entity21 when the plans fell through			1
' what was meant to be a happy occasion , planning the best day of our lives has turned into the worst , ' @entity38 said			0
ruined plans : the couple would have been married on 27 october in the @entity13 ' the fact that this has gone on since we booked the wedding in january has left me stressed , fighting depression and has affected my work as i need time off			1
' we managed to receive all of the money that we paid for the holiday back but it does not compensate for the fact that @entity8 and i were supposed to be married at the end of october and now we are not			1
' we had bought the rings , the suits , a bridesmaid dress and paid for decorations , it is such a huge shame			0
i went through hell and the amount of time we spent in the travel agents was a joke			0
' it 's safe to say that we will not be using @entity21 again			0
' a spokesperson for @entity21 said , ' @entity21 would like to apologise to ms @entity7 with regards to the service she received when recently making her wedding arrangements with us			2
@entity21 has apologised for the disappointment that they faced , saying ' it is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are sorry that we fell short of ms @entity7 's expectations ' ' it is never our intention to disappoint our customers , and we are sorry that we fell short of ms @entity7 ’s expectations in this instance			1
due to an operational change at the original hotel , @entity21 were no longer in a position to be able to offer ms @entity7 her first choice of venue			2
@entity21 sought to make alternative arrangements for the @entity152 party			0
however , none of the proposed venues were either available during the selected dates of travel or deemed by the customers to be suitable for their wedding requirements , despite these being of the same , like - for - like level as ms @entity7 ’s original choice of hotel			2
@entity21 can confirm that ms @entity7 has cancelled her booking with us , and we have fully reimbursed her the deposit paid			2
' we understand that ms @entity7 and her fiancée are now no longer seeking to marry abroad and are in the process of making arrangements for a @entity168 wedding			2
' we will be providing the couple with a gesture of goodwill by way of apology , and we would like to wish ms @entity7 and her future husband the very best in their married life together			1
