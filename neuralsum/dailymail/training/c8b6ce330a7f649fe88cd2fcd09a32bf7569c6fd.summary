by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 08:04 est , 18 june 2012 inappropriate : @entity1 , 33 , made the comment when her colleague asked why she had not been invited to her hen party a ' racist ' nurse who imitated @entity6 in front of a colleague has been found guilty of misconduct			1
@entity1 , 33 , told colleague @entity10 she was not invited to her hen party in @entity11 ' coz you is black ' in front of other employees at @entity15			1
the comment , which ms @entity1 said was ' banter ' left ms @entity10 feeling ' disgusted ' and ' quite upset ' and was judged by a member of a misconduct panel as being racist			1
the @entity20 accepted @entity21 , a junior sister at the time , had been imitating the comic character and intended the remark as banter			1
but panel chairman @entity25 insisted its content was racist , whether it was said in jest or not , adding the behaviour ' clearly ' amounted to misconduct			2
he continued : ' for a junior sister to direct a racist joke at a staff nurse in a hospital ward is so clearly misconduct that the contrary can not be argued			2
' it 's vital to proclaim to members of the profession and public at large that this type of behaviour is never to be condoned			0
' the hearing was told the conversation took place in front of other employees and near a patient on ward 10 of @entity15			0
@entity21 later approached her colleague to say she had only been ' having a laugh ' by alluding to @entity6 's catch phrase : ' is it coz i is black ? ' panel chairman mr @entity25 said there was concern at @entity21 's ' limited ' insight into her actions and had decided , as a result , that her fitness to practise was impaired			0
comedy act : @entity65 's @entity6 character used ' is it coz i 'm black ' as one of his many catchphrases asked by @entity71 , for the @entity20 , whether @entity21 had replicated his accent or body language , ms @entity10 replied : ' no , not at all			1
she said ' it 's because you are black			0
' ms @entity10 continued : ' i felt quite distressed to be honest			1
i was quite upset about it			2
' it was a joke about my colour			2
something i did not ask for and something i did not find funny			0
' i thought it was a racist joke			2
words said as humour to one person is not humour to someone else			0
' but @entity86 , defending , insisted @entity21 - who apologised that night - had used @entity6 's exact words and added actions to stress her point			0
he said ms @entity10 laughed along with the others at first , before abruptly changing her mind			1
mr @entity86 also suggested to ms @entity10 - who said she had used a ' jokey ' tone when asking why she had not been invited to the hen do - she should have expected a ' humorous ' reply			1
the panel accepted @entity21 's account as it was consistent with the recollections of the other colleagues present			0
@entity21 admitted making an ' inappropriate ' remark to ms @entity10 on or around august 12 , 2007 , but denied being racist			1
she was also accused of asking a @entity103 colleague @entity102 whether she wore a headscarf because her hair was greasy on a night - out in july 2007			0
@entity21 accepted making an ' inappropriate ' comment , but denied being racist and using those exact words			0
colleagues : ms @entity1 and ms @entity10 had been working together at @entity15 when the ' offensive ' comment was made the panel agreed the comment was not racist , but ' disparaging to religion ' and therefore amounted to misconduct as well			1
a third allegation , that @entity21 asked staff nurse @entity115 at some point in 2006 when @entity117 was going to end because she was ' suffering ' , was found not proved			0
the hearing will continue at a later date , where ms @entity1 will find out what sanction she faces for the misconduct charge .			2

@entity10 felt ' disgusted ' and ' quite upset ' at ' joke '
@entity1 , 33 , said remark was intended as ' banter '
