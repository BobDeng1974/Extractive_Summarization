@entity0 should not go to the @entity1 with @entity2 this summer , instead saving himself for @entity4 's first team , according to @entity5			1
@entity0 won his first senior caps for @entity2 last week , but is still eligible for @entity8 's @entity7			1
but @entity5 believes he has proven himself capable of making the step up , and should be kept fresh for the full @entity10 in 2016			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring his first @entity2 goal , just moments after coming off the bench @entity0 showed against @entity13 that he can cope with playing against some of the world 's best defenders @entity0 is ready to be a permanent member of the full squad , rather than the under - 21s , says @entity5 ' @entity0 does n’t need to go back to playing under - 21 football , ' said @entity5 in @entity21			1
' he proved that the other night against a defence which included two players from @entity13 ’s best team , @entity24 - he did n’t look bad , did he ? ' ' playing under - 21 football this summer wo n’t help him			2
it will just tire him out			0
' the former @entity28 and @entity29 boss claimed that the @entity7 have done their job if they produce a player ready for the first team , and neither @entity0 , nor the other eligible players , should be bounced between the two squads			2
' i do n’t think the under - 21s is there to win tournaments - although it ’s nice if you do , and you do n’t want to encourage someone that losing is good			0
' but it is more important you look at the individual , and if @entity4 thinks @entity0 is going to be part of his squad for @entity47 , then that is what they should be gearing towards			0
' @entity0 is elligible to play for the @entity7 at this summer 's tournament , but @entity5 says he should n't go @entity51 will be hopeful that their star striker does n't tire himself out playing for both @entity2 teams			1

@entity0 won his first two @entity2 caps last week
the @entity51 striker has scored eight times in 10 under - 21 games
but @entity61 believes he has moved on now , and should not *return*
