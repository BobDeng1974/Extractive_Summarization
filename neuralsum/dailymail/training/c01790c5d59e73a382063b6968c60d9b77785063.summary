risk : the @entity11 research shows that one in 65 babies delivered in @entity15 hospitals during the week suffer some form of harm			1
but at weekends , the ratio rises to one in 60 complications include brain damage , spinal injury , broken bones and scarring to the head and face			1
these happen when doctors and midwives fail to act quickly enough , either during labour difficulties or during an intervention such as a caesarean section			0

staffing : separate figures from the @entity61 published in september found that a third of maternity units have no consultants at the weekends @entity66 , of the group @entity67 , said : ‘ babies are n’t just born mondays to fridays			1
‘ it is very frightening that babies may be suffering complications that will be with them for the rest of their lives just because the right person was n’t around at the weekend			2
‘ it ’s extraordinary that doctors ’ schedules allow them to only work monday to friday when babies are born and people become ill round the clock on all days of the week			2
’ the report warned most maternity units are left solely in the hands of ‘ doctors in training ’ – junior medics – at weekends with a consultant available on the phone			0

i find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services is spent on clinical negligence cover			0
’ the audit office said a lack of consultant cover was not the sole reason for the greater risk at weekends because fewer midwives and other specialists work these hours			2
it also found that babies born in hospitals in @entity15 are far more likely to die than elsewhere in the @entity126 and @entity127			1
the mortality rate is 7.5 per 1,000 births in @entity15 compared with 6.9 in @entity130 , 6.6 in @entity131 , 6.4 in @entity132 and 5.5 in @entity133			0
