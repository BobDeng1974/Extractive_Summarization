a new material based on the skin of cuttlefish that makes objects and clothing invisible under infrared light could revolutionise modern warfare			1
scientists have developed a transparent adhesive tape that can change how it reflects infrared light simply by stretching the material			1
when the cuttlefish - inspired tape is activated , it makes objects match the appearance of their surroundings - at least when viewed through infrared or thermal cameras			1
cuttlefish have shape - shifting molecules in their skin that enables them to blend into their background the tape , which is totally clear under visible light , could be used to create new types of camouflage clothing for soldiers to help them hide from weapons that use infrared imaging sights			1
we have all thought about how wonderful it would be to throw on a cloak that can hide us from the intrusive eyes of others			0
ever since professor @entity36 , a physicist at @entity37 and his colleagues first outlined their theory in 2006 that it may be possible to hide objects using metamaterials , there has been a flurry of research in the area			0
researchers in the @entity47 were able to cloak a three dimensional object for the first time from microwaves in 2012			0
however the object remained visible to the human eye			0
others have managed to create similar cloaks that scatter radio waves and also from sound waves			0
however , so far the only way it has been possible to hide an object from the human eye has been to use lenses that bend the light around it			1
professor @entity36 has also used calcite crystals to send polarised light in different direction , directing it around small objects like paperclips			0
it could render many of the thermal sights and infrared imaging equipment used by modern military weapons ineffective			1
researchers say the technology could also be used to produce clothing and coats that can keep people cool on warm days while retaining heat when the weather is cold			1
the technology is based upon a protein found in the skin of cephalopods like cuttlefish , octopus and squid			0
these sea creatures can change the way their skin reflects light by altering the pigment it contains , allowing them to blend in with their background			1
dr @entity95 , a materials chemist at the @entity97 , and his colleagues say their the material they have produced is transparent and so can be used with traditional military camouflage			1
it would mean that soldiers would be able to slip past surveillance using thermal technology without being seen			2
speaking to @entity107 , dr @entity95 said : ' camouflage is the target application for the stickers			0
' to change the infrared reflectance of our materials , we take sticky adhesive tape coated with the protein and stretch it			1
' this causes the reflectance of the coated to tape to shift from the infrared to the visible			2
the application of gentle heating can reverse the effect			0
' ' we are working on making analogous stickers with reflectance that could be tuned in the thermal infrared			2
' if we achieve this , you could integrate the analogous stickers into clothing for electively trapping or releasing body heat			2
' while the new material might not yet allow people to enjoy invisibilty like @entity134 ( above ) in visible light , it could help soldiers hide from infrared and thermal cameras by allowing them to blend into the background cuttlefish and other cephalopods are well known for their ability to blend into their surroundings by changing colour and shape			1
they can mimic everything from seaweed , rocks to other sea creatures animals			0
their skin contains cells known as iridophores that reflect and refract light as it hits them			2
the membranes of these cells incorporate plate - like structures that contain the protein reflectin			0
when this protein is altered in a process called phosphorylation , it changes the size and structure of these tiny plates and in turn changes how the cells reflect light			2
dr @entity95 and his team were able to replicate this by placing a thin layer of graphine oxide on top of a clear sticky tape			2
the new coating can be placed on tape to give it the same reflectivity as background vegetation , as shown in the images above			0
image a shows untreated and treated tape under normal lighting conditions while image b shows how they appear under infrared light			1
the treated tape looks the same as the plant leaf on the right the reflectivity can be changed by stretching or heating the material and can then return to its normal state afterwards			2
writing in the @entity193 , dr @entity95 said : ' we draw inspiration from the structures and proteins found in cephalopod skin to fabricate biomimetic camouflage coatings on transparent and flexible adhesive substrates			1
' the substrates can be deployed on arbitrary surfaces , and we can reversibly modulate their reflectance from the visible to the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with a mechanical stimulus			0
' these stickers make it possible to disguise common objects with varied roughnesses and geometries from infrared visualization			0
' our findings represent a key step towards the development of wearable biomimetic color - and shape - shifting technologies for stealth applications			0
' the way the new material reflects infrared light can be changed by stretching , as shown in the graphic above many pieces of advanced weaponry now use thermal sights to detect and designate targets - including the @entity228 helicopter and modern tanks			1
civilian clothing featuring such technology , however , could make it harder for police helicopters , which also use thermal imaging , to track suspects			1
but dr @entity95 said that similar technology could also be used to produce new types of clothing that can keep the wearer warm and cold as needed			1
speaking to @entity240 , dr @entity95 said : ‘ we hope to eventually develop autonomous clothing - integrated devices that will regulate how a person radiatively exchanges heat with their environment			0
‘ would n’t it be neat if you had a jacket which could adapt to keep you cool on warm days and warm on cold days ? ’			0

scientists at the @entity97 mimicked cuttlefish camouflage
they have created an adhesive tape that can blend into its surroundings
the transparent tape can be stuck on top of existing coloured camouflage
when stretched or heated the material changes how it reflects infrared light
this allows it to reflect infrared light in a similar way to its surroundings
the material could be used to hide soldiers from thermal imaging sights
researchers say it could also lead to new types of *outdoor* jackets that keep the wearer cool in *hot* weather while trapping heat in cold conditions
