' uh - uh ! stop ! stop ! no ! because there 's no comparison			0

' ' no comparison ' : when the student asked why it was ok to discuss @entity13 , the teacher said he should be treated differently as a candidate then he tries to reason with the teacher that plenty of people have talked badly about president @entity100			1
the teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current president because ' people were arrested for saying rather poor things about @entity100			1
