by @entity0 for @entity1 sex scandal : @entity3 already faces a group legal action by 15 abuse victims from the town but the firm representing them the victims of the @entity14 sex abuse scandal could be paid up to £ 140million in compensation , the solicitor representing them revealed today			1
@entity17 law firm @entity16 is working on behalf of 15 women who were raped and sexually exploited over a 16 year period and are seeking at least £ 100,000 from the council for each victim			1
as children they were among 1,400 victims habitually abused by men in the town – almost all of them of @entity27 origin - because the council and police turned a blind eye to their plight			1
@entity16 ' head of child abuse , @entity32 , told @entity1 today that after yesterday 's damning report the authorities have a ' duty ' to offer compensation to each of the 1,400 victims identified			1
the council and police have admitted ' systemic failures ' allowed predators to abuse on an ' industrial ' scale and are certain to face a bill for millions of pounds in compensation			2
the cash could come from the local authority 's reserves , from borrowing or the sale of assets			0
this would leave @entity3 with a potential bill of approaching £ 140million , which would be paid out because many victims have been unable to work because of their ordeal			1
mr @entity32 said that recently @entity57 , another local authority who failed to cope with paedophile rings in their area , recently paid out £ 115,000 to a victim			2
' we represent 15 women who suffered abuse in @entity14 and two more have contacted us in the 24 hours since the report was released			2
' it is important to remember that at the time of the abuse they were children under the age of 16 and could not legally consent			0
' the council are aware of them and we are at the stage where we would like to agree compensation settlements with them			2
if this fails then we will go to court			0
' @entity3 and @entity75 missed clear opportunities to prevent the sexual exploitation of dozens of girls in @entity14			0
' this is an extraordinary case but @entity57 recently settled for £ 115,000 with one victim , i would say on average we would be looking for £ 100,000 each			1
' if it is found that in other cases the council held information that could have prevented abuse they would also be liable '			2
legal battle : should @entity3 settle with victims it could be faced with a bill of up to £ 140million ' they have suffered horrific abuse but they are part of a wider group			1
the council has a duty to use the information now in its hands to find them and agree settlements '			1
if the council agreed to pay compensation to every victim it would be left with a huge bill			0
@entity106 admitted in 2012 it may have to sell landmarks like the @entity109 centre to cover up to £ 1billion in legal claims over equal pay			0
thousands of women were found to be paid less than others , mainly men , who did the same or equivalent jobs , and won their case in court as part of a huge group action			0
if @entity3 faced similar problems they may be forced to sell buildings and land			0
@entity1 has approached them for a comment .			0
