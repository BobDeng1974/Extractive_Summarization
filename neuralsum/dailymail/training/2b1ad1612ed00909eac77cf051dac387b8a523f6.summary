boys roll in mud and climb trees , while girls prefer sitting quietly and playing with dolls			1
or at least that ’s what adverts for @entity8 shoes would have you believe – triggering an online backlash from parents who complain the firm is being ‘ sexist and offensive ’			1
the shoe shop has been accused of gender stereotyping on its posters which suggest boys need hard - wearing shoes for running around , while girls are more concerned with looking pretty			1
gender stereotyping : this slogan for @entity8 shoes in @entity21 , @entity22 , prompted 3,000 complaints online one of the adverts , which are displayed in store , proclaims in blue : ‘ because boys test their shoes to destruction , so do we			1
’ another poster , in pink , says : ‘ because girls love comfort and style , we design both into our shoes			1
’ last night the firm said it was ‘ never our intention to cause offence ’ as it faced a barrage of complaints on @entity42			1
@entity43 , a lawyer from @entity44 , north @entity22 , and mother of two boys and a girl , launched an online petition calling for the removal of the adverts , which last night had been signed by more than 3,000 people			1
she said : ‘ i was horrified to find gender stereotyped notices above the boys ’ and girls ’ shoes			2
‘ these offensive posters suggest boys are active while girls are passively pretty			2
pretty in pink : a @entity8 spokesman insisted the font colour was not intended to cause any offence ‘ gender stereotyping has an important effect on children ’s development			2
to suggest that boys engage in active outdoor play of the type that destroys shoes , while girls are interested in fashion and looking pretty , is to reinforce damaging social stereotypes			2
‘ i grew up in the carefree 1970s when kids were kids and my brother and i wore matching outfits on a regular basis			0
