by @entity0 while @entity2 was steadily compiling his first test hundred for @entity4 , his captain @entity1 was sat in the changing room pondering where his own next three - figure score will come from			1
@entity4 ’s skipper is in a rut			2
he has not scored a century for @entity4 since july last year and his last 23 innings have yielded just 585 runs at an average of 25			1
after a remarkable start to his reign — which saw him score five hundreds in his first nine tests in charge — it is hard to escape the conclusion that the burden of captaincy is beginning to affect his batting as it ’s affected so many @entity4 captains in the past			1
out of sorts : @entity1 has not scored a hundred for @entity4 since july last year and his last 23 innings have yielded just 585 runs at an average of 25 @entity1 spoke ahead of this second @entity28 of his desire to silence the constant sniping from the likes of @entity33 cheerleader @entity32 by recording what would be his 26th test hundred			1
he had the perfect stage against a limited @entity38 attack on a @entity40 pitch with few of the demons the visitors perceived on day one			0
but he added just three runs to his overnight score of 14 before prodding with hard hands at an apparently innocuous delivery from medium pacer @entity47 , edging a regulation catch to first slip			2
‘ it ’s where he gets out every time , ’ said one @entity4 fan			2
he was not far wrong			0
the big concern for the left - handed opener is that opposition bowlers have , after 104 tests and 25 hundreds , worked out a method that consistently troubles him			0
by bowling a full length on or around off - stump and refusing to bowl anything short or on his hips , @entity1 is being strangled outside off - stump far too often for comfort			0
he is made of stern stuff , no doubt			0
and with 8,109 test runs at 46.07 he has proved himself to be a world - class performer at the top of @entity4 ’s order			1
eyes on the ball : @entity1 's immediate future is not in doubt , but he needs a big score soon but being captain is a solitary place when you are not scoring runs and , as well as dealing with the media , tactical and management elements of the job , the 29 - year - old must ensure he focuses enough time on his own game to put right his technical wrongs			1
the last time @entity1 went through a trough like this was in 2010 against @entity86 when he went on to play a career - defining innings of 110 at the @entity88 which saved his international career			1
his immediate future is not in doubt — despite the horror of last winter where he was powerless to stop @entity93 crushing his side — but he needs a big score soon , if only for his own peace of mind and to enable him to concentrate on the @entity4 captaincy , a difficult enough job by itself			2
he will gain a measure of peace a few days after this test when he visits his wife @entity104 ’s parents farm in @entity105 — where he goes to find mental solace away from the strains of international cricket — and he will no doubt also consult his old friend and mentor @entity110			0
but while leadership is a lonely place , so is batting			0
and @entity1 knows the only person who can solve his woes at the crease is staring back at him in the mirror .			0
