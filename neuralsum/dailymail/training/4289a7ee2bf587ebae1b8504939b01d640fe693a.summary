by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 8 april 2013 from cleaning up banana smeared floors to non-stop running around , bringing up a young family can feel like an endurance test at times			0
and although this musical offering from @entity8 father of three @entity9 wo n't make chores and stress go away , it might just put a smile on your face			1
set to @entity16 's famous @entity15 , the @entity17 to sleep deprived parents and @entity19 , includes such lyrics as : ' put my phone down / where are your pants ? ' , ' why wo n't you sleep ? / is it your teeth ? ' - all of which will be instantly recognisable to the harassed parents of those entering the terrible twos			1
harmonious : @entity31 's @entity30 sings @entity33 's revamped version of the @entity15 familiar ? @entity9 's lyrics will strike a chord with anyone who has or has had a toddler in their life o ' you terror ! get down from there ! mummy 's getting cranky ... put my phone @entity44 are your pants ? what have you done with my purse ? do n't throw those @entity50 is that smell ? why do you look so happy ? what 's in your mouth ? who ripped that book ? why wo n't you just stop moving ? he 's on the chair ! just standing there ! wobbling like a drunk @entity58 is my mug ? what was that crash ? who let you in the kitchen ? you 've got a knife ! put it down now ! do n't wave it near your sister ! put my phone @entity44 are my apps ? who dialled triple zero ? why wo n't you sleep ? is it your teeth ? i need another coffee ! my head 's so sore ! look at the floor ! cleaning will take forever			1
what 's wrong with you ? what did i do ? why do you do this to me ? i hope when you ... have some kids too ... they drive you crazy ! the new version of @entity15 , which has been used on scores of film soundtracks including @entity88 , is the result of the @entity90 's ' say it with @entity93 ' contest , which invited members of the @entity8 public to come up with new lyrics			2
despite competition that included odes to the @entity100 and one entrant 's new pet cat , @entity9 ’s libretto received the most votes			2
according to @entity9 , who lives in @entity31 , the ditty was inspired by his youngest son , who at just a year old , has started walking , climbing and generally causing mayhem in the @entity9 household			1
when he penned the winning lyrics , @entity9 ’s wife @entity108 had just endured a ' night of limited sleep and a day of rampant destruction ' with the toddler			2
' ( @entity114 ) recognised many of the phrases instantly and given that our son threw her phone into the toilet two days later , they seemed very appropriate , ' @entity9 told @entity121 - a parenting blog linked to @entity124 's today show			1
' i put the lyrics together one lunchtime when i heard about the contest			0
the original lyrics refer to a relentless wheel of fate crushing the poet , and @entity16 's music reflects that , with its short , sharp phrases and its repeating melodies			0
' somehow , the idea popped into my head that we speak to our children in ‘ short , sharp phrases ’ as well when we 're telling them off			0
' the winning entry was sung by the 200 members of the @entity142 and the resulting video posted on @entity144 , where since last month , it has received more than 150,000 views			0
' parenting , while it 's highly rewarding , is also a job that involves many frustrations and we constantly find ourselves barking orders to these little people that just wo n't listen , ' added @entity9 , who also revealed that he hopes to show the video to his son when he 's older - ideally on his 21st birthday			1
' so i think many parents have found themselves saying very similar things to their children			0

the @entity17 to sleep deprived parents was written by @entity9
the @entity8 father of three was inspired by his one - year - old son
he hopes to eventually show him the video , ideally on his 21st birthday
