by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 06:51 est , 17 may 2012 three astronauts have arrived on the @entity2 after successfully hitching a lift on a @entity5 - built shuttle			1
@entity7 astronaut @entity6 and @entity5 cosmonauts @entity8 and @entity10 are set for a four - and - half - month stay in space , after docking with the @entity2 in the early hours of this morning			1
the astronauts were aboard the @entity15 craft for two days , as they made their 240 - mile vertical trip			1
it is a busy week in space - in two days there is a planned launch of the privately owned @entity22 's @entity21 from @entity23			2
see video of the docking here : docked ! the @entity15 makes contact wit the @entity2 , as it hangs suspended above @entity27 the view from the balcony of the @entity30 this morning , following the successful delivery of the astronauts to the @entity2 3 , 2 , 1 : the @entity34 spacecraft carrying the @entity2 blasted off from its launch pad at @entity36 blast off : @entity8 , center , @entity10 , right , and @entity6 , left , launched in the @entity34 rocket at the @entity5 @entity36 , @entity39 on tuesday @entity40 : three minutes into the flight , the crew members gave a thumbs - up signal to a camera on board the capsule after safely docking on the @entity2 , the three astronauts had to wait for about three hours as leak and pressure checks were carried out , before they were finally welcomed by their new crew mates			1
the $ 100billion space station is currently occupied by @entity5 cosmonaut @entity52 , @entity7 astronaut @entity53 and @entity55 's @entity54			2
before they left , soyuz commander @entity8 , flight engineer @entity10 of @entity5 , and @entity57 prime @entity7 flight engineer @entity6 were blessed by priests and wished well from dozens of onlookers that saw their spacecraft leave the @entity36 in @entity39			2
three minutes into the flight , the crew members gave a thumbs - up signal to a camera on board the capsule			0
an anchor inside @entity70 outside @entity71 told assembled scientists and students that the three astronauts were feeling well			2
@entity7 , which officially retired its shuttle fleet last year , has relied exclusively on @entity5 @entity15 craft for space station crew transport since late 2009			0
according to the organisation more than 1,500 launches have been made with the craft to orbit satellites for telecommunications , @entity27 observation , weather and scientific missions , as well as for human flights			0
space case : the astronauts waved farewell to the dozens of people that came to watch them launch good spirits : before the launch , @entity6 posed for photographers a @entity15 space capsule took the first crew to the @entity2 in november 2000 and since that time , at least one @entity15 has always been at the @entity2 , generally to serve as a lifeboat should the crew have to return to @entity27 unexpectedly			1
after the @entity99 accident in february 2003 , the @entity34 became the means of transportation for crewmembers going to or returning from the orbiting laboratory			0
however , tuesday 's flight was delayed from march 30 to allow @entity5 's partly state - owned space contractor , @entity106 , to prepare a new capsule for launch after an accident during pressure tests damaged the @entity15 crew capsule			0
orbit : @entity6 autographs the door of his room before leaving the hotel for a final pre-launch preparation close watch : this photograph provided by @entity7 shows how closely the launch was monitored @entity71 hopes a smooth mission will begin to restore confidence in its once - pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year , including the failure of a mission touted as post-soviet @entity5 's interplanetary debut			0
the @entity15 spacecraft is always launched to the @entity129 from the @entity36 in @entity39 aboard a @entity15 rocket			0
@entity15 reaches orbit , it spends two days chasing the @entity2			1
the crew performs systems checks and keeps in touch with controllers at the @entity30 during that time			0
the @entity136 : a @entity138 priest blesses the @entity34 spacecraft at the launch pad of the @entity5 - leased @entity36 on @entity141 , 2012 joining forces : @entity8 , left , and the rest of the crew joined @entity5 cosmonaut @entity52 , @entity7 's @entity53 and @entity145 astronaut @entity54 aboard the @entity2 a @entity15 trip to the station takes two days from launch to docking , but the return to @entity27 takes less than 3.5 hours			1
the previous crew of three at the @entity2 returned from the station in late april , following a delay due to safety fears after an unmanned @entity5 progress craft taking supplies to the station broke up in the atmosphere in august .			1

astronauts will remain on @entity2 for the next four months
team of three arrived at *4.36am* *gmt* this morning
