but if you love it , this new tool could herald the beginning of a new chapter in your breakfast life			2
@entity3 have invented a special knife enabling you to scrape every last morsel of the gooey black stuff from the bottom of its awkwardly shaped jar			1
the @entity20 ( see what they did there ? ) has been specifically designed for use on those hard - to - reach round nooks and troublesome crannies during a @entity24 - typically defined as the moment when the pot has virtually run dry and the shops are closed			1
this special tool - the result of an intense 18 month development process - was created due to overwhelming demand from disgruntled fans unable to relish every last savoury smidgen of @entity3 from its pot. it 's a @entity24 ! the @entity20 kit includes a @entity39 , @entity40 , and a pot of @entity3 to get you started @entity3 spokesperson , @entity43 , said : ' we 've had comments from our @entity47 community about the difficulty people have in getting all their @entity3 out of the jar			1
' now , finally , we have a solution that reaches the spots other utensils just ca n't get to			2
' the silicone spatula is shaped around a steel core to give it the balance and weight required to get into the hard - to - reach corners of a 125g and 250g jar			1
@entity61 from the design team @entity62 & @entity63 said : ' we 've spent ages staring at the bottom of the jar to work out the best solution and i 've got to say , its been a real labour of love			2
after 15 re-designs to get the @entity20 just right , i think we 've finally done it			1
' the perfect gift : the @entity20 pack , left , comes with a @entity39 , a pot of @entity3 and a tip book , while the @entity80 edition , right , is flecked with edible pieces of gold alongside the launch of their @entity39 , @entity3 are also releasing their limited edition @entity80			1
the sparkly spread boasts the same unique ' love it or hate it ' taste , but packaged in a gold jar and with the addition of real edible gold flecks			2
to celebrate the precious pot , the brand is also sponsoring @entity98 's 2012 @entity97 christmas lights - and for the first time ever people will have the chance to appear within the mile long display along the world 's favourite high street			1
power tool : the @entity20 , which plans to bring an end everyone 's end - of - the - jar woes christmas time : the @entity97 lights will be sponsored by @entity3 this year miss @entity43 said : ' 2012 has certainly been a great year for @entity110 – from the @entity111 to unprecedented sporting achievements – so what better way to top it all off than giving everyone the chance to shine in this years @entity119 lights			1
the display , which features classic animated @entity122 characters with a love / hate twist , will run from @entity124 to @entity125 for a six week period			0
people will also be given the chance to tell the world what they think of @entity3 , on a specially designed banner overlooking @entity131			0
people can get their moment of fame by uploading a photo on @entity3 's @entity47 page , after which they will be sent an email with the designated time frame for when their image will appear			0
those who ca n't make it down to the capital need n’t worry about missing out as they will still be able to see their ' face in lights ' via a live webcam and an online gallery			1
shoppers on @entity97 will also be able to get involved through an interactive bus shelter located near @entity152 tube station			0

the sticky black spread was made using the concentrated cells of brewer 's yeast , and little has changed in the production method since then			0
what 's in a name : @entity3 originally came in a small earthenware pot , similar to the kind of @entity231 casserole dish called a ' marmite ' the yeast is broken down to release soluble amino acids and proteins			0
this soluble material is then concentrated and filtered a few times before going through a unique process for flavour development			2
a blend of vitamins - as well as vegetable and spice extracts - is then added to create @entity3 's unique taste			2

@entity3 originally came in a small earthenware pot , similar to the kind of @entity231 casserole dish called a ' @entity3 '			0

you can still see the original ' @entity3 ' dish pictured on the front of the pot , but the firm began using glass jars in the 1920s			0
