by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 1 december 2012 standing in the midst of a group of reporters with his back against a wall at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 suddenly seems struck by his longevity as a footballer			2
‘ it ’s amazing is n’t it ? ’ he laughed			1
‘ twenty years we ’ve all been doing this			2
but i ’m just thankful i ’m still playing			2
‘ you guys are the same			2
you ’re still reporting on games			2
you are probably thinking : “ oh sh * t , not again ”			2
but this game never gets old for me			2
i never get tired of it			2
’ still going strong : @entity9 has made it clear that he wants to play on at 37 , @entity9 still has n’t changed much			1
from @entity26 to @entity27 to @entity8 ( with a pit stop in @entity29 ) , @entity9 ’s career has been more eclectic than anybody would have imagined , but it ’s clear the fire has not yet gone out			2
he will play in the @entity33 for @entity34 against @entity35 at lunchtime local time today - his final game for the club - and then quickly turn his head to stare down the next challenge			2
despite the aches and pains of an ageing athlete , retirement is n’t an option			1
events across the pond at @entity48 in the first month of this year convinced him of that			2
‘ i saw what happened with @entity52 , ’ he said , referring to @entity52 ’s decision to reverse his retirement			1
‘ i plan to keep playing as long as i can because i know when @entity52 stepped away he came back and regretted stopping			1
old friends : @entity9 in his @entity56 days with @entity52 ( centre ) and @entity58 ( left ) ‘ you know when it ’s time and obviously @entity52 realised it was n’t his time at that moment and i ’m the same			1
it ’s not my time			0
it ’s nice to see him and @entity58 still playing at @entity56 they ’ve had successful careers there and to see them playing like they do now is great			1
we grew up together and , like them , i want to play as long as my legs will take me			0
’ thursday was pretty much ‘ @entity9 day ’ at @entity34 training			0
a conditioning session in the @entity78 drizzle at 10am and then media commitments ahead of his final game after six seasons in the @entity83			0
after all this time , he remains the @entity33 ’s biggest media draw			0
@entity9 was n’t due to speak to @entity87 journalists but , as usual , he found the extra time			1
although his plans were off limits , he did admit that he harbours ambitions to play in the @entity92 again			0
‘ i think that because i always loved it , ’ he said			0
‘ i still miss playing in it ; they are the games you love playing in			0
centre of attention : @entity9 took the time out to speak to @entity87 journalists ‘ we ’ll see where i go next			0
if it ’s a team that ’s in the @entity92 then it will be nice to be back			1
wherever i ’ve gone it ’s been a big deal throughout my career			0
whether it ’s been going on loan to @entity29 or leaving @entity56 for @entity27 or @entity27 to here , it ’s always been big news			1
this next move will be a move that is about the football			0
that has never been any different for me			0
‘ people say some of the moves have been about money but my answer is always the same , that my career has never been about money			0
i ’m not money motivated , i just want to play for the best team and with the best players			1
’ it is remarkable to think it is almost a decade since @entity9 left @entity56			1
‘ i could n’t have stayed , it was n’t an option obviously , ’ he said with a smile			1
since that time , little has changed in @entity87			0
@entity56 were top of the @entity127 when he left and are top again ahead of this weekend ’s games			1
‘ i ’m not surprised by that , i do n’t know why anybody is surprised by that , ’ he said			1
up for the cup : @entity9 will line up alongside @entity133 ( right ) for @entity34 for the last time ‘ i ’ve always said that money at football clubs is ok sometimes , but it does n’t last forever			1
i think @entity56 are a club about history			1
other clubs might have the money and might be able to pay players more but when @entity56 come calling it ’s impossible to turn them down			1
‘ you see a player like @entity144 has spent the years he has at @entity145 but when @entity56 come knocking it ’s impossible to say no. it does n’t matter what other clubs are interested and what money is being thrown around			1
’ @entity9 will one day take up an ambassadorial role at @entity48			0
‘ i ’m sure that will happen in some way , ’ he confirmed			0
for now , though , he is looking forward to owning one of the @entity33 ‘ development franchises ’ ( essentially one of the smaller , newer clubs ) in the near future and keeping retirement at bay that little bit longer			1
mum 's the word : @entity9 did not discuss his future ‘ i would n’t say i ’m scared of retiring , ’ he said			1
‘ but i know i will miss it when i finish playing , of course			0
every player and every professional person who walks away from a job misses it			0
‘ i ’d like to be an owner because i do n’t want to be a manager			1
management has never interested me			0
i love playing and coaching but i would rather be an owner			0
’ @entity9 is expected to spend @entity172 in @entity87			0
indeed his wife @entity173 and their four children have already left @entity176 for the @entity177			0
it wo n’t be long before his next move becomes clear			1
meanwhile he will have time to watch his best friend @entity181 ’s tv career blossoming			0
‘ he ’s always loved to talk so it does n’t surprise me , ’ he laughed			2
‘ sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just have to ignore him			0

@entity52 retired too early , i wo n’t do that
clubs *flash* cash but @entity56 have history
i want to own a team not manage one *...*
