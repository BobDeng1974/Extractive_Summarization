by @entity0 published : 00:19 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 00:19 est , 9 november 2012 the middle - classes have seen the sharpest increase in numbers of children with nut allergies parents who keep their homes obsessively clean could be causing their children to develop life - threatening nut allergies , researchers claim			1
in the past 20 years the number of @entity13 children with the condition has doubled – with the sharpest increase among the middle classes			1
scientists say their findings support the theory that youngsters from wealthier families have a weakened immune system because they live in cleaner homes			1
their study examined 8,306 patients , 776 of which had some form of reaction to peanuts , and the findings were presented at the annual meeting of the @entity31			0
lead study author , allergist dr @entity32 , said : ‘ overall household income is only associated with peanut sensitisation in children aged one to nine years			1
‘ this may indicate that development of peanut sensitisation at a young age is related to affluence , but those developed later in life are not			0
’ researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities			0
‘ while many children can develop a tolerance to food allergens as they age , only 20 per cent will outgrow a peanut allergy , ’ said @entity31 president dr @entity47			1
nut allergies commonly cause breathing problems and occasionally result in death through anaphylactic shock			1
reaction : researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities last year , researchers at @entity62 and @entity63 universities studied records from more than 400 gp practices in @entity66 between 2001 and 2005 to determine the number of patients with an allergy			2
the study showed more than 25,000 people in @entity66 have been diagnosed with a nut allergy at some point in their lives			0
it also found that children from a more affluent background were twice as likely to have a peanut allergy compared to their poorer counterparts			2
one @entity13 child in 50 has a peanut allergy – double the proportion of two decades ago			2
the majority of allergic reactions to nuts are mild , with hives , eczema and vomiting the most common complaints			0
until 2009 , the @entity89 warned women to avoid peanuts in pregnancy and while breastfeeding if there was a family history of allergies			0
the advice was later altered after a major review of scientific evidence showed there is no clear link between eating peanuts at a young age and developing an allergy in later life .			0

in the past 20 years the number of @entity13 children with nut allergies has doubled
the sharpest increase has been among the middle - classes
supports theory that children from affluent families have weaker immune systems as they live in cleaner homes , say scientists
