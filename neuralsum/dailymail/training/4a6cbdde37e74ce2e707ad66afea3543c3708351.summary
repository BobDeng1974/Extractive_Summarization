the giant oarfish , the largest bony fish alive , has finally been caught on camera in its natural environment			1
marine biologists at @entity5 captured the mysterious fish on camera through a partnership with an offshore drilling company in the @entity10			1
the scientists used the company 's remote - operated submersibles and observed the oarfish five times between 2008 and 2011			1
it 's formal scientific title is @entity28 , but the fish is also known as king of the herring , @entity33 oarfish , streamer fish and ribbon - fish			1
and that 's just what the thin fish looks like - a stream of ribbon			2
the oarfish in the video is thought to be around 8 feet long			1
the longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet			2
however , the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds			1
like the equally mysterious giant squid , the oarfish would go on to enchant fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters			0
what a catch ! @entity52 display a 23 - foot giant oarfish found in 1996 on the beach in @entity55 legendary : the oarfish 's massive size spawned many a story from fisherman and sailors the reason the oarfish had n't been caught on camera before is because it lives at extreme ocean depths , between 656 feet ( 0.2 kilometers ) and 3,280 feet ( 1 kilometer ) deep			1
in a partnership called the @entity67 , scientists are able to peer into depths not normally observable by enlisting the help of deep sea oil and gas drillers			1
not much is known about the creature			0
studies had previously only been possible when the rare fish has washed ashore dead or dying			0
though the species has only been sighted in a few places worldwide , it is believed to inhabit deep waters around the globe , save for the polar regions			0
washed up : a giant oarfish that washed ashore on the @entity82 island of @entity83 in february 2002 the fish uses a form of location called amiiform swimming in which its dorsal fin , which runs the length of its sizable body , undulates while the body itself remains straight and motionless			2
last october , an oarfish washed ashore off @entity95			0
it was 15 - feet - long and attracted a crowd of gawkers			2
no one could revive the fish , so it was taken in for scientific study			0
in 2006 , another oarfish in poor condition surfaced in a cove on @entity106 in @entity55			0
@entity107 , a harbormaster , was able to swim with the creature before it died remarking that it 's coloring was ' metallic silver with bright blue - brown spots and splotches , along with its amazing pinkish - red fell length dorsal fin			0
' it also appeared that the fish was blind , which is n't unusual for creatures that live at such deep parts of the ocean where there is little light			1
another spotting of the creature occurred in 1901			0
a 22 - foot oarfish landed on @entity126 , @entity55 , which spurned ' the basis for many sea - serpent stories told by local bay patrons for more than a decade after its discovery , ' according to reporting on @entity132 .			0

@entity134 can grow up to 50 feet long and weigh as much as 600 pounds
@entity5 scientists caught the *elusive* fish on camera in 2011 but only now *published* their findings
oarfish live at extreme ocean depths as much as 3,280 feet below the surface
