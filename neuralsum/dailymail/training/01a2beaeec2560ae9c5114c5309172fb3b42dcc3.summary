by @entity0 published : 13:12 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 7 august 2012 @entity2 banking giant @entity1 is accused of exposing the @entity3 to terrorists and weapon dealers by hiding $ 250 billion worth of transactions with the @entity8 government			1
@entity1 , one of the top five largest banks in the @entity2 by market value , kept around 60,000 transactions secret from @entity3 regulators over nearly 10 years , the @entity9 claimed today			1
the bank , which employs nearly 90,000 people worldwide , has been called to appear before regulators on august 15 to explain the apparent violations and defend its licence to trade on the @entity19			0
its share price fell 18 percent as world markets reacted to the news , wiping £ 6 billion from the bank 's value			1
prices had already dropped six per cent after the accusations were made just before the close of the @entity29 market yesterday			0
the investigation ’s findings come after fellow @entity2 bank @entity32 was accused of allowing drug cartels and rogue states to launder billions of pounds through its @entity3 arm			1
' @entity1 's actions left the @entity3 financial system vulnerable to terrorists , weapons dealers , drug kingpins and corrupt regimes , and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity			2
' in short , @entity1 ( @entity1 ) operated as a rogue institution			1
' the 27 - page report claims the bank was ' apparently aided ' by its consultant @entity59 in concealing the information from regulators , the @entity56 reported			2
the findings include a memo sent in october 2006 from the bank ’s @entity3 chief executive to the group executive director in @entity29 raising concerns about the activities with @entity8			2
he said : ' firstly , we believe ( the @entity8 business ) needs urgent reviewing at the group level to evaluate if its returns and strategic benefits are ... still commensurate with the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group			0
' he added : ' secondly , there is equally importantly potential of risk of subjecting management in @entity3 and @entity29 ( for example you and i ) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and / or serious criminal liability			0
' @entity1 will have to defend its license so it can continue to trade on the @entity19 , pictured			0
to which the group executive director allegedly replied : ' you f * * * * * * @entity3			0
who are you to tell us , the rest of the world , that we ’re not going to deal with @entity8			2
' in another example the report shows one how in 2001 the bank was approached by @entity8 's central bank @entity101 / @entity102 to act as recipient for daily oil sales from the @entity105			1
@entity8 warn the bank that revealing their identities to @entity3 banks would prompt ' unacceptable delays in clearing funds , ' according to the report , the @entity56 said			1
seeking legal advice , @entity1 was told it ' should ascertain that the payments are authorized '			0
but it ignored the warning , instead ' conspired with @entity8 clients to transmit misinformation to the @entity119 branch by removing and otherwise misrepresenting wire transfer data that could identify @entity8 parties , ' the report claims			2
the regulator claims that between january 2001 through to 2010 , @entity1 conspired with @entity8 clients to route payments through @entity119 after first stripping information from wire transfer messages used to identify sanctioned countries			1
the bank moved the transactions through its @entity119 branch on behalf of @entity8 financial institutions that were subject to @entity3 economic sanctions , and then covered up the dealings , the banking regulator claimed			1
the institutions included the @entity135 , as well as @entity136 and @entity137 , both of which are also @entity8 state - owned institutions			0
@entity141 , superintendent of the @entity9 for @entity142 , claimed a @entity1 subsidiary in @entity119 had also tried to do business with @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , the @entity56 reported			1
another dirty revelation : @entity32 's @entity149 , left , and @entity150 , also of @entity32 , faced a @entity3 @entity152 hearing , which ended in mr @entity149 quitting			0
now @entity154 face a hearing to explain their actions financial transactions with @entity8 have been carefully subjected to strict terms since the 1970s			2
restricted , highly scrutinised transactions known as ' u-turns ' were allowed as long as the money ended up in @entity163 banks			0
but the @entity3 treasury revoked u-turn transactions in 2008 because it suspected @entity8 was using its banks to fund its highly controversial nuclear weapons and missile programmes and to channel money to terrorist groups			2
according to @entity141 , @entity1 set up an operation known as ' @entity172 ' aimed at helping @entity8 banks put money through the @entity3 financial system			1
shares in the @entity29 - listed bank immediately plummeted in the last few seconds of trading when the damning report was published just as @entity29 's stock market was closing for the day			0
the attack on @entity1 is a heavy blow to its reputation , which until last night had been regarded as the most solid of any of the @entity29 - listed banks after the 2008 taxpayer bailouts , the more recent libor rigging scandal at @entity183 , and the money laundering offences at @entity32			1
the shocking report follows the scandal of @entity32 , which was discovered through a @entity152 investigation to have allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its @entity3 arm			1
the findings , which accused @entity32 of ignoring warnings and breaching safeguards that should have stopped the laundering of money from @entity201 , @entity8 and @entity202 , led to the resignation of head of compliance @entity149			1
@entity2 's biggest bank allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its branches			1
@entity32 stands accused of fostering such a ‘ polluted ’ culture it became a conduit for criminal enterprises			0
top executive @entity149 , head of @entity32 ’s compliance division , sensationally quit in front of a @entity3 @entity152 hearing that exposed the scale of the scandal			0
he had worked for @entity32 for 20 years			0
@entity32 was warned that the total amount of fines and penalties levelled against it could be ' significantly higher ' than the £ 445million set aside so far			0
