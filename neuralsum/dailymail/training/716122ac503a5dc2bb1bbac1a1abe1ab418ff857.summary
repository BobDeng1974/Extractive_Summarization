by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 14 november 2013 @entity2 : 04:05 est , 15 november 2013 a handyman has been left with a potentially dangerous hole in his head after three operations to repair his skull were cancelled			1
brain tumour patient , @entity9 , 40 , has had to wear a hard hat to protect his brain since part of his skull was removed in january			1
mr @entity9 had surgery to remove a life - threatening growth from his brain in december 2012			1
he then needed a second operation a month later when he contracted an infection			2
@entity9 , 40 , has been left with a hole in his skull for months because the @entity18 has repeatedly cancelled the reconstructive surgery he needs surgeons removed part of his skull to treat the infection - leaving mr @entity9 with an inch - and - a - half long hole in his head			1
a date for the procedure to reconstruct his skull has been set three times in the last two months - only for doctors to cancel every operation at the last minute			2
the father - of - three , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ‘ you prepare yourself , you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it ’s been cancelled			0
‘ i just want to get it over with so i can get on with my life			0
’ mr @entity9 ’s operation was initially scheduled for september 30 at @entity40			1
mr @entity9 had surgery to remove a brain tumour in december 2012 but a month later he developed an infection so had to have part of his skull removed while it was treated			1
@entity40 has apologised for cancelling his reconstructive surgery but he was left devastated after medics sent him a letter informing him it was cancelled just days before he was due to be admitted to the hospital			1
a second date was then set for october 21 , but that was also postponed , the procedure was then due to take place last week but mr @entity9 was told it had to be cancelled again because the hospital had no beds available for him			2
the cancellations mean mr @entity9 has been forced to return to his estate maintenance job without having had the surgery , because his sick pay was about to be cut			2
mr @entity9 said : ' you prepare yourself , you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it 's been cancelled			2
i just want to get it over with so i can get on with my life ' he said : ‘ my doctor told me i should n’t be back at work but how can i afford to be off work ? ’ mr @entity9 says it is dangerous for him to be at work as he is in an environment where he could easily suffer a knock to his head			0
his wife , @entity74 , 48 , a @entity31 city councillor , is blaming the delays on the number of patients the hospital is treating from outside its catchment area			0
she said : ‘ the @entity40 management needs to get its act together , they are letting everyone down			0
‘ @entity84 assured the council it could cope with extra patients and it would n’t affect local people ’s operations			0
so why are so many having theirs cancelled ? ’ mr @entity9 's operation has now been booked in again for november 25 and he is desperately hoping that this time it will go ahead hospital bosses have apologised to mr @entity9 and blamed the third cancellation on an increase in emergency patients			1
@entity96 , chief operating officer at @entity84 , said : ‘ i ’d like to offer our apologies to mr @entity9 for the cancellation of his recent operation			0
‘ this was due to an increase in emergency patients on that day			0
‘ the trust has plans to reduce the impact emergency patients have on scheduled operations			0
‘ however , providing major trauma services is important to ensure specialist services are retained in @entity32 , rather than them having to journey elsewhere			0
’ mr @entity9 ’s operation has now been rescheduled for a fourth time and is due to take place on november 25 .			1
