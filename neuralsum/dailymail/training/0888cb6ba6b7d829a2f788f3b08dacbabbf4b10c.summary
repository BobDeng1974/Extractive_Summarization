by @entity0 scientists have found evidence of 98 deaths and more graves than they previously thought at a @entity7 boys ' reform school , where students were allegedly brutally beaten , raped and murdered			1
researchers from the @entity10 in @entity11 found at least 50 grave shafts at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity7 - 19 more than had been identified by the @entity15 in a 2010 investigation			1
in total , scientists believe a minimum of 96 children - aged from six to 18 - and two adults died between 1911 and the 1973 at the infamous school , with many of the burials going undocumented			1
and there could be even more victims : researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy laws , and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full searches			1
investigators have said they had found at least 50 graves - 19 more than officially reported - on the grounds a report released on monday details the alleged cover - ups by the school , which opened in 1900			1
it was closed in june 2011 by the @entity47 after a years - long controversy over widespread physical and sexual abuse			1
the horrifying findings - and expectations of still more to come - raise troubling questions for the now - shuttered school , its staff and the state			1
previous investigations and lawsuits have been brought by the ' @entity13 ' - so called because much of the abuse took place in an 11 - room building known as the @entity13			1
scene : students called themselves the @entity13 as much of the abuse took place in this building investigation : researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites a group of former students sued the state in 2010 , but their case was dismissed as the statute of limitations had expired			1
other students have written books about their experiences			0
following the claims , researchers at the @entity10 in @entity11 used ground - penetrating radar and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than previously reported			2
the largest gravesite is on the northside of the campus , where @entity90 boys were buried			0
it is at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses , but researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites			1
' we anticipated finding about 25 to 30 grave shafts , ' said @entity98 , an assistant professor of anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site			1
' but in fact we found a minimum of 50			1
' institution : @entity105 was opened as a state reform school in january 1900 for misbehaving boys treatment : the boys were allegedly forced into hard labour , while others were beaten , raped or killed culture : a memorial or burial service around 1950			1
more than 20 students ' burials were undocumented in 2009 , writer @entity117 published the @entity118 detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at @entity13			1
he was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12 , and suffered brutal , bloody beatings in the infamous @entity13 building			1
' little did i know that @entity124 had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole @entity124 , ' he wrote			0
' a devil was hiding behind every tree , every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass			0
' he writes on his website : ' the terrible screams i heard and the brutal beatings i witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever			0
' the beatings i suffered are not my horrors today			0
my horrors are the beatings of crying boys that i had to witness before my own beatings			0
the horror of knowing that i was next			0
' the thick concrete walls and the loud industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they were beaten bloody			0
some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from the buttocks			0
' for almost thirty minutes , at age sixty - two , i stood alone in the exact room where i was almost beaten to death			2
with my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating , i lit a cigarette and i cried without feeling shame			0
' @entity105 's own records show that more than 50 children were buried on the grounds , while more than 30 other bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried			1
but the school failed to record burial locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the site , the @entity165 reported			1
some of the children - and two adults - died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s , while others were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas			1
in january , the researchers will return to the south of the campus , where the white children lived			2
they said they expect to find more graves here , with the boys also segregated in death			0
@entity90 - @entity90 children at the school were three times more likely to be buried in an unspecified location than the white boys , the report found			1
' i did n't realise going in how much of a story of civil rights it was , ' @entity191 , an assistant professor of anthropology at the university , told reporters			0
seven boys are believed to have died following escape attempts , according to the report among the children who were overlooked was a white boy named @entity203 , who died of blunt head trauma			2
records claimed he died away from the campus after he escaped			2
the school records claim that boys who escaped happened to meet a violent death , including two who died of gunshot wounds to the chest or head			2
former students of the @entity13 , now aged 60 or older have told horror stories of how they were beaten as boys , in the 1940s , 1950s and 1960s			1
discovery : @entity10 radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses @entity222 , now 83 , said that her brother , @entity223 , was sent to the @entity13 for boys in the spring of 1940 , after running away from home and later stealing and wrecking a car			1
according to a 2009 letter written by @entity229 , the family never heard from @entity223 again			0
she said that her mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son ’s whereabouts , but was told @entity223 escaped			2
the school then said he was caught and captured by the sheriff ’s department			2
when their father came to claim his son , he was told that he was sent back to @entity105			0
it is unclear what then happened to @entity223			0
mrs @entity229 said that she talked to a former student who said that he saw @entity223 being taken into what was known as the @entity13 , a place where boys were disciplined on campus			2
victims : officials said the body of @entity223 , left , was found decomposing under a house after he ran away			2
@entity252 , far right , died of pneumonia 34 days after his arrival - yet his family said he was healthy school grounds : scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves ongoing : researchers will look at a different area in january , where the white boys were buried she wrote : ‘ when they brought him out , they were carrying him			1
the boy said they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary			0
’ mrs @entity229 ’s mother continued to write to the detention centre for months , until the school finally said that @entity223 ’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house			2
the school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm			0
however , the doctor and lawyer living in the house told mrs @entity229 that they never heard or smelled anything			0
mrs @entity229 told @entity286 that she hopes to give her brother the burial he deserves			0
' i would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery , ' she explained			0
' i hope i get the chance			0

@entity13 opened as a reform school in 1900 but was closed in 2011 amid decades - long allegations of physical and sexual abuse
31 white crosses at school cemetery - but 50 grave shafts found
scientists believe there is a second burial site and research continues
found a total of 98 deaths at the school - but could be many more as records after the 1960s fall under privacy laws
