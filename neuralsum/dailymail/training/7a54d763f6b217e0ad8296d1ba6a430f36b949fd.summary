by @entity0 last updated at 2:21 pm on 14th december 2011 the head of the @entity2 yesterday blamed the deluge of criticism about its ‘ faked ’ scenes of polar bear cubs on newspaper bitterness over the corporation ’s comprehensive coverage of the phone - hacking inquiry			1
director - general @entity11 suggested the issue of the misleading @entity14 footage was being used as a way of retaliating against the @entity2 for its reporting of the @entity18 inquiry into press standards			1
‘ i do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about @entity18 and other matters , ’ he said			1
it was shown in an episode of @entity14 on november 2 not quite so natural : as the caterpillar gets colder , its breathing stops before finally its gut and blood freeze misleading : when the caterpillar thaws again , it scurries off			1
some of the footage was doctored for the programme the @entity2 filmed deadly spiders in @entity40 for its documentary @entity41 earlier this year , it has emerged			1
the programme showed children hunting @entity44 tarantulas in @entity45 for food - but close - ups of the world 's largest spiders were filmed in the @entity40 using tame spiders			1
during the show this was not explained and it was not mentioned in the ' making of ' film at the end either			2
the details were located in a @entity58 called ' @entity59 ' on the programme 's website , the @entity56 said			2
a @entity2 spokesman said ' we only ever use footage filmed in controlled conditions in extreme circumstances - for example when it 's too dangerous '			1
mr @entity11 also said viewers had already effectively given it the go - ahead to fake scenes in natural history shows without telling them			1
millions thought the scene had been captured by @entity2 cameramen inside an underground cave in the sub-zero temperatures of the @entity80 wilderness			0
but the footage , narrated by sir @entity82 , and interspersed with real shots of the @entity80 , was in fact filmed in a den made of plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure at a @entity90 zoo			1
appearing before @entity91 yesterday to answer questions over the @entity2 ’s annual report , mr @entity11 played down the controversy about the footage in the @entity97 episode of the hit wildlife series			1
the director - general said the @entity2 would not be re-editing the show ’s commentary , adding that the corporation had done audience research and that viewers were fine with the practice			2
he told mps on the @entity107 : ‘ some years ago we asked the public the specific question of whether they would prefer it if there were on - air mentions , either captions or labels , and the overwhelming response of the public is they did not want us to do that			0
‘ they were quite happy with the idea of us simply explaining where we can after the programme , always on the website , how we do it , so those who want to know how it is made can find out			0
’ on thin ice : sir @entity82 with an anaesthetised polar bear in @entity128 during episode seven of the hit show @entity14 preparing for the new arrivals : the fake nest being built in a @entity90 zoo , ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs not as it seems : the ' den ' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood , built below the zoo 's polar bear enclosure			1
it was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth he claimed it had ‘ talked to the public ’ and ‘ sought their advice ’ and that they ‘ understand ’ , provided the commentary is ‘ written extremely carefully ’ and was ‘ generic ’			0
but @entity154 mp @entity153 said she was one of those that ‘ did believe that the extraordinary coverage of the polar bears was genuine ’			0
she said the @entity2 had ‘ spoilt ’ the ‘ fantastic ’ programme , adding : ‘ for me i will probably never look at a @entity2 nature programme in the same way , [ but instead ] to see , was it trick cameras			0
’ mr @entity11 then turned his fire on newspaper coverage of the issue			1
he said : ‘ all i would say is there is a leader in today ’s mirror that is quite interesting – “ the national broadcaster is quick on the draw when it comes to pointing fingers at others			0
perhaps when it comes to their own editorial standards and ethics a little more action and a little less pontificating would be handy ”			0
‘ i do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about @entity18 and other matters			1
’ moving scene : the pair of two - day - old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary			2
at this age they weighed less than a kilo , but were filmed in a zoo the polar bear and cub inside the man - made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow faked ? what the viewers saw on @entity14 turned out not to be filmed in the wild , but in a @entity90 zoo mixed : the scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild , which may have misled viewers @entity205 : the @entity2 apologised in june after it was found ‘ likely ’ that @entity205 had faked scenes of boys said to be working in an @entity209 sweatshop			1
@entity210 : @entity2 fined £ 50,000 in june 2007 after a young studio guest posed as a caller when the telephone system failed during a 2006 phone - in			0
@entity215 : a fictitious winner ’s details were broadcast during @entity215 on @entity218 in november 2005 after no calls came through from the public			0
a year with the queen : @entity2 apologised to the @entity221 in 2007 after a trailer wrongly implied that she had stormed out of a sitting with photographer @entity223			0
the @entity224 : @entity225 found to have repeatedly faked competitions where no prizes existed and that callers had been members of the production team or their friends			0
@entity2 chairman @entity231 told the committee the fakery had probably only come to light as a result of an item on the show ’s website which explained how the images were achieved			0
sir @entity82 , 85 , has also defended the methods used by @entity14			1
he said : ‘ if you had tried to put a camera in the wild in a polar bear den , she would either have killed the cub or the cameraman			0
’ mr @entity11 and @entity231 also faced a call from @entity251 mp @entity250 to sack @entity252 over his comments on the one show about striking public sector workers being shot			2
@entity231 said the @entity257 presenter and the one show had apologised for the remarks			2
mr @entity11 said : ‘ i do n’t intend to sack him because in my view the remarks were clearly intended as a joke			2
’ conservative mp @entity264 attacked the @entity2 ’s coverage of @entity266 , saying he had seen research which showed that a minuscule percentage of guests on news programmes were from a point of view that the @entity40 should withdraw from the @entity266 project			0
mr @entity11 replied that voices of scepticism could be heard ‘ morning , noon and night ’ across the @entity2 ’s network			2
' the documentary drew in eight million viewers transfixed by moving scenes of a polar cub being born this is not the first time sir @entity82 has been accused of misleading viewers in his wildlife documentaries			1
in 1997 , in the most memorable scene of @entity286 , @entity287 , a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn cub			2
viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the @entity80			0
in fact , it was filmed in a zoo in @entity296 , @entity297			0
in 2001 , sir @entity82 was accused of using deceptive techniques in @entity300 when it included a lobster spawning scene that was filmed in a @entity40 aquarium			1
viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the coast of @entity308			0
and in 2008 , sir @entity82 was accused of staging a confrontation between himself and a cobra in a @entity312 desert for the series , @entity314 .			1

@entity11 suggests criticism misleading footage comes from bitterness about @entity320 's reporting of the @entity18 inquiry
