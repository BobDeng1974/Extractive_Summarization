by @entity0 for @entity1 a bid to win favour at a strip club went disastrously wrong for a man who claimed he was @entity6 's son - when staff realised the boy in question is only 17			1
despite wielding a fabled @entity12 black card , the mystery partier was reportedly thrown out of the @entity14 venue as soon as curious bouncers looked up the teenager on @entity17			1
according to the report in the @entity20 , the spurned clubber shouted : ' i ’m not going to be arrested			0
no one ’s going to arrest me ! ' , before racing to a waiting car			0
bold : a man reportedly claimed he was @entity25 ( right ) , the son of @entity28 director @entity26 ( left ) , to get into a strip club - but he was busted when staff looked @entity25 up on @entity17 and realised he is only 17 @entity28 legend @entity6 , 57 , whose directing credits include @entity32 ( 1992 ) and he got @entity33 ( 1998 ) , has two children with his wife of more than 20 years @entity36			1
his daughter @entity38 was born in 1994 while his son @entity25 was born in 1997 , putting both well under the legal drinking age of 21			2
a source told the newspaper the party - goer dropped @entity25 's name when he arrived at @entity46 's @entity45 in the early hours last week , and showed an id which said he was 22 years old			2
then , the report claimed , he placed the $ 60 entry fee on an @entity50 , better known as the invitation - only ' black card ' whose users earn an average of $ 1.3million			1
its users must spend at least $ 250,000 a year - and even then it 'll cost them an annual fee of $ 2,500 along with a $ 7,500 initiation fee			0
but @entity25 's mother told the @entity20 the man at the club was not her son , adding any suggestion that he was would be a ' bald - faced lie '			1
what a hustler : the man flashed an @entity50 at @entity46 's @entity45 in @entity14 it would not be the first time a fake celebrity has caused a stir in @entity14			1
two years ago 21 - year - old student @entity72 hired fake bodyguards , paparazzi and an entourage to follow him around the streets of @entity77 in a bid to fool people into thinking he was famous			2
it worked - and he caused a crush of 300 people while posing for photographs with groups of giggling girls			0
he later said it was a ' social experiment , ' which showed ' how our culture is so obsessed with celebrity and fame '			0
widely hailed as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation , @entity6 has devoted his film career to tales of urban poverty , inequality and race relations			0
he has twice been nominated for an @entity100 , the first for @entity102 ( 1989 ) and the second for 4 @entity104 ( 1997 ) .			0
