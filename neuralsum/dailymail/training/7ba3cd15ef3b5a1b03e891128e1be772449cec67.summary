but few could rival @entity226 's extraordinary tale			0
it was the torpedo he fired that crippled the rudder of the @entity11 battleship , leaving it at the mercy of @entity55 ships which then sank it			0
he was piloting one of three @entity42 open - cockpit biplanes that set off from the aircraft carrier @entity176 to take vengeance			1
' what nobody talks about were the conditions - they were unbelievable , ' recalled mr @entity226 , speaking in 2009			0
then aged 89 , he had written a book , i sank the @entity12 , about his experiences			2
' the ship was pitching 60ft , water was running over the decks and the wind was blowing at 70 or 80mph			0
@entity226 is credited with taking off from @entity250 and launching the torpedo from his swordfish that disabled the rudder of the @entity12 ' and nobody mentions the deck hands who had to bring the planes up from the hangars - they did something special			1
after they brought them up they had to open the wings which took ten men for each wing			0
and then they had to wind a handle to get the starters working			0
' i only stopped flying nine months ago and there are no other planes in the world that could have done what the @entity42 planes did that day			2
' after take - off we climbed to 6,000ft to get above the really thick cloud and we knew when we were near because all hell broke loose with @entity12 's fire			1
we got the order to attack and i went down and saw the enormous bloody ship			0
i thought the @entity176 was big , but this one , blimey			0
' i must have been under 2,000 yards when i was about to launch the torpedo at the bow , but as i was about to press the button i heard in my ear " not now , not now "			0
' i turned round and saw the navigator leaning right out of the plane with his backside in the air			0
' then i realised what he was doing - he was looking at the sea because if i had let the torpedo go and it had hit a wave it could have gone anywhere			0
i had to put it in a trough			0
' then i heard him say " let it go " and i pressed the button			0
then i heard him say " we 've got a runner " - and i got out of there			0
' my navigator was a chap called @entity308 and i 've spent the last 20 years trying to find out what happened to him or where he is			0
' mr @entity226 pulled up before the torpedo hit and did n't see it strike			0
the following morning he flew to the ship for a second attack but there was no need			0
he watched as the @entity12 , which had been under siege from the @entity55 , rolled over			2
and he saw hundreds of @entity11 sailors leaping into the water as she started to sink			0
only 115 of @entity12 's crew of 2,222 survived			2
' i did n't dare look any further , i just got back to the @entity176 and i thought : " there but for the grace of @entity326 go i " , ' said mr @entity226 , from @entity327 , @entity328			0
he only found out it was his torpedo that crippled the @entity12 when the @entity330 - the @entity55 's air force - wrote to him in 2000			2
he said : ' it gave me a sort of satisfaction			0
' the @entity12 was built in august 1940 and was the biggest battleship made by @entity11			1
she was named after @entity336 , the @entity11 chancellor behind the unification of @entity11 in 1871			0
despite her fearsome reputation , the @entity12 enjoyed just an eight - month career during which time she was involved in one offensive operation , when she destroyed @entity13			1
out nearly 3,000 shells fired at @entity12 by the @entity55 , about 400 hit the ship before she finally sunk			2
the @entity12 's sister ship the @entity345 wreaked havoc among the @entity348 convoys until she was sunk while at anchor in a @entity351 fjord			2
the @entity12 had a maximum weight of 51,000 tons , was 823ft long and had a top speed of 34mph .			2
