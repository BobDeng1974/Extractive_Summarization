by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:12 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 17:36 est , 9 august 2012 it was a fitting tribute to a games that has seen @entity4 claim its biggest gold medal haul for more than a century			1
just two days after helping to take home the nation ’s first - ever dressage medal of any colour , @entity6 also became @entity4 ’s first individual @entity12 champion in the discipline			1
and she did it all to the patriotic strains of @entity17 , i vow to @entity18 , my country – and even the theme tune to @entity21 and the chimes of @entity23			1
gold medallist @entity6 celebrates after her victory in the @entity25 took @entity4 's gold medal tally to 23 @entity6 wins @entity27 for @entity28 in the @entity29 at @entity30 @entity6 of @entity4 riding ' @entity31 ' in tears after winning the gold medal @entity6 salutes the crowd from the top step of the podium , flanked by @entity37 , who won bronze the 26 - year - old former stable hand , who left school at 16 to pursue her dreams of equestrian success , wept as her near - perfect score of 90.089 per cent flashed up on the spectators ’ screens yesterday			1
amid joyous scenes at @entity30 , @entity49 , the 23,000 - strong crowd roared as the new golden girl of dressage , which tests the understanding between horse and rider as they complete a series of manoeuvres , collected her medal			1
kissing her horse @entity31 on the nose , she revealed : ‘ this is what dreams are made of and there are no words to describe it			1
’ @entity6 and @entity31 during their routine , which was set to patriotic classics and went down a storm with the crowd and judges @entity6 wipes away a tear after completing her routine at @entity30 an embrace between the gold medal winner @entity6 and bronze winner @entity37 on the podium the equestrian venue at @entity30 was once again packed for the @entity25 event this afternoon delight : @entity86 fans wave @entity87 and cheer on @entity6 and her teammates during the dressage fellow briton @entity37 , 27 , the granddaughter of a @entity91 billionaire , also brought home the bronze after performing to a medley of @entity96 tracks including @entity97			1
it means @entity4 ’s riders have won three gold medals in three days , including one for showjumping and another for the dressage team event , in which the two women took part alongside @entity106			1
miss @entity6 ’s success is all the more remarkable given her humble background , which sets her apart from the wealth of the horsey set , and the fact she only began competing at this level 18 months ago			1
brought up in @entity113 , north - west @entity49 , she first became interested in horses after riding her mother ’s @entity116 ponies			0
the emotion gets a little too much for @entity6 after she collects her gold medal @entity6 received a massive score from the judges and ran straight to her mum @entity122 to celebrate she was only able to buy her first grand prix horse after inheriting some money following the death of her grandmother			1
her parents @entity122 and @entity127 own a horse rug washing business called @entity130 at their home in @entity132 , @entity133			0
she recalls of the £ 18,000 horse called @entity135 : ‘ my parents do n’t have a lot of money and it was only through my mum ’s mum dying , and with her inheritance money we managed to buy @entity135 at a sale			0
‘ i started in a showing background			0
i was very lucky we had ponies			0
we had to produce ponies , make them into something , because we never had the money for top ponies			0
double gold : @entity6 shows off her second gold for @entity28 in the @entity25 @entity37 with her bronze medal - the @entity91 - born 27 - year - old was in the lead for a short time ‘ @entity156 was very good at spotting a cheap one that was also a good one , i learned from that , so @entity156 taught me a lot			1
’ she later sold the horse to raise the funds to buy a house with her fiancé @entity164 , a decision she said was the ‘ hardest thing – saying goodbye to my best friend in the whole world ’			0
miss @entity6 has won her two olympic gold medals on @entity31 , which is owned by @entity170 , one of the country ’s top trainers			1
she asked if she could have ten days ’ work experience in his yard in @entity176 , @entity177 – and never left			0
golden girl : double gold medal winner @entity6 out of her dressage clothes @entity170 allowed her to ride @entity31 as a novice because she was unable to buy her own pedigree and the pair did so well together that he decided to let her keep him – sparking a golden partnership			1
some commentators have spoken of the ‘ telepathic ’ relationship both horse and rider seem to share			2
miss @entity6 ’s sister @entity190 , 29 , yesterday said the family were hoping to be able to raise enough money to buy @entity31			1
she added : ‘ she always said that at her first @entity12 she would win gold and she did			1
it has n’t sunk in she ’s really done it			0
‘ it ’s very emotional for her because it could be the last ride on @entity31			2
we want to win the lottery and buy him for her			0
she is a very , very special sister and we are incredibly proud of her			0
’ miss @entity6 also admitted to being ‘ naughty ’ as a teenager			2
she dropped out of her comprehensive school in @entity203 , @entity204 , at 16 after telling her parents that ‘ school ’s not going to teach me to ride any better ’			0
yesterday , she told reporters she ‘ did n’t really attend school as you can probably tell ’			0
@entity170 has also spoken of how he had spotted her talent ‘ straight away ’ and offered to give her a job as a stable girl			0
sadly , the 45 - year - old missed out on his own medal yesterday when he came fifth on another of his horses , @entity218			2
last night , he said he was ‘ very proud ’ of @entity219 , adding : ‘ i always said @entity220 was the gold medallist			0
‘ @entity31 is the best horse in the world , just the consummate professional			1
’ miss @entity6 , who lives with her partner and their boxer dog @entity228 in a cottage on @entity170 ’s estate in @entity176 , @entity177 , said that the horse ‘ means the world to me ’			1
yesterday , miss @entity37 also burst into tears at the end of her routine			1
she said her performance was ‘ definitely the best ride i have had ’ and that her mount , @entity239 , whom she calls @entity241 , had been ‘ just on the button ’			0
the wealthy heiress said it was ‘ the first music @entity241 had really seemed to enjoy dancing to ’ , adding : ‘ he ’s 17 years old and he has given me so much			0
he was so beautiful to ride			0
‘ it ’s not a tennis racket , it ’s a living animal , and when they fight for you like that it ’s very emotional			0
’ these are the only podium places @entity4 has ever won in the discipline since dressage became an @entity12 sport more than 100 years ago			1
it brings @entity28 ’s @entity12 medal tally in equestrian sports to five , double their previous record			1
the @entity86 team may now be the reigning @entity12 dressage champions but spectators would be forgiven for wondering what this most rarefied of equine sports is all about			1
the discipline dubbed " horse dancing " may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping , but it is a highly technical test for both horse and rider			2
today 's event , the individual freestyle to music , was dressage in its most elevated form			2
the contest allows the rider to choreograph a routine which must combine a certain number of complex movements within a six minute time frame			1
this is then set to music which should complement the performance			0
@entity287 of the @entity288 competes in the @entity29 dressage today - the event requires years of practice and an amazing affinity between rider and horse each rider is marked on his or her technical and artistic expertise , with judges scrutinising rhythm , harmony and the choice of music			1
higher points are likely to be awarded when riders attempt particularly challenging manoeuvres			0
of particular note is the pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle , with its hind - quarters at the centre - and the piaffe , a highly collected and cadenced trot where the horse remains in one place			2
in each case , the rider must put his or her mount through its paces , performing more complex movements than are seen in the team event			2
producing these results takes years of training as a horse must learn to respond to a series of hand and leg signals			2
over time , it will come to associate tiny shifts in the rider 's position with certain movements			2
the objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant partnerships			0
the goal should always be to achieve harmony between horse and rider , with the animal showing a willingness to perform			2
a routine should not look forced and riders can use any music they wish - with the competition showcasing everything from @entity347 to @entity348			2
the use of sound effects , such as @entity6 's decision to incorporate the chimes of @entity23 - is also encouraged			1
results are determined by combining both technical and artistic marks and the final score is shown as a percentage			0
dressage has been an @entity12 sport since 1912			0
it was a discipline reserved for army officers until 1952 when it became a mixed event .			0

@entity86 rider and horse @entity31 do *n't* put a foot *wrong* in very @entity86 six - minute routine to claim 23rd gold of the @entity12
music included ' @entity17 ' , ' i vow to @entity18 , my country ' and the chimes of @entity23
fellow @entity373 @entity37 takes the bronze medal
it 's @entity6 's 2nd gold of @entity377 , after she won team gold with @entity37 and @entity106
success for @entity382 , and a 24th gold , follows soon after
