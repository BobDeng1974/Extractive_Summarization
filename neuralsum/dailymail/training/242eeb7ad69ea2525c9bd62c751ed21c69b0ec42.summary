by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 and @entity3 celebrated their engagement after the date that never happened 32 years ago a couple who reunited through @entity1 have tied the knot more than three decades after one stood the other up			1
@entity2 , 48 , from @entity10 got over the fact that @entity3 , 50 , stood her up 32 years ago and the pair showed that there were no hard feelings by getting married			1
but things did not go smoothly between them at first			0
the couple first met on holiday in @entity19 , @entity10 in 1982 and were inseparable until @entity3 , then 19 , left a heartbroken 17 - year - old @entity2 alone at the bus station			1
however , @entity2 said that as the years passed by she never forget about @entity21			1
in 2013 , over 30 years since he stood her up , she did a random search on a social networking site for fishing pole repair services and ws shocked to find him			1
she quickly sent a friend request and soon the pair had rekindled that initial summer loving feeling			1
the reunited couple delighted friends and family by getting married exactly 18 months after she sent the friend request to her first love on @entity1			1
they tied the knot in front of 61 people			0
@entity2 said : ' it was more than i ever expected - a real fairytale wedding			2
' i had a big white dress and everything			0
' it 's hard to believe that after all these years apart we 've got back together and we 're now married			2
' @entity2 said that she had spent years trying to locate @entity3 after he stood her up , and originally started by wandering around @entity44 - where he was from - but to no avail			1
in later years she took to @entity47 and looked through old school records before they finally met again			0
@entity2 recalled : ' we met as teenagers in @entity19 in 1982 - i was 17 and @entity52 was 19			2
i was from @entity53 and he was from @entity44			0
' we spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the sunday			0
wedding : @entity2 and @entity3 share a laugh on their wedding day just 18 months after she sent him a friend request ' i arrived to meet @entity52 in @entity63 bus station and waited two hours but he never came to meet me and i was devastated			1
@entity64 : the newlyweds have now returned from a week 's honeymoon in @entity67 , @entity68 and could n't be happier ' in the year that followed , i looked for @entity3 in various places in @entity44 but never found him			2
' the months turned into years and @entity3 was always in my mind			1
' i searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end			0
' the newlyweds have now returned from a week 's honeymoon in @entity67 , @entity68 and could n't be happier			0
that happiness seems to have cleared @entity21 's memory of the reason he stood up @entity2 in the first place			2
the 50 - year - old said : ' i have no idea why i did n't turn up to meet her - i really ca n't remember			0
' i only joined @entity1 to promote my fishing pole repair business and i never normally accept friend requests from women unless they have something to do with fishing			2
' for some reason i assumed she was involved with fishing so i clicked to accept it and within seconds she had sent me a message			0
' things very quickly just clicked into place and we both decided we wanted to be together			0
' it was just too good to be true			0
we both knew we had met the right person - i only wish i 'd known that 30 years ago			1

@entity2 , 48 , was stood up by @entity3 , 50 , over 32 years ago
but she never forgot him and *tracked* him down on @entity1 in 2013
she sent him a friend request on the social media site and they reunited
just 18 months later , the pair got married and have ' never been happier '
