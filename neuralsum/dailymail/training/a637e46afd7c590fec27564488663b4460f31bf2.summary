serial object destroyer @entity3 , from @entity5 , has turned his twisted attention to exploding much - loved toys			1
the high - speed photography fanatic has selected children 's favourites and destroyed them with firecrackers			1
serial object destroyer @entity3 has turned his twisted attention to exploding much - loved toys with explosive results mr @entity13 gets a baking and @entity15 , from much loved series @entity16 , looks a little worse for wear poor old @entity19 blows his top after mr @entity3 turns his attention to him @entity22 clings on to a flowerpot for dear life as he is destroyed with firecrackers and thanks to his photographic expertise , the 57 - year - old has managed to capture the moment the poor playthings were blown apart			1
unfortunate toys and characters include a @entity19 mug blowing its top , @entity22 losing his head , a troll head cracking up and a @entity37 exploding into pieces			1
mr @entity3 , from @entity39 , @entity5 , explains : ' the poor defenseless toys are common so i pick them up from garage sales			1
i try my best to keep the costs under a dollar per shot			2
' i will admit that it is fun to mess with toy archetypes			2
i have to smile when an icon of sweet innocence like @entity53 crumbles to pieces in rather horrifying way			1
' to blow up the objects @entity57 uses a firecracker modified so that it can be fired using an electrical signal			2
mr @entity3 said he smiles when toys such as dolls ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) are destroyed in a ' horrifying way ' it is not just toys like @entity65 ( left ) that fall foul of mr @entity3 's wrath			1
a @entity2 ornament gets the explosion treatment too serial object destroyer @entity3 has turned his twisted attention to exploding much - loved toys he then has to synchronise the opening of the camera shutter with the explosion			1
it does not need to be really accurate , but it does need to be better than lighting a fuse			2
' the camera is unimportant , it 's not a special camera			0
i use a @entity82 for most of my shots			0
i have also used an old @entity85 film camera , a @entity86 , @entity84 etc. ' the camera must have a manual focus and manual settings is all			0
' the flash is the key , that and the detector / trigger			0
' i use a home built flash based on a model built in the 1950s by @entity96			0
' the flash is really fast about 1 millionth of a second and it stops the action			0
' the detector / trigger is also critical			0
' it detects that the debris from the explosion has arrived and fires the flash at just the right moment			0
' and it is not just toys which appear to test mr @entity3 's patience			1
the eccentric photographer has in the past turned his lens , and his gun , to a range of different foods , shooting items such as @entity116 and @entity117 cheese at close range and catching the fall out on camera			0
the artist 's studio looks like something from a horror film even the @entity126 camera was not safe from his explosion obsession a @entity128 with a very different ending for this doll ( left ) and this children 's dvd which features scenes of toys in a similar state			0

favourites such as mr @entity13 , @entity53 , and @entity19 all blasted with explosives
@entity3 , 57 , admits : ' i have to smile when an icon of sweet innocence like @entity53 crumbles to pieces in rather horrifying way '
