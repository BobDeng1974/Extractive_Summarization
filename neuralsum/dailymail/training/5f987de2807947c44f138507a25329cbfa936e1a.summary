not this year : those who introduced the ban in 2012 affected the usage habits of 20million people water users are unlikely to face hosepipe bans this year , authorities said today			1
a year ago , rate payers in some pockets of the @entity4 were in the puzzling situation of having to endure water restrictions at a time of widespread heavy rainfall which contributed to 2012 being the second wettest year on record			1
those who introduced the ban last year affected the usage habits of 20million people			0

‘ ( last year ) was the second wettest year on record , and despite a relatively dry start to 2013 , river levels are normal or above normal at the majority of our monitoring sites			0
‘ the results show a positive picture even if rainfall is below average and point to the risk of drought this summer being no greater than average			0
‘ however it is still as important as ever to use water wisely			0
