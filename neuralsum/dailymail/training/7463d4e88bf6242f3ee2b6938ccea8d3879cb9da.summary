by @entity0 when @entity2 and his wife @entity3 were convicted of in 2013 of lighting the fire that destroyed their home and resulted in the death of their six innocent children , the entire country was baying for the couple 's blood			1
but no one wishes that @entity2 was dead more than @entity3 's father , and grandfather of the dead children , @entity14 , who has spoken in a tv interview to be shown on sunday night			1
speaking in an episode of @entity18 , @entity14 says that he 'd ' like to kill the man for what he ’s done to them children and what he ’s done to my daughter			1
' see below for video @entity14 with daughter @entity27 arriving to the trial of his daughter @entity2 in 2012 @entity14 puts what his daughter did down to her husband 's abusive and controlling behaviour @entity14 puts what his daughter did down to her husband 's abusive and controlling behaviour			1
' i blame him for the way she was and the way she is now and what she ’s done			2
' if it was up to me i ’d strangle the man tomorrow if i was given half a chance			2
' the episode , which details the crime , also includes reflections from neighbours @entity46 and @entity47 , who were present the night of the fire			2
@entity3 was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for manslaughter for her part in lighting the fire at her children 's home , and attempting to blame the arson on husband @entity2 's ex-lover @entity56			1
the jailed couple were married in 2003 , but @entity14 says that he had misgivings about @entity2 from the beginning the pair married in 2003 , and in the episode @entity14 recalls that from the beginning he had misgivings about his son - in - law			1
' [ at their wedding ] he seemed to be mingling around everywhere in among the women , stuff like that there and half the time she was sitting there on her own , and he was nowhere near her			0
i said to him ‘ you ’re supposed to be with your wife today			0
you ’re going round all these women ’			0
and he did quite annoy me but i was in two minds of saying i ’m going to whack him one , but i decided not to ruin the day kind of thing , so i just kind of bit my tongue and left it at that			0
' speaking in @entity18 , @entity14 says that he 'd ' like to kill the man for what he ’s done ' in the aftermath of the fire in may 2012 , @entity2 and @entity3 appeared on tv to talk about the incident , but even then something did n't seem right to @entity14			1
' to me it was a show because i could n’t see a tear			0
i never heard a mention of the children or ‘ find out who done this to my children			0
’ ' i thought to myself , ‘ what ’s wrong with the man ? ’ six children are dead ; somebody set the house on fire			0
no mention of the children ; no sign of a tear			0
' i do n’t think there was a tear coming out of @entity3 ’s eye either			2
but she just sat there with her head down , clinging on to him			0
' @entity3 and @entity2 speak to the media in @entity115 , 2012 , following the fire that killed six of their children once their crime was discovered , @entity2 , @entity3 and co-conspirator @entity2 underwent an eight week trial , at the end of which they were all found guilty and sentenced , @entity2 to life imprisonment and @entity3 and @entity2 to 17 years each			1
however , @entity14 believes that sentencing should have been harsher , saying that some of the spectators in court believed the couple should have received an individual sentence for each of the six children who died			2
despite saying he ' ca n't forgive ' @entity133 for her actions , @entity14 says that she 's ' still my daughter , i still love her ' and worries that he might somehow be responsible for what happened			1
' some nights i sit back and think what did i do wrong that she turned out the way she did ? you know , i blame myself sometimes			0
