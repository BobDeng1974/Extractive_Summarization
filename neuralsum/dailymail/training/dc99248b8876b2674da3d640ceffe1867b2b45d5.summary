by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 05:05 est , 17 september 2012 the cyclist shot dead in the @entity5 may have been the ‘ main target ’ of the massacre , @entity3 police say – not the @entity9 al - hilli family			1
investigators made the extraordinary claim as @entity12 , who worked in the nuclear industry , was ‘ temporarily buried ’ in a secret ceremony yesterday			1
this went against the wishes of the 45 - year - old ’s family , who had asked for him to be cremated			2
crime scene : the bullet - riddled @entity20 where the bodies of @entity22 , his wife , @entity25 , and mother - in - law @entity26 were discovered along with his daughters @entity27 and @entity30 it is believed forensic experts still want to examine his body for clues , which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed			2
just 30 people attended the funeral , which took place at 6.30pm last night - a day when the burial site is normally closed			2
it was deliberately kept hidden from the media , employees told @entity3 broadcaster @entity44			1
@entity3 investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘ double life ’ and been the intended target of the shooting			1
until now the investigation had focused on the deaths of @entity9 aerospace engineer @entity22 , 50 , his wife @entity55 , 47 , and his mother - in - law @entity56 , 74 , who were shot in the countryside near @entity58 in their @entity20 estate car			2
mr @entity61 ’s seven - year - old daughter @entity30 was discovered badly beaten by a passing @entity9 cyclist shortly after the attack			2
burial : relatives of @entity12 at @entity67 after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation her four - year - old sister , @entity27 , was found unscathed hiding under her dead mother ’s skirt eight hours later			1
the family , from @entity74 , @entity75 , had been camping near @entity58 when they were attacked			0
victim : @entity22 , 50 , the father murdered near the village of @entity80 , near @entity58 , in the @entity82 region of @entity3 it had been thought that mr @entity12 was killed because he witnessed the shootings as he cycled past			1
but lt colonel @entity85 , who is leading the gendarme inquiry , revealed he was considering other possibilities			0
he said : ‘ was the @entity61 family the main target ? was it not the cyclist ? only ongoing work on the scene can answer this question clearly			0
‘ we ’re talking about someone whom everybody says was a gentleman , but who ’s to say he did not lead a double life ? ’ mr @entity12 worked for @entity99 , a subsidiary of the @entity101 , specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers			1
@entity99 is owned by the @entity101 which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in @entity105 that it had flouted @entity107 sanctions by providing @entity108 with enriched uranium			0
he lived in @entity67 , close to the isolated beauty spot on the edge of the village of @entity80 where the shootings took place			0
he had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his second wife , a pharmacist , gave birth in june			0
mr @entity12 was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside			1
he was identified after his partner , worried about not seeing him return , alerted the police			0
the two survivors , @entity30 and @entity27 , are back in @entity9 and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near @entity127			0
