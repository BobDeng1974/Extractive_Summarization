by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 07:19 est , 25 july 2013 a 25 stone man has shed almost half his body weight after cutting out the carbs			1
@entity4 , 46 , ate up to 70 slices of bread a week - and piled on the pounds as a result			1
now the sandwich addict has finally beaten the habit and has shed a massive nine stone			1
@entity4 , ate his way through 20 loaves per month , which is 11,200 calories in bread alone			1
carb addict : @entity4 used to eat up to 70 slices of bread a week - the equivalent of 20 loaves per month slimmer : @entity4 's love affair with bread left him tipping the scales at 25 stone before he gave it up bread ban : @entity4 can now fit into most of his wardrobe but could n't when he was a carb addict instead of tucking into his favourite peanut butter and marmite sandwiches , @entity24 now plumps for healthier fare such as weetabix and jacket potatoes and has also cut out sweets and other fattening treats			1
' i started putting the weight on when i got my first job in @entity35 in 1987 , ' revealed @entity4			1
' i moved from @entity36 to @entity35 and there was food everywhere - @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41			1
' socialising always revolved around drinking and eating			0
i 've been on a few diets and have lost up to six stone , but for one reason or another i 've always put it back on			2
' i loved bread , i 'd always eat at least 10 slices a day - sometimes all in one sitting			2
' despite his unhealthy diet , @entity24 only realised matters had gotten out of hand when he discovered he 'd grown too big for everything in his wardrobe but his work uniform and a pair of elasticated jogging bottoms			2
the @entity61 employee said : ' i used to love peanut butter and marmite sandwiches - i 'd be eating 10 slices for my breakfast alone at the weekend			2
' but when i got invited to a work @entity65 , i realised the only clothes that fitted me were my work uniform , three tops and my jogging bottoms			0
' i was fat , sweaty and unhealthy			0
i thought enough was enough			0
now i 'm much more confident and happier with myself			0
' fattening : they might not look much but together , 70 slices of white bread add up to a whopping 2,800 calories moderation : although he has n't given up bread entirely , he 's swapped sandwiches for brown toast and marmite prodded into action by the sartorial shock , @entity4 joined his local @entity82 and , 18 months later , weighs just 16 stone			1
instead of feasting on carbs , he now enjoys healthy home - cooked meals and has swapped his lunchtime sandwiches for salad			0
along with looking better , the new diet has left @entity24 feeling better too			0
he used to suffer from high blood pressure and painful joints , but now his blood pressure has fallen and he no longer suffers from a bad back or joint pain			0
he said : ' before i would get the bus everywhere , now i can walk to work and i even bought a bike for the first time in 30 years			0
' despite the healthy new lifestyle , @entity4 , who now has plenty of clothes that fits and three @entity102 parties already lined up this year , has n't entirely quit the carbohydrates			2
' i love carbs and this way i can still eat them , ' he admits , before adding : ' but i do n't eat sandwiches any more			1
' if i want bread i have brown with @entity110 , and if i get a craving for peanut butter i have a healthy peanut bar instead			0
' binned : now he 's ditched the carb habit , @entity4 says he 's happier - and healthier - than ever breakfast : two breakfast sandwiches or 10 slices of peanut butter on toast lunch : two cheese and onion sandwiches , crisps and chocolate dinner : chilli con carne or spaghetti bolognese , one or two large bars of chocolate snack : toast with peanut butter or cheese @entity133 : two litres of diet coke breakfast : @entity135 with raspberries , porridge or a full @entity138 lunch : jacket potato with tuna salad or rice with baked beans and chopped onion dinner : chilli con carne or spaghetti bolognese with @entity146 mince snack : fruit and yoghurt @entity133 : water or squash			1

@entity4 , 46 , weighed 25 stone and ate 70 slices of bread per week
70 slices per week is 20 loaves each month
his love of carbs added 2,800 calories to his diet every seven days
now @entity4 , from @entity36 , has *kicked* the habit and lost nine stone as a result
