by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 26 september 2013 @entity1 is the the home of high - octane glamour , while @entity4 has the edgy young talent - but for the big names , only @entity7 , the grande dame of fashion , will do			1
this season 's shows got off to a sunny start , courtesy of up - and - coming name @entity15 whose s / @entity17 offering was unveiled on a rooftop with stunning views of the @entity20 behind			0
the collection itself was a composed effort in cobalt , white and grey , with sports - inspired tailoring and loose flowing maxis setting the tone			2
vive la @entity30 : @entity15 's s / @entity17 collection was backdropped by stunning views of the @entity20 sheer genius : @entity34 's vision included plenty of delicate chiffon and a fluid sihouette @entity37 , who previously worked for @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , has only been designing since 2008 but already has numerous awards to her name - and the new collection showed why			2
elsewhere , @entity46 actor @entity45 appeared on the catwalk at @entity7 ' inaugural @entity48 where @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 unveiled designs tailored for those who want to cover up			0
but the star of today 's show was undoubtedly @entity37 , whose elegant ensembles shimmered in the warm september sunshine			0
talented though @entity37 is , @entity7 does n't really get going until later this week , starting with @entity60 tomorrow , where rumours that creative director @entity62 is leaving for @entity63 have dogged the run - up to the show			1
thursday sees the first of the big guns with @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 all on the schedule			0
@entity72 is also on the bill with his second collection for @entity75 and is expected to enjoy a celebrity - studded front row , with @entity77 and @entity78 among the names likely to turn out to support the young designer			0
composed : @entity34 's restrained cobalt , white and grey palette helped her collection hang together neatly elegant : full skirts , neatly cropped trousers and beautifully tailored jackets were highlights of @entity34 's offering come the weekend , all eyes will be on @entity7 as the fashion world 's heavyweights take to the runway , beginning with @entity95 presenting his third collection for @entity97			1
also on the schedule is @entity99 , whose debut collection for @entity102 will appear in just over a month 's time , and @entity104 , fresh from a typically controversial showing at @entity106			0
other names showing in the @entity7 capital over the weekend include @entity109 , @entity39 , edgy fashion favourite @entity110 and the ever - popular @entity112			1
if that was n't enough , there 's also @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 to enjoy before @entity119 kicks off next week with a show on monday morning			1
fashion tv : @entity46 actor @entity45 takes to the catwalk alongside @entity124 designer @entity123 colourful : designs in bold turquoise and crimson appeared during the show along with plenty of jewels expected : former @entity30 @entity133 editor @entity132 @entity97 fan : @entity135 turned out last season ever present : @entity138 @entity133 's @entity137 following hot on her heels comes @entity140 at @entity141 before tuesday morning brings what many consider the highlight of @entity146 - @entity145 's biannual extravaganza at @entity147			1
@entity145 is followed onto the catwalk by @entity149 and @entity150 for @entity151 , who is expected to stage an intimate presentation rather than a full blown show according to @entity133			2
@entity7 gets a fitting farewell on wednesday with a grand finale courtesy of a @entity157 spectacular at @entity158 and the quirky girlishness of @entity161 's @entity160			1
but if the thought of waving goodbye to the fashion @entity164 leaves you feeling unfashionably blue , then bear this in mind : it 's just three months until cruise appears			0
spectacular : @entity145 proves his worth yet again during @entity7 couture earlier this year a tale of two cities : the @entity176 's catwalks draw big names of their own but @entity7 is a magnet for @entity181 stars			0

the fashion extravaganza kicked off with new star @entity15
she showed a composed collection in cobalt blue , white and grey
