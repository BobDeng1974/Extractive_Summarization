a young @entity1 woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning @entity3 to remove ' body shaming ' emoticons and status options from the social media site			1
@entity10 , along with seven other women around the world , has partnered with @entity11 , an international movement challenging body image standards , to launch a campaign to remove the ‘ i feel fat ’ and ‘ i feel ugly ’ emoticons from the social media site			1
ms @entity10 , a counsellor and intern psychologist , is one of over ten thousand people to back the ' fat is not a feeling ' petition , and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming , especially in young people			1
@entity11 has been petitioning @entity3 to remove the options from their site , and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website			2
women from the @entity50 , @entity51 , the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign , which has garnered thousands of signatures in just a few days			1
@entity3 has long held itself up as a community driven social media site , and over the ten years since it 's inception , has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site			2
the ' fat ' and ' ugly ' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the ' feelings ' feature for status updates , along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user 's mood			2
ms @entity10 said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves			1
' encouraging this kind of ' fat talk ' is not okay – and that ’s exactly what @entity3 is doing by offering these words as options , ' ms @entity10 said			1
eight women have partnered with endangered bodies , a movement challenging body image standards the eight women have all started national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website psychologist @entity96 from @entity57 , along with her colleagues from around the world , have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response			1
' @entity3 has not been listening			0
not only do these features remain as emoji selections , @entity3 have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming , ' ms @entity96 said			1
' this is despite the fact @entity3 claims that one of their core values is to build social value - which in this instance they are not doing			2
this is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that @entity3 use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders , weight concern and anxiety , ' she said			0
' " feeling fat " was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society			0
it is well documented that " fat talk " , as using such terms is known , perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it			0
women from the @entity50 , @entity51 , the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 are campaigners @entity11 has been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced over 10,000 people have signed the ' fat is not a feeling ' petition on @entity140 ms @entity10 said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues , and that it is a concern for @entity1			1
the petition explains that ' ‘ fat ’ and ‘ ugly ’ are adjectives			2
they describe physical characteristics , not feelings			0
' ' having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings			0
what ’s worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women ( and increasingly men ) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies , ' the petition says			2
' when someone says “ i feel fat ” what they ’re really communicating is that they feel unattractive , unhappy , embarrassed and insecure about their body			0
and believe it or not , these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic , culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day			0
' ms @entity10 , who works as a counsellor at @entity180 , @entity57 's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems , said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look			1
' for young people , who are on @entity3 from nine , ten , 11 years of age , having a huge platform like this tell them it 's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue			1
' ' @entity3 encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look , so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world			2
doing this really places an extreme focus on the external , instead of the internal , ' she said			0
the ' fat ' and ' ugly ' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the ' feelings ' feature for status updates ms @entity10 said that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues the petition explains that ' ‘ fat ’ and ‘ ugly ’ are adjectives			1
they describe physical characteristics , not feelings ' ' we begin to measure our worth by the way that we look – because let ’s face it , @entity3 is n’t the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great , wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside			0
' ms @entity10 said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed			1
' there are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look , and why we feel bad about ourselves , ' she said			0
' there are cues everywhere around us , guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice , then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light			0
' to sign the petition please visit the @entity140 website , and to view the work that @entity11 does around the world , please visit their website			0
