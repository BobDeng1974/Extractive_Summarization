by @entity0 published : 20:15 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 5 september 2013 as two of the world 's most celebrated photographers , @entity2 and @entity5 have each had their fair share of challenging scenarios			1
but a new project for @entity9 presented one that neither had encountered before			0
working with a smartphone - namely the new @entity12 - instead of their usual cameras			2
in a glimpse from behind the scenes on the shoot in @entity17 , @entity18 , earlier this summer , mr @entity2 is seen using the new handset to capture mr @entity5 with two of the borough 's locals			1
legends on location : @entity2 is seen taking a snap of fellow photographer @entity5 with two @entity17 locals using a smartphone during their first shoot together on july 18 by all accounts , the pair had a blast working with one another - despite the fact that it turned out to be one of the hottest days of the year			1
not that the heat even caused mr @entity5 , 75 , to break a sweat , he told @entity37 in an interview afterwards			1
' there was this bunch of kids who opened up the fire hydrant - and guess who was in it with all the kids ? @entity5 ! ' dismissing our concern over the searing temperatures , he said : ' i 've been in hotter places			2
@entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 - everywhere ! ' it was memorable spending the day in @entity17 with @entity2 showing me around			2
' indeed , for mr @entity2 , 67 , revisiting @entity17 was a trip down memory lane			1
' i 've always loved it , it 's always been my favorite place in @entity18			0
' i 've just always enjoyed the people up there , the way they dress			0
i 've gone to church up there a couple of times			0
i always have an amazing time			0
' and those summer temperatures , he added , were actually more help than hindrance when it came to capturing the locals			0
longtime friends : @entity2 at the @entity76 in february ( left ) and @entity5 in @entity77 in may last year ( right ) ' i think the heat really brought a lot of people out , you know , in a different way , ' he said			1
' some people were in bathing suits , some people were in big hats - it 's kinda crazy ! the other side of the camera : @entity2 pictured in 2005 ahead of the release of his book @entity92 ' we were on the way to this boxing gym and there was this bunch of kids who opened up the fire hydrant - and guess who was in it with all the kids ? @entity5			1
he was soaking wet , you know			0
i got soaking wet too ! we were n't so worried about the cameras ! ' not that mr @entity5 would have even worried much with his usual kit			1
' the camera i use is pretty waterproof anyway - it should be for what it cost , ' he added			0
using a smartphone to take pictures was not a foreign concept for mr @entity5 , who says that ' if it takes a picture , i 'm going to use it			2
' it was a first for mr @entity2 though , who has never even shot in digital before			2
both failed to be enticed by the terminology and apps that dominate smartphone photography these days though			0
neither was familiar with the term ' selfie ' , and while mr @entity2 is familiar with @entity125 , he is not tempted to use it himself			2
' i do n't know if i like the idea of sharing with a lot of people , you know , not that i 'm doing so many interesting things , but it seems weird to me , ' he says			0
' i do n't have anything against it , you know , if people like what they do - others in the studio do a lot of instagram and take beautiful pictures - and sometimes they take pictures of themselves - it 's kind of funny , i like to see how they see themselves			0
' in @entity148 : mr @entity5 pictured in 1965 , not long after he shot to fame , in his studio on @entity151 both photographers , who have ' been mates for years and years ' , admitted they were impressed by the capabilities of the 41 megapixel smartphone , which claims to simplify the controls previously reserved for professionals			1
high tech : both photographers were impressed by the 41 megapixel smartphone , which simplifies controls previously reserved for professionals ' this is the first time that i have used a mobile phone for my work , said mr @entity2 , who shot in colour , despite the fact that black - and - white imagery has defined his career			1
' @entity9 has created a smartphone which not only matches the capabilities of many high - end cameras , but in most cases surpasses them			0
' mr @entity5 , who shot to fame in the @entity175 , shooting the world 's most famous models for @entity148 and will be celebrated by the @entity178 next summer in a major exhibition titled @entity180 , was equally impressed			1
' the level of detail you can capture using a @entity12 is nothing short of breathtaking , ' he added			2
between them , mr @entity2 and mr @entity5 took over 1,000 photographs , 30 of which will be displayed in @entity77 between 13 and 21 september at the @entity188 in @entity189			1
more images from the shoot will feature in exhibitions set to take place in different destinations across the globe at later dates this year			0
the first exhibition from @entity5 and @entity2 's @entity17 shoot will take place in @entity77 at the @entity188 in @entity189 between 13 - 21 september			1
