by @entity0 published : 08:35 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 08:46 est , 24 october 2012 it wo n't do much for its rock n roll image but music giant @entity3 has decided to ban its staff from showing their tattoos and male workers having long hair			1
the high street retailer 's new ' appearance policy ' also outlaws footwear like flip flops as they try to impose rules to make workers look more professional			1
@entity3 want to move away from the scruffy stereotype of record shop workers , so only ' discreet ' body art or piercings can be on show from next friday			1
' if someone does have extensive body art - whether in store or at head office , we would expect them to cover this up whilst working , ' a company spokesman said			1
changes : @entity3 staff will have to cover tattoos up and men will have to cut their hair under new rules ' more discreet tattoos and piercings are not an issue so long as people look smart			1
it goes without saying that we want our work colleagues to feel valued as individuals who can express their personalities , but it 's also important that we balance this against the needs and expectations of our customers , who , ultimately , have to be at the heart of everything we do			2
' we 'd like to think our colleagues are presentable anyway , so this is just about adopting a more consistent approach , which we believe our customers will appreciate			0
' however , this new image has not been conveyed on its website yet , where a member of staff is shown with lots of tattoos and a large piercing in their face			0
police recruits to @entity63 's largest police force - the @entity64 - were banned last month from having visible tattoos in a sweeping reform of its public image			1
got to go : any large tattoos like these ones would have to be covered up if someone worked for @entity3 @entity73 commissioner @entity72 said body art that can be seen by the public ' damages the professional image ' of the service			0
and he ordered a ' tattoo amnesty ' in which anyone who already has marks on their hands , neck or face must declare them within weeks or be sacked			0
the ban comes amid increasing concern among senior ranks nationwide over complaints from crime victims that some young officers appear ' thuggish '			0
they are particularly worried about the trend for tattoo ' sleeves ' in which wrap - around tattoos are inked along the arm			2
but rank - and - file representatives claim associating tattoos with criminals is old - fashioned and police should reflect the public they serve			2
@entity3 's decision is likely to be driven by its poor financial performance in recent years			0
last month @entity3 â€™s new boss @entity104 spoke as the music and movie retailer posted another dismal trading update , wiping eight per cent off the value of its shares			2
the chief executive , who joined from camera retailer @entity113 , blamed an uninspiring stable of releases for a disappointing 11.6 per cent decline in underlying sales for the 20 weeks to september 15 .			0
