@entity3 is on course to reject independence , the leader of the campaign to save the @entity2 has confidently predicted			1
better together leader @entity6 insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead , but he suggested half a million people in @entity3 have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck			1
first minister @entity14 claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were ' only deferred ‘ yes ’ - es ' , as he faced claims he was embarking on a ' premature victory lap ' with four days until the historic referendum			1
‘ we will win and i know that because i have seen the returns			1
be in no doubt about it , ’ he said			0
‘ our returns are good			2
our vote is holding up and we are actually doing very well			0
he suggested that some voters will go to the ballot box still ‘ swithering in their own mind ’ about which way to vote and candidly admitted : ‘ the situation is quite fluid ’			1
more than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307 - year - old @entity2			0
experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent			0
but speaking in @entity50 yesterday , mr @entity6 told journalists there are half a million people who have yet to settle on their decision			0
he said : ' we have been contacting tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks and our best estimate is of about 500,000 people we think are still to make their minds up			0
‘ you do get people at this late stage where people are going from yes to no to yes and back again			0
‘ the situation is quite fluid			1
there will be a lot of people who my guess is when they go into the polling station may be swithering in their own mind			2
‘ people maybe in the space of a day might change their mind			2
i do believe the silent majority in @entity3 does not want to take on the risks of independence			2
’ the latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results , but suggest the result is too close to call			1
a @entity85 survey for @entity86 put no on 50.6 per cent and yes 49.4 per cent			0
a poll by @entity88 gave the no campaign an eight - point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an @entity92 survey in @entity93 put @entity94 on 53 per cent and yes 47 per cent			2
however , a surprise @entity96 poll for the @entity98 put the @entity100 campaign eight points ahead , on 54 per cent , although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people			2
the opponents appeared on the @entity107 @entity106 show to discuss thursday 's vote			2
@entity109 leader @entity14 looked jovial as he attempted to play the violin confident : chairman of the @entity113 campaign , @entity6 , said he was certain @entity3 would vote against independence after reviewing internal research when asked about the number of voters yet to choose a side , of which there are an estimated 500,000 , @entity14 referred to them as ' deferred yes - es '			1
he joined @entity3 singer @entity123 ( right ) and bands @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 at @entity50 's @entity128 today ' @entity130 victory lap ' : with just four days until the historic vote , the first minister of @entity3 said he was already certain voters would sway towards independence and is celebrating in advance @entity123 signed @entity136 with the @entity109 leader today in @entity50 at a pro-independence rally but he warned that the result would be decisive			1
‘ if we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back			0
we will have bought a one way ticket with no return			0
this is not something we can try out			0
’ he said that with five days to go until the vote , there were still five questions about jobs , currency , pensions , prices and funding public services which mr @entity14 has failed to answer			1
in an interview on @entity158 ’s @entity106 show today , he accused mr @entity14 of doing a “ premature victory lap ” ahead of the polling day			1
“ we still do n’t know how we can ensure that we do n’t lose jobs , with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of @entity3 – that would be a disaster for @entity3			0
‘ we still do n’t know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the @entity165			0
‘ we do n’t know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking @entity14 a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted			1
‘ but he was just simply asserting that low and behold on friday morning , everybody else is wrong , they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say			0
’ planning ahead : the first minister let slip he was planning to attend the @entity178 if the vote for independence is secured on thursday with conflicting polling results being published with just four days to go and an estimated half - a - million voters still undecided , mr @entity6 ( right ) said the situation was ' fluid '			1
experts have said the race is too close to call at this point the opposing campaign leaders shook hands this morning after an appearance on the @entity106 show the latest poll of polls , compiled by political expert professor @entity193 at @entity194 , puts the no campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent			1
it follows four new polls overnight , with only an @entity96 survey for the @entity98 giving the @entity100 campaign a lead , which based based on a smaller - than - normal sample of only 700 people as the battle over independence hots , last night saw a spectacular fireworks display and @entity206 carrying flaming torches to mark the 50th anniversary of the @entity209 hundreds of festival goers showed their support for the @entity2 next to the @entity212 in @entity213 where the @entity215 festival was held on saturday mr @entity14 insisted if @entity217 votes for independence , it will be a ' day of celebration ' mr @entity14 today let slip that he is planning a visit to watch the @entity178 golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300 - year - old @entity2			1
the @entity3 first minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence , he will travel to @entity226 to watch the likes of @entity228 and @entity229 teeing off			1
mr @entity14 's wife @entity230 has reportedly encouraged him to play golf during the independence campaign to help clear his head after dire warnings that @entity100 vote could trigger economic catastrophe , no campaigners accused mr @entity14 of embarking on a ' premature victory lap ' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice			1
but he also insisted that there will be ' urgent business following a yes victory on friday ' , adding : ' firstly i think it will be a day of celebration , @entity3 will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics			1
' but there 's a lot of business to do			0
and the first and urgent business is to bring @entity3 together			0
' because on friday , after a @entity100 vote there 'll cease to be a @entity100 campaign and a no campaign			2
there 'll be a @entity217			0
and i 've said very clearly that i want into that @entity217 as many voices as possible , people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together			0
' he went on : ' one of the great assets of the @entity100 campaign is we do n’t regard any section or sector of @entity3 society or any geography of @entity3 beyond our reach			2
' we tend to take the attitude that there is n’t so much a ‘ no ’ vote in @entity3			0
there are only deferred ‘ yes ’ - es. and that ’s been one of the successes of our campaign … ' he vowed that that if he loses thursday 's vote , he will not try to force another referendum			2
' if you remember previous constitutional referenda in @entity3 , there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997			0
' that 's what i mean by a political generation … this is a once in a generation , perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for @entity3			0
' mr @entity14 's wife @entity296 is reportedly credited with encouraging the first minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to ' unwind and clear his head ' , according to the @entity86			1
it also emerged that mr @entity14 was playing against the 14 - year - old son of the greenkeeper at @entity305 golf course overlooking the @entity306 when news broke of an opinion poll putting the @entity100 campaign ahead last weekend .			1
