writer and broadcaster @entity0 says farewell to @entity3 on the day football ’s legends joined the @entity6 faithful in paying their respects to the former @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 superstar			1
history is suffused with irony			0
it will be noted by posterity that on a day when jubilation should have been coursing through the veins of every lover of @entity6 , they were in fact muting the trumpets and draping the halls with black rather than maroon			0
they came to honour a man who had n’t lived long enough to savour the triumphant emergence of his beloved club from near destitution			0
crowds clap whilst the hearse carrying the coffin of @entity3 leaves @entity34 for his funeral but the claiming of their new divisional title will now be a permanent reminder of the resilience that @entity3 bequeathed his club when he strode the turf with a broad - chested imperiousness that was the formidable bridgehead for @entity11 ’ triumphs in the 1950s			1
as they laid him to rest on tuesday you could n’t help but think that nature had played a cruel trick in ending his life only several weeks before the confirmation of the end of the struggle for credibility and self - esteem that his first club had been engaged in for so long			2
@entity3 must , though , have had an inkling of the course of events which was leading inevitably to that apotheosis			1
the crowds who thronged the streets as the cortege made its way from @entity6 itself for a remembrance service at @entity68 , and who threw their scarves at the procession as if to add sustenance to his last journey , must have believed that even in the later stages of his life he will have been mentally kicking every ball for his former club such was his lasting affection for the @entity78			0
the hearse carrying @entity3 's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing i was a student when i first saw the triumphant @entity11 side of 1957 - 8 which he captained , when they not only won the title but created a @entity90 goal - scoring record of 132 scored and only 29 against			1
i do n’t know particularly why but i do instantly recall a game they played against @entity93 at the old @entity94 where you could be very close to the pitch and , to this day , i will always associate @entity3 with ‘ glaur			1
’ for there he was yomping his way through the mud like a primeval predator whilst , through his prompting , @entity11 were playing the kind of slick football that as @entity106 boy i thought was simply the preserve of the @entity107			1
and i can not eliminate the image of his sliding into a tackle that took both @entity3 and the @entity93 man off the pitch and almost into the dog - track fence which surrounded the playing area			1
he was n’t censured because the ball was what he was after and got			0
nor was he ever sent off in any game he ever played in from schools football through to the highest senior level , although his reputation for toughness did frankly make some opponents quiver when they saw his name posted on the team - sheet , as sir @entity125 alluded to , in paying his respects on tuesday			1
the cortege leaves @entity11 ' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects ‘ i was playing for @entity134 reserves against @entity11 reserves at @entity6 and the great @entity3 was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe , ’ said sir @entity125			1
‘ he tackled me and i thought : “ @entity138 ! ” but in those days you had to get up no matter what			0
so i got up and had a look at that big , barrel chest of his and he just said : “ are you all right , son ? ” that was a great memory - the only time i played against @entity3 - and i ’ll never forget it			1
’ nor , when he had gone south to @entity149 football , will any of us ever forget the iconic photograph of @entity3 lifting @entity151 off his feet with a clenched fist , like a boy he had caught picking his pocket			1
we look at it now with affection			0
i never saw malice in it			0
@entity3 hated the image , as he thought it showed him as a bully			2
to me , it was like portraying rough - and - ready fatherly instinct			0
his game never changed with @entity12 when , with the likes of the great ‘ @entity169 ’ @entity166 and @entity167 , he helped establish a regime at @entity171 with a proud @entity173 accent which made that ground a fortress and a team feared throughout @entity177			2
in that setting it was no surprise that they won the ‘ @entity183 ’ in 1960 - 61 , the fa cup in succeeding years and the @entity182 in 1963			0
they loved his commitment , his ability to help pull his team back from occasional adversity			0
the order of service for @entity3 's funeral that is why so many notables from the @entity149 game travelled to @entity195 yesterday to pay tribute alongside the @entity11 faithful			1
his @entity12 former colleagues were there			2
@entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity167 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , who told the congregation : ‘ whenever i hear the bagpipes playing * flower of @entity208 * i think of @entity3 - a proud @entity209 who never forgot his roots			1
’ @entity167 added : ‘ the legacy he leaves is unbelievable for three clubs - @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
he was a fantastic , inspirational guy			0
no mountain was too high for @entity3 to climb			2
’ tuesday ’s cross-border representation reflected the fact that they recognised him as one of the best - ever @entity173 exports to the @entity149 game			2
for some reason we did not see the best of him in a @entity173 jersey and he did not talk much about being in the side which was devastated 9 - 3 by @entity149 at @entity224 in 1961			0
within sir @entity125 ’s comments , though , there was also an element of regret about @entity3 ’s record in the sense that he was under - appreciated in certain quarters , pointing to the paucity of caps he earned			1
‘ only 22 caps for a player as good as that ? ’ he lamented			1
‘ @entity208 was picked by a committee with its head in the sand			2
if @entity241 had been manager , he ’d have 50 odd caps			2
‘ everyone talks about his courage and his bravery , but he was a fantastic footballer			0
he was skilful , he could play anywhere and he proved that			0
i think we ’ve seen the passing of a great legend			0
’ from the master there can be no more fitting epitaph .			0

@entity3 's funeral was held in @entity195 on tuesday
former @entity12 and @entity11 *midfielder* died earlier this month aged *80*
sir @entity125 *questioned* why @entity3 only managed to earn 22 caps for @entity208
