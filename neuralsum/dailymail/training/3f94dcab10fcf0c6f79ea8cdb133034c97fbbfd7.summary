the only way is skinny : the perpetually slimming @entity2 girls @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 bestelling @entity7 diet , which makes a number of bizarre claims as to how to shed the pounds the claim the book ’s title is inspired by the stars of @entity2 and their obsession with competitive dieting			1
author @entity16 urges readers to ‘ be skinnier than all your friends ’			1
the science a @entity21 study of 2,000 women aged 18 to 45 found that 54 per cent said the first thing they noticed about another woman was her weight – and they then compared themselves with her			1
so playing on this competitive aspect is clever of @entity30			2
a @entity32 study in 2011 said our food choices are affected by our friends and if we hang out with ‘ skinny ’ women , we are more likely to be slim too			2
@entity37 says ‘ six weeks to @entity7 is a catchy slogan that attracts the @entity40 generation , ’ says @entity41 , cognitive behavioural therapist at @entity43			1
‘ the quirky advice has a novelty factor and the six weeks angle appeals to our love of a quick fix			1
the competition of “ @entity53 than all your friends ” can be motivating but i ’d hate to think the book encourages girls to focus on being skinny rather than healthy			1
’ verdict ditch it the claim ‘ no carbs before @entity58 , ’ as they say in @entity2			1
@entity16 claims that if you want to be slim , you must aim for no more than 120 grams of carbohydrate a day			1
it makes no difference if you get all of your carbs from cans of coke or plates of broccoli , says the book			1
the science despite the sensational comparison of broccoli to @entity74 , @entity16 is not saying broccoli is bad – just that we need to limit our carbohydrate intake and make every meal half - protein if we want to stay slim			1
a 2008 study involving more than 1,000 overweight adults found those on high protein and low glycaemic index ( slow - burning carbs ) diets had more successful maintenance of weight loss than those on low - fat , low - calorie diets			1
another study in @entity91 showed an increase in protein resulted in rapid loss of weight and body fat			2
@entity107 ‘ people handle carbs differently			2
@entity102 dieters will store carbs as fat more readily than someone who does n’t diet , ’ says dr @entity96 , obesity specialist at @entity98			1
‘ but i would always encourage people to eat plenty of vegetables			2
’ verdict ditch it the @entity111 is good for its fibre and nutrients but it also contains fructose , which stops leptin from switching off your appetite , so you wo n’t feel full after you ’ve eaten it			1
smoothies and juices are dangerous , says @entity16 , because you can drink more fructose than you can eat , which means calories go unnoticed			1
the science a review in 2011 said liquid carbohydrates fill you up less than solids and that there is likely to be an increase in total long - term energy intake			2
on the most basic level , a smoothie is n’t going to fill you up			0
@entity107 ‘ i ’ve seen patients who ca n’t understand their obesity because they eat healthily			0
then it turns out they are eating too much fruit or drinking fruit smoothies , downing 300 calories in a couple of minutes , ’ says dr le @entity96			0
‘ some smoothies have more calories than a @entity145 ’s milkshake			0
fruit is great , but if you are trying to lose weight , limit yourself to one piece a day			0
’ verdict do it the claim two cups of black coffee boosts the nervous system and when you have it on an empty stomach , it tells your body to burn fat faster			0
the effects last for four to five hours , according to @entity16			1
the science studies show that caffeine speeds up the metabolism by ten per cent			1
it increases the heart rate and the flow of blood			0
a 2011 study concluded that coffee assists fat loss			0
as soon as coffee is digested , it stimulates the release of fats into the blood , which then become the body ’s primary energy source before it reverts to using its limited stores of carbohydrate for fuel			0
@entity107 ‘ two cups of coffee will increase your basal metabolic rate by five to ten per cent for two hours , ’ says dr @entity179 , senior lecturer in nutrition at the @entity181			0
‘ the mechanism is n’t clear but caffeine is a stimulant so perhaps it increases nervous activity , making the body move more			0
new studies show it helps the body use carbohydrates more effectively			2
@entity194 also reduces our feeling of pain and effort so it can boost performance if you drink before exercise			0
’ verdict do it breakfast : not the day 's most important meal , experts say the @entity205 is n’t the most important meal of the day , says @entity16 , who argues that if you skip it and do early - morning exercise on an empty tummy , you ’ll kickstart the body into burning fat			1
the science studies into intermittent fasting show it can help you lose weight , burn fat , stabilise bloodsugar , and reduce blood - pressure and cholesterol			2
skipping breakfast is one way			1
other approaches include fasting on alternate days , or very low - calorie diets two days a week			0
but other research connects skipping breakfast with obesity and low concentration and anyone with diabetes or low blood - sugar should ask a doctor first			1
@entity107 ‘ we ’ve been brought up to think breakfast is the most important meal of the day , but research is challenging this , ’ says dr le @entity96			2
‘ exercising on an empty stomach is not going to make you feel unwell and you will burn fat			0
some are naturally not hungry in the morning but eat breakfast anyway , consuming 500 calories for no reason			2
’ verdict do it snacking : a big no no the @entity244 than ‘ grazing ’ , @entity16 says eating three meals a day – lunch , mid-afternoon and early evening – controls your appetite as it releases leptin ( a chemical that tells our brain we ’re full )			1
having longer gaps between meals encourages the body to burn fat			0
the science a study in the @entity32 found that those who ate three low - calorie , high - protein meals daily felt more satisfied and less hungry			2
@entity107 ‘ three quality , home - cooked meals a day is the best way to eat , ’ says @entity263 , professor of metabolic medicine at the @entity265			0
‘ on a more practical level , people who graze tend to eat bad foods ( crisps , snacks )			0
it could be that grazing food through the day means your brain never gets the signals that say you are full , as @entity16 says , but so many chemical reactions occur when we eat food , it ’s hard to be certain			1
’ verdict do it the claim taking a cool bath between @entity284 and @entity285 every morning encourages your body to burn stored fat as it tries to keep warm			0
it will boost metabolism for up to 15 hours , says @entity16 , as cold activates ‘ good ’ brown fat , burning calories to keep warm			1
the science some scientists think brown fat is the magic key to weight loss			0
a @entity297 study chilled a group of men and found their metabolic rates increased by 80 per cent			2
the brown fat burned 250 calories in three hours			0
obesity has even been linked to central heating			0
@entity107 ‘ sitting in an icecold bath will burn extra calories and raise metabolism , but i ’m not sure how long the effect would last , ’ says @entity304 , professor of endocrinology at the @entity306			0
‘ you might just be subjecting your body to a massive insult every morning			0

the @entity7 diet is a *global* *phenomenon* . the book that *promises* to help you drop 20 lb in just six weeks has *outsold* the @entity318 . *written* by *personal* *trainer* @entity319 ( under the *pen* name @entity16 ) and inspired by *tv* show @entity2 , six weeks to @entity7 : @entity322 has been dismissed by many doctors as *gimmicky* at best , and dangerous at worst . the advice , which includes skipping breakfast and going easy on the broccoli , might be bizarre , but it has sold *120,000* *copies* . most bizarre of all , it has some scientific basis . @entity330 and @entity331 spoke to experts and found what to do and what to ditch .
