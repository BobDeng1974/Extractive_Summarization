the black dot on his nose and his white - socked paws do not single out @entity4 as a particularly remarkable cat			1
so it must be his charm that has led this moggy into the centre of a bitter tug - of - love which ended in a courtroom drama and left one family £ 20,000 worse off			2
the extraordinary row , which has set two lifetime animal lovers against each other , began last year when @entity16 handed over @entity4 to june @entity17 on what she thought was a temporary basis			1
@entity4 : new owner june @entity17 called the nine - year - old cat ' my best friend ' but mrs @entity23 , 83 , has refused to hand the cat back and , in a controversial ruling , the judge found in her favour – leaving the pet ’s original owners devastated			1
the questions over custody of the cat began in june last year when mrs @entity16 asked her vet for help to find @entity4 a friendly family to live with while builders renovated their house			1
mrs @entity16 and her husband @entity38 , a director of advertising agency @entity39 , were finally ready to transform their property close to @entity43 , @entity44 , into their dream home			2
this involved gutting the house			2
the @entity50 and their two children @entity51 and @entity53 had to move to a rented flat nearby and their landlord had said that nine - year - old @entity4 was not welcome			1
mrs @entity16 says she made it clear from the outset she was only looking for someone to foster her pet			2
but she was forced to resort to the courts after attempts by mediators to persuade mrs @entity23 to give @entity4 back – including a visit by the police in december last year – failed			1
however , elderly mrs @entity23 , of @entity64 , @entity44 , who has taken in more than 30 cats over a lifetime of animal welfare , maintains she would never have accepted @entity4 on a temporary basis			1
she says that for her , a cat is for life			0
the confusion led to court and a hearing to decide custody of @entity4 was held at @entity76 on december 13			2
district judge @entity77 dismissed mrs @entity16 ’s civil claim ‘ for the return of her personal chattel ( cat named @entity4 ) ’ but did not explain his reasons			1
upset : @entity16 , seen left with son @entity51 and daughter @entity53 , insists she made it clear from the outset she only wanted somebody to foster her pet , but june @entity17 , right is adamant she is @entity4 's rightful owner mrs @entity16 was ordered to pay mrs @entity23 ’s legal costs and her own , which together total £ 20,000			1
she has been ordered to pay £ 10,500 by january 10			0
mrs @entity16 , 50 , said : ‘ we are all absolutely distraught			1
i have been crying and the children are very upset			0
@entity4 was such a lively member of our family			2
he brought us so much joy			0
’ she added : ‘ i did everything i could do to reason with mrs @entity23 but she would n’t listen			1
i asked the @entity94 for advice and i even called the police to get my cat back but they told me there was nothing they could do			1
‘ my solicitor said the only way was to go to court			0
he was certain we would win			0
but – despite all the evidence that @entity4 is ours – the judge ruled in her favour			1
' there is no justice			0
and now not only do we not have @entity4 but i have a £ 20,000 legal bill , half of which i must pay in the next 28 days			2
i do n’t have that kind of money – it ’s @entity114			0
’ ' now not only do we not have @entity4 but i have a £ 20,000 legal bill ' original owner @entity16 but widow mrs @entity23 is adamant that she is @entity4 ’s rightful owner			1
the retired switchboard operator told the @entity118 : ‘ i wanted to be a vet when i was a girl but i could n’t because of the war			0
‘ but i have always taken in animals who need a home			0
i never would have agreed to “ foster ” anyone ’s cat			0
‘ i could not believe it when she sent the policemen after me			0
’ mrs @entity23 , who has chronic asthma and arthritis , added : ‘ he is very happy here			1
he follows me around everywhere i go and he puts his paws around my neck when we have a cuddle			0
‘ he is a great companion			0
he gives me a reason to get up and go to the shops			0
he is my best friend			0
‘ and at the end of the day the judge decided that @entity4 is mine			2
’ as for @entity4 , he simply divides his time between sitting on top of the fridge , rolling around in front of the electric fire and sitting on mrs @entity23 ’s lap when she watches tv .			1

@entity16 handed @entity4 over to june @entity17 on what she thought was a temporary basis while her house was being renovated
but mrs @entity23 , 83 , has refused to hand the cat back and a judge has ruled in her favour - leaving the @entity50 distraught
