but , just like @entity72 's character land baron @entity70 in the film @entity69 , officials are concerned that a new buyer will over-develop the unspoiled land			2
mr @entity22 said in a statement that selling @entity5 was not an impulsive decision , but he has been looking for a buyer who would have the right enthusiasm , commitment and respect for the island 's residents			1
he said : ' i have learned in life that change is inevitable and can be quite positive when guided in the right direction			0

' unspoiled : the area is relatively untouched , compared to other areas in @entity14 , with only 30 miles of paved roads on the 141 square - mile island @entity104 terrain : the only major developments on the island , which was formerly famous for its pineapples , have been two four season 's hotels and two golf courses protected : just like @entity72 's character in @entity69 , the mayor of the island is concerned new buyers will over-develop the area with a reported price tag of £ 600million , @entity5 did not come cheap			1
but the undisclosed final amount is a relative drop in the crystal clear ocean for new owner @entity2 , whose net worth is estimated at £ 36billion , according to @entity122			2
the 67 - year - old is sixth on @entity122 ' list of global billionaires , but four below @entity61 giant @entity6 who was rumoured to have been in the running to buy the 141 sq mile inlay , where he married wife @entity20 in 1994			0

he has a keen property portfolio , which includes a @entity146 estate worth an estimated $ 110m and more than 12 properties in @entity148			0
the entertainment system in one of his houses is also rumoured to have cost $ 1million and includes a rock concert - sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool			0
the deal involves 88,000 acres of land , plus two resorts , two golf courses , a stable and various residential and commercial buildings , lawyers for @entity22 told the utilities commission in its application			1

@entity5 is known as @entity5 as in 1922 , @entity178 , the president of the @entity179 , bought the land and turned it into the world 's largest plantation of the fruit			1
however , mr @entity22 halted the heritage industry on the island when he acquired the fruit and vegetable company ( and turned it into the world 's largest producer in the process )			1
but he was more modest in the development of @entity5 's big - scale tourism industry , approving only two major luxury @entity194 's resorts and two golf courses			2
however , as the island is already a popular tourist destination , with 26,000 people already visiting the island this year , according to the @entity200 , @entity2 may want to take advantage of the money - making potential of the area .			0
