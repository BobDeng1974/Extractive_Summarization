by @entity0 a @entity3 girls ’ state school which recruits only female staff has been criticised by @entity6 inspectors for a lack of male influence on pupils			1
@entity10 in @entity11 has been told to introduce male role models to its ‘ all - female environment ’			1
the 664 - pupil school was visited by inspectors last month as @entity6 ’s ‘ @entity20 ’ probe into attempts to impose a strict religious agenda on schools was extended beyond @entity19			1
the watchdog found that music was not taught as a separate subject to 11 to 14 - year - olds and some teachers were given performance targets to develop the school ’s ‘ @entity28 ethos ’			2
inspectors also reported that the school operated an ‘ all - female learning environment ’ which extended to male governors ‘ not interact [ ing ] with students ’			1
@entity10 , in @entity11 , was visited by inspectors last month as @entity6 's ' @entity20 ' probe into attempts to impose a strict religious agenda on schools was extended beyond @entity19 @entity6 urged the school to ‘ increase opportunities for the broadest range of positive role models , including men and male governors , to be part of students ’ learning ’			1
the college was also told to ‘ continue to review the breadth and balance of the curriculum ’ , although it currently met legal requirements			0
the school ’s recruitment policies are already being investigated by the @entity54 amid concerns they may be unlawful			2
@entity54 officials intervened earlier this year after the school ran job adverts specifying women teaching staff			2
now the department ’s @entity61 ( @entity61 ) says it is ‘ working with ’ the college to ensure recruitment procedures are ‘ fully compliant ’ with equality law			0
@entity66 – motto ‘ @entity74 ’ – aims to educate girls aged 11 to 18 ‘ in the context of the @entity71 faith as a way of life ’			0
the designated faith school was judged ‘ outstanding ’ at its last full @entity6 inspection and is regularly among the highest - performing state comprehensives in the country			1
@entity6 placed five schools in @entity19 special measures earlier this month after investigating allegations of a concerted attempt to introduce a strict @entity28 agenda in state schools			1
it uncovered an ’ organised campaign ’ to impose a ‘ narrow faith - based ideology ’ on schools which was resulting in pupils being poorly prepared for life in modern @entity89			0
education secretary @entity92 has ordered a report into the ' @entity20 ' scandal in @entity19 the watchdog made a snap inspection at @entity66 last month because the ‘ chief inspector was concerned about the effectiveness of safeguarding and leadership and management at the academy ’			1
in their report , inspectors praised many aspects of the school – which became an academy with extra freedoms in 2011 - and noted that students were ‘ prepared for life in modern @entity89 ’			2
the school is ‘ aware of the risk of extremism and radicalisation ’ and implements the government ’s ‘ @entity114 ’ strategy aimed at combating it , the report said			0
‘ an annual “ health check ” by the local counter-terrorism unit ensures the academy is following best practice , ’ it added			0
@entity6 said @entity10 was aware of the risk of extremism and implemented a strategy to help prevent it the report said music was not taught as a separate subject to younger pupils but noted that pupils were exposed to music in classes such as drama and allowed to stage performances			1
it added : ‘ some teachers ’ targets are linked to the development of the academy ’ s @entity28 ethos but these are in the minority ’			0
the report said governors ‘ express a range of different views on the rationale for the retention of an all - female learning environment ’			0
it added : ‘ male governors are not role models within the academy because they do not interact with students in this all - female environment			1
’ @entity6 warned that if the school ’s recruitment policy is found not to comply with @entity112 requirements , future @entity6 ratings for the head and governors could be affected			1
the school ’s two ‘ priorities for further improvement ’ were to increase pupils ’ exposure to male role models and ensure the curriculum ‘ continues to extend students ’ range of experience ’			1
defending its job adverts specifying women staff , the school ’s head , @entity169 , said earlier this year the policy had been accepted by the government when the school – previously a private school - entered the state education system			2
‘ @entity10 was established in 1984 for 11 to 18 - year - old @entity3 girls , in response to parental demand for single - sex education based on religious beliefs ’ she said			1
‘ when applying for voluntary - aided status in 2001 , it was made very clear to the @entity54 ( @entity184 as was ) and the @entity185 ( @entity186 ) that the school ’s intention was to continue to operate with female - only staff , based upon two legal opinions obtained at the time by the school			0
‘ this position was accepted by the @entity184 and @entity186 at the time			0
the school has recently taken further legal advice from a leading @entity196 , who has confirmed that the school ’s policy of a female - only teaching environment is not unlawful and complies with the terms of the @entity202			0
’ but @entity203 , of the @entity204 , claimed the school ’s actions were ‘ plainly unlawful ’			0
the outcome of the @entity54 investigation could have implications for other @entity3 faith schools employing single - sex staff			2
a @entity54 spokesman said : ‘ all schools must comply with equality law			0
‘ @entity215 is working with @entity10 to make sure their recruitment processes are fully compliant			0
