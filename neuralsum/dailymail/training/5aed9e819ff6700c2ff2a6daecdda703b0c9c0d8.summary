the chancellor dismissed the business secretary 's criticisms and told the @entity12 that while the property market is rebounding ‘ relatively quickly ’ in @entity15 , there is little evidence of rapid increases elsewhere			1
mr @entity2 insisted ministers should be reassuring voters that the coalition ’s reforms mean that the @entity22 has taken back responsibility to step in and deflate any unsustainable house price bubble			1
chancellor @entity2 , pictured in @entity25 today , has grown increasingly frustrated with outbursts from business secretary @entity3 senior @entity27 claim that the chancellor is prepared to see the housing market overheat in the run - up to the 2015 general election , boosting economic confidence and increasing the chances of a @entity34 election victory			1
but @entity36 sources told @entity37 that mr @entity2 dismissed mr @entity3 ’s warnings at yesterday ’s cabinet meeting			1
‘ in @entity15 prices are going up relatively rapidly but in many parts of the country that ’s simply not the case , ’ said one			1
‘ the @entity22 now has responsibility to look at house prices and intervene if it thinks it necessary			0
’ another source said : ‘ of course the government has to be vigilant about any kind of imbalance , not just in terms of housing			0
that ’s what we have reformed financial regulation in the way that we have			0
‘ @entity3 and others should be out there making a virtue of the fact that we are the government that has given the bank that power			2
’ tougher affordability checks are coming into force following a review of the mortgage market by the @entity70 regulator , the @entity69			0
this will mean banks and building societies being required to do new ‘ stress tests ’ on borrowers to ensure they will still be able to afford their loans if interest rates go up			0
mr @entity3 has spent the day at the @entity78 for @entity79 at the @entity80 figures show that house prices last month experienced their biggest monthly rise for more than four years			1
the average cost of a home rose by 8.4 per cent last year , according to the @entity87 building society			0
despite the rises , the average cost of a home , at £ 175,826 , is still five per cent below its pre-financial crisis peak in 2007			2
@entity6 house prices are set to rise by as much as a further eight per cent in 2014 , according to the most optimistic forecasts by economists and property professionals			2
last week mr @entity3 , the @entity27 business secretary , opened up another split in the coalition as he described house price increases as a ‘ worrying ’ development that could threaten the economy			1
‘ the government has done really good work turning the economy around : we ca n’t now risk it being derailed by a housing bubble repeating the mistakes of @entity8 , ’ mr @entity3 said			2
under mr @entity2 ’s changes to @entity109 ’s failed regulatory system , the @entity22 also has the power to rein in schemes such as @entity112 to buy and to demand that lenders limit mortgage borrowing			2
