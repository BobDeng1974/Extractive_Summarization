‘ when the call came to train , i thought it was one of the boys pulling my leg			2
then i was told i was starting and ever since then i have been trying to take in a lot of information in a short amount of time , get clued up on the systems and calls and everything			2
@entity2 coach @entity6 said he is not thinking about offering him a professional contract yet ‘ it has been a bit of a whirlwind and i ’ll try and do a bit of homework and get it all sorted for the match			1
‘ i know it is a real challenge to do well against @entity4 at the @entity69 but i have n’t even had time to work out who i am up against or to worry about them as i am just trying to get myself in the right frame of mind for the game			1
‘ it ’s going to be awesome			2
i have never even been to @entity76 before and to start against @entity4 is a great chance for me to see how i fare against the big boys			1
