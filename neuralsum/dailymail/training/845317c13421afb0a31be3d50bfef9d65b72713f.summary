whale watching is big business , with people travelling from all corners of the globe and shelling out $ 2.1billion in 2008 alone for the chance to head out to sea and hopefully get just a brief peek at these majestic creatures in their natural habitat			2
it would seem however that not all people are as excited by the chance to see a whale up close , as one man in @entity15 , @entity16 , was photographed by @entity17 as he sat in a sailboat on a recent outing glued to his phone screen			1
this as just a few feet a way a humpback whale rose to the surface right next to the boat			1
' he could have been texting his mom in the hospital for all i know , but i thought it sucked that he missed such a wonderful moment happening just two feet in front of him			0
' it was not just the one photo either , as @entity17 , who is a professional photographer , says he managed to get five snaps , and the man did not once stop looking at his phone			1
the man has yet to be identified , and it is not known what whale watching company @entity17 booked for his trip , which got him these amazing shots			2
@entity17 says the photo , which he posted wednesday , was taken a few weeks ago			0
humpbacks are one of the most impressive species of whale , migrating almost 20,000 miles a year and having been come back from the brink of extinction in the 1960s after their population declined by an astonishing 90 % as they became a popular target for the whaling industry			0
they have been a protected species since 1966 .			0

a photographer out on a whale watch captured the moment a humpback whale surfaced as a man sat on his sailboat *oblivious* to the sea *mammal*
the whale was just feet away from the man when the photo was taken in *january* , but all the man seemed to care about was his phone
the photographer , @entity17 , took five photos and in all of them the man was *staring* at his phone and never once looked at the humpback
