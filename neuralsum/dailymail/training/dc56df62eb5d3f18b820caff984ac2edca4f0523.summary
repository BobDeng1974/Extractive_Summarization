by @entity0 humans fear people , animals and objects approaching them , even if the person is not threatening , experts claim in our struggle to survive , humans have learned that something approaching us , such as a dangerous animal or a person , is more of a threat than one that is moving away from us			1
and while we do n’t have to worry too much about attacks by ferocious animals - in cities at least - this type of fear still plays a large part in our day - to - day lives			0
experts have found that humans still have negative feelings about people , animals and objects approaching them , even if the person is not threatening			1
‘ in order to survive , humans have developed a tendency to guard against animals , people and objects that come near them , ’ said @entity29 of the @entity30			1
‘ this is true for things that are physically coming closer , but also for events that are approaching in time or increasing in likelihood			0
’ in a study published in the @entity43 , professor @entity29 and students from @entity30 and the @entity45 , suggested that this fear , which they have called ‘ approach avoidance , ’ is an innate tendency			2
the scientists conducted eight tests to investigate their thesis and found that even nonthreatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer			1
even seemingly docile entities , such as deer , had a fear factor attached to them since participants could still attach some uncertainty to a wild animal 's behaviour			2
scary ? scientists conducted tests and found that even not threatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer			1
even seemingly docile entities , such as deer ( pictured ) had a fear factor attached to them since participants could still attach some uncertainty to a wild animal 's behaviour ‘ approach avoidance is a general tendency , humans do n't seem to adequately distinguish between times they should use it and when they should not , ’ professor @entity29 said			2
‘ they tend to fear approaching things and looming events even if objectively they need not fear			0
’ the scientists think their research has interesting implications and uses in a number of areas			0
marketing experts could use the information to determine if they should gradually move a product closer to viewers in a television commercial , or whether that could harm the image of the product , the scientists explained			0
similarly , speakers who tend to move closer and closer toward their audiences during their speeches should think twice , as doing so may cast an unfavourable impression on listeners , they said .			0

humans have an ' innate ' fear of people and animals moving towards them
study was conducted by @entity30
researchers conducted eight tests and found that even nonthreatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer
during tests , participants *reacted* negatively to a docile deer
findings could be used by *advertisers* and speakers , among others
