@entity1 judges dealt a hammer blow yesterday to @entity4 ’s attempts to crack down on the abuse of @entity7 ’s visa system			1
strict rules forcing foreign family members of @entity11 residents to get a permit before visiting the @entity7 were scrapped by the @entity13			1
this leaves @entity7 facing a fresh surge of @entity17 migrants if they are related to someone living in the @entity11 , and encourages people who want to exploit @entity7 ’s way of life entering the country			2
mr @entity4 has pledged to end abuse by so - called ‘ third country nationals ’ – those from outside the @entity11 who gain rights to live in the @entity7 by marrying non-british @entity11 citizens			2
ministers are concerned that sham marriages to @entity11 citizens accompanied by easy - to - obtain residence papers in some @entity11 countries would become another back door into @entity7			2
the ruling came in a case brought by @entity25 , a dual @entity7 and @entity26 national who lives and works in @entity27 , and his wife , a @entity30			1
they claimed her rights to freedom of movement were being infringed because she has to obtain a ‘ family permit ’ visa every time she wants to travel to the @entity7 even though she holds an @entity65 issued in @entity27 and both their children are @entity7			1
freedom of movement : the ruling is a blow to politicians ' promises for tighter migration controls thousands of jobs will be advertised in the @entity7 only after ministers agreed a new deal with @entity76			1
under current rules , any jobs posted on the government - run website @entity80 must also be placed on a @entity1 website , which helps would - be migrants search for work			0
@entity11 countries have now agreed to allow firms to advertise domestic vacancies only in their own country			0
the deal could encourage more companies to recruit locally because they would have to specifically opt - in if they wanted to advertise outside the @entity7			1
employment minister @entity92 said : ‘ the new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in @entity1 and put @entity7 residents first			1
we will continue to work to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses			0
’ the proposal still needs to be passed by the @entity102			0
ruling in the @entity104 ’ favour , the @entity13 said @entity7 was ‘ not permitted ’ to bar the spouse and children of an @entity11 citizen from entering the @entity7 without a visa			1
the government had introduced the rules because it was concerned that residence permits handed out by other @entity11 nations did not meet international security standards			2
the judges said @entity7 was able to assess documents at the border			0
the ruling only applies to the families of @entity11 residents who are living in the @entity11 outside their home nation			0
if , for instance , mrs @entity122 was married to a @entity27 man living in @entity27 , she would still need to apply for a visa			0
@entity127 mep @entity126 , the party ’s spokesman in @entity76 on justice and home affairs , criticised the judgment			1
‘ @entity7 will always be best placed to deal with its own immigration needs not a judge in @entity134 , ’ he said			1
@entity135 of @entity136 , chairman of @entity137 @entity7 , said : ‘ this is yet another @entity13 judgment which weakens our ability to control entry to the @entity7			0
this ruling trumps a @entity7 immigration control designed to prevent abuse			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 is disappointed			2
it is right to tackle the abuse of free movement rights			0

test case was brought by @entity152 @entity25 , who lives in @entity27
his @entity30 wife needs permit to visit @entity7 despite children being @entity7
@entity7 government had introduced the rules amid concerns over *lax* controls
@entity127 mep : ' @entity7 is best placed to deal with its needs , not a @entity166 judge '
