getting ready : @entity8 's attorney is shown putting a tie on the now - convicted killer during his trial @entity22 's claim that her 25 - year - old ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where @entity8 was found not guilty of battering her			1
prior to the commencement of that previous trial , the court ruled the phone call with the threat should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where @entity8 was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case			1
but @entity22 gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand during the eventual mistrial			2
the victim : three - month - old @entity14 died after being tossed from a moving car on a busy @entity1 highway ' the jurors heard testimony they should not have heard under any circumstances			1

i 'm not suggesting that any counsel did anything inappropriate			0

' @entity125 acknowledged @entity22 's testimony was ' clearly ... a violation ' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call , which took place about six weeks before her son 's death			1
however , he added that he had not specifically told her not to mention in their preparations for testimony			0
' it did not come up , ' @entity125 said			0
@entity8 's lawyers argued that there is not enough evidence to show his client is responsible for the baby 's death			1

troubled history : @entity22 ( pictured left in 2009 ) became pregnant again after losing her son but her second child was taken away by the state in 2012 the matter was dropped , though , after she failed to turn up for a court hearing			2
in 2010 , @entity22 found out she was pregnant again and gave birth to another son in september of that year			2
