the mayor of an @entity2 town was forced to resign last night after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent @entity5 from his constituency			2
@entity7 , who is also a councillor for @entity2 's centre - right political party @entity9 , apologised for stating he found ‘ black @entity5 ’ to be aggressive and bad - mannered after he caused widespread fury			1
however , the former mayor of @entity13 faces being jailed or fined for the outburst after an official complaint was made to @entity2 's police force , known as gardaí			1
former mayor : @entity7 has resigned after provoking outrage by declaring he would no longer represent @entity5 from his constituency politicians and anti-racism groups had demanded mr @entity25 ’s expulsion , while a @entity27 mp has reported the father of two ’s remarks to gardaí under the incitement to @entity32			1
‘ i realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that i did not intend , ’ mr @entity25 said in a statement			1
‘ i abhor racism in all its forms			2
i have been proud to be mayor of @entity13 and to represent all the people of the town			2
however , as a result of the upset that i have caused , i feel it is appropriate that i step down from this position			2
’ if convicted by gardaí , mr @entity25 could face six months to two years in jail or fines ranging from € 1,000 to € 10,000			2
he made the controversial remarks live on the town 's @entity50 radio station @entity49 yesterday morning			1
@entity7 in fancy dress wtih a model criticising the manner in which black @entity5 asked for his help in getting on social housing lists , mr @entity25 said he would no longer deal with them			1
‘ i have been met with aggressiveness , i have been met with bad manners , ’ he said during the radio interview			1
‘ i have also been played the race card			0
‘ [ they ’ve ] said : “ oh yeah you ’ll help white people , but you do n’t help black people			0
” ’ he added : ‘ so after a while of this ... i ’ve been doing this now for six or seven years – i just made the decision , a conscious decision , earlier this year , that i just was not going to , myself personally , was not going to take on representations from black @entity5			1
‘ i would be very courteous to them and i would pass on their queries to other representatives , who would take their concerns			0
’ politicians , equality organisations and minorities support groups all rushed to condemn the comments			1
@entity9 had issued a statement within an hour distancing themselves from his comments and promising that there would be a formal investigation at party level			1
‘ the views expressed by @entity25 do not reflect the views of @entity9 , and they are not party policy , ’ the statement read			1
‘ @entity9 is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all			1
’ former @entity27 mp @entity93 warned yesterday that comments such as those by mr @entity25 would represent the ‘ beginning of official racism ’ in @entity2			1
the country ’s first @entity98 mp , who served as a mp for @entity100 from 1992 to 1997 , warned that such comments from a @entity9 councillor could lead to official state racism if left unchecked			1
‘ this is really , really frightening because it could be the beginning of state racism in this country , ’ dr @entity93 said			0
‘ there is a small @entity110 following in this country you know , and this just adds to what they see as enlightenment			0
it ’s important now more than ever that our racism laws be strengthened			0
’ schoolboy @entity120 is reluctant to play with @entity25 and @entity121 on the 2007 campaign trail the psychiatrist said he had been abused in the past himself and he called on the government to introduce a new paper on racism as the law is clearly deficient in this area			0
and even though mr @entity25 resigned as mayor last night , dr @entity93 believes he should also be expelled from @entity9			1
‘ i ’ve been abused myself in the past too , people feel they ’re entitled to , but the law of the land says no. ‘ @entity25 is still a public representative , he should be expelled from @entity9 after this and i ’m calling for that			1
’ the association campaigning for equality in sport , @entity139 , was appalled by the comments and said it was clearly discrimination			1
‘ the qualification for mr @entity25 ’s comments that “ i am not racist ” is bizarre , ’ @entity139 co-ordinator @entity142 said			1
‘ there can not be an acceptance of racism within politics in @entity2			0
’ @entity149 , chief executive of the @entity150 , said : ‘ negative stereotypes create racism , and as we saw earlier this week when a @entity154 taxi driver was assaulted , this can lead to violence			0
‘ we all have a role to play in counteracting negative stereotypes and our elected officials have a special role to play in promoting tolerance and inclusion throughout the community			0
@entity25 ’s comments are outrageous and not worthy of an elected representative			1
’ @entity166 , an @entity167 mp for mr @entity25 ’s constituency , @entity169 , said the remarks were ‘ outrageous ’ and ‘ totally unacceptable ’			0
she described as ‘ unfathomable ’ the reasons why he felt the need to make such a statement			2
‘ while listening to @entity174 this morning i could scarcely believe what i was hearing			0
‘ it ’s right and proper that @entity25 step down as mayor of @entity13 immediately and i welcome his decision to do so			0
‘ however , it ’s essential that if he remains as a public representative he must undertake to represent all of the people , without qualification or prejudice			0
’ taxi driver @entity185 , who is originally from @entity154 , met mr @entity25 last month after he drove him home to @entity186 in @entity13			0
the 44 - year - old , who has lived in @entity13 since 2000 , said : ‘ the racial issue in @entity13 is becoming so bad for the past three years – it ’s becoming an epidemic			2
but it ’s a big shock to me to hear him say those comments as a young man , it ’s unbelievable			2
‘ what ’s happening in @entity13 are discussions about what the black community is doing to the town			0
for instance , some people say we are taking their jobs and taking over the place			0
this should not be the attitude of some of the public			0
we are in a different century			0
‘ i came to @entity2 for a better life but now my wife , @entity211 , and i just make sure our children are safe and have a better upbringing			0
‘ if this situation continues , how are my children able to live in a country where they have been brought up with such racial issues ? ’			2
