five officials with connections to @entity2 and who were all involved in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity5 are at the centre of a @entity8 criminal investigation , according to the man who wants to be @entity2 ’s next president			1
and @entity12 , a former long - standing @entity2 insider who is the only currently declared rival to @entity13 for next year ’s presidential race , has told the @entity15 that if any of the five are found guilty of wrong - doing , the entire bidding process should be invalidated			1
@entity17 was awarded the 2018 tournament and @entity19 the 2022 event in a vote that happened four years ago next month			1
but corruption allegations have persistently swirled around those decisions and @entity2 announced last week they had lodged a criminal complaint with the @entity25 of @entity8 into ‘ the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 @entity5			1
’ @entity12 told the @entity15 that five @entity2 officials are to face a @entity8 criminal investigation no information has been confirmed by @entity2 about the number of individuals or their identities although it is believed more than one are @entity38 voters who influenced the destination of the 2018 and 2022 events			1
this development came amid the ongoing controversy of the @entity2 ethics judge @entity43 ’s summary of @entity2 investigator @entity46 ’s investigation into the process			1
‘ i am a strong defender of the principle of innocent until proven guilty but it is clear that what is at stake is enormous , ’ @entity12 told @entity15			1
‘ we need to know how the voting unfolded and how it was influenced			0
even if one vote was improperly influenced that is too many			0
‘ was it one or none ? or five ? if it was five then is that enough to change outcome ? yes			0
@entity19 won 14 - 8			0
the problem is we need to know and we do n’t know			0
’ corruption allegations have swirled around the decision to award @entity17 and @entity63 @entity12 added that it is his belief that @entity2 ’s probe into corruption allegations is effectively ongoing			1
‘ it is an unfinished @entity2 ethics investigation … the request [ to the @entity8 attorney general ] is about five officials of @entity2			1
’ @entity12 called for the full findings of @entity46 ’s report to be made public , even though @entity43 has insisted that will never happen			2
‘ i ’ve consistently and repeatedly called for transparency , ’ @entity12 said			2
‘ what has happened over the past week only reinforces the need for that , more than ever			0
‘ it has been almost four since that vote on 2 december 2010 and it continues to make me sad that the @entity82 , the pinnacle of our game , remains tainted			0
we need to know what happened			0
’ this @entity88 fan holds up a sign towards the end of the @entity91 , saying ' see you @entity17 2018 ' @entity43 ’s 42 - page summary caused huge controversy in identifying - and then traducing - two whistleblowers who gave extensive assistance to @entity46			2
@entity97 , a former @entity99 bid insider , and @entity100 , who worked for @entity19 , spoke out in these pages last week about their disgust at their treatment			0
they both subsequently made formal complaints to @entity2 about @entity43 allegedly breaching article 16.1 of @entity2 ’s own ethics code in making them clearly identifiable in his summary			2
they have not even received any acknowledgement of their complaint , let alone any explanation			0
‘ i was stunned that the whistleblowers were described in the way they were so that they could be identified , ’ @entity12 says			2
‘ they are courageous people and they were failed by this report			0
’ @entity43 effectively dismissed both mersiades and @entity100 as inaccurate and unreliable			0
but the @entity15 can exclusively reveal that @entity46 found them so valuable to his intelligence - gathering that he used tens of thousands of dollars of @entity2 money to facilitate meeting them			1
meanwhile , campaigning mp @entity120 , who has a track record of pushing for @entity2 reform , has secured a parliamentary debate on december 1 in the @entity124 on the subject of the @entity126 and @entity2			2
it is expected that various allegations of corruption surrounding the world governing body and the 2018 and 2022 process will be aired under parliamentary privilege .			1
