a @entity2 @entity1 user has posted a video of what he claims is the ' world 's ugliest @entity6 sweater ' , which features a working toy train set and colorful festive lights			1
the sweater is showcased in a newly - released video by @entity12 and was made using a knitted sweatshirt found at @entity14 which the anonymous @entity2 accessorized using a variety of over-the - top festive decorations , including a toy train set and snowy scenery , and a string of colored festive lights			1
and as if that was n't enough , the video also highlights a variety of other functions for the quirky knitted creation , including using the train set scenery to serve drinks at a party or wearing the warm sweater while out walking your dog			1
this holiday season has already seen a huge increase in the number of ugly @entity6 sweaters being sold - and bought - throughout the @entity61			0
last week , fashion website @entity62 announced that it has launched a @entity6 sweater hire scheme , which enables customers to rent ugly festive knitwear for the bargain price of $ 15 for four days , rather than splashing out and buying their own			0
the website 's @entity6 capsule collection features 12 different vintage designs , ranging from the awkwardly traditional to the over-the - top ridiculous , with one sweater even featuring a 3d puppet which had been sewn onto the front of it			0
see full video here going into detail : the scenery featured on the sweater is incredibly ornate - and festive warning : @entity82 's video comes complete with a number of cautions for anyone who dares to try and recreate the sweater themselves but nothing in @entity62 's selection - nor indeed in any other ugly sweater retailer 's collections - quite compares with bd594 's creation			2
wearing such an ornately - decorated sweater does have its drawbacks however , as the @entity1 makes sure to point out in his video with a number of clearly - demonstrated warnings			2
' caution ! ! ! when wearing outdoors , ' one clip says , while another , no doubt aimed at any holiday party - goers , advises : ' when drinking remember not to put your sweater on backwards			0
' the sweater has certainly proved popular with bd594 's @entity1 viewers , many of whom have been quick to congratulate the video maker on his festive innovation .			1
