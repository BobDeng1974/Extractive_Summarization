@entity30 said @entity8 , who has been using the last name @entity16 and posing as an orphan , told him she was 18 years old			2

tricked : @entity30 , 23 ( left ) , has been dating @entity8 ( right ) since last summer @entity37 told @entity43 last month that @entity8 first contacted her in april claiming to be a 14 - year - old girl in need of help			1

' she was living with her guardian , @entity53 , in @entity7 at the time , but made no mention of that to @entity37			0
their relationship culminated on @entity58 when @entity8 took a train to @entity40 to visit @entity37 , even bringing her a homemade holiday card			0
but over the course of @entity8 ’s visit , @entity37 's sister became suspicious , pointing out to her that the high school sophomore had the body of a grown woman			0

according to school officials , ms @entity8 came to @entity23 last october accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth - grader			1
during the enrollment process , @entity8 gave the name @entity16 and indicated that she was 15 years old			2
@entity96 , 30 , who took on the role of @entity8 's guardian last march , told the station @entity99 the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father , who has since died along with her mother			2
scam : @entity8 enrolled in @entity23 in @entity7 , @entity2 , last october , claiming she was a home - school student without any prior transcripts the two women met while working together at a @entity106 's located inside the local @entity107 , and @entity8 confided in @entity53 that she had no place to stay after losing her parents			1

she even attended parent - teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore ’s impressive academic performance			0
' she acted like a kid			0
she got good report cards , ' the 30 - year - old @entity7 resident told @entity43			1
@entity8 ’s web of lies began unraveling when @entity68 got a call from @entity37 , the head of the @entity40 - based charity			0
playing the victim : @entity8 was taken in by a @entity129 after allegedly lying to her that she had been abused as a child and that her parents have died @entity133 doubts : @entity53 ( left ) , @entity8 's guardian , and her mentor , @entity136 ( right ) , became suspicious about her identity and went to police ms @entity37 told @entity68 that she ran a background check on ' @entity16 , ' which provided more questions than answers			1
@entity68 then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the @entity106 where both she and @entity144 worked			0
the staffer pulled up the high - schooler 's file , which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and her real name @entity8			2
on may 13 , @entity68 and the phony orphan ’s mentor , @entity136 , alerted police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school			0
school officials said @entity8 came in last october as a home - schooled student without any prior transcripts			1
officers who responded to @entity68 ’s @entity7 home asked @entity8 to identify herself , and in response she gave them the name @entity16 – the same moniker used on her school application			1
sticking to her ruse : hours before her arrest monday night , @entity8 posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the @entity170 user name @entity171 sob story : ms @entity8 told @entity68 , her co-worker at a @entity106 's who is four years her senior , that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live online persona : on @entity177 and @entity178 , @entity8 called herself ' @entity179 ' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager the woman was charged with failure to identify / giving false , fictitious information			1
looking at @entity8 ’s fake @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity170 account created under the nickname @entity188 , it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes			0
in the photos posted online , @entity8 looks like a shy , fresh - faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure			0
however , in her booking photo , @entity8 dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years , with a lined , puffy face and a tangle of hair .			2
