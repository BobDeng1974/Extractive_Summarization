expensive clothes , fast cars and glittering industry parties : to the average person , the lives of the rich and famous may seem way out of reach			0
but the growing slew of celebrity gaming apps , from the likes of @entity10 and @entity11 ( and soon , @entity12 ) , promise to immerse you in it all , temporarily			1
@entity15 investigates what it 's like to ' live ' the life of a celebrity for a day			1
users have to build a celebrity empire similar to @entity10 's the 34 - year - old launched the highly lucrative app last june , and has an estimated 28 million downloads @entity10 's highly lucrative app , @entity10 : @entity21 , developed by @entity33 , has already been downloaded an estimated 28 million times since it was launched last june			1
the quest - based adventure game requires users to create a character ( customising a ' cute ' look is compulsory ) , become friends with @entity10 and then embark on social - climbing , empire - building adventures			1
the character of @entity10 , voiced by the reality star herself , is your best friend in the game you 're @entity48 at the beginning of the game , your character works in retail , takes public transport everywhere , her apartment is essentially bare and ca n't even afford to adopt stray cats			1
that is , until you meet @entity10 by chance ( voiced by the reality star herself ) , and she slowly introduces you into the industry			2
the game puts an emphasis in being charming and friendly to almost everyone , and also taking every opportunity take every opportunity at the beginning , your boss trusts you to lock up the clothes shop , and @entity10 turns up begging you to help her			2
you are given no choice but to break into the shop , choose her an outfit and give it to her for free			0
luckily she rewards you by inviting you to a impromptu photo shoot			0
this type of sporadic activity is rife throughout the game and actively encouraged			0
@entity76 and charm is key obediently completing mini-quests will win you cash and k - stars ( which you can collect by paying real money ) , but as is expected , to actually complete many of the tasks and buy new clothes , money is also required			2
kustomise yourself : it 's necessary to constantly change your outfit and appearance in order to fit in at all the industry events @entity91 is everything within ten minutes of living @entity10 's life , users have changed their outfits three times and checked their reflections twice			1
seemingly , no one makes it big in @entity21 without constantly considering how their image can be improved			2
@entity103 's @entity102 ( pictured left ) makes an appearance in the game			0
no doubt as a career booster people fit into 3 categories strangely , it seems @entity10 is your only friend in the game , and you 'd be wrong if you think you 're allowed to make new ones			1
characters fit into solely three categories : potential love - interests , career - boosters , or an arch - nemesis			1
your very own ' momager ' : early on in the game , @entity10 sites that a necessity of making it in the game involves having your own ' momager ' ( mother / manager ) , just like real - life parent @entity129 ( pictured right - in the game ) ( pictured left to right ) the cartoon recreations of @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity10 and @entity129			1
they are characters you eventually meet later in the game you 'll need a ' @entity136 ' one of the first things @entity10 mentions to you is that you need a ' momager '			2
@entity129 , @entity10 's very own , makes an appearance later in the game			1
you eventually also meet @entity10 's real life family , who have all lent their likeness and voice to the app. this includes @entity129 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity147 and @entity148 ( but no @entity149 )			1
opportunities for fame come in all shapes of sizes , including dating ( and marrying ) people for exposure you have to do things you do n't want to although the game allows you to fly to @entity159 with @entity147 , and hang out with @entity103 's @entity160 eventually , you have to do many things that are n't entirely favourable			2
this includes : dating ( and marrying ) people you do n't want to for exposure , ' charming ' people with k - stars ( which is a currency in the game ) and partaking in sketchy photo shoots			0
@entity169 : @entity11 also launched her own game , @entity171 uncanny : @entity11 's game is a lot sillier and almost works to poke fun at celebrity culture @entity11 's game is comparatively sillier , and works more as a tongue - in - cheek critique of celebrity culture			1
if living a day in the life of @entity11 can be derived purely from playing her game , it 's a lot sillier and crass than @entity10 's			1
although in both games you 're similarly working towards meteoric fame , in @entity11 's you play for fans			1
you begin the game with no identity and no fans			0
fans are earned by spending coins on items that will boost your star status			0
players must try and collect as many fans as possible , by engaging in ridiculous or unfavourable activities all the fans : success in @entity11 's game is judged by how many fans you can generate and also how quickly you can ankle @entity200 will win you fans oddly enough , ankle bracelets are one of the purchases that can be used to win fans at a faster rate			1
here 's where the silly element of @entity11 's app really rears its head			1
@entity11 's game offers less trend - led outfits as @entity10 's and seems to criticise the vacuity of showbiz looks are n't everything unlike @entity10 's app , @entity11 's game instantly tells you at the beginning , while you 're choosing your outfit : ' do n’t worry , nothing is permanent in show business			1
' your character starts off completely naked , with just stars covering her private areas			0
the game almost seems to critique the humiliating , vacuous process of turning into a @entity21 star			2
rather than placing an emphasis on outfits and make - up , it 's more about the ridiculous things you can choose to do			2
to generate fans quicker , you can choose to invest in publicity stunts , which include releasing nude selfies , having an elevator fights and even faking your death @entity242 activities are the norm publicity investments can bring you an endless barrage of fame and increase your notoriety			0
options include : leaking a nude selfie , releasing a ghostwritten rap album , having an elevator fight , buying bum implants ( one cheek at a time no less ) , faking your death , and sleeping with a poet laureate			0
other investments also include phony rap beefs and nip slips			0
among the ridiculous activities that can bring you press and publicity , you can also choose to engage in embarrassing photo shoots ( pictured ) it 's the little things that count again , the idea of using money to directly buy your fame and influence is a key idea			2
coconut water and paparazzi repellent are amongst the ridiculous things you can purchase that will earn you fans			0
@entity12 : unnamed app to be released at the end of 2015 , the pop star has teamed up with none other than the app developers of @entity10 's lucrative app : @entity33			1
the app is likely to work on the same premise as @entity10 's , whereby users attempt to become @entity21 celebrities			1
but specifics have not yet been announced			0
@entity284 : @entity286 writer , @entity287 inspired by the actor 's real - life fascination with type - writers , the app recreates the nostalgic experience of an actual type - writer ( noise and imagery included ) , but with the easy functionality of an @entity297			2
in september of last year , the app topped the @entity300 charts			0
@entity301 : ask @entity301 , @entity287 in the style of a @entity305 , the actor 's app allows befuddled users to ask him for advice			2
it generates hilarious @entity301 - appropriate answers that will see you through any problem			0
@entity312 : @entity313 , £ 0.79 the first thing to consider before downloading the actor 's app , is the warning : ' explicit '			0
it works as a soundboard , whereby the user can select famous lines and @entity321 will deliver them with recordings of his world - famous sass ( and profanity )			0
@entity326 : @entity326 - oke , £ 2.99 exactly what is says on the tin , users can test their knowledge of the diva 's lyrics and vocal abilities			1
it uses voice recognition software to tell how well you can hit @entity326 's high notes			0
@entity338 : @entity339 , @entity287 wildly popular , the app transforms users into virtual ' gangsters ' with the help of digital stickers			0
there are sunglasses , wads of cash , gold ' bling ' and neon wristwatches .			0

@entity10 : @entity21 and @entity11 's @entity354 apps
users create an *aspiring* celebrity and rise to fame in the games
everyone is either a potential love - interest , career - booster , or enemy
