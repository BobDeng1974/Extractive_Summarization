by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has come under fire for ' fatshaming ' after revealing how she put on four stone just to prove she can lose it again			1
the controversial columnist went on tv yesterday morning to tell how she has gone from from 8st 8lb to 12st so she can attempt to show how easy it is for overweight people to diet			1
but her latest project has been met with outrage - with many hoping the 39 - year - old will never be able to lose the extra pounds			0
@entity2 , 39 , has piled on the pounds over the last three months and now weights 12st @entity2 has always been slim and healthy but ate 6,500 calories per day so she could put on the weight several viewers took to @entity17 to criticise @entity2 for her weight - loss experiment			1
one said she was ' ignorant ' and that not all weight gain is intentional or avoidable after her appearance on yesterday 's @entity23 , others took to @entity17 to criticise @entity24 for allowing her ' fattist ' attitude to be ' sensationalised ' on air			1
the backlash even led to a group hashtag , # @entity30 , being set up on the social networking site , under which viewers told the outspoken columnist exactly what they thought of her			1
meanwhile , weight loss expert @entity35 , who fronts tv show @entity37 , said @entity2 's latest project shows a ' shallow ' approach to weightloss and does not take into account the emotional mindset of those who struggle to lose weight			1
he said : ' @entity2 has a point , that a lot of people make excuses about why they ca n't lose weight			1
and it 's not expensive to lose weight			1
' but it is very shallow to think it is just about food and that you can just put weight on and off			1
there are emotional undercurrents that have to be dealt with when someone is trying to lose weight			1
' the biggest factor is the mindset and motivation , not the food			0
i do n't think this latest project is helping anyone			0
' @entity64 , chair of the @entity65 on @entity66 is as follows , added that @entity2 had taken a ' simplistic view '			2
she told @entity1 : ‘ whilst i certainly wish ms @entity2 well in her endeavours i do think she is taking a very simplistic view of weight and is making the issue all about food			1
her tv project - called to fat and back - will see her try to lose the weight again , in a bid to prove it is easy for those who are overweight to diet ' anyone who has spent any time working with those struggling with eating disorders knows that many people have complex and difficult relationships with food and exercise			1
' to try to define all those who are overweight as somehow lazy or lacking in will power does a huge disservice to the experts who have made tackling obesity their focus			2
' whilst i do think this project has challenged ms @entity2 ’ views as to what it is like to be overweight , generally she has played down the emotional aspects of gaining weight which can then lead to negative body image , lack of self - esteem and confidence			1
' however , i do hope this publicity stunt does something to highlight the problems we face as a nation in addressing some of the very serious issues surrounding weight and body image			0
’ @entity2 revealed on the show how she embarked on the scheme - ' to fat and @entity113 ' - after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size			1
she is now planning on losing the weight for a tv documentary on @entity119 that will air next year			2
others were supportive of @entity2 's campaign , agreeing with her point that there should be ' no excuses ' after her plans were revealed , @entity17 user @entity125 wrote : ' ignorant sow , not all weight gain is intentional / avoidable # thyroid and other illnesses play a pary # boreoff ' while @entity132 said : ' shocked at sensationalising of that woman 's attitude to weight			1
weight loss is a struggle			1
the former @entity140 contestant is well - known for her outspoken views			0
she previously told an obese woman on this morning that she would n't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy			0
' people have always said to me , " you 're lucky , you 're skinny , " and i just do n't think these excuses are cutting it any more			0
' i saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat			0
i just thought , we have to put an end to this			0
' some have said @entity2 's latest project - which saw her consume a high fat and sugar diet - is not helping anyone her comments led to a wave of @entity17 users urging @entity2 to fail in her attempt to lose weight			1
one user wrote : ' i 'm praying to all the gods that @entity2 does n't manage to lose weight ' while another said : ' @entity169 i hope she struggles to lose it			1
' but although several viewers were offended by her comments , there were some who supported @entity2 's view			1
@entity175 took to @entity17 to say she ' could n't agree more ' , while another said @entity2 had come across as ' compassionate and relatively understanding '			1
another said it was ' important ' for the obesity crisis in the @entity181 that @entity2 carries out this experiment			1
but @entity183 , a mental health campaigner , warned in an article in the @entity186 that the ' experimental ' challenge - based weight loss would not address the issue behind obesity			1
she said it was about those who have ' struggled for years ' or feel ' hopeless or depressed '			0
she wrote : ' @entity2 might dip her foot in but she 'll quickly pull it out and shake it off			2
in a clip shown on the programme , the columnist is seen breaking down in tears and saying ' i hate fat people for making me do this ' - which provoked a lot of angry reaction			0
others said she could be doing more worthwhile projects , pictured top ' we need to listen to those who have struggled for years , who ca n't afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables , who do n't have the provisions or services they need to help them along the way , who might have given up trying and feel hopeless or depressed			0
' writing in the @entity218 , writer @entity217 also criticised @entity2 ' latest project			2
she said : ' i ca n't speak on behalf of fat people because i am only one of them , but in my own current state of fatness i can tell you this : i am fully aware of the excuses we sometimes use and i am actually an advocate of dropping the excuses too , but not in terms of weightloss or overeating but rather in terms of living a happier more healthier life where food is n't the enemy , and allowing fat people who chose to remain fat to be allowed to do so			0
' speaking on the programme , @entity2 defended what she was doing and said it had even helped her see things from a different perspective			2
she said : ' it turns out that the reason i like to stay super strong and very slim is that i suffer from epilepsy			0
@entity246 said she agreed with the controversial columnist , top , and @entity175 , bottom , also said she ' could n't agree more ' with @entity2 's view ' so i want to be able to show i 'm still as strong as the next person , that just because my arm dislocates 36 times a year because i have fits , i am still fit and able			2
' so it 's actually a similar reason for being thin to other people 's reasons for being fat			0
it 's about me now saying that i realise my skinny self was my armour			0
' so for me so far , halfway through this project the conclusion has been that there are reasons for being overweight , but there are still no excuses			0
' but also , i want to say let 's recognise that i 'm not lucky to be skinny , it 's eating too much and no exercise that make you like that			0
' she added : ' i 'm sick of being like this - i 'm sick of the feeling of my stomach sitting on my legs - it 's tiring being this fat , carrying all of this around			0
@entity2 said piling on the weight has been a traumatic experience for her and said it made her cry for the first time in years ' my idea is not to lose weight like one of those celeb people - i 'm not going to have a nutritionist , a trainer or access to a posh gym - i 'm just going to put my old trainers on and get to it			1
' we can all come up with excuses			0
i 'm just trying to say , have you actually got excuses ? ' what 's so great about this whole project is that there 's a whole league of men and women who want to come on this journey to lose the weight with me now			2
kind of like a " lose it with @entity2			2
" ' in her column for the @entity311 at the weekend , @entity2 revealed that being overweight was the first thing to make her cry for a long time			2
she said : ' i did n’t cry at my weddings			0
i did n’t cry giving birth			0
but gaining weight reduced me to a blubbering wreck			0
@entity2 has made no secret of the fact she struggles to sympathise with those who are overweight ' i hate everything about being fat			2
i hate the way it feels			0
my thighs chafe against each other and are sore , my belly sits on top of my thighs and my boobs get in the way			0
' a spokeswoman for the channel which will be airing the programme said : ' @entity2 has been very outspoken about her prejudices towards overweight people			1
' this documentary will confront her attitudes and put her beliefs to the test , by following her own physical and emotional journey as she gains and loses weight , whilst exploring the broader issues of body image in our society			2
' she will start to lose the weight from september 8 .			2

@entity2 ate 6,500 calories a day for three months so she could put on 4 stone
