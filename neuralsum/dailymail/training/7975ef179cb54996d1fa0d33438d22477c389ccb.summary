by @entity0 forget @entity3 , the pushiest parents in the world are those who want their children to be the best in the cutthroat world of modern dance in the @entity8 @entity10 viewers will get the chance to see just how competitive the pastime is when the new series of @entity14 airs on @entity15 next week			1
the reality tv show goes behind the scenes at @entity18 's renowned @entity14 , owned and operated by the formidable @entity19			1
checking up : the ' dance moms ' watch as their children rehearse looking for the best : dance teacher @entity19 , right , watches the girls perform no sugar - coating : @entity19 is n't afraid to tell the children what she really thinks of their dancing competitive : the girls ( and their mothers ) are desperate to be the best best behaviour : how the mothers act can influence whether @entity19 gives their daughter a starring role @entity19 is so determined to find the best dancers , she pushes children to be the best they can be - and does n't spare their feelings if she thinks they are not up to scratch			1
her appraisals of auditions make @entity40 look soft			0
she uses phrases such as ' only number one is good enough ! ' and ' quit that crying cr * * ! ' when the children perform			2
@entity19 says : ' i 'm not looking for somebody to be second place			0
i want a member who stretches every night before they go to bed , i want kids who can learn a routine in one day and compete the next			2
' she adds : ' i want kids that want it , that want to be the best they can be			0
' at war : the dance moms compete with one another to help their daughters get ahead looking older than their years : the girls wear make - up and have perfectly groomed hair for their performances practise makes perfect : the boys and girls perfect their moves children can learn to dance at the @entity14 from the age of two but @entity14 follows a troupe aged eight and above who are competing to win coveted awards in solo and group categories			1
their routines must be flawless with an appearance to match			0
sequined outfits , tonnes of make - up and perfectly groomed hair are all de rigueur			2
and as the title of the show suggests , behind every girl vying to be number one , is a mother pushing them all the way			1
this leads to bickering , back - stabbing and tantrums - all from the mothers			1
' it 's not fair ! you get special treatment for your daughter ! ' says one of the mothers in the opening episode as they fall out over who @entity19 has selected to do the latest dance solos			2
pick me ! the dancers compete for places in solo and group routines in or out : @entity19 's decision is final when it comes to picking dancers for important performances high standards : the dancer instructor is looking for girls who stretch every night and want to be the best the girls are told : ' second place is n't good enough ' support : the mothers are there for every rehearsal and show it seems the mothers have to fight one another to get their child ahead - as if they pick their battles with @entity19 , it 's their child who will be punished			1
one mother learns this at her daughter 's cost at an open audition in @entity134 in the opening episode			0
when she tells @entity19 her daughter did n't dance well because she did n't hear the initial instruction to start on her left foot , the child is immediately dropped			0
' who is your daughter ? you just humiliated her stage in front of all these people , she 's out , ' @entity19 shouts dismissing the heartbroken young girl from the competition			2
one of the experienced ' dance moms ' then tells the outspoken mother : ' a word of advice , do n't speak out against @entity19 , she hates it when you stand up for your kid			0
' as the mothers ca n't win against @entity19 , they wage war on one another instead			0
in the first episode of series four , which airs on monday on @entity15 , they accuse one another of trying to sabotage one another 's daughter 's routines or trying to win @entity19 's favour by buying her gifts			0
