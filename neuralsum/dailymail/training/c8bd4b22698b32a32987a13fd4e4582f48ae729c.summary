many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier			1
but research has found children can spot this tactic , and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them			1
once spotted , a study from the @entity11 found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves			1
children can tell when adults are omitting information or bending the truth , ( illustrated with a stock image ) , according to a new report from the @entity11			1
once this tactic has been spotted , the children will try to fill in gaps in the information themselves children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions			1
one group of children received a toy that had four buttons , each of which activated a different function , while the other group was given a toy with one button			2
then the children watched as a ‘ teacher ’ demonstrated the toy – only pointing out one function			2
the children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was , using a scale from 1 to 20			2
children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy ’s only function			1
in a follow - up experiment , the same ‘ teacher ’ demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions			2
children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly , suggesting that they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative			2
determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people , explained @entity69 , lead author of the paper which is published in the journal @entity72			0
‘ when someone provides us information , we not only learn about what is being taught , we also learn something about that person			2
if the information is accurate and complete , then you might also trust that person in the future , ’ she said			1
‘ but if this person has taught you something wrong , has made a mistake , or has omitted something that ’s important for you to know , then you might want to suspend your trust , be sceptical of the information he provides in the future , and even seek other sources of information			1
’ the study builds on a 2011 paper in which the team of researchers investigated how children behave when a teacher explained only one function of a toy that can do four different things			1
they found children spent most of their time exploring only the function the teacher had demonstrated			1
however , children who received no instruction spent more time exploring all of the toy ’s features and ended up discovering more of them			0

the new research looks at their reaction to the teacher			0
an image of a child playing is pictured in the new study , dr @entity69 wanted to investigate what children thought of the teacher who did not fully explain what the toy could do			1
she said : ‘ previous studies about children ’s trust in informants or teachers focused on whether children distinguish , and learn differentially from someone who says something false from someone who ’s telling the truth			0
‘ going beyond those sensitivities to truth and falseness , what i wanted to see in this study is whether children are also sensitive to someone who ’s telling the truth but not the whole truth - someone who did n’t tell them everything that they ought to know			1
’ in the experiment , children who had to work out additional functions of the toy distrusted a teacher 's explanation about a second one ( stock image ) in the first experiment , children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions			1
one group of children received a toy that had four buttons , each of which activated a different function , while the other group was given a toy with only one button and function			0
then the children watched as a ‘ teacher ’ puppet demonstrated the toy to a ‘ student ’ puppet			0
for both toys , the teacher ’s instruction was the same			0
he demonstrated only one function - the windup mechanism			0
after the demonstration , the children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was , using a scale from one to 20			0
children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy ’s only function			2
in a follow - up experiment , the same ‘ teacher ’ demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions			0
children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly , suggesting they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative			0
‘ this shows that children are not just sensitive to who ’s right or wrong , ’ dr @entity69 said			0
‘ [ they ] can evaluate others based on who ’s providing information that is enough or not enough for accurate inference			0
they can also adjust how they learn from a teacher in the future , depending on whether the teacher has previously committed a sin of omission or not			0

a study by @entity11 found children can spot when information is being deliberately held back
if they think they *'re* being lied to , they will try to fill in the gaps themselves
children use this to *decide* who is a *trustworthy* source for the future
they are more sceptical of adults who have held back information before
researchers used toys with various functions to come to their conclusions
