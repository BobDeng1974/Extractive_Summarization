as @entity1 celebrated the goals that vanquished @entity3 on thursday evening , the eagle - eyed among you may have noticed that the @entity5 crest on his shirt has four gold stars above it			1
surely that ca n’t be right ? we all know that @entity5 have only won the @entity11 on two occasions , so surely they ’ve stitched on a couple more on without really being entitled to them ? after all , in @entity11 ’s equipment regulations , section 18.2 states : ‘ @entity15 that have won the @entity11 may put a symbol on the playing shirt representing this accomplishment and the number of times won			1
’ too many stars ? the crest on @entity1 's shirt is adorned by four stars despite @entity5 only winning the @entity11 twice and all the other nations have the correct amount - @entity29 , of course , have their five stars ; @entity32 have four ; @entity33 three ; @entity34 two and @entity3 , @entity35 and @entity36 one apiece			1
it turns out that @entity5 ’s badge is a bit of an anomaly , but not an unjustified one			1
yes , they did win the @entity11 in 1930 and 1950 , as we all know , but they were twice world champions before that competition had even got off the ground			2
that ’s because the @entity46 - won by @entity5 in 1924 and 1928 - were officially recognised as the @entity11 world championships before the @entity11 as we now know it was founded in 1930			1
back in 1914 , @entity51 , the third president of the governing body and the man after whom the first @entity11 trophy was named , declared : ‘ under the condition that the @entity57 be organized in agreement with @entity11 rules , this competition will be recognised as a @entity50			2
’ history lesson : @entity5 are allowed an extra two stars because they won they won the @entity46 in 1924 and 1928 their first effort to organise this in 1920 ended in farce when @entity65 walked off the field in protest in the final against @entity69 , but they had greater luck four years later in @entity72			2
with more and more amateur players starting to turn professional , @entity11 exploited a loophole in the rules of the strictly - amateur @entity76 so the best teams in the world could compete			2
the players would take part and technically be considered ‘ amateurs ’ by the @entity76 as long as their own country ’s @entity80 compensated them for missing work			0
the official history of @entity11 states that the winners of these tournaments in 1924 and 1928 were therefore considered the official world champions			0
@entity5 were the best on the planet at the time and racked up 17 goals in four matches on their way to the gold medal match , where @entity95 were rolled over 3 - 0			0
big difference : @entity5 's crest ( left ) includes four stars , while @entity3 ( right ) can only boast one from 1966 four years later , in @entity100 , they defeated neighbours @entity34 in a replay to make it back - to - back wins and secure a second gold star			1
the @entity57 tournaments proved that a world football championship could be successfully staged and @entity51 soon moved to a grander vision - the @entity11			0
@entity5 proved quite good at that too , beating @entity34 4 - 2 in the 1930 final , and then stunning @entity29 in the @entity110 in 1950			0
so when @entity11 revised its constitution in 1950 , they formally recognised that @entity5 were four - time world champions			1
the badge , they will definitely feel , has been stuck with four stars for far too long			0
dozens of clubs around the world incorporate stars into their crests to represent achievements			0
proud : @entity120 ( left ) and @entity121 ( right ) are among the clubs to include stars on their shirts @entity126 , for example , can wear seven stars for each of their @entity130 victories ; @entity131 and @entity132 wear four , while @entity133 proudly marked their maiden win in 2012 with the symbol			1
@entity136 have a commemorative shirt with four stars for their @entity140 triumphs			0
in @entity3 , @entity120 wear two stars above their crest to mark back - to - back @entity144 wins in 1979 and 1980			1
@entity121 worked in a silver star to their badge to symbolise their success in 1982			0
the other @entity149 sides with stars are @entity151 ( two for their titles in 1900 and 1903 ) , @entity153 ( first team to win three league titles in a row between 1924 and 1926 ) and @entity157 ( their three major trophies - league title in 1962 , @entity159 in 1978 and @entity160 in 1981 )			1
other clubs take it to another level - @entity166 wear five , each star representing 10 @entity162 titles			0
@entity167 , meanwhile , gained their third star with a 30th @entity170 last season .			2

@entity11 allow countries to add a star to their crest if they win the @entity11
@entity5 have two trophies to their name but four stars on their badge
@entity3 have one star after victory at @entity182 in 1966
club sides including @entity120 and @entity167 also wear stars
