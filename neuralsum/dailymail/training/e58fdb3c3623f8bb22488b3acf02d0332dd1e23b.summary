@entity8 attorney @entity7 , who has filed the lawsuit against @entity11 police department , on behalf on the eleven women and one man , said : ' this is pervy , a peepshop ... there is no excuse			2
' his clients claim that when they were booked for @entity18 , which normally does not require changing into jail clothes , they were directed to change in a jail cell that had a wall - mounted security camera			1
caught on camera : a woman is filmed getting undressed in a police cell mr @entity7 first noticed the practice two years ago , while working on a case for two women arrested for @entity18 , who were told to strip even though they were about to be booked , according to @entity29			1
concerned by what he saw , he made a public request for more jail footage to see if a pattern emerged			2
' it appeared from my limited review that it was happening to women - attractive women , in particular , ' he told @entity39 5			0
one of the alleged victims , who has asked not to be identified , said : ' i thought it was maybe for seeing if we have contraband or something but we are already patted down			1
so then , why would there be a camera still ? ' in another case , a jailer allegedly asked one of the women who had changed into the jail uniform to go back into the cell and remove her underwear , saying it was jail protocol , mr @entity7 told the @entity55			1
' what possible security reason could they have … she ’s going to hang herself with her panties ? ' he said , adding that she was due to be released			0
however , captain @entity60 , of @entity61 , said it was a needed protocol to protect officers and inmates			1
' no excuse ' : attorney @entity7 claims filming in cells is like ' a peep show ' ' people who come into the corrections environment commonly hide narcotics , contraband , weapons or other miscellaneous things on their body or in their clothing , ' he said			0
a spokesman for @entity11 told @entity29 video surveillance was standard in holding cells , as was stripping and changing into jail clothes			2
they added there was no evidence of exploitation by the police			2
' we see no wrongdoing on the part of anyone at the jail , ' captain @entity60 said			0
many of the alleged victims had no idea they had been filmed until they were contacted by mr @entity7			1
one recalled feeling sick as she watched the footage for the first time , adding : ' i [ did n't ] believe my own eye			0
i felt sick to the stomach			0
' the alleged victims claim the recordings , which have to be kept by the police department under state laws for several years , are criminal voyeurism			1
one woman said she first realized she had been filmed when a jailer allegedly commented on the way she had used the toilet			0
' i felt even more violated because i knew they were watching , ' she said			0
architect @entity112 , who has designed 40 jail facilities , said : ' you do have lots of cameras , you do watch a lot of things but you can not watch anywhere where someone is using the shower , toilet facility or a changing area			2
' allegations : @entity11 police department is being sued by 11 women and a man a city attorney said the cameras were needed in case an inmate claimed they had been injured in the jail			1
captain @entity60 added the cameras were in plain sight and signs on doors state video surveillance is used			0
he told the @entity55 no one had complained about the practice before mr @entity7 got involved and added : ' all arrestes booked into the @entity141 are treated the exact same way			0
