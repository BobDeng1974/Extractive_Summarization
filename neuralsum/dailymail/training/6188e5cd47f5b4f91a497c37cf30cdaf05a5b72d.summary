an @entity1 theatre is the latest to offer so - called ' tweet seats ' where audience members are encouraged to post comments about the performance on the social messaging site			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , has formalised a growing trend in theatre audiences to use their phones from within auditoria by giving obsessive tweeters a section of their own			1
its management have roped off a special balcony - level section of the theatre ' that will not be disruptive to other patrons ' for the latest run of the servant with two masters			1
the @entity37 , @entity38 in @entity39 and the @entity40 in @entity41 have all reportedly experimented with special sections for visitors who ca n't keep off their phones			1
the trend has also even threatened @entity48 threatres , with critics expressing mixed feelings about the increasing tendency of audiences in @entity54 's @entity53 to reach for their phones during performances			1
' there 's little doubt that it disturbs other audience members , and probably even cast members , ' wrote @entity60 in @entity61 recently			1
some days in life will always be remembered , whether it ’s your wedding day , the birth of a child or a perfect holiday			2
other days - a family row , a stressful time at work or last - minute @entity71 shopping - are probably best forgotten			2
but for a growing band of ‘ lifeloggers ’ , every single day is recorded in minute detail and stored for future reference			2
fans say lifelogging allows them to create a perfect digital archive which can be accessed at any time , whether it ’s to recall a favourite moment in exact detail or simply check where they left their car keys			2
but critics argue it is a self - inflicted form of the @entity88 dystopia predicted by @entity90 ’s novel 1984 , in which every word and movement could be seen and scrutinised			2
lifeloggers seek to capture daily details , either through pictures and video stored on the internet or by recording the patterns of their mood , sleep , exercise or diet			0
so far , only a handful of users have broadcast their lives on the internet for others to see , but the popularity of blogging sites like @entity36 suggests that others will not hesitate as the technology becomes more available			1
' and , of course , one hopes that people are too busy concentrating on the action to fish their mobile out of their pocket or bag			0
' on the other hand , they are engaged enough to want a post a review			0
' in a classic case of ' if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em ' , theatres and auditoria offering tweet seats make an effort to locate them in an area where smartphone glow will not distract other customers			1
forward - thinking arts executives believe that social media could even be enrich the experience offered by the production			0
@entity137 director @entity136 said : ' if there were ever a @entity33 show to host @entity141 , it 's @entity142			0
' this cast is an incredible ensemble of comedians , and night after night they 're riffing and improvising - it 's the kind of show that makes you ask , " did they just say that ? " ' usually they did - and tweeting should be a great way to talk about it			0
' however , if past experience is anything to go by , there are unlikely to be too many insightful comments winging their way across the @entity158			0
@entity160 wrote on the subject in the @entity162 : ' according to actual postings during a concert featuring works of @entity166 , furnished by the @entity37 , withak53 wrote : “ music hall looks a lot prettier from the top balcony			0
” ' and hippielunatic tweeted : “ star spangled banner always chokes me up a bit in music hall			0
