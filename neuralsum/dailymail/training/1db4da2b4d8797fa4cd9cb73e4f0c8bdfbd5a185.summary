by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 08:11 est , 23 august 2013 @entity1 rang police and said her neighbour had stabbed her with a screwdriver a woman launched a hate campaign against her neighbour and filmed everything she did following a row over parking			1
@entity1 , 33 , fell out with @entity10 , 47 , shortly after @entity10 moved next door in their cul - de - sac in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but @entity20 then began accusing her of a series of crimes			1
she rang police and claimed @entity10 had stabbed her with a screwdriver and a set of keys			2
she also alleged that ms @entity10 smashed into her with a car and used her keys to scratch her vehicle			1
police investigated all the allegations and dismissed them as lies and @entity20 was handed a harassment notice			2
but she then began using a video camera to film @entity10 day and night - often recording her thorough her kitchen window			1
she set up a constant ' surveillance ' of @entity10 's front garden			2
she filmed everyone who entered ms @entity10 's home for nearly eight weeks			1
now @entity20 has been given a restraining order by @entity42 banning her from recording @entity10 ’s home address			1
@entity10 , 47 , who fled @entity44 with her children in 2001 , said problems began with a parking dispute			2
she said : ' it has been a very unhappy nightmare			0
' i ’ve had so many different people knock on my door questioning me - that is really scary , even if you know you ’ve done nothing wrong			0
' it ’s really difficult to cope			0
' i am a quiet person , i do n’t like conflict , i do n’t understand why she ’s doing it			0
' three times she said i ran her over			0
it frightened me because i ’d look out the window and see police looking underneath my car and your heart starts pounding			0
the pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but @entity20 then began accusing her neighbour of running her over @entity20 's hate campaign - which included filming her neighbour - was triggered by a row over parking ' once she phoned the police in front of me and said , ‘ help me , my neighbour ’s stabbing me ’ and they were out straight away			1
' @entity82 , prosecuting , told the court that police said all allegations against @entity10 had been investigated and there was no substance to any of them			2
he added : ' @entity20 was issued with a harassment notice in february 2013 and within a short space of time that was breached by putting the camera at her kitchen window directly pointing into @entity10 ’s garden , at whoever came to her front door			1
' that caused some distress , as you would imagine			0
' @entity101 , defending , told the court : ' the reason she set up a camcorder was that she got an email from the police advising her if she was concerned about the behaviour of her neighbour then she should film it			0
' it is n't appropriate to use this court to deal with a neighbours ' dispute			0
' but outside court , @entity114 said : ' people are given advice by the police to gather evidence of anti-social behaviour , but at no time has miss @entity1 ever been told by us to set up a camera and continuously film her neighbour 's private property			1
' in fact she was given warnings by the police to remove it			0
' with regards to making false and malicious allegations , not only can it cause a lot of distress , it is a criminal offence and we will pursue it			0
