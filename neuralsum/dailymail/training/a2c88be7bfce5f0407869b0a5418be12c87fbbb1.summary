@entity0 , 65 , was forced to spend nine hours in a ' cupboard ' at the @entity3 and @entity2 because of a bed crisis a pensioner was forced to spend all night in a storeroom at one of the country 's flagship hospitals because all the wards were full			1
@entity0 , 65 , was stunned when a porter told him he was being taken to a ' cupboard ' at the @entity3 and @entity2			1
having arrived with a serious infection , he claims he was repeatedly disturbed by staff going into the cramped room to get bandages , dressings and other kit			1
he said his ordeal was made worse when he had to endure 27 hours nil by mouth before he was taken to theatre for urgent surgery			2
mr @entity0 , who set up the national charity action on pain 16 years ago , said : ' this just is n't good enough			1
i 'd be embarrassed if i was in charge of this hospital			2
' his claims come just days after the @entity3 and @entity2 hosptial 's chief executive , @entity29 , admitted she would not want her mother treated there as staff are stretched to breaking point			1
@entity36 admissions at the hospital are almost 10 per cent higher this year compared to the same period last year , having shot up to 68,000 this year			1
the 953 - bed hospital opened in 2001 under the @entity40 scheme , costing Â£ 229m			1
it is one of the largest hospitals in the @entity44 in terms of in - patient capacity			0
ms @entity29 admitted that drastic bed shortages at the 13 - year - old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions			1
he said : ' i would n't choose this for my mum , but i would n't want her in the car park either			0
' i would want her in the hospital			2
it 's really tough for everybody			0
' we are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad			0
' our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors			0
' mr @entity0 , of @entity73 , near @entity74 , @entity3 , said he now plans to complain to the healthcare regulator , the @entity75 , about his ordeal			1
he had gone to the hospital on july 2 for a routine procedure , which was carried out as an outpatient appointment			2
but a few days later , he began feeling unwell and on the weekend of july 12 and 13 , he was referred by a gp to the hospital with a high temperature			1
he claims he spent four hours in the acute medical unit before being seen by a doctor , who set he had a serious infection and needed to be admitted			1
' at 2.30am a porter came through and said we were going to @entity89 ward and he said i was going in the cupboard			2
' in total , he spent five days at the hospital before being discharged			1
mr @entity0 said : ' they called it a treatment room , but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights he said : ' the treatment was fabulous , but this incident shows that things are going wrong			1
' the nurses on the ward were superb , but they were placed in an impossible situation			2
' the father - of - two said he was taken to the storeroom in a ward at about 2.30am on july 14			2
mr @entity0 claims he was forced to stay there until a bed on the ward finally became free at about 11am			1
he said : ' they called it a treatment room , but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights			2
' there was no privacy at all			0
the nurses were coming in quite often and were very apologetic , ' he said			0
' they had to move my bed at times to get to the supplies			2
the fact they gave me a complaints form when i arrived on the ward shows the situation is totally out of control			0
' a hospital spokesman said treatment rooms were used for extra bed space as ' escalation areas ' when hospital wards were full			2
the hospital 's chief executive , @entity29 , recently admitted she would n't want her own mother treated there late last month , @entity29 , chief executive of @entity3 and @entity2 spoke out as services reached breaking point due to a catastrophic rise in patients			1
ms @entity29 said drastic bed shortages at the 13 - year - old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions			1
the crisis is getting worse all the time because the rural region has a growing , ageing population and patients are staying in hospital longer			1
coupled with a rise in @entity36 admissions - which have rocketed from 54,000 in 2008 - 09 to 68,000 this year - exhausted staff are said to be under immense pressure			2
ms @entity29 , hospital chief executive since 2008 , admitted : ' i would n't choose this for my mum , but i would n't want her in the car park either			1
i would want her in the hospital			0
' it 's really tough for everybody			0
i do this job as i 'm proud of what we do and i love it			0
' we are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad			0
' our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors			0
' ms @entity29 said there were ' all sorts of options ' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953 - bed hospital			1
the huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school			0
the dialysis unit and clinical teaching spaces are also used when the hospital is full to capacity			0
in 2010 , pensioner @entity201 , 85 , had to spend a night in a storeroom at the @entity3 and @entity203			1
mr @entity0 added : ' this [ shows this ] has been going on for four and a half years			2
' i 'd have thought they 'd have come up with a solution in that period of time			0
' to put the blame entirely on outside factors is disingenuous and there is a lot you can do at the hospital , ' insisted mr @entity0			1
' four and a half years and they are still content to put someone in a cupboard or what they call a treatment room			0
' it is totally unacceptable and it is quite ridiculous			0
' the spokesman said : ' at the time that mr @entity0 came to hospital we were already fully occupied caring for other patients			1
' we do not , however , turn away patients who need emergency admission			0
' if necessary , when all our wards are full and more patients need our care , we implement an escalation plan and care for patients in what are known as escalation areas			0
@entity36 admissions at the hospital are almost 10 per cent higher this year compared to the same period last year , having shot up to 68,000 this year ' these are areas of the hospital that are not routinely used to accommodate patients but they allow us to safely care for all the patients needing our services			1
' mr @entity0 was moved to a treatment room for a few hours on @entity247 until we could provide a single bedded room on that ward			1
' he had access to a call bell and the nursing team were making regular checks on his welfare			0
' he added : ' our matron apologised to mr @entity0 at the time of his admission and we have met him since to explain the circumstances			2
' we are sorry that he remains unhappy			0
the hospital is extremely busy , with many elderly patients requiring our care			0
' our staff are working extremely hard to provide all our patients with the care , dignity and compassion that they deserve			0
' we are working with our partners across the healthcare system to try to find additional capacity , particularly to enable us to discharge some of those patients who no longer need the specialist facilities of the hospital			0
