space experts said the eery ring ( pictured ) is an artifact caused by the scattering of light inside the camera incredible new images of one of @entity5 ' moons rising in the sky have been taken by @entity4 's @entity3 based on the red planet			1
the exploration vehicle , which is fitted with a navigation camera , took 86 photos of @entity20 rising after sunset on 28 june			1
they were transformed into a video by @entity4 employees back on @entity25			2
while the video is just 32 seconds long , it shows the remarkable moonrise , which actually lasted 27 minutes			0
@entity4 experts at its @entity30 said the eery ring seen in the video is an artifact caused by the scattering of light inside the camera			2
@entity20 , the moon seen in the video , measures just 14 miles wide but @entity5 ' only other moon , @entity36 is even more diminutive			1
many astronomers believe that the two tiny moons are actually old asteroids snared by @entity5 ' gravity millions of years ago			0
the strange video of the @entity5 moonrise was shared on the @entity48 feed in a post that read : ' you asked for the moon			1
here it is ! see footage from my @entity54 of @entity5 ' moon @entity20 rising			0
' @entity4 's curiosity rover landed on @entity5 last august			1
it began its two - year tour to explore whether @entity5 ever supported microbial life , from the enormous @entity61			0
@entity4 scientists controlling the robotic vehicle reported in march that a site called @entity65 could have supported life billions of years ago			0
@entity20 , the moon seen in the video and pictured here , measures just 14 miles wide but @entity5 ' only other moon , @entity36 is even more diminutive			1
many astronomers believe that the two tiny moons are actually old asteroids snared by @entity5 ' gravity millions of years ago while the rover has stuck close to its landing site so far , it is now on its way to its final destination , @entity81			1
the strange mountain towers over the centre of @entity84 by almost three and a half miles			0
it is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet 's changing environment over time			0
the video is not the first observation of @entity20 made by the @entity3			2
it took a photograph of the mini moon as it crossed the sun just five weeks after landing on the red planet last year			0
@entity4 released the first official images captured by its @entity3 showing the surface of @entity5 in crystal clear detail last month			1
the space agency created a panorama made up of one billion pixels stitched together from nearly 900 exposures taken by cameras on - board @entity3			0
just days ago the @entity3 shared images of @entity110 near the @entity61 on @entity5			2
it is conducting experiments on the rocks ' distinctive layers			0

video of @entity2 is made from 86 photos taken in just under half an hour by the @entity3 on @entity5
the moon pictured measures just 14 miles across and is believed to be an old asteroid
@entity4 's curiosity rover is beginning its *mission* to climb @entity81
