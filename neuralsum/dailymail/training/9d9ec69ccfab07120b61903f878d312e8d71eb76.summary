it is the largest shark ever to have lived , weighing 50 tonnes and measuring 18 feet long			0
however , swimmers can breathe a sigh of relief - the megalodon really did become extinct 2.6 millions years ago			1
recently it was claimed the shark could still exist - forcing researchers into pinpointing its exact date of demise @entity11 , ( @entity13 megalodon ) a 50 tonne extinct species of shark which lived between the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
the maximum size of the @entity11 has been of much debate - cartilage rarely fossilises and therefore no complete shark has ever been found			1
however , it is believed they may have reached 18 feet long			0
however , near - complete sets of dentitions have been found , which allows for accurate reconstruction			1
the @entity11 's colossal mouth would have produced a but force of 10.8 to 18.2 tons			0
researchers from @entity29 and the @entity30 hope the study appearing online today in the journal @entity33 showing the species became extinct 2.6 million years ago will clarify public confusion			1
the study may also one day help scientists better understand the potential widespread effects of losing the planet 's top predators , said lead author @entity41			2
' i was drawn to the study of @entity11 's extinction because it is fundamental to know when species became extinct to then begin to understand the causes and consequences of such an event , ' said @entity41 , a doctoral candidate at the @entity50 on the @entity29 campus			1
' i also think people who are interested in this animal deserve to know what the scientific evidence shows , especially following @entity57 specials that implied megalodon may still be alive			1
' the study represents the first phase of @entity62 's ongoing reconstruction of megalodon 's extinction			2
as modern top predators , especially large sharks , are significantly declining worldwide due to the current biodiversity crisis , @entity41 said this study serves as the basis to better understand the consequences of these changes			2
' when you remove large sharks , then small sharks are very abundant and they consume more of the invertebrates that we humans eat , ' @entity41 said			0
' recent estimations show that large - bodied , shallow - water species of sharks are at greatest risk among marine animals , and the overall risk of shark extinction is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates			2
' a tooth of the prehistoric shark megalodon compared to the tooth of a great white shark			0
the @entity11 's colossal mouth would have produced a but force of 10.8 to 18.2 tons			0
@entity41 plans to further investigate possible correlations between changes in megalodon 's distribution and the evolutionary trends of marine mammals , such as whales and other sharks			0
' when we calculated the time of megalodon 's extinction , we noticed that the modern function and gigantic sizes of filter feeder whales became established around that time , ' @entity41 said			0
' future research will investigate if megalodon 's extinction played a part in the evolution of these new classes of whales			0
' the slowly unraveling details of megalodon 's extinction and various aspects of its natural history have consumed @entity41 's research for the past six years , including ongoing analysis of megalodon 's body size and a 2010 @entity33 study that proposed @entity121 served as a nursery habitat for the species			1
the maximum size of the @entity11 has been of much debate - cartilage rarely fossilises and therefore no complete shark has ever been found			2
for the new study , researchers used databases and scientific literature of the most recent megalodon records and calculated the extinction using a novel mathematical model proven reliable in recent experimental testing by study co-author @entity135 with the @entity136 at the @entity30 vertebrate paleontologist @entity137 with the @entity138 of @entity139 said the study will not only serve as a key reference for debunking the myth that megalodon still exists , but its novel methods will influence the future of scientific research of extinct animals and plants			1
' the methodology that the authors used had only been previously employed to determine extinction dates in historical times , such as to estimate the extinction date of the dodo bird , ' @entity148 said			0
' in this work , scientists applied that same methodology to determine the extinction of an organism millions of years ago , instead of hundreds			1
' it 's a new tool that paleo biologists did n't have , or rather had not thought of using before			0

follows @entity57 shows claiming animal could still be alive
study found species became extinct 2.6 million years ago
