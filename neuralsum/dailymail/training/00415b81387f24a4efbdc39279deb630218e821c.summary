illustration by @entity7 pictured the @entity8 may have wiped out millions of people , but it also made the surviving residents of @entity11 healthier			2
researchers studying the skeletons of 14th century @entity3 found life expectancy improved in the generations following the great plague			1
and this may have been because the disease wiped out the weak and elderly , leaving only the strongest members of the population			0
previous studies have shown the @entity8 targeted elderly adults and the sick across @entity23 from around 1347 to 1351			0
however , not much is known about any substantial changes in the population , such as overall health and mortality , before and after the epidemic			2
doctor @entity29 , of the @entity30 , examined whether the deaths of frail people during the @entity8 , combined with consequent rising standards of living - particularly in diet - may have resulted in a healthier post-epidemic population in @entity11			2
most available information is in historical documentation , such as tax records and post-mortem analysis , but for the new study dr @entity29 sampled nearly 600 skeletons from several pre and post-plague @entity11 cemeteries			1
she then analysed their age and modelled age estimates , mortality hazards , and birth rate data for the samples			0
the post-black death samples had a higher proportion of older adults , suggesting that survival may have improved following the epidemic			1
a total of 600 skeletons from @entity11 cemeteries were analysed			1
researchers used the bones to model age estimates and mortality risks			1
the post-plague samples had a higher proportion of older adults , suggesting survival improved after the epidemic			1
stock image of skeletons found with signs of the plague pictured the @entity8 is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across @entity23 from 1347 to 1351			0
recent analysis of dna from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the yersinia pestis bacterium			0
it is believed to have originated in central @entity78 , before reaching the @entity79 by 1346			0
rats are thought to have carried infected fleas on merchant ships throughout the @entity83 and @entity23			0
research suggests it took 150 years for @entity23 's population to recover from the effects of the plague			0
and results of hazards analysis - published in the journal @entity92 - indicate that , overall , mortality risks were lower in the post-black death population than before the epidemic			1
‘ together , these results may indicate enhanced survival and decreased mortality after the @entity8 , and by inference , improved health in some age groups in the post-epidemic population , ’ said dr @entity29			1
although other factors could have influenced the differences , including the migration of people to @entity11 after the plague , dr @entity29 suggests the study highlights the power infectious diseases have in shaping the population			2
this includes the health and demography , over both the short and long - term			0
she added : ‘ this study suggests that even in the face of major threats to health , such as repeated plague outbreaks , several generations of people who lived after the @entity8 were healthier in general than people who lived before the epidemic			0

researchers sampled 600 skeletons taken from @entity11 cemeteries
they estimated the ages of the deceased before modelling mortality risks
@entity135 samples had a higher proportion of older adults
this suggests survival rates may have improved following the epidemic
analysis also found mortality risks were lower in post-plague populations
