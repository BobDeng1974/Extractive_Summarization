sir @entity0 complained that visitors are now not engaging with the nation 's treasures and instead walking around ' on autocue ' next time you make a beeline for the audio guides at a museum , it might be an idea to think again			1
according to one of @entity14 's most respected curators , taped commentaries are ruining the nation 's exhibitions and turning visitors into ' zombies '			1
sir @entity0 complained yesterday that visitors are now not engaging with the nation 's treasures and instead walking around ' on autocue '			1
the 79 - year - old said audio guides tended to ' go on ' too long , leading people to blindly stand in front of paintings or exhibits for hours			1
sir @entity0 , former director of the @entity28 and the @entity29 , said he now feared people were beginning to prefer audio - guides to the actual artworks			1
he said : ' with these sound guides , there 's a tendency to tell you too much and to go on too much			2
' often , some of these gallery guides go on and on and on			2
and you see people on autocue going around like zombies			2
' it 's good if the person can have their own discovery			0
' sir @entity0 made his outspoken criticism at the @entity47 , where he was speaking about @entity48			1
the garden , in @entity49 , is the largest private formal garden to be created in @entity51 since 1945 and was a 30 - year labour of love for sir @entity0 and his late wife @entity54			1
he was quick to point out that visitors to the @entity56 receive only scant information about each section			0
but recalling one mosaic exhibition he saw recently , he joked that he urged one visitor to stop listening to the guide , saying : ' look at the mosaic , woman , not her ! ' he also remembered becoming exasperated when observing another museum visitors ' group looking at an @entity67 version of @entity68 's 1642 painting @entity69 when they were stood in front of the real thing			2
the 79 - year - old said audio guides tended to ' go on ' too long , leading people to blindly stand in front of paintings or exhibits for hours he said : ' they 'd rather watch the @entity69 on tv than see the real picture			1
' sir @entity0 , whose wife @entity80 died in 2003 from pancreatic cancer , lives in the village of @entity83 , which lies 8 miles south of @entity84			1
it was here that the pair created their garden , which is full of references to their romance of three decades			0
he said that after her death , he tried to clear out some of her plant collections , including her 130 varieties of crab apple trees			0
his head gardener ended up planting them around @entity84 at bus stops and other random locations , which , he said , ' she would have liked			0
' he added : ' [ the garden ] has been edited down from what it was			0
it was much more confused before			0
' on his gardening philosophy , he said : ' i never mind breaking the rules			0
it accounts for a lot of my success			0
never take any notice of whatever anyone else says			0
