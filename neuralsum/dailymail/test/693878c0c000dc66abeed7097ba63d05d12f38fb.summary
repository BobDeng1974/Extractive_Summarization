@entity0 believes neutral territory offers @entity3 hope of toppling mighty @entity4 to reach a second successive @entity6 final			1
@entity7 landed a long - range penalty in the final act of sunday 's showdown with @entity11 to clinch a 12 - 11 victory that has set up a last - four trip to @entity15 's @entity14 on april 18			1
awaiting in the @entity17 semi-finals are @entity4 , who are bristling with confidence after their remarkable 37 - 5 rout of runaway @entity22 leaders @entity23			1
@entity7 launches a long range penalty towards the posts with the final act of @entity3 ' quarter - final the @entity29 centre is then mobbed by his team - mates after landing the match - winning kick however , @entity0 believes that facing @entity4 outside of their @entity36 - @entity35 stronghold , where they have not lost in @entity6 since 2008 , is a different proposition			1
' given @entity4 's home record , it 's bit of a relief to be playing them on neutral territory			1
we 're still going to @entity43 , but it 's not quite the same as going to their own ground , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity3 ' prospects against the @entity50 's second - placed team are likely to be improved by the return of centre @entity52 from an ankle injury , while there is an outside chance fly - half @entity57 could recover from his knee problem in time			2
' we have some pretty tough fixtures coming up - @entity61 next saturday is a massive game for us and after @entity4 we have @entity23 in the @entity22 , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have some players coming back and will have to spread the load during this period			0
@entity52 should be back for the @entity17 semi-final , @entity57 is touch and go			1
' @entity23 's players look shell - shocked after they were demolished by @entity4 @entity3 hardly sent shockwaves across the continent after dispatching @entity11 in an arm wrestle decided by @entity7 's nerveless penalty , but @entity0 insists the result is all that matters			1
' sometimes the games are the way they are and we must n't over analyse these things , ' @entity0 said			0
' we 've come away to @entity43 and played a big , strong , very good team with outstanding half - backs , but we 've won			2
' we should n't worry too much about how we won , but just that we won and reached our third consecutive semi-final in this tough competition			0
that says a lot about the players we have			0
' when you look at @entity87 at @entity88 and @entity89 at @entity90 , they lost quarters and semis over the years before they started winning them			0
@entity0 watches on as @entity94 warms up before sunday 's dramatic @entity6 win ' we lost the quarter to @entity4 four years ago and the semis to @entity97 two years ago , and you saw out there that @entity11 did n't really know how to win the game			1
' they had this big strong wind they did n't use because of the pressure they were under , and that was down to our team			0
' @entity11 's @entity107 expects to end speculation over his future this week with the @entity110 centre likely to sign a dual contract in @entity112			2
' hopefully it will be sorted this week			0
i do n't want to say anything until it 's sorted , ' @entity107 said .			0
