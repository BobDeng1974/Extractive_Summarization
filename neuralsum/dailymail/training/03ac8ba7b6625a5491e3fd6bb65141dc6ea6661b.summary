by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 30 september 2013 @entity1 has fallen short of the best countries in the world in an international league table measuring the wellbeing of the elderly			1
it ranked the @entity1 13th – one place below @entity9 – for the levels of income , health and employment of older people			2
the table , drawn up by academics for the charity @entity17 , showed the top three were @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
while @entity1 is not one of the very best countries in which to grow old , however , the elderly here fare better than in some parts of @entity27			2
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 are all listed outside the top 20 , below poorer nations such as @entity32 and @entity33			1
@entity34 is placed only 18th			0
@entity35 , an @entity37 member for more than 15 years , is ranked at 62 , below @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41			0
@entity17 , which is based in @entity42 but operates mainly in developing countries , commissioned academics from several universities to compile the @entity46 , the first of its kind			0
they considered measures including pensions , poverty rates , life expectancy , levels of employment and education , and whether old people are physically safe and have friends			0
@entity1 ’s 13th place is based on a good ranking for pensions and benefits such as pension credit			1
however , the report suggests that healthcare for the elderly in the @entity1 is not up to the best standards			1
it points to life - expectancy estimates that show babies born here now can expect four years less life than might be expected			0
it also shows that those who make it to the age of 60 in @entity75 can expect to live to 86 – three years longer than in @entity1			2
the three lowest - ranked countries of the 91 that could provide enough data about the welfare of their elderly population were @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
standards : the survey said the elderly @entity1 had good pensions and benefits but the levels of healthcare could be improved ( file picture )			1

@entity1 fell behind @entity19 and @entity21 in @entity92
position is based on a good ranking for pensions and benefits
but report suggests healthcare is not up to the best standards
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 failed to make top 20
