by @entity0 people who make more than 15 hours of mobile telephone calls a month are three times as likely to develop brain cancer , new research suggests			1
@entity7 scientists claims that sales and business professionals are particularly at risk as they travel from meeting to meeting while communicating with clients and bosses constantly			2
while most people average around two - and - a - half hours each month talking on their mobiles , busy executives can quickly reach far higher figures			2
those who clock up around 900 hours of mobile use during the course of their career are particularly prone to developing a brain tumour			1
a study carried out at the @entity25 in @entity7 has found those who spend more than 15 hours a month on their mobile phones are three times more likely to develop a brain tumour during the course of their life the researchers drew their conclusions from a study of 253 cases of glioma and 194 cases of meningioma reported in four @entity7 departments between 2004 and 2006			1
patients were matched against 892 healthy individuals drawn from the general population , in a bid to spot any differences between the two groups			0
the comparison found a risk among those who used their phone intensively which was three times higher than those who use it far less			0
the duration of use in the at risk category ranged from between two and 10 years , averaging at five years			0
the @entity25 research , which is published in the @entity59 journal , is the latest possible evidence of the dangers of too much mobile phone use			2
it led to @entity64 , a @entity7 pressure group , to call for tougher rules regulating electromagnetic waves			1
@entity68 , the group 's president , told @entity71 newspaper : ' how much proof is needed before we launch real protective measures for the population , notably for children who start using mobiles from the age of 13 ? ' the study , which was carried out at the @entity25 ( pictured ) found those who use their phones for more than 900 hours over the course of their careers were ' particularly prone ' to developing a brain tumour the @entity87 's @entity86 has classed electromagnetic waves , including the type emitted by mobile phones , as ' possible carcinogens			1
' but @entity92 , of the @entity94 institute which carried out the research , said : ' there is no reason to panic			0
this does not mean that everyone who makes a call with a mobile phone is going to get a brain tumour			1
' the study itself reads : ' it is difficult to define a level of risk , if any , especially as mobile phone technology is constantly evolving , " the study acknowledged			0
' the rapid evolution of technology has led to a considerable increase in the use of mobile phones and a parallel decrease of [ radiowave intensity ] emitted by the phones			0
' studies taking account of these recent developments and allowing the observation of potential long - term effects will be needed			0
