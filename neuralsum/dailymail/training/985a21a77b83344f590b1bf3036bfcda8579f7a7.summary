by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 21:54 est , 22 july 2013 from levies on cabin baggage to billing for printed boarding passes , it seems there 's little that budget airlines wo n't charge for			0
now a new survey has revealed that airlines are charging up to seven times more for food and drink than your local supermarket			1
among the overpriced products highlighted were a 330ml bottle of water that cost 22p in a supermarket but £ 1.80 on a @entity21 aircraft while a bar of chocolate priced at 25p on the high street totted up to £ 1.20 on an @entity26 flight			2
@entity27 cost : budget airlines such as @entity31 charge up to seven times more for food than supermarkets the research , which was carried out by money - saving website @entity37 and published in the @entity38 , compared airline prices to those in a typical branch of @entity42			1
on average , the survey discovered that food and drink were at least 241 per cent higher in the air			2
@entity46 , of @entity47 , said : ' passengers travelling away this summer can easily get caught out by inflated prices for food and drinks , simply by failing to plan ahead			0
' airlines can get away with charging whatever they want for simple items such as a can of your favourite soft drink or a bar of chocolate as customers have no other option once on board the aircraft			2
' for those families who have worked hard for their annual getaway , these marked up prices are both unwelcome and unnecessary			0
picking up a few snacks before departing for the airport or even in the airport itself can save holidaymakers significant amounts			0
' along with @entity21 and @entity26 , @entity31 was another airline singled out for its price hikes which included charging £ 1.74 for a 38p can of @entity75 and £ 1.74 for a stick of pepperami that would cost 50p at @entity42			1
price hike : this 38p can of @entity75 cost £ 1.74 on @entity31 while a £ 1 bag of @entity81 totted up to £ 2.75 on @entity82 @entity84 chocolate bar : 33p in store but £ 1.30 on @entity86 @entity88 chocolate bar : 25p in store but £ 1.20 on @entity26 @entity90 ( 160g bag ) : £ 1 in store but £ 2.75 on @entity82 @entity93 ( 25g stick ) : 50p in store but £ 1.74 on @entity31 @entity96 ( 330ml can ) : 30p in store but £ 1.60 on @entity98 @entity99 ( 250ml can ) : 67p in store but £ 2.50 on @entity101 @entity102 ( 330ml can ) : 30p in store but £ 1.60 on @entity104 other offenders include @entity98 , which charges £ 1.60 for a 30p can of @entity96 , @entity82 , which prices a packet of @entity90 at £ 2.75 compared with @entity42 's £ 1 , and @entity86 which hiked the price of a @entity84 from 33p to £ 1.30 - a difference of 294 per cent			1
also in the firing line was @entity101 , which charges £ 2.50 for a 67p can of @entity99 , and @entity104 which upped the cost of a can of @entity102 from 30p to £ 1.60 - an eye - watering 433 per cent hike			1
asked to comment , a @entity31 spokesman said : ' @entity31 delivers @entity121 ’s guaranteed lowest fares and a range of affordable , top quality inflight food , drinks and snacks on our @entity128 menu			1
' passengers are free to bring their own snacks on board if they wish			1
' @entity21 , meanwhile , argued that price hikes were the result of catering costs - allegedly much higher in the air			0
' we always endeavour to deliver a quality experience , from the moment people start their holidays with us			0
this includes the catering in - flight where we provide hot food and healthy snacks			0
' our products are sourced from a variety of different suppliers , as are those from other airlines			0
the costs for supplying an aircraft are far higher than for a supermarket or restaurant and as such we believe this is a very difficult comparison to make			0
it ’s not like for like			0
' @entity26 , however , said that prices should be compared to those in restaurants but not in supermarkets			1
in a statement , the airline said : ' our prices should be compared with bars and restaurants rather than supermarkets			1
' a supermarket operation will have huge economies of scale , lower cost prices along with lower supply chain and operating costs , is therefore not comparable to the service offering and specialised loading requirements of an airline environment			2

prices are hiked by as much as 433 *%* , according to a new survey
typical *examples* include charging £ 1.60p for a 30p can of coke
costs were compared to identical products sold in supermarkets
@entity31 says customers are ' free to bring their own snacks ' if they wish
