by @entity0 last updated at 4:52 pm on 5th october 2011 prince @entity1 will fire a live missile for the first time when he arrives in the @entity4 this week to take part in an intense eight - week training programme in one of the world 's most awesome fighting machines			1
the 27 - year - old royal will take the controls of an @entity13 helicopter in a mega-shooting range at @entity15 in @entity16 in the @entity18 desert			1
he is already qualified to fly the aircraft after passing earlier this year but in order for him to be ' battle ready ' he now has to complete a ' conversion to @entity23 ' course and could face battle as early as next year			2
one road town : prince @entity1 will attend training at an air force base just outside the tiny desert community of @entity15 , @entity29 , next month tough training : the prince in front of an @entity13 helicopter earlier this year			1
he will stay at @entity15 as part of a 12 - week @entity36 @entity13 course a spokesman for @entity38 said : ' the training in the @entity4 will consist of environmental training , live firing and tactical exercises			1
' prince @entity1 will be in for a shock when he arrives at @entity15			1
it is a dusty one - road town that boasts a population of just 1,700 and ' five old crabs ' - and has just one bar			2
after two lavish summer holidays - in @entity49 , @entity50 , and at a luxury villa in @entity53 's forthcoming trip promises to be slightly more demanding			2
he will stay at the remote location as part of a 12 - week @entity36 @entity58 training course , following a short time in @entity59 , @entity18 , where he will arrive in the first week of october			1
@entity15 has been chosen by military chiefs because its environment is similar to @entity62			1
the @entity63 is basic with just one runway , an air - traffic control tower , a few tents and a couple of building and is surrounded by giant cacti			2
facilities are so sparse that most @entity36 pilots visiting on the course - exercise crimson eagle - stay in the adjacent town			2
while @entity1 is used to staying aboard yachts and in some of the world 's most luxurious hotels , @entity15 's top lodgings costs just £ 60 per night			1
the @entity78 - has bizarrely been designed to look like a space ship			2
all there is : bartender @entity81 works at @entity82 , the only nightlife option in @entity15 two horse town ? local cowboy @entity85 has n't even heard of @entity1 ' @entity86 ' during his stay in @entity50 last month , @entity1 was photographed jumping fully - clothed into a swimming pool surrounded by fellow party - goers dancing to thumping music			1
but @entity15 has only one small pool at the quirky @entity92			1
a receptionist said : ' visitors who are not staying at the hotel can use the pool for $ 2.50 ( £ 1.60 )			0
@entity1 will be welcome to come if he wants			0
' and it seems @entity1 , who is used to being recognised wherever he goes , might get a different reception in @entity15 , where many residents are clueless as to his identity			1
local cowboy @entity85 , 49 , said : ' i have no idea who prince @entity86 is			0
i 've never heard of him			0
' he joked : " the girls are going to go crazy if there 's a prince coming here			0
' the town is very small			0
they built a freeway around it a few years back and it killed the town			0
now people just drive around it when they used to go through it and stop off			0
' barren : a rusty bridge just outside @entity15 , the area has been chosen because if its similarities to the conditions in @entity62 should the single prince be looking for an @entity4 bride in @entity15 , then it seems his options will also be limited			1
@entity81 , 45 , the bartender at @entity15 's only bar , @entity82 , said : ' there 's nothing really here so most of the young women move away as soon as they can			1
' the women here are usually a bit older and already married			0
most of the people who live here are retired			0
' sometimes the @entity135 pilots come in here and play pool or have a beer			0
' we occasionally have karaoke and live music here and that 's when the few girls of the town come in			0
' if we put on a karaoke night here that 'll be his only chance of meeting any of them			0
' at ease : fellow clubbers take their cue from prince @entity1 as he strutted his stuff barefoot on the side of an swimming pool at a @entity50 nightspot last month soaked : the prince was having such a good time he jumped into the pool at the @entity161 nightclub local tourist sights are also limited - a small , one - room museum displays old @entity165 antiques found in the area			1
day - trips include the @entity168 - an historic hiking path @entity170 moving to the @entity171 once used			0
nearby are some native @entity4 rock carvings created by old tribes who lived in the area			0
@entity1 could also head down to the @entity176 - a national park forest of huge cacti			0
the course at @entity15 is the culmination of @entity1 's training in flying @entity13 helicopter gunships , which he has been doing back home at @entity184 in @entity185			1
following the @entity4 leg of his training , @entity1 - known as captain @entity188 in the @entity190 - will return to @entity135 where he take part in final exercises before any possible deployment .			2

the 27 - year - old royal will arrive at @entity15 for military training this week
area chosen because it is similar to the harsh conditions in @entity62
