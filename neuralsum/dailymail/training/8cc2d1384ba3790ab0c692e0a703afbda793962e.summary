a tooth from a @entity3 proves the creatures were active hunters that engaged in predatory behaviour instead of scavenging for carcasses , @entity1 scientists have said			1
the four centimetre - long tooth was left embedded in the tail of plant - eating hadrosaur			1
some 65 million years later , scientists discovered it stuck between two of the @entity15 's fossilised vertebrae			1
scientists from the @entity17 ( pictured ) have discovered a @entity3 tooth embedded in the tail of a plant - eating @entity15 , which they claim proves that the fearsome dinosaur was an active predator and not a scavenger healed bone had grown around the tooth , fusing the vertebrae together , indicating the creature had a lucky escape			1
the @entity15 may have lived for months or even years after almost becoming a @entity3 meal			1
more importantly for dinosaur experts , the tooth provides strong evidence that the @entity3 was actively pursuing living prey			2
opinion is still divided over the dining habits of the fearsome meat - eater , which sported pointed , bone - crunching teeth up to nine inches long			0
in films such as @entity40 , the @entity3 is portrayed as a terrifying , merciless hunter			0
but some scientists believe in reality it mainly fed on the carcasses of already dead animals and had more in common with hyenas than lions			0
however , the new discovery from a rock formation known as @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity1 , does not conjure up a picture of a lazy scavenger			1
it suggests the @entity15 was fleeing for its life when the young @entity3 's jaws snapped on its tail			1
the four centimetre - long tooth ( pointed out using a pencil ) was left embedded in the tail of plant - eating hadrosaur			1
two fused fossilised vertebrae are pictured			0
the @entity67 's healed bone had grown around the tooth , indicating the creature had a lucky escape a @entity1 team led by dr @entity72 , from the @entity17 , wrote in the journal @entity73 : ' the fused vertebrae and embedded tooth are the result of an attack on a live hadrosaur , not the scavenging of a carcass , and represent unequivocal evidence of a predator - prey relationship			1
' we now have conclusive evidence that @entity3 indeed engaged in predatory behaviour			0
' whereas previously cited fossil evidence , such as isolated tooth marks , might have been easily misconstrued as the result of scavenging behaviour ... our specimen includes the identities of the prey animal and the attacker , and the fact that the prey was alive when attacked			0
' moreover , the position of the injury - the tail - suggests that @entity3 could possibly have engaged in pursuit predation			1
' the scientists pointed out that the position of the tooth was consistent with present - day pursuit attacks by predators			2
for example , @entity107 lions had been observed initially targeting the hindquarters of a prey animal in order to immobilise it			0
' this hadrosaur escaped and began to heal around the tooth lodged in its caudal vertebrae , providing evidence of the attack and the identity of the attacker , ' the researchers added			0
the scientists believe that they have ' conclusive evidence ' that @entity3 indeed engaged in predatory behaviour			2
whereas fossils of tooth marks might have been misconstrued as the result of scavenging behaviour , the new fossil shows the identities of the prey animal and the attacker			0
an artist 's impression of young @entity3 is pictured ' such evidence is rare in the fossil record for good reason - prey rarely escapes			2
' it was possible that many @entity3 bite marks found on other fossils were not associated with bone healing because the prey had been killed , they said			0
the fact that the @entity15 got away did not necessarily mean @entity3 was a poor predator , the scientists argued			1
between 45 per cent and 62 per cent of attacks by modern predators such as coyotes and lions end in failure or were aborted , but they are still viewed as efficient killers			2
the tooth is 3.75 centimetres long and 2.35 centimetres wide at the base and had been broken off at the root			0
it is identical in size and shape to teeth from @entity3 " sub-adults " housed in museums			0
comparisons with teeth from two other predators strongly suggested the tooth was from @entity3 and not some other dinosaur .			2

scientists from the @entity17 have discovered a @entity3 tooth embedded in the tail of a plant - eating @entity15
they claim their discovery proves the @entity3 was not a mere scavenger
the fossil , found in @entity51 , @entity52 , suggests that @entity3 chased the *herbivore* in a bid for a meal in a *similar* way to modern predators
