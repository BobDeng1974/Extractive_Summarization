he is a magnet for drama , is n’t he ? life with @entity4 is never dull and so it proved again			1
there is a reason it is always him			0
a coolly dispatched 84th - minute penalty gives @entity11 a slender advantage to protect in @entity13 but that only tells a fragment of the story of how this most mercurial of strikers delivered for @entity19 when it mattered most			1
when @entity22 was bundled over by @entity23 , @entity21 seemed certain to take the captain ’s role and assume responsibility for the spot - kick			1
@entity28 also wanted to take it			2
but then up popped @entity4 , who took the ball off @entity21 and put it on the spot			1
@entity11 striker @entity4 struck a late penalty as the @entity33 beat @entity34 1 - 0 in the @entity35 @entity4 stuttered in his run up and buried the ball bottom left as @entity34 ' goalkeeper looked on helplessly @entity4 took the ball off @entity11 captain @entity21 and fellow striker @entity28 to take the penalty @entity4 celebrates in front of the @entity11 fans after converting from the spot to give his side a narrow victory @entity11 : @entity46 , can , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity22 , @entity21 , @entity49 ( @entity50 63 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 77 ) , @entity28 , @entity54 ( @entity4 63 ) subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 booked : @entity50 goals : @entity61 ' ( pen ) @entity34 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity23 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 60 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 72 ) , @entity74 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 booked : @entity66 , @entity64 , @entity23 , @entity65 referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) from the scenes that followed , that decision was anything but popular			1
but as some squabbled and manager @entity19 looked on stone - faced , @entity4 barely flickered			2
he simply tapped @entity21 on the arm , told him he was fine and then casual sent @entity89 the wrong way			2
this was his third big contribution in a week , following on from a goal against @entity93 and a free - kick that led to @entity52 ’s winner at @entity96 , and how it was needed			2
this tie , as @entity34 manager @entity98 noted , is far from over and another test of character awaits in @entity13			2
finally , however , @entity11 are winning again in @entity102			0
@entity19 message before this contest was a hope and desire that they would play with verve and dash and show @entity102 a glimpse of the dynamic brand that almost carried them to the title			0
the @entity113 campaign , after all , had been a washout			0
@entity11 ’s performances in those six games with @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 were miserable and never threatened to take them to the latter stages			0
having won their opening contest in september with a late penalty , @entity11 then lurched from bad to worse and did not win any of their remaining five fixtures			1
a failure to beat @entity34 , then , would have seen them set an unwanted club record of most games without a victory in @entity102			0
in the first attack , you could see the difference between the @entity11 of then and now as a slick move , which involved @entity49 and @entity22 , ended with @entity28 hoodwinking @entity66 with a deft back heel but goalkeeper @entity63 parried his shot			1
stood in his technical area , @entity19 acknowledged the passage of passing with a thumbs up but the period of domination he might have expected to follow did not arrive , as @entity34 showed themselves to be obdurate @entity142 frustrated @entity93 at @entity143 in this competition last october and it was easy to see why they have been so proficient , as they worked relentlessly and had menace on the break			2
@entity34 striker @entity74 attempts a trick in the air while @entity11 players @entity152 ( right ) and @entity49 watch on @entity11 manager @entity19 crouches as he watches on from the sidelines at @entity154 during the first half @entity11 's @entity47 brings down @entity34 ' @entity68 during the @entity35 clash they almost took the lead in the 32nd minute when , from @entity70 ’s corner , @entity68 wriggled free of @entity152 but his header lacked the direction to bother @entity46 and it whistled over the bar			1
in the next attack , memories of how the @entity164 crown slipped away in april were evoked as @entity74 was sent scuttling through towards @entity166			0
we had been here before , former @entity168 striker @entity74 with the ball at his feet , defenders trying to catch up with him but this time @entity46 was equal to the task			1
that jolted a response from @entity11 and , as some hefty tackles were traded , they finished an intriguing first 45 minutes on the front foot , with first the impressive @entity51 , from fully 35 yards , and then @entity177			0
when @entity34 were last at @entity154 in november 2007 , they saw a 2 - 0 interval deficit become an 8 - 0 full - time mauling and the way @entity11 started the second period suggested they were in the mood to do something similar			1
they really should have broken the deadlock in the 48th minute			0
@entity34 striker @entity74 has a shot in goal during the first half which is saved by the @entity11 goalkeeper @entity34 forward @entity74 bites his gloves as rues a missed chance against @entity11 during the first half @entity11 captain @entity192 in the @entity194 studio alongside @entity195 ( centre ) and @entity197 ( right ) @entity34 ' @entity67 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity11 's @entity52 ( left ) @entity34 manager @entity98 watches on from the sidelines at @entity154 during the @entity35 clash @entity11 midfielder @entity52 ( centre ) watches his effort go wide as @entity28 ( right ) watches on @entity21 , once again a figure of perpetual motion in the heart of @entity11 ’s midfield , scampered down the right flank and managed to fire in a cross that caused all sorts of confusion between @entity63 , @entity34 second choice keeper , and defender @entity65			1
comically colliding together , they succeeded to present @entity52 with a glorious chance but the @entity215 international lost his composure and carelessly hoisted the opening above the bar			0
not long after , @entity19 took decisive action			0
@entity220 came @entity49 and @entity54 and they were replaced by @entity50 and @entity4 , allowing can to move into midfield alongside @entity21 and keep @entity11 pressing up the pitch			1
eventually the move reaped dividends			0
whether @entity4 was given hearty support in the dressing room is open to debate but that should not matter			0
winning is all that counts			0
@entity52 was substituted for @entity11 team - mate @entity53 as the @entity33 pushed forward looking for a goal @entity11 winger @entity22 was fouled in the area to win a late penalty for the home side @entity4 ( right ) celebrates with can after he scored his penalty to give @entity11 the victory			1

@entity4 scores late penalty for @entity11 as they *overcome* @entity34 in @entity35 first leg
winger @entity22 was fouled in the area before striker @entity4 *stepped* up to convert from the spot
the @entity245 grabbed the ball from captain @entity21 and rowed with @entity28
earlier @entity74 and @entity52 had missed *excellent* chances for both sides at @entity154
@entity11 take narrow lead to the second leg of the last - 32 clash in @entity255 next *thursday*
