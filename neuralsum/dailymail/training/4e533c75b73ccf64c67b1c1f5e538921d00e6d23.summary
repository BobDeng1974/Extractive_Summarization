by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 07:19 est , 9 november 2012 a mother has warned of the dangers of keeping @entity3 after her two - year - old daughter was mauled when their ' good family dog ' turned on her ' out of nowhere '			1
the animal has been put down following the attack on @entity9			1
her mother @entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , is warning other parents about the dangers of @entity3 around young children			1
bloodied : two - year - old @entity9 was left with several injuries afte being savaged by the pet			1
her mother is now warning of the dangers of keeping @entity3 around young children ' she was only playing in the kitchen , then when she walked past the dog , out of nowhere , it went for her face			1
' the dog managed to take the skin off of the youngster ’s eyebrow , as well as pierce two holes underneath one of her eyes , the bridge of her nose and by the side of her mouth , with its teeth			2
' what is even more terrifying is that it could have been a whole lot worse than this ! ' said @entity10			2
the @entity41 belonged to @entity10 ’s boyfriend 's mother and was put down following the incident			1
' people , parents especially , need to be made aware that these dogs around young children can be really dangerous			0
' it ’s an absolutely awful thing to see your child go through and i would not wish it on anyone , that ’s why i want to warn parents to keep these dogs away from their children because they are really nasty dogs			0
( file picture ) the @entity41 belonged to @entity59 s boyfriend 's mother and was put down following the incident ' the picture really says all that i could possibly say , i want people to see what these dogs can do , ' she said			2
prior to the attack , @entity10 , said she had no real concerns about the dog called @entity68			1
' it had gone for other dogs in the past but never children or other people , for that matter			2
@entity9 had been around the dog before , i ’d never had any reason to worry about her with the dog until that occasion			1
' the advert for the rescue dog of six months described it as ' a good family dog , that was good with pets and good with children			0
' ' none of that was true , there were no warning signs , it ’s terrifying , ' said @entity10			2
the @entity41 owes its origins by cross breeding 60 per cent of the @entity88 and 40 per cent of the @entity89 in @entity90 during the 1800s			0
it was originally used to protect animal farms from thieves and primarily used as watchdogs that raised an alarm to any intrusion			0
the breed is large , with a powerful bodyframe , but it is also an intelligent and agile dog , which makes it an excellent watchdog			0
however , @entity3 are aggressive when provoked and strong enough to catch hold of an man , pin him down to the floor and hold him there for long periods of time			0
trainers say a firm , although not harsh , approach is needed to discipline them properly , or else things may get out of control			0
they also say this dog breed must be taught to socialise at an early age , as it can become aggressive towards other dogs and strangers .			0

mother of @entity9 , @entity10 , was left horrified
she said : ' she was only playing in the kitchen , then when she walked past the dog , out of nowhere , it went for her face . '
