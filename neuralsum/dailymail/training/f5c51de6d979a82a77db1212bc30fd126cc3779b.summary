it used to be that ending a relationship was between two people , and two people alone ; now there are the opinions of others to consider , as well as the post-break - up feelings of your ex when he reads about what you 're doing online ... and it 's all down to wretched social media			2
a particular debt of ' gratitude ' is owed , of course , to @entity22			0
as a result , having a ' social media cleanse ' when a relationship crumbles into dust is increasingly common , with 42 per cent of people ' unfriending ' their ex on @entity22 or unfollowing them on @entity30 before they 've been broken up for a month , and 34 per cent deleting all online images of their former love , according to research			1
@entity22 ex-iquette has made modern dating and breaking up a minefield of problems having a ' social media cleanse ' when a relationship crumbles into dust is increasingly common , with 42 per cent of people ' unfriending ' their ex on @entity22 or unfollowing them on @entity30 before they 've been broken up for a month furthermore , almost a third ( 31 per cent ) would extend the cull and remove all contact with their ex-partner 's friends and family as well			1
dramatically , one in three ( 34 per cent ) of 18 to 34 - year - olds consider it acceptable for break - up cleanses to also involve deleting all photographs which feature their ex-partner ; effectively removing the relationship 's digital footprint and rewriting their personal social media history			1
the survey of over 2,000 @entity58 people makes up part of @entity61 's @entity58 social - ology study 2013 into on how our personal lives are played out in our social media activity			2
the research also revealed that social media is a stage upon which the broken - hearten can publicly announce that they have moved on			0
the survey of over 2,000 @entity58 people makes up part of @entity61 's @entity58 social - ology study 2013 into on how our personal lives are played out in our social media activity it used to be that ending a relationship was between two people , and two people alone ; now there are the opinions of others to consider , as well as the post-break - up feelings of your ex. ... two in three ( 65 per cent ) deem it acceptable to flaunt their new unattached status by changing their @entity22 profile to ' single ' within the first month of a break - up , while one in five ( 18 per cent ) would happily change their @entity22 status to ' in a relationship ' with someone new within the first month			1
similarly , nearly a third ( 30 per cent ) say that it 's ok to upload and tag pictures with a new love interest within the first month of a break - up			0
but this pubic display of moving on goes both ways : nearly a fifth ( 17 per cent ) think it acceptable to ' stalk ' an ex-partner 's social media channels for evidence they are with someone new			2
modern break - ups are , it would appear , a lot more complicated than those of past generations psychologist and behavioural expert , professor @entity107 , of @entity108 determined that : ' these findings confirm what many psychologists have suspected about those who have grown up surrounded by social media - that they fall in " digital love " quickly ( that is , to provide on - line confirmation and validation of a new relationship ) but are just as capable of falling out of it quickly too , and with some clinical precision			1
' when new romances form , the digital confirmation ( e.g. @entity22 status ) is often viewed as the confirmation of the new relationship that makes it both real and public			0
' it makes sense then that this method is also used as a decisive means of confirming to the world the end of a romance			0

having a ' social media cleanse ' is increasingly common after a break - up
and 17 *%* of people think it 's ok to ' stalk ' ex on @entity22
