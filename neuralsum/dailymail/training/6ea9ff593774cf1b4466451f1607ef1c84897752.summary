@entity1 is trying to ' bribe ' @entity3 voters with a ' vindictive ' mansion tax raid on @entity5 to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border , @entity0 claimed today			1
the @entity9 mayor said the policy to ' mug ' people living in the @entity13 was the result of a plan by @entity1 to win back voters from the @entity16			0
the policy to fund 1,000 nurses was one of the first major announcements by @entity3 @entity1 leader @entity20			1
mr @entity20 said the ' vast majority ' of the money raised by the levy on homes worth more than £ 2million would come from @entity9 and the @entity13 but it was ' fair that you share that tax across the country '			1
@entity1 's @entity3 leader @entity20 said 95 % of mansion tax will be levied in the @entity13 but that its ' benefit will be felt across the @entity32 ' but mr @entity0 told @entity33 : ' @entity1 has made a cynical calculation that they are more vulnerable in @entity3 to the @entity16 than they are , say , in the @entity13 or they are in @entity9			1
' they have decided to punish the @entity13 , or to be fiscally vindictive towards the south east of @entity5 , in order to try to bribe the @entity3 to vote @entity1			1
it 's no way to run a country			0
' he added that @entity1 wanted to ' squeeze those @entity40 until the pips squeak ' and added : ' that is a way to set up resentments and i do n't think it is the right way forward			0
' londoners perfectly accept that we have a duty to the rest of the country , we already export huge quantities in taxation - about £ 19 billion a year			0
' mr @entity20 said the mansion tax would send £ 250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there			1
he said it enabled him to make a ' uniquely @entity1 pledge ' to increase spending on the @entity59 without having to increase taxes on @entity3			0
he added : ' as much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the @entity13 of the @entity32 but its benefit will be felt across the @entity32			1
' there is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of @entity3 and how we spend it in @entity3			0
' he said the levy will go towards funding an extra 1,000 nurses in @entity3 - even though just 0.3 % will be raised north of the border ( file picture ) launching @entity1 's election campaign , mr @entity20 added : ' we will support the @entity59 and nurses and use the money from a @entity32 mansion tax to fund an additional 1,000 @entity59 nurses in @entity3 over and above the @entity16 plans that we inherit			1
' @entity1 's proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2million has proved hugely controversial , with experts – and many senior @entity1 figures – warning it is unworkable and divisive			1
mr @entity20 's comments also sparked an angry reaction in @entity5			0
conservative mp @entity87 , whose constituency is in @entity89 , said it was deeply unfair to ' clobber ' middle - class families in @entity5 to pay for health improvements in @entity3			2
' yet again , we 're seeing the @entity94 selling out the @entity5 , ' he said			0
' it 's bad enough they want to clobber the @entity13 with more stealth taxes that will inevitably hit the middle classes			0
' but @entity3 already has double the number of nurses per person compared to @entity5			2
how is it fair to siphon off the lion 's share of this revenue north of the border to pay for even more ? ' @entity107 deputy chief whip @entity106 said : ' every voter in @entity9 should read @entity1 's proposal for a homes tax in @entity9 to pay for the @entity59 in @entity3			2
' full details of the mansion tax have yet to be announced , but shadow chancellor @entity113 said last year that people living in homes valued at between £ 2million and £ 3million will face an annual bill of £ 3,000 , regardless of income			2
critics warn @entity9 and the @entity13 will bear the brunt , while fewer than 900 homes in @entity3 would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the @entity32 total			2
but because of the controversial @entity122 @entity123 applied to @entity32 funding , @entity3 will be handed a vastly disproportionate share of the takings .			0

95 % of mansion tax will be levied in @entity13 , @entity20 said
just 0.3 % will be raised in @entity3 but it will fund extra 1,000 nurses there
party proposed controversial mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2m
critics says @entity1 is ' selling out ' the @entity5 to pay for health in @entity3
