by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 teenagers are not supposed to do this kind of thing any more			0
in tennis , we hear , everyone has to wait until their early - to - mid - twenties to properly develop their talent			2
the ages of the top - ranked players back that argument up			2
but try telling it to @entity15 , the 19 - year - old painter and decorator ’s son from @entity19 ’s unfashionable capital of @entity20 , after he blitzed @entity21 on his @entity23 debut			1
the old arena has probably not seen a statement like that since @entity28 ’s extraordinary breakthrough in 1985 , when the 17 - year - old terrified the life out of his elders and betters			1
upstage : @entity15 celebrates beating @entity21 in the tournament 's biggest shock adios : nadal waves goodbye after being beaten by the younger man in the fourth round perhaps a more recent comparison is a 19 - year - old @entity41 beating @entity42 at this same fourth - round stage in 2001			1
the emerging @entity44 was by then already ranked 15 in the world , although @entity42 ’s @entity47 pedigree was more substantial than @entity21 ’s			1
this had a similar mark of nerveless youth , of someone unrestrained by understanding the potential scale of the achievement			0
it was certainly a more sensational result than its only statistical rival of the past 25 years , world no 1 @entity57 ’s 1992 ousting by the @entity59 journeyman @entity58 , who then languished at 193			0
there is more of a premium these days on core strength and stamina , which is why the era of the wunderkind is meant to be over , and why so many players are enjoying their career highs in their late twenties , even early thirties			0
eyes on the prize : @entity73 will need to show more focus than other @entity19 teen - wonders to succeed @entity15 has rendered that irrelevant with his golden arm , so quick and loose he makes that of compatriot @entity77 seem like the limb of a medium pace trundler			1
@entity19 tennis will celebrate the arrival of @entity73			0
once the cradle of champions , the game there in recent years has been on life support compared to the old glory days			0
@entity88 has been little but trouble since making the @entity47 quarter - final at 18 in 2011 , and @entity92 ’s @entity91 triumph the same year has also proved to be a false dawn			1
another @entity19 teenager , @entity94 , is reckoned to be of a similar potential to @entity15			2
feeling the heat : @entity21 's grass court reputation has been damaged by several upsets in recent years potential : @entity15 was world junior number one before turning professional last year as for @entity21 , he will welcome the extended three - week gap next year between @entity101 and @entity47			1
his two grass court @entity103 titles are becoming buried under a mound of upsets on the surface			0
as he gets older and the body becomes less co-operative , his @entity109 exertions are proving too much to recover from .			0

19 - year - old beat world number one at @entity47
young players *knocking* out established stars has become rare
this was @entity15 ' first match on @entity23
