@entity0 , one of the biggest black figures in the music industry , has spoken out about the shooting of 18 - year - old @entity4 , saying he is ' troubled ' a grand jury decided not to indict the white police officer responsible			1
but the ' happy ' singer also sparked heated debate by calling @entity4 's behavior leading up to his august 9 death ' bully - ish '			1
before he was shot dead , @entity4 was caught on surveillance camera stealing a handful of cigarillos from a convenience store in @entity16 , @entity17 , and intimidating the shop owner			1
while @entity0 says that was no excuse for officer @entity20 to use lethal force against the unarmed teen , he thinks @entity4 's actions are being overlooking in the national discussion about the tragedy			1
' it looked very bully - ish ; that in itself i had a problem with , ' @entity0 told @entity30			1
' not with the kid , but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is ok			0
the caused heated debate online intimidating : police released this surveillance camera footage , reportedly showing @entity4 grabbing a convenience store owner shortly before he was stopped by officer @entity20 and eventually shot dead ' the boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to “ get the f * * * on the sidewalk			1
” if you do n’t listen to that , after just having pushed a storeowner , you ’re asking for trouble , ' he added			0
however , @entity0 said that @entity4 's behavior in the convenience store did not warrant his death , and that he believes officer @entity20 should have been charged in the death			1
after the story was published on tuesday , @entity65 was flooded with comments calling out @entity0 's interview			1
one @entity65 user said : ' @entity70 was a bully says @entity0			1
so do we get a pass to shoot bullies in society ? way to go @entity0			2
' this is n't the first time that singer has started controversy over his opinions on race issues			0
in an interview with @entity83 last year , @entity0 angered some when he said ' the new black does n't blame others races for our issues '			2
@entity0 seemed hesitant to talk about race in the interview with the @entity92 - @entity91 monthly , saying : ' i do n’t talk about race since it takes a very open mind to hear my view , because my view is the sky view			1
but i ’m very troubled by what happened in @entity16 , @entity17			1
' however , he felt the need to weigh in on the current situation in the predominantly - black @entity105 suburb , believing ' the hangover from @entity16 is going to be a long one , worse than @entity107 '			2
no consequences : in the same interview with @entity30 , @entity0 said he was troubled that the man responsible for @entity4 's death , officer @entity20 ( pictured ) , will not face trial for the shooting anger : the grand jury decision not to indict @entity20 on any charges related to @entity4 's death sparked violence between protesters and police in @entity16 , @entity17 monday night @entity107 was another unarmed black teen , 17 , who was shot dead two years ago near to where he lived in @entity121 , @entity122 , by a man who thought he was a burglar			1
shooter @entity124 was controversially acquitted on any charges in the teen 's death			2
while his comments sparked a debate online , it 's clear that @entity0 feels a strong connection to the current situation in @entity16 , @entity17 , where protesters turned violent after hearing the grand jury 's decision monday night			1
following the decision , @entity0 tweeted : ' i 'm heartbroken over the news of no indictment in @entity16			1
let 's all pray for peace '			0
and on monday night 's episode of @entity144 , he made the contestants he was mentoring switch out the lyrics in ' @entity148 ' with the line ' we need justice to unfurl '			0
he says he still believes racism exists , and that the situation in @entity16 may have been calmer if the president went there to show his support			2
' he did n’t have to go and take a side ; all he needed to do was show his presence and everybody would have straightened up			0
but he did n’t go			0
i wo n’t fault him			0
he ’s a man with a lot of weight on his shoulders , but i personally would have gone because being a “ man of the people ” means you ’re right there with them in it			0
@entity169 and @entity170 led by example			0
' ' the new black ' : @entity0 previously caused controversy during an interview with @entity83 earlier this year			2
in the interview he said ' the new black does n't blame others races for our issues ' @entity0 also made the strange decision to praise @entity180 during the interview , for the comedian 's history preaching tough love to black youth			2
@entity180 is currently under fire after several women have come forward to accuse the @entity189 star of rape			0
' i agree with him			0
when @entity180 said it back then , i understood ; i got it			0
listen , we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves			0
@entity180 can talk that talk because he created @entity198 , he tried to buy @entity199 , he portrayed a doctor on @entity189 and had all of us wearing @entity202 sweaters			0
you ’ve got to respect him , ' @entity0 said .			2

the ' happy ' singer says the @entity16 , @entity17 teen was acting ' bully - ish ' before he was shot dead by a white police officer in august
however , @entity0 adds that he 's ' troubled ' grand jury decided not to indict officer @entity20 on any charges in the fatal shooting
