by @entity0 published : 15:46 est , 1 april 2012 updated : 15:46 est , 1 april 2012 the spectre of yet another scam , exhumed by the @entity3 , is back to haunt the beleaguered @entity4 - both in @entity5 as well as at the centre			1
the party was dealt a fresh blow on saturday when the @entity3 named the late chief minister of the state , @entity9 in a chargesheet filed before a special court in connection with the disproportionate assets case of his son , @entity15			1
the investigating agency charged @entity9 with entering into a ' criminal conspiracy ' to allot land to two pharmaceutical companies in exchange for investing in the business empire of @entity15 as a quid pro quo arrangement			1
probe : @entity15 ( left ) and his father @entity9 , the late cm of @entity5 this is for the first time that the @entity3 has included the former chief minister 's name in the chargesheet			2
it named @entity15 as accused number 1 , followed by 12 other individuals and firms			2
however , the agency told the court that it had not considered @entity9 's name for prosecution as he was not alive			2
the direct mention of @entity4 has left the already besieged @entity4 in the state crimson - faced , because the current government is seen as a continuation of the dispensation helmed by the late party leader			1
most of the ministers , who were privy to the decisions allegedly taken by @entity9 while making questionable land allotments , also secured berths in the @entity50 government			2
unsurprisingly , the @entity4 headed by @entity15 has demanded that the @entity3 also prosecute these ministers , if it found fault with the @entity9 government 's decisions			1
the development comes at a time when the @entity4 government in the state is afflicted by multiple crises			1
the agitation for the separate state of @entity62 has brought governance to a virtual standstill in @entity5 , with @entity65 as well as mps of the @entity4 themselves hopping over to the side of the protesters			1
under pressure : @entity5 chief minister @entity50 doubts have been raised about cm @entity50 's leadership ever since he took charge and allegations of corruption have also been levelled often at the current @entity4 government			1
furthermore , several party leaders are shifting loyalties to the @entity4			1
the @entity4 - led @entity80 government is also neck - deep in trouble , with a spate of scams related to the @entity84 , 2 - g spectrum allocation , coal block allocation and army truck deals surfacing one after the other			1
now , as the @entity3 has indicted @entity9 in the illegal assets case of @entity15 , one of the @entity4 's two citadels in the @entity92 ( the other being @entity93 ) looks all set to crumble			1
the party 's leaders in the state are trying to wash their hands off the matter by peddling the argument that they could not be held responsible for the acts of omission and commission made by @entity9 during his regime			2
' the state 's cabinet does have collective responsibility , but the ministers are not responsible for surreptitiously struck deals , ' @entity105 president @entity104 , who was a key member of the @entity4 cabinet , claimed			1
@entity114 @entity113 president @entity112 , however , rejected the defence put up by @entity104 : ' till his death , @entity9 was a congressman			2
so , the party has to pay the penalty for whatever decisions he had taken , ' he said			2
@entity120 accused @entity15 's likely arrest in the case is also giving the @entity4 sleepless nights			1
sources in the party revealed that the @entity3 may not arrest @entity9 's son till the completion of bypolls to 18 assembly seats in the state in june			1
this was because the ruling party was apprehensive that @entity15 's incarceration at this stage would trigger a serious law and order problem in the state , and there was every possibility of the sympathy factor working in his favour during the byelections			2
significantly , if @entity15 's party wins all the 18 seats , @entity4 leaders could shift en masse to his camp			1
in paragraph 69 of the chargesheet , the @entity3 said investigations had revealed that in 2006 , @entity149 , @entity150 of @entity151 , and @entity152 of companies director @entity153 had hatched a criminal conspiracy with @entity9 as well as senior @entity158 official @entity156			0
the latter , who was then the @entity150 of the @entity5 @entity161 , and @entity9 allegedly colluded to allot 75 acres of land at the @entity163 at @entity164 in @entity166 district to the two industry head honchos without in violation of rules			0
@entity170 has a copy of the chargesheet filed by the @entity3 the @entity3 disclosed that land was allotted at ` 7 lakh per acre , which was well below the fixed rate , thereby giving a benefit of ` 17.20 crore to the two pharma companies			0
as a quid pro quo , @entity178 - through the relatives of @entity149 - invested ` 3 crore in @entity180			0
@entity181 and its director had pumped in ` 4.5 crore into @entity184 and ` 15 crore into @entity185 , promoted by @entity15			0
the @entity3 pointed out that @entity188 chief general manager ( projects ) @entity189 had rejected the file sent by @entity191 recommending the allotment of land , stating that the deal could not be struck at just ` 7 lakh per acre			0
yet @entity191 had ordered that the corporation give the ' inprinciple letter of allocation ' to the two companies at the same rate citing an approval from @entity4			1
@entity191 got the clearance papers signed by @entity9 who had , in turn , personally handed them over to the pharma company representatives , the @entity3 alleged			0
intriguingly , the entire exercise was completed in a day			0
the @entity3 also found fault with the @entity9 government for letting @entity178 transfer 30.33 acres out of the land allotted to it at @entity210 industrial estate at @entity211 in @entity212 to another company , @entity213			0
' @entity15 , in league with his father @entity9 , @entity191 and @entity188 official @entity216 entered into the nefarious deal of allotting land to @entity178 and @entity181 at @entity219 by violating norms			0
other group companies joined the conspiracy and are , therefore , liable for prosecution , ' the @entity3 chargesheet said			0
the @entity3 authorities said these were just a few companies that had benefited from dealing with @entity9			0
in an apparent damage - control exercise , state cabinet minister @entity226 said the @entity50 government would take back the land allotted to certain companies by @entity4			1
the @entity3 has been investigating the case following a high court order in august 2011 , based on a petition filed by former state minister @entity234 , who had alleged @entity15 had amassed wealth to the tune of ` 43,000 crore during the regime of his father @entity9 between 2004 and 2009			0
the business empire of @entity15 began with taking over of @entity240 in 2001 from its original promoter @entity242 with an initial paid up capital of ` 53.51 crore			0
in 2005 , @entity15 brought in ` 124.60 crore investments into @entity240 from two @entity246 companies - @entity245 and @entity247			0
the @entity3 report says @entity15 's auditor @entity249 had manipulated the valuation reports of @entity251 and @entity252 to jack up their values to enable them sell the shares to several high profile investors and companies at a premium of ` 350 per share			0
@entity15 had allegedly created fictitious transactions of selling 82 lakh shares of @entity240 at ` 18.75 each to five companies - @entity261 limited , @entity262 , @entity263			0
@entity15 had allegedly diverted the funds from the @entity240 to float four subsidiary companies - @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity265 several companies such as @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity151 , @entity273 and individuals such as @entity275 had invested in @entity15 's media house .			0
