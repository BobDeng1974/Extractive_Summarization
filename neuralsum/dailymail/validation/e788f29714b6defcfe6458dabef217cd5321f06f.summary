a whirlwind romance quickly turned into a nightmare for a @entity3 grandmother who married a man 20 years her junior in @entity6			1
@entity7 , 52 , from @entity8 , met husband @entity9 on a night out when he was in the @entity3 on a student visa			1
at the time , she was 41 with two children from a previous relationship and he was 21			1
' he was handsome and charismatic , he said he 'd treat me like a queen and i would never want for anything			2
he told me everything i wanted to hear , ' she told @entity18 show @entity17			0
@entity7 , now 52 , from @entity8 , met husband @entity9 when she was 41 and he was 21 she said @entity9 persistently text and called her after they first met so , in the end , she thought ' why not ' and started dating him			1
not long after they had been together , he suggested he move into her family home as he could n't afford the rent on the place where he had been living			0
then as his student visa neared its expiration date , they decided to get married just months after they had first met			1
' he had come to the country on a student visa , he had n't been able to finish the course , he needed to send money back home , otherwise people would n't be able to eat			2
i admired him for staying and doing what he had been doing to keep his family going , ' @entity7 said			2
' i entered into the relationship besotted and in love , it was dream			0
' after a whirlwind romance , the couple married in the @entity6 @entity7 's son @entity44 , who was ten when they got together , said their relationship did seem to move quickly			1
he said : ' i was young so i did n't know about relationships but it felt quick			0
i went from seeing him a couple of times a week to him always there and staying			0
' @entity7 and @entity9 travelled to his native @entity6 to marry in 2006 - but she said she immediately regretted it			1
' on my wedding day it was a wonderful day but i had doubts in the back of my mind , i was thinking " am i doing the right thing ? " @entity7 said @entity9 had been charming and charismatic before they tied the knot ' the day after we married we had argument , his eyes were bulging , he put his face in mine and said " you are my wife now , you do as you 're told "			1
i was frightened , i thought " what have done ? i think i 've made a big mistake			0
' @entity72 said @entity9 was aggressive and violent when they returned to the @entity3 and spoke of one harrowing incident - which he denies - when she said he whipped her with a belt			1
she said : ' he held me to the floor and he took his belt off whipped me over and over on the top of my thigh			0
i was crying screaming and begging for him to stop and he carried on			0
i asked " is this how you control your girlfriends ? " and he shouted " yes " back to me			0
' @entity7 said @entity9 put her under pressure to take out loans so he could send money back to his family in the @entity6			1
as a result , she racked up debts of £ 15,000			2
she said life with @entity9 was ' awful ' with ' spiralling debts ' and constant arguments but the marriage lasted for five years before he left			1
following the breakdown of her marriage , @entity7 is now £ 16,000 in debt now a grandmother of one , she said she had n't seen him since and is desperate to track him down so he can help her pay off her debts and she can get a divorce			1
she said : ' i was with this man for a long time and i have debts i ca n't pay			0
i want to find him and see if i can get money from him as half of the debts are his			0
' before i met @entity9 my credit rating was good			2
now at the rate i am playing it back , it will take 17 years to clear the debt			0
' as the loans were taken out in @entity7 's name , she would have to prove she was coerced into taking them out for the debts to be written off			2
she said : ' unless i can find out where he is , i ca n't recover it , i ca n't even divorce him as i ca n't serve him the papers			0
' @entity18 was able to get a statement from @entity9 who admitted his marriage had been violent at times but he denied the allegation that he had whipped his wife with a belt			2
he said he never forced @entity7 to take out loans and as far as he is concerned , they are divorced - as he said he secured this in @entity6 in 2012			1
@entity17 is on @entity18 thursday at 9pm			0
