he was in very poor health and he has recently died			2
he was a friend of yours and he had reposed a high degree of trust in you			2
' you abused that trust in the most despicable way			0
the peace that he should have been entitled to find in his final days was contaminated by the memory of your betrayal			0
' you used your access to his financial affairs to steal all his money from him - his modest life savings - and having stolen it you squandered it on yourself , on drinking , gambling and some consumer durables			0
' when he died very recently the money he intended to put towards the cost of his funeral had gone			2
it is a case that is sad and in some ways tragic			0
' it represents a breach by you of a high degree of trust			0

there were in that time 28 cash withdrawals starting on february 3 this year for £ 300			2

it was money he had accumulated very slowly over the years from his modest lifestyle and the small pension he was getting			0
' in a statement he said that the money was for his family to pay for his funeral			0
