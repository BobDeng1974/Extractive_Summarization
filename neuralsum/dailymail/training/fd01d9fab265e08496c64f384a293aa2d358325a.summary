the @entity1 journalist who first noted the significance of @entity4 's controversial number plate has slammed the tv crew 's claims that any reference to the @entity8 was a coincidence			1
@entity10 , the reporter who runs @entity11 , first spotted what he thought was a reference to the @entity8 on @entity16 's ' @entity15 ' number plate on september 19			1
tweeting a photo of the vehicle , he asked if anyone else noticed the reference to the 1982 conflict			1
within a few days , the number plate had caused such outrage among locals that the @entity4 crew had been chased out of the country			1
but mr @entity10 has now told @entity39 the suggestion it was a coincidence is absurd given the history of the show			1
he said : ' no one who has seen every series of @entity4 can think that it was a casual thing			1
@entity4 always makes these kinds of jokes			1
' we have a profound respect for what @entity4 means to the history of television			1
but we just regret that @entity4 does n't respect its audience and dignifies them with a proper explanation of what went on			2
' writing in his column in @entity59 after leaving the country , @entity16 later maintained the number plate scandal was not deliberate , and said that if it had been , the @entity62 would have fired him			0
recalling how the number plate controversy came about , @entity16 said when he asked the office to find a @entity66 , only two were available			2
one was grey and the other black			0
he said because black ' does n't work on television ' he chose the grey one , and ' did n't even see it ' until he arrived in @entity1			2
the @entity66 had a licence plate that read @entity71 which locals believed was in reference to the @entity8 ; @entity16 said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them the @entity4 convoy pictured prior to fleeing the country , with the offending number plate attached to the front of the lead car @entity16 went on to say no one in the @entity4 crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in @entity88			1
its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet , the show 's executive producer has said			0
government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in @entity97 two weeks later , @entity16 said			0
the were told to change it before they arrived , which @entity16 said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed			0
to make up for continuity issues involving the plates @entity16 said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look ' idiotic ' when he was driving around @entity16 said they then formed a ' cunning plan ' to make - up for the number plate swap			2
they created joke plates - saying @entity112 - which they planned to film may and @entity113 fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look ' idiotic ' when he drove it			0
but before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars			0
the @entity125 plates were then removed , revealing an old personal plate underneath , which they left on , then drove off			0
the cars were later abandoned			0
the episode featuring the incident is due to air over two parts on december 27 and 28 .			0
