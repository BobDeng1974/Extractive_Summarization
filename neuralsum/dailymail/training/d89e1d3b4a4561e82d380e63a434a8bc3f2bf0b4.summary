it took seven years for @entity1 to build his cult - hero status at @entity3 but @entity4 believes the @entity6 ’s six - minute outburst has damaged his legacy and made him look like a ‘ fool ’			1
@entity1 , now at @entity9 , launched an expletive - laden attack at his former boss after sunday ’s 25 - 21 defeat by @entity13			1
it was in response to claims that he left the @entity19 club for a pay rise but @entity4 , who has a history of using explicit language , questioned the underlying reasons behind the tirade ‘ he ’s made a little bit of a fool of himself , ’ said @entity13 ’s director of rugby ( below )			1
‘ it was a great game of rugby , a titanic battle between two big clubs , unfortunately overshadowed by a premeditated and personal attack on me and the club			0
@entity1 ( right ) launched a verbal tirade against his old boss @entity4 on sunday @entity13 coach @entity4 is dismayed by the comments and claims they have sullied @entity1 's standing ‘ he was a cult hero here and unfortunately he seems to have tarnished that			1
as a club , we treated him in an honourable and professional manner			0
i have a good reputation for looking after players			0
to call the club a bunch of amateurs having done what we ’ve done in the last 134 years is incorrect , is n’t it ? ’ having spent most of his career in @entity53 , @entity1 has some close allegiances with the @entity56 side			1
as well as being a favourite among fans , he previously owned an @entity6 restaurant with assistant coach @entity60 and is uncle to the children of @entity13 forward @entity63			1
former @entity65 lock @entity64 scored a crucial 20th minute to set @entity13 on course for victory @entity9 came roaring back into the contest , however , with winger @entity69 scorching over in the corner the @entity9 pack put the squeeze on @entity13 but the @entity13 held on for a famous victory sunday ’s outburst came the day after @entity1 , 33 , had lunch with academy coach @entity76 , but @entity4 insists all of his squad were privy to the situation surrounding @entity1 ’s self - funded move to @entity80			1
‘ the peer group who played with @entity83 know the whole scenario about where he was in the pecking order with @entity88 , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i want to remember @entity83 as the guy marauding around the field in a @entity13 shirt			2
i ’ve known @entity83 for a long time			0
he was a far better player when he left than when he arrived			0
@entity9 full back @entity92 ( left ) has has been accused of insulting @entity13 fans ‘ the exact truth was @entity1 did n’t want to be rotated			1
he then said , “ if you ’re not going to play me i ’ll find somewhere else ”			0
i said , “ @entity100 , here is the amount i would like to release you under contract , as this is one of the premier positions in the world ”			0
@entity9 were interested but would n’t pay that fee			2
in the end we ended up agreeing a release fee ( £ 100,000 ) with @entity1 so he could go and play somewhere else			2
that was his choice , not mine			0
’ the @entity6 is expected to face a lengthy ban for his choice of words , with @entity116 authorities investigating the incident alongside @entity92 ’s alleged abuse towards home supporters			2
@entity120 revealed that @entity92 was accused of threatening to ‘ take the face off ’ a @entity13 fan			1
