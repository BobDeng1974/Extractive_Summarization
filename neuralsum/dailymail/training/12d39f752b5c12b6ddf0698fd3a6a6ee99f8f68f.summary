@entity1 's hopes of fighting @entity2 in a $ 50million @entity4 send - off have suffered a potential setback			1
the @entity7 's promoter , @entity6 , is currently negotiating a new deal with his fighter and expects him to return in september or october			0
but he wants @entity10 to face the hard - hitting @entity12 @entity11 , rather than @entity1 , as reported by @entity13			2
out cold : @entity1 stopped @entity14 in the eighth round of their rematch at @entity18 ' @entity11 will continue to be the first choice assuming he beats [ @entity21 ] @entity20 , and if @entity10 says no to @entity11 , then we 'll look to @entity1 , ' @entity6 told @entity13			2
@entity1 retained his super-middleweight world titles last weekend with a stunning eighth - round knockout of @entity14 in front of 80,000 fans at @entity18			0
the @entity27 has admitted he could hang up his gloves but dreams of finishing his career in the fight capital of the world			0
but he might have to wait until next year if @entity10 agrees to fight @entity11 , a fight that had been mooted for this summer before negotiations stalled			1
option : @entity1 has targetted a @entity4 send - off against @entity2 @entity11 instead defends his @entity37 and @entity38 middleweight titles against former world champion @entity20 in @entity40 's @entity39 on july 26			1
and @entity11 's trainer @entity42 is confident his charge would beat @entity1 if the two were to meet			0
' @entity1 is a gallant warrior , but makes too mistakes and if the fight can be made , i see @entity11 capitalising on them to stop him in the last part of the fight , ' he told @entity51			1
another option for @entity1 is another domestic dust - up with mandatory challenger @entity54			1
the @entity55 has ruled that @entity1 must face the @entity56 within the nine months or be stripped of the belt			0
domestic : @entity54 is @entity1 's mandatory challenger after beating @entity59 last weekend			0

@entity1 wants to fight in @entity4 before he *retires*
@entity2 is his most likely *opponent*
but @entity7 could fight @entity11 in the *autumn*
@entity54 is another option for @entity1
