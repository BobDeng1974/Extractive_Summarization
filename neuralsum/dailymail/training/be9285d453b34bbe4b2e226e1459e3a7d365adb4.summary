by @entity0 @entity2 's decathlon hopeful suffered an embarrassing ' schoolboy error ' at the @entity4 after not one but two false starts in front of 40,000 people			1
@entity8 fluffed his start on the sprinting blocks twice ahead of his 100 metre race in @entity12 on monday			1
' i just went a bit too early – twice – just school boy errors really , ' @entity8 said			1
' you learn to start when you are seven or eight and i forgot how to do it today			0
' @entity2 's @entity8 ( c ) through back his head back in despair after false starting for the second time in the @entity22 100m heats the athlete dropped to the floor at @entity26 during the @entity4 , in @entity12 , after his second mistake @entity8 blamed the second false start on a noise he thought he heard			1
' the bloke on my inside was a bit loud and it could have just been him breathing			0
i knew straight away and punched the ground , ' he said			1
' i definitely knew it was me , the guys i 'm competing against i do n’t think they 're silly enough to go twice			0
' i knew it was me straight away , i could see i was well ahead of everyone and my start is not that good			2
' obviously there were a few nerves being my first senior comp , i got a bit too excited and went twice			0
' @entity8 ( c ) punched the floor in frustration after his ' schoolboy error ' @entity8 was eliminated after the second false start and walked off the track with his hands on his hips ( @entity52 ) @entity53 of @entity54 , @entity55 of @entity56 , @entity8 and @entity57 of @entity58 look annoyed after the error the rising star 's double mistake is likely to have cost him his promising chance of getting a medal			1
decathlon events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all			2
the sprint race would have added valuable points to his tally and @entity8 has admitted that he considered ditching the competition after the error			1
' for a couple of seconds i was like , ' do i really want to be here ? ' and then my mind changed pretty quickly ' yes i do - this is what i have trained for for two years i wanted to get back out on the track ’ , being inside that stadium is ridiculous , ( there are ) 40,000 people for ( the ) decathlon , ' he said			2
@entity8 went on to compete in the @entity22 shot put on monday he also took on the long jump competition despite originally wanting to quit the @entity4 after his fail on the track he tweeted some words of encouragement ' decathlon is 10 events , not nine not one			1
i have got eight events now after the long jump , i am looking forward to those , i have got a few throws to show them how @entity2 compete			0
' i felt decent in training			0
i usually compete well over the whole 10 events at major champs so i do n't come here to go away without something to take from it			0
a medal was definitely in the plan now it is just keep ticking away get a few @entity99 and a few individual wins - three throws three victories that would be nice			2
' after his fail on the track he tweeted : ' " tough times come and go but tough people last forever " @entity105			0
