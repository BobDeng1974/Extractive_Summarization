hydrocolloid plasters and dressings are said to absorb moisture from the wound but at the same time create a protective barrier so that oxygen , water and bacteria can not get into the wound			0
this creates a moist , humid environment which promotes faster healing , and prevents scarring as a hard scab does n't form			2

mr @entity53 , a father - of - two , from @entity86 , @entity87 , said : ' it 's not good			2
it 's definitely affected her , she 's fully aware of it and it looks terrible , to be honest			0

' mr @entity53 , 31 , noticed the burn on january 26 and took @entity6 to see a doctor the following morning while his wife @entity118 , 29 , was at her telesales job			2
mr @entity53 , a coach driver , added : ' the doctor said it must have been an allergic reaction to the patch			1
' it looks awful , like a second degree burn			0
' she does n't seem to be in too much pain from it , which makes me worry her nerves may have been damaged			0
' there have been reports of people suffering allergic reactions to hydrocolloid wound dressings			2
one report found the allergic reaction was caused by an ingredient called ' pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin ' as a tackifying agent , to make the plaster sticky - though it is not known if this ingredient caused @entity6 's reaction			1
