@entity0 has a good way to go before being mentioned in the same breath as @entity5 legend @entity4 ’s , but he can begin to write his own chapter in history with victory on thursday			1
the festival sprung to life for @entity12 on day two and the son of @entity14 , who sports the same colours as his illustrious predecessor , has undergone an unusual preparation for the hurdling feature following three starts over fences			0
it was a path also trodden by @entity4 ’s and @entity12 will be hoping lightning strikes twice for the six - year - old who displayed great tenacity to land the @entity26 from @entity27 in january			0
@entity28 can being to write his own chapter in history with a win at @entity1 on thursday the bare form of that performance is arguably short of what is required but if his handler has managed to extricate some improvement he should be thereabouts			1
@entity38 and @entity39 appeal as outsiders capable of outrunning their prices			0
having backed @entity43 ( @entity1 , nb , 2.40 ) for the @entity44 , i was frustrated to see him rerouted for thursday ’s @entity46 , but it still looks a smart move by connections			1
@entity50 ’s gelding was runner - up in the race last year when outstayed by @entity53 and i wonder , with hindsight , if jockey @entity55 may have employed a more patient ride as he became a sitting target late on			0
a recent @entity59 romp should have put the selection spot - on and he could go one better this year and end the @entity62 hoodoo in this race			0
with the @entity66 stable carrying all before them , @entity64 will be a popular order in the @entity69 ’ @entity46			2
however , he will be priced accordingly and @entity71 ( @entity1 , 1.30 ) looks a sound alternative as he was reported to be a little ring - rusty when edged out by @entity74 at @entity75 last time			2
@entity76 , pictured during the @entity77 in 2013 , was rerouted for the @entity46 the selection had previously beaten that foe by an impressive eight lengths at @entity81 and appears to jump a shade more fluently than @entity84 ’s charge , who remains one of the chief dangers			1
there will be plenty of tips doing the rounds for the @entity92 but @entity93 ( @entity1 , nap , 2.05 ) is a solid conveyance for a race of this nature and may run well at a big price			1
the nine - year - old lacks the profile of a number of his rivals , but was a creditable third in the race last year — beaten by just a nose and a neck — and looks to have been campaigned with just one race in mind all season .			0

@entity111 backed for the 3.20 at @entity1 on thursday
@entity76 has been rerouted for thursday ’s @entity46
@entity114 may run well at a big price for the @entity92
