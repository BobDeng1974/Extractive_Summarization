lensman turns ' the skin into a canvas ' with pictures of made - up models in stark @entity6 landscape when most of us take pictures for the family album we want to be able to recognise who is in the shot			1
but photographer @entity13 has dedicated his time to making his subjects look like they are not even there			2
in these remarkable snaps bodies are painted to mimic backdrops of deserts and snow - covered fields			1
the hills are alive ! @entity13 - @entity13 's painted ladies peak at the mountains this pair were boulder - ed over by the stunning scenery they could n't see the wood for the trees , now they are the new forest the @entity31 , who lives in @entity32 , @entity33 , has spent has spent the last 15 years taking pictures in the @entity35			1
he was inspired by seeing that there was ' no separation between the universe and myself			2
' @entity13 , a professor at @entity32 , said : ' i scarcely see the final result large enough to enjoy it			2
only when i make large prints do i enjoy them			0
' for me , turning the skin into a canvas for the imagination is both an artistic and a spiritual endeavour			1
sometimes we all need a moment to reflect never again would the husbands be trusted with the sunblock			0
what a way to get a precipice of the action he claimed the painted look transformed the body ' into a living sculpture , lit up by its godly colours ' that could reach its potential ' to tune in or become an extension of the cosmos			0
' ' as i conceive it , skin painting marks a person 's external appearance while also bringing out the inner self , ' @entity13 said			1
' they put us in contact with nature and with the raw , at the same time , they turn us into non-natural beings , opening the way to experience the invisible or the unknown			0
spot the difference - looking out over the desert what 's black , and white , and red all over ? not these two , they are a little blue			1
@entity13 sets up his models for the perfect picture			1
the professor daubs his model in blue paint to match the sky ' body and earth are one			0
if the body is seen from the back , the front becomes an open field , a place that can not yet be identified , a place of possibilities			0
' in working with the bare and painted body , i am also working with the demands and challenges of a body - mind state that i call , " not two - many twos			2
" ' for example , without clothes the body regains its undivided primary nature , being intricately part of the forces of the universe , it is no longer estranged from the environment nor split into an upper and a lower part			0
' ' the visual works i come up with are a continual study of how we physically , rhythmically relate to this universe from the specific , intimate bodyhouse			0
