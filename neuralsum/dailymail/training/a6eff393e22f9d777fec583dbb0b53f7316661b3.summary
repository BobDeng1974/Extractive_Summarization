large parts of @entity2 city are in lockdown and world leaders have begun arriving in the @entity6 capital ahead of this weekend 's @entity8 summit			1
@entity10 prime minister @entity9 , @entity12 president @entity11 , @entity14 president @entity13 and @entity16 's president @entity15 are among the first world leaders to arrive in the country for the talk-fest			1
' it is a meeting of the leaders from the largest economies in the world , ' mr @entity41 said			0
' it focuses on what each country should do to try and improve their growth and create more jobs , on the basis that if everyone moves together you 'll get a better outcome			0
' but @entity26 prime minister @entity25 is expected to come under pressure to address other issues such as climate change , following major commitments from the @entity61 and @entity62 to slash emissions , and @entity64 , with @entity10 prime minister @entity9 to press for a more committed response to combating the disease			1
@entity67 the main game for this weekend 's summit is to boost global economic growth			1
in february , the @entity8 finance ministers came together and agreed that each country would make a plan to boost global growth by 2 percent by 2018			1
@entity16 's president @entity15 ( left ) arrives at @entity76 to attend the @entity37 in @entity2 police patrol a walkway along the @entity79 ahead of the @entity8 conference on thursday since then , each country has been coming up with an individual action plan to contribute to realising this goal , which they will present to other leaders at the summit			1
avoiding another financial crisis @entity89 political science expert @entity88 says the target of this year 's @entity8 is to strengthen the global economy so countries will be more insulated should another financial crisis hit			2
' they 'll be talking about infrastructure , bridge building and road building , ' dr @entity88 said			0
' really traditional economics , because those are the things that employ people and when people are employed you have a stronger economy			0
' dr @entity88 said the @entity2 summit would be a very ' nuts and bolts ' type of summit			0
' it will look at the workings of economies and how to strengthen them , ' he said			0
' we 're not going to see grand plans , i do n't think there will be the " @entity117 " or anything			0
' @entity14 's president @entity13 ( right ) emerges from her plane after arriving for the @entity121 's @entity37 @entity123 's crown prince @entity122 ( centre ) is greeted by dignitaries after arriving in @entity2 @entity126 also on the agenda will be tax avoidance by multinational corporations			1
' there 's the @entity132 / @entity8 action plan , looking at trying to plug the loopholes in the laws so that companies ca n't use devices to shift profits to lower or no tax jurisdictions , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' @entity140 ' banks mr @entity41 said the long - running issue of financial regulation will also be on the table			2
' one of the big things that they will be trying to come up with is an agreement trying to stop the " too big to fail " banks from needing governments to put money into them , ' he said			2
' these big banks have to have more of their own capital so if they get into problems they wo n't have to rely on the taxpayer bailing them out			0
' history of the @entity8 @entity26 prime minister @entity25 is determined to keep the focus on economics , despite pressure to address issues like climate change and @entity64			1
historically , the @entity8 has always had a fiscal focus			0
it started in 1997 as an annual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in response to the @entity167 financial crisis			0
but in november 2008 , following the global financial crisis , there was recognition that economic issues had the potential to drag the entire world down so it was agreed that world leaders should also attend			0
@entity64 , @entity175 and climate change mr @entity41 says so - called side issues - like climate change , @entity175 and the fallout from @entity180 - still have an economic impact and will likely be addressed			1
police officers patrol around a fence near the @entity184 on thursday ' the rising tensions like what 's happening the @entity187 , or in @entity188 and @entity189 , they do impact on the world economy , ' he said			0
' @entity191 revised down its forecast for global growth next year because of these rising geopolitical tensions			2
' the @entity8 is n't the @entity195 and it does n't come up with or negotiate big peace settlements or emissions targets			2
' but leaders can have a frank discussion about those issues and provide some political leadership and momentum towards dealing with then			0
' @entity10 prime minister @entity9 ( left ) posing with @entity26 prime minister @entity25 during a morning walk around @entity204 on friday			1
mr @entity9 arrived in @entity26 overnight ahead of the @entity8 awkward for @entity205 there will be a main meeting – otherwise known as a plenary session – attended by all leaders where they will follow a fixed agenda			1
@entity214 personnel are seen during a training exercise at the @entity216 and @entity217 in @entity2 in addition , world leaders will hold one - on - one or bilateral meetings			0
' i do n't think security issues will come up in the main meeting but in side meetings they will come up			0
' ' it 's a bit like speed dating , they 'll line them up and @entity25 will meet a whole lot of [ other leaders ] as the chair of the summit , ' mr @entity41 said			2
mr @entity25 has called for an apology from @entity236 president @entity235 over the loss of 298 lives , including 38 @entity26 , when the @entity180 plane was shot down over eastern @entity187 in july			1
but there are other non-economic issues he has made it clear he does not want to discuss , such as climate change			2
so far , the @entity26 @entity8 presidency has resisted making climate change a top agenda item , but it will likely be discussed after this week 's historic carbon emissions reduction deal between the @entity61 and @entity62			1
earlier this week the two major polluters announced an ambitious agreement to slash their greenhouse gas output by 2030			0
@entity10 prime minister @entity9 has also indicated that he will press world leaders including mr @entity25 to do more to combat @entity64 , which has so far killed more than 5000 people in @entity253 .			1

the main game for the @entity8 summit is to boost global economic growth
each country will present their plan *outlining* how they will contribute to the @entity8 goal of boosting global growth by 2 percent by 2018
corporate tax avoidance and ' too big to fail ' banks also to be addressed
there will be potential awkwardness for @entity25 who does not want to talk about climate change after @entity61 - @entity62 commitment to slash emissions
@entity10 *pm* @entity9 to push mr @entity25 on @entity64 response
