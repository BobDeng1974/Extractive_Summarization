by @entity1 reporter published : 14:33 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 15:50 est , 24 october 2012 the top federal prosecutor in @entity3 announced wednesday that he is suing @entity4 for more than $ 1 billion for mortgage fraud against @entity6 and @entity7 during the years around the financial crisis			1
@entity10 attorney @entity9 said @entity11 , which was later bought by @entity4 , churned out mortgage loans from 2007 to 2009 without making sure that borrowers could afford them			1
' the fraudulent conduct alleged in today ’s complaint was spectacularly brazen in scope , ' @entity9 said in a statement			0
he said the suit was partly to recover money that @entity6 and @entity21 lost from defaulted loans			2
foreclosure : an internal review at @entity11 found that 57 percent of @entity26 loans went into default @entity10 attorney @entity9 described the conduct of @entity11 as ' spectacularly brazen in scope ' @entity4 had no immediate comment			1
@entity11 sold the loans to @entity6 and @entity7 , which were left to pay for the loans when they defaulted , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity6 and @entity21 were effectively nationalized in 2008			2
according to the lawsuit , @entity11 used a process called ' the @entity26 , ' shorthand for ' @entity38			2
' the idea was that mortgage loans , as they were being processed , would ' move forward , never backward			0
' the lawsuit alleged that @entity11 traded quantity for quality and eliminated underwriters , even from mortgage loans for which borrowers did not have to get their income verified			1
instead , loan processors simply entered data into an automated underwriting system , and if the system gave the go - ahead , ' no underwriter would ever see the loan , ' the lawsuit alleged			0
with few checks and balances , there was ' widespread falsification ' of the data entered into the program , @entity9 charged			0
' @entity26 ' : the idea behind @entity11 's scheme was that mortgage loans would ' move forward , never backward ' @entity4 's share price over the past week loan processors were given little guidance , the suit said : checklists for making sure that loans were compliant - for example , assessing whether the income level that a borrower listed was reasonable - were eliminated			1
bonuses were based solely on how many loans an employee could process , not the quality			0
the lawsuit said that @entity11 executives were aware of the dangerous path they were treading			0
for example , a quality review in january 2008 showed that 57 percent of @entity26 loans went into default			1
instead of notifying @entity6 and @entity21 , @entity11 instead set about concealing the quality of the loans it was selling them , the suit said			1
it said @entity11 even offered a bonus to quality - control workers who could ' rebut ' the default rates that the review had found			0
the government - controlled mortgage buyers @entity6 and @entity7 had to be effectively nationalized in 2008 @entity4 bought @entity11 in july 2008 the lawsuit did n’t give specifics , but it accused @entity99 , and later @entity4 , of selling ' thousands ' of @entity26 loans to @entity6 and @entity21			1
@entity4 bought @entity11 in july 2008			0
@entity6 and @entity21 buy mortgage loans from banks , package them into securities and sell them to investors			2
the idea is to free up banks to make more loans			0
if a loan defaults , @entity6 and @entity21 guarantee payments to the investors			0
according to the lawsuit , @entity6 and @entity21 do n’t review the loans before they purchase them			2
instead , they rely on banks ’ statements that the loans meet certain qualifications			0
@entity9 said the lawsuit was the first civil fraud suit brought by the @entity118 concerning loans that were later sold to @entity6 and @entity21 .			1

@entity11 - owned by @entity4 - sold mortgages without *adequately* checking if borrowers could pay
the loans were sold on to @entity125 and @entity7 , who were left with the *bad* debt when home *owners* defaulted
the process was known as ' the @entity26 ' within @entity11 - at one point 57 percent of the loans had defaulted
*situation* contributed to @entity6 and @entity21 being nationalized in 2008
lawsuit is first civil fraud suit brought by the @entity118 concerning mis - sold mortgage loans
