by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 3 october 2013 a girl has been banned from wearing a wristband to support injured soldiers because her school deems it a health and safety risk			1
@entity7 wears the @entity9 band in honour of her cousin and brother , who are both in the military			1
but teachers confiscated it because they said she might injure herself by getting the wristband caught on a door handle			2
now @entity18 , in @entity19 , has sent a letter to the parents of every pupil warning them that charity wristbands may not be worn with school uniform			1
banned : @entity7 , 11 , is not allowed to wear her @entity9 wristband at school outrage : @entity7 's mother @entity27 , left , was shocked when her daughter 's wristband was confiscated 11 - year - old @entity7 decided to start wearing the wristband , which raises money for injured troops , to support her cousin @entity33 , 17 , who serves in the @entity34 , and her brother @entity35 , 20 , who is training to join the @entity37			1
' i was given a choice of handing over my band or getting a red letter , which is something you get for bad behaviour , ' she said			0
' i was told off in front of all the class and i just wish i could have been quietly spoken to about it and i could have explained that i wear it in support of my cousin and brother			2
i am still going to wear it because it is a cause close to my heart			0
' her mother @entity27 , 41 , from @entity56 in @entity57 , said that banning the wristband was like stopping pupils from wearing a poppy on @entity61			2
tribute : @entity7 , pictured holding the letter sent out by her school , wears the wristband in honour of her cousin in the @entity34 and her brother @entity35 , right , who is training for the @entity37 charity : proceeds from the sale of the @entity9 wristband go to help wounded troops ' i know that things like earrings and nail varnish are not part of the uniform , but i think a charity wristband is a bit different , ' she said			1
' i went into school and spoke to the teacher about it , and was told they would continue to confiscate it because she 's breaking health and safety rules			2
' i was stunned when they sent a newsletter to all parents on thursday saying that they could get them snared of door handles and get injured			0
' they are made of rubber , in all likelihood they would snap if that happened			0
and what about watches and blazers that can get caught on things - are they going to ban them now ? ' in my eyes , wearing a wristband is exactly the same as wearing a poppy , so what are they going to do when it comes to @entity113 ? ' i ca n't remember a day where @entity7 has n't worn her wristband and i think it 's quite nice that she 's so young and understands the importance of wearing it all the time			1
' school : @entity7 is a pupil at @entity18 in @entity19 - on - @entity121 letter : the school wrote to all parents warning them not to allow children to wear wristbands to class another parent at the school , who did not want to be named , added : ' to ban a charity wristband is wrong anyway - but banning them because they are dangerous is just ludicrous			1
' headteacher @entity133 said that only the official school uniform could be worn due to safety concerns			0
' while the @entity18 fully supports many charities , we also have to maintain high standards in health and safety and in presentation , ' she said			1
' rubber and plastic wristbands are not permitted in school because , not only do they not form part of our school uniform , but if they were to get caught on items such as door handles they may cause injury			0
' pupils are allowed to attach their wristbands or other decorations to school bags to show their support for their chosen charities			0
any wrist bands worn at school will be kept safe by the class teacher until the end of the school day			0
' last month the school became an academy for 202 pupils between the ages of four and eleven after the @entity163 took over failing @entity164 , which was placed into special measures by @entity166 in june last year .			0

@entity7 , 11 , wears the wristband to support her brother and cousin
but teachers at @entity18 in @entity19 confiscated it for health and safety reasons
her mother says the bands are no different to @entity113 poppies
