critic : @entity2 senator @entity1 is a former @entity3 member a former officer in @entity3 , the unit that killed @entity5 , said that ‘ veterans and special forces community ’ are determined that president @entity6 be voted out in november			1
@entity1 , who retired in the rank of commander in 2008 after 23 years of service , said on tuesday that @entity6 was guilty of a ' despicable ' attempt to divide veterans and discredit those who , like him , opposed the @entity15 ’s policies			1
a @entity17 state senator in @entity18 who served two tours in @entity3 as a junior officer in the 1990s , @entity1 was speaking to @entity21 at his party ’s convention in @entity24 , @entity25			1
he was awarded two @entity26 and rose to become acting commander of the @entity28 and deputy commander of @entity30 in @entity31			0
@entity1 , 50 , has been singled out on the @entity6 campaign website as being part of ' an interconnected web of @entity17 operatives who are launching " @entity36 " - style smear tactics ' -- a reference to the @entity40 group that assailed senator @entity41 , the 2004 @entity42 nominee , over his @entity44 record			1
some of the @entity45 who were on the operation that killed @entity5 in @entity47 , @entity48 in 2011 served under @entity1 and he has met a number of them since the @entity53 leader 's demise			1
@entity1 is now heading up an @entity54 called @entity55 for @entity56 and is in @entity24 to unveil a new ad that takes @entity6 to task for bowing to the king of @entity60			1
scroll down to watch the political ads @entity62 : @entity1 believes @entity6 has claimed too much credit for the success of the @entity5 raid last year ' @entity66 ' : special operations for @entity68 has produced an ad criticizing the president for bow to @entity72 of @entity73 furious : @entity1 said the president 's new ad , ' one chance , ' makes political sport of the @entity5 raid , which risked the lives of the @entity45 who carried it out ' the veterans and the special forces community is firmly behind a change of leadership of the commander - in - chief , ' he said			1
' there is no doubt about that			0
' @entity6 crossed ' the line , ' he argued , by creating a campaign ad to coincide with the first anniversary of the killing of @entity5 that trumpeted the president ’s role in ordering the operation			1
titled ' @entity97 , ' it features president @entity98 as saying that if @entity45 had been ' captured or killed ' then ' the downside would have been horrible for [ @entity6 ]			1
' ' no one ever disputed that he made the decision , ' @entity1 said			1
' i respect that fact			0
what i find appalling is that he would make a political commercial with former president @entity98 talking about it			2
that 's where the line was and i think that action is what upset many			2
hiding : @entity5 hid from @entity56 troops for nearly ten years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks ' but do n't tell me that the consequences of failure were just political , difficult thought the decision was			1
the consequences of failure would have been the troops on the ground losing their lives and military families back home losing a father , losing a husband			2
' dissatisfaction amongst serving and former seals was first reported by @entity21 in april			0
the hard - hitting @entity132 ad , called ' bow to nobody , ' shows @entity56 special operations troops on maneuvers			1
@entity136 @entity135 speaks the words of a former @entity3 , saying : ' we sacrifice not because we have to			2
' we bleed not because we want to			0
we fight because we need to			0
and sometimes we die because we love this country			0
' he concludes ; ' i believe in @entity56 exceptionalism			0
as a @entity3 seal i fought so that i would never have to see my president bow to anyone			1
' a photograph of @entity6 bowing before @entity72 at a g - 20 gathering in @entity148 in april 2009 then flashes up on the screen before the message : ' 2012 new leadership			1
' @entity1 said this action and that of bowing in 2009 to president @entity154 , whose father was president when his country bombed @entity157 , demeaned @entity56			1
' i ’ve seen tears cried watching our president bow			2
it has nothing to do with protocol			0
it has to do with the symbol of @entity56 bowing , ' he said			2
' as president , it 's unacceptable			2
i believe this president thinks the world is better off without @entity56 leading and his actions have stated that he believes @entity56 is better off being one of the pack rather than being the leader			0
' the ad , he said , was the first of three focusing on the theme of @entity56 exceptionalism			0
' this first one is very emotional , a personal story , to a degree , about me and about why i fought , ' @entity1 said			2
opposition : special operations for @entity56 demands a new commander - in - chief in a commercial that blasts @entity6 for bowing to foreign leaders advocate : @entity6 enlisted the help of former president @entity98 to describe the possible fallout if the @entity5 raid had ended badly politics : @entity1 believes @entity6 has also tried to draw admiral @entity197 into the political fray ' we need to maintain our leadership and the reason why we fought is that our president does not have to bow before any king or emperor			1
' @entity1 said he was saddened but not surprised to be singled out by the @entity6 campaign			1
' this is what the @entity6 administration does			2
they use misinformation , half facts , they try to distract from the issue and to a large degree they try to discredit			0
' our nation owes a debt of gratitude to anyone who serves honourably			0
i think it 's despicable that a president would put veterans on his website and list them on an enemies list			2
' we can have the debate about the issues and i do n't dislike the president personally but i do n't favour @entity231 politics			0
we should stick to the issues			0
' @entity1 said that @entity6 was seeking to politically exploit senior officers who were still serving , including admiral @entity197 , head of @entity56 @entity235 , and general @entity236 , chairman of the @entity237 and @entity56 ’s senior uniformed officer			1
when facing questions about his role in the @entity5 operation , @entity6 said last week : ‘ i 'd advise that you talk to @entity243 , who 's in charge of our @entity55			1
i think he has a point of view in terms of how deeply i care about what these folks do each and every day to protect our freedom			0
' @entity1 said that apart from botching @entity197 ’s rank -- he 's a @entity3 officer , not in the @entity254 -- @entity6 was attempting to politicise a senior officer			1
' active duty military should be apolitical			0
to try to somehow pin them in a corner i think is an act of desperation			0
' ' @entity56 do n't want to see our military become @entity17 or @entity264			0
@entity56 appreciate that our military belongs to all of us			0
but there is a difference between a veteran speaking out and active duty			0
' i respect admiral @entity197 , i know him personally and i think he 's a great leader but if veterans ca n't speak out , then who can ? ' @entity273 is reporting from the @entity274 in @entity24 , @entity25			0
