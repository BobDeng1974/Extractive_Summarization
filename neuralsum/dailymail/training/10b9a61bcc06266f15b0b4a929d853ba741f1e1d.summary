by @entity1 correspondent published : 11:06 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 2 november 2012 so far he has yet to master the phrases ' please may i have another bun ? ' and ' @entity6 , a mouse ! ' but @entity9 the elephant has made a start , by learning how to speak five words in a human - like voice			1
the 22 - year - old male , housed in a @entity15 zoo , places the end of his trunk in his mouth and , rather than coming out as a low rumble , the sound matches human speech in pitch and tone			1
look who 's talking now : @entity26 and @entity27 of the @entity28 recording @entity9 's vocalizations at the @entity30 in @entity15 last week , @entity32 researchers told of a white whale that liked to tell divers to get out of his pool			1
@entity38 , as he was called , was also fond of holding burbling ' conversations ' with himself			0
however , he ' spoke ' for only a few years			0
@entity9 , in contrast , has been chatting away in @entity15 since august 2004 , when he was 14			1
sometimes he speaks when prompted , other times without any encouragement , the journal @entity43 reports			0
researcher @entity26 , an expert in elephant communication , said : ' human speech has two important aspects , pitch and timbre			2
' intriguingly , @entity9 is capable of matching both			2
this is remarkable considering the anatomical differences between an elephant and a human			2
' ms @entity26 and her colleagues played recordings of @entity9 's calls to native @entity15 speakers to see if they could understand what he was saying			1
' we found a high agreement concerning the overall meaning , and even the @entity15 spelling of @entity9 â€™s imitations , ' ms @entity26 said			1
it is thought that @entity9 , an @entity68 elephant , learned to mimic human speech to bond with his trainers when he was kept alone for five years as a young animal			2
his five words spelt phonetically are annyong , anja , aniya , nuo and choah			0
they mean : hello , sit down , no , lie down and good			0
despite @entity9 's apparent ingenuity , scientists do n't think that he actually means what he says			1
they add that he might not be the only pachyderm which has proved to be a good mimic			0
african elephants have been known to imitate the sound of truck engines , while a male in a zoo in @entity85 was said to talk in both @entity86 and @entity87			0
however , his abilities were never scientifically investigated .			0

experts *suggest* @entity9 's vocalisations are an *attempt* to bond with *handlers*
as a calf he was the only elephant in the @entity15 zoo where he lives
