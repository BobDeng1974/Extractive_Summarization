criticism : former @entity2 minister @entity1 used a @entity4 debate to criticise @entity5 police warned a former minister he could be prosecuted for harassing a ‘ nightmare constituent ’			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 used a debate in @entity10 to heavily criticise @entity5 which spent six months investigating him for alleged racist abuse after describing @entity12 as ' unkempt '			1
he warned that the police actions were a ‘ clear breach ’ of parliamentary privilege which if unchallenged could see allow any unhappy voter to pursue a grudge against their mp			2
mr @entity1 , mp for @entity20 and @entity21 , raised concerns about mr @entity12 during a debate in the @entity4 in march			1
but this led his constituent to step up an ‘ onslaught of vile abuse ’ , mainly against him , including doctoring photographs of his children taken from social media sites and urging him to commit suicide			1
during the march debate mr @entity1 , who was education minister until last year , said he was ‘ sacking mr @entity12 as my constituent ’			1
he added that his staff had been told to put the phone down on him			0
mr @entity1 said he planned to inform mr @entity12 of this information in a letter but instead sent a complete @entity40 record which included the march 13 debate			1
but today the mp revealed that sending the copy of @entity40 resulted in him receiving a police information notice ( @entity43 ) from @entity5			1
the pin warned that this action had caused ‘ alarm and distress ’ to the ex-constituent and warned he would be liable to arrest and prosecution if that kind of behaviour continued , according to mr @entity1			1
the @entity2 told the @entity4 today he believed @entity5 's actions represented a ‘ clear breach ’ of parliamentary privilege			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ if this goes unchecked , any constituent with a grudge against his or her member of @entity10 could claim harassment			1
‘ any mp exposing any dodgy organisation in @entity10 could find themselves being questioned by the police and ... being given advice as to how to do our job			0
‘ indeed , @entity66 may well have a case against ( home secretary @entity68 ) for being rightly beastly about him in @entity10 and find herself on the receiving end of a police information notice			1
’ mr @entity1 's motion for the pin to be referred to the @entity73 was passed unopposed in the @entity4			1
moving the motion , mr @entity1 said he had no communication with his ex-constituent since sending the @entity40 record while he claimed mr @entity12 had ‘ stepped up an onslaught of vile abuse ’ , which included targeting the leader and chairman of @entity82 , among others			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ many come under the heading of political abuse which , however offensive that is , we all know it is part of our job			1
‘ however , what is not part of that job is they have included doctored photographs of my children taken from their social media sites - what a man in his 40s is doing trawling the social media sites of teenage girls i do not know			2
‘ they were eventually taken down but he then attempted blackmail - to put them up again - against me unless i comply with his demands			0
‘ he 's posted doctored pictures of the council leader 's young children with @entity110 insignia			1
‘ he has posted vile contorted accounts of my parents ' divorce , forged tweets , posted references to my neighbours , photographs of my home , most recently a direct tweet urging me to commit suicide , along with assorted lies , made - up stories and pure fantasy			0
’ battle : @entity12 has been embroiled in a long - running online battle with mr @entity1 mr @entity1 said despite making complaints to the police , mr @entity12 had been arrested once and no charges were brought against him			1
he said : ‘ the police have failed to secure any charges and he carries on harassing , bullying , stalking , trolling and abusing me , my family and colleagues			0
’ on september 4 , mr @entity1 said a pin notice was served against him			2
he said : ‘ the notice stated the police had received an allegation of harassment against me by the aforementioned constituent , making me aware if the kind of behaviour described were to continue , then i would be liable to arrest and prosecution			2
‘ and the specific single incident behaviour which gave rise to this pin was the act of sending a copy of @entity40 to my constituent			2
‘ apparently this had caused my ex-constituent alarm and distress			0
that came as a surprise to me and various others , particularly given on his blog on march 14 that ex-constituent had described how he had watched my adjournment ( debate ) on television with great amusement			0
‘ apparently @entity40 is a cause of alarm and distress			0
our deliberations are a potent weapon of abuse if you work for @entity5			2
’ warning : mr @entity1 said the episode raised concerns about the ability of mps to do their job mr @entity1 said there was no way to appeal against a pin and it remains on file for at least 12 months			0
he added that detective chief inspector @entity181 had also offered him instructions about how he should correspond with constituents without risking a pin			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ police telling us how to do our job			2
the chief constable , who has been copied in to all these events , has been content to waste taxpayers ' resources on this nonsense while senior management of his force are brought into disrepute and he has clearly lost the plot when it comes to distinguishing between the victim and the perpetrator			0
’ in a statement , @entity5 said the matter is related to an investigation into a series of allegations and counter allegations ‘ where all parties have in turn been considered as victims and suspects ’			2
assistant chief constable @entity211 said : ‘ we have attempted to mediate between all of the parties involved in this incident for some time , but some have declined to engage in this process and our attempts to do so have not been successful			0
‘ we did not wish to criminalise anyone , but it became apparent that the issue was not going to be resolved among those concerned and that some form of action was necessary in order to prevent it escalating further			0
‘ after much consideration and independent scrutiny , the decision was taken to bring matters to a conclusion by issuing pins to all of the parties involved			0
however , it appears that mr @entity1 does not consider the matter closed			0
‘ in his speech mr @entity1 focused in particular on the supply of the @entity40 record to suggest that @entity5 has interfered with the parliamentary process			1
the person who received the @entity40 report believed it to be a continuation of harassment against him and subsequently reported it to us			0
‘ we would never seek to interfere with parliamentary processes or privilege , but i strongly support actions taken by the force , which have been subject to independent legal scrutiny			0
we will of course await the views of the @entity73 before commenting further			0

@entity1 said @entity12 , of @entity252 descent , was unkempt
led to ‘ onslaught of vile abuse ’ involving doctored photos of @entity1 's children
@entity1 sent him a copy debate where he said he ' sacked ' him as constituent
@entity5 issued police information notice for causing ' distress '
