@entity6 , of @entity11 , near @entity12 , died after doctors at @entity14 diagnosed a migraine and discharged him			1
angry : grieving mother @entity5 , left , has been left furious after a nurse accused of neglecting her dying son @entity6 , right , was given a warning and allowed to continue working by a disciplinary panel mr @entity10 , who was @entity6 ’s named nurse , did not carry out regular observations or make notes about his condition			1
he said ‘ just do n’t touch it ’ when the youngster complained about his bulging , pus - covered eyes			1
tearful @entity6 was taken home , only to be rushed back hours later having suffered a fatal seizure			2
an @entity9 tribunal ruled that stiffer sanctions against mr @entity10 would be inappropriate , despite his standards falling well below what was expected			2
the panel noted there is no suggestion that mr @entity10 was responsible for @entity6 ’s death			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' every allegation against @entity10 was proved and they just give him a warning - it is unacceptable and it is disgusting			1
' they are saying @entity10 was not to blame for @entity6 ’s death , but if he had been checking on him , he could have given @entity6 the treatment he needed and he might not have died			1
' in october , a @entity44 panel decided not to strike off dr @entity45 , the consultant in charge of @entity6 ’s care , despite a series of failings on his part			2
warning : the @entity9 decided not to strike off @entity10 , pictured the @entity9 decision is the latest blow to mrs @entity5 ’s efforts to get justice for her son , who would have celebrated his 19th birthday next week			1
she has made complaints against other nurses involved in his care and is waiting to hear whether the @entity9 will act upon them			0
mrs @entity5 added : ' i hold every single , stinking last one of them responsible for my son ’s death - they failed him completely and absolutely			1
' he could have been saved , there are things that could have been done for him that were n’t			0
' summing up the @entity9 panel decision , chairman @entity72 told mr @entity10 : ' a caution is proportionate to the misconduct in this matter and will remind you to check on all patients in your care , respond to their needs as required , and not overlook any individual patient			2
' while we recognise your excellent professional standing since 2005 , we had to take into consideration the public interest and need to uphold the reputation of the profession			0
' you ignored information from a colleague and suggested that the colleague also should not provide care to that patient			0
' you failed to report observations on the patient who was in your care during the course of your shift			0
' by not making records as you should have done , you deprived both clinicians and ( @entity6 ’s ) mother of a clinical picture of how his condition progressed during your shift			0
' ms @entity72 said the panel considered giving @entity101 conditions of practice or a suspension , but decided these were too strong for one ' isolated ' incident of misconduct			0
she added : ' these charges arose from one shift in the course of a 33 - year career			1
' before the shift and in the years since , you have never been subjected to disciplinary proceedings , nor have concerns been raised regarding your practice			0
' you are held in high regard by your peers , and the risk of repetition of this misconduct is slight			0
' the caution will remain on mr @entity10 ’s file for the next five years .			0
