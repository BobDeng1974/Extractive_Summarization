these heart - warming pictures show the moment a baby giraffe came down to earth with quite a bump after its mother gave birth			1
two friendly giraffes stood guard from hyenas as the mother spent 30 minutes patiently waiting for the birth			1
slowly but surely the calf begins to emerge , with the mother momentarily dropping to all fours before standing straight again , causing the baby to fall around six feet on to its back			2
just minutes later , the mother 's two friends come over to see the baby , watching as the giraffe begins to lovingly lick its offspring clean			2
one of the mother 's friends even bends down to help , as the calf begins to perk up and take in the world for the first time			0
as the newborn quickly discovers , taking your first steps is never easy , as it stumbles around and falls over several times			2
eventually the calf gets to its feet and tentatively edges its way towards its mother for a feed			0
later the baby was seen plodding carefully around , its mother following behind as it tried to continue preening the playful calf			0
@entity72 : the mother giraffe seems somewhat unbothered considering she has just given birth in full view of a group of tourists and two of her friends loving : as the calf raises its head and takes in its first view of the outside world , the mother bends down to to tend to her newborn , tenderly nudging its head friends : another giraffe , which had been standing guard , wanders over to inspect the new calf as the mother starts licking her offspring clean speaking of the moment of birth , mr @entity36 , 32 , from @entity93 , said : ' it was so special - i 've never seen anything like this before			1
' what do we have here ? two other giraffes stand behind the mother as they crane their long necks to try and get a first look at the newborn calf baby steps : the calf stumbles and its short legs quiver as it tries to get to its feet for the first time , failing at several attempts to do so tour operator @entity36 , 32 , captured the miracle of birth after stumbling on it by accident during a safari in the @entity27 , @entity28			1
he spoke of the moment he and his tour group spotted the giraffe giving birth : ' it was so special - i 've never seen anything like this before , ' he said			2
' when we approached the giraffes we noticed something dark hanging out of one of their backs and we immediately realized she was in labour			0
' not to disturb them , we waited a good distance away and it was really interesting to watch the others guard the one in labour as there were some hyenas sniffing around			0
' ' after about 30 minutes the baby came out bit by bit and finally fell about two metres on to its back , ' mr @entity36 , from @entity143 , said			1
' only 15 seconds later , the new - born lifted its head and the mother started cleaning it carefully			0
' after another half an hour - and several failed attempts - the baby finally managed to get up on its long feet and started looking for milk			0
' success : after just half an hour in the outside world , the calf eventually clambers to its feet and tries to take its first steps in the @entity28 safari and we 're off : the calf , which spent 15 months in its mothers womb , carefully plods along as its mother tries to keep up with and continue preening it			1
