by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 17 december 2013 updated : 14:50 est , 17 december 2013 if you 're tired of having to dispose of your dead christmas tree year after year , one entrepreneur might have the answer			0
@entity5 is offering people the chance to rent a tree for the festive season before re-planting the fir at his @entity12 farm			1
the businessman has grown 3,000 trees , since setting up his business @entity16 five years ago			2
@entity17 is the brainchild of @entity5 , left , and his wife @entity18 , right			1
the couple have grown 3,000 fraser fir trees at their @entity12 farm the trees are carefully pruned and tended to by mrs @entity18 and her husband before they are delivered to households across the country at the end of november businesses and families across the country can then rent one , with mr @entity5 delivering the trees at the end of november			1
once he has picked up the trees in the first week of january , they are planted back in the ground in tubs and linked up to a watering system that revives them			2
the trees are fed a litre of water each day and are carefully pruned by the 52 - year - old and his wife @entity18 , 42 , ready for @entity42 the following year			1
the aim is to reduce the number of people throwing trees away and cut down on the use of plastic replicas that are harmful to the environment			1
after testing a range of varieties the couple decided to grow @entity54 trees , because they do n't drop their needles , have a better shape and are hardier than other breeds			2
most @entity42 trees have roots that grow around three feet into the ground - but @entity5 's trees have shallow roots so they can be grown in pots			1
the trees grow between 6ft and 7ft and cost £ 99 to rent			0
mr @entity5 , pictured with two of the @entity42 trees , rents each tree for a set fee of £ 99			1
as the festive season draws to an end , he picks up each of the trees , returning them to the farm to be re-planted the trees are popular with families , including the @entity77 family , left , and businesses			1
right , @entity79 decorates the tree rented by @entity82 solicitors in @entity12 mr @entity5 said : ' the idea came from us seeing discarded @entity42 trees , we saw people just leaving them in car parks after the festive period			1
' we thought it was such a waste so we looked at ways that they could be reused time and time again			0
' we tried different types of trees but in the end we settled on the @entity54 fir			0
' they take about 10 years to grow into a full 6ft sized tree so we purchased some from a grower in @entity102 and and set up the business five years ago			0
' we have up to 3,000 trees at the farm which are on a drip irrigation system that gives each one a litre of water per day			2
' people can rent trees for as little as one or two days or from the end of november to the first week in january at a fixed price of £ 99			2
' they do need to be regularly watered as they are a live plant but because they are alive , they do not drop any pine needles			0
the @entity77 family tree is decorated and ready for the festive period , left			0
and the rented tree at @entity82 stands pride of place in the reception area ' we drop the tree off and collect it at the end of the season before placing the pot back into a bigger container in the ground			0
' it 's much more environmentally friendly than simply discarding trees and people do n't have to worry about what to do after @entity42 now			2
' the rented trees have been an instant hit with families and businesses snapping up all 3,000 trees this year			0
@entity136 from @entity82 solicitors in @entity12 said : ' when i went down to the @entity141 farm it was a real delight to see how they care and restore the trees			1
' we get so many compliments on our wonderful christmas tree , it 's absolutely beautiful			0
' it has a real story behind it that we tell people when they come in and it 's lovely to know that we are supporting the environment			0
