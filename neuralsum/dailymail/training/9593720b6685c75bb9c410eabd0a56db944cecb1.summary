by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 29 january 2013 the relocation of a senior politico has seemingly ended the @entity5 administration 's aims to close @entity6 , despite statements to the contrary the special envoy responsible for overseeing the closure of the @entity12 prison at @entity6 has been taken off the job in a clear sign that the @entity5 administration no longer plans to shut the facility down			1
on monday the @entity17 reassigned @entity18 , the special envoy for closing the @entity20 prison and will not replace him , according to an internal personnel announcement seen by @entity22			1
his office will be closed and his former responsibilities , mainly working on diplomatic issues surrounding the relocation of detainees , will be folded into the office of the department ’s legal adviser			2
the move seems to show that the @entity5 administration does not see the closing of the prison as a realistic priority , despite announcements by the president to the contrary			1
mr. @entity18 will now work on issues including @entity39 and @entity40 as the department ’s coordinator for sanctions policy			1
mr. @entity18 ’s special envoy post was created in 2009 , shortly after mr @entity5 took office and promised to close the prison in his first year			1
he traveled the world negotiating the repatriation of some 31 low - level detainees and persuading third - party countries to resettle about 40 who were cleared for release but could not be sent home because of fears of abuse			2
but as @entity56 imposed restrictions on further transfers , mr @entity18 was eventually assigned to also work on resettling a group of @entity39 exiles , the @entity59 , who were in a refugee camp in @entity63			1
@entity64 , a spokesman for mr. @entity18 ’s office , said : ' we remain committed to closing @entity6 , and doing so in a responsible fashion			1
detainees at @entity69 at the @entity12 @entity70 , @entity20			1
the facility has been at the centre of a number of controversies housed on a naval base in @entity20 , the camp was set up to hold suspected terrorists captured on the battlefields of @entity79 in early @entity81 number of scandals have hit the site over its 10 - year history			1
allegations of mistreatment at the camp surfaced early on and the @entity12 has faced frequent attacks from human rights groups for holding inmates without trial			1
the @entity12 claim the prisoners are ' enemy combatants ' who do not have the same rights of prisoners of war or @entity12 citizens			2
there have also been numerous reports of inmates being tortured at the hands of their @entity12 captors			2
three detainees committed suicide in 2006 , although there were other failed attempts before that			2
during his 2008 campaign , mr @entity5 described @entity6 as a ' sad chapter in @entity12 history ' and said the @entity12 legal system was equipped to handle the detainees			1
according to the @entity12 authorities , 779 detainees have been held in @entity6 and all but one of the 779 detainees were foreign nationals			2
as of december 2011 , 171 men from more than 20 countries were still held at @entity6			0
' the administration continues to express its opposition to @entity56 restrictions that impede our ability to implement transfers			2
' the announcement came as @entity126 and four other @entity128 detainees appeared before a military tribunal over the september 11 attacks			0
they made their first public appearance since october on monday , sitting quietly in a high - security courtroom at the naval base in @entity20 as pretrial hearings resumed			1
the five men were arraigned back in may of last year			0
yesterday one of the prisoners fired one of his military attorneys in an apparent sign of distrust of his @entity144 - appointed legal counsel			0
@entity145 at first refused to speak when questioned by the judge about his desire to dismiss one of his three lawyers , @entity148 maj. @entity148			0
he hinted at his motivation later in an exchange with the judge about whether he wished to attend future sessions of the court			0
' we have been dealing with our attorneys for about a year and a half and we have not been able to get any trust with them , ' the @entity155 said through an @entity162 translator			0
the dismissal of the attorney came at the start of what is expected to be a four - day hearing to address a wide range of pre-trial legal issues			0
@entity170 is one of the lesser figures among the five defendants in the case			0
he allegedly ran an @entity175 training camp in @entity79 where two of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks trained			0
he is also believed to have been a bodyguard for @entity180			0
defendants in the military tribunal have civilian counsel in addition to military lawyers			0
@entity126 , who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the sept. 11 attacks , added an additional death penalty specialist , @entity190 lawyer @entity189 , to his team monday .			0

@entity18 , who oversaw prisoner relocation , transferred to new role
move appears to show closure of prison at @entity12 naval base is low priority
@entity5 administration has repeatedly said it will shut the site
