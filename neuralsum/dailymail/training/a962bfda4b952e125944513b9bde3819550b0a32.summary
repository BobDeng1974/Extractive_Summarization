by @entity0 published : 02:51 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 20 march 2013 hidden : files on celebrities accused of sex crimes , like @entity5 , were likely hidden from most police officers , it emerged today hundreds of files on celebrities , politicians and other vips accused of sex attacks and abuse were so heavily protected by senior police that investigating officers could not access them , it emerged today			1
information on high profile suspects was marked as ' secret ' or ' restricted ' and only available to a small number of officers - a system which may have helped prolific offenders like @entity5 and mp @entity22 escape prosecution			1
the approach to sensitive files was designed to stop officers from leaking information to the media , experts say			1
the issue of detectives being unable to access relevant intelligence was highlighted in a report on the effectiveness of the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) in the wake of the @entity37 scandal			0
it came after complaints about @entity37 made to different police forces across the country while the tv presenter was still alive were not able to be shared by detectives			0
@entity45 commander @entity44 confirmed that famous people were protected by high levels of confidentiality built into intelligence systems			2
' any high - profile or sensitive case will be restricted on our systems because we are not going to let 50,000 people ( @entity45 officers and staff ) across @entity56 read sensitive material about celebrities , politicians or other high - profile people , ' he told @entity61			2
' we have had some officers and staff who were prepared to leak information to the media for payment and the mechanism to prevent that was to restrict access to that information			2
' but police believe their new @entity34 , launched in 2011 , will help prevent similar errors in the future			0
the system allows sensitive material to be located but accessed only with the right clearance			0
claims : former mp for @entity79 @entity22 was another high profile abuser believed to have been protected by police speaking after the report was published last week chief constable @entity83 , the association of chief police officer 's lead on intelligence , said the current system is capable of being interrogated by any trained officer across the @entity89 to ' identify suspects , offenders and patterns of behaviour '			1
the @entity94 of @entity95 in @entity96 said that police had put the protection of celebrities before children			1
but spokesman @entity100 added that he believes police are striving to ' get it right in future '			0
the first national shared database for police in @entity105 and @entity106 was set up in 2003 , while a later system in 2006 allowed officers to search for intelligence but restricted access to sensitive records .			0

hundreds of *documents* on famous suspects marked ' secret ' or ' restricted '
experts believe that celebrities like @entity5 protected above children abused
police claim tight circle was to prevent any leaks to the media
