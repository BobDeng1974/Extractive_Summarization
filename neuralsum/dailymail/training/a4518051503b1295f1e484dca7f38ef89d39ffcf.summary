a young mother died from cervical cancer – after being turned down for a smear test nine times by her gp			1
@entity5 , 22 , visited her local surgery nine times in two months complaining of stomach pain , fatigue and abnormal bleeding			1
but doctors repeatedly sent her away , saying her symptoms were caused by her body getting back to normal after the birth of her son @entity14			1
she visited doctors nine times repeatedly complaining of stomach pain , abnormal bleeding and bloating but doctors told miss @entity5 , left , and her mother @entity21 , right , that her symptoms were the result of her having just given birth to her son @entity14 , and added that due to her age there was ' no cause for concern ' miss @entity5 , pictured with her mother @entity21 ( right ) passed away in february this year			1
her mother is now campaigning to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16 , believing had her daughter been tested at 16 , it might have saved her life they failed to give her a smear test , as the national minimum screening age is 25 , and told her there was ‘ no cause for alarm ’			1
miss @entity5 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , was finally sent for a camera scan last april at her local hospital , but the test was too late to save her			1
as her terrified mother @entity21 looked on , the doctor who carried out the procedure exclaimed : ‘ @entity49 , how long have you been like this ? ’ miss @entity5 , a care worker , was given just ten months to live and died this february			1
now her mother is backing an e-petition calling on the government to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16			1
she believes her daughter would still be alive had she been offered a test			0
mrs @entity5 , 46 , from @entity56 in the @entity57 , told @entity59 ’s @entity58 her daughter had ‘ not long had a baby when her symptoms appeared ’			2
mrs @entity5 told this morning she is desperate to raise awareness of cervical cancer and said she wants to see the age at which women are first asked for a smear test lowered from 25 to 16 dr @entity67 told this morning the age limit for smear tests was raised from 20 to 25 after concerns high numbers of young women were receiving treatment they did n't need			1
she said : ' the age limit used to be over 20 in @entity75			1
' the reasons it was changed was based on @entity79 , it was n't financially driven			0
' the cervix systems develop in the early 20s for a lot of women			0
' we were getting multiple abnormal smear results for lots of young girls , which were causing anxiety and some were having treatment that was n't absolutely necessary , and increased the risk of premature labour or miscarriage if they got pregnant later in life			1
' the thinking was cervical cancer is very rare under 25 and so the age of screening should be raised			1
' that is awful for you to hear ( mrs @entity5 )			2
' it is really important that while we do n't screen under 25s , anyone suffering abnormal bleeding must always , always , report it to their doctor			1
' i have a rule of threes , if someone comes back with the same symptoms three times i am not getting it			0
' my advice is do n't be scared to ask for a referral for a second opinion			0
' she added : ‘ that is what they were putting it down to , that and her age			0
' she was having bleeding and she was n’t feeling very well , really tired all the time			0
she kept going and they kept telling her she was anaemic			0
‘ we really thought something was n’t right			0
she went back to the doctors nine times			0
but you never expect the @entity133 , that ’s not something you think			0
’ recalling her daughter ’s diagnosis , mrs @entity5 said : ‘ @entity5 was hysterical			2
i just went numb , i had no words			0
' i do n’t actually know how we got home that day			0
you go into this world , a frozen state , i could n’t think of anything			0
’ mrs @entity5 gave up her job to care for her daughter , and eventually moved in with her			2
she told @entity14 , now two , that his mummy was poorly			2
‘ he would kiss her tummy , ’ mrs @entity5 said , adding : ‘ he is always asking for his mummy			2
’ miss @entity5 ’s brother @entity152 said : ‘ she got so ill , @entity14 could n’t cuddle her			1
i think that ’s what broke her			0
’ and mrs @entity5 added : ‘ she was fobbed off time and time again			2
’ the @entity155 offers cervical screening tests to all women aged 25 to 64			1
they identify abnormalities which could develop into cancer			0
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 in 2003 after advice from the @entity163 on @entity164			1
experts were mindful of how rare the disease is in women under 25 , and feared the test could provide abnormal results which sometimes left women receiving treatment they did n’t need			1
about 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the @entity174			1
the symptoms are n't always obvious and may not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage			2
in most cases , abnormal bleeding is the first sign			2
it usually occurs after sex although any unusual bleeding should be investigated			0
other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex , an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine			0
around 2,900 cases of cervical cancer , pictured under the microscope , are diagnosed each year in the @entity174 if the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation , blood in the urine , loss of bladder control , bone pain and swelling in the legs and kidneys			1
the @entity155 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			2
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
if you are concerned about symptoms but are under 25 you have the right to an internal examination			0
@entity220 , of @entity222 's @entity221 , says : ' there is a pathway in place that means a patient should be checked or referred if they are exhibiting symptoms			0
' we advise women to challenge their doctor if they say they do not need a test			0
' she adds that it can help if you print out a list of symptoms , such as from the charity 's website , to make your point understood			0
' cervical cancer is rare in women under 25 , but it 's not impossible			1
