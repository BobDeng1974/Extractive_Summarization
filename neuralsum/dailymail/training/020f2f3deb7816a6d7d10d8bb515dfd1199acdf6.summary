by @entity0 follow @ @ robshepherd5 @entity1 might not be better than @entity2 but in many ways he is already bigger			1
in the modern world of sports marketing 22 - year - old @entity1 ’s image is omnipresent in @entity7			1
' @entity8 ' sees the player endorse a wide range of products from soft drinks to mobile phones and he has even appeared on the front cover of @entity15			2
on monday he will aim to endear himself further to a besotted @entity7 by leading the @entity17 hosts to victory against @entity19			0
fancy footwork : @entity1 is the poster boy for the @entity17 and his image is all over @entity7 hopes of a nation : @entity7 fans will be praying @entity1 can lead them to @entity17 glory all this from a player who four years ago could have moved to , er , @entity28			1
in 2010 agent @entity29 alerted the club to a new @entity32 wonder player at @entity33 - the club where @entity2 played			1
the @entity28 swiftly made a £ 12million bid for a player then ' unknown ' in @entity36			1
but @entity33 , and one suspects the @entity1 family , turned the offer down			1
an approach from @entity40 soon after was rejected , too			1
@entity1 moved on to @entity41 last summer			1
@entity43 skipper @entity42 , who will lead his country out against @entity45 on monday , has set a new record this summer			1
he is the first player in @entity17 history to have worn the captain ’s armband at four consecutive finals			2
one to watch : @entity54 ’s @entity53 is often left in the shadows at @entity41 despite being the club 's second top scorer behind @entity58			0
danger man : @entity53 ( left ) has impressed for @entity54 and has attracted interest from @entity61 but he showed his talent in @entity54 ’s wins over @entity64 and @entity65 and will pose a big threat to @entity67			0
@entity69 fans will be particularly interested in the 25 - year - old on monday , as @entity53 could be offered by @entity41 in part exchange for @entity72			0
@entity67 only need to avoid defeat against @entity54 to finish top of group b and stay on course for what could be a classic @entity80 soccer final			0
kicking up a storm : @entity82 and @entity67 will top group b if they beat @entity54 tonight if the @entity85 do top their group they would avoid @entity7 in the first knockout stage and most likely face @entity43 - creating a path for a possible @entity67 v @entity7 final if @entity7 , who kick off their final group game four hours after the @entity85 , much to the chagrin of boss @entity95 , top their group they would face @entity54 , who have the capability of bursting the balloons of both countries			0
@entity100 : it is not often i agree with what @entity103 has to say			0
after all , here is a manager who , after a brief period of bringing some stability to the @entity109 set up , wasted a ' golden generation ' who should have got much closer to winning the @entity17 or @entity112 when he was in charge			2
he was allowed to stay in the job far too long			0
time to go : @entity115 has taken charge of @entity109 for two tournaments with little success so far underperformed : @entity103 's @entity109 were expected to do better than two quarter finals at @entity120 but he is spot on to say the @entity122 are wrong to back @entity115 who , ahead of tuesday ’s game against @entity124 , says he wo n’t quit			1
the fact is @entity115 has been in charge for two tournaments and @entity109 have underperformed badly			1
the whole set up needs a fresh approach			0
the problem is many contenders do n’t really want the job			0
it is interesting to see that sources close to @entity136 boss @entity135 have indicated he would be willing to take on the challenge - or poisoned chalice depending on your view			1
i say he would be a good choice			0
@entity135 would be an ideal figure to nurture the young players emerging and would be tactically more flexible than @entity115			1
he would also help former @entity145 team - mate @entity144 mature into the role down the line			0
@entity148 : @entity149 and @entity1 are in contention for the @entity151 so 6 - 1 for them both to score on monday seems decent			2
lethal : @entity149 has scored three goals for @entity67 in two @entity17 games so far and given the amount of goals that have been scored a punt on four or more goals at 12 - 1 is worth a tickle			0
@entity7 to beat @entity19 4 - 0 is just 7 - 1			0
@entity17 moment : @entity19 , who play @entity7 on monday , burst on to the scence at @entity163 and were on their way to knocking @entity109 out at the quarter finals stage			2
@entity109 were trailing 2 - 1 with time running out but then @entity166 won converted two penalties .			2

@entity33 rejected bids from @entity28 and @entity40 for @entity1
@entity115 must go and @entity135 should replace him as @entity109 boss
@entity42 first player to captain a side at four @entity120
