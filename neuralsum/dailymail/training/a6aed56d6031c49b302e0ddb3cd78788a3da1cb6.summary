by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen @entity1 could be forced to sell @entity2 in order to fall in line with homegrown quotas for the @entity6 and @entity7			1
the return of @entity10 icon @entity9 means the @entity11 have one too many foreign players to meet guidelines			0
manager @entity14 has been touting @entity15 and @entity16 around to other clubs , but if there are no takers @entity2 may be the one to depart			1
@entity9 's return brings @entity1 's number up to 18			1
@entity38 's goalkeeping star @entity20 has returned from a long - term loan at @entity40 to fight for @entity1 's no 1 shirt			2
with veteran @entity43 signing a new one - year deal , @entity2 departing would allow @entity14 to bring @entity45 or @entity46 into the fold and meet the homegrown criteria			1
@entity14 said : ' from the group you are expecting us to have as a squad , i have to send one away because we have one extra foreign player			0
' so from all these players , if you think all of them have to stay , you are wrong			0
one of them has to go			0
' @entity58 understands @entity1 are conscious of the home - grown quota but are still in the process of shaping their squad ahead of the new season and no decision has been taken on the future of any particular player			0
@entity14 , meanwhile , is keen to blood several of the club 's promising academy graduates this term and has already tipped the likes @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 to win full international honours with @entity75 in the future			0
some of the @entity11 â€™ foreign stars , like new signing @entity78 and @entity80 , count as homegrown , but the departures of stalwarts @entity83 and @entity85 leave the west @entity86 short of @entity88 talent			2
contest : @entity20 ' return from @entity40 means @entity2 would have competition for the no 1 shirt stuck : @entity14 has put @entity15 in the shop window but the price tag is prohibitive @entity95 returns to @entity1 stalwart : the return of @entity7 winner @entity9 will push the club over the 17 foreign players allowed in their squad for the @entity6 and @entity102 competition			1

@entity9 's signing means @entity1 have one - too - many foreigners
@entity14 would *prefer* to get *rid* of @entity15 or @entity16
however , @entity2 could be player to depart as @entity1 have @entity20
players such as @entity80 and @entity78 count as homegrown
