a ceo who reportedly died of a heart attack in @entity2 two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the @entity4 at his remote @entity6 hideout			1
@entity7 , 62 , and his 57 - year - old wife , @entity8 , have been jailed on seven @entity10 insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard			1
each count carries a possible 30 - year sentence			2
just a few years ago , @entity7 's family appeared to be living the @entity16			1
the @entity18 immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business			0
he owned a @entity10 beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant @entity6 mountain			1
but in 2012 , as his @entity26 company slid deeper into debt , those who knew @entity7 said he 'd made some odd decisions : he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family 's many homes			1
three months later , his family said he died of a heart attack in @entity2 , his body cremated there instead of returned home			1
he was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in @entity6 @entity7 , 62 , and his 57 - year - old wife , @entity8 , have been jailed on seven @entity10 insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on saturday in @entity6 @entity4 agents execute a search warrant at the @entity49 , @entity6 , home of @entity7 on monday			1
@entity7 , a @entity51 businessman reported dead two years ago in @entity2 , was arrested in @entity6 on saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they should n't be making payments he replaced the bookkeeper he 'd used for years with a relative			1
he built a panic room with steel doors inside his @entity6 hideaway			2
and , prosecutors say , he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $ 8 million from insurance companies			2
no matter how the criminal case turns out , his arrest gives a resolute end to a long - running court battle between @entity7 's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because , for many reasons proven right , they did n't think he was dead			1
' i 've never seen anything quite like ( this case ) , ' said @entity78 , a @entity51 prosecutor working the case			0
' there was always a suspicion , but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did , and she did n't have any missteps either - until recently			2
' @entity7 , who had emigrated to the @entity85 as a youth , purchased @entity26 in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the @entity88 , where he claimed to have earned the @entity89 , the nation 's third - highest military honor for bravery			1
@entity93 with his heavily - pregnant daughter @entity95 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death			2
friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father 's reported passing in 2013 months after her father 's alleged passing , @entity101 posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below			2
neither the businessman 's daughter or son , @entity109 , have been charged with a crime the @entity88 has not responded to requests for confirmation			0
he also graduated from @entity114 in 1989 with a degree in computer science , the school said , and claimed degrees in management , mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from @entity123 , @entity124 and the @entity125 , respectively			0
@entity125 said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and @entity124 had no record of him			0
@entity123 did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation			0
by the time @entity7 bought @entity26 , it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large @entity51 showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country - style pieces made from logs			1
problems surfaced in 2012 , when @entity7 told friends and colleagues he 'd fallen ill and needed to go to @entity2 to get an experimental treatment not available in the @entity85			1
@entity8 stood by his side with an expression of worry , people who know the couple said			2
records showed they sold their @entity51 - area condo for $ 600,000			2
about this time , @entity26 was also developing financial problems			0
no one suspected anything suspicious at first , said @entity152 , who was @entity26 's bookkeeper			0
but as the company 's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars , she said @entity7 kept buying furniture for his family with company funds			1
still , she trusted the man , whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems			0
then @entity161 replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister - in - law			1
' i was n't given a reason except i was needed more on the floor and his sister - in - law could n't sell furniture , ' she said			0
before long , @entity7 headed to @entity2 to deal with his alleged illness			1
@entity7 ran the once successful @entity26 furniture company ( pictured ) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 @entity161 , 62 , and his 57 - year - old wife , @entity8 , are jailed on seven @entity10 insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on saturday in @entity6 it was there , in april 2013 , that his family said he died of a heart attack , his body cremated there instead of returned home			1
@entity26 's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy			0
@entity7 's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $ 8 million in policies he 'd obtained			1
at his june 2013 memorial service at @entity188 in suburban @entity51 , @entity161 's daughter , @entity186 , sang ' @entity189 ' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on			1
meanwhile , @entity194 had suspicions about the $ 2 million claim @entity161 's son , @entity109 , had filed , particularly the @entity2 death and cremation certificates accompanying it			1
first , the physician who signed @entity161 's death certificate never received or examined the body			1
the investigators also said there had been no autopsy			0
finally , the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where @entity7 supposedly died			1
' the insured 's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures , ' @entity194 said in court documents			0
the crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents , the company said			0
last november , @entity194 denied the claim and lawsuits were filed			0
@entity161 has not responded to several phone messages seeking comment			2
no contact information for @entity101 could be found			0
neither has been charged with a crime			0
@entity194 's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors , who opened an investigation that included surveillance			0
at the time of his supposed death , @entity161 and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep , narrow road on @entity241 in @entity6 , a remote vacation destination near @entity242			1
' it 's possible that he 's been hiding out there these past couple of years , ' said @entity78 , the @entity51 prosecutor			0
residents of the nearby village of @entity249 said the area is perfect for hiding out : only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves			0
but @entity7 apparently thought trouble was coming			2
he built a bunker in his basement complete with 20 - inch thick steel doors , said a contractor who worked on the house			0
' it made me wonder why would you need a panic ( room ) here ? there 's not that many people around here you got to worry about , ' said @entity267 , 28			0
@entity267 said @entity161 was a nice , straightforward man			2
on saturday , @entity270 security agents arrested @entity161 near the @entity241 home			1
the passport he had used to get back into the @entity85 had proved his downfall			2
the man whose name @entity161 was trying to steal was black — the photo @entity161 submitted showed he is white			1
the social security number he used was from a woman born in 1917			1
suspicious , @entity270 agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity			0
finding him was n't hard — while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged , he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct @entity6 address			2
for those who knew him , the news that he was still alive was startling			0
' i 'm just shocked			0
he did n't seem that type at all			0
he seemed to me an upstanding , @entity297 family man			2
he was nice to everybody and wanted help people , ' @entity152 said			0
