one misplaced step brought her hopes of gold crashing down			0
@entity4 and her horse @entity5 clipped a fence in the equestrian eventing final yesterday			1
in that split second , the @entity10 ’s granddaughter and her teammates narrowly lost out on the first @entity14 gold of the @entity15			1
but @entity4 ’s delight was tinged with disappointment , and when husband @entity28 rushed to comfort her , she buried her face in his shoulder			2
as the pole fell , there were gasps of horror from the royal spectators , including the @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46			1
they knew @entity4 needed to put on a perfect show - jumping performance to take gold from the @entity50			1
@entity45 and @entity44 were seen clapping their hands to their mouths in horror when the pole dropped to the floor , costing the team the crucial points			1
@entity28 immediately rushed backstage to the paddock to meet his wife			0
they 've done it : @entity64 's eventing team won the country 's second silver medal of the @entity67 despite an early mistake by @entity4 ( centre ) proud mum : @entity71 embraces her mother @entity72 , the princess royal , after being awarded the medal parading : @entity4 showed off her silver medal - @entity75 's second of the @entity67 afterwards , @entity4 , 31 , said : ‘ i made a mistake			1
he [ @entity5 ] put a foot down ... it was my fault			0
it punished me and us			0
obviously , i ’m disappointed			0
’ but over the three - day event , the performance by @entity4 – an @entity85 debutant on an inexperienced horse – far surpassed anyone ’s expectations			1
she finished as the third - strongest member of the equestrian team , ranked eighth overall and beating the scores of world no 1 @entity94 and teammate @entity96			1
and although her impressive performance was n’t quite enough for gold , it was crucial in securing a well - deserved silver medal for the team			1
when the result was finally announced , the royals – in their own way – went wild , with @entity44 raising her fists in the air and leading the family in delighted cheers			2

’ in a poignant moment , it fell to @entity72 to present her daughter with the @entity85 medal she never managed to win herself			0
after carefully placing the medal around @entity4 ’s neck , the princess royal pulled her beaming daughter close for a kiss on each cheek , as @entity4 appeared to mouth : ‘ oh , @entity128			2
’ afterwards , @entity4 joked to reporters : ‘ whatever you do , do n’t ask me what it was like to have my mother present me with the medal			2
obviously , it was amazing			0

’ despite the rain , the royal cohort who turned out to support @entity4 appeared to enjoy every minute			2
@entity44 began the day in a nautical blue and white striped top under a smart navy £ 500 @entity169 blazer , with a red and gold @entity64 badge attached			1
but when the rain began , she pulled on a rather more casual @entity64 zip - up tracksuit top , and prince @entity45 added a bright red baseball cap to his outfit			1
@entity44 , who sat between the princes , protected her hair from the rain with a black umbrella			2
later , @entity46 attempted to close it , prompting shrieks from @entity44 as drips fell on her – which @entity45 and @entity46 appeared to find most amusing			1
meanwhile @entity183 , opted for practicality over glamour , pulling on a hooded waterproof when the rain started			0

even former prime minister @entity191 was spotted sitting in the stands			0
@entity187 , who attended the cross-country event yesterday and the swimming finals last night , is proving a committed @entity15 spectator , despite apparently having recently landed a ‘ demanding ’ job with a venture capital firm			2
while there may have been a considerable royal presence , there was no doubt which particular royal the 20,000 spectators in the @entity205 arena had come to see			0
@entity4 received deafening applause both before and after her events from spectators from home and abroad			2
when asked what it felt like to have won the silver medal , a smiling @entity4 said : ‘ it ’s unreal			1
this time last year i would n’t have even thought i ’d have been here			0
' we had the greatest time			0
yes we wanted gold , but we made mistakes , but when [ the silver medal ] got put round our necks , it was all worth it			0
’ @entity4 added that she was ‘ really proud ’ of her ten - year - old horse , who lost both his front shoes in the cross-country on monday but still performed well enough to help her secure the medal			0
and in a tribute to the home crowd who sat in the rain to cheer her on , she added : ‘ it ’s incredible , it gives you a massive lift as you come into the arena			0
we ’re really grateful to everyone who has come			0
’ monday was the first anniversary of her wedding to rugby player @entity28 – but when asked if she had a chance to celebrate , she laughed and said : ‘ no ! ’ @entity4 was one of five members of the silver - medal - winning @entity14 equestrian team			1
by competing in the @entity15 , she follows in the footsteps of her @entity242 parents			0
