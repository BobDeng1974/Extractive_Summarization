’ the grilling of @entity0 by @entity32 ’s world at one presenter @entity31 was described as a ‘ car crash ’ interview			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity95 : would it be fair to say , looking at your plans overall , that you think that the government needs to borrow more now and that ’s in order to boost growth in the @entity102 : no , well [ what ] i would say is that we need to get borrowing @entity106 : in order to produce more growth , if you were pm at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more would n’t you ? @entity110 : well i do n’t accept that borrowing would be higher under @entity1 … because borrowing would be lower over the medium @entity112 : when @entity56 was asked about this very question he was more open			1
