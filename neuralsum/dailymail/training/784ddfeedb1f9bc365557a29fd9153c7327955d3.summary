it is fondly remembered as the most moving moment in the @entity2 - a momentary pause from the bloodshed , fighting and senseless deaths			2
and now , the @entity8 truce in the trenches has been re-created in a video game for the first time			1
the online game , @entity13 , set in the @entity2 , will give players the chance to stage a @entity8 truce by playing football and singing carols instead of the customary shooting			1
it even offers the opportunity to play football with friends online , simulating the real matches that broke out at @entity8 in the trenches , and throw snowballs			1
fighting will still be possible , as normal , but the developers have created sections of the game that players can go in to and enjoy the brief peace if they wish			2
there will be competitions to help keep the event festive â€” including prizes for the best video of the event or screenshots			0
the @entity65 was a series of widespread , unofficial ceasefires that took place along the @entity68 in @entity69 around christmas 1914			1
on @entity72 and @entity8 , many soldiers from both sides independently ventured into @entity73 , where they tentatively socialised to host joint burial ceremonies , several meetings and carol - singing			0

the battle , which lasted from 21 february 1916 until 19 december 1916 , led to more than 700,000 casualties ( dead , wounded and missing )			0
the @entity110 staged the attack in the hope of ' bleeding ' the @entity101 army to death and then targeting the @entity115 alone on the @entity68 , which could be brought down by @entity110 's submarine blockade			0
