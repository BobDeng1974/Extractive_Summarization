@entity0 has been banned from the roads after clocking up 54 points on his driving licence a driver who was allowed to stay on the roads despite clocking up 54 penalty points has finally been banned by a judge who admitted he has been ' lucky '			1
@entity0 was believed to be the only driver in the @entity8 to be ' legally ' on the road despite having more than 50 penalty points on his licence			2
the legal limit is 12 points , but a series of court mistakes allowed the 34 - year - old , who lost his job as a tyre fitter two years ago , to keep driving			1
the father - of - two , of @entity22 in @entity23 , has a string of offences to his name , including a one - year ban in 2010 for driving over the limit and and a 12 - month supervision order for admitting stealing petrol worth £ 500 from a string of garages last year			1
in november last year , @entity0 was handed 30 points - six points for five separate offences - after being convicted of driving a car with no insurance and stealing fuel			1
judge @entity39 , however , was unaware at the time of the previous 24 points already on his licence and @entity0 was allowed to keep driving after convincing the judge he needed a car to find a job			2
but yesterday he was finally banned from the roads for three years after appearing at @entity47 in front of the same judge			2
the judge 're - opened sentencing options ' on the case and banned @entity0 from the road for three years - as well as jailing him for 18 months after he admitted breaching a suspended sentence and possession of a knife			1
at the hearing in november , the court heard how @entity0 was caught five times driving without insurance on july 14 , july 20 , august 3 , august 10 , and august 28 last year - charges he admitted			1
he also admitted filling up with petrol in garages on four occasions - july 14 , july 20 , august 3 , august 10 - and speeding off without paying , stealing fuel worth £ 483			0
he was given a 12 - month supervision order , put under curfew between 7pm and 7am and ordered to repay the £ 483 to the garages he stole petrol from			0
the court heard how @entity0 was arrested in february this year for breaching his supervision order and curfew after being caught with a knife during a spat with a man at a caravan park			2
the judge took the opportunity to ban him from the roads			0
@entity0 , was , prior to his ban , thought to be the only driver with more than 50 penalty points , still on the roads			0
judge @entity39 ( left ) banned @entity0 ( right ) from the roads for three years at @entity47 judge @entity39 told the court that @entity0 had a ' head in the sand mentality ' and that he ' hoped the court order ( against him ) would be forgotten about '			1
in february this year , prosecutors tried and failed to get @entity0 banned after it was found that @entity0 already had 24 points on his licence before his appearance in court in november last year			1
but because the law states any variation in ' the substance of a sentence ' must be made within 56 days , it was ' too late ' to change the sentence he received at the time			0
prosecutor @entity99 told @entity100 in february : ' at the earlier hearing he was not disqualified , but in fact he should have been unless there was exceptional hardship			0
' unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now - he 's a lucky fellow			0
' judge @entity39 replied : ' a lucky man indeed			0
