' citing complaints about such behavior , @entity11 councilwoman @entity70 proposed a measure in the spring to completely ban alcohol at @entity13 and an adjacent beach during daytime lifeguard hours			1
that proved too broad for another group with authority over @entity11 's 26 beaches , the town trustees , a body established by @entity84 's royal governor in 1686			1
this week , ahead of the long @entity86 weekend that is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors , they came to an agreement : a 9am to 5pm ban on alcohol on the main 2,000ft stretch of the beach where most visitors congregate and lifeguards patrol during swimming hours			1
