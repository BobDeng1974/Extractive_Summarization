by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:15 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:11 est , 27 december 2013 if you 've ever spotted your waiter making odd gestures with their hands , they could be telling colleagues you 're a vip , a messy eater or be banning you from ever eating at the restaurant again			2
top restaurants are now teaching their staff to use a secret hand code to talk about their customers without them knowing			1
the @entity15 noticed the phenomenon and spoke to @entity17 , manager of @entity18 in @entity19 , who revealed his restaurant is often full of high - profile guests so staff make a sideways peace sign if a @entity4 comes in that needs special attention			1
mr @entity17 says this shaves seconds , or sometimes even minutes off the time it takes to serve people , making the dining experience more pleasurable			0
the most important aspect is still that the customer remains unaware of the gestures so it appears good service is effortless			1
in the interview with the @entity15 , he said : ' computers can only do so much as they 're stationary , service is happening at the table			2
help : but if a waiter makes a signal as though they are about to take an oath , they need assistance from other staff members a hand gesture to look like the letter ' c ' means the chef needs to be asked a question from a customer ' shaving off seconds and minutes you can communicate better with the guests			1
it enhances the experience and that 's what we 're here for			0
' but guests enjoying cocktails in the dining room at @entity77 in the @entity78 wo n't be asked if they want another round if restaurant director @entity80 touches the side of the gas candle on their table			0
and if a waiter at @entity85 in @entity86 starts brushing his shoulder as a guest leaves , that signals they were a messy eater and the table needs to be cleared quickly			2
@entity92 , an associate professor of food and beverage at the @entity95 at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , tells his students the value of staff using signals to improve a customer 's dining experience			2
he said : ' you canâ € ™ t yell across the dining room , " hey , i need help delivering food ! " ' the service experience is perishable			0
it begins and ends quickly			0
what happens at the table can make or break it			0
' hand codes in the restaurant trade have been around for some time			0
back in the 1940s , the owner of @entity117 's legendary @entity116 , @entity118 , would clasp his hands together and put one thumb up if a customer needed to be removed and banned for life			1
many restaurants use signals for a lot of their service - even to order drinks from the bar			1

top restaurants around the world teach their staff the hand gestures
the signals are used to make good service appear as though it is effortless
it can be used to order water , ask for help , signal a special *occasion* or an important guest has arrived
owner of @entity117 's legendary @entity116 , @entity118 used the secret code back in the 1940s
