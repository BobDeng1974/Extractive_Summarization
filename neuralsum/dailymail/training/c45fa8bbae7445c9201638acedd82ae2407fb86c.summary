the whole concept needs to be changed , the debate reframed			2
' i want the thing to fall as one complete edifice			0
if they manage to let a few white middle - class people off the hook , that 's very dangerous			0
if they can find a way for white kids in middle - class suburbia to get high without them going to jail and getting them to think that what they do is a million miles away from black kids taking crack , that is what politicians would do			0
' @entity13 claimed if marijuana were legalised it would mean another 10 to 40 years of ' assigning people of colour to this dystopia ' , the @entity21 reported			1
