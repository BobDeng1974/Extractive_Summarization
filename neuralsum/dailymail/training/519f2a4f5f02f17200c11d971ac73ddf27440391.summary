by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor tv show @entity2 is deterring people from building their own home because they think it must be a @entity6 ’s house constructed from ‘ yoghurt and goat hair ’ , a government minister has warned			1
@entity10 said self - build should be an affordable option for people struggling to get on to the property ladder			1
but the planning minister told @entity1 that it need not involve a ‘ funky architect ’ drawing up plans for dramatic dwellings which look like the ‘ @entity19 has landed on @entity20 ’			1
@entity21 's @entity2 , hosted by @entity22 , risks putting people off the idea of building their own home the government has unveiled a £ 150million fund to kickstart a wave of self - build across the country			1
the money will be used to provide up to 10,000 serviced plots which are ready to be built on , with water , sewage and power supplies , a dropped kerb outside and where archaeological checks have been carried out			0
the @entity37 says it wants to emulate @entity38 and the @entity39 where tens of thousands of people have built their own homes as an alternative to trying to raise the money for an existing property			2
a recent survey suggested one in seven @entity46 will research how to build a home for themselves within the next 12 months			2
but mr @entity10 insisted the homes do not need to resemble the ambitious and vastly expensive projects which feature on @entity21 ’s @entity2 – which often run over time and budget			1
planning minister @entity10 said he wants people to realise building their own home is an affordable option he told @entity1 : ‘ i love @entity2 , the programme , as much as anybody			1
' but what we need is not so much grand designs but affordable designs so anybody inclined to build a starter home can look at it as a mainstream option			1
‘ we need to get away from the idea that these things have to be made out of yoghurt and goats hair ; that unless it is something that is designed by some out - there architect and looks like a @entity6 house or @entity19 has landed on @entity20 , it 's not a grand design			0
‘ these builds can be essentially quite ordinary			0
they are probably going to be slightly more in keeping with a local area because they are not designed in some headquarters of a house building company miles away			0
‘ they are designed by a local builder for somebody locally			0
it 's not somebody just doing it to make money and run - there will be conditions attached to prevent that			0
’ under the new @entity89 to buy , local residents will be able to demand the council sell them a plot which has water , electricity and other utilities already connected			2
‘ it does n't need to be you laying the bricks or having a funky architect , ’ mr @entity10 said			1
‘ you can have something just a bit more personal , the number of bedrooms and so on			0
‘ you can actually save quite a chunk of money building yourself , even if you are not actually doing the work			0
’ the @entity89 to build will be consulted on this summer , with the law changed if the @entity107 win the next election			2
self - build projects can be cheaper than buying a starter home , and are more likely to be in keeping with the local area , mr @entity10 claimed in many countries , including @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , more than half of all homes are self - build projects but mr @entity10 hopes a few councils will act as ‘ vanguards ’ to trial the process before 2015			1
‘ this is an affordable option			1
the core idea is that if you live in a local area for a period of time , maybe two or three years , so you demonstrate some kind of local link , you would be able to put yourself on a list just like you would for social housing and say : i want a serviced plot of land with infrastructure and basic utilities on it			2
‘ the council would have a duty to offer you a plot within a period of time			0
’ he said the policy could be as revolutionary as @entity144 giving council tenants the right to buy their own council house in the 1980s			0
‘ when people used to approach councils saying we would quite like to buy our council house or council flat , they got a flea in their ear , ’ mr @entity10 said			1
‘ once the @entity159 government gave people a @entity89 to buy their council play if they fulfilled certain conditions then suddenly they flew off the shelves			0
it was a complete transformation			0
the idea is [ right to build ] would have a similarly revolutionary effect			2

planning minister @entity10 insists self build is an affordable option
insists @entity21 show has created idea it must involve ' funky architects '
@entity107 to give local people right to build , demanding plot from councils
