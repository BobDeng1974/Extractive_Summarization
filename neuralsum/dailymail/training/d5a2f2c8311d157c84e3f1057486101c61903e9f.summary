the majority of circumcisions are performed soon after birth men who are circumcised are in for some bad news - it puts them at a disadvantage in the bedroom , according to experts			2
a study found those who 've had their foreskin removed as children or adults experience less intense sexual pleasure and orgasm than their peers			1
' we 're not saying less sexual activity or satisfaction , but sensitivity , ' senior author dr @entity16 , from @entity17 , said			2
the practice is common in the @entity23 , with three - quarters of men having the procedure for non-religious reasons			1
however , it is rare in the @entity28 , with a rate of just six per cent , according to @entity31 figures			1
some religions , such as @entity33 and @entity34 , consider circumcision part of religious practice			0
@entity28 doctors say that although it can reduce the risk of some types of infection the risks associated with routine circumcision outweigh any potential benefits			1
the latest study surveyed 1,369 men over the age of 18 , who responded to leaflets handed out in train stations across @entity51			0
the men were asked whether they were circumcised , and were then asked to rate how sensitive their penis was , how intense their orgasms were and whether they experience any pain or numbness when they are aroused			1
overall , 310 men who took the survey were circumcised , and 1,059 were not			0
each rated how sensitive their penis was on a scale from 0 to five , with higher numbers being the most sensitive			0
for example , uncircumcised men reported an average sensitivity score of 3.72 when they or their partner stroked the head of their manhood compared to 3.31 amongst circumcised men			0
' it 's a significant difference , ' @entity16 said			0
uncircumcised men also reported more intense orgasms			2
male circumcision prevalence in 2007 : @entity72 is lower than 20 % , orange is 20 - 80 % and red is higher than 80 % one possible explanation for any potential difference in sensitivity is that a man 's foreskin may protect his penis 's head from rubbing against underwear and clothing			1
it 's possible , the researchers write , that friction makes the head of the penis thicker , drier and ultimately less sensitive			0
the researchers also found circumcised men were more likely to report more pain and numbness during arousal than uncircumcised men , which dr @entity16 said is likely due to scar tissue			0
' i 'm amazed that people report pain during sexual pleasure â€¦ that was unexpected , ' he told @entity102			1
however , dr @entity103 from @entity104 in @entity105 , who was not involved in the study , said : ' the medical evidence and the benefits of male circumcision are abundantly clear			2
' the @entity111 says the benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks , but stops short of recommending universal circumcision .			1

men who had foreskin removed reporting feeling less intense sexual pleasure
*75* % of men in @entity23 and 6 % in @entity28 have circumcision for non-religious reasons
@entity123 do *n't* routinely perform them saying risks outweigh benefits
