by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 last night suggested his relationship with @entity4 was the only reason he was found guilty of murdering @entity8 student @entity6			1
the 29 - year - old spoke out to @entity10 after an @entity13 court 's decision to reinstate his conviction in the 2007 murder and appeared to imply that @entity17 ’s unpopularity in @entity13 meant he was doomed to be found guilty again			1
' i 'm guilty just because in their minds i have to be guilty because i was her boyfriend			0
it does n't make any sense to me , ' he said on @entity25			0
upon her release @entity17 went back to her home in @entity36 , @entity37 and when the case went into retrial last year , she refused to return to @entity13			1
diplomats have said no secretary of state would ever extradict @entity17 back to @entity13 , but @entity13 @entity2 has attended the whole re-trial knowing there was a real threat he could be sent back to prison			1
' i 'm trying to be as positive as possible in a situation like this , ' he said			0
' it 's very traumatic , the situation here now			0
but on the other side , i still have to fight			0
i have chosen to be here and to fight against this ordeal			0
' misunderstanding : @entity2 dismissed reports he was trying to flee @entity13 this morning and claimed he was actually returning to the country after hearing the guilty verdict @entity2 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of @entity6 , pictured ' i do n't know what to think , because objectively , there 's nothing against me and nothing very strong against @entity4 , ' @entity2 added			1
@entity2 's sentence will not be imposed until the @entity13 @entity64 confirms it at a hearing next year			1
the day after the guilty verdict was announced , it seemed as though @entity2 was trying to flee the country when he was arrested 40 kilometers from the @entity69 border at a hotel in the @entity13 village of @entity72			1
but he told @entity25 that he went to @entity69 to celebrate the decision with his girlfriend , since he expected to be cleared of all charges and drove back into @entity13 ' as soon as i understood the verdict			1
' police apprehended @entity2 , pictured left , and his girlfriend - believed to be @entity79 , pictured right - at a hotel approximately 40 kilometres from the @entity13 border both @entity2 and his girlfriend cover up their faces as they leave @entity85 police station in @entity13			1
it is the first time @entity2 has been photographed in public since the @entity89 murder verdict was announced no escape : @entity2 is pictured as he leaves the @entity85 police station in northern @entity13 on friday company : @entity2 's girlfriend , believed to be named @entity79 , can be seen in the passenger seat @entity2 and his girlfriend left the police station on friday afternoon after officers confiscated his passport swarm : @entity2 , driving the @entity100 , was found by police near @entity13 's border with @entity103 and @entity69 @entity2 was apprehended by police at a hotel in @entity72 , in between @entity106 and @entity85 , north - east @entity13 , which are close to both the borders of @entity69 and @entity103 the @entity109 hotel in @entity72 , @entity13 , where police are believed to have found @entity2 with his girlfriend a typical room inside the @entity109 , pictured , where the couple were staying after @entity2 discovered judges had found him guilty of the murder of @entity6 on thursday – the day of the verdict – he left the court at 10:30am as the panel of judges went out to consider their decision			1
by the time they returned to announce the verdict , @entity2 was nowhere to be seen			2
his lawyer claimed he was still in @entity124 , but ‘ too stressed ’ to attend			0
while both @entity2 and @entity17 were re-convicted of @entity89 's murder last week , neither will be forced to serve time until the sentence is confirmed by an @entity13 @entity64			1
both parties are appealing the guilty verdict , and will remain free in the meantime			0
their case will again be heard in front of @entity13 's highest court , the court of cassation , which ordered the retrial earlier last year			1
the high court will be able to overturn the guilty verdict if it finds errors in the law were made by the lower court			2
both parties may have an advantage in their next hearing , following a misstep on the part of the presiding judge in the most recent case			0
judge @entity147 gave interviews to three @entity13 newspapers , commenting on the case just a few days before giving out her final decision			2
in one interview , @entity147 said @entity2 may have made a mistake by not testifying in the trial			2
however , @entity2 's lawyers point out that he was never asked to submit to a cross examination			1
they add that @entity147 's public comments show bias and taint the verdict			2
' the conviction is the result of a clear bias on the part of the judges against the defendants and in particular against @entity2 , and that interview proves it , ' his defense lawyer @entity161 told @entity169			2
in fact he and his girlfriend @entity79 , a 23 - year - old model , were already on their way to @entity13 ’s north - east border with @entity69			1
the pair had met while studying at the @entity177 and are said to have become close			0
miss @entity79 , who is from @entity178 , near @entity179 , has previously accompanied @entity2 on a holiday to @entity181 , where her parents now live			0
a @entity100 belonging to her father was spotted heading to the @entity13 - @entity69 border on thursday while the judges were deliberating the case of @entity2 and @entity17			1
the car was already 200 miles from @entity124			0
staff at the low - key @entity109 hotel tipped off the police , after recognising @entity2 as he checked in at 1am			2
at dawn he was taken to a police station in @entity85 where his passport was confiscated			0
he has been cautioned that he is forbidden to leave the country , ’ a spokesman for the police said			0
‘ his passport has been taken away from him and his identity card has been stamped to show that he must not leave @entity13			0
’ @entity2 told police he went on ‘ a little trip into @entity69 , then came back to @entity13 ’			1
according to reports in the @entity13 media , he added : ‘ i stopped there to rest			0
’ he later released a statement saying he had ‘ never thought of fleeing , before or now ’			0
@entity2 ’s lawyer , @entity161 , said his client had gone ‘ willingly ’ with police to give up his passport			2
the @entity124 court had ruled that there was a ‘ real and present ’ danger that @entity2 would flee the country and said he could not leave @entity13 again without permission from a judge			1
the judges said that although he had been present at some of the trial , @entity2 had shown an interest in obtaining ‘ logistical support in countries with which @entity13 does not have relations of [ mutual ] judicial assistance ’			2
in addition to holidaying in the @entity222 earlier in the case , @entity2 sought work in @entity225			0
but he was forced to leave when the authorities discovered his legal obligations			0

@entity2 's 25 - year sentence for the murder of @entity6 was reinstated by an @entity13 court last week
@entity2 's lawyer said ' stunned is an understatement ' when asked about his client 's *reaction* to the verdict on friday
the 29 - year - old will not have to serve his sentence until an @entity13 @entity64 confirms the decision
diplomats say it 's unlikely a secretary of state would send @entity2 's ex @entity4 back to @entity13
