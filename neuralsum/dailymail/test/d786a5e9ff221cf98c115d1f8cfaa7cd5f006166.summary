@entity1 manager @entity0 has complete confidence that his side will beat relegation			1
the @entity1 are gearing up for the final eight games of their @entity7 survival battle reinvigorated after a warm - weather training camp			1
@entity0 's squad - minus the four players on international duty - spent last week in @entity11 preparing for a run - in that begins with sunday 's tricky visit of @entity14			1
@entity0 believes his @entity1 side are more than capable of avoiding the @entity7 drop they have a tough battle ahead but recent performances - not least last month 's defeat of champions @entity21 - have given hope that a side rated as pre-season relegation favourites can escape the bottom three			1
the idea of a late - season getaway worked wonders last year , as @entity0 's men returned to secure a promotion spot and he hopes for a similar boost this time			2
the 43 - year - old said : ' last year we found it gave the lads a change and a change is almost as good a rest			0
we came back and we did the business by getting ourselves promoted			0
@entity40 man @entity40 will need to be in top form to get the better of the @entity14 defence ' it 's a different kind of challenge this time but we want the same outcome which is to win games and be in the @entity7			1
' wins have been hard to come by - or certainly harder to come by - and it 's a big jump in quality but i think slowly but surely we 're refocusing on what the job is , learning as we go and delivering good performances			0
' i have total belief we will be in the @entity7			2
' @entity55 ( 21 ) celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity21 at @entity57 @entity1 were written off by many after failing to win any of their opening 10 games but have since proved they are no pushovers			1
they remain in the relegation zone but were still just three points off 15th place ahead of the weekend fixtures			0
the @entity14 clash is followed by another tough task against @entity70 but @entity0 has no doubt his side will push hard			1
he said : ' i do n't know what they 're thinking ( about us ) but i think they know we 'll give everything to win a game			2
they know about the energy and physical desire of the team and behind that there is quality there			0
@entity89 has been the player of @entity14 's season and will need to be watched carefully on sunday ' of course that 's got to win games			2
we beat @entity21 but we need more of that , and it 's not always good play but a bit of luck , a decision to go your way every now and then			1
' i think our performances have been decent at least			0
we know they 're tough games and the next one will be @entity14 but we 'll be ready			0
' @entity0 has dismissed suggestions that his side , inexperienced at the top level , could start flagging as the heat intensifies in the coming weeks			1
@entity108 ( left ) challenges @entity70 star @entity109 during their clash at the @entity112 he said : ' last season there was no sign of that and this season there is no sign of that			0
' we will be playing hard in every game to get the points we need to be in the @entity7			2
it feels like there is no slowing down in what i believe , no slowing down in the training schedules			0
' we will be training equally as hard - if not harder on certain days - to be ready for the challenge			0
