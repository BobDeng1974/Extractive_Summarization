over a glittering football career , @entity0 won six @entity3 titles with @entity4 and won 59 caps for @entity6			2
yet despite a lifetime of sporting achievements that would be the envy of anyone , the 37 - year - old football ace - turned - pundit has been forced to admit he never learned to make a cup of instant coffee			1
@entity0 sensationally revealed he was caught out by @entity16 sports journalist who came to his house just before @entity18 for an interview			1
' when he replied coffee , my heart sank because i thought : " how do i do that ? " , ' @entity0 was quoted as saying by the @entity37			1
' i ran into the kitchen and i thought i am not going to poison this guy so i rang my wife			1
' the problem i then had was how much milk to put in			0
i forgot to ask my wife how much			2
' to be fair , he [ the journalist ] is still alive			2
' mr @entity23 's feature interview revealed how he sat in the football star 's living room at 11.30am on a monday morning and the former player told him he had just made coffee for the first time in his life			1
mr @entity23 told @entity52 today that the hot drink was up to scratch			1

‘ and @entity62 was there			0
“ come ‘ ere son , ” he says , and for the next hour he took me into all the different broadcasting boxes and introduced me to everyone			0
and then we sat down and talked and , without really knowing it , he gave me an hour ’s masterclass on commentary and working in the media			0
‘ ” what you need to do lad is get on that radio , ” he says			0
i thought he was trying to tell me i had a face for radio			0
‘ but he said , “ find your voice , get your confidence ”			0
and he made the point that it ’s that bit easier to make a mistake on the radio , because if you describe something wrong the guy driving down the @entity103 wo n’t know			2
there ’s a bit more of a safety net and a chance to gain some confidence			0
so i ’ve done loads of radio since then , and if there was a bit of lingering nervousness at the @entity31 it soon started to lift			0
