@entity0 is as dangerous as @entity1 and much more of a threat to world peace than @entity4 , a former defence secretary has claimed			1
@entity6 said mr @entity0 was more powerful than the jihadists in the @entity8 because he had a strong state and military to achieve his ambitions			1
the senior @entity13 mp called for the government to launch an urgent review of its military cuts and take a much stronger line against @entity20 expansionism			1
the mp made his stark assessment in an article for a @entity33 public affairs website called the @entity34			2
he said : ‘ no leader of a major power has behaved as overtly aggressively since @entity1 in the postwar period , and sadly @entity0 would be very pleased with the comparison			1
‘ he has said the demise of the @entity40 was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century and he claims the right to act on behalf of @entity20 minorities in other states			2
‘ as there are @entity20 minorities throughout the old @entity40 and far wider he is in principle claiming the right to interfere in the affairs of all of the independent sovereign states of eastern @entity51			0
‘ @entity1 's policies pushed the world into the cold war			1
@entity0 has the potential to be equally as dangerous			2
’ mr @entity6 , in remarks published in the @entity57 , said @entity51 needed to reduce its reliance on @entity20 energy			1
he said : ‘ the prime minister told the @entity61 recently there is no need to look at the strategic defence review of 2010 despite the fact that large scale cuts are still being imposed on our armed forces			2
’ the former defence secretary said : ‘ we have an army stuffed full of the kind of vehicles best suited to fight a counter insurgency in @entity75 , not those likely to offer reassurance to our @entity51 neighbours facing a @entity20 that is re-equipping its own forces			0
‘ these capabilities can not be altered simply or quickly			0
all party agreement should be sought for a new review now , this side of the election , to look at what can be afforded and the kind of training and equipment needed in the face of the new scenario			0
’ mr @entity0 - watching the launch of a missile during naval exercises in @entity20 's @entity95 on board the nuclear missile cruiser @entity98 - has ramped up military spending , threatening eastern @entity51 states the hard - man president has played up to his macho image to win support			1
@entity1 rose to prominence as an enforcer for @entity106 mr @entity107 slashed defence spending by 10 per cent in 2010 – but has vowed to increase the military budget between 2015 and 2020			1
last week , @entity110 , a former coalition defence minister , called for a new comprehensive strategy for dealing with security threats arising from @entity113 , the @entity8 and north @entity114			0
he said : ‘ since we completed our strategic security and defence review in 2010 , fundamental changes have taken place across @entity114 , the middle east and @entity113			0
‘ nothing calls more for a really serious new strategic defence and security review than the state of affairs at the moment			0
‘ i hope that the @entity126 , the @entity127 and other government departments will put time and effort into producing a strategy			0
