unbeaten @entity1 leaders @entity2 delivered a stunning knockout blow as @entity6 club @entity4 crashed out of the @entity7			1
the @entity8 twice came from behind in thrilling fashion to beat the @entity10 22 - 18 in front of a 6,358 crowd at @entity13 and stretch their winning run to 21 matches			1
the build - up to the fifth - round tie was dominated by the selection by @entity2 of former @entity18 forward @entity19 despite an agreement not to play against his old club , but he played little part in their downfall			2
unbeaten @entity1 leaders @entity2 delivered a stunning knockout blow as @entity6 club @entity4 crashed out of the @entity7 @entity19 , one of five @entity28 players in the home line - up , spent just 25 minutes on the field in two spells and looked well short of match fitness			1
instead it was left to former @entity35 hooker @entity34 to orchestrate a magnificent display by @entity38 's men , who trailed 6 - 0 and 18 - 12 to their @entity6 visitors , who were badly hit by injuries and indebted to a superb performance from @entity45 half - back @entity43 for keeping them in contention right to the end			2
the match was played amid a wonderful atmosphere and the ferocity was in evidence inside the first minute when @entity4 forward @entity53 was placed on report for a high and late tackle on @entity2 full - back @entity55			1
@entity43 opened the scoring after seven minutes when he dummied his way over for the first try and his half - back partner @entity60 kicked the conversion before hurting his knee in a collision four minutes later			0
@entity60 attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his injury and the @entity10 also lost centre @entity65 with a wrist injury before half - time			2
with @entity53 also limping , the visitors were rocked by the flair and determination of their @entity1 opponents , who scored two tries in four minutes to go 12 - 6 ahead			0
@entity34 was the provider each time , a short pass getting veteran forward @entity76 over from close range while @entity55 finished off his break from halfway , and @entity79 kicked both conversions			0
that was the signal for @entity82 to enter the fray but @entity4 turned the tables with two tries either side of the break from @entity88 to retake the lead			2
they drew level on 34 minutes when @entity43 broke clear to get the full - back over for his first try and got his over again three minutes into the second half courtesy of a neat reverse pass			0
@entity53 kicked both goals to make it 18 - 12 and @entity2 missed a glorious chance to level matters when centre @entity100 got winger @entity102 haring for the corner only for him to lose the ball in @entity43 ' last - ditch tackle			0
just when @entity4 seemed to be in control , the game took a new twist as @entity2 stormed back in front			1
they were thrown a lifeline on 63 minutes when @entity4 winger @entity113 's careless pass was snapped up by @entity2 half - back @entity114 for a gift of a try			1
@entity79 's third goal tied the scores and the @entity8 regained the lead three minutes later @entity55 fashioned a try for winger @entity122			0
there was no shortage of action right to the end but @entity2 , who pushed @entity127 all the way in last year 's quarter - final , hung on and just about deserved their famous victory .			0
