file picture cleaning up : the number of window cleaners has risen by 73 per cent , to 47,000 dr @entity64 , director of the @entity65 , said : ' our complex and fluid occupational structure explains why there are so many conflicting views on how the @entity0 way of work is changing			2
' from one perspective it 's clear that so - called ' knowledge work ' is firmly on the rise , requiring a high level of professional and technical skill and offering decent pay prospects			0
' yet equally apparent is a substantial bedrock of low skill , low wage service work which accounts for the @entity0 's relatively high incidence of low pay , with around one in five ( five million ) employees earning less than the commonly used low pay threshold for developed economies			0
' while with considerable justification we like to portray ourselves as a nation of increasingly better educated and skilled professionals , we could also reasonably be described as a nation of shop assistants , cleaners and restaurant or cafe washer - uppers			0
