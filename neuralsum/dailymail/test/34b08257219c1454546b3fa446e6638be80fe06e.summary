a pensioner who nearly choked to death on a pickled onion says his @entity3 saved his life – after jumping on his back to dislodge it from his throat			1
@entity8 , 67 , was tucking into his dinner when the pickled onion blocked his windpipe			1
he frantically tried to clear his throat , and after three minutes made his way to the door in a bid to get help from a passer - by			2
but he collapsed in his hallway and felt his life ‘ slipping away ’ as he began to black out – in front of his @entity18 and @entity19			1
he said : ‘ people will say they are only animals and do n’t know what they are doing , but @entity18 is so clever			0
‘ she saved my life most definitely			0
if it was n’t for her i honestly do n’t think i would be here			0
if it was n’t for her actions i would be dead – lying in that passageway dead			0
’ the pensioner had been tucking into his dinner when he began choking and had begun to feel his ' life slipping away ' @entity8 , who lives on his own in @entity22 , @entity44 , was tucking into an early dinner of crispbreads with gherkins and pickled onions when he started to choke last thursday evening			1
@entity18 , a rare red - coloured @entity3 , and ten - month - old @entity19 began to get agitated as he leapt up and tried to clear his airway			1
retired club singer mr @entity8 staggered into the hallway in an effort to get to his front door for help , but his legs gave way and he fell face - first towards the floor			2
but 18 - month - old @entity18 leaped into action and jumped with all fours onto the centre of @entity8 's back - dislodging the onion and saving her owner 's life he recalled : ‘ @entity64 i felt this almighty crash on my back			1
@entity18 had just jumped straight up in the air and landed right in the middle of my back			2
all of a sudden the piece of skin shot out of my mouth and i could breathe again			0
’ he added : ‘ my back hurt for two or three days afterwards – as did my throat – but i ’m fine now			0
i ’ve been spoiling them both since with treats , but every time i cough now @entity18 turns her head quickly			0

pensioner @entity8 's life was saved by his 18 - month old @entity82
the 67 - year - old began choking on pickled onion and felt life ' slipping away '
but @entity18 jumped on his back - dislodging the onion and saving his life
an earlier *version* of this *article* stated that @entity18 the *labrador* had saved mr @entity8 's live by performing the @entity98 manoeuvre . in fact , the dog jumped on his back to clear the blockage . @entity98 *involves* *applying* sudden , strong *pressure* on the *abdomen* , which was not the case in this *instance* . we are happy to *clarify* this .
