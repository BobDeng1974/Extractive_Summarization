by @entity1 reporter published : 21:39 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 20 february 2013 challenge : @entity3 left £ 200,000 to her daughters @entity5 and @entity6 when she died aged 80 but her son was left out of the will a bitter battle over a family will ended yesterday with the two sides spending more on lawyers than the £ 200,000 at stake			1
@entity3 left that sum when she died four years ago at the age of 80			1
but she had cut her son @entity16 out the will , leaving her estate to her daughters @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity16 managed to overturn that decision yesterday – but only at what a leading judge described as a calamitous expense			1
the hearing , which pitched @entity16 and @entity6 against @entity5 , lasted six days and called on 26 witnesses			1
@entity25 compared the case with the infamous lawsuit in @entity29 ’s @entity28 : ‘ it may be recalled that the foggy family law suit in @entity31 v @entity31 dragged on before the lord chancellor for generations until nothing was left for the parties to take			1
’ he said the only real difference was that the disappearance of mrs @entity3 ’s estate had ‘ happened faster than under the dilatory procedures of the unreformed @entity38 in the @entity31 case ’			0
he added : ‘ the cost of contesting mrs @entity3 ’s will is a calamity for this family in every way			1
even worse are the human consequences for a once close - knit and loving family			0
’ he said the rift between the three siblings was ‘ likely to be beyond repair ’			0
@entity5 , a former @entity52 magistrate , insisted her mother was of sound mind when she decided to write her son out of the will she wrote two years before her death in 2009			0
@entity6 and @entity16 , who runs a recruitment company , argued in return that their mother was in the grip of dementia and lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will			1
hearing : @entity65 ( left ) and his sister @entity6 ( right ) argued their mother lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will yesterday , the @entity70 came down in their favour , ruling that their mother had lacked ‘ knowledge and approval ’ of the will ’s contents and that – if her estate was not exhausted by the legal action – it should be split three ways			1
mrs @entity3 changed her will shortly after moving from her home in @entity52 to a nearby bungalow bought for her by her son			0
comparison : @entity25 compared the case with an infamous lawsuit in @entity29 's @entity28 she had decided to leave some of her personal effects to each of her children and also wanted to specify who should give the eulogy at her funeral and where her ashes should be scattered			0
@entity5 was with her mother when solicitors drew up the will , which included a clause that mr @entity65 would not receive anything from her estate , because of ‘ lifetime provision ’ she intended to make for him in the form of improvements to the bungalow			0
@entity16 and @entity6 instructed city solicitors and a top @entity102 to challenge the will , pointing to an @entity106 professor ’s evidence that their mother may have been confused and suffering from a ‘ moderate ’ disorder of the mind at the time			2
@entity25 said he ‘ entertained doubts ’ as to whether mrs @entity3 in fact lacked the mental capacity to make the will – but nevertheless ruled it invalid on the grounds that she had not fully appreciated the document ’s impact			2
the judge , sitting with @entity120 and sir @entity121 , said @entity5 and @entity16 had fallen out before the document was signed			2
however he remained close to his mother until her death , without her telling him about the new will			0
under mrs @entity3 ’s previous will , signed in 1996 , her estate was split three ways and that will now take precedence			0
@entity5 was ordered to pay her siblings ’ legal costs			0
ruling : the @entity70 came down in the favour of @entity16 and @entity6 , who challenged the will , ruling that their mother had lacked ' knowledge and approval ' of the will 's contents			2

@entity3 left sum to daughters @entity5 and @entity6
her son @entity16 was left out of the will but he managed to overturn decision
@entity16 and @entity6 pitched against @entity5 at six - day @entity149 hearing
@entity25 described the case as a ' calamity for the family '
