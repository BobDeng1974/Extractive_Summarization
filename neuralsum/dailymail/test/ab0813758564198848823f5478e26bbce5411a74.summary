prince @entity0 will tonight fly out of the @entity1 to @entity2 without seeing his new niece or nephew a disappointed prince @entity0 will tonight fly out of the @entity1 to @entity2 without seeing his new niece or nephew			1
with the @entity6 now overdue for the birth of her second child , the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid may			1
@entity0 , who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival , had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the @entity15 after undertaking several engagements in @entity17 to mark the centenary of the @entity20 campaign			1
he was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess			1
but with @entity6 now several days overdue , @entity0 is being forced to return to @entity2 where he is on a month - long placement with the army , followed by a week long official tour of @entity28			1
instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew , @entity30 , who turns two in july , at the @entity32 's apartment at @entity33			1
@entity6 and her husband , prince @entity34 , had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by saturday , according to sources			2
@entity42 – whose son , @entity30 , was also around a week late - herself told well - wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due ' mid to late april '			2
when @entity30 's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the @entity33 and @entity53 social media accounts on @entity54 and @entity55			2
details of their arrival – including their six , birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside @entity53			2
@entity42 – whose son , @entity30 , was also around a week late - herself told well - wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due ' mid to late april ' @entity0 had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the @entity15 after undertaking several engagements in @entity17 ( pictured ) to mark the centenary of the @entity20 campaign the mounting tension saw bookmakers ' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby 's name – and even their hair and eye colour			1
prince @entity0 will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head			1
@entity101 customers appeared to favour @entity102 for a boy , with odds collapsing to 8/1 , and @entity105 remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4			0
some were still hankering after @entity109 ( 14/1 ) , in memory of @entity34 's late mother , or even @entity112 in honour of the @entity114 ( 6/1 )			0
the firm said one male customer in the @entity118 area had bet £ 10,000 on the new baby being a girl , the largest single wager so far received			0
spokesman , @entity121 , said : ' as far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome princess @entity105 into the family			0
' @entity126 said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today ( monday ) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10 - 1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week			0

prince @entity34 and @entity6 pose with their son @entity30 at the @entity142 in @entity143 preparations have been made outside the @entity68 of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the @entity6 said to be up to four days overdue as the ' spare to the heir ' , it is unlikely that the duke and duchess 's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of			1
most recently the @entity114 's own father became @entity155 when his elder brother , @entity156 , unexpectedly abdicated over his love for ' unsuitable ' @entity159 divorcee @entity158			0
thanks to recent changes in the law of succession , if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne can not be superseded by a younger brother , should @entity34 and @entity6 go on to have a third child			2
she will also be known as hrh princess ( forename ) of @entity32 after the @entity114 altered a century - old ruling in the run up to @entity30 's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a @entity34 ( as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children ) was entitled to the honour			1
the new arrival will also bump prince @entity179 out of the ' top five ' for the first time			2
he will drop to sixth in line to the throne			0
his eldest daughter , princess @entity184 , will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the @entity114 's approval for her marriage			0
her younger sister , @entity188 , will become eighth			0
if the baby is a girl it will be the first princess of @entity32 to be born for 182 years			1
@entity6 has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl			0
@entity197 prince @entity34 has said he would like a girl – while his late wife , @entity109 , @entity109 , always longed for a daughter .			0

prince @entity0 will fly out of @entity1 tonight to continue placement in @entity2
this means he will not be able to meet royal baby until return in *mid-may*
he will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival
duchess of @entity32 is several days overdue for birth of second baby
