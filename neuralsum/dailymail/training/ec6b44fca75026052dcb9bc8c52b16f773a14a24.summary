by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 28 january 2013 @entity2 has attempted to pacify jittery gun - owners by talking about his love of clay pigeon shooting			1
the president 's words will be seen as an attempt to reassure conservative voters who are angry about his plans to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws			1
in a soon - to - be published interview with @entity17 , president @entity2 is asked whether he has ever fired a gun			2
he said : ‘ yes , in fact , up at @entity20 , we do skeet shooting all the time			1
and i have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations			1
' and i think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake			0
’ the president 's plans for tighter firearms regulations were drawn up by vice president @entity45 and include a ban on military - style assault weapons and a 10 - shot limit on the magazines of weapons			2
they are a response to the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at the @entity57 elementary school in @entity58 , @entity59 , last month			0
tough sell : @entity2 faces strong opposition to his proposed new gun laws , despite which he says he has a ' profound respect ' for the nation 's history of hunting with firearms however , president @entity2 told gun control advocates they need to do ' a little more listening ' as he discussed his stance on assault weapons			1
' part of being able to move this forward , ' president @entity2 says , ' is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas			2
' according to the @entity78 , the president says in the interview that he has a ' profound respect ' for @entity82 's long tradition of hunting with firearms			1
he pointed to this history as the reason many gun rights advocates are so protective of their constitutional right to bear arms			0
the proposals to change gun laws have been made in the aftermath of the @entity57 massacre ' if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were ten , ' the president said , ' and that became part of your family 's traditions , you can see why you 'd be pretty protective of that			1
' @entity2 referred to the gap between urban and rural views on gun ownership as ' part of the biggest task over the next several months ' in his fight for public support of his assault weapons ban			0
' and that ' he says , ' means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes			0
' earlier this month , the president signed 23 executive actions aimed at tightening gun laws			0
these do not require congressional approval			0
gun rights advocates like those at the @entity119 , who say @entity2 's move to overhaul gun control will only affect honest , law - abiding gun owners			2
long battle : @entity2 's gun laws are unlikely to be passed through the @entity127 - dominated @entity126 and both sides say they are prepared for a drawn out battle ' attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation , ' the @entity119 said in a statement after @entity2 signed his order alongside vice president @entity45 and several children who wrote him letters asking for greater gun controls			1
@entity2 has also asked congress to renew the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , restrict magazines to no more than 10 rounds , and expand background check requirements to cover gun conventions and private sales			0
the interview will appear in the february 11 issue of @entity17 .			0
