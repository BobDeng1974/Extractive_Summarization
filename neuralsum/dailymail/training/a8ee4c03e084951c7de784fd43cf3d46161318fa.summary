by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 7 june 2012 as wedding scenes go , it is a rather sedate affair			0
but four women who joined in the celebrations are thought to have paid with their lives			2
they are feared to have been the victims of honour killings after dancing with men			0
scroll down to see the video footage four of the five women believed dead after tribal elders condemned them to death for dancing and singing in scenes from the wedding , they are pictured in heavy robes and headdresses , sitting on the floor while singing and clapping			1
two men were apparently dancing next to them , while out of shot another person captures the moment on a mobile phone video camera			0
soon afterwards , the women were said to have been shot or had their throats cut for breaking local customs that prevent them from dancing with the opposite sex			2
another woman , said to have been ‘ an accomplice ’ , was also allegedly executed			0
last night officials in @entity33 were travelling to the remote north - western village of @entity35 to investigate the claims			1
a tribal council of clerics – known as a @entity40 – reportedly condemned the women to death for ‘ fornication ’ and staining their families ’ names			1
their actions were said to have brought shame on the community , which frowns on men and women dancing together or fraternising at all			2
two men were also condemned to death for dancing with the women but they escaped and told a judge the women had already been killed but local police say the footage does not show the men and women in the same room together			1
three teams of police have visited the area , which is two days ’ walk from the nearest road , while local government officials have denied the claims , saying the women are alive			1
the two men dancing in the video , named as brothers @entity68 and @entity70 , appeared in court yesterday charged with creating conditions for tribal violence			0
@entity33 ’s @entity74 has asked for the women to be produced before them in the capital , @entity77 , but it was told the weather was too bad for them to make the 100 - mile journey			1
the chief secretary of @entity82 , the province where the incident is said to have happened , argued that local laws did not allow women to travel in male company or face questions from a male judge			2
the fifth woman to have been executed is believed to be the sister of one of those in a video taken of the dancing five @entity96 women killed for dancing and clapping at wedding but a judge told him either to get a helicopter or troops to ensure the women were alive and said that if he refused , the judges would go to @entity35 themselves			2
mr @entity68 and mr @entity70 told chief justice @entity105 that the women had been slaughtered			0
their brother @entity107 said up to 50 people had been sent by the @entity40 to kill the women			0
outside court , he added : ‘ all the five girls – @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and one more – [ have ] been killed by the jirga on may 30			0
i have four witnesses of the killing			0
’ the @entity121 of @entity33 said at least 943 women and girls were murdered last year for allegedly defaming their family ’s honour			1
the statistics highlight the scale of violence suffered by many women in conservative @entity33 , where they are frequently treated as second - class citizens .			1

local officials say the women are alive but refuse to present them to the @entity74
