when @entity1 turned 50 two years ago , he planned to mark his half century birthday by jumping out of a plane and parachuting to the ground			1
but his worrywart wife , @entity5 , put the kibosh on his plans , fearing he ’d end up with the one parachute that would n't open			2
so when @entity1 found out about a place where he could actually experience the adrenalin - charged sensation of making that leap , only in a totally safe environment , he jumped at the chance			1
birdman : @entity1 was all set to go sky - diving two years ago on his 50th , but @entity5 grounded her country star husband			1
but where there 's a will there 's a way suspense ! @entity1 comes in for landing aided by instructor @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 ‘ @entity1 was all set to go sky - diving two years ago on his 50th , but @entity30 had a fit when she heard about his birthday plans , ’ says a source close to the couple			1
‘ she pleaded with him to stay grounded , and not wanting to upset her he agreed			0
then last month , when he and @entity30 were in @entity26 , @entity27 for their @entity35 with @entity5 , someone in his camp told him about this place called @entity25 where , after just a brief training session , you can experience what it feels like to jump out of plane			1
' he was gung - ho to give it a go , ’ says the friend			0
‘ @entity1 tried to convince @entity5 to join him but she was n’t interested , however a few of his crew members were anxious to take the plunge , so he treated them all to the $ 69.95 session , which allowed them to experience two , 60 second jumps and receive a certificate saying they ’d done the deed			2
' hanging out : @entity1 took a leap of faith thanks to @entity25 instructors @entity56 , @entity24 , @entity57 and @entity58 do n't do it ! @entity5 was sure hubby @entity1 's parachute would fail if he did the real thing the facility , located just a couple miles from where @entity5 and @entity1 performed , uses the same type of fans that are used by the military when they train their paratroopers			1
‘ the @entity25 experience is made possible utilizing a technology called the “ vertical wind tunnel , ” which was historically used by military and professional skydivers for training , ’ @entity69 ’s spokesperson , @entity68 , tells @entity70 exclusively			2
four powerful , high - efficiency axial fans are mounted at the top of the building , channeling air down the side tunnels into the basement , and then up through the floor through a 14 - foot - wide circular flight chamber , creating a strong upward draft			0
‘ this column of air , which ranges in speed from approximately 80 to 175 miles per hour ( depending on the weight and expertise level of the flyer ) , creates a stable , safe , wall - to - wall airflow that gently pushes guests aloft and makes it possible for them to fly			0
@entity1 and his friends put on flight suits , goggles and helmets , and they had a great time , ’ says @entity68			0
' @entity1 happily posed for photos and signed autographs , and we certainly hope to see them all back again soon			0
