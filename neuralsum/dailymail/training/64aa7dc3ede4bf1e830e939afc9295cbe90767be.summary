by @entity0 hope : the prime minister said he aims to increase devolution after the 2015 general election @entity4 has warned left - wing parties they will ‘ reap what they sow ’ if they punish @entity8 with higher taxes			1
writing exclusively in today ’s @entity11 , the prime minister says he will ‘ seek support ’ from other parties to deliver the biggest shake - up of devolution after the 2015 general election			1
his predecessor @entity17 also paved the way for a formal cross-party pact on devolution yesterday as he argued that @entity21 is united on the issue			2
if there is a no vote in september , the @entity8 conservatives have proposed giving @entity26 full control over income tax , allowing them to raise and lower each rate			1
the party also wants to give @entity31 a share of the vat raised in @entity8 , the ability to increase welfare payments and control of housing benefit			1
@entity38 wants the @entity39 to be in charge of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax , and be able to increase higher bands – but not lower them unless all levels are reduced			2
the party also believes there should be the power to create a new council tax band , allowing the @entity50 to introduce a ‘ mansion tax ’			0
the @entity52 favours a ‘ progressive ’ tax system and could use the new powers – if there is a no vote – to hammer higher earners			2
but mr @entity4 writes in today ’s mail : ' you can be sure that @entity8 conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low - tax , pro-enterprise policies within a @entity39 with enhanced responsibilities			1
' if the parties of the @entity66 want to argue for higher personal taxes for @entity8 compared to the rest of the @entity69 , then let them reap what they sow			1
' agreeing to disagree : @entity4 ( right ) and @entity8 's first minister @entity71 ( left ) sign the scottish independence referendum agreement at @entity73 in @entity74 he adds : ' the @entity76 report [ on further devolution ] is a clear , coherent and @entity79 blueprint for the next stage of @entity8 ’s devolution journey			1
we will take them forward in our 2015 general election manifesto and seek support to deliver them in the new parliament			1
' all the mainstream @entity89 parties believe in further devolution , so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation , there is no reason why these changes should n’t happen early in the next parliament			2
' mr @entity17 said : ' it is definitely possible now to see an agreement about extra tax powers and extra policy powers for the @entity39			2
' so the argument that the @entity52 have been putting across over these last few months that nothing will happen if there is a no vote in september is completely wrong			2
' i believe in devolution because i ’m a conservative , not despite being one			0
two principles that i hold dear are that governments have a responsibility carefully to spend public money ; and that where possible decisions should be taken as close to the people affected by them			0
these two principles are at the heart of the @entity118 ’ proposals for improving @entity8 ’s devolution settlement , outlined this week by @entity121 and strongly supported by me			1
the @entity122 is a clear , coherent and @entity79 blueprint for the next stage of @entity8 ’s devolution journey			1
we will take them forward in our 2015 @entity128 and seek support to deliver them in the new @entity39			1
all the mainstream @entity89 parties believe in further devolution , so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation , there is no reason why these changes should n’t happen early in the next @entity39			2
the @entity39 already runs schools , hospitals and other vital services and decides how to spend two - thirds of all public expenditure in @entity8			1
however the @entity39 has to date had little responsibility for raising the money it spends			0
we have started to put that right			0
in 2012 the @entity149 passed legislation to give the @entity39 more responsibility for funding @entity8 public services			2
the @entity76 recommendations go further			0
under these proposals the @entity39 would have the power to decide how to fund up to half of what it spends			0
these are real powers with real consequences			0
for the first time the @entity50 and @entity26 in @entity31 will be accountable for how much of your pay packet stays in your wallet and how much goes to the tax man			0
and when you buy goods or services in @entity8 , the report says a share of that money should stay in @entity8 , to make up part of the @entity50 's budget			2
it gives the @entity39 a greater stake in supporting a thriving economy			0
and you can be sure that @entity8 conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low - tax , pro-enterprise policies within a @entity39 with enhanced responsibilities			1
if the parties of the left want to argue for higher personal taxes for @entity8 compared to the rest of the @entity69 , then let them reap what they sow			1
it is the conservatives who are delivering on devolution			0
we are at the heart of the constitutional debate			0
we do n’t just talk a good game – we lead and we act			0
a referendum in @entity195 to give its assembly new law - making powers - delivered			1
the recommendations of the @entity199 – the biggest act of fiscal devolution to @entity8 for over 300 years - delivered			1
first time tax powers to the @entity203 – being delivered			0
@entity204 deals to enhance local democracy – being delivered			0
but there ’s more to do – and we have a plan for the future			0
and the people of @entity8 understand that the only threat to devolution is @entity71 and his separation plans			1
they know that opportunity to take domestic decisions within @entity8 whilst retaining the strength , security and stability of being part of the @entity69 is the best of both worlds			2
@entity121 has charted a very clear course for the future of the country she loves			0
she has my wholehearted support as together we seek to build an even stronger @entity8 with our @entity69 family of nations			1
we delivered on devolution in this @entity39			0
we will deliver in the next .			0
