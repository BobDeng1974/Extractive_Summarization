@entity1 's experimental use of @entity2 on the wing may be short - lived after a match where he was unable to emulate the explosive impact he had from midfield seven days earlier			1
@entity8 was asked after this defeat if the ploy would be repeated next week and said : ‘ we ’ve got to assess the game			0
‘ we wo n’t make any decisions until wednesday next week			2
overall , the back - line created opportunities as a group ; the disappointment is that we were n’t able to finish them			0
but three tries in @entity20 is not a bad return			0
’ deft : @entity2 holds off two @entity24 defenders to hand off for @entity25 to go over forward surge : @entity2 is stopped by @entity27 as he powers toward the try line late rally : @entity25 goes over for @entity1 's third try in @entity20 proud : @entity8 ( right ) praised his players for scoring three tries against @entity24 @entity2 did make a telling contribution at the end of the match , when his back - hand off - load sent @entity38 clear and paved the way for @entity25 ’s try , but prior to that there had been ample proof that he is not a bona fide winger			1
the most obvious example came just before half - time when @entity2 broke clear on the right but lacked the pace to finish off the chance he created			2
time and again , the @entity24 sought to target him and , while the 23 - year - old ’s defensive resolve was not in question , every kick behind him equated to a flurry of panic in @entity56 ranks as he set about the unfamiliar routine of turning and tracking back under pressure			1
overall , there was just an over-riding sense that one of @entity1 ’s primary attacking weapons had been somewhat marginalised , which suited @entity24 far more than the tourists			2
breakaway : @entity2 sprints away from the @entity24 defenders but is caught short of the try line pros : @entity2 helped to set up a try , created a scoring opportunity for himself , made six tackles — three more than last week — and showed an increasing hunger to go looking for the ball as the game wore on			1
cons : he was less heavily involved — he had 10 runs , three fewer than in the first test — and lacked conviction when the ball was kicked in his vicinity			0
he was also unable to take his scoring chance .			0

@entity24 *continually* looked to exploit @entity2 's defensive *weaknesses*
@entity2 *struggled* to make impact but played vital role in @entity25 's try
