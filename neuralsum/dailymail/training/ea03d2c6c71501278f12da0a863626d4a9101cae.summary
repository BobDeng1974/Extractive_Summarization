my @entity0 were the magical equine toys introduced in 1983 to the delight of small girls around the world			2
now the childhood classic is back - and it 's found a surprisingly masculine ( and much older ) fan base second time around			2
meet the ' bronies ' , an 80 per cent male group of @entity11 fans , who love the toy and the tv spin - off so much , they spend their lives dressing up as their equine heroes			1
the mane event : bronies dressed in colourful equine - inspired outfits outside the @entity20 brony convention the bronies , most of whom are aged between 18 and 35 , also express their love for @entity11 by writing poetry and fan fiction , creating pony - themed avatars and by attending conventions , one of the largest of which is held in @entity31			1
now a new documentary has gone behind the scenes at @entity20 , the @entity35 brony convention that attracts hundreds of @entity11 fans living in the @entity35 and @entity37			1
one regular attendee is ' @entity39 ' , the 23 - year - old head of the ' @entity42 ' bronies , who hails from @entity44 and says he loves everything about @entity11			1
' 16 to 25 year old males watching a show about ponies from a little girl ’s show in 1985 ... ' he muses			1
' you ’d normally think that that would be weird			0
' but then i am weird myself , so i mean i watched it and i loved it and i can understand totally why anyone would get behind it			0
' dressing up : a brony dressed as a male version of princess @entity60 ( left ) and another with his favourite pony inspiration : @entity11 was originally launched in 1983 as a toy for small girls but now has broader appeal boys ' club : the @entity70 fandom is 80 per cent male with female bronies known as ' @entity70 ' ' it ’s innocence , it ’s fun , it ’s colourful , it ’s , you know , it ’s a nice escape from the grey world as it were for the time being and it brings me joy , ' says 48 - year - old brony , @entity80			1
' it ’s something i like to share and if i can share something good and , you know , make people happy , then great			0
' others say the sympathetic story lines covering issues such as friendship and fitting in is what most appeals to them			0
' it ’s not just about world problems , just about simple problems , ' says one			0
' it 's things like having no friends , trying to find friends , finding out about friendship is magic			0
' ' @entity11 ' , the strapline for the @entity11 cartoon relaunched in 2010 , is something you hear about a lot during a visit to buck and for many bronies , neatly encapsulates why they love the show so much			1
cheers ! as with the tv show , the brony slogan is @entity11 and making friends their purpose entertaining : most bronies , seen here with presenter @entity113 , got into it after seeing the 2010 cartoon exciting : during @entity20 , bronies enjoy @entity118 sessions and workshops , and get to meet likeminded fans ' for me it was ironic at first , ' says ' @entity123 ' , a teenage brony			1
' but then i kind of got into it , you know , i appreciated the message within it			0
' it ’s got decent values to go by and you do n’t find that on tv much anymore			1
' while it 's easy to see why sympathetic tales of friendship featuring strong female characters might appeal , what 's harder to understand is the ' cosplay ' element of bronydom			2
although not every brony feels the need to dress up , others choose to express themselves via colourful costumes , many accessorised with horns , that reference their favourite pony character			1
' @entity70 usually only dress up during meet ups or conventions to celebrate their mutual fandom , so it 's not unlike a comicon event , ' explains @entity154 , who produced the upcoming episode of @entity156 with @entity113 that features the bronies			1
' this is not @entity160 syndrome but a passion for a show that symbolises friendship amongst those who often find it hard to make friends			2
avatar : @entity168 dressed as his avatar , @entity170 ( left ) , and fellow brony @entity171 as princess @entity172 magic ! presenter @entity113 with brony @entity168 ( left ) , dressed as his alter ego , @entity170 quirky : @entity70 @entity177 as his avatar , @entity179 and right , bronies watching a show ' often these young men spend much of their social interaction online and following the rerelease of the cartoon in 2010 , the unlikely and often lonely fans found each other thus creating this subculture			1
' we ’re very accepting of everything , because you know , people come from all walks of life here , ' adds @entity196			0
' at the end of the day we do watch a little girl ’s show			2
' and in an echo of @entity154 's comments , more say becoming a brony has given them a sense of security as well as a place where they feel accepted and fit in			0
' a lot of people [ at @entity20 ] , i kind of feel would have very low self - esteem on a normal day , ' explains one			1
' they find it hard to make friends , and this is where they feel comfortable			0
they can interact with people , they can talk with people and it gives them a confidence boost			0
they feel as if they ’re a part of something			0
' ' the fandom simply wants to find like - minded people whom they can become friends with , ' adds @entity154			0
' at the end of the day , it 's all about their key message : friendship is @entity233			0
' the bronies appear on outsiders with @entity113 , friday at 10pm on the @entity236 .			2
