a furious mother has slammed the @entity1 after her ' fit and active ' 11 - year - old son was sent home from school with a letter branding him overweight			1
@entity6 , 35 , was stunned when her son @entity7 arrived home from @entity9 in @entity10 with a letter advising he needed to make ' lifestyle changes ' to get to a normal weight			1
it came after @entity7 and his his classmates were measured at their school as part of the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
furious @entity6 ( left ) has slammed the @entity1 after her ' fit and active ' 11 - year - old son @entity7 ( right ) was sent home from school with a letter branding him overweight ms @entity6 said her son was an ' extremely fit and active boy ' , and said categorising children as overweight or obese is ' disgraceful ' health staff recorded the weight and height of each pupil before the sending the findings to parents to tell them what category they fall in to			1
ms @entity6 was then informed that @entity7 , who is 4ft 9in tall and weighed six - and - a - half stone , was in the overweight category , according to @entity1 scales			1
she describes the results as ' disgraceful ' and would cause some children to develop an eating disorder			1
' i feel hurt for him and all the other children who are labelled overweight or obese , ' said the mother - of - two			1
@entity7 and his his classmates were measured at their school as part of the @entity18 ( @entity42 ) ' the sad thing is that these days , unless you 're stick thin , you 're automatically classed as overweight			1
' it 's not fair and certainly not good to be encouraging children to think like that when all you hear is that eating disorders are on the rise			2
' i think it 's disgraceful that children are being categorised in this way			1
i 'd say he 's perfectly proportioned actually			0
' yet just because of his height and weight he 's labelled overweight			2
' the @entity18 measures children in reception class and @entity59 and takes into consideration their age , height and sex			0
children are then given a letter to take home , telling their parents or carers what category they fall into , and what lifestyle changes they could make , should they wish to			1
if @entity7 weighed just 3lbs less or was one inch taller than he would have been classified as ' healthy ' but ms @entity6 says he already fits into this category			1
' he eats healthily , including his five fruit and veg a day , ' said ms @entity6 , who also lives with her partner @entity75 and their daughter @entity76			2
' he also eats a lot of homegrown things , including home - reared meats			2
' he 's an extremely fit and active boy			0
he plays a lot of sport , bikes everyday , goes fishing everyday and is generally always outdoors			0
' @entity85 , lead nurse for the @entity18 in @entity10 , said she recognised the programme can be a ' sensitive topic '			2
she said : ' we would like to reassure parents that , along with trusts across the country , the @entity18 team uses a nationally accredited @entity1 measure to establish a child 's weight status , taking into consideration their age , height and sex			0
' this information is then shared with parents or carers who are offered further support to make any lifestyle changes they may wish , which is entirely voluntary			2
' we do recognise this can be a sensitive topic and would encourage parents to contact us if they wish to discuss any aspect of their child 's health			0
' a spokesman for @entity115 said the programme was part of a national scheme			0
she said : ' this is a national screening programme which all schools are involved in			0
' children in @entity7 's class at @entity115 in @entity10 ( pictured ) were weighed and had their height measured @entity124 , spokesman for the @entity125 , said the @entity18 was designed to be used for statistical use , and should not be used to inform children that they are overweight			1
' it 's not a precise measurement , ' he told @entity130			0
@entity131 is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying			0
medics use a modified @entity137 scale with children that takes account of their age and sex			0
one in three children in @entity143 is classed as ' overweight ' according to official government figures			2
children are classed as either underweight , healthy weight , overweight or very overweight			1
according the @entity148 : ' it can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age			2
that â€™s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure			0
' research shows that if your child is overweight now , they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult			0
this can lead to health problems in later life , so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing			0
' ' there are many children who have their parents informed by letter that they are overweight and the parents are furious because the child is of build that is not overweight for their stature			1
' the letters sent out are a combination of a mail merge between computer data , and there needs to be the intervention of a school nurse - who as a human being is far better equipped to decide if a child is overweight			1
' when the parent has the letter they can decide how valid it is and if it is valid the parent needs to be careful how he or she transmits the information to the child			0
' it is quite possible that the child could be given the wrong message			0
' @entity196 should never go on diets , they need all the nutrition they can get and being told they are overweight could have tragic consequences			0
' i hope parents will provide their children with sensible advice and make sure the child does not dwell on the letter , but gets all the good things like the right food and exercise			1
' i would think in this case the parent would be furious and this is the danger of the child measurement programme - it was never designed to be a clinical programme , but was intended as a statistical tool			0
' ms @entity6 was informed that @entity7 , who is 4ft 9in tall and weighed six - and - a - half stone , was in the overweight category , according to @entity1 scales			1
