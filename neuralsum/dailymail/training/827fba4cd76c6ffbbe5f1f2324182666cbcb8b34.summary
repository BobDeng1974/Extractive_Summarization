by @entity0 for @entity1 the megarocket @entity4 is developing to take man to @entity6 is so loud it could damage nearby buildings and even astronaut 's hearing when it takes off , the space agency has admitted			1
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
@entity4 has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud			0
' a 5 - percent scale model , including solid rocket motors , of @entity4 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is ignited to test how low - and high - frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad , ' the agency said			1
' the data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket 's sound suppression system			1
' previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges			0
' this may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand			0
' a @entity4 report warned			0
the sls is set to become the largest rocket ever built , dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to @entity6			1
@entity4 today said it is about to start testing the engines for the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the @entity57 rockets			1
four engines , a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011 , will be used on the mega-rocket			2
' this test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for sls that are different than the space shuttle , ' said @entity71 , @entity72 manager			2
earlier this year @entity4 signed a $ 2.8 billion contract with @entity74 to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space			2
' our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) – the largest ever - will be built safely , affordably and on time , ' said @entity79 , @entity11 vice president and program manager			2
a 5 - percent scale model , including solid rocket motors , of @entity4 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is ignited to test how low - and high - frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad			1
' we are passionate about @entity4 ’s mission to explore deep space			0
' it ’s a very personal mission , as well as a national mandate			0
' this milestone marks @entity4 ’s first cdr on a deep - space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961 , when the @entity94 rocket underwent a similar design review as the @entity96 sought to land an astronaut on the moon			2
scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017 , the @entity11 is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs			1
the biggest rocket ever made : the @entity11 will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds there will be two versions of the rocket			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity11 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			2
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
the initial flight - test configuration will provide a 77 - ton capacity , and the final evolved two - stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons			0
the rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the @entity123 , and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system			0
' the potential use of @entity11 for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration , ' said @entity132 , astronaut and associate administrator for science at @entity135 in @entity136			0
' @entity11 has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos			2
' currently under construction , @entity4 ’s @entity11 will be the world ’s most powerful launch vehicle			1
designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations , including an asteroid and @entity6 , @entity11 is working toward a first launch in 2017			1
for that first flight test , the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons ( 77 tons ) of payload into low - @entity154 orbit , almost three times what the space shuttle could carry			1
from there , @entity11 will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry			1
' while many people think of the space launch system in terms of human exploration , @entity11 could have a wide application in a lot of other areas , including space science , ” said @entity169 , assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for @entity11			1
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity173 rockets than launched man to the @entity175			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity179 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity179 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway @entity4 's previous rockets , the @entity173 , @entity183 and right , the smaller configuration of the new @entity11 ' for missions to the outer planets , for example , @entity11 could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible , such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times			1
' agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft , such as the @entity199 , a proposed mission to one of @entity203 's icy moons , on the @entity11 rocket , and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system ’s outer planets , rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed , reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles			1
in the case of the @entity199 , for example , the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles			0
' for as long as people have been launching rockets into space , mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width , ” @entity169 said			0
' depending on how large you make it , it can only go so fast , which in some cases limits where you can go			0
' today , if you want to send a mission to the outer planets , you have to be able to make it fit within that box			0
with @entity11 , we ’re about to make that box much larger			2
an artist 's impression of the vast hanger needed to set the rocket up for flight ' with the space shuttle , for example , we were able to launch missions like @entity4 ’s @entity249 that were about the size of a school bus			1
' with @entity11 , you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried @entity249			1
' it ’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions			0
' ' the space launch system could be really game - changing for space science , ” said @entity261 manager @entity260			2
' for some missions , it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out			0
' a @entity6 sample return mission , for example , could be flown using only one rocket instead of three			2
' but for other destinations , @entity11 lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of @entity173 ’s moon @entity275			0
