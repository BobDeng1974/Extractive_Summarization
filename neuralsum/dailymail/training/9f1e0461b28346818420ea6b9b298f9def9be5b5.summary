on a cold and rainy november morning , farmers @entity0 and @entity2 waded arm - in - arm into the large soggy paddock that 's home to their @entity6 , nearly 250 gobbling , barking , and bumbling @entity9 turkeys			1
the husband - and - wife team that owns and operates @entity11 , a 200 - acre spread nestled in @entity13 's @entity12 , began catching the birds by hand days ahead of the year 's busiest market week			1
together , with their two young children close by , they worked around the clock to slaughter and dress the animals before a four - hour drive south to @entity23 's @entity22			1
there , loyal customers eagerly awaited their organic , non-gmo fed gobblers			1
the work is back - breaking and time is short , but for the farmers it is worth it			2
' the market for me , that 's my reset button , because it can get so stressful and overwhelming and exhausting , ' said @entity0			1
' we go to the market and we have people who bring their families to come meet their farmers			2
it is like an extended family			0
it sounds cliche and hokey , but it really does become that			0
you know a lot about your customers and they show you pictures and they know your kids ' names			2
' buyers say knowing the people who grow their food makes a difference			0
' when you shop at the same vendor for the same thing all the time , you start to develop a connection , ' said @entity87 , one of @entity11 's regular and enthusiastic customers			1
' i get an email every year , three weeks before @entity9			0
. @entity0 has my email address , and many other people 's too , but it feels personal , and she sends an email and it says " ok we 're starting to take deposits for turkey now , " and i do n't get that email from @entity96 ... and i would n't give my email to @entity96			1
' but bottom line is the taste			0
is fully - pastured fresh turkey really all that different ? ' i originally tried one of their chickens and it was probably the best chicken i 've had , ever , and so i started shopping for chicken from them and then they offered turkeys that first year			2
i ordered one , and the rest is history , ' said @entity87			0
' i buy my turkey from them every year			0
even if i travel for @entity9 , then i just cook @entity9 early on the saturday before			0
' choosing the meal : @entity0 , owner of @entity11 , grabs a turkey by the leg as they are harvested for @entity9 bye bye birdie : @entity0 , owner of @entity11 , butchers a turkey as it is harvested for @entity9 perfect cut : @entity0 , owner of @entity11 , butchers a turkey 's feet as it is harvested for @entity9 family business : @entity2 , right , and @entity0 , center left , stand at their @entity22 market stall with their infant daughter @entity33 as customers arrive to pick up their @entity9 turkeys			1
