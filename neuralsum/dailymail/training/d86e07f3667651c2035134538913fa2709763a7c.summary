the incoming @entity3 manager is now focused on @entity11 — but is expecting @entity3 to act decisively over the next few weeks , with the club also closing in on @entity14 left - back @entity15			0
all three moves are fraught with problems , with @entity18 unwilling to sell @entity19 , while @entity8 , who also interests @entity20 , and @entity21 will be difficult to prise from @entity22 due to their long contracts			2

@entity28 converted @entity7 from an attacking wide player into a holding midfielder , then he plucked @entity8 from @entity22 ’s youth squad and made him a mainstay of his team			2
both players have enormous respect for the @entity47 coach and would be happy to move to @entity3 if they feel their careers are stalling under @entity30			0
