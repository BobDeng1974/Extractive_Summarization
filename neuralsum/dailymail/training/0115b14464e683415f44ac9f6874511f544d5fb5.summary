by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor vice president @entity2 publicly conceded on wednesday what many critics of the @entity4 have claimed : the federal government will end the @entity4 open enrollment period far short of its goal			1
' we may not get to seven million ; we may get to five or six , but that 's a hell of a start , ' @entity2 said during a speech in @entity13			1
' i 'm here to say thanks			0
' the @entity16 has estimated that in order for the @entity4 system to avoid a financial ' death spiral , ' at least 7 million @entity17 must enroll			1
more importantly , the nonpartisan @entity16 projected that more than 2.7 million of them must be @entity17 , whose limited use of health care services is expected to balance out the greater needs of older , sicker people			1
the goal of 7 million new insurance customers has been embraced by members of @entity29 , the @entity30 , and @entity31 secretary @entity32			2
@entity2 , shown earlier on wednesday in @entity33 , said the administration will fall far short of its @entity4 enrollment goal @entity2 's appearance at @entity38 's cafe , a brief stopover before a major @entity41 fundraiser , marked the first time the @entity44 administration has walked back its health insurance enrollment goals by offering new numbers , although the independent @entity16 reset its estimate at 6 million this month			1
@entity48 , the @entity30 press secretary , has softened the president 's position in a different way during recent media briefings			2
' when it comes to predictions about how many people will have signed up come march 31st , i do n't have an exact number , ' he said on february 12			0
' what we are confident about is that that will be a large number , and it will be a population that is diverse enough to allow the marketplaces to function effectively			0
' last week the @entity63 announced that total enrollment through january stood at 3.3 million , but the administration has refused to say how many of them have formalized their coverage by paying a first - month premium			2
a @entity70 analysis of five states that do provide such numbers determined that just two - thirds of the total , or 2.2 million , are likely coverage by insurance			2
@entity30 press secretary @entity48 has pivoted in recent weeks , focusing less on the total enrollment goal and more on the ' diversity ' of enrollees needed to balance the system between the sick and the healthy and a @entity82 survey of more than 4,500 @entity4 enrollees in january found that just 11 per cent of them were uninsured before signing up			1
about two - thirds of those surveyed said they were merely switching from employer - provided coverage			0
@entity4 's original goal was to provide medical insurance for approximately 25 million uninsured @entity17 , out of the estimated 48 million who were uninsured in 2012			1
so far , a large majority of those who have enrolled chose free @entity94 coverage rather than a private plan that would require a premium payment , a government subsidy , or both			0
@entity2 , however , enjoys a concierge - style health plan provided by doctors in the @entity101			1
and , he said wednesday , he 's taken full advantage of it			0
' i 've been a significant consumer of healthcare , ' he told the crowd at the cafe , ' and i 'm not bragging about it			0
' while he was hospitalized for two brain aneurysms , he said , ' all i kept thinking about was , " thank @entity110 i had all this insurance			0

the vice president told *supporters* that ' we may not get to seven million ; we may get to five or six '
the @entity16 has estimated that seven million new @entity4 enrollees are needed to financially support the system
without enough money from insurance premiums , *economists* say , the @entity4 's risk pool will go into a ' death spiral ' of *unpaid* costs
@entity2 was in @entity13 talking to about 100 supports in a cafe before *speaking* at a major @entity41 fundraiser across town
the vice president , the president , and their families enjoy top - shelf health care provided by @entity101 physicians at *taxpayer* expense
