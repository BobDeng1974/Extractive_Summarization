by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 17:10 est , 3 september 2012 coal miners who attended a @entity3 rally last month in the critical swing state of @entity5 are angry are being ' forced ' to attend the event - and even missed out on a day 's pay			1
@entity9 coal mine in @entity10 closed on august 14th - the day of the @entity14 presidential nominee 's event - citing security concerns			1
mr @entity3 held his event at the mine , as he effectively used it and the hoards of soot - faced miners in coveralls and hard hats as props during his speech about the financial and political benefits of increased coal mining			2
grip and grin : @entity3 met with coal miners at an august 14th event in @entity10 , @entity5 and their plant was closed for the day because of ' security ' concerns pressured : after the fact , a number of the workers complained that they felt like they would lose their jobs if they did not attend , and they all automatically lost a day 's pay because the mine was closed a number of the miners called and emailed complaints to a local radio host who aired their grievances , which come as close connections have been revealed about the mine 's owner and the @entity3 campaign			1
' they took a roll call and took a list of who was there and who was n't , ' radio host @entity50 said on @entity58 1170			0
it was n't only the fact that by closing the mine for the event the workers lost out on a day 's pay , but they also thought the nature of the event itself was insensitive considering their difficult economic situation			1
' at the event there were jugglers , there were rides there was a brand new golf carts - that a lot of expense had been put out and they felt that with the layoffs at one of the other mines , they thought it was uncalled for , ' mr @entity50 said			0
the @entity81 reports that when asked to comment , the mine 's chief operating officer @entity82 said ' @entity84 was mandatory but no one was forced to attend '			2
' we are talking about an event that was in the best interest of anyone that 's related to the coal industry in this area or the entire country , ' mr @entity82 continued			0
mutual interests : @entity95 is a strong supporter of coal and the mine 's owner has contributed heavily to @entity14 campaigns over the past several elections insensitive : the workers also complained that a lot of money was put into the activities at the event which seemed inappropriate since so many mines are struggling to keep their workers employed he added that workers lose a day 's wages when the mine is closed for whatever reason , including bad weather or power outages			1
the radio host stood by his decision to read some of the emailed complaints he received , which paint a picture of the forced compliance that the company exerted on its employees over both events like the august 14th one or other campaign dinners in the crucial electoral college state			0
' just for the record if we did not go , we knew what would happen : then we would have to make up time or pay was short			0
there are lists that go around if you are the good people or the bad people , that means if you go to these dinners or not , ' one email read			0
' at this point i need my income , jobs are hard to find , but it is wrong what we are made to because of the outcome if we do n't			0
' mr @entity50 agreed , telling the @entity146 : ' if they shut the mine down , why should they lose a day 's pay ? there are some guys that just want to go to work , feed their family and go home			2
' @entity155 , the owner of @entity9 's century and parent company @entity157 , and his wife have contributed the federal limit of $ 5,000 each to @entity3 's campaign , not to mention $ 471,185 to a plethora of @entity14 candidates and politicians since 2008			1
and those contributions are only a fraction of the total donated to various @entity14 political action committees by @entity9 subsidiaries , who the @entity172 reports gave a total $ 1.5million during the same time span			0
given @entity3 's strong support of coal and coal expansion as a part of his proposed plan to make @entity183 energy independent by 2020 , the monetary ties to the @entity14 campaign come as little surprise			1
true support in @entity5 is going to be critical come november , as the latest poll released sunday by the @entity187 has the president and @entity3 tied at 45 per cent of the respondents .			2

@entity191 closed for @entity3 event in @entity5 and workers lost a day 's wages
the owner of the mine is a regular contributor to @entity3 's campaign
workers said they felt pressured to attend or else they would ' be fired '
