by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 01:34 est , 30 may 2012 @entity1 will today launch its flagship smartphone , taking the fight to @entity4 with the most pre-ordered gadget in history			1
and while all eyes are on the launch of @entity1 's hardware , the @entity8 tech giant launched another salvo against @entity4 with a competitor to the @entity16 's long - established @entity15 media store			1
the @entity17 is the successor to the @entity20 phone , which helped make @entity1 the world 's largest smartphone maker in 2011			1
the phone , sporting a 4.8 - inch screen , features eye - tracking technology so that it knows when to wake and when to sleep , and quad - core processors which give it the kind of computing power top - range pcs had just a few years ago			0
it also comes with @entity1 's take on @entity4 's ' @entity34 ' voice control system , and @entity35 of cloud storage thanks to a hook - up with the file - sharing service @entity39			1
first look at the @entity44 centre for the @entity17 phone @entity52 , senior vice president for @entity1 's media department , said : ' @entity1 is not known for our content services ; we make good hardware products but we have n't done much in the content space but that 's changing			1
' we are doing it to create a better experience for our users			0
there are things we could do better if we have complete control over all of the service			0
' speaking to expert mobile site @entity65 , he said : ' we want to have the largest catalogue			0
we want to be bigger than @entity4			1
' the company has previously rebranded existing music and video services on its devices , where they compete with music stores from the likes of @entity75 and @entity76 and streaming services such as @entity78 and @entity79			0
@entity80 at @entity81 said the mobile phone was increasingly at the heart of a lot more media consumption , and @entity4 had established a formidable lead			1
' a lot of the other players are still trying to find the magic formula that can use to counter @entity15 , ' he said			0
critics have raved about the model , calling it ' light years ' ahead of the nine - month - old @entity16			0
a spokesman for @entity97 @entity96 said : ' in the two years that we 've been offering pre-orders , it 's the @entity1 sold 44.5 million smartphones in january to march - equal to nearly 21,000 every hour - giving it 30.6 percent market share			1
@entity4 sold 35.1 million iphones , taking 24.1 percent market share			1
' the @entity17 is a real challenger to the upcoming @entity16 , ' said @entity106 , an @entity107 analyst based in @entity108			0
' this is likely be one of the most sold smartphones this year , though the real test will come when the next @entity16 is launched			0
' @entity15 is the entrenched champion of media distribution , with deals with all the major content labels to let people get movies , tv and music on to their @entity121			0
@entity15 currently has 20million tracks available to download - but @entity1 have done a good job at catching up , with 19million traks available			1
both devices allow you to purchase tracks at a range of prices , but in terms of the ' all you can eat ' offers , @entity1 allows you to pay £ 9.99 a month to stream music over the air , and download tracks for offline use			1
it also offers 100gb of personal space where you can upload tracks you own which are not on @entity1 's platform			1
but @entity15 ' ' all - you - can - eat ' model comes in a lot cheaper , at less than £ 25 for a year 's worth of streaming - although without offline access			0
however , as a first release , this is an interesting and well - considered development for @entity1			1
@entity15 is both much - loved and much - hated			0
loved for its ease of use , but users often complain that they are locked into @entity4 's eco-system , and struggle to get @entity148 - purchased material onto their @entity121			2
music hub is so far only available on the @entity17 , but @entity1 says it will be rolled out to other @entity1 devices - including their brand of @entity152			1
if @entity1 gets a critical mass of supporters , it will be interesting to see long - term how this matches up to @entity20 's generally ' open - access ' philosophy , and whether @entity44 will eventually be accessible from other @entity20 devices - and how other manufacturers such @entity158 , which has its own fledgling @entity161 , will respond			2
the race for global smartphone supremacy comes as @entity4 has accused @entity1 of copying some of its products			1
the @entity8 company counter-claims that @entity4 has infringed its patents			2
both have denied the allegations , and a long - running court saga continues			0
@entity4 plans to use a larger screen on the next @entity16 , according to people familiar with the situation			2
the current @entity175 model was introduced last october			0
reviewers have praised the @entity17 as the best phone on the market , outclassing its competitors - and even beating the @entity16 at its own game			0
@entity181 said ' if you 're picking up an @entity175 : forget it ' and @entity183 concluded ' the @entity17 is light years ahead of @entity4 's profitable darling '			2
and @entity186 said the @entity17 has succeeded in ' toppling @entity4 's ageing starlet '			2
in fairness to @entity4 , their latest phone is now nearly nine months old - a lifetime in the fast - moving mobile world			2
the next @entity16 is rumoured to arrive in october at the earliest - but @entity4 are notoriously secretive .			0
