the coin was tossed and i was sent to @entity2 where the title could have ended up			2
it did n’t stop the fans giving us ' visitors ' the usual atmosphere before and after the game			0
you do n’t need to have played the game to realise that defensively the @entity11 have n’t got it quite right yet			0
but are all their defenders no good ? was @entity16 part of the problem ? and the celebration of @entity20 ’s deeper role does n’t take into account the possibility that change might have weakened the team defensively			1
so let ’s assess those points			2
bear in mind that @entity28 want to get even better – they ’ve had an excellent season , but @entity30 wo n’t want to stand still			1
safe hands ? @entity16 is an excellent shot - stopper , but his distribution needs work an own goal put @entity37 in front , @entity35 should have made it two when he burst clear , and even when the visitors had players sent off there were times when the @entity28 back four looked like they could crack at any moment			1
why ? @entity30 plays a 4 - 3 - 3 as his preferred tactic , and two of that back four are attack - minded fullbacks			2
if that system is going to work , you need at least one world class centre half , ideally two			2
@entity52 and @entity53 do n’t fit the bill in my view – not for the domestic and @entity58 glory @entity28 should be aspiring to			1
you can get away with one of them over a season but not both , not if you want to be champions			0
i ’m sure most @entity28 fans would agree when i say they still have n’t replaced @entity63			1
@entity16 has had a decent season , i do n’t think goalkeeper is a position that @entity30 needs to address			0
@entity68 has had an unexpectedly brilliant season and should n’t be discarded ; but i suspect @entity70 ’s 11 minutes from hell at @entity72 will have set alarm bells ringing at @entity2			1
double trouble : @entity53 ( left ) and @entity52 can both be replaced @entity75 : @entity70 ( no 2 ) was found wanting as @entity72 scored three goals in nine minutes to derail their title charge leader : @entity79 clutches the @entity81 trophy for the second time in three years if you look at why @entity84 pipped @entity28 to the title , it is n’t because @entity20 slipped over , or because @entity84 have rich owners – only the most shallow and basic football debaters would think that			1
it ’s because they had some superb players , led by the main man at the back – the kind of central defensive rock most successful teams have			0
@entity79 showed everyone what a quality footballer and leader he is during the run - in			1
without him you always felt @entity84 were weaker			1
he ’s so brilliant he ’s even made @entity102 looked good			2
if @entity28 can go and find a @entity79 , they have a chance of firmly establishing themselves back at the very top level where their fans feel they belong			1
good luck finding him though			0
this is a manager who headbutted an opposition player on the touchline during a game			0
so a disciplinarian he is not			0
a point highlighted by the fact he shook @entity122 ’s hand when the striker was sent off , and patted @entity124 on the head when he saw red			1
regardless of whether these two players deserved to go ( i thought the @entity124 red was ridiculously harsh ) the manager has to deal with that situation better when he ’s the most public face and figurehead of a football club			1
@entity122 was barking non-stop at the referee which is why he saw a second yellow , so is @entity137 happy with that ? and while @entity124 should n’t have gone in my view , his foul was cynical and worthy of a yellow			1
is @entity137 patting him on the head for that reason ? no self - discipline : @entity137 ( right ) protests at @entity2 as a miserable season ends in defeat for @entity37 whatever he says to the players in the privacy of the dressing room , the manager of @entity37 can not be seen to be condoning ill - discipline on the touchline , especially given his actions earlier this season			1
there are some positives to @entity137 ’s management – when his teams are playing well they are a joy to watch			1
he achieved good things at @entity162 , and @entity163 before that			0
but after a disappointing spell at @entity166 , he has been given a fantastic opportunity at a club with huge potential			0
he ’s not making the most of his incredible good fortune to be in the hotseat at @entity173			2
his reputation right now is that he is a manager with no self - discipline			1
he ’s setting that tone for his players , too , it seems			0
has it been a good season for referees or not ? they get the blame from managers who want to deflect from their own errors of course , so a lot of the things they ’re criticised for are n’t actually legitimate			2
i ’d rather talk about football than referees , but my one criticism of the men in the middle this season is that i ’ve seen too many who simply do not watch the game closely enough			0
@entity198 was the referee at @entity2 on sunday and for me he summed up the problem with referees this season			0
i think he is one of the better refs and actually i do n’t think he had a bad game			0
the man in black : @entity198 brandishes red to @entity124 but i do n’t know what he saw in the @entity124 challenge to regard that as a straight red , rather than a yellow			2
it was n’t a clear goalscoring opportunity , it was n’t serious foul play – studs were n’t high , he was n’t airborne and out of control – so i just ca n’t understand what @entity198 saw in that incident			0
what was he watching ? @entity198 ’s other fault was that he was too willing to ' buy ' free kicks won by @entity222			0
i like @entity222 a lot , and some would call it clever when mid-chase with ball at feet , he will ' bump ' into the opponent tracking him – he throws a shape which necessitates contact with his man and goes down			0
he did it for the free kick that led to the winning goal			0
it ’s surprising @entity198 did n’t watch it properly , if he had he would n’t have been deceived			0
if it was my club i would n’t be bothered about @entity222 ' winning ' free - kicks – we all know how the heart rules the head when it comes to football			2
so if @entity222 does it for @entity243 , good luck to him ! but if he does n’t win a free kick , that will be a referee doing his job properly			0
going to ground : @entity222 ( left ) battles with @entity251 on the @entity198 also had no reason to disallow @entity254 ’s brilliant early free kick : he was n’t even looking so he could n’t possibly know the ball was rolling , if indeed it had n’t stopped moving by the time @entity254 connected			1
that was a referee spoiling a special moment in a game because he was n’t watching what was going on ; instead he was too busy being mates with a @entity37 player and having a chat			0
simple advice for refs – watch the game closely			0
you ’ll make fewer mistakes			0
there was something very fitting when , with @entity28 lacking the craft and guile to get back on level terms with @entity37 , @entity254 running around like a headless chicken , and pot shots reigning in from 30 yards going nowhere , up stepped the @entity28 captain yet again to drag his team to victory			1
@entity20 is a stunning player			2
his set - piece delivery is still way ahead of anyone else in the @entity81 , and his free - kicks led the @entity11 to victory			0
well into his thirties , @entity20 has this season captained a team that has gone from seventh to second , he has excelled in a new position , helped instill discipline into @entity254 , and been the perfect example of a brilliant captain			1
he also skippered his country to @entity291 qualification unbeaten , and scored the goal to seal a trip to @entity294 in the final group game			0
so near and yet so far : @entity20 saw his @entity81 title dream shattered put all of those things together and @entity28 do n’t get close to second spot without him			1
that ’s why he pips @entity254 for me			1
and too many bandwagon - jumpers started shouting about @entity302 once they realised @entity84 were going to win the title			1
@entity302 has had another excellent season and made a massive contribution to @entity84 ’s title success			1
but you ca n’t be player of the season if your manager sees fit to take you off for tactical reasons when you only have a slender lead at @entity313			0
the fact that @entity84 held on to their advantage means the manager was right , and @entity302 was n’t needed			2
that would never happen with @entity20			2
i hope @entity20 ’s imperious form continues to the @entity291			1
i sense people foaming at the mouth and dribbling on their keyboards muttering : ' what about when he slipped over and gave the ball to @entity325 ? ' everyone can make a mistake , but the saddest part of that is not that it cost @entity28 the title , but that it really is all @entity331 have got to celebrate this season .			1

@entity28 **'s** defence is what cost them the title
@entity52 and @entity53 are not a good enough pairing to compete in the @entity339
@entity84 skipper @entity79 showed his class all season
@entity137 shaking @entity122 ’s hand and patting @entity124 **'s** head showed he has no self - discipline
@entity20 should have pipped @entity254 to @entity349 awards
