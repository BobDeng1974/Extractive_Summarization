by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:07 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 20:35 est , 7 november 2013 among his bed - hopping exploits with @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , it was perhaps a fleeting footnote			0
but the night @entity9 fled a woman ’s flat trouserless after her husband walked in on them naked on the sofa must surely rank among his most embarrassing			1
it seems the episode is one the unlikely lothario would rather have kept to himself , as it was not included in the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 or @entity24 version of his autobiography , serialised in the @entity27			0
quite an own goal : @entity9 promotes his autobiography , the @entity30 version of which accidentally contains the story about how he was once caught naked with a married woman but the story did make it into the @entity30 edition			1
the former @entity37 manager was caught in the act after a night out in @entity39 with @entity40 , a former player from @entity20 team @entity42 which @entity9 managed earlier in his career , and an unnamed female friend – who left with him			2
‘ we soon found ourselves naked on the sofa , ’ wrote @entity9			2
‘ she had not said anything about having a husband , but suddenly the door opened and there was a big man who said : “ who the hell are you ? ” i said : ‘ i better leave , ’ and he replied : ‘ i think it ’s probably for the best ’			1
’ couple : the affair between @entity61 and former @entity37 football manager @entity9 has been well - documented - especially by @entity7			2
but in his explosive memoir , @entity9 lifts the lid on his side of their turbulent romance @entity9 left the flat dressed in only his underpants and shirt , leaving his jacket , trousers , wallet , mobile phone and size 6 shoes behind			1
he found a size 11 pair of basketball shoes in the stairwell as he fled			1
‘ i had to take them , ’ he wrote , adding : ‘ i wonder what would have happened if a photographer had seen me , walking around in nothing but a shirt with basketball shoes seven sizes too big ? ' that would probably have created a few headlines			1
’ to make things worse @entity9 woke up the next morning in the wrong hotel			0
staff there had recognised him and given him a room even though he had no money or credit card to pay the bill			0
the next day they located where he was supposed to be staying and helped him make a discreet entrance through the hotel ’s garage			0
@entity9 said on wednesday that the story was published ‘ by mistake ’			0
his editor @entity104 told a @entity20 newspaper : ‘ we took bits out and put bits in			0
the @entity30 have not taken this out			0
they ’ve simply messed up and we are very sorry for this			1
