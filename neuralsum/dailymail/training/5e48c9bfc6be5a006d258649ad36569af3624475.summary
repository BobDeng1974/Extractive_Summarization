two centuries after handkerchiefs were dipped in the blood of the beheaded @entity5 king @entity4 , scientists believe they have proved one such rag kept as a revolutionary souvenir contains his bloodstains			1
for years researchers have been trying to verify the claim that an ornately decorated calabash contained a blood sample of the king , who was guillotined in @entity16 on january 21 , 1793			1
on that day @entity16 @entity17 joined the crowds as dipped a handkerchief into the blood left at the scene of the decapitation			1
beheading : @entity4 was killed in 1793 , as depicted in this painting of him being led to the guillotine by @entity25 study : blood found in the gourd , right , was compared to dna of the mummified skull of @entity31 , left , which found a genetic link he is then believed to have placed the fabric in the gourd , which has been in the hands of an @entity38 family for more than a century , and had it embellished			1
two years ago , analysis of dna taken from traces of blood found inside the gourd revealed a likely match for someone of @entity48 ' description , including his blue eyes			2
but it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have dna of any royal relation			0
but a team of experts from @entity5 and @entity57 , which has published its findings in the journal @entity60 , have conducted further research using genetic material from another gruesome artefact - a mummified head believed to belong to @entity48 ' 16th century predecessor , @entity31 their research has uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations , and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process			1
@entity5 forensic pathologist @entity75 said : ' this study shows that ( the owners of the remains ) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line			0
proof : the research has proved the authenticity of the gruesome artefacts of both the blood sample of @entity4 , left , and the mummified head of @entity31 , right ' they have a direct link to one another through their fathers			1
' the revolution in which @entity48 and queen @entity92 lost their heads in public executions also saw mobs ransack the royal chapel at @entity97 , north of @entity16 , hauling ancient monarchs like @entity31 from their tombs and mutilating the remains which they tossed into pits			0
research : the results of the study were published yesterday and presented during a press conference earlier in december an individual was recorded to have rescued a severed head from the chaos			2
@entity110 thought to belong to @entity31 , assassinated at the age of 57 by a @entity113 fanatic in 1610 , the head changed hands several times over the next two centuries , bought and sold at auction or kept in secretive private collections			0
scientists in 2010 said they found proof that the head was indeed @entity31 's , citing physical features that matched 16th century portraits of the king , as well as radiocarbon dating , 3d scanning and x-rays			1
the 2010 study , however , found no dna and its findings have been contested by some			0
with the new evidence , ' it is about 250 times more likely that the ( owners of the ) head and the blood are paternally related , than unrelated , ' according to co-author @entity136 of the @entity138 in @entity139			0
he said it would be ' extremely surprising ' if the remains did not belong to the two monarchs , when all the physical and forensic evidence was taken together			0
mr @entity75 said : ' one can say that there is absolutely no doubt anymore			0
' the dna data obtained from @entity4 could now be used to decipher the genetic code of @entity5 's last absolute monarch and his living relatives .			2

research solves *220* year mystery of @entity4 remains in calabash
handkerchief dipped in blood of beheaded king kept in gourd since 1793
scientists compared @entity128 in gourd with mummified head of king 's *ancestor*
