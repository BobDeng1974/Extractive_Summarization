by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 17:26 est , 15 march 2014 it is a stark choice : whether to suffer the agonies of the lung disease cystic fibrosis , or risk getting cancer after accepting a donor lung from a heavy smoker			1
as @entity11 revealed last week , doctors want the lungs of such smokers to be offered more widely to transplant patients in a bid to boost the number of lifesaving operations taking place			1
currently , a third of those on the waiting list die before organs become available			2
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) argues that despite the cancer risk , cystic fibrosis sufferers should be given the option of having ‘ reconditioned ’ organs , which could come from a smoker or those with other diseases			2
@entity33 sufferer @entity31 , 23 , from @entity34 would rather risk with smoker 's lungs after waiting for two years for a transplant and one @entity39 patient , @entity31 , is certainly willing to take the risk – because for the 23 - year - old , time is running out			1
the average life expectancy for someone put on the lung transplant list is two years – the exact time @entity31 has been waiting			1
‘ i ’d rather risk lung cancer in five years ’ time than stay in my current situation , ’ she says			2
‘ i ca n’t afford to be fussy			0
i do n’t know how long i ’ve got left – it could be six months			0
’ @entity31 , who dreams of a career in fashion , currently spends two weeks of every month in hospital receiving intravenous antibiotics to halt the infections attacking her body			1
she is also reliant on more than 60 different medications a day , and needs to sleep with an oxygen mask at night to help her breathe			1
‘ right now , i do n’t have a life , ’ says @entity31 , from @entity34			1
‘ if smokers ’ lungs would give me a half decent life for a while , i would take them			2
on bad days it feels as if i ’m drowning as i ’m constantly gasping for breath			0
‘ i ’m dying but there is a chance i could live longer with a smoker ’s lungs			1
is n’t that what life ’s about , taking a chance ? ’ in 2012 , 188 lung transplants were carried out			0
yet at any one time there are about 240 people waiting for such an operation			2
recent developments in techniques , sometimes dubbed ‘ washing ’ , mean that today just over a third of lung transplants come from patients who smoked			0
doctors believe that if rules were relaxed further , up to 100 more lungs a year would become available			1
these would be from groups designated ‘ sub-optimal ’ – not considered good enough to donate			0
campaigners also want the rules regarding age limits for donors erased , and for lungs from those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma , diabetes and even hepatitis to be considered viable			2
‘ common sense suggests that lungs from a donor who smoked ca n’t be very healthy , but studies have shown that three - year survival rates following a lung transplant are unaffected by whether or not the donor was a smoker , ’ says @entity95 , professor of respiratory transplant medicine at @entity97			1
‘ some risk continues to exist , such as development of lung cancer in the donor lung of a smoker			2
tiny cancers are not visible on inspection so there is a small chance that such a cancer could be transplanted with the donor lung			0
but this is a very rare occurrence			0
’ donation , donation : the average waiting list for new lungs is two years the average survival after a lung transplant is six years			1
‘ it is more important to get a transplant performed than worry about potential risks that may or may not happen 15 years later , ’ adds prof @entity95			2
in august 2012 , there was shock at the lung cancer death of @entity131 , a 27 - year - old @entity39 patient			1
sixteen months earlier she had undergone a lung transplant – she later found out that the donor had smoked 20 cigarettes a day throughout their life			2
her widower @entity137 , 29 , says : ‘ we got the devastating news of the cancer diagnosis in march 2012			0
almost as an afterthought , the consultant revealed that her lung donor had been a smoker			2
we were incredulous that this had n’t been mentioned before her transplant			0
’ despite what happened , @entity137 still believes other @entity39 patients should be given the choice of accepting a smoker ’s lungs			1
‘ i support the @entity23 in its quest for extended criteria to increase the number of donors			0
but we have to ensure the transplant process is transparent			0
someone else might have accepted a smoker ’s lungs for a chance of life , but @entity131 would n’t have risked it			1
’ although the number of patients requiring transplants increases every year , the criteria for deciding whether lungs are suitable for operations has changed little in 30 years			1
currently only 20 per cent of the donor lungs available in the @entity168 are used for transplant			0
‘ we do n’t try to persuade someone to take a smoker ’s lungs , but we offer them a balanced view of any risks and allow them to make the decision , ’ says prof @entity95			1
@entity131 was never allowed that choice and the hospital that treated her , @entity179 , has since apologised and revised its policy on informing patients about the risks of cancer			0
all donor lungs are carefully assessed according to standard guidance set by the @entity187 and @entity188 ( @entity189 )			0
surgeons look at how well oxygen is getting in to the blood , and carry out a chest x-ray to check for signs of infection			0
during a donor operation , they are able to carry out a visual assessment of the lungs and information about the donor ’s smoking history is always collected from the next of kin by a specialist nurse			0
@entity189 rules say that donors should have smoked no more than one packet of cigarettes a day for 20 years			1
anyone one who has smoked for more than 20 years falls into the category of a ‘ marginal ’ donor			0
a technique called @entity212 , which attaches the lungs to a ventilator that supplies oxygen and mimics breathing and pumps them with a nutrient fluid , allows doctors to further assess the performance of the lungs			1
‘ smoking is an easy thing to blame when things go wrong , ’ says prof @entity95			0
‘ no donor organ is brand new , but in every case we ’re confident that the donor lung can function and is good enough to save the life of that patient			0
’ for @entity31 , any set of donor lungs is better than none at all			1
‘ until you are on the waiting list you can not picture what it ’s like , ’ she says			0
‘ given a choice between not having a transplant or receiving the lungs of a smoker , i ’d take my chance for a better life rather than live like this			1

@entity39 sufferer @entity31 would rather take a smoker 's lungs
the 23 - year - old has been waiting for new lungs for two years
@entity31 spends two weeks a month in hospital receiving antibiotics
takes more than 60 medications a day , and sleeps with an oxygen mask
