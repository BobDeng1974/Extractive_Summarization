by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 18 september 2013 tablet computers and @entity2 have become something of a regular prop held by newsreaders and television presenters while they talk to camera			0
but @entity9 presenter @entity8 left viewers baffled when he introduced a feature about ' drunk tanks ' by holding something slightly less technical			1
the 51 - year - old broadcaster had intended to pick up his trusted @entity2 when the cameras prepared to roll in the @entity9 studios - but instead grabbed a pack of photocopier paper			1
but the @entity9 later said he had picked it up by mistake			1
although he realised his error , @entity8 did n't have time to swap his paper for the expensive gadget and instead ' went with it '			0
a spokeswoman for @entity9 explained : ' this morning as @entity8 was preparing to introduce this story , instead of picking up his tablet to hold as he went to air , he mistakenly picked up a ream of paper that was sitting next to it			1
' in the rush of live news , he did n’t have an opportunity to swap the items , so simply went with it			0
' in the past the presenter has been seen briefly resting his head on the desk when cameras cut to him			1
improvising : a @entity9 spokesman said that mr @entity8 did n't have time to swap the props around following his mistake and just ' went with it ' form : the presenter has previously been seen resting his head on the desk when cameras cut to him during a bulletin the camera had cut away for the local news to be read , but when it returned mr @entity8 was seen with his head resting on his folded arms on the desk			1
he suddenly sat bolt upright and looked sheepish as he tried to regain his composure beside co-presenter @entity69			0
following a number of mocking messages from @entity73 followers , @entity8 eventually tweeted : ' i was not asleep ! ' he added : ' it was a long desk head - banging that was n't meant to be picked up in the @entity76 opt ! ! ' but his co-presenter weighed in and jokingly told her own followers : ' intravenous caffeine now being administered to @ simonmccoy			1
’ previous : mr @entity8 appeared to be asleep when the camera cut away for him to read the local news during a bulletin last year mr @entity8 's gaffe is far from the first to befall @entity9 presenters			1
in 2007 , @entity9 consumer affairs correspondent @entity86 interviewed who she thought was it journalist @entity89 about the legal battle between the @entity92 ' @entity91 and @entity93 over the use of an apple symbol as the logo			2
but her guest was in fact taxi driver @entity98			0
mr @entity98 gamely attempted to answer the interviewer 's questions , but later described the incident as ' very stressful '			0
in 2009 , a segment on @entity104 about an expletive - filled rant from actor @entity106 on the set of the @entity109 film which was caught on camera left producers red - faced			2
mistaken identity : @entity9 presenter @entity86 interviews a cab driver thinking he is internet expert @entity89 ooops : @entity104 presenter @entity117 accidentally flashed a glimpse of her underwear in a live broadcast on monday morning viewers were left shocked however when an unedited version of the rant was broadcast			2
the curse of live broadcasting has n't just affected newsreaders in the past either , @entity9 weathermen have been known to fall foul of the odd gaffe			0
in 2010 , @entity9 viewers saw weatherman @entity131 brazenly sticking his middle finger up at breakfast show presenters @entity8 and @entity135 , who were off - camera			2
last year , @entity138 mistakenly swore in a live broadcast when instead of saying ' bucket loads of sunshine ' he predicted ' bucket loads of c * * * '			0
