downpours are expected to drench parts of @entity2 again today as autumn appears to have arrived early bringing gale force winds and temperatures as low as @entity5			1
summer is almost certainly over as chilly winds blowing in from @entity8 could send the mercury to as low as @entity5 in parts of @entity11 while the @entity12 and @entity13 could experience lows of @entity15			1
coasts in the north of @entity18 could also be battered by 50mph gale force winds while the rest of the country faces increasingly blustery conditions			1
but the weather front had shifted towards the continent early this morning and two flood warnings and nine flood alerts , mainly in the @entity59 , remained of the 34 issued yesterday morning			2
@entity60 , a spokesman for forecaster @entity61 , said : ' the front that brought those heavy downpours is moving to the continent and for today there will be some thundery showers , mainly from the @entity69 area to @entity70 but not as heavy as yesterday			1
' the @entity71 warned immediate action be taken in @entity73 and @entity74 , as high @entity76 spring tides meant high water levels and flooding was expected this morning			2
morning calm : a misty dawn breaks over farmland in @entity82 , @entity83 , ahead of forecast heavy rain last signs of summer : a walker stands in the late - summer heather on @entity88 , near @entity89 , in the @entity90 end of blue skies ? @entity92 on the @entity94 coastline today with a huge display of pink hydrangea in full bloom and while the rain may have eased off , warmer weather is still some way from making a return , as mr @entity60 warned : ' saturday looks like a fine day but sunday will be windy , with gusts of up to 50mph in some places			1
' as a result of yesterday ’s rainfall , which @entity107 ( @entity107 ) called ' biblical ' on @entity108 , the service said it had been called out to around 20 separate flooding - related incidents in a little over an hour			0
most of the incidents were understood to have involved water getting into the basements of properties			0
@entity107 said one person was rescued from a flooded basement flat in @entity118 , south @entity36 , after water ' entered via street drains due to heavy rain '			1
it comes after the tail - end of @entity123 caused the wettest 24 - hour period of the year last weekend			2
environment minister @entity125 said : ' heavy rain can often bring a risk of localised flooding			1
information is available from the @entity71 and emergency services and i urge people to listen to the advice and warnings issued			0
' music fans at @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 , would be wise not to forget their waterproofs and wellington boots , as scattered showers are expected to hit the site over the weekend			1
around 35,000 cars will be travelling to the site for the start of the event today , with chaos predicted on the surrounding roads			0
entrance : music fans arrived at @entity151 in @entity137 , @entity138 , ahead of this weekend 's @entity136 - without their wellington boots attire : three revellers arrive at the festival wearing shorts , but have their wellington boots on ready for the showers that are expected throughout the weekend warning : the @entity33 has said the festival , which is being held at the site in @entity138 as well as @entity160 in @entity90 , will be hit by rain and points over the next three days home for the weekend : two festival - goers carry bedding and a folding chair as they find a spot to set up camp for the event outlook : the forecast shows that showers are expected to continue , with rain covering most of the country on sunday alert : a yellow weather warning has been issued for a large part of central and eastern @entity18 with heavy rain forecast in the next 24 hours the @entity2 has already seen nearly its entire rainfall for august in the first half of the month			1
figures released by the @entity33 show that up to the 13th of august , there has been 86.1mm of rain , just short of the 89.5mm long - term ( 1981 - 2010 ) average			2
looking at individual countries , @entity11 has already seen more than its full - month average with 121.4mm of rain so far compared to the average of 116.7mm			1
the @entity191 and @entity192 areas have been particularly wet , with significant flooding from ex-hurricane @entity194 on 10 to 11 august			0
rainfall for @entity18 and @entity195 so far is just under the full - month average , while @entity197 has been the driest relatively speaking – with 83.2mm of rain making up 77 per cent of its full - month average			2
normally at this stage you would expect about 42 per cent of the average to have fallen			0
with regards to temperatures and sunshine , the month has been much closer to average so far			0
the @entity2 mean temperature is currently @entity208 , which is @entity209 above the full - month average			0
@entity2 sunshine hours are at 77.8 hours , which is 48 per cent of the full - month average – so just ahead of where we ’d expect after 13 days of the month			0
while these figures are interesting , they do n’t tell us where the month will end up overall – we ’ll have to wait until the full - month figures are in before deciding where this august fits in to the records			0
as we head in to next week there should be a good deal of drier weather but with northerly winds bringing in cooler air it will feel colder than of late , especially at night			1
this will feel noticeably cool in the wind , so people heading out in the evening may want to take a few extra layers			0
