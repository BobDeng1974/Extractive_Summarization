president @entity0 said tuesday in @entity1 that while racism - related fears of some african - americans are ' not made up ' and ' rooted in realities , ' there is ' no excuse ' for the violence that turned parts of @entity9 , @entity10 into an urban war zone on monday night			1
' a grand jury made a decision yesterday that upset a lot of people , ' he acknowledged , but framed the widespread arsons and looting as the result of ' frustrations ' which are ' not just about a particular incident			0
they have deep roots in many communities of color			0
' race - based resentments in @entity27 , said @entity0 , the first black @entity27 president , are ' not just made up			1
it 's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time			1
' but he complained about agitators and organizers who led groups in ' burning buildings , torching cars , destroying property , putting people at risk , ' instead of finding ' productive ways of responding ' to a grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer for shooting a black teen in self - defense			1
president @entity0 spoke on tuesday about civil unrest in @entity9 , @entity10 at the @entity48 in @entity1 @entity49 , do n't torch : stores burned to the ground on monday in actions that @entity0 condemned as worthy of criminal prosecutions immigration : the president was in @entity1 to promote his immigration overhaul , a policy that polls show is wildly unpopular ' that 's destructive and there 's no excuse for it , ' he said			1
' those are criminal acts , and people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts			1
' but returning to the theme of black communities fearing police forces that do n't match their racial make - up , he warned that ' if any part of the @entity27 community does n't feel welcomed or treated fairly , that 's something that puts all of us at risk and we all have to be concerned about [ it ]			1
' attorney general @entity79 , who announced last week that he would leave his post when a replacement is confirmed by the @entity82 , reiterated tuesday that his @entity83 is pursuing twin investigations into policeman @entity86 ' shooting of @entity87 , and into the @entity9 , @entity88 as a whole			0
but @entity0 said it was ' not my job as president to comment on ongoing investigations			1
' he did offer that @entity79 would soon host ' regional meetings focused on building trust in our communities , ' and added that there are ' very specific steps we can take to make sure law enforcement is fair			1
' turning back to the violence 300 miles to the south in suburban @entity105 , he warned protesters just an hour before nightfall that ' nothing of significance , nothing of benefit results from destructive acts			0
' ' i 've never seen a civil rights law or a health care bill or an immigration bill result because a car got burned			0
' ' do n't take the short term easy route and just engage in destructive behavior , ' @entity0 implored			2
' i have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities			2
' the president 's comments on the social unrest came at the beginning of a longer speech promoting and defending his decision last week to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants by giving them temporary get - out - of - deportation - free status until the end of his term in office			2
appearing in a predominantly @entity140 - @entity27 neighborhood and greeting the crowd with a greeting in @entity140 – ' @entity143 ! ' – he insisted that his action was justified by the positive contributions immigrants have made to @entity27 's social fabric			2
the self - declared immigrant who introduced him , however , came to the @entity27 legally			0
tuesday 's speech , scheduled long before the @entity9 debacle , was part of a @entity153 strategy to broaden the appeal of his amnesty strategy beyond the @entity158 community that will benefit most			0
three hecklers at the @entity48 , out of a crowd estimated at 1,800 , interrupted @entity0 , yelling that he had not done enough to stop the @entity161 from sending illegal immigrants back to their countries of origin			1
@entity164 at the ready : @entity167 troops readied for deployment on tuesday in front of @entity9 , @entity10 police headquarters @entity170 : this was a beauty salon and a wireless phone store before some in a mob riot torched it on monday night some in the crowd booed the activists and shouted for them to take their seats , according to a @entity153 press pool report			0
it ' does n’t make sense to yell at me right now , ' the president told them , emphasizing that he had just unveiled an aggressive policy move in their direction			0
' what you 're not paying attention to is , i just took an action to change the law			2
' the supportive audience applauded , but @entity193 will howl at @entity0 's candid admission that he had ' changed ' a federal law – precisely the point of view that the @entity153 has argued in recent days was inaccurate			2
' the way the change in the law works , ' he said next , ' is that we 're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration law generally			0
' after listening to the hecklers awhile longer , he said , ' there are other ways of engaging			0

president said black communities ' *distrust* of white law enforcement is ' rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time '
but he *calmly* condemned violent rioters and looters , saying ' people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts '
' i have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities , ' he said
@entity0 appeared at a @entity140 community center in @entity1 to promote his immigration order that will save millions of illegals from risk of deportation
he pushed back against hecklers who *wanted* broader action , pointing out that he ' just took an action to change the law '
