by @entity0 published : 18:51 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 7 october 2012 health secretary @entity1 , pictured with his family , has caused tension in the @entity5 party after saying he believes the abortion limit should be halved to 12 weeks health secretary @entity1 was embroiled in a major row last night after controversially backing a reduction in the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) described @entity1 ’s comments as ‘ insulting to women ’ and said such a policy would cause serious harm			1
the prime minister and the @entity16 were forced to distance themselves from mr @entity1 ’s views – aired just weeks after his appointment in the cabinet reshuffle – and insisted that there were no plans to change the current policy on abortion			1
however , @entity25 indicated that he supported a ‘ modest reduction ’ in the current limit and home secretary @entity26 also revealed her support for the limit to be reduced to 20 weeks			1
but last night mr @entity25 said he did not agree with mr @entity1			2
‘ he is a member of parliament , he is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view , a view of conscience and on this issue all members of @entity35 – prime ministers , @entity36 , everybody – has to vote according to their consciences , ’ he said			2
‘ but people need to know the government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote			0
’ mr @entity25 added : ‘ i personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because i think there are some medical arguments for that			1
’ mr @entity1 was forced to clarify his views yesterday after failing to acknowledge medical abortions , when women choose to end a pregnancy after discovering severe foetal abnormalities			2
various medical conditions are often picked up only at the 12 - week or 20 - week scans and mr @entity1 ’s failure to recognise this led to accusations that he was ‘ out of touch ’ with women ’s health issues			1
but a spokeswoman for the health secretary said : ‘ he is in favour of abortions for medical reasons			2
so the accusation that a 12 - week limit would curtail testing for conditions like @entity72 is simply not true			2
‘ he is talking about abortions for social reasons after 12 weeks			0
’ prime minister @entity25 , pictured two years ago with his wife @entity75 and their newborn baby daughter @entity78 , says there are no plans to change the law on abortion mr @entity1 made his comments in his first major interview since accepting the health brief in july			1
he originally voted in favour of halving the termination limit during a @entity89 vote in 2008 as a member of the @entity91			0
‘ everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is , and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start			0
i do n’t think the reason i have that view is for religious reasons			0
’ home secretary @entity26 has also revealed her support to modestly reduce the abortion limit from 24 to 20 weeks mr @entity1 ’s comments were widely condemned			1
@entity112 , shadow home secretary and minister for women & @entity115 , said : ‘ everyone has personal views but as health secretary , @entity1 has a responsibility to lead @entity41 policy on women ’s health			1
‘ perhaps the most chilling part of his interview is the claim that 12 weeks is based on evidence when it undoubtedly is not			0
@entity25 needs to make sure his health secretary does n’t distort medical evidence and does not impose his own view on women about their health			1
’ @entity132 , @entity134 ’s @entity133 , accused ministers of ‘ playing politics with people ’s lives ’ and insisted there was no justification for a reduction in the present limit			2
meanwhile , @entity5 mp dr @entity143 tweeted : ‘ profoundly disagree with @entity1 on lowering abortion limit ; would restrict access to safe abortion for most vulnerable who present late			1
’ @entity10 spokeswoman dr @entity148 said : ‘ the comments made by @entity1 politicise the debate around the abortion time limit and do not put women at the centre of their care			1
reducing the time limit to 12 weeks would severely limit women ’s choice at an extremely difficult time in their life			0
’ according to official figures , there were 189,931 abortions in 2011 , only a slight increase since 2010			0
more than 90 per cent took place before 13 weeks and just eight per cent were carried out between 12 weeks and 24 weeks			0
of those , 2,307 were carried out because of a risk the child would be born disabled			0
those who argue for a reduction in the limit say there is evidence that a child born at 20 weeks could survive in hospital .			0

@entity25 said @entity1 is entitled to his own opinion
but adds there are no plans to change the law regarding the abortion limit
