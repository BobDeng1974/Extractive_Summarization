@entity1 clubs are now so wealthy through their tv deals that they can afford to turn down a title sponsorship worth £ 45million a year			1
@entity4 offered the top flight a huge deal of £ 135m over three years , a £ 5m - a - year increase on the payments from @entity9 , whose 15 - year partnership with the @entity1 will finish at the end of next season			1
but the clubs awash with over £ 5billion from domestic tv rights alone rejected the bid from @entity4 ’s parent company @entity17 , in part because some teams have conflicting beer deals			1
the @entity1 has turned down a bid from @entity4 to replace @entity9 as the title sponsor instead the @entity1 want as much as £ 60m a year from a mega title backer but will also examine a multi-partnership sponsorship model			1
such are the tv riches that the smaller clubs in the @entity1 are the ones more anxious about the sponsorship money — the £ 3m - a - year split does n’t make much difference to the top of the table			1
the @entity32 , meanwhile , have failed to find an ‘ in association ’ @entity34 partner this season prepared to pay £ 9m a year , although it ’s understood @entity37 finally have someone at the table after well over a year ’s search			1
the league 's mega-rich clubs have demanded a deal in the region of £ 60m - a - season from 2016 @entity46 ’ petty refusal to let pundit @entity49 present @entity47 with the champion jump jockey trophy at his @entity52 farewell on saturday — because it ’s on @entity53 — does n’t mean that an @entity55 legend will not doing the honours			1
another iconic @entity58 name has been lined up for the role although @entity52 officials want to keep his identity a secret from @entity64 until the ceremony			0
it ’s known that @entity67 is unavailable while the ‘ legendary ’ tag surely rules out @entity69 , the @entity70			0
@entity71 , record goalscorer before @entity49 , would be a good choice			2
@entity49 's ( centre ) contract with @entity46 have presented him presenting a trophy to @entity47 @entity78 boss @entity77 ’s elevation to chairman of the @entity81 cricket commercial committee will aid the sport ’s chronic need for more terrestrial tv coverage			1
@entity77 will push for a free - to - air highlights deal for the domestic @entity86 this summer which would be vital to grow a tournament that is in the shadow of the @entity89 and the @entity90			1
@entity91 is not known as a bon viveur			0
but the @entity46 pundit was keen enough to meet up with the class of 92 for a birthday party in honour of @entity98 ’s wife @entity97 at a @entity100 casino that he left @entity101 last sunday on the back of a dispatch rider ’s motorbike			2
@entity91 was desperate to get away from @entity101 to get to @entity98 's wife 's birthday party second chance saloon the @entity109 awards — the best football dinner in the calendar by a distance — showed this year there is a way back for some football offenders			2
shortlisted for the player in the community honour was @entity119 ’s @entity118 , who served 16 months in prison for intimidating a witness in a murder trial			0
and one of the contenders for goal of the season was @entity128 ’s @entity127 , who was banned for five months for betting on his own team when he played for @entity130			0
@entity132 ’ banned owner @entity131 has few fans — understandably , considering the constant turmoil at @entity135			0
yet it was the @entity137 who insisted midfielder @entity139 , voted @entity141 apprentice of the year , was given a first - team chance			2
@entity131 may not be popular but his decision to force @entity139 into the first team paid off meanwhile , @entity132 put out a statement after the sick - note six ruled themselves out of the match at @entity148 , saying that the club ‘ stand by internal medical recommendations ’			2
yet when the @entity132 medical staff advised @entity131 about the chronic knee condition of @entity154 player @entity153 , he was still signed on loan and played 13 minutes of league football before needing more surgery			0
@entity158 will stay silent @entity159 , who walked out of her job as ceo of @entity162 2015 before she was pushed , cut a relaxed figure at the @entity109 awards dinner			0
@entity159 left her post six months ahead of the @entity166 following a breakdown in relationship with the interfering @entity169			0
the chances of @entity159 , an independent director of the @entity171 , ever going public with the personal reasons for her exit are remote .			0

*drinks* company offered @entity1 £ 45million - a - year deal
but clubs turned it down because they have other deals with beers
