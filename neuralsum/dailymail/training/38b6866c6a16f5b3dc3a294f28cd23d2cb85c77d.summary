' when i look back at my university years i was tanned pretty much all the time			0
the results of the scan were a shocker			2
i was the oldest girl there and the @entity14 damage was much worse than the others			2
' it really made me think			0
i have not had any sunbeds since - not for @entity67 parties and not for @entity68			2
i have been looking online for a bronzer			0
' skin expert dr @entity70 , who reviewed the x-rays , said : ' @entity10 has easily the greatest degree of damage			1
clusters of speckled areas are seen right across the face			2
her top lip has escaped but the cheeks , bridge of nose , sides of face and forehead have not			2
it 's hoped the campaign will highlight the dangers of sunbeds to youngsters often wanting to emulate the tans of @entity26 stars , such as @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 and @entity93 this month @entity94 is raising awareness of the danger of sunbed use with a campaign entitled ' @entity99 ' , backed by leading skin specialists sk : n clinics			1
fine and coarse wrinkles are seen on sun damaged skin			0
it may also become patchy , or mottled darker patches of increased pigmentation may appear			0
sometimes these patches become irregular and produce what are known as lentigos			0
in areas around the back of the neck , a leathery texture and coarseness with deep lines is frequently seen , the skin may feel dry and scaly			0
chronic sun exposure will also produce a thickened layer in the upper dermis known as solar elastosis , which gives a yellowish chicken skin look			0

figures show using a sunbed just once or more a month could increase the chance of developing skin cancer by 50 per cent			1
malignant melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer , is the second most common cancer amongst 15 to 34 year olds			1
the campaign will see experts touring shopping centres with the machines , which offer in depth images of faces , to let people see first - hand how damaged their skin might be			1
it calls on people across the nation to face the damage , often invisible to the naked eye , being inflicted on their skin in pursuit of a tan , by offering free skin assessments at sk : n clinics across @entity156			2
the skin scan highlights such things as pigmentation and premature wrinkles , caused by overexposure to uv rays from sunbeds , a turn off for all young women worried about their appearance			1
@entity94 's senior health campaigns manager @entity166 said : ' we are glad to be bringing @entity99 back to @entity156 this february			0
the initiative aims to stave off the temptation to hit the sunbeds this winter by exposing the often unnoticed , long - term skin damage sunbeds can cause ' we have seen many young people know about the risks of sunbed use , but still believe they make them look and feel better			1
' working with sk : n , this initiative will allow people to see the cosmetic damage from sunbed use , showing every time someone uses a sunbed they are damaging their skin , making it look worse in the long run and making skin coarse , leathery and wrinkled			1
' no one wants to look older before their time , so we hope the skin scan will really help to change people 's minds about using sunbeds			2
spokesman @entity194 said : ' you may look perfectly fine on the surface but what the scanner does is show up what is going on underneath			0
' our model in the picture is just a member of the public who had been using sunbeds not even that much			0
obviously , she was horrified , and is not using them any more			0
as well as the public being able to visit sk : n clinics , @entity94 will be taking @entity99 on tour this month at major shopping centres in @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity26 .			0
