@entity0 took home the crown of @entity3 in march this year a beauty queen who suffered years of torment for being too good looking has had the last laugh by taking home a national title			1
@entity0 , 18 , saw her first victory at the young age of 14 when she won her first prize at a local competition			1
but rather than receiving congratulations from her peers @entity16 , from @entity17 , @entity13 was subjected to vicious name - calling and trolling on social media sites from other jealous pupils			1
the college student became so down - trodden by the constant abuse that she came close to giving up on competing completely			0
@entity16 says that the bullying started early and as she was met with more success the abuse only worsened			1
she explains : ' i was only 14 - years - old when i did my first event and i won			2
but when i started doing more and more modelling and events the bullying got worse			0
' it started off with sly name calling in school but over time it turned much worse - things were being posted about me on social media			2
' @entity16 says her bullies tried to justify their behaviour by claiming that she thought herself superior to everyone			1
' people would say that i thought i was better than them just because i was competing as a beauty queen			0
' even people that were my best friends would call me names and things like that			0
the bigger the event i did , the worse the bullying got			0
' i was called a sl * * a b * * * * and all sorts of other things - it was the most upsetting things you could imagine			0
' @entity16 says that the torment became endless with her abusers able to attack her both at home and in school			1
' there 's nothing worse than seeing people saying such horrible things about you online and then giving you abuse the next day in school - it was horrific			2
' i considered giving it up because it was leaving me in tears - people who i thought were my friends turned their backs on me all because i was doing something i loved			0
' but i did more and more events and started growing in confidence - i realised that i should n't let bullies have their own way			2
' the determined student this year was able to overcome her demons and hit - back at her bullies after she was crowned @entity3 in march			1
@entity16 had almost given up on her pageanting dream after she faced years of torment for being too good looking @entity16 , who studies hair and media make - up at @entity17 college , was first scouted while shopping in @entity94 and romped to victory in her maiden event , miss @entity98 2010			1
she started commercial modelling a year later and has travelled to the @entity100 to do a range of photo - shoots on several occasions			0
although @entity16 had enjoyed much success up to this point her win at @entity3 @entity3 meant the most to the 18 - year - old as it not only helped her get over years of torment but also saw the launch of international opportunities			1
the win earned her a place at the @entity114 event in @entity115 in the summer where she competed over four days for the prestigious title			2
she missed out on the top - spot but said she has been offered the chance to return to the @entity100 for more modelling shoots in the future			0
@entity16 says that she would face her bullies in school and then come home only for the abuse to continue online via social networking sites @entity16 's dreams came true when she took home first prize at the @entity3 @entity3 awards ( pictured ) earning her a place in the @entity114 event in @entity115 in the summer @entity16 says that although she did n't win the crown she really enjoyed competing and gained a lot of experience			1
' the standard was incredibly high over there and unfortunately i did n't win but it was a phenomenal experience			2
' we did photo shoots and all sorts of things - i 've even been offered to go back and do some more modelling which is something i 'm seriously considering			0
' i 'm in my final year at college and i 'm still deciding whether or not to go to university so we 'll see what happens			0
' @entity16 , who is now an ambassador for charity @entity147 , is determined to share her experiences with other victims of online bullying			1
although @entity16 did not take home the crown at the @entity115 awards , she says she was thrilled to have taken part @entity16 is now an ambassador for charity , @entity155 , is determined to share her experiences with other victims of online bullying ' it 's great to be able to have all of these things on my cv after everything that happened - all i want to do now is help other people			1
' as an ambassador for the bullies out charity , i travel to schools in @entity17 and give talks to people about bullying			1
' it 's great to share my experiences and hopefully help others who are suffering the same thing			0
' @entity16 hopes that her story can prove that it is possible to do what you love no matter what others think			2
' i want to show people that you do n't have to put up with bullies - you should always stick to your guns and do what you want to do			0
' it 's very hard at times but you 'll always have the last laugh			0
