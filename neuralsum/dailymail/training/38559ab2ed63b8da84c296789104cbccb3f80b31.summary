you ca n't see the men but you can see all those passengers watching , it sent a shiver down my spine when i saw that			2
some of them were actually jumping up to get a better view			2
it was like they thought we were actors on @entity199 or something			0
' since the assault i have had a lot of support on @entity205 and @entity206 , that has restored my faith a little bit - they are calling my dad a hero which he is			2
