passenger aircraft will fly in formation like birds in the latter half of this century , according to a radical new vision of the future of flight by one of the world 's leading aircraft manufacturers			2
@entity11 firm @entity10 says formation flying could become a reality on high - frequency routes under their vision for flying from 2050 and beyond			1
the company also envisages planes climbing more steeply from take - off and gliding in to land to reduce noise and emissions			1
the company believes this could become reality in the second half of the century @entity10 added that by the middle of the 21st century flights in @entity11 and the @entity32 could on average be around 13 minutes shorter , saving around nine million tonnes of fuel a year			1
and highly - intelligent aircraft would be able to ' self - organise ' selecting the most efficient and environmentally - friendly routes			0
the shorter flights would lead to the saving of more than 28 million tonnes of avoidable @entity40 emissions a year as well as the saving of five million flying hours			2
a computer simulated image of an aircraft take - off in continuous ' eco-climb ' @entity10 engineering executive vice president @entity46 said : ' our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with ‘ disruptive ’ ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to			0
' these and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates			0
' that is why our latest future by @entity61 concepts focus on not just what we fly , but how we may fly in 2050 and beyond			0
' airport of the future : low emissions ground operations in 2050 according to @entity10 @entity10 believes that by the middle of the 21st century flights in @entity11 and the @entity32 could on average be around 13 minutes shorter , saving around nine million tonnes of fuel a year			1

manufacturer @entity10 has *released* a ' vision for flying from the middle of century and beyond '
they believe flights in @entity11 and the @entity32 could on average be around 13 minutes shorter
@entity80 , steeper take - offs and gliding into land will reduce emissions and noise
