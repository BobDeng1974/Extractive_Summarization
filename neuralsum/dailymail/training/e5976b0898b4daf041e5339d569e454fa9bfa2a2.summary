by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 9 april 2012 updated : 02:36 est , 10 april 2012 the happy announcement at the weekend that the @entity2 had been awarded the greatest personal honour in the @entity5 ’s gift — @entity6 — seemed to set the seal on a troubled past and to pave the way for a bright new future			1
indeed , there will be many across the country who ’ve had a chance to meet @entity15 in the seven years since she became a fully paid - up member of the @entity17 , who will see the honour as fitting and just			1
though fearless in the saddle , she was timid and nervy when enduring her first public engagements			0
honoured : the @entity5 has awarded the @entity2 the greatest personal honour in her gift , @entity25 of the @entity6 many will think it is a tribute to her application to the job — and her determination to overcome those fears — that she has earned such an outstanding honour in this , the @entity5 ’s finest year			1
her supporters will say that since 2005 @entity15 has n’t put a foot wrong			1
and if she has n’t set the world on fire , that is by design			2
in the run - up to the perfunctory civil ceremony that sealed her long - time love affair with prince @entity44 , a strategy was devised that would position her in the nation ’s perceptions as a substitute for the recently deceased queen mother — rather than the woman whose place she took in the princely bed , princess @entity52			1
happy couple : her supporters say that since her marriage to prince @entity44 in 2005 @entity15 ' has n't put a foot wrong ' so there were lots of fussy hats , regal waves and a certain formal distance placed between @entity15 and the public — whose love and trust she had to gain			1
@entity68 was placed on age and dignity			0
the past ? airbrushed away			0
as a strategy it had its critics but it ’s fair to say the passage of seven years has helped reduce hostility			0
people have slowly forgotten that gloomy day at @entity78 when the couple married , and the way in which police forcibly removed soft - voiced protesters legitimately expressing their fears about the suitability of mrs @entity86 as a future queen consort			0
no one knows better than @entity90 courtiers how the @entity92 public forgive and forget when it comes to the @entity94			0
and , to an extent , the nation has forgiven and forgotten : the dark times have been buried in the past			0
big shoes to fill : following in the footsteps of the iconic princess @entity52 by becoming prince @entity44 ' second wife was always going to be difficult and so it might be supposed that last weekend was the right moment for the @entity5 to recognise and thank her daughter - in - law , and to welcome her into the most intimate fold of royalty — the order of chivalry that is in her gift , and her gift alone			1
yet is that what actually happened ? talking to historians and royal observers yesterday , a rather different picture emerged of the reasons for @entity15 ’s shiny new honour — and there is good reason for believing that prince @entity44 was heavily involved , lobbying on his wife ’s behalf			1
long ago the @entity5 expressed an adverse view of @entity15 , which probably has n’t fundamentally altered , i was told			1
‘ those who know the queen also know that once she has expressed a view , she very rarely retreats from it			0
that has been the hallmark of her reign — her consistency and clear - sightedness			0
‘ but the @entity5 is also a pragmatist			1
in her jubilee year , she would not wish it to be felt there was disaffection among the ranks of her family			0
’ this is why she has finally listened to urgent pleas by @entity44 that his wife should be given parity with lesser royals such as the @entity144 and prince @entity145 — high - ups in the @entity6			1
‘ this is personal for him — deeply personal , ’ i was told			0
‘ he sees that his own position is diminished if his wife continues not to be part of the inner - inner circle			2
it ’s also another part of his plan towards making @entity15 his queen			1
’ supporter : it is believed that prince @entity44 was key in ensuring his wife received the @entity6 the back - story here is the resentment caused by the elevation of mrs @entity86 to the status of royal wife seven years ago			1
two senior royal women , @entity163 and the @entity5 ’s cousin @entity164 , suddenly found themselves pushed down the pecking order at @entity166 , and effectively made to curtsey to a woman who just weeks before had been a commoner — and a much reviled one at that			1
‘ they would not put up with it , ’ i was told			2
‘ @entity5 was made aware of their discomfort and was forced to do something about it			1
’ as a result , a document entitled @entity176 to be observed at @entity166 was produced , and its purpose was to clarify @entity15 ’s place in the hierarchy			1
perversely , its effect was to downgrade her from the position she might have been expected to hold			0
as the wife of prince @entity44 , she should have taken precedence after the @entity5 , as princess @entity52 did			1
but instead , she found she ’d been moved down a peg or two			0
‘ @entity163 and princess @entity164 , who have given their adult lives to royal service , saw no reason to make obeisance to this , at the time , highly unpopular woman , ’ a former courtier explained			0
princess @entity163 , in particular , was extremely chilly towards @entity15 and made it clear she had no intention ever of curtseying to her			1
in fact , nothing had changed — @entity163 also refused to curtsey to @entity52 — but the @entity5 obviously felt uncomfortable with the situation , and so she had the @entity199 rewritten			1
happy family : @entity201 official handout of @entity44 and the @entity2 with their families all this was not lost on the @entity44 , who is as determined as ever to have @entity15 as his queen			1
he had been snubbed on that occasion			0
but once the @entity5 had spoken , nothing more could be done at the time			1
now , however , things appear to have changed			0
‘ it looks as if @entity44 finally got his way , ’ i was told yesterday			1
‘ he ’s managed to persuade the @entity5 , one way or the other , that @entity15 must be recognised			1
’ this , however , puts a slightly different gloss on @entity15 ’s brand - new damehood , which one commentator yesterday gushingly described as ‘ illustrating the @entity5 ’s fondness for her daughter - in - law			1
a public endorsement for her role within the family ’			0
what can be said to @entity15 ’s credit is that in more recent times she has committed herself to official duties and gathering as much acclaim as she can			1
and if an appearance in @entity228 , a visit to the set of the cult @entity232 detective series @entity234 , hamming it up for the cameras with an ice - cream or posing with look - alike @entity238 in @entity239 gets her the coverage , she ’ll do it			0
you ca n't say she is n’t trying ( though her progress into the nation ’s affections has been hampered by an incapacity to stand the strain of foreign tours			2
the word ‘ lazy ’ has been used in the past , though less of late )			0
but some critics argue that for the big events in national life — a calamity or a remembrance — she can never be seen as an appropriate representative of the people			0
while praise for her integration into the royal machine grows , and her support for the future king gathers appreciation , there ’s still a root - and - branch resistance to the idea of her becoming @entity5 , standing shoulder - to - shoulder with her husband on state occasions			2
this fundamental fact is acknowledged by courtiers , but not by @entity44			2
and so his campaign for equal status for his wife among the royal womenfolk goes doggedly on			2
royal command : @entity15 has been embraced by the @entity5 and the rest of the royal family some may ask what the fuss is about			1
after all , the @entity6 , once spoken of in hallowed tones , has lost its lustre recently			0
in the midst of the seedy scandal that enveloped the @entity284 last year — after it turned out his friend , the @entity281 financier @entity280 , was a paedophile and convicted sex offender — the @entity5 defiantly created her favourite son a @entity25 of the order			2
‘ the timing could not have been more deliberate , ’ i was told			0
‘ @entity290 was under fire on all sides			0
this friendship had been exposed , questions about what he was using his roving trade ambassador role for were being asked and his resignation was just around the corner			0
he was seen as shabby , arrogant and out of touch			0
‘ but at such times , the @entity94 circle the wagons and protect their own			0
so at the very height of the controversy , the @entity5 very publicly gave her son this shiny new gong			2
’ her majesty ’s sure - footed approach — consistent over a 60 - year reign — was , just this once , called into question			0
‘ the funny thing is that in this triumphant @entity313 year , people feel more and more protective of the @entity5 , ’ a senior historian explained yesterday			2
‘ no one wants anything to go wrong for her			2
no doubt she was persuaded that by bringing @entity15 into the shelter of her personal order of chivalry it would be seen as a conciliatory act			2
’ certainly it helps heal any rift there may be with her son over @entity15			2
and maybe that ’s the best way of looking at it — a gong for trying hard			0
but not the ultimate seal of approval from the @entity5			2
