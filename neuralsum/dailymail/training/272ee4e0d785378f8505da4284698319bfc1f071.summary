president @entity0 is expected to outline a seismic shift during tuesday 's annual @entity2 in how much tax @entity4 businesses pay , but the devil is in the details			1
while his plan will lower the top corporate rate , smaller companies whose proceeds are considered individual income – since they 're not organized as large corporations – wo n't see any benefit			2
and the net impact , says one @entity17 watchdog group , will be more money , not less , flowing into the federal government 's coffers			0
those funds , the group says , will be redistributed into public works projects calculated to benefit labor unions that support @entity0 and other @entity25			0
@entity0 hinted at a corporate tax overhaul proposal in his 2013 @entity2 speech , never bringing anything forward until 2014 when a congressional election looms large corporate giants like @entity31 would pay more taxes under @entity0 's plan when it kills deductions and closes loopholes , but the big companies would get a rate reduction in exchange -- unlike smaller businesses manufacturers love infrastructure projects near their factories , a fact @entity0 is hoping to leverage in order to get the @entity45 to go along with his plan : some of the new tax revenue would reportedly pay union - backed construction projects across @entity4 problem for @entity0 : the @entity4 has no rivals in the corporate - tax department among developed nations , according to data collected by the @entity55 ' the president ’s plan is a net tax increase , ' the right - leaning anti-tax group @entity56 said monday			1
' the plan raises taxes on all @entity4 employers , but only gives partial rate relief to the largest multi-national companies			0
' @entity0 will reportedly dust off a proposal tuesday night from his 2012 campaign , when he argued for lowering the top corporate tax rate from 39.1 per cent to 28 per cent in exchange for closing a series of tax loopholes and disallowing a wide range of business tax deductions			1
those give - backs @entity0 would affect all businesses , both small and large , while only the largest corporations would see a reduction in their overall rates			1
the average top corporate tax rate among member nations in the @entity80 is 25 per cent , according to the nonprofit @entity55			2
@entity4 's top rate is the highest			0
and ' cutting the corporate rate to 28 percent will only help very large companies , ' @entity56 says , since most companies in @entity4 file and pay taxes using the individual tax rates			1
' @entity89 data show that 32 million businesses file tax returns every year , and fewer than 2 million of them are corporations that can tax advantage of tax rates and loopholes extended to @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and other @entity101 titans			0
the @entity102 reported saturday that a source who received a private @entity105 briefing advised the paper to ' expect to hear mr. @entity0 trumpet a proposal he made last year : reworking the business - tax system and directing proceeds to roads , bridges and other public works projects			2
' @entity56 sees those initiatives as @entity115 - aligned union construction projects			0
@entity116 , the group 's president , was aghast			0
oh , poop : dog - walkers and other small businessmen and women will continue to pay individual income tax rates on everything they earn , but they 'll have to give up the same deductions the big boys are slated to lose run your own consultancy from your kitchen table ? you 're out of luck , too -- stuck with a 44 per cent effective tax rate playing coy : a milquetoasty @entity105 press secretary @entity131 will say only that @entity0 will address ' the need to grow our economy in a way that rewards hard work and responsibility , that makes the middle class more secure ' that kiss @entity0 blew to his wife before delivering last year 's @entity2 address might be redirected this year to congressional @entity25 who need political cover to push his ' income inequality ' philosophy on the campaign trail ' again ? ' he asked when @entity147 contacted him in @entity17			1
' @entity0 is spraying perfume on and recycling two ideas that have already failed			0
' ' one , " tax reform " – by which he means higher overall taxes on businesses targeting entrepreneurs and the self - employed – and two , taking all that tax revenue and having another stimulus spending spree			2
' ' it failed the last time , ' said an exasperated @entity116			0
' how stupid does he think we are ? ' in his 2013 address , @entity0 promised several initiatives that never managed to arrive later in the year amid scandals that included @entity163 's sputtering start , an alleged @entity165 cover - up , the @entity167 's data collection programs , the @entity89 's targeting of tea party groups and the @entity171 's spying on journalists			1
harping a year ago on the so - called ' @entity174 rule , ' @entity0 told @entity175 that @entity4 deserved a ' tax code that ensures billionaires with high - powered accountants ca n’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries ... and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the @entity4			1
' a year later , the @entity105 is gearing up to take some action			0
but @entity56 warned monday that the net result would be a higher tax bill overall			2
' the @entity45 @entity105 would never support a net tax increase , and using the money to fund @entity193 ( and , by extension , @entity115 campaign coffers ) is hardly a sweetener , ' the group said in a statement			2
@entity0 is emboldened by the populist appeal of his ' income inequality ' argument , a @entity25 insider told @entity147			1
and he hopes to soften republicans for a minimum - wage hike by offering big business a carrot instead of a stick			0
' the president is now preparing speeches on income inequality , ' said @entity211 chair @entity210 , but ' i believe he should give those speeches while standing in front of the mirror , because under his watch , everything has gotten worse ' but the result may be a triple - whammy on employers if they find themselves squeezed simultaneously by a higher tax bill , higher wage costs and higher health care expenses			1
still , congressional democrats desperately need a defining issue to run on in the november midterm elections , and the @entity105 believes a rich - vs - poor argument can win the day with its base			1
and anything that sniffs of a tax cut for the rich , suggests @entity25 rep. @entity233 , wo n't play well with liberal voters			2
@entity235 chairs the @entity25 's congressional campaign organization			0
' middle - class security is the defining issue of our time , ' @entity235 told the @entity241			2
' our candidates are going to talk about what priority makes more sense for the middle class : increasing the minimum wage , or decreasing taxes for the wealthiest ? those contrasts are imperative and revealing			0
' the danger for @entity25 is that the current state of play for lower - income @entity4 has followed five years of @entity0 's presidency			1
@entity211 chairman @entity210 told a partisan crowd last week that @entity0 was trying to fix a problem that he caused himself			0
' the president is now preparing speeches on income inequality			2
i believe he should give those speeches while standing in front of the mirror , because under his watch , everything has gotten worse , ' @entity210 told the @entity45 's winter meeting in @entity17 ' his economic policies are not working , ' @entity265 @entity45 sen. @entity45 added sunday on the @entity268 program ' @entity269			0
' @entity56 president @entity116 , an anti-tax crusader whose pedigree dates from the @entity271 years , asked @entity0 supporters : ' how stupid does he think we are ? ' yes , you too : most @entity4 farmers are sole proprietors of their businesses , making them ineligible for what may appear to be a massive @entity0 tax rate cut while many small @entity4 businesses cope without any tax relief , @entity280 founder @entity279 will find his company 's earnings taxed at a lower rate under @entity0 's expected proposal after - tax @entity4 corporate profits are at a level not seen since the years following @entity289 and it has been 60 years since ordinary workers saw a smaller share of the nation 's economic output than they did in 2013			1
the campaign manager for a @entity45 @entity105 candidate in @entity296 , @entity235 's home state , told @entity147 on background that @entity0 's foray into tax policy could blow up in his face			1
' the president needs more democrats in @entity175 , and he 's not going to get there by offering what looks like a tax cut for @entity101 , ' the political operative said , ' even if the result is shareholders getting smaller dividends and @entity310 losing some of their bonuses			1
' ' it 's the perception that counts in november , and it sounds like @entity0 is going to have to go back to his people and whisper , " do n't worry about that corporate tax cut – i do n't really mean it			1
" ' the @entity105 has been mum on the content of @entity0 's speech			0
@entity131 , his press secretary , told reporters on friday only that the president would address ' the need to grow our economy in a way that rewards hard work and responsibility , that makes the middle class more secure			0

watchdog warns : @entity0 will head - fake by offering tax cuts to big businesses while closing loopholes on every company in @entity4
the result , says @entity56 , will be a bigger income for the government and no relief for small businesses
president @entity0 will deliver his annual @entity2 on tuesday night , and is expected to push ' income inequality ' policies
congressional democrats need a defining issue while @entity163 recovers
*explaining* away an apparent big - business tax cut will be hard for them , even if it 's not a real tax cut at all '
@entity45 campaign operative speculates : ' @entity0 is going to have to go back to his people and whisper , " do n't worry about that corporate tax cut – i do n't really mean it " '
