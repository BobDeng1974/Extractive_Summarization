new arrival : @entity0 is celebrating the birth of @entity2 , its first ever armadillo pup ( pictured )			0
the three - banded armadillo , a native to @entity5 , was born to mum @entity6 and dad @entity8 in august weighing just 0.1lb ( 81g ) @entity20 , senior presentations keeper at @entity0 , said the birth was an ' amazing achievement ' as @entity6 and @entity8 only arrived from @entity23 , in @entity24 , in march			1
' this is the first birth of any armadillo species at @entity0 , and it is amazing how quickly little @entity2 is growing up , ' he said			2
the @entity5 three - banded armadillo has a blackish - brown armour plating , which covers its body , head and tail			1
the plating comes in the form of two domed shells which are separated by three armoured bands of flexible of skin , allowing the armadillo to roll up into a ball			0

here @entity2 is pictured with her mum , @entity6			1
' you would never know that @entity6 was a first time mother as she is incredibly protective of @entity2 , ' said @entity20 , senior presentations keeper at @entity0 the @entity5 three - banded armadillo has a blackish - brown armour plating , which covers their body , head and tail			1

it has a great sense of smell , and uses it to find termites under the soil			0
the armadillo will thrust its nose into the soil and then use its tongue to reach its prey			0
the species reaches at most 20 inches ( 50cm ) in length and about 3.3lbs ( 1.5kg )			0
this has allowed it to survive 140 million years of evolution , but the creature is now listed as ' vulnerable ' because it lost nearly 50 per cent of its habitat in the last 15 years			2
the species produces one single offspring each year , so populations are slow to recover when hit by loss of habitat			0

the @entity85 dry forest , where most of these armadillos live , once covered about 11 per cent of the @entity5 territory , and that has now been reduced to around six per cent			1

' [ @entity2 ] is just amazing to watch , always full of energy and scurrying about her surroundings like a perfectly formed miniature of a fully grown three banded armadillo , ' said mr @entity20			2
' for her first few weeks she could not quite roll up into a perfect ball because of her huge claws and softer , smaller shell , but she has now grown into her shell and can quickly pack herself into the tightly sealed ball which adult three - banded armadillos are known for			1
' you would never know that @entity6 was a first time mother as she is incredibly protective of @entity2 , constantly watching or carrying her , but mum is also very relaxed and has had no problem getting her new - born to suckle from her			1
a star is born : @entity2 becomes the zoo 's fourth three - banded armadillo , along with parents and ten - year - old @entity112			1
mr @entity20 said the keepers discovered @entity6 was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back , and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut - sized baby endangered : the @entity5 three - banded armadillo has a blackish - brown armour plating , which covers their body , head and tail			1

mr @entity20 said the keepers discovered @entity6 was pregnant after discovering scratch marks on her back , and an ultrasound scan showed up a peanut - sized baby			0
' when she first arrived at @entity0 it did not take long for mum @entity6 to come out of her shell , very quickly becoming one of the stars of the @entity157 hilltop shows , scurrying about through the feet of the audience , ' he said			2
' however , after a few months , we noticed a slight change in her body weight and a few scratch marks on her back			0
putting two and two together we investigated with an ultrasound and were able to make out a peanut sized little armadillo shape			0
' the family all lived together just after the birth , however in the wild all armadillo species are solitary animals			0
' we recently had to take dad @entity8 away as female armadillos are ready to mate again about two weeks after the birth and another offspring would have been a bit too much for @entity6 at this stage			1
' back home : the @entity85 dry forest , where most of these armadillos live , once covered about 11 per cent of the @entity5 territory , and that has now been reduced to around six per cent			1

@entity2 was born to mum @entity6 and dad @entity8 in @entity186 in august
she weighs around 1lb ( 450g ) and is now the size of a grapefruit
