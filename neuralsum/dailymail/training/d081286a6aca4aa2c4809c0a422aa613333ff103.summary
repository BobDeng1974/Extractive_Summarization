by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:45 est , 25 february 2014 dozens more retired @entity4 police officers and firefighters have been arrested in connection to the disability benefits fraud scheme			1
another 28 people are going to be arrested throughout the day , making this the second round of arrests in the wide - ranging social security benefits scheme			1
the plot was first reported in january when the @entity14 announced that more than 100 people were arrested after being involved in a longterm plot wherein they claimed to have disabilities like post traumatic stress disorder in an effort to steal hundreds of thousands from the government			1
being taken in : this is one of the 28 former police and firefighters who were arrested today for their alleged involvement in the benefit fraud scheme that stole up to $ 400million from taxpayers tarnishing the badge : the latest batch of suspects have not yet been named but are being rounded up currently not all of the latest 28 offenders have been named , but one has been identified as former police officer @entity35 , whose father @entity36 was arrested last month after being labeled one of the scheme 's ' ringleaders '			1
of the latest arrests , 16 were retired @entity42 officers , four were from the fire department , one was from both the fire department and then police department and another was from the department of corrections			1
aside from those 21 individuals , there were seven others who were arrested today and the list of all 28 names was released publicly but it does not indicate which suspect corresponded with which agency			1
' last month â€™s indictment was the first step in ending a massive fraud against @entity59 taxpayers , ' said district attorney @entity60 in a statement			0
' today , dozens of additional defendants have been charged with fabricating psychiatric conditions in order to fraudulently obtain social security disability insurance , a critically important social safety net reserved for those truly in need			1
' these defendants are accused of gaming the system by lying about their lifestyle , including their ability to work , drive , handle money , shop , and socialize , in order to obtain benefits to which they were not entitled			0
under cover : some of the schemers had been benefiting from ill - earned disability payments for decades waiting for the story : the @entity82 has not yet released the names of the suspects but in their earlier round up of more than 100 recipients , they even told how they were determined to be falsifying their claims ' their lies were repetitive and extensive			1
my office is continuing to work with the @entity59 @entity91 to bring additional cases , where appropriate			0
' all told , prosecutors told the @entity94 that up to $ 400million may have been netted by the schemers , and it is entirely possible that hundreds of others could be arrested			1
there were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme on january 7			2
the recipients were a mix of 72 former @entity42 officers , eight former fire fighters , and other corrections officers all who made up different physical and psychological conditions that they reportedly incurred on the job			1
some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s - with the help of four administrative ringleaders - while others only started after the september 11 terrorist attacks			2
many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of @entity117 , and others said that their work on @entity120 led them to feel incapacitated in large crowds			0
the roles of the individuals arrested today and the bogus claims that they allegedly made have yet to be explicitly laid out			1
when the @entity14 's office made their case in january , they released photos of some of the accused blatantly showing off their wealth and behaving in ways that would been impossible if their disability claims were true			2
@entity135 , 48 , was held up by the @entity4 district attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam			1
rounding them up : the 28 new suspects are being brought into the @entity14 's office over the course of tuesday - many of whom are now in the custody of their former colleagues walk of shame : this new suspect tries to hide his face using an @entity152 hat the former police officer was living in a rented $ 1.5million waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parked his two jet skis at the time of his arrest			2
the officers were not the only ones in on the scheme , as @entity165 reports that some of the accused ' siblings pulled the same move			0
@entity169 is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters , and his siblings @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job			0
all told , the @entity180 siblings collected $ 596,000 - with the largest portion - $ 287,000 - going to @entity174 as he began making disability claims in 2002			2
@entity169 , 43 , collected $ 148,000 and the remaining $ 161,000 was split between @entity173 , @entity182 and @entity172			0
many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail , including @entity169 who posted a motivational video online ( which has now been removed ) where he talked about ways to get rich quick			0
sending a message : @entity135 is pictured on a jet ski , clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing			0
he was one of the original 102 people caught in the first bust in january not so afraid of crowds now : @entity195 , who said his post- 9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working , collected $ 108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed @entity200 festival busted : @entity201 ( left ) collected $ 232,443 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot and @entity205 ( right ) worked as a martial arts instructor while collecting $ 470,395 from @entity91 active : @entity208 collected a total of $ 207639 since may 2008 another such example was that of @entity195 , who told authorities that his work after the september 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds			1
on @entity216 , he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded @entity218 in @entity219			0
the suspicion is that there were a handful of ' crooked ' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to ' game the system '			0
the four alleged ' ringleaders ' were identified first , and it is clear that their positions within the @entity42 and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years			2
participants would start out by contacting @entity236 , 61 , a @entity238 consultant , or @entity239 , 64 , a retired member of the @entity42			1
@entity240 or @entity241 would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme - @entity245 , 89 , and former @entity248 agent @entity247 , 83			0
all four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny			0
the 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in , as @entity255 reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988			2
the lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors - but not after some coaching .			0

dozens more arrested in social security disability scam totaled $ 400million
of those arrested today , 16 were retired @entity42 officers , four were *ex-firefighters* , one worked for both @entity42 and @entity268 among others
comes after more than 100 other former @entity4 police officers and firefighters were arrested in january
were ' coached ' on how to appear to be suffering from ptsd and other physical and psychological conditions
some claimed that their disabilities stemmed from 9/11 clean up
