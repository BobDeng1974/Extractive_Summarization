a spirited @entity1 side inspired by @entity2 came up just short against a @entity4 outfit that held on for an opening day @entity6 win			1
@entity8 ’s side gave as good as they got for most of the match but five penalties from @entity11 secured the win for the @entity4			1
@entity1 replacement winger @entity13 was both saint and sinner for the @entity15			1
it was his try from a pass from prop @entity18 that gave @entity1 hope			2
but it was also his indiscipline when he threw the ball away in frustration gave the home side three easy , vital points			0
@entity1 replacement @entity13 finishes off a superb attack to crash over in the corner just before half - time @entity31 fly half @entity11 , who kicked five penalties for his side , clears under pressure from @entity1 prop @entity18 ( left ) @entity31 skipper @entity36 ( right ) grimaces as his pack set up a driving maul against the @entity15 @entity31 xv : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity36 , @entity51 , @entity52 replacements : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 penalties : @entity44 ( 5 ) @entity1 xv : @entity2 ; @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity18 , @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			1

tries : fife penalties : @entity68 ( 1 ) despite the defeat the spirit shown by the @entity15 in @entity89 is a good omen for the rest of the @entity6			2
as for the @entity4 they struggled to find the right tempo and only the kicking of @entity44 kept the scoreboard ticking over for them @entity1 got off to the worst possible start when @entity99 was penalised for holding on which gave @entity11 an easy penalty to open the scoring			1
captain @entity68 drew the scores level with one of his own after the @entity4 collapsed a scrum			0
@entity44 increased the home sides lead with a penalty from in front of the posts just before @entity1 were dealt a major blow when winger @entity111 went off with a hip injury after just 17 minutes to be replaced by @entity13			1
@entity2 ’s penalty attempt from within his own half drifted aimlessly wide but even attempting a kick from so far out showed the confidence the @entity1 full - back was showing			1
minutes later @entity2 was at it again with his jinking run nearly leading to a @entity1 try			2
after four phases of attacking play @entity67 made a real hash of a relatively simple drop goal attempt			0
@entity2 was nearly in at the corner in another move with the full - back held up just short			2
three minutes before the break @entity44 put over his third penalty of the match			0
@entity2 was again at the heart of the action starting a sweeping move that ended with prop @entity18 playing in replacement @entity84 for a try			0
@entity68 ’s conversion attempt came back off a post			0
@entity31 scrum half @entity45 winds up a box kick during the opening exchanges at the @entity31 the @entity4 tried their best to take the game to the @entity15 early in the second half but struggled to find a way through			1
try scorer @entity84 then gifted @entity31 three points when he threw the ball away in frustration and was penalised by referee @entity148			2
@entity44 made the most of the @entity1 ’s petulance by putting over his fourth penalty			0
he missed his fifth attempt that came back off a post but the @entity4 had the upperhand			0
@entity31 lock @entity49 rises high to claim a re-start under pressure from @entity1 winger @entity66 @entity1 scrum half @entity68 gets his side on the scoreboard from the kicking tee the @entity1 cause was n’t helped when @entity75 was yellow carded just after the hour mark for pulling down a maul			1
the small margins between success and failure came when @entity66 just failed to connect to a pass that was taken off his fingers by @entity40			0
the @entity4 winger sped up the line only for a great tackle from @entity64 to stop him			0
@entity1 were always in the running but were dealt a hammer blow two minutes from time when @entity44 put over his fifth penalty			2
@entity1 centre @entity64 rides the tackle of @entity42 while trying to offload to replacement fife fly half @entity67 takes the direct route into the @entity4 defence and is tackled by @entity49 ( left ) @entity182 tries to stretch his legs in open play but @entity64 puts in a strong tackle on the winger @entity2 ( right ) puts in a strong fend on @entity31 full back @entity39 during the @entity89 clash @entity190 lock @entity189 is enveloped in the double tackle of @entity192 ( left ) and @entity41 ( from left to right ) @entity193 , @entity189 , @entity64 and @entity84 ponder what might have been following their 15 - 8 loss in @entity89			1

@entity11 **'s** five penalties were enough to secure *victory* for @entity31
replacement back @entity13 crossed for @entity1 just before half - time
@entity8 **'s** *young* side impressed throughout the tight *contest*
hosts broke away from over fifty years of *tradition* by wearing red against the @entity15
