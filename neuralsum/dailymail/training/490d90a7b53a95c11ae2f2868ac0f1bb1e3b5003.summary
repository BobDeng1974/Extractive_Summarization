scientists have created a machine with the potential to read our dreams while we sleep			1
researchers in the @entity6 say it is so powerful that it can extract images from people ’s brains and display them on a screen			1
the data from the brain scanner has already been used to detect and reconstruct images of faces that people are thinking of			1
researchers believe the same technology could be used in the future to enable them to reconstruct images from people ’s memories , imagination and dreams			1
scientists say they have created a machine with the potential to read dreams during sleep ( library image ) it could also possibly be used to collect images of criminals from the minds of witnesses			1
@entity37 , a neuroscientist at the @entity38 , said : ‘ our methods yield strikingly accurate neural reconstructions of faces			0
‘ this represents a novel and promising approach for investigating face perception , but also suggests avenues for reconstructing ‘ offline ’ visual experiences — including dreams , memories and imagination			1
’ six volunteers were shown 300 faces while they laid inside an mri scanner			0
scientists were then able to analyse how their brains responded to dozens of different facial features including blond hair and blue eyes to dark skin and beards			2
when they had compiled a database of responses , they showed the volunteers a new set of faces and measured their reaction to each image			0
by comparing the second responses to the database , they were able to reconstruct the image they were looking at			2
the research is based on a theory that all human processes have a ‘ neural correlate ’ and that thoughts and feelings are merely a complex pattern of chemical reactions			0
some neuroscientists believe there is the potential to read such patterns if they can only build sensitive enough instruments			0

mr @entity90 said : ‘ i study memory , and it ’s hard not to be excited by the prospect of being able to reconstruct the images that we bring to mind when we remember something			1
‘ we are certainly heading in the direction of reconstructing dreams too			0
something that looks like a high - definition movie of your dreams is not going to happen in the immediate future , but we have already seen improvements in the sensitivity of these methods			1
’ mr @entity37 assured the public that the technology did not enable them to forcibly extract information from subjects , however			0
he told @entity121 : ‘ this sort of technology can only read active parts of the brain			2
so you could n’t read passive memories – you would have to get the person to imagine the memory to read it			2
‘ it ’s a matter of time , and eventually – maybe 200 years from now – we ’ll have some way of reading inactive parts of the brain			0
‘ but that ’s a much harder problem , as it involves measuring very fine details of brain structure that we do n’t even really understand			0
