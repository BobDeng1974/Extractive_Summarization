# @entity18 ' , reads the caption			0
eyebrow raising : @entity1 ( pictured ) has sparked controversy after this photo appeared on her boyfriend @entity8 's @entity7 account , captioned ' my awesome girlfriend			1
# @entity18 ' happy couple : @entity8 ( left ) followed the gun - toting photo of his sweetheart with a series of loved up snaps of himself and @entity1 looking happy as can be together ( pictured ) the photo seems to have been taken in a gun store , and has attracted a predictable wash of debate , with users taking to the comments section to vent their views			1
' is n't that the kind of guns they give soldiers who are at war ? no wars going on in @entity42			0
people who think it 's okay to keep weapons like this in their homes scare me ' , wrote one user			2
i 'm glad she knows how to defend herself ... btw , if you wait for the police to defend you , you will die waiting			0
@entity55 on the other hand will lock and load ' , wrote another			0
one commenter posed the frank question : ' wow , would @entity60 carry that weapon ? ' to which another responded with a specific reference to the @entity64 : ' @entity60 would carry that , were he walking among us today			0
he exhorts his followers to buy the best personal defense weapon of the day , the sword , even if they had to sell their only cloak to get one			0
' strong views : @entity8 is a strict conservative @entity10 who stands firmly behind the @entity75 , which allows for gun ownership , and staunchly against abortion it is n't the first time the @entity81 family have come under fire for their gun - related antics			1
in 2011 , 23 - year - old @entity81 , the family 's third eldest sibling , was photographed posing with two large rifles hugged to his chest , along with his exchange student friend , before heading out to target practice			1
' we believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives ' in response to the backlash , the @entity2 stressed that gun safety was a top priority in their house			2
guns are kept in a safe that can only be accessed by a few family members , they claim , and everyone who handles the guns has taken gun safety classes			1
' we believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives			0
to learn how to use them properly and to learn not to use them to hurt others but to use them as a tool ' , @entity110 , the 48 - year - old family patriarch told @entity115			1
previous antics : in 2011 , this photo of @entity1 's brother , 23 - year - old @entity81 ( left ) , posing with two rifles , also caused a negative backlash pro-guns : the @entity2 parents ( pictured ) have previously been vocal with their views about gun ownership , with @entity110 ( left ) once saying , ' it ’s really not the gun or the knife , it ’s the person that has it in their hands ' @entity110 has also likened guns to knives in the past , saying : ' we ’ve all used knives to cut a steak or open a box			1
it ’s really not the gun or the knife , it ’s the person that has it in their hands			2
' ' @entity60 is everything to me			0
without @entity146 , i am nothing ' since posting the controversial photo of his rifle - welding sweetheart , @entity8 - whose @entity7 profile summary reads : ' @entity60 is everything to me			2
without him , i am nothing ' - has been busy sharing a series of loved up photos of himself and @entity1 , with captions including : ' love you , @entity159 ! ' and , ' spending the day with my sweetheart ! ' also appearing are several of @entity8 's commonly dropped pro-life references , such as : ' abortion is a matter of life and death			1
we must abolish abortion ! ' according to the @entity2 's views on dating , @entity1 and @entity8 are just ' courting ' for now , which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates			1
the @entity2 , from @entity174 , @entity175 , see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families			2
only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time , but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss			0
marriage on the cards ? @entity1 recently launched official @entity192 and @entity193 accounts in which she takes on @entity8 's last name , identifying herself as ' @entity195 ' last month , the couple went on a double date with @entity8 's parents , and @entity1 spoke to @entity8 's father about her initial feelings for his son			1
' i noticed him right off			0
i was like , " hmm , he seems like a nice guy , " but i never really consider a guy unless he 's approached my dad ' , she said			2
' definitely in the early stages of our friendship , i thought he was a great guy , ' she continued			0
' but i 'm that type of person that i 'm not going to get emotional or like daydream about [ a guy ] unless he really expresses his interest			0
i 'm not gon na set my expectations on anything happening			0
' family portrait : @entity110 ( center right ) once said of his 19 - strong brood , ' people think we are overpopulating the world [ but ] we are following our convictions ' although an official engagement has n't yet been announced , two weeks ago , @entity1 opened official @entity192 and @entity193 accounts with the name ' @entity195 ' - the pair 's biggest hint yet that marriage may be just around the corner			1
the @entity81 family are considered representative of the @entity232 movement which teaches that ' children are @entity235 ’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given			2
' addressing their critics , @entity110 once said : ' people think we are overpopulating the world [ but ] we are following our convictions			0
