for a man who really did not want to talk on saturday evening , @entity0 woke on sunday having had a serious re-think , invited himself on to @entity3 and let loose			1
while admitting he might be talking his way to a touchline ban , the @entity5 manager launched a live verbal assault from his position on the @entity10 on sunday sofa , taking aim at various targets which included an attack on @entity3 ’s own coverage			1
it was very neatly planned and executed by a man employed as an ambassador for rival broadcasters @entity19 , and @entity20 , the show ’s scheduled guest , was nowhere to be seen			2
@entity0 says the incidents in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity24 were ' clear for everyone , not just me ' @entity0 says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they ca n't get decisions right ' @entity0 is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign , but entitled to ask questions			1
his players , fine players , are frequently under siege			0
' click here to read @entity37 's chief sports writer @entity36 on @entity0 's @entity10 on sunday appearance @entity0 has bemoaned these things for weeks but @entity24 striker @entity40 and referee @entity41 pushed him over the edge as @entity5 dropped precious points in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity45 on saturday			1
he lashed out at @entity40 , branding his tackle on @entity46 ‘ criminal ’ and ‘ career - ending ’ and recalled for the audience a seven - match ban imposed on the striker two years ago when he tripped a referee while playing for @entity50 against @entity51			1
and he called for more technology to help officials who ‘ ca n’t see a penalty three metres in front of him ’ and claimed @entity5 were ‘ not getting the respect they deserve ’ with a long sequence of bad decisions			1
it was an incredible performance , even by @entity0 standards of showmanship and revolved around his four chosen moments from the @entity24 game : two failed penalty appeals and two challenges by @entity40			1
‘ what can i say that everybody does n’t know ? ’ the @entity5 manager began			1
‘ sometimes there is space for discussion where you have one view and i have another , but i ca n’t believe these four incidents are open to interpretation			2
this studs - up tackle from @entity40 infuriated @entity46 and @entity0 backed up his player @entity46 's reaction to @entity40 's tackle earned the @entity82 a red card - he 'll now miss the @entity85 final @entity0 shot from the lip during his surprise appearance on goals on sunday on @entity3 ‘ at half - time @entity24 should be playing with 10 men and @entity5 should have had two penalties and be winning 3 - 0 , or let ’s say 2 - 0 if we miss one of the penalties			1
the reality is that in the end we end the game with 10 men and we lose two points			0
’ the first penalty appeal was for handball when a shot by @entity104 crashed into @entity106 ’s outstretched arm			2
‘ the arm stopped the ball hitting the target , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s far away ; it ’s not one metre , not a few inches , it ’s quite far			0
players should be taught to keep balance even in difficult situations , making difficult bio-mechanical actions and putting their arms behind the body to avoid this			0
for me , this is a penalty everywhere			2
‘ the best players in the world make mistakes , they miss penalties , and this gentleman is one of the top referees in this country and @entity128 and he can also make mistakes			0
he made four important mistakes			0
it is consistent but we must search for consistency in the right way			0
the lawyer who has lost 15 cases out of 15 is consistent but you do n’t want that lawyer			0
’ the second penalty appeal was for a push by @entity141 on @entity142 , but @entity0 went back to the opening game of the @entity145 campaign when his centre forward was booked for a dive at @entity148			1
@entity0 requested to go on @entity10 on sunday and planned guest @entity20 had to make way @entity41 , the referee for @entity5 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity24 , was criticised for his decisions on saturday ‘ the penalty story with @entity142 started on day one , because it is a penalty and a red card for the goalkeeper , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity156 — also one of the top referees in the country and soon to be one of the best in @entity128 — gives a yellow card to @entity142 and a free - kick against @entity5			1
’ during the course of this 29 - minute section of the show , he noted other penalties his team deserved but did not get — against @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 — and insisted only once had he benefited from a dubious decision , when @entity172 escaped a handball at @entity169			2
‘ probably i am risking my place in the dug - out in the final because i risk being suspended by having this conversation in a studio , ’ @entity0 went on			1
‘ i know in football sometimes you get them and sometimes you do n’t but it ’s too much			0
i try to be calm and controlled but my players are not getting the respect they deserve			0
’ when it came to analysing the @entity40 challenges , one on @entity104 and one on @entity46 , which provoked his dismissal for a retaliatory shove , the @entity5 manager said : ‘ this @entity24 player involved in two actions has a grey past			1
there was a very dark point in his career when he was at @entity50 and suspended for seven matches , because of a big incident with a referee			2
@entity0 appeared to be agitated during the game too , airing his frustrations to media after the match the @entity5 boss was particularly unhappy with the performance of referee @entity41 ‘ should this player be chased because of what he did in the past ? i do n’t think so			1
when people look at these two incidents i hope they only see these two incidents			0
i do n’t think it should have any relation with his history			0
‘ when i see @entity142 on day one in the @entity145 , penalty and red card to the goalkeeper , game over 2 - 0 , transformed into a free - kick and yellow for @entity142 , i think he has changed country but brought with him his past in the eyes of the officials			1
this is clearly not fair			0
‘ when i finish the game against @entity169 and go to the dressing room , the first thing i see on the big screen we have in the dressing room is about @entity142 ’s ‘ crimes ’			0
well , i would like to know how @entity3 describe the actions of the @entity24 player yesterday when you call what @entity142 did a crime			0
’ with his sidekick @entity240 struck by temporary paralysis beside him , @entity3 host @entity239 admitted there may have been a mistake with the language in the immediate aftermath of @entity142 ’s stamp on @entity249 , in the @entity85 semi-final , which prompted a three - match ban			2
@entity0 covered a range of subjects during his appearance on @entity10 on sunday ‘ did you apologise to @entity5 or to @entity142 or to me as @entity5 manager ? ’ asked @entity0			1
i do n’t like the use of language and do n’t like it that immediately there is public judgment			0
‘ you give no space to the people who have to decide			0
the pressure was so much that it gave no space and you do n’t do this with every club and every player			0
when you say @entity142 ’s “ crimes ” because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle , minimum			2
when @entity142 had a three - match ban , tell me how many matches you think this player deserves			2
‘ what happened was similar to what happened to @entity286 at @entity287 but i would say yesterday was worse because this was “ end of career ” , i ca n’t find an adjective any stronger than to say “ end of career ”			1
@entity46 is a lucky guy			0
i ca n’t find words to describe what that player did			2
‘ @entity46 had reason to lose his emotions			0
what are the consequences of @entity46 ’s push on the other player ? nothing			0
one second later , he stands and goes			0
the consequence for @entity46 could be the end of career			2
’ @entity0 did not appear satisfied with a post-match conversation he had with @entity41 at @entity45 on saturday			1
‘ i am not attacking the honesty of anyone , ’ he added			0
‘ i am not trying to bring the game into disrepute — a sentence you love in this country because this is always what they use when they want to punish me			0
i ’m just trying to be honest			0
‘ of course , they are trying but they are not doing it well			0
if the ref ca n’t see a penalty three metres in front of him some referee in front of a screen ca n’t miss it			1
it will protect the integrity and honesty of the referees			0
i think technology can help			2
’ @entity0 stuck around with @entity239 and @entity240 to analyse the rest of the saturday action but by then he had got what he wanted to off his chest			1
30 - @entity40 sends @entity104 crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back			1
@entity104 rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken			0
it should have been a free - kick and could have been a yellow card for @entity40			1
@entity40 catches @entity104 with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute 33 - @entity104 goes for goal but @entity106 diverts it with an outstretched arm , as he turns his back to goal			1
it should have been a @entity5 penalty			1
@entity104 fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity106 43 - @entity142 goes to ground after @entity141 leans into him with an oustretched arm			0
it could have been a @entity5 penalty but would have been soft			1
@entity142 vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by @entity141 69 - @entity40 misses the ball and almost snaps @entity46 's left shin with his studs but @entity41 waves play on			1
an enraged @entity46 leaps up and pushes @entity40 over			2
@entity41 sends off @entity46 and books @entity104 for trying to take red card out of his hand			0
it was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for @entity40 and a @entity5 free - kick			1
referee @entity41 shows @entity46 a straight red card after his altercation with @entity40 in the second half			2

@entity0 specifically asked to be a guest on @entity10 on sunday
the @entity5 boss spoke about @entity40 's ' career - ending tackle '
he also called for more technology to help officials ' who ca n't see a penalty three metres in front of him '
