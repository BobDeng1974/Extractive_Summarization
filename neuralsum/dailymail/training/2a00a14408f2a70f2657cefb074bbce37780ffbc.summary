supermarket chain @entity0 has been forced to apologise for turning the @entity1 into a giant advert for @entity4 stick			1
the store , which is desperate to claw back customers from budget competitors @entity8 and @entity9 , used a projector to beam a 175ft - long baguette onto the famous artwork			1
but the piece of bread , which had a the phrase ' i 'm cheaper ' beamed on to it to reflect recent price cuts , angered many people , who thought it devalued the artwork			2
' defiled ' : @entity0 has apologised for projected a 175ft baguette onto the @entity1 in @entity22 , @entity23 the response to the stunt - which was set up without permission - was led by sculptor @entity27 , who designed the huge , steel statue , which has stood in by the @entity29 in @entity22 , @entity23 , since 1998			1
he told the @entity30 : ' i 'd rather the @entity1 is not used for such purposes , but it 's out there '			0
meanwhile , hundreds of social media users who had seen an image posted by @entity0 on saturday evening , formed a chorus of disapproval			2
one tweeted that the supermarket had ' defiled ' the angel , while others described the move as ' philistine and disgraceful '			2
many threatened to boycott the supermarket as a response			0
@entity22 council , which maintains the sculpture , said that it was ' disappointed ' by the advert , which did not follow its usual procedures for product placement			1
original : the @entity1 has stood next to the @entity29 since 1998 permission : @entity22 council has said it was ' disappointed ' that the stunt took place a spokesman said : ' many goods and services have and want to be profiled alongside it , and there is a filming process in place to work with organisations to do this , although this does not include lighting the @entity65 in any way			1
' it is disappointing this process does not appear to have been followed			0
' in light of the backlash from the gimmick , @entity0 apologised for the tactic , which it hoped would be ' something different '			2
he said : ' we ’re sorry if people thought we got carried away by shining a baguette on the @entity1 and apologise unreservedly to those to whom we have caused offence			2
' we were trying something different which was meant to put a smile on people ’s faces but clearly it was n’t to everybody ’s tastes			0
' we ’re so proud of our northern roots and the last thing we want to do is offend anybody			0
' when it is not being commandeered to advertise baguettes , the @entity1 is celebrated as one of @entity91 's best - known pieces of public art. the sculpture , designed by @entity27 , stands not far from the @entity29 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
it was built between 1994 and 1998			0
at 175ft wide , its wingspan exceeds that of a @entity97 757			0
the steel statue weighs 208 tonnes and is 65ft high			0
its structure is so stable that it only needs to be inspected once every seven years			0
the statue - which @entity22 council claims is the largest representation of an angel in the world - stands on top of a disused mine			1
mr @entity27 said that its location helped evoke the region 's industrial past , commemorating the hard work and struggles of two centuries of miners , but that it was also meant to mark @entity91 's transition into the future .			1
