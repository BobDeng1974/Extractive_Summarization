he is barely out of university , but this bright young graduate has come up with an invention that could save countless lives			2
@entity6 inventor @entity5 , 23 , has created a baby ’s incubator which can be manufactured for £ 250 ( $ 395 )			1
the inflatable device could transform healthcare in poor countries , where the normal £ 30,000 ( $ 47,500 ) price of an incubator is unaffordable to all but the most advanced hospitals			1
@entity5 , 23 , graduated from @entity18 in the summer and was awarded the @entity19 this week			1
incubators can cost £ 30,000 ( $ 47,500 )			1
but mr @entity5 ' invention can be made for just £ 250 ( $ 395 ) it might also be one day used as a portable device by paramedics in the @entity6 , or even as a standby in hospitals			1
mr @entity5 , who graduated from @entity18 in the summer , awarded the @entity19 for design engineers this week			1
the young inventor , who sold his car to fund the prototype , beat competitors from 18 different countries to win the prestigious prize			2
a champagne cork - like device that nurtures fledgling embryos inside a woman ’s body could halve the cost of @entity40 , doctors believe			2
this would give many more women the chances of fulfilling their dream of motherhood			0
the clear plastic mini-incubator would also make @entity40 quicker , easier and more natural , the @entity47 ’s annual conference in @entity48 heard			0
in a pilot study , women treated using the @entity52 device were just as likely to become pregnant as others			0
nine babies have been born so far using the new technique			0
mr @entity5 , from @entity57 in @entity58 , will spend his £ 30,000 ( $ 47,500 ) prize fund on clinical trials for his machine , which he hopes will eventually be adopted in @entity6 hospitals and aboard			1
one in ten babies around the world are born prematurely			0
being placed in an incubating machine which regulates temperature and oxygen flow is vital for tiny babies ’ survival			0
mr @entity5 , who gained a levels in maths , physics and design at the private @entity74 in @entity57 , before started a product design degree at @entity76 , said he was appalled at the cost of a modern incubator			1
‘ there is no need for them to be so expensive , ’ he said			0
‘ they are built with very expensive materials and have lots of features you do n’t necessarily need , like weight scales and oxygen sensors			0
’ mr @entity5 ' design might also be one day used as a portable device by paramedics in the @entity6 , and it could also be used in developing countries and disaster zones			1
sir @entity94 said it could save ' thousands of lives '			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity57 in @entity58 , will spend his £ 30,000 ( $ 47,500 ) prize fund on clinical trials for his machine , which he hopes will eventually be adopted in @entity6 hospitals and aboard he looked at every competent of a state - of - the art incubator and came up with cheaper replacements - ending up with a machine that could be created for less than a hundredth of the price			1
his main cost saving was achieved by replacing the normal aluminium and rigid glass or plastic frame with a plastic inflatable body			2
he also replaced the humidifiers and temperature controls with cheaper parts and tore out anything not absolutely necessary			0
the machine , which he called @entity117 , ended up with a machine that is portable and cheap			2
it is heated using ceramic elements , has a digital screen to monitor temperature and humidity , an alarm that sounds if the temperature changes , and special lighting for babies with jaundice			0
it has already passed engineering tests , but must also undergo stringent medical testing before it is used in the field			0
mr @entity5 , who gained a levels in maths , physics and design at the private @entity74 in @entity57 , before started a product design degree at @entity76 , said he was appalled at the cost of a modern incubator			2
‘ there is no need for them to be so expensive , ’ he said the design has won the approval of experts in the field			0
dr @entity147 , consultant pediatrician at the @entity148 in @entity149 said : ‘ @entity117 is a really interesting piece of innovation - i particularly like the integration of phototherapy , as jaundice is a very common co-morbidity alongside prematurity			0
‘ its use need n’t be limited to developing world scenarios			0
i could see it being used in the @entity6 to support community midwifery units , or following home births			2
’ sir @entity94 , who launched his award after achieving commercial success with his bagless vacuum cleaners , said : ‘ @entity5 ’ invention shows the impact design engineering can have on people ’s lives			1
‘ the western world takes incubators for granted - we do n’t think about how their inefficient design makes them unusable in developing countries and disaster zones			1
by bravely challenging convention , @entity5 has created something that could save thousands of lives			1

@entity6 inventor has created a cheap and inflatable baby incubator
