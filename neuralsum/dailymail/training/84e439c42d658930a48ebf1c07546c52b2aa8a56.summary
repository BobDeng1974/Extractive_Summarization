burglars are marking houses as targets for break - ins with small , transparent stickers advertising a locksmith			1

police in @entity11 have already linked one burglary to the stickers			1
they have received dozens of complaints from residents across the capital who have found them on their doors			0
scam : the stickers - which have already been linked to one local burglary - are printed with the words ' 24/7 locksmith - repair installation locked out ' and a fake telephone number of 0203 582 8175 officers believe that ‘ scouts ’ place the stickers on properties they deem to be vulnerable , after checking whether the owners are at home during the day and if windows and doors are locked			1
it is thought the stickers were designed so that if a scout is apprehended while marking a house , they can claim they are simply handing out advertising material			2
a spokesman for @entity41 in south - west @entity11 said : ‘ these stickers are clearly not for advertising purposes			1
‘ they ’re not going next to the lock where you may notice them and the phone number has never existed			0
