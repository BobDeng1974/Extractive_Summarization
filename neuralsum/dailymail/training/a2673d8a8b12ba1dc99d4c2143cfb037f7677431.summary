stare at this black and white wheel long enough and you may see a colour appear out of nowhere			1
but incredibly , different people see different colours - and some may not see anything at all			1
many people say they see green , others see yellow and a few see red , but exactly why this is the case has baffled scientists for decades			1
cut the circles , making it as round as you can and poke a hole in the centre with a toothpick			2
insert the toothpick into the hole			2
the toothpick should stick out about half an inch			0
break or cut the toothpick in half			0
twist the toothpick to spin the spinner			0
next , download and print out one of the @entity37 graphics from here			0
you can stick these graphics on your spinner and then use the toothpick on a flat surface to spin the wheel and create your own illusion			2
the wheel is called @entity46 's top and it creates an illusion of colour when black and white patterns rapidly change , as reported by @entity50 on @entity51			1
it is named after the @entity54 - born toymaker @entity46 , who , in 1895 , created a top painted with the pattern shown			1
when the wheel is spun , arcs of subtle colour , called @entity17 colours , are visible at different areas on the surface			2
one theory about why people see different colours is that the receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red , green , and blue			1
@entity46 's top is currently being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye the higher the speed , the more obvious the colour effect and reversing the wheel can also change the shade			1
one theory about why people see different colours is that the receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red , green , and blue			1
the retina of the eye is composed of two types of receptors sensitive to light : cones and rods			2
cones are important for colour vision and for seeing in bright light			2
there are three types of cones , each of which is most sensitive to a particular wavelength of light			0
‘ it is possible that the colours seen in spinning @entity46 disks are the result of changes that occur in the retina and other parts of the visual system , ’ according to @entity103			1
‘ for example , the spinning disks may activate neighbouring areas of the retina differently			0
in other words , the black and white areas of the disk stimulate different parts of the retina			0
’ this response may cause a type of changes within the nervous system that creates colours , scientists believe			0
another theory is that different cones stay activated for different amounts of time			0
this means , when the wheel is spun , the white areas activate all three types of cones , and then the black deactivates them			0
the sequence may cause an imbalance because the different types of cones take different times to respond , resulting in the brain producing different colours			0
while these theories do not explain the illusion completely , @entity46 's top is currently being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye .			1

@entity144 named @entity46 's top after @entity54 - born toymaker @entity46
some people see green , a few yellow or red and others no colour at all
exactly why illusion looks different to different people is still a *mystery*
@entity46 's top is being researched for use as a tool to identify eye disease
