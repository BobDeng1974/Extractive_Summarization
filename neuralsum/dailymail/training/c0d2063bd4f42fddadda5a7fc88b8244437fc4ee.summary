by @entity0 the @entity1 famously won @entity3 's ' dirtiest hotel in @entity5 ' award three times in a year , but now there are buyers bidding to snap up the @entity10 accommodation with the price expected to reach $ 180million ( £ 107million )			1
the 600 - room hotel , just off @entity13 on west 43rd street , has had bug infestations , was the site of a murder in 2007 and has violated 15 building codes from uncharged fire extinguishers and exit signs that do n't light up to lifts that were overdue for inspection			1
@entity22 , who has been handling the sale , told @entity24 : ' it 's the dirtiest , and best located hotel in @entity10			1
it was under - managed and neglected			0
' key location : the @entity1 is expected to sell for £ 107million , despite its questionable reputation for cleanliness in need of an upgrade : the bathrooms were pictured with stains and mould when the @entity1 won the ' dirtiest hotel in @entity5 ' title for the third time in 2009 first opened in the 1930s as the @entity38 , it was famed as an affordable @entity10 location , but in recent years the two - star accommodation had insect infestations , bed bugs and even used discarded hospital linens for its bedding			1
in 2007 , a woman in her 20s was found dead in room 608 , with her head and legs wrapped in plastic bags			2
@entity51 owned the hotel from 1977 but died in 2012 , which prompted a temporary administrator to step in while it was decided what to do with the property			2
@entity57 , from @entity58 , took over with 15 building code violations in various stages of being addressed , rooms cost $ 99 ( £ 59 ) a night with the bizarre tag - line ' you wanted in @entity63 ' room for the night : the @entity1 has more than 600 rooms of varying quality prime position : the hotel will sell for £ 107million for its location in @entity10 , but will need a £ 75million upgrade a total of 25 bidders were interested in the hotel , but it has now been narrowed to a final few and the property is expected to sell for around $ 180million ( £ 107million ) , with the buyer committing to a full renovation at a cost of $ 100 - 125million ( £ 60 - 75million )			1
mr @entity22 has confirmed the hotel will remain independent			0
the hotel last scooped the ' dirtiest ' award from @entity3 in 2009 , but the awards were scrapped altogether in 2012			1
however , customers have left mixed comments on the review website , with more than one thousands rating it as ' terrible '			0
@entity87 left the comment : ' the hotel is less than 5 minutes away from @entity13			2
so i do n't think anyone could complain about its location			0
the rooms however were somewhat filthy			0
i 've stayed in a lot of motels throughout the @entity5 , with much higher hygiene levels			2
the floors were dirty and the bathtub stained			0
