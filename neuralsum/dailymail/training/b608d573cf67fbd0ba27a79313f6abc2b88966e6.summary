low - calorie artificial sweeteners found in diet drinks actually ' raise the risk of diabetes and obesity ' millions rely on them to help them stay thin			1
but low - calorie artificial sweeteners actually raise the risk of obesity , researchers fear			1
the popular sugar alternatives found in diet drinks and in sachets in cafes and restaurants may also increase the odds of diabetes			1
the sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin , which is found in @entity19 , sucralose , which is found in @entity21 , and aspartame , which is found in many diet drinks			1
the @entity25 researchers that ‘ today ’s massive , unsupervised consumption ’ of artificial sweeteners needs to be reassessed			1
the warning at a time when growing concern about the damage done by sugar is likely to mean more people are switching to artificial alternatives			2
@entity36 experts urged caution , saying that much of the work was done in mice			0
but they also said that water is the healthiest drink			0
the researchers , from the @entity43 , first showed that all three sweeteners made it more difficult for mice to process sugar			1
this is known as glucose intolerance and is important because it raises risk of developing diabetes and obesity			1
in a study of almost 400 people , the researchers linked artificial sweetener with being fatter and glucose intolerance			1
and , worryingly , volunteers who did n’t normally eat or drink artificially - sweetened foods began to become glucose intolerant after just four days of consumption			2
the numbers affected were small – just four out of seven men and women in the trial – but the research overall was judged significant enough to be published in nature one of the world ’s most prestigious scientific journals			0
other experiments suggested the sweeteners do the damage by altering type of bacteria in the gut			0
while this might seem odd , some of the bugs that live naturally in our digestive system are very good at breaking down food			0
if they thrive on artificial sweeteners , this could lead to more energy being extracted from food and more fat being stored – raising the odds of obesity			1
lead researcher professor @entity90 , said : ‘ our relationship with our own individual mix of gut bacteria is a huge factor in determining how the food we eat affects us			0
‘ especially intriguing is the link between use of artificial sweeteners - through the bacteria in our guts - to a tendency to develop the very disorders they were designed to prevent			1
‘ this calls for reassessment of today 's massive , unsupervised consumption of these substances			1
’ the professor has stopped using artificial sweeteners			2
he has also removed sugar from his diet – but says it is too early to make health recommendations based on his study			2
dr @entity116 , a diabetes expert from the @entity117 , said that larger - scale human studies are ‘ urgently required ’			2
she added : ‘ meanwhile , these findings support the widespread understanding that water is the healthiest drink option and that we should avoid sweet and sweetened drinks			0
‘ @entity125 is the best drink to control our blood sugar			0
’ others urged caution – and pointed out that most of the work was done on mice			0
the sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin , which is found in @entity19 , sucralose , which is found in @entity21 , and aspartame , which is found in many diet drinks			1
but the @entity36 @entity138 said research contradicts ‘ the overwhelming body of scientific evidence ’ @entity142 , chief dietician at @entity143 in @entity144 , said : ‘ if you are a human trying to lose weight , you need to lose calories from your diet			0
‘ low - calorie sweeteners help you reduce your calorie intake and it ’s a good lifestyle move for those wanting to lose weight			0
’ @entity153 , professor of nutrition at @entity155 , @entity156 , said that most of the experiments related to saccharin – which is rarely found in diet fizzy drinks			2
he said : ‘ there seems no reason to suggest that swopping to a diet version of your favourite fizzy drink is unwise			0
’ @entity165 , of the @entity36 @entity138 , said research contradicts ‘ the overwhelming body of scientific evidence ’			0
he said : ‘ more than 40 studies have concluded that the use of low - calorie sweeteners do not lead to either an increased risk of obesity or diabetes			2
‘ decades of clinical research show that low - calorie sweeteners , such as those in diet drinks , have been found to aid weight control when part of an overall healthy diet and assist with diabetes management			1
’ the @entity182 , which represents manufacturers including the maker of @entity21 , also strongly rejected the research .			0

sweeteners under fire include aspartame - found in many diet drinks
also saccharin , found in @entity19 and sucralose , found in @entity21
all three sweeteners made it more difficult for mice to process sugar
known as glucose intolerance , this raises risk of diabetes and obesity
' massive , unsupervised consumption of artificial sweeteners must change '
