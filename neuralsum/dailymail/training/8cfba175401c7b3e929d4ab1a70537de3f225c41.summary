sitting in front of your smart television , you may think you are the only one watching			2
but if you have agreed to the appliance ’s terms and conditions , the manufacturer may be spying on you , researchers claim			1
brands could be monitoring the programmes you watch , and the websites you browse , according to a study by which ? smart tv brands monitor the programmes you watch and the websites you browse to offer personalised recommendations for tv shows - but this information can be passed on to advertisers to target viewers more accurately which ? thinks that manufacturers could do more to keep their customers happy			1
it has asked companies to keep tv tracking to a minimum and to encrypt all data transmitted			2
to disclose what they are tracking and why			0
to allow customers to opt out of tracking and still use the smart tv functions they have paid for			2
to give consumers a choice about whether they see adverts on their homescreen			0
such monitoring could bring benefits such as more personalised recommendations for tv shows to watch			0
but it could also be used to let advertisers target people more accurately in their own home , which some may consider an invasion of their privacy			0
last year , it consultant @entity47 realised his @entity48 was tracking his family ’s viewing habits and even knew his children ’s names because he had watched a family video on his set			1
which ? magazine ’s more recent investigation explored how tvs from @entity48 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 track their owners			1
experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart tvs , and changed channel , searched the web and played videos from a usb stick to see what information was collected			1
they discovered that all the brands track people ’s viewing habits to some extent , although @entity48 has stopped temporarily			1
most of data collected was encrypted to hide it from hackers , but a @entity80 disclosed the tester ’s location and postcode for anyone to see			2
the firm told which ? that location is needed to operate the tv , but that a postcode is n’t required			0
last year , it consultant @entity47 realised his @entity48 was tracking his family ’s viewing habits and even knew his children ’s names because he had watched a family video on his set			1
an @entity48 set is pictured a previous study by the publication revealed that brands have abandoned support for some of the tvs that are a few years old – rendering them less smart because some apps ( illustrated ) could n't be accessed a team of scientists at @entity104 claimed in june that hybrid smart tvs that blur the line between televisions and the internet are vulnerable to a simple hack			1
coined the ‘ red - button attack ’ - named after the red button used on modern smart tv remotes to access additional content - the flaw can be exploited with a $ 250 ( £ 150 ) transmitter			1
in just minutes , someone using a smart tv could find their various internet accounts sending spam , printing coupons and writing fake reviews without their knowledge			2
hackers could , in theory , also use these accounts to harvest personal information			0
the attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in @entity130 ( @entity131 )			0
this ‘ allows broadcast streams to include embedded @entity136 content which is rendered by the television , ’ the researchers wrote in their paper			0
the hacker would then take over the channel a viewer was watching for a short amount of time			0
this would be done by using a simple amplifier , on a rooftop to hijack networks across an area of 0.5 square miles ( 1.4 square kilometres )			0
in doing so , the hacker would have access to any websites the viewer was logged into on their smart tv			2
this could range from getting access to their @entity157 accounts to writing fake reviews on websites for products			0
@entity58 , @entity48 , @entity60 and @entity61 all push adverts onto a tv ’s homescreen , and while users can stop them being targeted , they can not be blocked completely			1
people uncomfortable with data being collected about them may wish to decline their tv ’s terms and conditions , but this could leave them without much of the device ’s functionality			1
@entity60 blocks any functions that require internet access , while @entity61 and @entity48 block internet access and apps - but the basic functions of the tv are available to use			1
@entity58 reportedly stops all access to the tv set			1
@entity59 was the only brand studied that if a user rejects its terms , only blocks tracking so that a user loses content recommendations - without limiting other functions			1
a previous study by the publication revealed that brands have abandoned support for some of the @entity190 that are a few years old – rendering them less smart			2
which ? was contacted by @entity58 and @entity48 customers who bought their sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively			1
they were outraged after losing access to @entity196 , now called @entity196			0
when a tv manufacturer updates its smart tv range , the whole operating system it runs on can potentially change to incorporate new features			2
this means the people who make the apps may have to redesign and recode their services to make them compatible			0
manufacturers have to pay the developers for licenses to host the apps and show the content and , as a result , may choose to only cover app licenses for their newer products , and not their older ones			0
keeping apps such as @entity215 and @entity216 available on smart @entity190 requires agreement between the manufacturers and the third - party app providers			2
if they ca n't agree , or either party changes their technology or software , consumers can lose services			1
this also goes the other way - if a tv was sold before an app becomes available , it ’s unlikely the developers will ever make it backward compatible , meaning it will never work on models released before the app launched			1
if an older tv does n’t meet these requirements , customers will get a poorer experience and @entity216 could develop a reputation for providing a sub-standard service			0
according to the which ? investigation , ‘ manufacturers blame the app providers , the app providers blame the manufacturers , and the retailers blame everyone but themselves			0
‘ yet in the middle of this , consumers can lose out			0
since the product itself has n’t developed a physical fault , it ’s a grey area for consumer rights			0

which ? experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart tvs from @entity48 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61
they discovered all the brands track people ’s viewing habits to some extent
they are given permission to do this in the tv *'s* terms and conditions
if viewers reject conditions they ca n't access some features on their tv sets - and @entity58 and @entity61 owners ca n't use them at all
