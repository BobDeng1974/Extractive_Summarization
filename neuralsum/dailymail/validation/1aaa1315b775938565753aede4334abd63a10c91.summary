the impact of @entity3 extremism in @entity4 is now being felt across the @entity5 , maps charting the soaring number of terror arrests and convictions reveal			1
the almost weekly raids now being carried out by anti-terror police are taking place throughout @entity5 ; from the eastern port of @entity13 to the western town of @entity15 in @entity16 , and from @entity17 on the south coast to @entity19 and @entity20 in the @entity21			1
whether it is stopping would - be jihadis from travelling to the @entity24 , foiling planned plots when they return or disrupting their funding networks , the conflict in @entity4 has spawned a huge range of crimes for @entity5 authorities to deal with			1
a map charting the location of arrests made in response to the threat from @entity4 - linked extremism shows it is not an issue confined to big cities			1
as well as raids in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity19 , suspects have been detained in towns around the @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46			1
behind bars for waging jihad : the growing number of convictions of extremists from around @entity5 for crimes linked to @entity3 's war in @entity4 police estimated that , last year , up to five @entity5 a week travelled to @entity4 , making monitoring their movements on their return all the more difficult			1
meanwhile , the number of @entity4 - related terror arrests increased six-fold from just 25 in 2013 to 165 in 2014			1
the @entity58 said they are taking a ' cradle to the grave approach ' to disrupting terrorism and last month made arrests in relation to an alleged scam in which say cold callers swindled pensioners out of money to fund @entity3			1
senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing @entity70 said earlier this year : ' we have been running exceptionally high numbers of investigations , the likes of which we have not seen for many years			2
' several attack plots have been disrupted , of various sophistication , from individuals planning to carry out lone attacks to more complex conspiracies , the majority seemingly directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas			0
' the range of suspected offences which arrests were made for include funding terrorism , preparing or instigating acts of terrorism and attending a terrorist training camp			2
last may , father of two @entity92 , from @entity17 , became the first person in the @entity5 to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the @entity4 conflict			1
the 31 - year - old went to the @entity24 country with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp last october			1
since then , a string of further trials have taken place , with convictions of women funding boyfriends and husbands fighting abroad , groups returning from jihadi camps and others inspired by the violence to plot atrocities in the @entity5			1
web of terror : a map of the most high - profile terror arrests in the last six months shows the issue is not confined to @entity5 's big cities gathering evidence against foreign combatants poses extra challenges for the @entity122 , with lawyers often struggling to get reliable evidence from warzones or hostile authorities abroad			1
but @entity127 , deputy head of counter-terrorism at the @entity122 , told @entity129 the service is gathering expertise in how to prosecute returning militants			0
she said : ' whilst prosecuting acts undertaken in countries such as @entity4 always brings new and unique challenges , the existing success of our specialist prosecutors in securing convictions for offences committed abroad – for example in @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and more recently in @entity4 itself - demonstrates that we are ready and able to take these challenges on			2
' we work with police from an early stage in the investigation to ensure that wherever possible , international borders and areas of conflict are not a barrier to justice			2
' the former head of @entity156 warned last month that there are ' several thousand ' individuals of concern in @entity5 and demanded tougher anti-terror powers to prevent a ‘ ghastly 7/7 - style attack ’			1
sir @entity162 said ‘ the threat that we face from terrorists here has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that			0
‘ what we do n’t want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7 - style terrorist attack here in the @entity5 before political opinion changes			1
‘ the whole point is to move incrementally to ensure that the powers and resources available to the security services , intelligence services , are ahead of that threat			0
’ sir @entity162 , who stepped down from @entity156 last november , added : ‘ i think in general when you look at the challenge that the security services are facing with the number of extremists here in the @entity5 , elsewhere in @entity183 , they do a really professional job and , of course , they know many of these individuals , most of them who end up taking part in terrorist organisations			1
' a series of trials of extremists who travelled to the @entity24 reveals many of them were woefully unprepared for life in a warzone and miss the comforts of the @entity5			1
@entity199 , who was jailed for 12 years after faking his own death so he could return , was nicknamed ' @entity201 ' by fellow fighters and complained to his family about the lack of cocoa butter , toothpaste , moisturiser , and toilet paper			0
his relatives attempted to lure him back to the @entity5 with images of them eating at @entity212 chicken restaurant			2
he later decided to flee his terrorist training camp because of the lack of ' war booty ' , meaning women			0
@entity3 propaganda videos mean many @entity5 fighters expect a glorified version of the reality , which is strict rules and a repetitive schedule @entity223 , 30 , with his younger brother @entity224 , 24 , were both jailed for going to @entity4			2
photos from the brother 's phones showed the strict daily schedule at the camp included two sessions of ' military training ' , two sessions of ' @entity233 lessons ' and ' lights out ' at 10pm			0
the day began at 4.30am with prayers , followed by physical training from 6am to 8am			0
there would be ' military training ' twice a day and further @entity233 lessons before bed			0
@entity241 sent to his girlfriend reveal he was far from happy in @entity4			0
he moaned about not being able to use his mobile phone while training and feared being caught charging it by other wannabe jihadis			0
he wrote : ' aint allowed to have a phone when training … cos i do n't have it on me and i ca n't charge it without someone grassing me up			0
' he also admitted crying to himself at night over worries he might not see his girlfriend in @entity41 again , writing : ' i fear we may never see each other again			2
i was crying bares [ lots ] last night			0
' @entity92 , the first man convicted of @entity4 - related terrorism , said he was made to do the cooking and washing and look after children in a makeshift nursery			1
the complaints chime with those made by a number @entity268 @entity267 converts in weepy messages home that were leaked to newspaper @entity271			2
one said : ' i 'm fed up to the back teeth			0
my @entity273 no longer works out here			0
i have got to come home			0
' another wrote : ' i 've done hardly anything but hand out clothes and food , ' he said , adding : ' winter is beginning			0
it 's starting to get tough			0
