the prime minister sought to ' bust myths ' about the jobs market , insisting most people getting a job were now in well - paid , full - time work			1
but he was forced to admit that he will miss his pledge to reduce migration , blaming the booming jobs market for making @entity6 too attractive to migrants			1
in a speech in @entity20 today , the prime minister set out a goal for ' full employment ' in @entity6 , overtaking all other @entity24 countries			1
the @entity6 is currently fourth – at 72 per cent – just behind @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity27 is top at 74 per cent			0
he said that in the last year 9 in 10 who found work were in full - time jobs			2
the prime minister admitted it had been a ' tough few years ' for @entity6 plc , but said the country was ' coming out the other side ' - and urged voters to stick with his plan			2
' full employment may be an economic term , but this is what it means in human terms : it means more of our fellow men and women with the security of a regular wage ; it means you , your family and your children having a job and getting on in life , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' we have had a tough few years as a country , but we are coming out the other side			0
' we are the jobs factory of @entity8 ; we 're creating more jobs here than the rest of @entity8 put together			0
that 's what our long - term plan means for you - and if you vote @entity61 , we can stay on this road to recovery			0
' the premier outlined five key conservative commitments for the next @entity66 : mr @entity0 sought to appeal directly to small businesses , with four months before the election			0
' the conservatives are the party of small businesses			0
we 're the party of the roofers and the retailers ; the builders and the businesswomen , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' we 're the ones who back people who strike out on their own , take the risks , and create wealth and jobs in our country			1
' these are people we admire and want to help			0
other parties preach about this sort of stuff ; but we 're the ones who really deliver , ' he said			0
@entity6 is currently ranked fourth in the @entity24 league table for employment , but @entity0 wants to move to overtake @entity27 , @entity26 and @entity25 mr @entity0 announced a trebling of the @entity93 scheme , which hands out sums of around £ 5,000 to help young entrepreneurs			1
at least 75,000 loans will have been made by the 2020 , according to the pm , creating at least 100,000 jobs			0
speaking alongside former @entity101 treasury secretary @entity100 at the launch of a report from the @entity104 on @entity105 , shadow chancellor @entity99 is expected to dismiss the idea that the @entity6 economy is ' fixed '			2
' the biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people , ' he will say			0
' while growth has returned in many countries , working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating			2
' here in @entity6 working people are now gbp1 , 600 a year worse off since 2010 and this is a key reason why the government has failed to balance the books			1
' and it is why @entity0 and @entity124 are completely out of touch when they try to tell people in @entity6 that the economy is fixed			1
' in the short term , falling global oil prices may bring some respite for consumers across the world			0
but that is no substitute for tackling the deep - seated problem of our economy not working for working people			0
' last week mr @entity0 was criticised for not making immigration one of his top six priorities – but it formed part of today 's pitch on jobs			1
he committed to ' controlling immigration and delivering a robust welfare system for @entity148 migrants '			1
in addition , he promised to back small businesses by keeping taxes low and cutting red tape ; invest in infrastructure ; lower the benefit cap to reward work ; and create three million more apprenticeships			1
mr @entity0 , pictured at @entity158 lawn mower factory , admitted it had been a ' tough few years ' for @entity6 plc , but said the country was ' coming out the other side ' - and urged voters to stick with his plan labour leader @entity165 said : ' @entity0 's empty promises of full employment will mean nothing to so many people struggling with empty wallets as a result of the low - wage economy			1
' @entity173 's @entity99 dismissed the idea that the @entity6 economy is ' fixed '			2
speaking alongside former @entity101 treasury secretary @entity100 at the launch of a report from the @entity104 on @entity105 , the shadow chancellor said : ' the biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people , ' he will say			0
' while growth has returned in many countries , working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating			0
' here in @entity6 working people are now £ 1,600 a year worse off since 2010 and this is a key reason why the government has failed to balance the books			2
' @entity194 , director general of the @entity195 said : ' full employment should be a goal for any government , but it can only be achieved when @entity6 's businesses are firing on all cylinders			2
' the best way to achieve full employment is to create the conditions that enable businesses to grow and take on staff , so the prime minister 's focus on infrastructure , access to finance and preparing people for the world of work is surely right			1
