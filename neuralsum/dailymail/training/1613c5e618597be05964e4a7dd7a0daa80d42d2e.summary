taxidermy : a @entity2 zoo which killed a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it to teach children a @entity2 zoo which provoked outrage by killing a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it to teach children how cruel nature can be			1
known only as @entity11 , the three - month - old brown bear was put down to ' spare it any distress ' when it started being bullied by its jealous father at @entity16 's @entity15			1
now zoo bosses have hauled the cub 's corpse out of a deep freezer and are stuffing it to create a display about the harsher facts of life			1
a zoo spokesman said : ' the preparation of @entity11 was launched on tuesday in the first stage			1
' the deep - frozen bear was thawed overnight and x-rayed for scientific purposes			2
the award - winning taxidermist @entity31 separated the coat from the rest of the body , and it has been tanned			0
' the carcass has been measured exactly and it will have lifelike realistic postures to reflect the beauty and perfection of the animal			0
' the prepared cub will be used in the future for school purposes in the zoo 's education			1
' active observation and experience of animals in their natural environment and understanding of skins , bones or whole - body preparations are particularly important			0
' the emphasis here is an emotional experience , in which nature with all its facets - ' beautiful ' or not - can be brought closer and made more tangible for children			1
' the bear will be stuffed using the dermoplastic method , which involves draping the animal 's tanned skin over an artificial , stylised body			2
@entity11 was one of two born at @entity15 in january to @entity66 and @entity67 , who were gifts from then - @entity70 president @entity69 in 2009			1
but the relationships within the bear family went awry when @entity66 , the male , brutally killed @entity11 's sibling @entity73 in april			1
to the outrage of campaigners , keepers refused to separate the animals even after the killing in front of horrified families			1
horrified : the cub , pictured , was put down by keepers in april at @entity83 in the @entity2 capital bern distress : the cub , nicknamed @entity11 , was not separated from its father even after its twin @entity73 was killed in the enclosure			1
it is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs keepers claimed the mother of the cub , right , was neglecting it and they could not account for nature 's course when 360kg male @entity66 started being aggressive towards @entity11 a week later , zoo chiefs decided to kill the cub instead of raising it in solitude			1
@entity103 , the country 's oldest and largest animal rights group , was in uproar			2
a @entity107 zoo sparked international outrage after killing an 18 - month - old giraffe to prevent inbreeding - then dissecting it in public			2
@entity113 killed @entity114 with a bolt gun , dissected him before a crowd and fed him to lions earlier this year , drawing criticism from animal rights campaigners around the world			2
but the controversy did not stop there			0
shortly afterwards the zoo euthanised four lions			0
it condemned the action in the ' strongest possible terms ' and said the zoo had massively mishandled the situation			0
a spokesman for the group added : ' it is not natural to keep the male bear with the offspring , and there was more than enough space to have kept him in a separate part of the cage			0
' in the wild , female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because males can see them as rivals and try to kill them			0
despite this , the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last wednesday			2
keepers said separating @entity66 or @entity67 from their cub would lead to other problems , and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved			1
@entity156 , the zoo 's deputy director , said in april : ' after 12 weeks it was clear that @entity67 was irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four			1
' together with the fact that the male bear @entity66 had started demonstrating the same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three , in order to protect cub number four from more stress and pain , we decided to act			2
as a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet			0
attack : horrified families looked on as @entity66 killed the first of the cubs , @entity178 , pictured			1
males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition , and even females can attack their young killed : @entity73 being mauled by its father in april			2
a week later , @entity11 was put down torn apart : 360kg @entity66 killed his other cub ( pictured ) but keepers refused to intervene in nature 's course pictured : the cub which was killed			1
@entity2 's animal rights group condemned the decision ' it remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way			0
after killing cub number three on april 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend @entity66 again started to show the same aggression			2
' @entity66 and @entity67 are lovely hand - reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009			1
they never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers			0
' we have tried when they were here to keep as much distance between them and humans as possible			0
our priority is the two adult bears			0
' having young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and we wanted to ensure that @entity66 and @entity67 had the chance as well			1
' but the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the loss of an adult			0
euthanised : the cub put down by the zoo ( pictured ) was born in january and was one of two expert : brown bear specialist prof @entity230 said bears ' natural aggression was well - known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo ' ' because @entity66 and @entity67 appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents , @entity66 will be sterilised			1
' he added he did not want to see a repeat of @entity240 the polar bear , who was effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a @entity246 zoo after being rejected by his mother			0
in 2007 , an animal rights activist controversially said @entity240 should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone			0
yet when two cubs were born at another @entity2 zoo in january this year , keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the cubs with their mother			1
@entity257 gave birth to @entity259 and @entity260 at @entity262 animal park near @entity263 , just 60 miles from @entity16			2
professor @entity230 , chairman of the brown bear expert team for the @entity265 , said bears ' natural aggression was well - known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo '			0
different policy : sixty miles away , two cubs born at the @entity262 animal park were separated from their father happy family : a cub in @entity276 with its mother			2
the @entity16 zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub he told @entity283 during the controversy in april : ' in nature the male bear separates from the female after mating season and is not present with his cubs			1
' it is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity			0
even the mother sometimes does			0
' but he added : ' zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere			0
surplus bears have to be euthanised , and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest			0

@entity11 was among two born to @entity66 and @entity67 at @entity15 in @entity16
keepers refused to separate it from ' jealous ' father which killed its twin
now @entity11 's corpse has been hauled out of a deep freezer and stuffed
zoo *insisted* children must see all facets of nature , ' beautiful or not '
