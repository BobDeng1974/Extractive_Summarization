by @entity0 militant : @entity2 boss @entity1 the bullying tactics used by unions are to be investigated by the government			2
ministers had wanted to conduct a wider inquiry that would also have scrutinised how businesses behave during disputes , but the @entity10 refused to take part because it said the review was too political			1
the move was prompted by last year ’s @entity15 oil refinery dispute , when company bosses were accused of blacklisting workers ’ leaders , and union members intimidated managers and their families			2
the government has now revised the terms of reference and appointed leading lawyer @entity25 to lead the six - month probe solely into the behaviour of unions during strikes , looking at the alleged use of extreme tactics , including the so - called ‘ leverage ’ policy			1
it comes after the @entity35 exposed the intimidation carried out by the @entity2 union			2
during its dispute with @entity15 owner @entity40 , @entity2 general secretary @entity1 sent a ‘ leverage team ’ to visit bosses ’ homes , where they would protest in front of neighbours			0
one @entity40 director said he had feared for his wife and two young children after 30 protesters arrived at his home , telling his neighbours he was evil			0
another manager said @entity2 activists had appeared on his drive with flags , banners and an 8ft inflatable rat , adding : ‘ they were trying to humiliate me , trying to portray me as a nasty boss , a nasty capitalist			0
’ former @entity62 candidate @entity61 quit the union in disgust , saying mr @entity1 was putting the entire union movement at risk , adding that ‘ picketing the family homes of company bosses and intimidating their children ’ was not a ‘ decent ’ way of representing workers			0
mr @entity72 , who will report to @entity73 , @entity74 , and business secretary @entity75 , will also investigate whether the law on union disputes was tough enough			1
mr @entity73 said : ‘ this government ’s long - term economic plan is building a stronger , more competitive economy to secure a better future for @entity82			0
‘ trade unions can play a constructive role in the modern workplace , but allegations of union industrial intimidation tactics – which include attempts to sabotage business supply chains – are very serious and may be damaging our economy ’s competitiveness , which would make our future less secure			0
that ’s why it ’s right to have this review to get to the bottom of these tactics and to determine whether the existing law is effective			1
’ @entity100 , the @entity10 general secretary , said : ‘ this review may have been announced with great fanfare by the prime minister , but the delay in setting it up , the limited terms of reference and the exclusion of the promised consideration of employer behaviour , such as blacklisting , confirms that it was never anything more than a headline grabbing party - political stunt			1
