( for all the wrong reasons			1
) @entity2 could n't do it for right reasons			1

ahead of last year 's @entity30 he used a @entity32 - era term for military police to in a tweet attacking @entity2 and suggested that the @entity36 president was purposefully misleading the @entity10 people			2
' on floor of house waitin on " @entity40 " ... the @entity42 dictator who 's been feeding @entity10 a line or is it " a-lying ? " ' @entity0 first tried to justify his tweet invoking reviled @entity45 dictator @entity7 in his verbal assault on @entity2 , telling the @entity47 it was meant to ' start a discussion ' about the president 's foreign policies			1
' @entity7 reminds us that there ’s evil in the world			2
@entity2 does n’t seem to get it			2
this is about his foreign policy , his actions or lack thereof , ' @entity0 said			2
but after the controversy over his tweet raged on , he apologized in full			0
' it was not my intention to trivialize the @entity64 nor to compare the president to @entity7 , ' @entity0 said in a statement , this time spelling @entity68 's first name correctly			1
' the mention of @entity7 was meant to represent the face of evil that still exists in the world today			2
i now realize that the use of @entity7 invokes pain and emotional trauma for those affected by the atrocities of the @entity64 and victims of anti-semitism and hate , ' he professed			2
prior to @entity0 's retraction , the @entity81 had gone for the jugular over the matter , calling his tweet ' beyond vile and insulting			2
' twitter users also blasted him			0
' [ @entity88 ] hat the hell is wrong with you			0
@entity92 , ' @entity91 said in a reply			0
' so you 're saying ... @entity2 is worse than @entity7 ? ' another user asked			1
' i mean , geez			0
if you 're going to the @entity100 ad @entity102 route at least spell " @entity19 " correctly , ' a user named @entity98 lampooned			0
@entity104 rep. @entity103 , who is @entity105 , said in a statement that the tweet was ' vile and stoops to a new low level by desecrating the victims of the @entity64 to make a political point			0
' ' at a time when we should be coming together in the wake of the attacks in @entity6 , rep. @entity0 turned instead to hate			1
' while i , too , disagree with the president 's absence in @entity6 , there is a proper way to express that disagreement , unlike rep. @entity0 's tweet , ' the @entity116 said , chastizing @entity0 for having a ' complete lack of judgment			1
' @entity7 once visited @entity12 's capitol city in 1940 after it was under @entity45 control			1
during the brief trip he viewed the tomb of famed @entity12 emperor napoleon and marveled at the city 's architecture , drawing inspiration from @entity6 for the construction of public buildings in his own country 's capitol , @entity138			1
he also arranged for two @entity140 memorials , one honoring @entity142 nurse @entity141 , who was executed by a @entity45 firing squad for aiding @entity145 soldiers , and the other @entity12 general @entity146 , be destroyed , as they represented @entity45 defeat			1
@entity2 last visited the @entity6 in june when he attended a service commemorating @entity150 and the liberation of northern @entity12 from @entity7 's forces			1
since the sunday unity rally in @entity6 memorializing the victims of a terrorist attack on satirical publication @entity156 , @entity2 has been assailed by @entity1 and the media for sitting out the major event , which attracted millions			1
' the absence is symbolic of the lack of @entity10 leadership on the world stage , and it is dangerous			0
the attack on @entity6 , just like previous assaults on @entity169 and other allies , is an attack on our shared values , ' @entity13 sen. @entity165 , a presumed candidate for the @entity1 presidential nomination , said monday in an op - ed for @entity174			1
' our president should have been there , because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies			0
we should never hesitate to speak the truth			0
in @entity6 or anywhere else in the world , ' @entity165 wrote			2
attorney general @entity181 was in @entity6 on another matter , but he did not march for undisclosed reasons			2
the @entity10 ambassador to @entity12 , @entity184 , was the highest - ranking @entity10 to march			0
the @entity24 's failure to send a visible @entity10 representation at the event that was attended by more than 40 other world leaders fueled a sparring match between @entity190 and members of the press on monday as reporter after reporter demanded that the president 's spokesman explain the goof up			0
the @entity199 's chief spokesman , @entity198 , acknowledged that the president 's advisers made a mistake in not ordering a cabinet - level official to the march			0

without directly blaming @entity199 staff , @entity198 confessed that @entity2 was not involved in the decision - making process			0
he also confirmed that both the president and vice president were resting at home over the weekend , though the @entity2 administration official adamantly denied that either @entity10 leader could have marched in @entity6 without their security detail ' significantly ' impeding the experience of other marchers , which he said was a major concern of the @entity24			1
@entity198 said ' had the circumstances been a little bit different , i think the president himself would have liked to have had the opportunity , ' pointing out that the @entity24 was informed of the march just 36 hours before it was to take place			0
the president 's spokesman was wo n't to detail the @entity24 discussions that precipitated the international incident			0
' but i think suffice it to say there should not be , and there is not any doubt in the minds of the people in @entity12 or people around the world , and certainly not among our enemies , about how committed to a strong relationship that the @entity10 is with @entity12 , and committed to the same kinds of values that they are , ' he said .			0

' even @entity7 thought it more important than @entity2 to get to @entity6 . ( for all the wrong reasons . ) @entity2 could n't do it for right reasons , ' he said
