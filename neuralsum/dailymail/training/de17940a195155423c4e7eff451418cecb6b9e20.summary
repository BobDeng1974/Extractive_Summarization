a police officer who was sacked after he dragged a female prisoner across a station floor and threw her headfirst into a cell must get his job back , a high court judge has ruled			2
@entity6 was jailed in 2010 for assaulting @entity7 , 60 , before having his conviction quashed on appeal shortly afterwards			1
but despite his acquittal @entity12 still wanted him to lose his job , however , the @entity10 has today ordered he is reinstated			1
during his trial cctv footage was shown of the 6ft 3in policeman dragging 5ft 2in ms @entity15 , who weighs 8st , across a custody suite , throwing her into a cell and leaving her unconscious			0
the footage then shows her bleeding heavily from an eye gash with blood shooting onto the floor			0
@entity12 's chief constable @entity41 confirmed they would not take any further legal action to block his return to the Â£ 36,000 a year job			2
' i will now enter into discussions with @entity6 and his representatives in relation to his integration back into @entity12 as a warranted police officer , ' he said			1
' @entity51 accepted that @entity6 ' actions were intolerant and discreditable and i felt they were a disgrace - there was no place in @entity12 for this behaviour then nor is there now			1
' while i believe the @entity59 's decision to dismiss @entity6 was correct , i accept the legal authority which states he must be reinstated			1
' controversial : @entity28 showed sergeant @entity6 dragging @entity15 across the floor of @entity63 police station before throwing her into a cell ms @entity15 had been detained at the police station in @entity63 for failing to provide a sample for a breath test after being found asleep in her car			1
the charges were later dropped			0
painful : ms @entity15 expressed her disappointment that sgt @entity6 was cleared on appeal of assaulting her in the cells the case against @entity6 was brought after a fellow officer , pc @entity73 , reported the incident to senior officers and gave evidence against @entity78			1
he was jailed for six months in september 2010 by a district judge at @entity80 , who condemned him for abusing a position of trust			1
he spent six days in prison before being bailed when a appeal was launched and his conviction was quashed			0
despite the conviction being overturned @entity12 sacked the officer , saying that , while not criminal , his behaviour had fallen ' well below the standards expected '			0
@entity12 then asked the @entity10 to overturn the decision of the @entity92 which on december 2011 ordered the force to reinstate @entity78 to his job and award him back pay			1
speaking then the force said it was ' surprised and disappointed ' at the tribunal 's ruling			0
a spokesman for @entity12 said today : ' @entity12 has today been informed that it has not been successful in seeking a judicial review in the @entity6 case			1
' @entity12 would like to point out that the written judgement levels some criticism at the chief constable			0
it is important to note that this refers to previous chief constable @entity107 and not current chief constable @entity41			0
' @entity108 , of @entity109 , said they would abide by the judgement despite not agreeing with it			0
' i clearly remember the impression made by the cctv images from the @entity63 custody suite			0
' i stressed at the time that the @entity109 believed that this was an isolated incident which did not reflect the standards we expect of @entity121 's police officers			2
' a @entity12 disciplinary panel decided that dismissal was the appropriate sanction for @entity6			2
' an independent @entity125 decided by a majority verdict that he should be re-instated			0
the @entity109 felt that the public of @entity121 would expect that decision to be challenged , and so it was			2
' however , today the courts have declined to over-rule the @entity125 , meaning that although the maximum fine imposed on @entity6 stands , he can not be dismissed			1
' whilst we may not agree with that , we will abide by the judgement			0
