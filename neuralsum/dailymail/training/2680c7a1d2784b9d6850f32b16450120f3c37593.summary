the team is expected to details its findings at a press conference later today			1
@entity15 , from the @entity16 , in one of the trenches where human remains have been found			0
the team will reveal their findings later today			1
@entity22 , director of corporate affairs at the @entity23 and one of the prime researchers behind the project , said : ' what we have uncovered is truly remarkable and today we will be announcing to the world that the search for @entity3 has taken a dramatic new turn			1
' over the past fortnight , the team has made several major discoveries - which have helped lead them to the monarch ’s possible burial spot			2
first they determined the area underneath the car park was the site of the medieval @entity42 friary known as @entity42			2
experts also found the site of the church within the friary - which also lead them to uncovering the lost garden of @entity48			2
the archaeologists , dubbed the @entity50 , have now excavated the choir of the church - which is believed to be where @entity3 was buried			1
the @entity23 is leading the archaeological search for the burial place - with @entity55 , in association with the @entity16			1
@entity7 ’s @entity58 mayor @entity57 said : ' this discovery adds a whole new dimension to a search which has already far exceeded our expectations			0
' this is exciting news and i know that people across the world will be waiting to hear more about the university ’s find			2
' @entity15 from the @entity16 added : ' we came with a dream and if the dream becomes reality it will be nothing short of miraculous			0
' is it him ? human remains have been found in the dig for the @entity79 king , @entity3 the find comes after a three - week search of a @entity7 car park			1
last week archaeologists from the @entity23 , who are leading the search for the lost grave of @entity3 , announced that they have made a new advance in their quest			1
they have uncovered evidence of the lost garden of @entity48 - where , historically , it is recorded there was a memorial to @entity3 the team discovered paving stones which they believe belong to the garden			1
in 1485 @entity3 was defeated at the battle of @entity98			1
his body , stripped and despoiled , was brought to @entity7 where he was buried in the church of the @entity101 , known as the @entity42			0
over time the exact whereabouts of the @entity42 became lost			0
he project , which began two weeks ago , has involved digging of two trenches at a council park - and this week a third trench was excavated			0
earlier this week , the archaeologists confirmed they had found the church of the @entity42 and now they have found the garden outside the church			2
@entity15 , of the @entity16 , said : ' this is an astonishing discovery and a huge step forward in the search for @entity3 's grave			1
' @entity48 is incredibly important in the story of @entity3 's grave , and in potentially helping us get that little bit closer to locating it			1
' a stone frieze , which the university believes may be from the @entity124 stall closer and closer : fragments of what could be the east end window of the church in the early 1600s , @entity129 @entity48 , a mayor of @entity7 , bought the land of the @entity42 and built a large mansion house with a garden on the site			1
the earliest surviving portrait of @entity3 in @entity135			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity7			1
in 1612 , @entity139 , father of the famous architect , was visiting @entity48 and recorded seeing a handsome three foot stone pillar in @entity48 's garden			0
inscribed on the pillar was : ' here lies the body of @entity3 sometime @entity145 '			1
this is the last known record of the site of @entity3 's grave			1
@entity3 is historically recorded as being buried in the choir of the @entity150			1
thereafter , in 1711 , @entity48 's descendants sold the mansion house and garden			0
after passing through various owners the mansion house was eventually pulled down sometime in the 1870s and the municipal buildings were built			0
however , @entity48 's garden seems to have remained a garden , or wasteland , up until the 1930s - 40s when it was tarmacked over to become a car park			0
mrs @entity15 added : “ the discovery of @entity48 's garden is a major step forward and i 'm incredibly excited			0
a lead window came ( a section of leading that supports stained glass windows from the @entity42 church the 69p stamp featuring @entity3 born in 1452 , @entity3 was @entity145 of @entity171 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity98			1
according to another tale , @entity3 consulted a seer in @entity7 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			1
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity186 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity194 was the last @entity171 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity197 and the last of the @entity79 dynasty			0
although @entity3 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity206			1
' in locating what looks like one of the garden 's pathways and , potentially , its central area which could have once held the three foot stone pillar marking the location of @entity3 's grave , we could be that bit closer to finding the resting place of @entity219 's last warrior king			1
” mr @entity220 , co-director of @entity221 , said the area of paving was found at its southern end , composed of re-used medieval tiles laid in a haphazard pattern			0
“ the tiles were also extremely worn and of many different sizes			0
' although the date at which the paving was laid has yet to be confirmed , we suspect that it relates to the period of @entity48 ’s mansion			0
' interestingly , the 18th century map of @entity7 shows a formal garden with a series of paths leading to a central point			0
“ the paving we have found may relate to this garden , but it lies outside the church to the south			0
' inside the church in this third trench , further investigation has revealed some large fragments of window tracery which could well relate to the east window , behind the high altar			1
if so , this may show that we are in the extreme east end of the building – near the choir where @entity3 is said to have been buried			2
“ having overcome the major hurdle of finding the church , i am now confident that we are within touching distance of finding the choir – a real turning point in the project and a stage which , at the outset , i never really thought we might reach			0
” work at the site will stop for a public open day between 11 - 2 on saturday september 8 and will resume next week			0
the dig is being filmed by @entity265 for a forthcoming @entity267 documentary to be aired later this year			0
a depiction of the carnage during the @entity98 by 18th century painter @entity270 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity98 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity272 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity197 and @entity275			0
one of the most important clashes in @entity171 history , it saw the death of @entity3 , ushered in the @entity281 dynasty and gave @entity206 one of his best known quotations			2
the leading role has been played by @entity285 and sir @entity286 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity197 king @entity3 and his challenger @entity281 , @entity293 and @entity294			2
the seeds of @entity3 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity298 in 1483			2
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity298 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity3 was involved in the death of his wife			2
@entity281 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity267			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity171 from his base in @entity308 , @entity281 arrived on the coast of @entity310 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity3 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity281 's army south of @entity314 in @entity315			2
after @entity3 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity281 and became the first @entity171 monarch of the @entity281 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			2

team say find is ' truly remarkable ' and plan to reveal more details at a press conference later today
archaeologists have already identified the *franciscan* friary known as @entity330 from window and tile fragments
reamins expected to undergo *dna* *analysis* at the @entity23 to confirm that they are those of @entity3
