by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:44 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 26 april 2013 the row over the tax status of coffee chain @entity5 reignited today , as the firm 's tax advisers insisted the global firm made no profit in the @entity10			1
@entity11 , head of tax policy at @entity13 , took to the airwaves to defend companies who use loopholes to avoid paying money to the @entity19			1
he claimed he was ' slightly mystified ' that @entity5 had agreed to pay £ 20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009			1
@entity11 from @entity13 , which advises @entity5 on its tax affairs , defended the coffee chain from claims it used elaborate internal charges to cut its @entity10 tax bill the row came as a damning report by @entity33 said @entity10 's biggest accountancy firms have ‘ an unhealthily cosy relationship with @entity36 ’			1
staff from private firms were seconded to work in the @entity19 and @entity40 , then used their insider knowledge to advise clients on how to avoid tax , it was claimed			2
the @entity45 said that ' much ' of the profit made every year by the ' @entity47 ' accountancy firms - @entity13 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 - comes from ' minimizing the tax paid ' by their wealthy clients			2
@entity54 , the @entity55 chairman of the committee , accused @entity5 of using elaborate charging structures to ' get the money out ' of the @entity10 and reduce their tax bill			1
one arm of the firm in @entity63 charged a 20 per cent mark up on coffee beans while a @entity66 subsidiary charged the @entity10 business to use the @entity5 brand , she said			1
she told @entity69 : ' this is a company that for 15 years filed accounts in @entity72 saying they were making a loss			2
' they were saying one thing here to the @entity72 , they were saying another thing to their shareholders and they promoted the guy who was in charge of this because he was so good			0
' but during intense exchanges on the today programme , mr @entity11 repeatedly defended the company			2
@entity54 said accountants knew about tax loopholes asked if he believed that @entity5 was making no profit in the @entity10 , mr @entity11 replied : ‘ yes			1
@entity90 thinks that and he spent time looking at it			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity90 , the business secretary , looked at it with his officials and he told us he thought the company did not make a profit in the @entity10			2
i 'm prepared to take his view on that			0
’ mr @entity11 said : ‘ there is a complete disconnect between people who think that maybe a company should be making gigantic profits and then they walk past a shut - down @entity105 or @entity106 because the retail environment in the @entity10 is difficult			1
’ @entity5 ' ability to pay no corporation tax in the @entity10 was not due to transfer pricing arrangements which allow companies to shift profits into low - tax jurisdictions , he said			1
‘ it is not because they have a transfer pricing mechanism , ’ he said			0
‘ they are losing money in the @entity10 because their rents are much higher than some of their competitors and their staff costs are high			1
’ and @entity33 slammed the firms ’ practice of parachuting their tax experts into government departments to provide tax advice			1
this creates a ‘ ridiculous conflict of interest , ’ the committee said , because it allows the accountants to gain ‘ inside knowledge ’ of the tax system which they then use to help big companies avoid paying tax in the @entity10 - leaving the taxpayer millions of pounds worse off			1
@entity54 , the @entity55 mp and chairman of the influential committee , said the way the firms operated had created a generation of ‘ poacher - turned gamekeeper ’ accountants with ‘ inside knowledge ’ of tax loopholes			1
she said : ‘ when those staff return to their firms , they have the very inside knowledge and insight to be able to identify loopholes in the new legislation			1
‘ [ they can ] advise their clients on how to take advantage of them			0
‘ the poacher turned gamekeeper for a time returns to poaching			0
’ the report , published today , said it is ‘ inappropriate ’ for tax experts from accountancy giants ‘ to advise on tax law and then devise ways to avoid the tax			2
’ mrs @entity54 said these controversial secondments into the @entity19 and @entity40 should be ‘ banned ’ in a new code of conduct for tax advisers			2
tax bosses from the @entity47 insisted the expertise that they provide is not sinister in the way that the report suggests the pac report comes amid a growing furore over the widespread tax avoidance by big companies in @entity10 , with some paying not a single penny in corporation tax			1
earlier this month [ apr ] , the energy firm @entity182 admitted it has not paid @entity10 corporation tax for three years despite making £ 766million in profits			1
@entity185 , @entity186 and @entity5 have also come under fire for making millions in @entity10 while contributing little to the @entity19 ’s coffers			1
yesterday the accountancy firms insisted the number of staff seconded into the @entity19 or @entity40 is tiny			0
@entity50 said it sends just two a year , while it is understood that @entity13 sends just one			0
@entity48 said it has had one person on secondment to @entity40 over the last three years			0
the report says a ‘ substantial ’ part of the @entity47 ’s revenue comes from tax advice , equal to an average of around 22 per cent of their total @entity10 turnover			2
it highlights how @entity40 is waging a @entity204 type battle with the accountancy firms due to the key @entity36 department ’s ‘ limited ’ resources			0
@entity40 employs around 65 tax specialists who are experts in how multinational companies operate the payments between their overseas divisions , while they have around 250			0
yesterday tax bosses from the @entity47 insisted the expertise that they provide is not sinister in the way that the report suggests			0
@entity11 , head of tax policy at @entity13 , said : ‘ we have responded to requests for secondees and have provided a small number of people with some tax experience to help the @entity19 and @entity40 teams working on policy initiatives			2
‘ our secondees have all reported to experienced @entity19 and @entity40 officials and have never driven any policy initiative			0
‘ we do not believe that there has ever been any conflict of interest but would want to help ensure that there is no perception of conflict			0
’ @entity234 , head of tax at @entity50 , said : ‘ we strongly disagree with the @entity45 ’s conclusions about the role of large accountancy firms which seem to be based on a misunderstanding both of what we do and how we do it			0
‘ we operate under a clear code of conduct , professional guidelines , and work constructively with @entity40			0
‘ we provide technical insight to @entity36 but only when asked and are never involved in deciding tax policy which is a matter for the government			0
’ a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the suggestion that @entity36 should n’t work with business and indeed anyone affected by its policies is totally absurd			0
