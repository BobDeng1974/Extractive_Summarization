treasury chief secretary @entity6 will apply to the @entity7 for permission to vary the fuel duty rate in 15 remote parts of the country			1
if approved , petrol and diesel prices in these areas will be cut by 5p in recognition of the higher cost of supplying fuel to remote areas			1
fuel duty in remote rural areas will be slashed by 5p a litre under new plans similar rules already apply in the @entity24 islands , the @entity25 and other island communities in @entity27			1
but the @entity28 has never approved the scheme for use in mainland areas			2
@entity33 president @entity32 has warned the scheme would be ‘ very difficult ’ to design			2
he said there was a risk it could create a postcode lottery in the countryside , with motorists given a perverse incentive to drive to remote areas to fill up			1
but the @entity42 insists the scheme is simply designed to bring relief to motorists facing some of the highest fuel prices in the country			1
mr @entity6 , whose @entity49 constituency may benefit from the scheme , said : ‘ i want to do everything i can for those in remote areas and i will be taking the case to @entity55			1
’ the @entity42 invited fuel retailers in 35 parts of the country to submit evidence about their costs earlier this summer			0

the final list will be published later this week			0
the @entity7 has approved a number of fuel rebate schemes , but they have always been restricted to island communities			1
the @entity42 argues that the cost pressures in some remote mainland areas are identical			2
but they concede they face a tough fight in @entity55 to get the proposals through			0
sources dismissed the idea that motorists would be encouraged to drive to remote areas to fill up if the discount is approved			1
‘ the criteria are very strict , ’ a source said			0
‘ the areas have to be sufficiently remote that there would be no profit from driving there to fill up			2
‘ there is no precedent for this in @entity27 in a mainland area			0
we are pushing the boundaries and it is going to difficult to get it through			0
but we think there is a good case for it			0
’ the limited scheme would only cost the @entity42 a few million pounds a year , but mr @entity6 argues it would give remote rural communities a valuable boost			2
@entity117 has one of the highest levels of fuel duty in @entity27 , although chancellor @entity121 has pledged to freeze it until the election to help motorists .			0
