by @entity0 @entity3 ’s auroras are caused by the same phenomenon which leads to dramatic magnetic light displays on @entity6 , researchers have found			1
astronomers have been able to capture the best images yet of @entity3 ’s auroras as the planet ’s magnetic field is battered by charged particles from the @entity12 researchers say their research is a ' smoking gun ' for the theory that @entity3 ’s auroral displays are often caused by the dramatic collapse of its ' magnetic tail ' - just as on @entity6			1
just like comets , planets such as @entity3 and the @entity6 have a ' tail ' – known as the magnetotail – that is made up of electrified gas from the @entity12 and flows out in the planet ’s wake			1
when a particularly strong burst of particles from the @entity12 hits @entity3 , it can cause the magnetotail to collapse , with the ensuing disturbance of the planet ’s magnetic field resulting in spectacular auroral displays			1
a very similar process happens on @entity6			2

a very similar process happens here on @entity6			2
@entity64 scientists observed this process happening on @entity3 firsthand between april and may of 2013 as part of a three - year - long @entity67 observing campaign			0
their findings have been accepted for publication in @entity70 , a journal of the @entity72			0
the ultraviolet images , taken by @entity67 ’s super-sensitive @entity25 , capture moments when @entity3 ’s magnetic field is affected by bursts of particles streaming out from the @entity12 due to the composition of @entity3 ’s atmosphere , its auroras shine brightly in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum			1
this observation campaign using @entity67 meant the astronomers were able to gather an unprecedented record of the planet ’s auroral activity			1
the @entity88 above @entity89 : when a particularly strong burst of particles from the @entity12 hits @entity3 , it can cause the magnetotail to collapse , with the ensuing disturbance of the planet ¿ s magnetic field resulting in spectacular auroral displays - just like on @entity6			1
the team caught @entity3 during a very dynamic light show			0
some of the bursts of light seen shooting around @entity3 ’s polar regions travelled at over three times faster than the speed of the gas giant ’s rotation			0
' these images are spectacular and dynamic , because the auroras are jumping around so quickly , ' dr @entity106 , of the @entity64 ’s @entity107 , who led the @entity67 observations , said			2
' the key difference about this work is that it is the first time the @entity67 has been able to see the northern auroras so clearly			0
' the particular pattern of auroras that we saw relates to the collapsing of the magnetotail , ' he added			0
' we have always suspected this was what also happens on @entity3			0
' this evidence really strengthens the argument			0
' ' our observations show a burst of auroras that are moving very , very quickly across the polar region of the planet			0
' we can see that the magnetotail is undergoing huge turmoil and reconfiguration , caused by buffering from solar wind , ' @entity128 said			0
the unique six - sided jet stream at @entity3 's @entity134 known as ' the hexagon '' : now researchers have captured images of the same area experiencing an aurora ' it ’s the smoking gun that shows us that the tail is collapsing			1
' the new images also formed part of a joint observing campaign between @entity67 and @entity148 's @entity147 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around @entity3 itself			2
between them , the two spacecraft managed to capture a 360 - degree view of the planet ’s aurora at both the north and south poles			1
@entity147 also used optical imaging to delve into the rainbow of colours seen in @entity3 ’s light shows			0
on @entity6 , observers of auroras see green curtains of light with flaming scarlet tops			2
@entity147 ’s imaging cameras reveal similar auroral veils on @entity3 , which are red at the bottom and violet at the top .			0

images prove theory auroral displays caused in same way as on @entity6
phenomenon caused by dramatic collapse of planet 's ' magnetic tail '
ensuing disturbance of the planet ’s magnetic field results in spectacular auroral displays
