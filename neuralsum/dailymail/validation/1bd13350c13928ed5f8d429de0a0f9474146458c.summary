in his resignation letter , mr @entity8 , who was due to stand for @entity2 in @entity16 – and was tipped to come second behind the @entity17 – claimed he has been ' forbidden to speak about @entity19 favourably ' by party bosses			1
@entity2 leader @entity0 defended @entity2 mep @entity10 who compared a @entity13 minister in the @entity14 to convicted terrorist @entity15			1
@entity2 candidate @entity8 rounded on mr @entity0 for ignoring the widespread condemnation of the remark the move has piled more pressure on mr @entity10 to resign and comes just days after another candidate , @entity26 , quit in protest at the ' racist filth ' in @entity2			1
mr @entity26 , who was due to stand in the @entity30 seat of @entity31 and @entity32 , was the party 's former head of policy in @entity11			0
@entity2 has also lost two other @entity36 candidates in recent days in separate incidents			0
@entity10 @entity2 was expelled after her chief of staff was filmed allegedly attempting to make fraudulent expense claims			2
the party 's candidate for @entity43 , was suspended last week following an ' alleged incident at his workplace '			2
mr @entity10 's recent controversial comment was made during a telephone conversation with the @entity11 @entity48 earlier this month , in which he spoke about his appearance on @entity50 show @entity51			1
he claimed that @entity52 and international development minister @entity53 was supposed to appear on the programme , and said : ' @entity53 , or as i call him , @entity15 , did n't seem to turn up			1
' @entity2 's only @entity11 mep @entity10 is facing calls to resign mr @entity10 has since apologised for the remark and mr @entity0 has dismissed it as a ' joke in poor taste ' , adding today : ' that 's @entity10 … that 's the way he is			1
' but mr @entity8 told the @entity48 : ' what @entity10 said is unforgiveable - it 's racist abuse			2
it does n't matter whether it was a private comment , or a public comment , this man has public office and he needs to filter the ridiculous thoughts that come from his brain			0
' he should be dismissed from @entity2 and held to account			0
' he added : ' mr @entity0 can not dismiss something like this as a joke			2
you ca n't toss this thing off as a joke with a pint of beer			0
' if a leader can not understand that it is the effect of his words not his intention that matters then maybe he too needs to consider his position and i would be the first to welcome mr @entity0 into the political wilderness			2
' in his resignation letter to the local party , seen by the @entity48 , mr @entity8 wrote : ' since selection , i have been systematically gagged by the party ' whip ' and forbidden to speak about @entity19 favourably … ' ironically , while i am told not to talk positively about @entity19 , a @entity11 mep and member of @entity2 has used appalling language that should never be condoned and that must be described as @entity97			1
mr @entity0 has dismissed this as a joke			0
' this is a red line , therefore , that has been crossed			0
this is not a joke to me			0
' in an interview today , i have criticised both mr @entity0 and the @entity10 and for that reason , i can not and will not represent @entity2 at an election			1
' however , if the party is to progress , it must certainly deal with the thugs and bullies who currently have positions of power and whose appalling views are both tolerated and / or presented as party policy			0
' mr @entity8 was selected as the party 's candidate in february , and joined @entity2 last year after leaving the @entity17			1
earlier today , @entity2 leader mr @entity0 continued to defend mr @entity10			1
he said : ' what 's he done wrong apart from telling a joke in poor taste ? ' that 's @entity10 , he 's out there , that 's the way he is			1
there was no malintent in it			0
‎ it was a joke in very poor taste			2
i wish he would think a bit more before he tells such jokes again			0
' @entity131 arrives at the @entity132 with @entity53 - described by @entity2 's @entity10 as @entity15 but mr @entity53 , msp for @entity134 , said : ' @entity2 's pathetic response to religious hatred , racism and bigotry has exposed them as a party that is so out of touch with people that even their own senior members are abandoning them			1
' i welcome @entity8 's resignation			0
he has demonstrated that he is unwilling to be associated with a party that allows @entity97 to be rife within its ranks			0
' serious accusations have been made about @entity2 actively preventing their members talking positively about @entity19			0
@entity0 should heed warnings from his own members and demonstrate that he will not tolerate prejudice in any form by expelling @entity10 without any further delay			2
' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' @entity8 was never gagged or told that he could not speak about @entity19			2
' when mr @entity8 submitted some videos that he intended to use as a viral campaigning tool , all that his regional officers advised him to do was produce shorter videos focused on national issues such as the @entity161 , not five minutes or more discussing the nuances of @entity19 in @entity163			0

@entity10 @entity10 's said he called the @entity52 's @entity53 ' @entity15 '
@entity0 said the comment was merely a ' joke in poor taste '
@entity2 leader *rejects* *cross-party* demands to kick the mep out of the party
