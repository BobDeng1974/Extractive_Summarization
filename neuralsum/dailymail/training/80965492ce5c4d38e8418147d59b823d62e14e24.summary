by @entity0 if you thought tending to plants on @entity3 was tricky , then try growing them in the hostile environment of space			2
that ’s exactly what one scientist from @entity9 is hoping to do using meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes			1
if the study proves successful , it could help humans grow their own food in space , helping in the quest to colonise other planets			2
dr @entity22 has attempted to grow plants in nutrient - rich meteorite soil			1
‘ a variety of soil bacteria , algae , and asparagus ( pictured ) and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid / meteorite soils and also in @entity33 meteorite soils , ’ dr @entity22 reported at nearly £ 14,000 ( $ 23,000 ) to send a kilogram of food into space , cosmic cuisine does n’t come cheap			1
but dr @entity22 is n't the only one looking at space farming as a possible solution to getting food into space			1
@entity41 currently has plans for a ' space farm ' and is already experimenting with growing lettuce on the @entity45 as well as cutting costs , @entity41 is hoping a ' space farm ' will deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions			2
it could also provide something called ‘ horticultural therapy ’ for astronauts to reduce stress , alleviate depression and improve their overall general health			0
the work is part of the @entity58 ( veggie ) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink led lamps			0
@entity41 claims that after extensive testing on plants on @entity3 , it does n’t expect zero - gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants			0
as one of the world 's only ‘ astroecologists ’ , dr @entity22 thinks it is entirely possible to , in the future , directly grow certain plants on other planets			1
this will be vital for a future colony to survive on @entity33 , he claims			0
the privately - funded @entity75 mission plans to have a human settlement on @entity33 within a decade			0
meanwhile , @entity41 believes putting man on the red planet will be possible by 2030			0
but one of the biggest challenges is providing food to sustain astronauts			0
currently its costs nearly £ 14,000 ( $ 23,000 ) to send a kilogram of food into space			0
the ability to grow cosmic cuisine will cut these costs and provide astronauts with ‘ horticultural therapy ’ to reduce stress			0
dr @entity22 from @entity94 researcher told @entity95 that meteorites often contain phosphate , nitrates , and even water that plants can feed on			1
to grow the plants , dr @entity22 ground up meteorites to create something closely resembling soil			1
to grow the plants , dr @entity22 ground up meteorites , such as the one pictured , to create something closely resembling soil			1
his plan is to eventually find several different plants and extraterrestrial soil types that provide the best conditions to farm in space dr @entity22 ’s ( pictured ) experiments are at an early stage			1
for instance , he has not yet considered the lack of oxygen on other planets or gravity conditions ‘ a variety of soil bacteria , algae , and asparagus and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid / meteorite soils and also in @entity33 meteorite soils , ’ dr @entity22 reported			1
his plan is to eventually find several different plants and extraterrestrial soil types that provide the best conditions to farm in space			1
‘ given the estimated amounts of asteroid materials shows that these resources can support trillions of humans comfortably in our solar system , and eventually , in billions of other solar systems throughout the galaxy , ’ dr @entity22 said			2
dr @entity22 ’s experiment are currently at a very early stage			2
for instance , he has not yet factored in the lack of oxygen on other planets , or the varying gravity conditions			0
but , he believes , this is the first step to providing the tools needed for humans to better explore the solar system and beyond			0
‘ @entity150 is fragile , endangered by nuclear proliferation , genetic misengineering , runaway climate change or major asteroid impacts , and limited by depleting resources , ’ dr @entity22 said			2
‘ eventually , @entity3 will become uninhabitable by the expanding sun. in contrast , life in many independent worlds in space can secure life for trillions of eons			0
’ dr @entity22 is n't the only one looking at space farming as a possible solution to getting food into space			1
