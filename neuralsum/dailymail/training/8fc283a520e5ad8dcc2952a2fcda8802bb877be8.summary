by @entity0 published : 17:25 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 7 december 2012 as the @entity2 prepare to reunite briefly next week for the premiere of their new musical @entity6 ! and a major new tv show , there ’s a growing prospect this might not be the final chapter for the world ’s most successful girl group			1
the pressure to get back together is being driven by @entity14 — scary @entity2 — who has been in @entity16 judging a version of @entity18 there			1
in her first interview about the stage production and highly anticipated @entity21 special , she reveals : ‘ i keep saying to the girls , “ let ’s reunite and tour again ! ” i ’m up for it and i ’m always championing it			1
’ getting back together ? the @entity2 - from left to right , @entity14 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 - could be considering a longer - term reunion while @entity30 was believed to have ruled out performing with her bandmates — @entity14 , @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity28 — again , their well - received outing at the closing ceremony of @entity36 may have changed that			1
‘ we did n’t get paid for the @entity39 — we funded it ourselves , costumes and everything			1
it just goes to show how much we do get on and do like each other			1
but it ’s easier said than done with our schedules , ’ @entity27 adds			1
' we 're like sisters ' : @entity14 is said to be pushing for the group to get back together ‘ we ’re like sisters			1
we can bicker and make comments to each other			2
we go through highs and lows together			2
we go through fallouts and make - ups and break - ups			2
that ’s just the way we are			2
‘ we ’re five very passionate , creative girls			2
but we love each other and we ’re like family			2
well , the family you want to have			2
’ @entity27 could be referring to her high profile rift with her mum @entity62 , who , i revealed , will not feature in the @entity65 documentary			2
‘ not all the @entity66 did the documentary , ’ @entity27 says			0
‘ all i said during filming was that i adore my family			0
all of us love our mothers			0
’ @entity65 ’s cameras followed @entity27 for a ‘ few days ’ and she found it emotional looking back at the band ’s career			1
‘ it was really nice to be able to reflect , ’ she says			0
‘ it makes you feel humble and appreciative of where you come from			0
i owe everything to the @entity2			0
i would n’t be able to live or travel like i do if it was n’t for those four other girls			0
’ the world premiere of @entity6 ! on tuesday at @entity84 ’s @entity83 will see the @entity2 attend with their partners , including @entity86			1
@entity30 ’s husband ’s attendance has excited @entity65 producers because it means he will now feature in the @entity2 tv show			1
a star audience : @entity86 , left , will be joining his wife @entity30 , right , at the premiere of @entity6 ! his schedule had been up in the air as he planned his football future after @entity97			1
but he has assured his wife , who will become @entity30 again for the evening , that he will be by her side			0
‘ @entity30 ’s nervous about entering @entity102 again , but she ’s very proud of the musical , so it ’s important for her to have @entity86 there , ’ my source explains			1
for weeks , viewers have asked why @entity108 ’s judges have given @entity39 gymnast @entity109 tougher scores and critiques than his rivals			0
it was only after his near - flawless performance on saturday that @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 began to award him marks comparable to front - runner @entity119			0
i ’m told that ’s because staff on the show are well aware the heart - throb has been topping the viewers ’ phone vote for weeks and is almost assured a place in the final on december 22			1
tough critics : olympic gymnast @entity109 pictured with dancer @entity130 on @entity108 my @entity108 source reveals : ‘ it ’s been known behind the scenes for weeks now that @entity134 is a sure bet for the final			0
as a result , the judges knew there was no point giving him nines and tens every week because it would allow him no progression throughout the series			1
‘ to be truthful , they have marked him harder than the other dancers because he is a gymnast who has a natural advantage over a rival like @entity149			0
’ while i do n’t want to see the judges going easy on the celebs , it ’s been clear to me they ’ve been marking @entity134 , 23 , down unfairly for weeks			0
if anything , that has only increased his support with the public			0
barring a huge surprise over the next two weeks , it ’s hard to see a scenario where he wo n’t become this year ’s king of the dancefloor			0
@entity65 will premiere the @entity162 tomorrow night — a 1970s - style variety programme fronted by the popular boyband			1
if it ’s a success , the one - off edition could be developed into a weekly series , featuring comedy sketches and performances			0
‘ it ’s something we ’ve been working on for a long time and we hope it could become something more regular , ’ drummer and last year ’s @entity108 winner @entity169 tells me .			0
