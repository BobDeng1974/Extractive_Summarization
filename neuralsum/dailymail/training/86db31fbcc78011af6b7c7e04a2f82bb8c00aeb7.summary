scientists have recreated a beer found on a ship that sank in 1842			1
the bottles had been 165ft ( 50 metres ) underwater but were recovered in 2010			0
now a @entity6 brewery is planning to bring the replicated beer to market so punters can get a taste of the 19th century brew			1
@entity13 @entity12 from @entity6 brewery @entity15 samples beer during a press conference in @entity17 , @entity6			1
a @entity6 brewery has reproduced a replica of a beer discovered on a shipwreck from 1842 in the @entity23 archipelago between @entity6 and @entity24 the beer was found on a shipwreck in the @entity23 archipelago between @entity6 and @entity24			1
divers found 145 bottles of champagne and five beer bottles on the ship four years ago			1
sailors enjoyed a tipple of gin 200 years ago , archaeologists have found			0
a stoneware bottle recovered from the wreckage of a sailing ship near @entity39 contains a sealed flask - and experts in august said it contains booze			0
researchers found the vessel contains 14 % alcohol , and it could be a type of gin			0
details will be known after further studies			0
the bottle has been recovered from the wreck , which rests on the bottom of the @entity52 , at a depth of 40ft ( 12 meters ) , approximately 2.5 miles ( 4km ) east of @entity54			0
the remains of the ship were discovered last year , during a routine survey of the bottom , by the staff of the @entity60 in @entity54			0
@entity62 's @entity61 were then asked to study and reconstruct the beer			0
led by professor @entity65 and @entity66 , the team worked for a year to reconstruct the centuries - old brew			0
‘ based on the micro-organisms in the bottles , we were able to figure out which type of yeast and bacteria were used by the beer ’s nineteenth - century brewers , ’ said @entity66			2
‘ this information allowed us to trace the beer back to @entity78			0
’ the team says the beer is as close to the original as possible			0
one difference , though , is that malt was produced differently in the 19th century			2
this would have meant the beer back then was sweeter			0
the more recent version has a low bitterness and an alcohol content of 4.7 per cent			2
the beer was found on a shipwreck in the @entity23 archipelago between @entity6 and @entity24 ( shown )			2
@entity62 's @entity61 were then asked to study and reconstruct the beer			0
the team worked for a year to reconstruct the centuries - old brew the modern version is less sweet as malt is now produced differently			1
however it has the same alcoholic content of 4.7 per cent			1
1,700 bottles have been made ( shown ) and they can be bought for £ 90 ( $ 145 ) each			1
the beer will be mass - produced and sold by @entity6 brewery @entity15 led by professor @entity65 and brewmaster @entity102 , the team worked for a year to reconstruct the brew ( process shown right , bottle left )			1
‘ based on the micro-organisms in the bottles , we were able to figure out which type of yeast and bacteria were used by the beer ’s nineteenth - century brewers , ’ said @entity66 in total the laboratory produced 1,500 litres of the beer , creating 1,700 bottles made of hand - blown glass , just like the original			1
transporting beer in glass back in the day was unusual as most were transported in barrels , which makes the find somewhat exceptional			0
the beer will now be mass - produced and sold by @entity6 brewery @entity15			1
a bottle will cost £ 90 ( $ 145 ) , with a portion of revenues going towards supporting scientific projects such as archaeological research in @entity6 waters			1

@entity78 scientists have recreated beer that was recovered from a shipwreck
five beer bottles were found with 145 bottles of champagne in 2010
now brewers at the @entity62 have recreated the *ancient* beer
the modern version is less sweet as malt is now produced differently
however it has the same alcoholic content of 4.7 per cent
1,700 bottles have been made and can be bought for £ 90 ( $ 145 ) each
the beer will be mass - produced and sold by @entity6 brewery @entity15
