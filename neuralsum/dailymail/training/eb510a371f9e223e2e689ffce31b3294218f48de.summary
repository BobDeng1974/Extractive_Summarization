by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:05 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 24 july 2013 criticism : business secretary @entity3 took aim at the @entity5 for curbing lending to businesses furious @entity3 has accused the @entity5 of behaving like the ‘ @entity9 ’ in imposing strict lending rules which have held back the economy			1
the business secretary said tough restrictions imposed on banks to build up stock piles of money was choking off lending to small firms			1
in a further escalation of the row between the government and the @entity5 , a @entity18 source slammed the ‘ jihadist ’ tendency in @entity23 towards the banks			2
mr @entity3 ’s outspoken intervention comes ahead of figures tomorrow which are expected to show a sharp return to economic growth by up to 0.6 per cent for the last quarter			1
but the minister suggested the recovery could have come sooner if the @entity5 had encouraged more lending to businesses to help them expand and hire more staff			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ one of the anxieties in the business community is that the so called “ capital @entity9 ” in the @entity5 are imposing restrictions which at this delicate stage of recovery actually make it more difficult for companies to operate and expand			1
‘ it is clear that the main banks are failing to support good @entity47 companies in key areas like exporting and innovation , ’ he told the @entity43			0
mr @entity3 has expressed similar views before , but the strong language of his latest intervention comes less than a month into the tenure of new bank governor @entity54			2
it remains to be seen whether his remarks will persuade policymakers to soften their stance or simply harden their resolve			0
chancellor @entity60 was reported to share mr @entity3 's views			0
one @entity18 official told the ft that it was hoped that mr @entity54 would rein in the ‘ jihadist ’ tendency of the @entity5 in imposing tough rules on lenders			1
the @entity5 's new @entity67 ( @entity67 ) has ordered @entity47 's five biggest lenders to raise £ 13.4 billion to plug a £ 27.1 billion gap in their finances			1
tensions : the public attack will heap pressure on new @entity5 governor @entity54 to shift policy nationwide , @entity47 's biggest building society , was reportedly left with a £ 1 billion hole			2
two weeks ago it announced that it had been able to meet the @entity67 's demand for it to strengthen its leverage ratio - a key measure of financial strength - to 3 per cent from 2 per cent , without raising extra funds from investors			0
the fear is that in order to meet the new targets , banks and building societies will cut back on lending to households and small businesses			2
@entity91 , chief executive of the @entity92 told @entity93 's today programme : ‘ i think @entity3 is quoting other people , rather than trying to use the word himself			0
‘ but there clearly is concern in various parts of the industry about the pace at which they 're required to raise their capital ratios			0
‘ the trouble at the moment - and indeed for the last five years - is that we 've had this massive increase in capital amongst banks of £ 165 billion during a time of low economic growth			0
‘ across the banking sector as a whole , there clearly is a correlation in the short term between requiring banks to massively upgrade the amount of capital they have and the amount of lending and the amount of economic growth			0
