by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 18:06 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 14 october 2013 a @entity3 - wide study found pregnant women exposed to ' safe levels ' of pollution still have an increased risk of giving birth to small baby pregnant women exposed to ‘ safe ’ levels of air pollution still have an increased risk of giving birth to small babies , researchers have warned			1
nitrogen oxides and fine particles produced by traffic pushed up the risk of low birth weight by almost 20 per cent , a study found			1
but the impact also persisted at levels well below those imposed by @entity27 air quality directives			0
in addition , the average size of babies ’ heads was found to decrease , despite accounting for factors such as smoking , age , weight , and education , the study of 74,000 women from 12 @entity3 countries found			0
experts have now called for new measures to reduce levels of microscopic particles known as @entity44			1
the study by a @entity3 - wide group of researchers and published in @entity49 journal , found that raising the exposure to pollutants by five micrograms per cubic metre caused an 18 per cent greater risk of small babies			1
newborns weighing under 5lb 8oz can suffer health problems later in life			2
but simply cutting levels of pm 2.5 to 10 micrograms per cubic metre could prevent more than one in five cases of low birth weight , say experts			1
lead author dr @entity62 from the @entity63 in @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of cases of low birthweight at term could be prevented in @entity3 if urban air pollution , particularly fine particulate matter , was reduced			2
’ lower birthweight may cause the child health problems immediately after birth and while growing up			1
microscopic particles largely generated by diesel exhausts have previously been shown to damage the lungs and cause harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting			2
dr @entity62 said ‘ the widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policy makers to improve the quality of the air we all share			2
’ nitrogen oxides and fine particles produced by traffic pushed up the risk of low birth weight by almost 20 per cent previously exposure of pregnant women to traffic - related air pollution has been linked to pre eclampsia , and to asthma and autism in offspring			1
professor @entity108 from the @entity109 , said : ‘ unlike risk factors such as diet and smoking , air pollution is an exposure that we can not reduce through individual actions			0
‘ our research provides a wake - up call to policy makers			1
’ dr @entity120 , spokesperson for the @entity121 , said ‘ exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day - to - day life and the risk still remains fairly low			0
other factors , such as smoking , high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption , may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby			0
’ dr @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , said ‘ the size of the effect of air pollutants on birthweight was smaller than the effect associated with maternal smoking , so for individual women smoking has the largest effect on low birthweight			0
‘ for the whole population , however , air pollution has a greater effect because more women are exposed to air pollution than do smoke			0
‘ the mechanism by which air pollutants cause growth restriction is unknown , but it is plausible that environmental toxins could have a toxic effect on placental growth and function			0
