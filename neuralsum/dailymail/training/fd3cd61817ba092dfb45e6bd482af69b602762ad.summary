best known for its abject cold , @entity3 death camps , and occasional , tenuous sightings of the @entity5 , @entity0 is not the first place you might associate with glamour and fun			1
but the @entity11 ski resort of @entity12 , where temperatures can reach @entity14 , is doing its best to reinvent the notion that one does n't go to @entity0 for a good time			1
not only does the up - and - coming resort have ' the best snow in @entity11 ' , according to the @entity20 , it also boasts comparatively balmy weather which has led to a new sport : bikini snowboarding			1
as these pictures show , the snow in @entity12 is so good that it lasts from november until may , when the warmer spring sun encourages skiboarders to strip off			1
and it 's not just the young women : plenty of men have taken advantage of the sunnier conditions to strip off and ski bare - chested			1
whether they are as appealing to the opposite sex as the bikini - clad girls , remains to be seen			2
tanning while she snowboards : the bikini snowboarders have proved an unexpected attraction in @entity12 balmy conditions : the snow in @entity12 lasts til may , so holidaymakers can ski in the warm sunshine it must be cold on the chairlift , though : the snowboarders wear just bikinis and ski boots the @entity20 says that despite @entity38 's ' famous @entity0 frost , lack of apres - ski ' , and tedious eight - hour trek from @entity79 , the powder is ' dry and fast ' and its reputation as a relaxed and fun ski resort means it is fast becoming a fashionable place for @entity11 's jeunesse doree to go			1
another attraction of the resort is the forthcoming @entity86 , based on the mythical ' abominable snowman ' that some claim to have spotted in the @entity11 mountains			1
two years ago , a conference on bigfoot - type creatures , also known as @entity92 , was held at @entity93 , down the road from @entity38 , attracting experts from around the world			0
this video grab shows a young woman enjoying snowboarding in the warm sunshine in beach attire where are your salopettes ? bikini snowboarders certainly save money on the expensive ski - wear fashionable new craze : the bikini snowboarders of @entity0 need to keep their wits about them to avoid wipe - out frostbite is the freezing of the skin and other body tissues when exposed to the cold			1
the first signs of frostbite are whitening of the skin and numbness , and the skin then beings to feel waxy and firm			0
sunburn can be a big problem in ski resorts as the sun 's rays reflect off the snow			2
in the absence of protective clothing , wear a good quality sun block and reapply frequently			0
hypothermia occurs when your core body temperature dips below @entity134			0
shivering and disorientation are classic symptoms of this and sufferers may become so confused they try to take their clothes off which makes the problem worse			0
. delegates heard how evidence had been collected in the mountains nearby that pointed to a ' 95 per cent certainty ' of @entity147 in @entity148 , and local residents said they had seen a bigfoot - type being in the @entity152 cave			0
a 60 - bedroom hotel complex and amusement park based on the creature will offer families packages of skiing and yeti - hunting			0
there will also be a museum devoted to the mythical creature in the @entity86 , which is expected to take three years to build			0
@entity163 , 48 , deputy head of @entity165 's local council , said : ' we are building the @entity86 now , and of course there will be a chance for people who come here to see the creature			0
' in the meantime , the less - hairy and rather more attractive snowboarders of @entity165 are likely to be the main crowd - pullers			2
one for the girls : male snowboarders also go without their shirts , but they do n't have quite the same glamour			2
