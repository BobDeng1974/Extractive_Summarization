the @entity0 returns this weekend after the fourth interruption this season for international fixtures , leaving managers hoping their players have returned with a clean bill of health			2
the break can be both a blessing and a curse , potentially halting your momentum if results and confidence are positive , or halting your slide if all is not well			0
@entity0 sides have already had to resume their season after international breaks in september , october and november 2014			2
@entity0 leaders @entity20 have won all three of their matches following the international break @entity23 lead the post-international @entity0 table with three wins from three after the break however six @entity0 clubs are still chasing their first win after an international break this season , so who has been the best at managing this transition ? @entity33 examines this through a modified @entity0 table that takes in only results immediately after international resumptions			1
our alternative table makes nice reading for @entity23 fans , with their side winning all three matches and keeping clean sheets against @entity45 and @entity46			0
champions - elect @entity20 are the only side to match this perfect record , though both of these teams have not faced a current top seven team across their post-international fixtures			2
@entity54 and both @entity56 clubs are the only other unbeaten sides though @entity57 did slip up in drawing 2 - 2 at home to @entity46			1
@entity59 have been relatively impressive , drawing 2 - 2 at the @entity60 and most notably dispatching @entity61 chasing @entity62 4 - 1 , who have an indifferent record			0
moving further down and @entity65 have a significantly worse record following the international break than in overall form , suffering surprise defeats when visiting @entity70 and hosting @entity45			1
moreover their only win came through an unconvincing 3 - 2 victory at @entity74 , secured only through a sensational second - half display by @entity76			0
@entity57 will be hoping to follow up their win against @entity65 by beating @entity45 @entity78 are awaiting their first @entity0 win directly following an international break @entity81 ( right ) will be hoping his side can pile more post-international misery on @entity78 saturday @entity78 vs @entity65 @entity23 vs @entity54 @entity84 vs @entity85 @entity57 vs @entity45 @entity86 vs @entity87 @entity46 vs @entity74 @entity20 vs @entity88 sunday @entity89 vs @entity62 @entity90 vs @entity91 monday @entity70 vs @entity59 both the @entity92 and @entity78 will want to change the vast discrepancies between their current league table positions and their positions in our alternative view , currently sitting in eighth and 13th respectively			1
the two @entity61 sides meet on saturday lunchtime as @entity78 chase a first win following an international break this season			1
the @entity103 have been fortunate in having three home fixtures but have totally failed to capitalise on this , drawing 2 - 2 with @entity87 and @entity59 , whilst losing 2 - 1 at the hands of @entity57			1
@entity54 have handed out two thrashings to sides in the @entity109 by picking up 8 - 0 and 4 - 0 wins over @entity90 and @entity91 respectively			1
however in this table the @entity111 still make the top six through narrow 1 - 0 wins over both @entity74 and @entity84			0
the foxes have a notably improved position whilst keeping clean sheets against @entity90 and @entity88 in their three post-international games , despite these being relatively rare across the season			0
@entity74 strugglers @entity74 have lost all three of their post-international fixtures so far this season this puts @entity122 ’s side comfortably nestled in mid-table , joined their relegation strugglers @entity89			0
possibly benefitting from having fewer players occupied on international duty , both join a cluster of teams on four points			0
@entity88 will also be concerned by their poor record , which includes 2 - 1 and 1 - 0 defeats when hosting relegation - threatened sides @entity89 and @entity84			2
such results across an entire campaign may have seen them struggling to maintain mid-table stability under @entity137			0
@entity87 , @entity90 and @entity46 are all winless , though the @entity90 did claim a respectable 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity62			0
@entity86 and @entity74 are both pointless , though the @entity140 have had three games including difficult trips to @entity20 and @entity59			1
meanwhile the @entity143 ’s have hosted @entity65 whilst suffering away defeats with scoring at both @entity91 and @entity57 – @entity146 ’s team will hope to change that trend when travelling to @entity46 on saturday .			1

@entity23 and @entity20 have perfect records with three wins each
@entity54 , @entity59 and @entity57 are the only other unbeaten sides
@entity78 are still yet to win following an international break this season
@entity65 are *similarly* poor with one win and two defeats
six clubs are yet to win after an international break , find out who here *…*
