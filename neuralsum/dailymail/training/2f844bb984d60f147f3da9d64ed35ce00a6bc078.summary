by @entity0 last updated at 5:04 pm on 18th january 2012 a toddler debilitated by an abnormal growth that weighed more than the rest of his body , is able to run free for the first time following its removal			1
@entity8 , now aged 16 months , suffered from a rare lymphatic malformation on his back which caused him to fall over when he attempted to walk			1
his parents could n't let him out of their sight in case the 4.5lb mass , which had its own blood supply , ruptured and he bled to death			2
@entity17 and @entity18 with their son @entity19 , who can now run free after having a giant growth removed but now , thanks to a ten - hour operation , @entity19 is able to run around with his siblings @entity24 , 17 , @entity25 , 15 and four - year - old @entity26			1
the giant growth when it was removed , weighed 4.5lbs meaning premature @entity19 was just 3lbs when he was born			1
mother @entity17 , 35 , said : ' it was horrific what we went through but @entity19 ’s made of strong stuff			1
' he ’s just like other children his age now			2
' the growth was spotted when @entity17 and husband @entity18 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , went for a 32 - week scan			1
at first , it was not known whether the growth was attached to @entity17 or her unborn baby			1
the growth was spotted when @entity17 and husband @entity18 went for a scan mother @entity17 said : ' he 'll be scarred for life but it 's a small price to pay			1
i call it his shark bite because it looks like one			2
' but a more detailed scan revealed that the growth was in fact attached to @entity19 , and his parents feared the worse			1
they were given another blow when it was discovered it had it ’s own blood supply and @entity19 had rapidly been losing blood while in the womb			2
it was also suspected that the growth could be on his brain			1
however specialists were unable to tell because of the baby ’s position so an mri scan was scheduled for a week later			0
but the scan was never conducted as @entity17 suddenly went into labour			0
she had an emergency caesarean section because the growth could have caused the baby to get stuck , cutting off the oxygen supply			2
@entity19 was born five weeks premature and weighed seven and a half pounds including the weight of his growth			1
@entity17 said : ' they brought him to show me before he was whisked away			0
' i ’d tried to prepare myself but i did n’t know what to expect			0
' @entity19 was immediately transferred to the @entity80 in @entity81			0
there , he was diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation , which results from an abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues			1
when these vessels develop abnormally they can cause a localised swelling , often with cysts , and sometimes blood vessels can also develop abnormally in the same area			0
standing tall : @entity19 can now walk now he no longer has the weight of the malformation on his back doctors said it was too dangerous to remove the growth because it was so close to his liver and lungs and he was too small for such a major operation			1
@entity19 was kept in intensive care and doctors monitored him around the clock in case the growth ruptured and he bled to death			2
after two weeks in hospital , doctors finally allowed @entity19 ’s parents to take him home			0
@entity17 said : ' it was such a relief but we were so scared			0
we had to be so careful			0
' we were taught how to resuscitate him and were told to take him straight to hospital if he became pale or listless			0
' as he got older , i would n’t let him out my sight in case he knocked it and it bled like it did in the womb			0
' when he learnt to walk , he kept falling over because of the weight of it			1
' just after @entity19 ’s first birthday , in october last year , doctors decided it was safe to operate after a scan showed the growth had moved			2
surgeons discovered it had spread to his ribs and muscles			0
the intricate operation took ten hours as if any of the growth had been left , it could have grown back			1
@entity19 was given a blood transfusion and needed skin grafts because the scar was so large			0
after the operation , he was moved to intensive care and put on a ventilator to allow his body to recover and finally , a month later , he was allowed to go home			2
father @entity142 , sister @entity26 , four , mother @entity17 and @entity19 following his operation @entity17 said : ' he ’ll be scarred for life but it ’s a small price to pay			1
i call it his shark bite because it looks like one			0
' i ’ve got a scrap book with photos of him in hospital to show him what he came through			0
' i do n’t want him to be self conscious of his scar			0
i want him to be proud of it			0
' medics at @entity80 , @entity81 , revealed that @entity19 's case was unusual , because of the positioning of the growth , and as a result the operation took longer than the standard procedure			1
a spokesperson said : ' we ’re very pleased with how @entity19 has recovered from his surgery although we ’ll need to keep a check on him as he grows older to ensure that he does n’t develop difficulties related to his scar			0
