by @entity0 tv chef @entity2 ’s adoptive mother tried to strangle and suffocate her when she was a little girl - and thought of hurling her under the wheels of a lorry			1
the star has discovered she was placed on the at - risk register aged three because her adoptive mother told social workers she feared she might kill her			1
adopted by a white family at 18 months , the former model never knew why she was subsequently separated from her adoptive mother at the age of eight and placed into emergency foster care			1
but the presenter , 41 , has learned how a desperate @entity17 , reeling from a broken marriage , warned @entity19 social services the little girl ’s life was in danger			2
the star , who says she can not recall the incidents , said : ‘ to learn i was on the at - risk register from 1976 was enlightening , daunting and sad			1
’ in the documentary , @entity2 is left sickened by files detailing conversations between her adoptive mother and officials			2

the first memo , dated 1976 and referring to @entity2 as a child at risk , states : ‘ mother is worried about the pressure building up and feels like she is about to take it out on adopted daughter			2
' she said she had exploded and smacked the children very hard but knew she was particularly heavy handed with @entity45			0
worry : @entity17 ( pictured ) struggled to look after @entity2 when her marriage broke down			1
she grew increasingly concerned at how heavy - handed she was becoming ‘ she had always been confused about her feelings towards the child and quoted an incident when she was walking with @entity45 and a large lorry was travelling in their direction and she had looked at the wheels and thought if she pushed @entity45 under them it would solve all her problems			1
concern : @entity2 ( pictured ) was placed on at - risk register aged three by worried social workers ‘ although she has not been drinking for over two months , she is afraid if she had a drink she would not know where to stop and could not control her feelings			1
’ another note , dated 1981 , states : ‘ the mother was in an agitated state and demanded that we take her daughter into care as she could not stand her any longer			0
' she said she dreaded the school holidays and was sure she would do @entity45 some damage			0
‘ she said she had already tried to strangle her and suffocate her and had hit her before she went to school this morning			0
' she said the only way she could keep from hitting @entity45 was to keep her locked in her bedroom			0
’ in the programme , the star describes the contents of the file as ‘ devastating ’ and leaves the room to escape the cameras			0
she has subsequently been reunited with her adoptive mother , now 80 and suffering from dementia			2
