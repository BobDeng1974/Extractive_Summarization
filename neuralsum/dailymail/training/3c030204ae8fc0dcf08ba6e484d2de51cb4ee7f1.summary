a senior employee at a leading @entity2 bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates			1
the individual , whose identity is protected by a court order , yesterday became the first banker in the @entity2 to plead guilty in court following the ‘ @entity13 ’ inter-bank lending scandal			1
he is also the first senior worker at a @entity2 bank to be convicted of criminal wrongdoing since the financial crash of 2008			1
details of the guilty plea can be reported for the first time following court proceedings yesterday			2
a senior employee at a leading @entity2 bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates			1
but the gagging order regarding the individual ’s name , served by judge @entity28 at @entity29 , also prevented the ‘ leading bank ’ he worked for being identified			1
the banker is one of 12 people charged by the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) for allegedly manipulating @entity13 interest rates , which are used to set the price of mortgages and are linked to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts			1
eleven of the accused are currently awaiting trial			0
many have yet to enter formal pleas			0
yesterday ’s guilty plea was the first criminal conviction arising from the @entity34 ’s @entity13 investigation , which began in july 2012			1
the @entity47 said those found guilty of playing a part in the scandal should feel the ‘ full force of the law ’			1
@entity54 governor @entity53 has also led calls for bankers to be held to account			0
in july , he said staff at another bank involved in a scam to defraud taxpayers during the financial crisis could be guilty of ‘ criminal conduct ’			2
‘ ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets are robust , and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law is vital			2
’ the public has a legitimate interest in knowing which bankers were allegedly involved in libor rate - rigging , a judge ruled in a previous case			2
the high court judge said last year that keeping the names of bank bosses secret would be ‘ an affront to the principle of open justice ’			2
he was asked to impose an order giving anonymity to more than 100 bank staff whose emails were handed to the @entity73 watchdog during its probe into @entity13 manipulation			1
the ruling on a civil claim was separate to yesterday ’s criminal case			0
in the civil case , the judge denied anonymity to staff whose emails were handed over , even though most of them were not accused of any impropriety			0
the innocent would not be prejudiced by being named , he ruled , and the public had the right to know who was alleged to have been involved			0
he said : ‘ the public has a legitimate interest in learning who in the banking community is alleged to have been implicated in the manipulation of @entity13			1
' for the court to permit individuals who were involved in such manipulation the protection of an anonymity order is not only not necessary for the proper administration of justice , but would be an affront to the principle of open justice and would potentially damage public confidence in the administration of justice			2
’ the case was brought by a care home that said it was mis - sold a so - called interest rate swap linked to the @entity13 rate			1
conspiracy to defraud carries a jail term of up to ten years , but the date for the sentencing of the unnamed banker has not yet been set			2
in total , seven banks and brokerage firms have settled allegations of interest rate rigging in the @entity2 and @entity146			1
these include @entity148 , which was fined £ 290million in june 2012 , @entity149 , which paid out £ 390million , and @entity150 , which was hit with a £ 148million penalty			0
damning emails showed how traders bragged about moving @entity13 interest rates up and down to fix their bets on the stock market , promising each other kickbacks and bottles of champagne			1
last night , mps welcomed the conviction			0
@entity162 , shadow treasury minister , said : ‘ this is not down to a single rogue individual			0
‘ this is just the beginning of a long process of weeding out a crooked culture in banks which has deep roots			0
’ @entity172 mp @entity171 , who sits on the treasury select committee , added : ‘ whoever this banker is , his or her bosses who created the culture that allowed this to happen must be held to account			2
’ the government has made manipulating @entity13 – which stands for the @entity13 – a criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to seven years			1
the rate is based on daily submissions lodged by a panel of international banks , and is supposed to reflect the cost at which they borrow from one another			0
but some traders manipulated libor rates to favour their own short - term investments			0
they did this by conspiring with colleagues called ‘ submitters ’ , who were responsible for entering the bank ’s estimated rate each day			0
some bankers also colluded with rivals and brokers , urging them to either increase or decrease their estimates to push the overall libor rate up or down			0
@entity13 stands for the @entity203 and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other			1
the rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the @entity211			0
each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow , from overnight to 12 months			1
there are 150 libor rates , spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods			0
it heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages , such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates			0
some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to @entity13 , which are typically reset every three months			2
traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them , however , by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal			0
even those whose mortgages were directly linked to @entity13 would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect			1

first banker in @entity2 to plead guilty after ' @entity13 ' inter-bank lending scandal
gagging order prevents naming of man and ' leading bank ' he worked for
one of 12 people charged by @entity34 for ' manipulating @entity13 interest rates '
