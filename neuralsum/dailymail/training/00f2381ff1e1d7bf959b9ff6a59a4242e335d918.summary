7 @entity27 - @entity26 first half dummy left @entity16 in no - man ’s land			1
rock solid alongside his captain			0
7.5 @entity31 - @entity30 about @entity31 ’s off - field indiscretions inspire him			1
this was a colossal performance by @entity0 ’s captain			1
8 @entity31 put in a colossal performance at the heart of @entity0 's defence on sunday afternoon @entity39 and focused in a team that loves to keep clean sheets			1
this was another and he deserved to be part of it			0
6.5 @entity46 and tidy in the centre of midfield , settling in front of @entity0 ’s back four whenever they needed him			1
6.5 @entity53 - did n’t react , at times under huge provocation from @entity5 fans			1
those who applauded him yesterday deserve much credit			0
lovely chip for @entity10 ’s goal			2
7 it was a big day for ex-gunner @entity53 , playing against his former side in the blue of @entity0 @entity65 a threat when he ’s on the ball , but the nagging doubt over the winger is that he ’s better when he comes on as a substitute			2
6 @entity72 - his movement was top class , eluding defenders and making space for himself			0
the trouble is that @entity0 did n’t get him on the ball anywhere near enough			2
6.5 @entity78 first half , earning @entity0 ’s penalty and then putting the ahead from the penalty spot			1
sometimes he operates at another level			0
7 @entity8 opened the scoring with a first - half penalty after he was brought down in the box @entity10 - the guy is different class when he has a run on goal			1
his chest down and finish on the run was first class			0
@entity0 wanted a goal muncher			2

instant presence in @entity0 ’s defence			2
7.5 @entity100 ( @entity101 68 ) - brought on to help see the game out for @entity0 , did just that			1
6 @entity104 ( @entity72 87 ) - @entity72 had just been booked , @entity105 wanted to avoid a potential second yellow card			0
6 subs : @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 booked : @entity112 20 , @entity113 53 , @entity101 66 , @entity72 86 scorers : hazard 27 , @entity10 78 @entity5 @entity115 : beaten by @entity8 ’s penalty , but did n’t have a great deal to do beyond that			1
6.5 @entity119 - not a great game			2
booked early for a foul on @entity8 , could easily have been sent off for tripping @entity101 before half time			1
5 @entity123 - couple of decent interceptions on an afternoon when the @entity5 defender could n’t take his eyes off @entity10			1
hazard ’s mazy run took him past two @entity5 players and then @entity131 chopped him inside the area			1
@entity133 , daft , challenge			0
4 @entity131 had a terrible game , pictured lagging behind @entity10 as he puts @entity0 2 - 0 up @entity136 to get forward , but he had @entity101 for company down @entity5 ’s left			1
6.5 @entity139 - never quite sure whether he was supposed to be tracking @entity72 ’s runs or leaving it to someone else			0
decent enough , without making an impact			0
6.5 @entity143 - improved in the second half with a couple of slinky runs , but this was a long way from his performance at @entity150			2
6 @entity143 's performance at @entity6 on sunday was far from his impressive game at @entity150 @entity154 lob wedge into @entity16 that sadly led to @entity15 ’ injury			1
to his credit , tried to drive his team on			0
7 @entity159 impact on the game , he could n’t keep up with the pace and @entity5 could n’t get him on the ball enough			2
5.5 @entity16 - frustrated whenever he sprinted forward , looked round to find to his surprise that he had noone in support			0
this is n’t how they play at @entity170			0
6.5 @entity171 had a kick against two of the toughest central defenders in the @entity3			0
the very best strikers fined a way whoever their opponents are			0
booked for naughty challenge on @entity53			0
5 @entity179 struggled to get into the game , and capped it off with a late , naughty challenge on @entity183 substitutes @entity185 ( @entity186 69 ) - sprightly , energetic performance but did n’t get a decent chance			1
6 @entity189 ( @entity190 83 ) - nowhere near enough time to get into the game			2
6.5 @entity193 ( @entity16 79 ) - little time to make any impact			0
6 subs : @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200			0

@entity8 opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the first half
