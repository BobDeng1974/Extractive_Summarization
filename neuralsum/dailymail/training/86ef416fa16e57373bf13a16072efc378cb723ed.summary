by @entity0 @entity6 and @entity7 have been making traditional @entity9 treats with a twist - think @entity11 lemon curd coconut ice , candy floss boiled sweets and chilli and ginger ticklers - for eight years and now the pair are set to teach the @entity9 public to do the same via their first tv show			1
the couple already have two renowned sweet shops in @entity17 , several more in @entity18 , run a busy mail - order website and sell their sweets in supermarkets , department stores and smart delicatessens			1
the couple from @entity17 are now set to realise their other big dream : to demystify sweet - making and get all of us whipping up gingerbread latte fudge in our homes			1
@entity6 and @entity7 - world famous @entity17 confectioners - launch their first show , sweets made simple the new four - part series , called @entity37 , is tipped to be the biggest since the @entity38			1
starting on friday on @entity40 , the show sees the fun - loving couple put on the rubber gloves , pull out the heavy - bottomed pans and strain , squeeze , shape and lovingly craft their confections - showing you just how it 's done , step - by - step			1
their passion for sweets is infectious - and they are pretty keen on each other too			1
' we met 20 years ago at a friend 's dinner party , there was @entity58 and a hostess trolley , and that was that , ' says @entity6			2
' two decades later and we have two award - winning shops in @entity17 , lots of shops all over @entity18 , four recipe books and a tv series with the biggest broadcaster in the country			1
we 're still getting our heads around it			2
' a colourful and quirky display from @entity72 & @entity73 's store in @entity17 's @entity74 ' as a child who grew up in the north east of @entity77			2
sunday rituals included popping to the local sweet shop for @entity81 's sweets , a @entity83 bar and @entity84			1
' it 's safe to say , i most definitely had a sweet tooth			1
' despite being a keen cook since she was 18 , @entity6 led a very different life before setting up @entity72 with @entity7			1
' i worked as a creative manager for a design agency and mr. @entity92 was an 18th century chimney piece specialist , ' she says			2
' i love being in the kitchen , nothing excites me more than combining new flavours and tracking down new ingredients , and confectionery was a part of that curiosity from a young age			2
' i had the idea to set up a sweet shop ten years ago			1
@entity7 and i swapped our flash company cars and sensible salaries for a life without holidays			1
' on our first day of opening our first shop , the till did n't work ; we spent the first week trading out of a @entity112 tin			0
it 's hard to believe that ten years later , we are about to have our very own tv show			1
' in the show , the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites like @entity118 , leather roll - ups , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 sweets made simple is tipped to be the biggest thing since the @entity38 , and starts on friday the sweet shop specialises in old - fashioned favourites ; retro sweets that conjures up a childhood nostalgia when she set up shop in 2006 , @entity6 wanted to create a place where everything was exciting and unique			1
and that ethos encompassed not just the products , but the decor			0
the shops are ' our sweet flavours are simply amazing , from @entity11 lemon curd , to coconut ice , to candy floss flavoured boiled sweets - we champion new food trends and pride ourselves on being innovative and original			1
' service is just as important to us as our products and the shops			0
we provide good old fashioned service			0
we know our customers ' names , birthdays and favourite sweet			1
we will pat your dog and water your petunias			0
' in the show , the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites such as pulled butter toffee , leather roll - ups , sherbet dippers , cinder toffee and @entity162 delight			1
they will also showcase modern treats such as gin and lime truffles , @entity168 chillies , salted seashell caramels and gingerbread latte fudge			0

the central table in their @entity74 store has a giant display of tempting sweet jars ' when i got the email saying @entity196 had been commissioned i called mr. @entity92 and said , " there is good news and there is bad news … the good news is , sweets made simple has been commissioned … the bad news is , you need to buy some @entity206 "			1
' i thought to myself , " why the heck has no one done this before ? " ' i think one of the things that puts people off making their own sweets is the fear that it 's beyond them			1
they do n't realise just how simple yet exciting it can be			2
we really hope that @entity196 shows them just how easy and satisfying it can be to concoct your own flavour combinations and experiment with a different type of cooking			0
we want people to love making sweets as much as we do			1
' there are a million different recipes to be made , the possibilities are endless and it 's a huge amount of fun			2
we 're showing people how to make sweets on their kitchen table and demystifying the science			1
