the @entity0 have opted for a ' lily pad ' strategy which allows them to have troops just over the boarder from @entity6 developments have injected uncertainty in the @entity9 as the region deals with the @entity11 and fears of @entity14 's nuclear programme by @entity15 published : 07:04 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 20 june 2012 the @entity0 is planning a significant military presence of 13,500 troops in @entity18 to give it the flexibility to respond to sudden conflicts in the region			1
the study by the @entity23 examined the @entity0 relationship with the six nations of the @entity27 - @entity26 , @entity18 , @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity30 and @entity31 - against a fast - moving backdrop			2
in just the last two days , @entity26 's ruler named defense minister @entity34 as the country 's new crown prince after last week 's death of @entity38 , and @entity18 's government suspended parliament for a month over an internal political feud			0
@entity43 soldiers from 1 - 12 , @entity44 exiting from @entity6 on december 13 , 2011			2
troops could now return to @entity18 as part of a new strategy the latest developments inject even more uncertainty as the @entity9 deals with the demands of the @entity11 , the end to @entity0 combat operations in @entity6 at the end of 2011 and fears of @entity14 's nuclear programme			1
' home to more than half of the world 's oil reserves and over a third of its natural gas , the stability of the @entity58 is critical to the global economy , ' the report said			0
' however , the region faces a myriad of political and security challenges , from the @entity14 nuclear program to the threat of terrorism to the political crisis in @entity28			1
' the report obtained by @entity74 in advance of tuesday 's release provided precise numbers on @entity0 forces in @entity18 , a presence that @entity81 officials have only acknowledged on condition of anonymity			2
currently , there are about 15,000 @entity0 forces in @entity18 at @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , giving the @entity0 staging hubs , training ranges and locations to provide logistical support			2
the report said the number of troops is likely to drop to 13,500			0
several members of @entity97 , most notably sens. @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100 , @entity101 , had pressed for a residual @entity0 force to remain in @entity6 , but the failure of the two countries to agree on whether @entity0 troops should be granted legal immunity scuttled that idea			1
instead , officials talked of positioning a strong @entity0 force just across the border in @entity18			0
the strategy preserves ' lily pad ' basing that allows the military to move quickly from one location to the next			1
as it recalibrates its national security strategy , the @entity0 is drawing down forces in @entity117 while focusing on other regions , such as the @entity9 and @entity119			1
defense secretary @entity120 has said he envisions about 40,000 troops stationed in the @entity9 region after the withdrawal from @entity6			1
@entity124 : this picture taken in @entity126 yesterday shows how the region is still struggling with the demands of the @entity11 by comparison , a cut of two @entity43 combat brigades and the withdrawal of two other smaller units will leave about 68,000 troops in @entity117			1
during the @entity135 , some half a million @entity0 forces were in the @entity9 region			1
the @entity0 maintained about 5,000 troops in @entity18 from the end of the @entity135 to march 2003 , when @entity0 and coalition forces invaded @entity6 to topple the regime of @entity140			1
the @entity0 - led invasion was in response to reports , later discredited , that @entity6 was developing weapons of mass destruction			1
@entity23 chairman @entity146 , @entity147 , who asked his staff to conduct the study , said in a statement : ' this is a period of historic , but turbulent change in the @entity9			0
we need to be clear - eyed about what these interests are and how best to promote them			0
' this report provides a thoughtful set of recommendations designed to do exactly that			0
' the 37 - page report raises questions about how the @entity0 can leverage its financial aid to force change in the @entity9			2
late last year , two @entity166 - sen. @entity165 of @entity167 and rep. @entity169 of @entity170 - opposed the @entity0 sale of spare parts and equipment to @entity28 , arguing that the ruling @entity175 monarchy was violating human rights and using excessive force to crack down on protests			0
the @entity179 went ahead earlier this year with the sale of some military equipment , saying it was for @entity28 's external defence and support for the @entity185 's 5th @entity184 , which is based in the country			0
@entity28 stands as a strategic ally to counter @entity14			0
@entity0 defense secretary @entity120 has said he envisions about 40,000 troops stationed in the @entity9 region after the withdrawal from @entity6 the report said the @entity0 : ' should not be quick to rescind security assurances or assistance in response to human rights abuses but should evaluate each case on its own merits			1
' @entity0 government officials should use these tools to advance human rights through careful diplomacy			0
' the @entity0 should make clear that states must not use arms procured from the @entity0 against their own people engaged in peaceful assembly or exploit the @entity0 security umbrella as protection for belligerent action against their neighbors			0
' the report also recommended that the @entity0 promote the development of the @entity27 and the @entity214 while strengthening bilateral links to the six countries ; seek opportunities for burden - sharing on operations such as missile defense , combat air patrol and maritime security ; and push for the integration of @entity6 into the @entity225 fold			2
the report emphasised that the region is critical as a counterbalance to @entity14 , whose conventional military includes 350,000 ground forces , 1,800 tanks and more than 300 fighter aircraft			2
it also has ballistic missiles with the range to target regional allies , including @entity237 .			0

the @entity0 have opted for a ' lily pad ' strategy which allows them to have troops just over the boarder from @entity6
