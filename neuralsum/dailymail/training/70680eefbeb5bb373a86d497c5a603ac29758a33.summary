relaxed , composed , striking just the right balance between laughs and the serious business of his lifelong ambition , @entity0 has taken to the whole @entity7 experience with an ease bordering on aplomb			1
long may it continue , right ? from sit - downs with sir @entity13 to voicemails from @entity15 , massive crowds for practice days to the enjoyable oddness of individual rivals sharing a team room and a common cause , there is plenty about this week that could overwhelm the average rookie			1
as @entity0 points out , though , he ’s not exactly wet behind those trademark lugs			1
@entity7 rookie @entity0 says he 's raring to go at the age of 39 , he has seen almost everything that golf has to offer			1
and , if this can never be described as just another tournament , the fact he comes from a real @entity7 family means he is as ready as any debutant could ever be			2
‘ i am better prepared for this now than i would have been 10 years ago , ’ he said			2
‘ i think i am a better golfer and i feel ready for playing now , yeah			2
‘ you know , you try to get in the @entity7 , you know there ’s going to be things attached to it , more media and more spotlight			2
if you do n’t fancy that , well , there ’s no point in trying to get in it			2
it ’s just part and parcel			2
‘ you ’re going to get people on the tee and you ’re going to get expectations			1
the key is to just embrace that and stick to what you ’ve been doing that got you here			2
‘ it was my lifetime ambition			2
it was my goal to get here			2
i ’m proud i ’m sitting here			0
i am very excited and it is a bit surreal still , because i live so close			0
@entity0 says playing on home soil will help his @entity7 chances ‘ i ’m 39 years old			1
i ’m not a rookie to golf			0
i ’m maybe a rookie to the @entity7 , but i think having it in my home country is making it a bit easier to adapt as a rookie			0
‘ there was a point where i definitely thought it had passed me by			0
but i made a conscious effort a couple years ago to get in this one			0
especially for my generation , it ’s never going to be here again			0
‘ i think every @entity77 would want to be here			0
what ’s better than to play at @entity80 for your first one ? if i could have picked it myself , i would have picked it here			1
’ he certainly could n’t have chosen a more passionate gallery , with the crowds following him around his practice round on wednesday — still 48 hours before the main event starts — bigger than anything he ’ll have experienced at this venue			0
the fact that almost everyone outside the ropes , watching on tv or following his exploits in newspapers will be urging him on has to help , of course			0
@entity0 took some time out to sign autographs for fans at @entity80 he certainly looks far from fazed by the level of support he ’s receiving from all quarters			1
a keen football fan , more specifically a @entity105 supporter , @entity0 enjoyed tuesday night ’s pep talk from sir @entity13 as much as anyone			1
and almost as much as he liked getting a good - luck message from former @entity105 manager @entity15			1
‘ it was nice to hear sir @entity13 talk last night , ’ he said			1
‘ i thought he was brilliant			0
‘ he spoke for half an hour and then we asked him some questions , and he was very candid and open			0
‘ yeah , there ’s bits that i definitely would take away from it , not just as a team aspect , but for progression going forward			1
sir @entity13 spoke with @entity119 's @entity7 team for two hours on tuesday evening ‘ you can see why the @entity122 players respected him so much and how he won 13 titles in 21 goes			1
you can see his passion for the game and how much he loves football , and how much he loves the strategy and the game			0
‘ he misses it a bit , he said , but he ’s an absolute legend in my eyes			0
‘ i ’ve had a lot of good - luck messages , pretty much just from all my friends , and i had one from @entity15 , which was nice			1
‘ i spoke to him a couple of times , because he ’s @entity141 ’s friend and he spoke to me at the masters and then he sent me a voicemail			0
he just said : “ well done for getting in			0
you ’ll love the team environment			1
probably one of the best weeks of your life ”			0
and he ’s right , it will be			0
’ @entity0 obviously sought out his uncle @entity148 for advice ahead of this week , revealing : ‘ i spent the week with him when my gran was ill in the hospital			1
@entity0 sought the advice of his uncle @entity148 while his gran was in hospital ‘ he was sort of chatting away , basically giving us good advice , nothing new that i ’ve had from the five backroom staff or the guys on the team			1
certainly he ’s experienced enough , he ’s played in eight , been captain three times and been vice-captain , too			0
’ the one thing everyone will have been talking to the new boys about is that unique experience on the first tee			2
here at @entity80 , the underpass leading to it has been painted with images of @entity119 and @entity175 legends , captain @entity141 admitting he wants his players to feel ‘ like gladiators entering the arena ’ when they emerge into the light and noise			1
‘ i ’m hoping i ’m going to really enjoy it , ’ said @entity0 , sounding just like the boy who grew up dreaming of @entity7 glory above any individual prize as he revealed : ‘ you come under the tunnel and the last person you see is @entity189			1
@entity0 says he 's relishing the first tee at @entity80 later this week ‘ you come up the tunnel , go up the hill and walk around — and it ’s like walking into a football stadium			1
‘ it was full yesterday , they were 10 deep			0
and i hit a good drive ! so , hopefully on friday , i can just try to imagine it ’s tuesday			1
‘ the good thing for me is i ’ve never experienced it			2
your nerves are what you make them , really			0
‘ the first tee at the @entity142 was pretty good and the first tee playing at @entity207 is nice			1
‘ i know this is going to be tougher , but i ’m hopefully going to enjoy it			0

@entity211 is relishing the first tee at @entity80 later this week
