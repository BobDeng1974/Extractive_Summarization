by @entity0 published : 15:39 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 15:39 est , 29 october 2013 @entity2 police made a shocking discovery during a murder investigation at a luxury villa when they stumbled over an illegal private zoo			1
officers had been called to the home in the @entity11 district of @entity12 , in @entity13 , after a security guard confessed to a colleague that he had cut a young woman 's throat after she spurred his advances and buried her body in the grounds			1
instead , they found the zoo containing an endangered @entity23 tiger , several types of monkeys and a liger - a lion - tiger crossbreed			1
@entity27 , liger : the investigation into an alleged murder at a luxury villa in @entity2 saw officers stumble upon an illegal zoo housing a liger - a half lion / half tiger the bizarre set of circumstances were still being investigated last night as police in @entity2 searched for the owner of the villa where the young murder victim is believed to have been living , possibly as an employee			1
detectives went to the villa , after one of the security guards , named as 31 - year - old @entity45 , confessed to another guard that he had murdered the woman , known only as @entity48 , 28 , because she had resisted his sexual advances			1
after his arrest , @entity50 was reported by the @entity52 as confessing : ‘ i asked her to have sex with me and she refused			0
‘ when i forced her , she scraped my face , which upset me			0
so i ran and took a knife and then slashed her throat with it four times			0
’ the guard , who said his role at the zoo was to also feed the animals , said that after the murder he had buried the woman ’s body in the villa grounds			1
clues in the claws : police are investigation the murder and are hunting the owner of the villa where an endangered @entity23 tiger was part of the menagerie monkey business : the zoo was also home to a javan langur , left , and two siamang monkeys , right it is believed that the murder victim and the guard were both employed at the villa which housed several peacocks as well as the rare predators and monkeys his confession led to police raiding the property - and they were astonished to find animals there that most officers had never seen in their lives			1
they included a critically - endangered @entity23 tiger , a @entity99 gibbon , a langur monkey , a dusky leaf monkey , two siamang apes three @entity99 peacocks - and the liger			1
now police are hunting for the owner , who was not at the villa when detectives arrived			2
but he , or she , is expected to be charged with keeping an illegal zoo			0
‘ @entity114 that get permits to breed wild animals are conservation institutions like registered zoos , safari parks or breeding centres , ’ an official of the @entity113 , told the @entity52			0
the major concern was for the @entity23 tiger , whose species is critically endangered with only an estimated 400 to 500 existing in the wild			2
we bought a zoo : the villa is located in the @entity11 district of @entity129 ( pictured ) on @entity13 but vets said the villa ’s @entity23 tiger was ‘ healthy enough , ’ and would be moved to other zoos with the rest of the animals - all except the liger			1
‘ the presence of a new animal is not due to a natural cause and it exists because of human intervention , ’ said the official			0
‘ there are no regulations on it , so we are suggesting that the liger be terminated			0
’ his comments have outraged animal lovers throughout @entity2			2
‘ is there no zoological garden which could care for this liger instead of terminating it ? ’ asked one writer			0
‘ do n’t kill the liger - it ’s innocent , ’ said another			2
yet another writer said the suggestion that the liger would be put down was ‘ a weird attitude for a conservationist			0
the “ go ” solution is to kill it ? … if anything , take the liger and put it in a zoo			0
