by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 10 april 2013 friendly lip - smacks made by a large @entity3 monkey show striking similarities with human speech , say scientists			1
@entity11 , close cousins of the baboon that only live in the remote mountains of @entity10 , produce ' unnerving ' sounds that can easily be mistaken for human voices			1
researchers who analysed recordings of the vocalisations uncovered a structural rhythm that closely matched that of humans speaking			1
it spends much of its time foraging in grasslands			1
the species is also often referred to as the ' broken heart ' because of distinctive red markings on its chest			2
they believe the evidence points to lip - smacking - a friendly behaviour displayed by many primates - being an evolutionary step towards speech			2
' our finding provides support for the lip - smacking origins of speech because it shows that this evolutionary pathway is plausible , ' said lead scientist prof @entity48 , from the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			2
' it demonstrates that non-human primates can vocalise while lip - smacking to produce speech - like sounds			2
' prof @entity48 became fascinated by the geladas ' sounds while observing the monkeys in 2006			2
' i would find myself frequently looking over my shoulder to see who was talking to me , but it was just the geladas , ' he said			0
' it was unnerving to have primate vocalisations sound so much like human voices			0
' geladas are a highly gregarious species with a large vocal repertoire , expressed using complex facial movements			0
the new research , reported in the journal @entity74 , showed that the rhythm of gelada lip - smacking closely mirrored the gaps between syllables in many human languages			1
the @entity24 , or ' bleeding heart baboons are unique to the @entity26 highlands , the so called @entity81 in both , the rhythm corresponded to the opening and closing of parts of the mouth			1
lip - smacking displayed by other primates does not have the same speech - like quality			0
calls of other monkeys and apes typically consist of just one or two syllables and lack the geladas ' rapid fluctuations in pitch and volume			0
@entity24 lip - smacks are thought to serve a similar purpose to ' small talk ' between friends by helping to bond individuals together			0
' many verbal exchanges appear to serve a function similar to lip - smacking , ' said prof @entity48			0
vocal lip smacking might make sense as a precursor to language , @entity48 says			0
language is not just a great tool for exchanging information , ' he said			0
' it has a social function ( small talk ) and many verbal exchanges appear to serve a function similar to lip smacking			0
' researchers tracked geladas in the @entity120 in @entity10 where they recorded the unusual sounds of this species when geladas ' speak , ' there are n't discernible @entity126 words , @entity48 says			1
' however , if you are with geladas , you sometimes get the impression that people are talking around you â€” something i had n't noticed in years of working with other monkeys , ' he said			1
some other primates such as apes and monkeys produce complex sounds , but @entity48 says they do n't have the speech - like rhythm that geladas have .			1

researchers found @entity11 , close cousins of the baboon that only live in the remote mountains of @entity10 , were often mistaken for humans
recordings showed a structural rhythm that closes matched that of people speaking
