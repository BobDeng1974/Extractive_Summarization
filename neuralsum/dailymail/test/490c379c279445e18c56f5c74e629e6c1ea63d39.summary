an artist with a surreal take on the natural world uses @entity3 to create whimsical , mind - bending pictures that would give @entity6 a run for his money			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , uses ingenious retouching to create pictures of anything from a woman hanging a zebra 's stripes on the line to dry to a pair of hands knitting a green field			1
he prides himself on his digital manipulation techniques , saying : ' if the image is a success but my work goes unnoticed , i 'm doing my job well			1
' a woman in a colourful sari hangs up a zebra 's stripes on a washing line the photographer who has a background in graphic design and @entity34 , initially retouched his pictures by hand			1
once he started digital retouching he was able to turn his pictures into more complex flights of fancy			1
according to his biography on @entity41 , the artist , says the real work begins when ' lesser mortals might think that the image is just perfect			1
' the art website @entity47 says : ' @entity9 enjoys developing stunning imagery			1
he believes colour grading is paramount			0
' a painter colours a giraffe as he leans a ladder against the animal a sink is utilised as a swimming pool by a group of tiny people @entity9 's photo manipulations blend the everyday with the bizarre , such as a man in a boiler suit climbing a ladder to paint a giraffe 's distinctive coat pattern			1
in another a crystal swimming pool in which beautiful people lounge in bikinis or take a dip , is realised as a sink and instead of a giant diving board , they 're all underneath a huge chrome tap			2
in other images there 's the juxtaposition of indoors and outside , so a woman 's bed piled with feature duvets and pillows is standing on dunes by the sea - rather than in her bedroom			2
a picture called ' @entity83 , @entity84 , features a man riding a bicycle with a whole tree in his bike 's basket , which sheds leaves against the setting sun. a woman is overjoyed to find her bed in the middle of nature , by the sea a man on a bike carries a tree in his basket in this image called ' bring home nature , bring home joy ' a couple sit and admire a setting sun by their parked bikes ... on top of a forest a pair of newlyweds have a moment by a lush four poster bed in a field by some trees the top of a forest is expertly blended with a grass meadow in another shot			2
at first glance it appears that a couple are relaxing together on the grass , look closer and it 's clear that they are in fact sitting on dense tree tops			0
in an amusing image , a pair of giant hands are seen to be knitting a green textured field			2
the neat rows of crops extend outwards to the horizon but in the foreground , the knitter holds up the green yarn with its neat knit - purl stitching visible underneath it			0
hands knit a blanket field using green yarn			0
@entity9 tweeted this image with the words : ' @entity142 ' two idealistic worlds appear at once , as if on two levels of a bunk bed a group of women dressed in colourful saris collect water from a giant green bottle a photograph of @entity153 women dressed in saris collecting water to bring home is given a surreal edge			1
rather than visiting the local well , river or other natural water source , the women are seen scaling a steep ladder to reach a platform on the top of a huge green bottle full of water			2
in a shot titled , ' @entity166 favors those who make their own path ' , a motorway is being lain on the road from a giant tape dispenser , wielded by a huge hand			0
following a similar theme , in another shot a couple lay down rolls of paper printed with road markings in the middle of the desert			0
a miniature man grooms a young man 's brows using a lawnmower a giant hand holds a tape dispenser emitting the grey tarmac road being laid down a couple lay down rolls of tarmac printed on paper on a desert road a man installs a mural of the sea in the middle of the desert , creating an idyllic beach view the beautiful sea view is in fact an artificial backdrop fixed to free - standing poles on an otherwise bare desert landscape in another picture			0
in the foreground , a man is up a step ladder fixing the ' view ' in place while the tools of his trade lie on the sand			0
and a scene of hot air balloons floating over green fields and hills is not all it seems , formed of red onion ' ballons ' , broccoli floret ' trees ' and potato ' hills '			0
red onions take the place of hot air balloons as potatoes and broccoli make up the land below a little girl flies a kite in a field ... or is it a broom ? street workmen install a quaver in a series of musical notes along an electric transmission line			0
