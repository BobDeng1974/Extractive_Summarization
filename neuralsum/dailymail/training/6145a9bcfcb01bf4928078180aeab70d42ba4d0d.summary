foreign students are illegally working for five - figure salaries and claiming benefits , as well as pretending to attend courses that have no teachers			1
posed by models the ongoing ‘ significant abuse ’ of @entity9 ’s border controls by bogus students was revealed in government papers last night			1
foreign students are illegally working for five - figure salaries and claiming benefits , as well as pretending to attend courses that have no teachers			1
but a detailed @entity16 blitz planned by @entity17 against the migrants and their colleges is being blocked by @entity20 and the @entity21			1
the revelations will further fuel the row between the two sides of the @entity25 over the need to get a firmer grip on @entity9 ’s borders			1
a leaked @entity30 letter written by the home secretary reveals that , despite a concerted government crackdown on bogus colleges , ‘ abuse of the system has evolved , not disappeared ’			2
at a single college , 397 students with no right to work in @entity9 were caught earning more than £ 20,000 a year – potentially depriving @entity9 of a job			1
this suggests that , nationwide , thousands of students may be guilty of working illegally			2
at the same private college 62 students were found to be wrongly pocketing benefits			1
investigators also discovered that one college claimed it had 50 students but only 18 were attending classes			1
it had recruited 70 more to study at a campus that has no teachers			0
students were regularly found to be living too far away to attend their courses			2
one college in @entity55 had enrolled youngsters who claimed to be commuting from @entity57			2
a detailed @entity16 blitz planned by @entity17 against the migrants and their colleges is being blocked by @entity20 and the @entity21 in a letter seen by the @entity63 , mrs may warned the deputy prime minister that ‘ we need to take decisive action to protect the integrity of the system and the reputation of our education sector ’			1
she outlined a string of detailed policy proposals requiring mr @entity20 ’s approval			1
these include banning foreign students from bringing their dependants with them unless they are studying for two years or more			0
the move would lead to thousands fewer migrants being allowed to bring over wives , partners and children			0
it comes amid evidence that , to help applicants bypass border checks , universities routinely classify almost all one - year academic courses as lasting 12 months or slightly longer			0
under the current rules , this allows them to bring dependants to @entity9			2
other plans include making it easier to strip universities of the right to bring in lucrative foreign students if they flout the rules			0
universities and colleges would also be required to work with immigration officers to provide intelligence on students who had overstayed their visas			1
a pilot scheme at @entity104 and @entity105 has led to 30 students who had remained in @entity9 illegally leaving the country			1
@entity17 has outlined a string of detailed policy proposals requiring @entity20 's approval			2
these include banning foreign students from bringing their dependants with them unless they are studying for two years or more ( file picture ) but mr @entity20 and other @entity115 dems are blocking the proposals , which are now locked in @entity30 stalemate			1
the party has repeatedly attempted to water down controls on foreign students			0
@entity115 dem business secretary @entity120 considers the students to be vital to the success of the education sector			0
mrs may ’s letter makes clear that widespread abuse continues , despite the government stripping dozens of colleges of their licences since 2010			0
the four - page letter , dated february 19 , states : ‘ we have ended the industrial scale abuse of our student visa system while protecting our world - class universities			0
‘ [ but ] our ongoing work has uncovered evidence of significant abuse of the student route by institutions acting negligently or deliberately			0
’ mrs may ’s plan to make it easier to remove the licences of colleges that sponsor bogus students is proving particularly contentious			2
under existing rules higher education providers keep their ‘ trusted status ’ even if 20 per cent of their students are later rejected by the @entity16 because officials do not think they are genuine			1
mrs may wants to cut this threshold to 10 per cent			0
there are 1,700 education institutions with highly trusted status			0
around 105 have between 10 and 20 per cent of students rejected			0
of those , around 70 are colleges and the remainder include independent schools and universities .			0
