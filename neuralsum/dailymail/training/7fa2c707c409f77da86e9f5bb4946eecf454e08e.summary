aliens may have sent microorganisms to @entity3 inside metal balls to create seed life on our planet , an astrobiologist has claimed			1
dr @entity8 claims to have found a tiny metal sphere that was oozing a ' gooey ' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the @entity3 's stratosphere			1
the @entity14 and the @entity16 scientist says that the ball , which is about the width of a human hair , could be an example of directed panspermia - where life was deliberately sent to @entity3 by some unknown extraterrestrial civilisation			1
@entity36 is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe , hitchhiking on comets or meteorites			0
for example , life such as extremophiles , capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space , could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			2
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets			0
the idea of directed panspermia , however , suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations professor @entity62 , one of the biologists who discovered the structure of dna , examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973			0
however , professor @entity62 and his ccolleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was ' inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability '			0
however , he has conceded it is virtually impossible to prove that the tiny sphere was sent by aliens from outer space			1
dr @entity8 said the sphere made a tiny ' impact crater ' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere			1
he said : ' the sphere made an impact crater on the sampling stub			1
this proves beyond doubt that the particle was travelling at speed from space when it was sampled			2
' dr @entity8 and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere			1
using x-ray analysis to examine the sphere , he concluded that it was made from titanium and traces of vanadium , while the material appearing to come out of the side was biological			2
they found that it also had a ' fungus - like knitted mat - like covering '			0
he claims that it could have been carried to @entity3 on a comet or even sent by an unknown civilisation			2
dr @entity8 and his colleagues have published their findings in the @entity114 but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists			1
the journal often publishes papers on astrobiology but is highly controversial among scientists as it has been criticised for its peer review process and for publishing papers of a fringe variety			0
the scientists collected the samples from the stratosphere , seen above from a weather balloon two years ago it controversially published a paper that claimed to have identified fossils of microbiotic life in a meteorite , sparking a blaze of publicity , but was also met with a great deal of skepticism			0
in the past professor @entity8 and his team claimed to have found fragments of single celled algae called diatoms in samples taken from the stratosphere			2
the idea that life can survive high the @entity3 's atmosphere , however , is not new			1
scientists working with @entity147 recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the @entity3 's surface			1
however , most scientists believe they are likely to have been carried up from @entity3 rather than having an extraterrestrial origin			0
air currents and winds are known to be capable of carrying dust and bacteria for hundreds of miles and high into the atmosphere			2
but some research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the @entity3 's atmosphere from space , raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here			1
dr @entity8 used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere some astrobiologists believe life started on @entity3 after being carried here on a comet or asteroid , while others believe it is more likely that the basic chemical building blocks were carried in this way rather than established life			1
however , the idea of directed panspermia has been proposed by some heavyweight scientists			0
professor @entity62 , one of the team who one a @entity181 for discovering the structure of dna , examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the @entity3 by intelligent beings from another planet			2
however , he concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim			0
dr @entity8 , however , insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence			1
however , he added : ' unless of course we can find details of the civilisation that is supposed to have sent it in this respect it is probably an unprovable theory			0
' professor @entity199 , an astrobiologist at the university of @entity201 and editor of the @entity114 who also worked with dr @entity8 on the study , added : ' i think more work needs to be done on this particular structure , for example to study its dna , if it has any			1
' but already there is clear proof from many directions to confirm that we are constantly bombarded by fragments of comets that carry living microorganisms			0
' however , @entity216 , author of the @entity217 , said the idea that such material were being sent out by aliens attempting to seed other planets was a ' leap of the imagination '			0
he said : ' this would seem to provide proof that outer space and not just the surface of our planet is teaming with life			1
' i 'm sceptical about this and we would need to collect more samples like this to have a better idea of where it originates from			0
' it is a leap of the imagination that it came from an @entity241 race trying to seed our planet with their biological constructs			0
‘ perhaps there are luminous or ‘ invisible ’ jelly - fish like creatures that inhabit our skies , or microorganisms flooding our planet , i ’m not convinced , but they are fascinating ideas that make a change from stories of starships loaded with aliens			0

dr @entity8 from the @entity14 used balloons to collect samples of dust and particles 16 miles up in the @entity3 's atmosphere
in one sample he found a tiny metal ball that left impact crater in the *device*
he claims the orb may have been travelling fast as came from outer space
the metal ball is the same width as a human hair and is made from titanium
dr @entity8 says it could have been sent to @entity3 by intelligent alien life
he claims a gooey substance was oozing out of the ball and is biological
