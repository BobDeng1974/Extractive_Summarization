despite some experts claiming it ca n’t be done , the race is on to build a robot with the same kind of consciousness as the human brain			0
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are just some of the tech giants developing systems designed to be more autonomous and intelligent than what ’s come before			1
but according to one analyst , there is a clear leader ; a firm that will reach the pivotal milestone before anyone else - and that 's @entity7			2
an analyst believes @entity7 is in the best position to create the first ever conscious machine and already has related projects in the place			1
it recently bought a number of robotics firm , such as @entity28 pictured , for example			0
the analyst claims conscious machines could be developed within the next 20 years machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence			1
there are already intelligent machines that can learn from their mistakes and fix errors , but many of these are programmed to do so			0
for example , world chess grandmaster , @entity40 , was defeated by @entity9 ’s ‘ @entity43 ’ supercomputer in 1997			1
another @entity9 - developed computer , called @entity45 , won the tv game show , @entity47 , in 2011 by answering general knowledge questions posed in natural language			1
it has more recently been used as a customer call centre agent			0
@entity52 , @entity53 and @entity7 ’s self - driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans			1
to become conscious , @entity60 said systems would need to be able to look at the rules the humans had programmed , to identify inconsistencies or gaps and report back			2
alternatively , they would be able to discover errors in algorithms and consciously fix them without being asked			0
‘ we can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in existing @entity7 products like @entity74 , the search function that forms part of @entity76 and @entity7 ’s self - driving car project , ’ explained @entity68 from @entity69			1
‘ a string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence , along with the recent hiring of @entity83 as a director of engineering shows that @entity7 is by no means done with machine learning : it is clear that the company is just getting started			1
‘ taking into account the present scale of @entity7 ’s computer network , the size of its user base and its capital reserves , @entity7 is well placed to take on something as ambitious as machine consciousness			1

@entity52 , pictured left , @entity53 and @entity7 ’s self - driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans			2
@entity74 , in particular , pictured right , uses predictive analysis to make educated guesses about what phone owners need @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity7 ’s self - driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans			2
@entity74 , in particular , uses predictive analysis to make educated guesses about what phone owners need - from traffic information , diary appointments and weather reports			0
the comments were made by @entity68 , pictured , who is chief analyst at @entity69 ‘ if we define an intelligent machine as something that exhibits useful behaviour that is understandable , predictable and controllable , then a conscious machine is not just intelligent but it can autonomously adapt and optimise within its own environment , ’ continued @entity60			1
‘ @entity9 ’s @entity43 defeated @entity40 using a ’ brute force ’ approach , which involved running through millions of possible outcomes for each move			1
@entity43 ’s ‘ intelligence ’ arose from its ability to apply a set of human - defined rules			0
within this narrow sphere , @entity43 exhibited signs of intelligence , but it was not conscious			0
’ to become conscious , @entity60 said systems would need to be able to look at the rules the humans had programmed , to identify inconsistencies or gaps , and report back			2
alternatively , they would need to be able to discover errors in algorithms and consciously fix them without being asked			0
@entity159 , @entity9 and @entity160 are each already working on neuromorphic computing , which uses new physical structures to replicate others			0
the @entity165 - based @entity164 , meanwhile , has attracted € 1.5 billion of @entity167 money to deliver an electronic - software model of the human brain in 10 years			0
although several years behind @entity172 ’s @entity164 , the @entity171 government has also committed initial funding to the brain initiative , which is working to ‘ revolutionize our understanding of the human brain ’			0
earlier this month , researchers from @entity178 created the @entity179 , pictured - a computer chip based on the human brain that is 9,000 times faster than current computers			0
the $ 40,000 ( £ 23,600 ) circuit board mimics the brain on the power it takes to run a tablet computer in 2011 @entity9 's @entity45 computer competed against @entity47 's two most successful contestants , @entity190 and @entity191			2
during the practice match @entity45 was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer			0
in the majority of cases @entity45 beat both contestants earlier this month , researchers from @entity178 created the @entity179 - a computer chip based on the human brain that is 9,000 times faster than current computers			0
last week , a mathematician announced robots will never have feelings and never develop consciousness			0
this is because a mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness proves it is impossible to build an emotional machine			2
professor @entity213 , from the @entity214 in @entity215 , said computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling			0
this is because the mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by professor @entity223 at the @entity224 , states the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness			0
‘ many people , including highly respected people in the tech world – like @entity232 , co-founder of @entity159 , believe that we will never be able to create a conscious machine , ’ added @entity60			1
‘ i used to think that way , too , but i no longer do			0
' instead , i now believe that the question is not whether artificial machine consciousness will arrive , but when it will arrive and what form it will take			2
’ even ‘ partially conscious ’ machines , according to @entity60 , would transform the world when combined with their ability to process vast amounts of information almost in real time			2
he added that although the thinking behind machine consciousness can create issues with the belief of humankind and spirituality , he sees it as ‘ just another phase in the evolution of the human species			1
’ the consensus among supporters on when machine consciousness will be achieved is between 10 and 20 years			1
‘ while that is a long time , it should be remembered that this is shorter than the age of the mobile communications industry and , certainly at 10 years , is close enough for this technology to have an effect on the valuations of companies , including @entity7 , ’ continued @entity60			1
the stage on from machine consciousness , is machine self awareness			2
@entity68 from @entity69 said : ' we can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in @entity7 's self - driving car project , ' pictured			1
he added few companies have such a track record in investing in visionary technologies as @entity7 @entity60 added : ' a string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence , along with the recent hiring of @entity83 as a director of engineering shows that @entity7 is by no means done with machine learning : it is clear that the company is just getting started			1
' @entity83 is pictured @entity60 defines a self - aware machine as one that is ‘ intelligent , conscious and can also take autonomous action to increase its own intelligence or consciousness			1
' ‘ if there ever was a @entity297 in tech , then it would have to be machine consciousness			2
‘ @entity7 ’s development path strongly indicates that this company will be the first to find the grail and see what ’s inside – at which point everything changes			2
’ ' whoever reaches consciousness first will be able to race ahead of the competition : the victor will be able use their conscious machine to accelerate its own rate of progress			1
' the further ahead the leader gets , the faster he is able to run			0
eventually , competitors are left so far behind that they can not catch up			0

analyst believes @entity7 is in the best position to create the first machine
consciousness is a step beyond machine intelligence seen in @entity9 ’s @entity45 supercomputer , for example
a conscious machine could identify and correct errors without being asked
@entity60 claims @entity7 already has projects in place that are taking steps in the right direction for machine consciousness
he adds conscious machines could be developed within the next 20 years
@entity68 also believes development is ' the next phase in evolution '
