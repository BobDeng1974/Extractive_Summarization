@entity0 looks stunning on the the latest cover of @entity2 - but more importantly the scandal star looks like herself , following last month 's controversy in which @entity5 came under fire for allegedly altering her appearance on its march issue			1
@entity2 's cover shot featuring the beautiful 38 - year - old actress , who donned a smokey eye , tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine 's april issue , is a far cry from the unnatural - looking pictures that @entity5 had debuted over a month ago			1
when @entity0 happily shared the @entity5 images on her @entity20 last february , fans became outraged , accusing the magazine of allegedly whitening her skin and altering her features - which @entity5 quickly denied			1
' we have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph , concerned that @entity0 's skin tone was lightened , ' @entity5 said			1
' while we did not digitally lighten @entity0 's skin tone , our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern			1
' the magazine added : ' we understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt			2
we are listening , and the feedback has been valuable			0
we are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward			0
' posting on her own @entity56 account , @entity0 thanked the publication for making such a ' beautiful statement ' , adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an ' important ' conversation			2

different person : @entity5 came under fire last month for allegedly altering the scandal star 's appearance on its march issue ( pictured )			1
the magazine blamed her seemingly altered skin tone on the ' lighting ' style star : earlier this week , @entity0 posed for photos at @entity100 's @entity99 close cast : she also smiled while taking a group selfie with @entity103 and her scandal co-stars ' when i think about any of the missteps in my life that i 've made , all of which i 'm grateful for , it 's because i just so wanted to be truly seen and heard for who i am and was afraid i was n't or would n't be			1
' she added : ' i see you , i hear you , i 'm with you as you are			0
' @entity0 also noted that she never felt particularly beautiful when she was younger			2
the actress , who attended the @entity115 in @entity116 with @entity117 , noted : ' i did n't grow up thinking i was pretty			0
