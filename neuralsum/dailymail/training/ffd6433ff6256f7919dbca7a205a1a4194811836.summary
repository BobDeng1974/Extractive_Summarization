by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:13 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 04:57 est , 30 october 2013 a new , smaller version of @entity4 's space shuttle is now recuperating from a rough first landing			1
the @entity7 space plane is vying to carry astronauts to and from the @entity9 in four or five more years			1
designed by @entity10 , the @entity10 - based company tested a full - scale model at @entity13 in @entity14 on saturday			2
everything worked well for the automated @entity7 model until the end , when the left landing gear deployed too late and the test vehicle skidded off the runway			0
@entity33 space systems chief @entity31 said tuesday that damage was minor			1
the left gear was still attached and the tire was n't even shredded , he said			0
the crew cabin area was unscathed and astronauts would have been uninjured , he said			2
dream for the future : everything worked well for the automated @entity7 model ( seen in an earlier photo ) until the end , when the left landing gear deployed too late and the test vehicle skidded off the runway the flight computers never stopped working , and nothing critical was damaged			0
@entity31 stressed that the minute - long test flight was a success despite the ending			0
he said the mishap is likely due to mechanical failure ; an investigation is underway			0
he said it should n't hold up plans for a piloted landing test next year			0
the landing gear is derived from f - 5 fighter planes and not the same type that will be used in space			2
the test vehicle will be repaired and may fly again , @entity31 told reporters during a teleconference			0
' dream ' goal : this artists rendering shows what designers hope will happen in that it will be able to transport astronauts to and from the @entity9 in a few years time @entity10 - one of several @entity72 companies hoping to carry @entity4 astronauts into orbit - plans the first orbital flight demo of @entity7 in 2016 and the first crewed orbital mission in 2017			1
@entity4 already is relying on private industry to ship cargo to the space station , a vacancy created by the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011			1
until @entity72 companies provide a safe spaceship for crews , @entity4 will continue to fly its astronauts on @entity89 @entity88 capsules - for hefty prices			1

the mini version of @entity4 's space shuttle will hopefully carry astronauts to and from the @entity9
