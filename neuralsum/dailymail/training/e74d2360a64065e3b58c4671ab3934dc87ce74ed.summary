the study has found that inviting good guests can make even make an everyday dinner transform into a feast , even if the food is quickly thrown together			1
researchers have found that a memorable meal does not automatically require sophisticated food lead author dr @entity18 said : ‘ a memorable meal is not necessarily linked with sophisticated foods or elaborate events			2
‘ in fact , some meals were spontaneous or the foods very simple			0
however , it was often reported that , regardless of the type of food , the meal was really tasty			0
‘ this suggests that the rest of contextual factors might have contributed to make the food ‘ taste ’ very good , or at least to it being remembered as such			2
’ the researchers from @entity33 in the @entity34 interviewed 886 people in @entity36 for an online survey			1
diners were asked to recall a memorable meal and to rate each aspect on a scale of one to seven			0

the researchers found that simple food was more than enough if the invited guests were suitably entertaining the atmosphere came third and the mood of the diner came in fourth			1
the type of meal was fifth , followed by other activities taking place and then how often these memorable occasions take place			0
meals which are memorable for the occasion , such as @entity2 dinners , weddings and birthdays , were excluded from the survey			1
dr @entity18 added : ‘ overall , the most important aspects of memorable meals were the company - who else was present during the memorable meal			0
‘ we would like to emphasise that memorable meals , as occasions that are often and positively remembered by consumers , seem to include a dimension related to emotions and overall well - being			0
‘ in this body of evidence , this component was reflected in the expressions used by the consumers and in the high importance ratings given to how they felt emotionally during that occasion			0
