@entity0 made a fist of making the statement he needed , even though he could not quite apply the exclamation required to put the seal on his winning of the @entity8 super-middleweight title			1
this victory over defending champion @entity10 brings with it not only a belt but the prospect of a mandatory challenge to @entity15 world champion @entity14			1
as evidence that his self - belief and ring - craft have survived that knock - out from hell by @entity23 , this performance was impressive enough			1
@entity0 lands on @entity10 as he heads for a unanimous points win in @entity25 @entity0 was in control throughout but was unable to deliver the knockout blow against the @entity28 @entity29 10 1 9 10 2 9 10 3 9 10 4 9 10 5 9 10 6 9 10 7 9 10 8 10 9 9 10 10 10 9 9 11 10 10 12 10 118 totals 112 but @entity0 will need to bounce back significantly higher when and if he takes on @entity14 and he must hope that his new @entity31 promoters have pockets deep enough to make the @entity33 an offer to come to @entity35 which he can not afford to refuse			1
@entity36 is capable of raising his game , again , and has earned the right to prove as much			0
although he admitted : ‘ i want to knock people out and i could n't do that , but i gave it a real good go			0
’ the loyal londoners in @entity44 were satisfied with that and roared their approval of a self - assessment as honest as the fight was entertaining			1
if not 80,000 at the @entity50 next door when he was knocked into the blue yonder by @entity23 , who was at ringside commentating for @entity53 , an attendance of 6,300 in the @entity44 was highly respectable after two defeats by the @entity56			1
@entity0 ( a @entity57 fan ) celebrates with @entity59 duo @entity58 ( right ) and @entity60 after his victory the @entity62 threw almost 1,000 punches to win by unanimous decision in front of a passionate home crowd @entity0 is now the @entity8 champion but has his sights set on winning the world title next @entity0 knew he needed to make an impression and raced into the fight at blistering speed , winning the first seven rounds on my card			1
the left jab was piston - like in the first half of the bout and the right hooks razor sharp			0
but the longer the @entity28 survived the more he edged into the affair and there was slight frisson of concern about @entity0 ' stamina			1
he conceded that he had to pace himself in the later stages , which was acceptable since he risked punching himself out			0
@entity10 edged a round or two towards the end			0
and he raised his own question mark about the @entity36 ’s power by dropping his hands after being caught with a snappy combination and beckoning his challenger forward			0
the verdict was decisive enough , 118 - 110 according to two of the judges and 117 - 111 on the card of the other			1
i had @entity98 winning by 118 - 112			1
@entity0 is now the mandatory challenger to @entity15 world champion @entity14 ( right ) @entity0 entered the ring to a @entity101 reading of ‘ cry @entity102 for @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , ’ followed ’ by his brass band ’s rendition of ‘ @entity110 ’ and roars from his army of fellow @entity109			1
there were boos , of course , for the @entity8 champion from @entity28			1
@entity0 was businesslike from the first bell , dictating with his left jab and landing some early right crosses			2
the odd flurry came from @entity10 but it was clearly @entity98 ’ round			0
he maintained the blistering opening pace in the second session but @entity10 changed up a gear and was more competitive in the exchanges			0
@entity0 was clearly going for a quick finish but his face reddened , even though this was another impressive round			2
@entity10 was rocked by a succession of big rights but fought back , to the disappointment of fans sensing blood			0
@entity0 was also working well to the body but there was no sign yet of the @entity28 wilting despite the punishment			2
@entity138 celebrates his win over @entity10 at the start of the fourth , the pace had to slow a little but @entity0 was still dictating from behind a ramrod left jab			1
@entity10 did stop him in his tracks with a solid right and @entity0 walked onto another at the bell but it was still the @entity36 's round			1
@entity0 , fully committed on the front foot , continued to be first with the jab			2
it helped that @entity10 did not appear to have the power to hit him like @entity23 , even though he was throwing defence to the wind at times and getting caught by some counters			2
@entity10 was enjoying a little more success as the fight approached the midway mark while @entity0 was losing a little accuracy and was forced on to the retreat for the first time			1
but it was still not quite enough to stop the rounds slipping away from the @entity28			0
@entity10 was presumably hoping @entity98 would weaken late – as he did twice against @entity23 – but there was no sign of it by the seventh stanza			2
another @entity169 round , even though this was again a little closer			0
@entity10 was holding the middle or the ring and fully in the fight by the eighth and came out equal from a thunderous exchange on the ropes – and in a round for the first time			0
@entity0 was missing more and his corner was urging him to keep the initiative but he had to ride more accurate @entity28 combinations and lost a round for the first time with three to go			2
the challenger landed big - time lefts and rights but @entity10 took the shots , dropped his hands and beckoned the @entity36 forward – somewhat unwisely			2
@entity0 found a second wind to raise his work - rate again after the disappointment of the ninth to win this one but looked the more weary as they trudged back to their corners			1
@entity10 landed the cleaner punches in the penultimate round , while the big blows from @entity98 were more sporadic			0
although he had the decision - and with it the title – in his pocket , he dropped another round			2
@entity0 was blowing – but still throwing , albeit mostly off target or blocked punches			2
his chin withstood a big right – before the new and old @entity8 super-middleweight champions embraced at the final bell			0
@entity209 continued his fine form against @entity211 on the undercard at @entity44 @entity0 speculated that he could fight @entity23 for a third time , although the @entity56 will be having no truck with the appeal , no matter how loudly the local fan club scream at him			1
the @entity56 has bigger fish to fry , if he decides to box again			0
but the @entity36 is back , on the road to redemption , chasing a world title of his own			0
meanwhile , earlier in the evening there were victories for the @entity225 and @entity226			0
the former , and elder , stopped @entity228 in the second round while his sibling went the six - round distance with @entity232			0
there was also an eighth straight win for @entity209 who knocked out @entity211 in the seventh			1
he faces a much tougher task against @entity238 in @entity239 next month .			0

@entity0 won by unanimous decision at @entity44
he is the new @entity8 champion after a decisive win
@entity0 is also the mandatory challenger to world champion @entity14
this was the @entity62 's first fight since losing to @entity23 in may
the judges scored the fight 118 - 110 ( twice ) and 117 - 111
on the undercard , @entity209 extended his *unbeaten* record
