by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:48 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 21:39 est , 24 december 2013 a @entity4 teen was kicked out of high school three years ago after telling officials she was raped and police declined to press charges			1
@entity9 , now 20 , was raped by a classmate in the band room at @entity12 , in @entity4 , in december 2010			1
instead of seeing her attacker get justice , she was given 45 days in disciplinary school			1
ms @entity16 chose to speak about the incident to @entity19 after the recent wave of high school rape cases that saw allegations swept under the rug and accusers shamed by their communities			1
devastated : @entity9 was kicked out of high school because she told school officials she was raped officials decided the sex was consensual , charged them both with public lewdness and booted them from school - she received the same punishment as the boy she says raped her			1
her attack happened on school grounds , but the first teacher she told of the horrifying ordeal told her to ‘ work it out with the boy , ’ she said			1
the young boy , unnamed because he was a juvenile at the time , asked the devout @entity41 to go to the band room one day after school for a talk			1
she went , and security footage of her accompanying the boy would later be used against her because the visit was n’t against her will - because she was n't forced			1
the boy ’s intentions became clear once the pair was behind closed doors , he became violent and raped her despite her repeated pleas to stop			1
she said no - he forced her			1
he stole her innocence , robbed her of her dignity			0
it would n't be the first indignity she 'd suffer because of him			0
i pulled my pants up and went to the bathroom to clean myself up , ’ she said about the immediate aftermath			0
shocking : ms @entity16 's accusations were swept under the rug , her mother said she immediately told the band director			1
‘ work it out with the boy , ’ he told her			1
‘ there 's no way i would do that , ’ she recalled			0
‘ but i did n’t know what to think			0
’ the teen suffered more indignity later that night while attending a @entity75 meeting			0
she sat silently with her mother , stepfather and young brother – her attacker was also in the room			2
‘ i did n't tell my parents , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n't want them to have to go through that			0
’ ms @entity16 is not alone in that feeling of isolation			1
only 40 out of every 100 rapes are ever reported , according to the @entity87			0
she skipped the next day of school , but then returned to tell the assistant band director of the attack			1
he immediately passed word to school officials , soon the police – and her parents – were involved			1
scene of the crime : @entity12 , in @entity4 , is where ms @entity16 says she was attacked the shattered teen 's worst fears were realized , her mother ‘ had this look in her eyes , like she had died , ’ she said			1
you stay dead for a while , ’ mother @entity106 said			0
‘ you become another person			0
i 'm not the same person i was before this			0
’ the result of a medical exam obtained by @entity19 showed significant proof of an attack ‘ consistent with information given per victim , ’ including lacerations to the hyman and bleeding			0
she gave an interview to investigators during which she was numb , ‘ i just felt like i could n't cry anymore , ’ she recalled			0
one day later police determined the sex was consensual , no charges would be filed			1
‘ i was so shocked , ’ her overwhelmed mother said			0
‘ i thought , they are pushing this under the rug			2
she 's being treated this way because she 's a female			2
’ @entity132 declined to comment when reached by @entity19 , a @entity134 filing to obtain case files was denied on ground the accused was a minor at the time			2
a large discrepancy : ms @entity16 's attacker was one of the 97 out of every 100 accused rapists that walk free among the evidence used to cite a burden of proof was the security footage , which showed the girl voluntarily entering the band room			1
the physical evidence could have come from either consensual sex or an attack , police said			2
‘ i ’m not saying i did not want to do it , ’ investigators said she told them , but did not provide any further context			2
the two teens were charged with lewd conduct and shipped off to disciplinary school for 45 days – together			2
only three out of every 100 supposed rapists ever spends a single day in prison , according to @entity87			0
the boy trash - talked to her to other students			2
one taunted the girl , telling her she ‘ asked for it			0
’ a relative of the boy cyber bullied her on @entity172			0
happiness at last : ms @entity16 recently married @entity175 , she finally feels happy again a subsequent @entity177 investigation by the @entity178 found the school retaliated against ms @entity16 for reporting the incident			1
changes were ordered , the school was required to pay for her counseling			2
ms @entity16 is trying to move on with her life			1
she is now happily married to a fellow student she met at college			0
he supported her decision to go public			0
‘ i 'm as happy as can be right now , ’ she said , adding that her attacker ‘ took away my joy , but i got it back , double-fold			0
’ she is studying criminal justice and criminal psychology to eventually help other girls find the justice she never did .			2

@entity9 , now 20 , says she was raped three - years - ago at @entity12 , in @entity4
she told the band director , he dismissed the allegations
school officials eventually took *action* - but only to punish her after police declined to press charges
ms @entity16 chose to speak out now after a raft of young female rape victims have had their accusations swept under the rug
