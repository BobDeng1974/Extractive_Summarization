by @entity0 published : 16:56 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 18:31 est , 26 june 2012 the @entity1 from @entity3 tower above their countrymen			0
@entity6 , 52 , who works in the @entity7 , stands 7ft 1.5in tall ; his wife @entity8 , 46 , is 6ft 2.6in and their daughters , @entity11 , 22 , and @entity12 , 16 , are 6ft 4in and 6ft 1in tall respectively			1
their combined height is a staggering 26ft , almost			0
@entity16 's tallest family is likely to set a new @entity18 record for being the world 's tallest			2
mr and mrs @entity21 were crowned @entity16 's tallest couple by the @entity23 a year after they married in 1988			0
the @entity21 family can only ride scooters and wears custom made clothes and shoes while the recognition did make them feel good , it came after both faced years of teasing and ridicule as they grew up			1
' in three years of college life , i was all alone			0
' i did n't have any friends because i was so tall			2
it was only after i started getting publicity that people began interacting with me , ' @entity6 said			1
when he hit 7ft as a teenager , he ploughed his energies into sports and ended up playing basketball for the country			2
but @entity8 struggled to fit in her native village			1
the pair began to accept early on in their teens that marriage might be difficult			0
' i was a basketball player and travelled the length and breadth of @entity16 for tournaments			0
but i was never able to find a girl who came close to my height			0
the @entity21 family : @entity6 ( right ) and his wife @entity8 ( second left ) and their daughters @entity12 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) stand a combined 26ft tall the tallest i found was around 5ft 10 in			1
i had even decided not to marry and was planning to adopt a child			0
but , as chance would have it , one of @entity8 's relatives saw me , ' @entity6 said			1
it was actually @entity8 's grandmother who spotted him walking down a street in @entity69 one evening and approached him			1
@entity6 said : ' this lady came up to me and asked if i was single and if i would meet her granddaughter who was over 6ft tall			1
i did n't believe her and refused , but my friends persuaded me to take her number			0
' a few weeks later , @entity6 's parents called the number and a meeting was arranged for the couple			1
' when i met @entity8 , i was happy			1
and i knew we would be happy together , ' @entity6 said			2
but he added that even now , the family faced problems , albeit of a different kind			2
they ca n't use public transport such as trains and buses , and even four - wheelers are a nono because @entity6 ca n't accommodate his knees inside			1
walking tall : @entity91 ( second from right ) and her sister @entity12 ( right ) tower above their friends on the move : mr @entity6 travels around on a scooter because he is too tall to use public transport comfortably the family prefers scooters for road travel and when flying is necessary , they ask for a front seat or the emergency exit row			1
being tall also means the four have to cope with people staring and talking behind their backs			2
' it does n't bother me and @entity8 anymore but our daughters get perturbed , ' @entity6 said			1
the @entity112 have wardrobes full of custom - made clothes and shoes			0
and their house has been adapted to meet their needs - they changed the door frames from 6ft to 8ft high and have customised the furniture			2
@entity11 and @entity120 plan to put their height to good use and are thinking of foraying in modelling			0
' we love being tall			0
i hear girls moan every day about their short height but we 're so content			0
we are studying right now but are also trying to build a portfolio			0
' we hope our height will help us get a long career as models , ' @entity11 said , adding that ' husbands are a long way away yet '			0
the @entity135 does not currently have a tallest family category , but would consider it @entity16 's tallest couple : mr @entity6 stands at 7ft 1.5in and his wife @entity8 at 6ft 2.6in both @entity12 and @entity91 want to be models and hope that their height could give them a huge advantage in the industry			1

family is so tall they never use public transport and ride scooters instead
@entity6 , 52 , is 7ft 1.5ins tall and his wife @entity8 , 46 , is 6ft 2.6ins tall
their daughters are both over 6ft and want to be models
