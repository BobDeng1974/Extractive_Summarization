by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:22 est , 26 february 2014 @entity4 's top court on wednesday scrapped a rule that political parties need at least three per cent of the vote to enter the @entity8 , opening the door to far - right and extremist organisations winning seats in a may 25 election			1
the government lowered the threshold to three per cent last year from five per cent , but the @entity15 ruled this was unconstitutional and abolished the hurdle altogether , saying it infringed parties ' right to equal opportunities			1
a group of small parties had asked the court to review the three per cent barrier , saying it was unfair and put off potential supporters			1
five of the judges on the panel of eight agreed , arguing that each voter must have the same right to determine the composition of the @entity8			1
there are fears changes to @entity8 voting in @entity4 could lead to extremist parties gaining seats			1
pictured , neo-nazis march through the streets of @entity37 during a protest in november , 2000 ' the three percent threshold is unconstitutional ... the deep infringement it made on equal electoral rights and equal opportunities was unjustifiable , ' the court said in its ruling			0
lawmakers from the @entity47 and the @entity8 had defended the hurdle arguing that without such a filter it would be harder for the chamber to function , but the judges said such fears were unfounded			1
the ruling has no bearing on national @entity4 elections where a five percent threshold applies , said justice minister @entity56			0
he said the court had argued that since the @entity8 did not form a government , giving each party a fair chance was even more important			1
in a previous ruling , the court said the @entity4 lower house of parliament has an absolute need for consensus and majorities in order to legislate , whereas this was not the case to the same extent with the @entity8			2
' the point of the threshold was to avoid any fragmenting of the @entity8			2
the parliament 's increased importance means it needs a stable majority , ' said @entity78 , head of the @entity79 ( @entity81 ) bloc in the @entity4 parliament			0
@entity4 will elect 96 lawmakers to the @entity8 , the largest national contingent			2
without the hurdle , a score of one per cent of the vote will be enough to secure a party a seat he said the ruling left major parties with a responsibility to make sure extremists and the far - right did not win seats			1
opinion polls have suggested @entity99 and fringe groups , including the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , could perform well in many countries in the @entity103 elections and potentially disrupt the mainstream political blocs			1
parties set to benefit without the hurdle include the anti-establishment @entity107 , the @entity108 , who advocate @entity111 - style referendums on policy issues , and the @entity113			2
' @entity117 representation of every single , valid vote is the core principle of democracy , " said @entity114 , chairperson of campaign group @entity115			0
the ruling means ' citizens ' votes for smaller political parties will be fully respected instead of being swept under the carpet ' , he added			0
@entity4 will elect 96 lawmakers to the @entity8 , the largest national contingent			2
without the hurdle , a score of one per cent of the vote will be enough to secure a party a seat under @entity4 's proportional representation system			0
the mainstream parties have long argued that electoral thresholds are needed to avoid political fragmentation in parliament of the kind that helped bring down the @entity138 and made way for the rise of @entity141			0
national voting systems for the @entity8 differ across the 28 member states			0
most countries , including @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and the @entity148 , have no threshold			0
eight nations have a five per cent threshold - the maximum allowed under @entity153 law - including the @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 .			0

parties no longer need three per cent of vote to enter @entity8
there are fears more far - right and extremist parties could join body
the move could also lead to more @entity99 groups gaining influence
