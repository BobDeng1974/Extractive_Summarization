by @entity0 , @entity1 they have taken very different routes to get there but @entity5 and @entity6 will meet in the semi-finals of the @entity8			1
@entity5 followed up his victory over @entity10 by thumping sixth seed @entity11 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 4 while @entity6 saw off @entity13 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 7/5 ) 6 - 4			1
the pair have known each other for more than a decade dating back to their days at @entity18 ’s academy in @entity19			1
meeting : @entity5 will meet @entity6 in the semi-finals of the @entity8 defeat : @entity5 beat sixth seed @entity11 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 4 both had obvious talent but , while this will be @entity6 ’s 15th semi-final from the last 16 grand slams , @entity5 will be playing in his first			1
had the 25 - year - old @entity25 followed his friend ’s advice , it might have been a very different story			1
' he was really professional already at that time , ' @entity5 recalled of their time together in @entity29			1
' i remember we had a friend , a @entity33 guy , who was all about the girls at that age already			2
he was looking good , putting on perfume , sunglasses , going to talk to the girls			2
' i see @entity6 , he ’s going to stretch			1
and @entity6 told me that , ‘ yeah , you can have anybody , you can have all the girls in the world			1
but to be really successful in tennis , you need to ( be professional ) ’			2
' i remember it still			2
that ’s a kid who is 15 years old			2
but i did n’t listen			2
' memories : @entity6 remembers @entity5 fondly from their time at @entity18 's academy in @entity19 @entity6 grinned as he remembered @entity5 as a teenager			1
he said : ' he was always somebody that was very enthusiastic about everything in life and you could see he wanted to enjoy it with open arms , if i can say that ( being ) politically correct			0
' he was always very talented			0
i remember he came out in the practices swinging fully through the ball			0
he did n’t really care too much			0
he respected the players that he liked			0
' the others , he just crushed on the court in practice and the tournaments as well			0
he always had this confidence about him that you could say that , even though he was 14 , 15 at the time , he was going to become something big			0
' @entity5 made the quarter - finals of the @entity8 in 2008 as a teenager and was already ranked in the top 100			1
but until this tournament he had made it past the second round at a grand slam just once since and in 2012 he dropped back out of the top 100			1
exit ; @entity6 beat @entity81 @entity13 7 - 5 7 - 6 6 - 4 that was the nadir and over the past 18 months he has climbed rapidly , reaching a career - high of 17th in the rankings , which could well become single figures after this tournament			1
@entity5 ’ resurgence has come under @entity90 coach @entity89 , who also looks after 20 - year - old rising star @entity91			1
@entity5 said of @entity89 : ' he did n’t deal with those kind of problems which my other coaches were dealing with three or four years ago			1
' i missed a practice once with @entity89 because i had a long night			0
i called him at 7am , and i said , " @entity97 , i can not come to practice "			0
' with other coaches , the first time when @entity103 came to @entity25 to prepare for @entity104 ; eight days of preparation , i missed five days of practice			2
' and then you evolve , you start to understand , okay , first , make one step			0
do n’t miss five days of practice			2
just miss three days of practice and then two days and then one and then nothing			2
' impressive : no 18 seed @entity5 has already beaten @entity10 and will be looking for another big scalp many players have a let down after a big win such as the @entity10 one , but @entity5 came out and played even better against @entity11			1
he said : ' today everything was good			0
i felt physically so good			0
i felt that i can run forever			0
i felt that he can not make a winner			0
if i feel so confident from the baseline , then everything just comes together			0
' @entity6 had a tougher time against @entity13 , who took a set off him in @entity125 last month , and was delighted to complete the victory in straight sets			1
' it ’s never smooth against @entity13 or against any server of his calibre , ” he said			1
“ there are few guys that are serving this well			0
' when he ’s on , it ’s very difficult to do anything except be mentally strong and consistent and try to wait for the opportunities			0
when they are presented , you better use them			0

@entity5 and @entity6 will meet in the semi-finals
@entity5 followed his won over @entity10 by beating @entity11
