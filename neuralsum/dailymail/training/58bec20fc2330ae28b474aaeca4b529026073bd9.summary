@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			0
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
@entity10 was @entity11 ? i 've no idea what has happened behind the scenes regarding @entity11 and @entity16			1
conversations must have taken place and decisions made about him not being a part of the national team because any manager would want his best 11 players on the pitch for the big games			0
no doubt there have been some difficult relationship issues behind the scenes			0
@entity30 - soacked : while @entity16 were being knocked out of the @entity31 , @entity11 was on holidays with his wife @entity33 missed : @entity11 played 78 times in an @entity16 shirt and would have been an asset again if available for @entity37 however , @entity11 was the best @entity39 centre back in the @entity41 last season , without a shadow of a doubt			1
he played practically every game in the league for @entity46 and went about his business quietly and @entity48 would ’ve been an absolute banker to be starting in the @entity16 team in every game we played in the @entity31			1
i 'm sure with mediation between the @entity56 , @entity57 and the captain @entity58 , problems could 've been sorted out			1
still the one : @entity11 was the best @entity39 centre back in the @entity41 last season down and out : despondent @entity16 captain @entity58 and coach @entity57 face the press on sunday of course @entity11 would 've had to respect the choice of leader but i 'm sure at the @entity31 he would have been adaptable and supportive and , more than anything , helpful for @entity58 in captaining our country			1
@entity11 's presence , authority , body language and karma in the big games would 've most definitely improved our team			2
now is the time to back @entity57 i sat watching @entity16 versus @entity76 at three o'clock in the morning in the chef 's kitchen on the only television at a yoga spa retreat in @entity81			1
the chef was watching it with me and we both had our @entity16 shirts on in a place in the jungle that you can only get to by boat			0
i actually thought @entity16 played well ; there was bound to be anxiety in what was the biggest game in a lot of those players ' careers			1
disappointment : @entity57 's @entity16 may have bowed out in the group , but the team did their country proud i sat with the chef disappointed and saddened but i still think the team put a shift in and had a real go			1
after visiting @entity102 as an @entity16 supporter in 2010 and watching @entity105 's team not turn up , and not do our country proud , i thought this was a very different performance			1
i 'm pleased younger players have been given an opportunity and i 'm pleased @entity57 has tried to get the team to play from the back and pass the ball more , which everybody has wanted for years			2
young guns : the likes of @entity118 ( left ) and @entity119 got a chance and did n't let @entity16 down now it 's time to back the manager 's judgment and let him lead the transition by bringing in more younger , fresher faces to play alongside those who have now got big tournament experience			1
@entity57 is a fine ambassador , you can tell that he has the respect of the players			0
it is disappointing but it is not , for me , all doom and dismay			0
@entity136 a chance yes , it 's a gamble			0
yes , i understand all @entity139 fans will be sceptical			0
but their new manager @entity140 is a good guy			2
he is honest , hard - working , very professional and he will get his team to play passing football out from the back and through midfield to attack			1
@entity140 has been my assistant three times at different clubs over the years so i 've witnessed his work first - hand			2
give him a go : @entity139 's new head coach @entity140 ( right ) is hard - working and professional of course , only time will tell if the appointment works			1
most managers nowadays are only lasting 14 months tops , so who is to say he is the wrong man for the job ? the last man in charge , @entity156 , got @entity158 into the @entity41 and for some reason the owner did n't think he was good enough			0
he brought through loads of good young players and hardly spent a pound note and still he was sacked			0
not enough : @entity156 ( left ) was sacked by new owner @entity164 ( right ) after doing little wrong i urge all @entity139 supporters to get behind the team , as , at the end of the day , it is the team that counts , not whoever the bloke is in the technical area			0
clubs are chopping and changing , and there is no doubt the old life in football management is well and truly mad			0
but give @entity140 a chance			2
my week ... i 've been in @entity81 on holiday and , as i mentioned earlier , went out to a luscious yoga spa retreat in the middle of nowhere			0
the evening after the @entity16 defeat to @entity76 i sat in the dining room with all the happy hippies and it did make me smile when a dude – and that is the only way to describe him – from @entity189 , with his body covered in tattoos , a goatee , a pony tail and dressed in what looked my granddad 's pyjamas , got his guitar out and started the evening 's entertainment with the theme tune of this place : puff the @entity201			2
i 've never seen so many happy teetotallers in all my life			0
it certainly helped take my mind off @entity16 's nightmare @entity31 .			1

@entity11 was the best @entity39 centre back in the @entity41 last season
whatever happened for him to be out of the @entity16 set - up could surely have been fixed with mediation from @entity57 and @entity58
@entity57 *deserves* to be backed after the way @entity16 played
@entity16 's young side did their country proud , unlike @entity105 's in 2010
@entity140 should be given a chance as @entity139 manager
former @entity223 boss is hard - working and very professional
