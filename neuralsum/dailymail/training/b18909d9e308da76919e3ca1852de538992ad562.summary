@entity0 , 39 , received a call from a business team manager at the bank to discuss his ' feedback ' after he was turned down for a loan			1
the call went straight to answerphone and the business manager left a polite message requesting he call her back			1
but the business bank manager then failed to hang up properly and , unaware the voicemail was still recording , immediately began joking with colleagues and mocking mr @entity0			1
she joked : ' @entity25 , i 'm glad he was n't there , ' cause he 's a k * * b. ' mr @entity0 , who declared himself bankrupt in 2009 due to the financial downturn , said he was ' shocked ' at the message			1
the freelance photographer said : ' i was appalled when i listened to the message			0
i could n't believe what i heard			0
' being rejected for a loan is one thing - but being subjected to a torrent of abuse by ignorant people , completely lacking in empathy and compassion for my situation , is quite another			0
' mr @entity0 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , declared himself bankrupt in january 2009 after falling into financial difficulties during the economic slump			1
after getting himself back on his feet , he contacted his local @entity3 branch in january to enquire about a Â£ 10,000 short - term business loan to enable him to buy a photography studio			1
his application was turned down and he was told that he had not been discharged long enough from bankruptcy			0
he did n't let the setback get to him and instead he began putting money aside each month in the hope that he could then fund his dream			0
two weeks ago , @entity3 got back in touch with him and asked him to fill out a customer satisfaction survey			2
mr @entity0 said he told the bank he felt they should consider giving loans to applicants whose bankruptcy had been fully discharged after five years			1
one week later , on june 22 , he was called back by the bank to discuss his feedback			2
it is believed the call was made by a worker at the @entity67 branch of the bank in @entity69 he did n't take the call but got a message on his voicemail from ' @entity73 ' , a @entity3 ' business specialist '			1
she said : ' yeah hi , a message for @entity0 , it 's @entity73 , the business specialist at the @entity3 in @entity67			1
' it 's just a quick courtesy call following your feedback on the 2nd of june with the monthly business banking survey			2
' if you could give us a call back and ask to speak to the @entity42 business team , thanks then , bye			0
' the caller then thought she had hung up and said to her colleagues : ' @entity25 , i 'm glad he was n't there , ' cause he 's a knob			0
' he 's complaining but it 's so clear			0
. no , no , he 's put on here ' as ex-bankrupt i do not get anything from you ' her colleagues are heard laughing in the background as she adds : ' start considering lending to ex-bankrupts are his comments			2
' @entity3 has apologised to mr @entity0 and says it is investigating the incident and the members of staff involved after listening to the abuse , furious mr @entity0 said : ' going bankrupt was an extremely difficult decision for me but , at the time , i did n't feel i had any other choice			1
' but the bankruptcy was completely discharged and , for the past five years , i have been trying to get back on my feet			0
' so to hear someone , who does n't know me , insulting and mocking me to colleagues was completely unjustified and demoralising			0
' @entity3 should train all their staff to understand the complexities of going bankrupt			2
it was the hardest thing i have ever done			0
' ' i 'm now considering closing my business bank account with @entity3			2
i 'm not prepared to give them my business when they obviously hold me in such low esteem			0
' a @entity3 spokesperson said : ' we apologise unreservedly to mr @entity0			1
' this is not the behaviour we expect from our people and we are currently investigating this incident , dealing directly with the members of staff involved			0
