by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 21 march 2013 a girl who was left scarred by a violent random attack on a night out could become the next miss @entity3 after her boyfriend convinced her to enter a beauty pageant			1
@entity7 , 24 , had her nose sliced almost in two in an unprovoked in @entity9 on @entity10			1
despite initially feeling ' so ugly ' she had to hide from her friends , she is now on course to become the next miss @entity3 after being crowned miss @entity12			1
' i was convinced to enter a beauty pageant after my the glassing left me with a scarred nose and i felt unattractive			1
it was to try and boost my confidence , ' said @entity7 , who is known as @entity20			1
' even after surgery i have been left with a little notch on my nose , but i have come to live with it			1
' bouncing back : @entity7 has made a remarkable recovery and has just been crowned miss @entity12 , boosting her bid to become the next @entity3 @entity20 , who works for a @entity28 company in @entity29 , @entity12 says : ' the doctors have offered me reconstructive surgery , but i have declined because i am happy the way i am now			1
' her nostril had to be surgically reattached after a group of men attacked her and her boyfriend in a bar on @entity10			1
@entity20 was glassed in the face on @entity10 2010 in @entity40 pub , @entity41 , @entity9 , when a thug struck her with a broken glass			1
scarred : @entity20 suffered terrible injuries during a night out in 2010 the then 21 - year - old was left with a 4cm laceration to her nose and a nose stud she had been wearing was left embedded in the wound along with a piece of glass - which was stuck so deep it could only be detected by x-ray			2
plastic surgeons worked for an hour to save her nose , reattaching her nostril with 12 stitches at @entity56			2
@entity20 - who had never previously thought of being a beauty queen or modeling - felt too deformed to even see her closest friends for three months after her injury			1
but her then boyfriend @entity60 , 25 , convinced her to pluck up courage and enter the local beauty pageant			1
' i did n't win first time , but i really enjoyed the contest and i felt more glamorous			2
' i 'm too short to be a model - i 'm 5 ' 5 " and you need to be at least 5 ' 7 " - but getting this far is a real honour			0
' recalling the night of the attack , @entity20 , whose father is @entity73 , said : ' this idiot in the pub swiped his arm across a table of bottles and glasses and i was hit in the face			2
' it felt like i had been punched in the face			2
my arm was covered in cuts from the glass and the next thing i knew my face was streaming with blood			0
' it was everywhere , and i was hysterical , screaming " he 's broken my nose , he 's broken my nose ! ' i could n't understand why there was so much blood			0
i knew i had n't been punched but there was so much blood , it was just gushing from my face			0
i was covered in it			0
' no one would tell me what had happened			0
people just kept saying , " do n't worry , it 'll heal , it 'll heal "			0
' it was only after the paramedics took me to @entity106 that my dad came and told me that my nose had been sliced open on one side , from the front right the way to the back			2
@entity20 says she turned to the beauty queen circuit in a bid to boost her self confidence after the attack @entity7 's case is still open as the attackers who glassed her have still not been caught ' they could n't operate on me that night and i had to go back the next day to have an operation under general anaesthetic			1
' they x-rayed me and said that there was a piece of glass still stuck in there , which they would have to remove and they had to cut out my nose stud which had become caught up in the flesh			0
' no one knows exactly what happened , but the doctors said that because of the way it was cut a glass probably hit me straight in the face and smashed on impact			0
" footage from @entity140 cameras at the club where the incident happened was not clear enough to identify @entity144 's attackers , who were kicked out by management immediately afterwards			0
no one took their details and the police had no evidence to go on , meaning her case remains open			0
@entity7 said : ' i had always dreamed of entering the competition because i am basically just a little girl deep down who loves dressing up and feeling like a princess			1
' winning miss @entity12 has not really sunk in yet			0
it was amazing , i was overwhelmed			0
' @entity20 needed 12 stitches to repair the damage and to remove a shard of glass			2
the eventual winner of miss @entity3 goes through to the @entity164 competition , which has a cash prize of Â£ 100,000 .			0
