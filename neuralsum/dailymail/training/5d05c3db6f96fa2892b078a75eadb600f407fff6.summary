@entity1 staff in @entity2 were forced to fill out a form to move an office printer to examine the possible effect it would have on different ' population groups ' including gipsies and asylum seekers @entity1 staff were forced to fill out a seven - page form just to move an office printer – to ensure that gays , gipsies and other minorities were not offended			1
in an illustration of the politically correct bureaucracy strangling the health service , staff had to consider the possible human rights implications of shifting the equipment			1
the ‘ ludicrous ’ form examined potential consequences for homeless people , gipsy travellers and asylum seekers – and even asked whether the move could encourage people to commit suicide			1
it comes at a time of growing crisis in the @entity1 , with some patients being denied life - saving drugs while others have to wait up to 24 hours in hospital @entity37 departments			2
@entity41 @entity40 msp @entity38 said : ‘ @entity42 does n’t even begin to sum up this incident			0
this level of waste and madness would never be tolerated in the private sector			0
' at a time when the @entity1 is supposed to be responsible with budgets , this is hardly a shining example of efficiency			0
’ the existence of the human rights forms came to light during a review of a proposal to site two printers instead of three on two floors at the @entity2 offices of quango @entity60			1
it listed 17 different ‘ population groups ’ such as transgender people , lesbians and the disabled , and asked how they could be ‘ affected differentially by the policy [ of moving the printer ] ’			1
even the potential effect on ‘ people involved in the criminal justice system ’ featured in the bizarre audit			0
among ten human rights issues explored were the right to a family life and to freedom of expression			1
an examination of the right to life under the @entity82 on human rights even asked if moving the printer could lead to suicide			1
unsurprisingly , the @entity86 concluded that in these cases there were no negative consequences			0
however , the review , undertaken by two members of staff , noted that there would be a ‘ general impact on all staff of making more queuing likely for the printer ’ but there could be a positive social impact as ‘ the people who do printing are more likely to meet and chat at the printers which do exist ’			2
in addition , staff members with mobility issues could ask ‘ teammates ’ for assistance if necessary			2
@entity60 describes itself as a ‘ national health board working with public , private and third sectors to reduce health inequalities and improve health ’			1
in 2007 , it emerged that it was setting up a £ 1million - a - year @entity111 to ensure lesbians , gays and immigrants were not discriminated against by the @entity1			2

@entity60 said it was ‘ committed to being a great place to work ’ ( file picture ) health campaigner dr @entity121 said : ‘ it sounds a little bit like bureaucracy taking over reason			2
anyone who has worked in an office knows all you want is a printer that actually works and does all that you require of it			0
’ a spokesman for campaign group @entity130 said : ‘ this is a ludicrous example of out - of - control bureaucracy			2
this assessment was written by a taxpayer - funded civil servant who surely must have something more useful to do			0
’ @entity60 said it was ‘ committed to being a great place to work ’ which aims ‘ to ensure all staff are treated fairly and consistently and with dignity and respect			1
’ a spokesman said : ‘ to help us do this and to comply with the @entity147 , we take time to impact assess new policies and practices			0
