@entity0 up against @entity1 is a mouthwatering prospect : one of the world ’s best strikers versus one of the game ’s best defenders			1
i watched @entity1 a lot at the @entity11 for @entity12 and he was immense			1
when he was missing , they lost 7 - 1 to @entity14 in the semi-final			0
@entity1 is an aggressive and brave defender who attacks the ball well			2
he ’s not the tallest at barely 6ft but that gives him extra mobility			0
@entity0 has been in formidable form for @entity20 since signing from @entity21 last summer @entity1 is one of the most respected defenders in world football and will try to stop @entity0 on tuesday @entity0 ( right ) will pose one of the toughest challenges that @entity1 has faced in a @entity27 shirt he ’s good on the ball and is not afraid to bring it out from the back			1
also , when opponents try to put pressure on him he will find a way out with a bit of skill			0
he makes it look easy			0
he is a threat in the opposing penalty area too but has n’t scored for @entity27 in @entity39 or @entity40 for more than a year so he will know that needs to improve			2
perhaps @entity1 ’s biggest weakness is the league he is playing in			2
@entity39 does not offer enough of a regular test for @entity27 ’s players so all of a sudden facing someone as brilliant as @entity0 could be a shock to the system			1
he and his central defensive partner @entity49 will want to show they are capable of stopping @entity20 , the competition ’s highest scorers so far			0
@entity49 ’s professional pride will have been wounded when @entity20 sold him so he also has a big point to prove			0
but he and @entity1 will leave space in behind as they like to bring the ball out , and that could give @entity20 opportunities			2
former @entity20 player @entity49 ( right ) is set to partner @entity1 in central defence for @entity27 @entity1 ( left ) has criticised the decision of @entity0 to switch nationalities from @entity12 to @entity63 @entity1 and @entity49 will also have to stifle the attacking threat of @entity65 ( left ) when they play @entity20 maybe they can get a hold of @entity0 but that might just leave space for @entity65 or @entity71 to run in behind			1
@entity0 can be the decoy			0
and as if the tactical battle is n’t enough , @entity0 switching nationality from @entity12 to @entity63 will add even more spice			1
@entity1 has already said he would n’t do the same and probably wondered how well @entity12 could have done in the @entity11 with @entity0 in their side			1
get ready for some niggles .			0

@entity0 is set to return to @entity20 *'s* line - up at @entity27
he will go directly up against @entity12 defender @entity1 in the game
the battle between the pair could hold the key to who wins the *clash*
