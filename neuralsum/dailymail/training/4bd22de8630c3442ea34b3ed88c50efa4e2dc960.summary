@entity0 sat in @entity2 ’s trophy room this week and made a statement that had echoes of his first day in june 2012			1
‘ what people probably do n’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club , ’ said @entity0 , attempting to explain @entity6 ’s poor form			1
‘ the weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players			0
once you adapt , you become clearer in your thinking			0
’ those words struck a chord with @entity18			2
as one of @entity6 ’s marquee summer signings , the £ 23million fee that brought him from @entity21 ensured there would be no gentle settling - in period			1
@entity18 , the £ 23m summer signing from @entity21 , has not made an immediate impact at @entity2 @entity18 agrees with @entity26 manager @entity0 that the @entity6 shirt can weigh heavily on new players the 26 - year - old came to @entity2 carrying an injury but looked fit when he came on against @entity31 last week the @entity32 expects big - money recruits to make an immediate mark and the fact @entity18 , having only just recovered from medial ligament damage , was rusty in his first couple of games against @entity40 and @entity41 , did not go unnoticed — most notably by the man himself			1
‘ it is something you ca n’t quite explain unless you have experienced it , ’ said @entity18 , 26			2
‘ there is that difference when you pull on a @entity6 shirt			2
’ slowly but surely , @entity18 seems to be finding his stride and he made a difference when coming on as a substitute against @entity31 and during the 120 minutes he played against @entity54 in the @entity55			1
the @entity6 jersey can also be a source of inspiration and that is something @entity18 intends to take into saturday ’s @entity62 derby			1
‘ it ( the expectancy ) is a great feeling , ’ he said			0
‘ you can see the relationship they ( the fans ) have with the players here and that is something i hope to build myself			0
the best way to overcome the expectation and pressure is to just try and enjoy your football			2
the former @entity21 man ( right ) also got through 120 minutes of action against @entity54 on tuesday ‘ not for one minute did i think it would be easy , coming to such a big club			2
you have to work twice as hard and that ’s what i am doing			0
i ’m sure the other signings are as well			0
‘ it ’s going to take a bit of adjusting , playing with new players , but i am 100 per cent confident we will be better for it			2
‘ we have had a tough spell but that brings everyone together			0
we ground out the result against @entity54 and we are going to have to show that side of ourselves at the minute but we will get there			0
‘ i never visualised it was going to be easy but i want to be tested and i want to do well			0
’ such was @entity18 ’s determination to make a positive impression that he stayed in @entity100 with the rest of @entity6 ’s touring squad rather than heading home for treatment after being injured during a training session			1
@entity18 made his name at @entity21 , who he helped establish as a strong @entity109 outfit @entity6 have lost their last two matches in the @entity109 and sit in 11th position the @entity26 host @entity112 on saturday , and will need to keep the likes of @entity115 quiet if they are to win a bigger way to impress , though , would be to shine in a game that still has the power to create heroes			1
nothing would kick - start @entity18 ’s @entity2 career than a winning goal against the team he followed as a boy			1
‘ @entity112 always seemed to be fighting relegation when i was supporting them , ’ says @entity18 , whose childhood hero was goalkeeper @entity126			1
‘ i did n’t go to see them a lot because of where we lived ( in @entity132 ) but i seem to remember there were a lot of tears			0
‘ i know they ’ve not won at @entity2 for 15 years and hopefully we can go on and get the win we need this time , too			1
my dad used to support @entity112 in the ( @entity141 ) @entity140 days , when they were doing well			2
so that ’s the reason i started following them			0
‘ playing for @entity21 , ( my affinity ) became less and less			1
but this is an appetising fixture , one for the fans			0
it would be a great game to give us that boost we need			0
how would i feel if i scored the winner ? i ca n’t quite answer that			0
it has to happen first ! ’ @entity18 was actually an @entity112 fan growing up and his favourite player was @entity126 ( centre )			1

@entity18 says playing for @entity6 brings *responsibility* and pressure
he is hoping it will also bring him inspiration for the clash with @entity112
@entity0 ' side host the @entity112 on saturday
@entity164 , a £ 23million signing from @entity21 this summer , has started his @entity2 career slowly
the *midfielder* is *aware* that a good *performance* against @entity6 *'s* arch - rivals will win over the supporters
