nature is more often a display of majestic beauty : imagine peacocks fanning their feathers in the sunlight , graceful cheetahs racing across the savannah and technicoloured fish basking in warm waters			1
but alongside these exquisite displays is a dark underworld of misfits – creatures so ugly and strange they have been described as the ‘ counterculture of the natural world			2
’ from the ‘ hipster toad ’ with a weaponised moustache to a ‘ werewolf mouse ’ who howls at the moon , these animals are the antidote to nature ’s show - offs			1
after killing the scorpion , the bat carries it back to a roost and eats it head - first			1
usually it eats the whole thing , including the stinger and poison gland now , some of the most bizarre examples of these creatures have been compiled in @entity45 ’s ‘ @entity46 and @entity47 of the @entity48 ’ publication			0
take , for instance , ‘ the hardest bat in the world			0
’ lurking in isolated patches of desert across @entity55 and the @entity56 , desert long - eared bats seem to be fearless			2
in one experiment a team of scientists from the @entity59 , @entity60 , caught eight bats and watched them hunt scorpions in their lab. the bats ignored dead prey , only attacking live ones that moved			2
they also showed an interest in boxes containing live scorpions , suggesting they were homing in on sound			0
@entity47 : on the left is a hipster toad that boasts a weaponised moustache and on the right is a unique turtle that urinates through its mouth the mouse that howls at the moon : in the dark expanses of the @entity84 in the @entity85 , a terrifying creature stalks the night , searching for fresh meat			1
anything will do : crickets , rodents , tarantulas – the nastier the better fish with its genitals on its head : the male fish , a @entity96 , his reproductive organs by his face			1
he weaves between drifting vegetation in the sluggish waters of a canal			0
he closes in on a female , swims alongside her and tries to mate when a bat landed on a scorpion , it immediately tried to bite the scorpion ’s head			2
once the scorpion was dead , the bat carried it back to a roost and ate it head - first			1
another oddity is the @entity115 horned lizard			1
to scare other creatures , it first turns side - on advertising both its length and the spines running down its body			1
if that ’s not enough , it inflates its body like a balloon and shows off the two horns on its head			1
as a last resort , the lizard will assault the predator by squirting a jet of blood out of its eyes			1
this extreme weapon confuses the predator allowing the crafty lizard to escape			2
@entity138 moustache toads , meanwhile , grow spines on their upper lip to spike rivals males			1
just like a human moustache is meant to signify masculinity , these toads display their upper lip with pride			1
the hipster toads can be found showing off their moustaches in @entity149 ’s @entity148 , @entity151 ’s @entity150 and @entity153 ’s @entity152			1
then there is the turtle that urinates through its mouth			1
when the @entity159 soft - shelled creatures need to urinate , it does so by sticking its heads into a puddle of water and wiggling its tongue			2
several years ago , scientists discovered that the turtles carry a gene that produces a specialised protein to help expel urine			0
however , this gene was expressed in their mouths , rather than their kidneys			0
horror lizard squirts tears of blood : if ever there was an animal that said ' do n't even think about eating me ' , it would be the @entity115 horned lizard			1
it has more defences than the @entity183 , ranging from camouflage to bony spines on its head			1
it can also squirt a jet of blood out of its eyes super-sensing sea cow : @entity196 ' hairs , it turns out , are like whiskers turning them into super-sensors			1
however , their sensitive hairs can only pick up objects within a few metres , which does n't stop them from being attacked by speeding boats bigger eyes than its brains : the eyes are the most distinctive thing about tarsiers , rivalling those of orangutans for size			2
a tarsier ’s eyes are truly enormous in proportion to the rest of the body , typically 1.5cm in diameter , whereas the entire tarsier is only 12cm long the male @entity219 emerald lizard has a blue head and green body which helps them blend into their background when viewed from above it 's the holy grail for @entity225 and @entity227 fans , but it seems a bright blue headed lizard has already developed its own invisibility cloak			1
biologists were baffled as to how male @entity219 emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring			0
while the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate , it should also make them easy for predators to spot			2
however , researchers from the @entity240 in @entity241 and the @entity242 of @entity243 , @entity244 , have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry @entity247 - their own cloaking device			2
they discovered that the lizards ' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from			0
when viewed from above , the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds			0
however , when viewed from ground level , the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate			2
dr @entity262 , a biologist at the @entity263 , say their findings are the first evidence of iridescent colours being used by animals to alter their visibility depending on viewing angle			0
he said : ' our results suggest that the blue heads are less striking for a bird above the lizard than a lizard in the same plane			2
birds see a less uv pure colour that is more whitish and less chromatically conspicuous when seeing the lizards from above			0
' but the @entity159 soft - shelled turtle is n’t as bizarre as the ‘ werewolf mouse ’			1
in the dark expanses of the @entity84 in the @entity85 , the creature stalks the night , searching for fresh meat			0
dubbed the southern grasshopper mouse , it has a habit of standing on its hind legs and letting out a dramatic , high - pitched howl once it has killed its prey			1
another creature to make the list of misfits is the male fish , a @entity96 , which is just 2cm ( 0.7 inches ) long			1
when attempting to mate with a female , a @entity298 cuulong swims alongside her , with his head is right next to the female ’s head			0
this might seem like a misguided tactic , but actually he ’s doing it right – because the fish ’s genital are on his head			1
the spotted salamander , meanwhile , have eggs that often contain single - celled green algae			0
biologists strongly suspect it is a symbiotic relationship			0
the embryos release waste which the algae feed on , while the algae photosynthesis and release oxygen			0
this makes it the first solar - powered vertebrate			0
these oddities of evolution have survived for millions of years , and in many cases they have been around far longer than humans have			0
they are also a treasure trove of information for scientists			0
in their genes they carry records of past evolution , of how life on @entity335 has changed over millions of years			0
they may not be as graceful as a gazelle or as beautiful as a hummingbird , but they are just as fascinating			0
first solar - powered vertebrate : the spotted salamander have eggs that often contain single - celled green algae			0
biologists strongly suspect it is a symbiotic relationship			0
the embryos release waste which the algae feed on , while the algae photosynthesis and release oxygen paradise with a twist : coconut crabs - also known as robber crabs for their habit of stealing food - is the largest arthropod to prowl the land @entity335 's biggest mouth with an erectile secret : bowhead whales sometimes swim with their mouths slightly open			1
this is for them to cool off as they have an organ in their mouths , bizarrely similar to a penis , which releases heat into the cold water			0

the ' misfits ' include the fish with genitals on its head and the lizard that urinates through its mouth
