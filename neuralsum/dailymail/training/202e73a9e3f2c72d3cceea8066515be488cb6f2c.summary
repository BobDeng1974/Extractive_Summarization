her work has already featured in two exhibitions and it is about to be displayed in a third , at a gallery in @entity16 next month			1
scroll down for the video @entity18 : @entity4 has earned more from her paintings at the age of five than most professional artists do in a lifetime global success : @entity4 's work has already featured in two exhibitions and it is about to be displayed in a third , at a gallery in @entity16 , next month painting since the tender age of two , @entity27 's cheapest works are selling for more than £ 3,000 each and it is estimated she has already made more than £ 100,000 from her art - more money than most professional artists earn in a lifetime			1
the money she earned so far has been put into a trust fund by her parents , @entity40 - born mother @entity39 and @entity7 father @entity41			0
@entity39 said she quickly realised her daughter 's approach and technique was different to other children play painting			2
she told @entity47 : ' her composition , her use of colour , her concentration span			0
' sometimes even as a little kid she was painting for about one hour , one - and - a - half hours , she would walk off , then come back again , it is just her concentration			0
' usually kids paint for two or three minutes and they have had enough , they run off , but not @entity4			1
' the youngster had her first solo show last year and next month her work will be exhibited again at the @entity59 in @entity16			1
composition , colour and concentration : @entity4 's mother said she quickly realised her daughter 's approach and technique was different to other children play painting on display : some of @entity4 's paintings - like these - have already been exhibited in @entity16 on display : some of @entity4 's paintings - like these - have already been exhibited in @entity16 some cynics have suggested the little girl 's work is influenced by her parents			1
however , to counter those claims , @entity4 's father @entity78 filmed his daughter painting a canvas from beginning to end and posted it on @entity84			1
the @entity6 prodigy 's paintings have already been compared to modern art greats like @entity88 and @entity89			0
the five - year - old 's proud dad said last year : ' she chooses the colours herself			0
she 's so determined , and forceful , and decisive , and she 'll actually get angry if you attempt to suggest a colour			0
' @entity4 began painting before she could walk at 11 - months old and now has her own space to create her artworks , mainly using acrylics on canvas			1
once her parents saw that she had a talent , they submitted her work to a local gallery , prompting the owner to arrange a special exhibition for her , unaware of her tender age - then only two years old			1

@entity78 added : ' @entity4 had a very , very difficult run			2
when her work was initially judged , it was purely on the painting itself			2
