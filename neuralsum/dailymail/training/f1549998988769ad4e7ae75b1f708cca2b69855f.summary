in the first major announcement , he called for a ban on doctors being hired in the @entity12 if they can not speak @entity2			1
but speaking on sunday he appeared unaware that two years ago the @entity33 announced new checks to be carried out on the language skills of medical staff			0
all @entity12 doctors have to pass a language test			2

in july last year it emerged that 43 per cent of doctors sanctioned by the @entity33 were from overseas almost everywhere he went in 2014 , mr @entity0 was seen with a pint @entity0 has given up drinking alcohol for january , he admitted			1
the @entity5 leader , who has built his reputation on being seen with a pint glass in his hand , wearily conceded that after a festive season of boozing : ' i need a break			1
' he plans to spend the rest of the month supping orange juice , but refused to give up his treasured cigarettes			0
almost everywhere he went in 2014 , mr @entity0 was seen with a pint , but now he has confessed that his body needs a respite from downing pints of ale			2
' i started before the new year , ' he told @entity71			0
' i am not being particularly virtuous about this			0
i just … i need a break			0
it does us all good to have a break every now and again			0
' asked if it was a total break from alcohol , he replied : ' oh yes , absolutely			0
but pressed on whether he has also given up smoking , he admitted defeat : ' oh no , i will think about that later in the year			0

but mr @entity0 insisted the problem continues , and voters were concerned about it			2
he told @entity71 's @entity97 programme : ' do n't we want to live in a country where we speak the same language ?

' i do n't know about you , whether you 've ever been to a gp that did n't speak very good @entity2 , and it 's something that people out there are talking about			1
' the whole point about immigration , whether it impacts on the health service or elsewhere , is that we have to have proper integration			0

asked whether he would sack non-english speakers in the @entity12 , the @entity5 leader said : ' if people do n't speak @entity2 and they are dealing with @entity2 - speaking patients then surely they should n't be employed in the first place			1
' mr @entity0 also said @entity5 would set out policies for saving money within the @entity12 , suggesting that middle management staff could be cut			1
but he acknowledged that overall health spending would have to rise to deal with @entity3 's ageing population			1
asked whether there is scope for savings within the @entity12 , mr @entity0 said : ' without any shadow of a doubt there is , although overall health spending is going to go up over the next few years because our population is rising so rapidly			2

' do n't tell me there are n't efficiencies that ca n't be made , there are			0
