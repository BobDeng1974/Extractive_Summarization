by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 16 january 2013 a new government survey suggests the number of people seeking emergency treatment after consuming energy drinks has doubled nationwide during the past four years , the same period in which the supercharged drink industry has surged in popularity in convenience stores , bars and on college campuses			1
from 2007 to 2011 , the government estimates the number of emergency room visits involving the neon - labeled beverages shot up from about 10,000 to more than 20,000			1
most of those cases involved teens or young adults , according to a survey of the nation 's hospitals released late last week by the @entity23			0
troubling spike : dr. @entity25 looks over a heart monitor display in the @entity27 at @entity28 in @entity29 after seeing a first - hand increase in energy - drink related cases the report does n't specify which symptoms brought people to the emergency room but calls energy drink consumption a ' rising public health problem ' that can cause insomnia , nervousness , headache , fast heartbeat and seizures that are severe enough to require emergency care			1
several emergency physicians said they had seen a clear uptick in the number of patients suffering from irregular heartbeats , anxiety and heart attacks who said they had recently downed an energy drink			1
more than half of the patients considered in the survey who wound up in the emergency room told doctors they had downed only energy drinks			1
in 2011 , about 42 percent of the cases involved energy drinks in combination with alcohol or drugs , such as the stimulants @entity67 or @entity69			2
' a lot of people do n't realize the strength of these things			0
i had someone come in recently who had drunk three energy drinks in an hour , which is the equivalent of 15 cups of coffee , ' said @entity81 , an emergency physician in the suburbs of @entity83 , who serves as a spokesman for the @entity86			1
suppliers : from 2007 to 2011 , the @entity89 government estimates the number of emergency room visits involving the energy drinks , a few brands shown , shot up from about 10,000 to more than 20,000 ' essentially he gave himself a stress test and thankfully he passed			1
but if he had a weak heart or suffered from coronary disease and did n't know it , this could have precipitated very bad things			0
' the findings came as concerns over energy drinks have intensified following reports last fall of 18 deaths possibly tied to the drinks — including a 14 - year - old @entity108 girl who died after drinking two large cans of monster energy drinks			2
@entity110 does not believe its products were responsible for the death			0
two senators are calling for the @entity114 to investigate safety concerns about energy drinks and their ingredients			2
the energy drink industry says its drinks are safe and there is no proof linking its products to the adverse reactions			1
late last year , the @entity114 asked the @entity89 @entity123 to update the figures its substance abuse research arm compiles about emergency room visits tied to energy drinks			1
the @entity23 's survey was based on responses it receives from about 230 hospitals each year , a representative sample of about 5 percent of emergency departments nationwide			0
the agency then uses those responses to estimate the number of energy drink - related emergency department visits nationwide			1
results : dr @entity140 is seen in his hospital days after a report called energy drink consumption a ' rising public health problem ' that can cause insomnia , nervousness , headache , fast heartbeat and seizures that are severe enough to require emergency care the more than 20,000 cases estimated for 2011 represent a small portion of the annual 136 million emergency room visits tracked by @entity155			1
the @entity114 said it was considering the findings and pressing for more details as it undertakes a broad review of the safety of energy drinks and related ingredients this spring			0
' we will examine this additional information ... as a part of our ongoing investigation into potential safety issues surrounding the use of energy - drink products , ' @entity114 spokeswoman @entity164 said in a statement			0
beverage manufacturers fired back at the survey , saying the statistics were misleading and taken out of context			0
' this report does not share information about the overall health of those who may have consumed energy drinks , or what symptoms brought them to the er in the first place , ' the @entity175 said in a statement			2
' there is no basis by which to understand the overall caffeine intake of any of these individuals — from all sources			0
' energy drinks remain a small part of the carbonated soft drinks market , representing only 3.3 percent of sales volume , according to the industry tracker @entity194			2
even as soda consumption has flagged in recent years , energy drinks sales are growing rapidly			0
ratio : the more than 20,000 energy drink - related emergency visits estimated for 2011 represent a small portion of the annual 136 million emergency room visits tracked by the @entity155 in 2011 , sales volume for energy drinks rose by almost 17 percent , with the top three companies — monster , @entity206 and @entity207 — each logging double - digit gains , @entity194 found			1
the drinks are often marketed at sporting events that are popular among younger people such as surfing and skateboarding			0
from 2007 to 2011 , the most recent year for which data was available , people from 18 to 25 were the most common age group seeking emergency treatment for energy drink - related reactions , the report found			1
' we were really concerned to find that in four years the number of emergency department visits almost doubled , and these drinks are largely marketed to younger people , ' said @entity224 , a senior statistical analyst with the @entity23 who worked on the report			2
emergency physician @entity25 said he had seen an increase in such cases at the @entity229 hospital where he works on the edge of @entity29 's @entity231			0
' i saw one young man who had mixed energy drinks with alcohol and we had to admit him to the hospital because he was so dehydrated he had renal failure , ' @entity140 said			0
