health chiefs have warned that an @entity2 black hole means patients may have to start paying for services - days after @entity5 said the health service must spend its budget more wisely a multi billion - pound black hole in @entity2 finances means that patients will have to get used to either being charged for treatment or paying increased taxes , health chiefs have warned			1
in a stark analysis of the dangers facing the @entity16 , the leaders of medical royal colleges and patients groups said it was ‘ creaking at the seams ’ and can not carry on as it is			2
the funding crisis is so dire that , in future , trusts may have to consider charging for gp appointments and asking patients to contribute towards the cost of drugs			1
the warning comes just days after a health minister admitted that by the end of the decade , the @entity2 will face a funding gap of £ 30billion a year – with ‘ dire ’ consequences for patients			1
the @entity36 revealed on saturday that @entity5 had told an audience of @entity38 last month that ‘ absolutely vital services ’ will have to be cut if the @entity16 does not spend its £ 100billion - a - year budget more efficiently			0
shortages are already beginning to affect the @entity2 , with some patients being denied cancer drugs and longer waiting lists for @entity45 and cancer treatment			1
the @entity16 also needs 3,000 more midwives			0
yet despite this , the @entity2 has found tens of millions to spend on cosmetic surgery such as facelifts , nose jobs , liposuction and breast augmentation			1
every week there are now 164 taxpayer - funded nose jobs , 37 liposuction procedures , 22 facelifts and 273 breast enlargements being carried out on the cash - strapped @entity16			0

‘ the status quo is not an option , ’ they wrote			0
‘ we are already seeing the signs of the system creaking at the seams			0
‘ all financial options are difficult politically ; higher tax spend , co-payments or changes to what is available			0
’ patients have been warned that they face paying for drugs or @entity87 ' appointments if the funding gap can not be closed the nine signatories called for more to be done to improve the efficiency of the @entity2 and address the ‘ budget crisis ’ affecting it as people enjoy longer life expectancies			1
‘ more must be done by us all to eliminate inefficiencies and wasteful variation in care , and apply technology to transform care delivery , ’ the letter said			2
‘ resources and vigorous service reform must go hand - in - hand			2
business as usual wo n’t do			0
’ they call for an ‘ honest , open dialogue ’ on the issue , adding that unpopular moves – such as hospital closures – may need to be considered			0
‘ we need a new settlement ; a fundamental , holistic agreement with the country on what health and social care should be , how and where it is delivered to maximise the quality of care , and how it should be paid for , ’ the letter said			1
‘ we believe the route is an all - party - mandated , independently conducted “ national conversation ” on the scope , provision and funding of health and social care			1
’ the letter was also signed by sir @entity127 of the @entity128 on @entity129 , @entity130 of the @entity131 , dr @entity132 of the @entity133 , @entity134 of the @entity135 , @entity136 of @entity137 , @entity138 of @entity139			0

sir @entity127 said : ‘ it would require productivity gains greater than what was achieved during the @entity147 to bridge the gap , and the @entity2 has never been close to that			1
’ a @entity151 spokeswoman said : ‘ the @entity2 will remain free at the point of use			2
‘ we are already dealing with the challenge of a growing , ageing population by moving to a system geared towards prevention rather than just treatment by improving community care to keep people living healthier at home for longer			0
