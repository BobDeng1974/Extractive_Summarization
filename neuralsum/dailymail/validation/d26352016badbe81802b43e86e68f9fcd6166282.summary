' amid scenes of high emotion , an often incoherent @entity0 admitted drinking heavily and taking @entity11 , for which he has a prescription , in an attempt to deal with life since @entity1 was found , face down and unresponsive in her bathtub on january 31			1
swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by @entity30 comfort : @entity0 's supportive mother @entity17 was by @entity0 's side during the entire intervention blame game : @entity17 said her son ' can not take too much more of not being able to see @entity37			1

he 's dealing with it by drinking			2
i 've begged him to stop			0
i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt			0
' hugs : before he left for rehab , @entity0 and his mother embraced			1

@entity0 had agreed to meet with dr @entity30 believing that he was there to be interviewed			1
according to dr @entity30 : ' he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster			1
' instead , on learning of @entity0 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab			1

' he added : ' his life absolutely hangs in the balance			0
' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to @entity1 , 22 , ending up face down in her tub			1
just two days ago @entity1 's aunt , @entity93 , made a series of explosive @entity96 posts in which she alleged that the family had ' strong evidene of foul play ' relating to @entity0 's role in events			1
she posted : ' @entity0 is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family			2
moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' @entity93 made her claims in response to being invited onto dr @entity30 's show			1

' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that @entity0 has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived			2
and speaking to dr @entity30 , @entity0 insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them [ @entity132 and @entity1 ]			1
' railing against the decision by @entity1 's father , @entity134 , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at @entity138 's @entity137 , @entity0 said : ' my name will be the first she calls			1
' according to his mother , @entity17 , @entity0 can not forgive himself for his ' failure ' to revive @entity1			1
his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier			0
' i hate @entity134 ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father @entity134 , who has blocked him from seeing the 22 - year - old in the hospital ' are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. @entity30 asks about @entity0 's sobriety refuses to go : the 25 - year - old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help resigned : ultimately , @entity0 concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility then , on 11 february 2012 , it was @entity0 who tried to resuscitate @entity132 when she was found unresponsive in her bath - tub just hours before she was due to attend a @entity163 awards party			1
speaking to dr @entity30 , @entity17 said : ' @entity164 just continually expresses how much he has failed @entity132			1
' he administered @entity125 [ to @entity132 ] and he called me when he was standing over her body			0
he could n't understand why he could n't revive her			0
he said , " mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs			2
" @entity0 has now entered a rehab facility in @entity138			2
meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically - induced coma			1
it is now six weeks since @entity1 – @entity8 as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath - tub of the home she shared with @entity0 in @entity180 , @entity181			1
unlike @entity132 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating @entity1 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22 - year - old as a criminal investigation			2
while @entity1 fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with @entity0 , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged			1
in an interview with @entity194 a friend of the couple , @entity197 , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , @entity11 , pot and heroin substitute @entity203			2
sounding eerily similar to @entity1 's mother and father 's drug - dependent relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on			1
' @entity1 and @entity0 would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had			1
it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs			0
' there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed			2
there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice			0
she was always covered in cigarette burns			0
' their relationship was also very volatile			0
' when @entity132 died @entity0 was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control @entity8 to get access to the money			2
she 'd do whatever he told her			0
' he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her			0
they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around			0
' according to @entity197 : ' but @entity8 really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother			0
she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her			0
@entity0 knew this and took advantage of it			2
' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , @entity197 , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , @entity11 , pot and heroin substitute @entity203			2
