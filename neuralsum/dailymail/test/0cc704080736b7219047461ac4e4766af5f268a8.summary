listening to @entity1 could help to enhance the enjoyment of a fish and chip supper , psychologists have found			0
research suggests that certain types of music can bring out specific flavours - including sweet , salty and bitter - in a range of foods			1
the intensity of @entity11 , performed by @entity12 , is said to be the perfect accompaniment to dark mouse or coffee			0
meanwhile , the high - pitched piano in @entity18 's @entity17 in @entity19 can help emphasise the autumnal flavour of a pumpkin pudding			1
listening to the right sort of music , including the @entity1 ( pictured ) can enhance flavours in certain food and drink , researchers have found in the @entity30 restaurant in @entity31 , fish and chips ( pictured ) are served up to a backdrop of the @entity1 in @entity30 restaurant in @entity31 , fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the @entity1 , while in @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , scented meringue comes with a commentary describing @entity43 footballer @entity42 in action , a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert			1
the so - called digital seasoning also applies to wine , helping drinkers to enjoy their tipple by up to 15 per cent more , if served alongside the right music			1

@entity59 's @entity58 1 in d major particularly compliments @entity61 2004 , while @entity63 's @entity62 in d major should be played while drinking @entity65			2
professor @entity66 , a behavioral psychologist from @entity67 , told the @entity69 's @entity68 that taste is not as dominant as we might think in judging a meal and that our ears might subconsciously talk to our tastebuds			0
he said : ' music can not create taste or flavours that are not there in your mouth , but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind ... it 's kind of digital seasoning			1
' the deep tones of @entity12 ( pictured left ) singing @entity11 can enhance the bitterness in coffee and the intensity in a chocolate mousse ( pictured right ) mr @entity66 added that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes			0
he described sourness as ' high - pitched ' , meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality			1
he also said sweetness is associated with richer sounds , while bitterness is linked to deeper tones			0
he believes the sound associated with salty - which he has not yet pinned down - would be enhanced by a throbbing type of sound			1
' bitter , sweet , sour - we have those , ' says professor @entity66 , ' but salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound			2
' to carry out his research , mr @entity66 gives people two pieces of identical chocolate and asks them to each eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music			2
