@entity0 is on the way and tender plants are exhausted			0
it 's time to clear the wreckage and hunker down for winter			0
but this is not the end			0
the new gardening year starts now — if you want gorgeous beds and containers for @entity11 , you need to plant them as soon as possible			1
unlike summer planting , colour wo n't be instant , but that will make the flowers even more welcome when they do appear			0
if you visit a garden centre this weekend , you may be disappointed at the lack of colour , but do n't be put you off			0
tiptoe through the tulips : the spectacular spring display at @entity22 , @entity23 see if you can find forget - me - nots , wallflowers , spring daisies or primulas — all low - key now , but full of promise			1
bulbs look even less exciting , but there will be masses on sale , from tiny scillas to huge crown imperials			0
slow burners winter containers and beds are a slow burn			1
they look green and unexciting during the darkest months , but colour will appear gradually			0
wallflowers are brilliant for that			1
if planting them in pots with tulips , choose compact varieties such as @entity49 for larger beds , plant tall ones such as dark - red @entity52 or @entity54 mix. forget - me - nots are essential			1
if you allowed them to naturalise last year , there should be self - sown plants begging to be transplanted to your containers			1
they will create an intense blue mist in april and blend beautifully with tulips			0
modern ones can be garish , but older primulas , such as dark - leaved , lilac - flowered @entity68 , look wonderful in pots			1
@entity70 also thrive in containers , and flower from march to may			1
team them with grape hyacinths or tulips			0
bags of bulbs bulbs are the backbone of spring displays			1
you can use big ones such as hyacinths to make bold splashes of colour or dot little ones among other plants to extend the interest			0
though fine on their own , bulbs look better among leafy plants			0
and since they can be removed after blooming , you can plant for a succession of flowers from midwinter to may			2
snowdrops and varieties of @entity98 flower from early february and can precede crocuses or muscari			2
but tulips are the top bulbs for the spring climax			2
if they are to grow on their own , choose short - stemmed ones , such as tan orange @entity107 and double - flowered @entity109			1
team taller kinds — such as scarlet @entity113 , soft - pink @entity114 or two - tone @entity115 — with forget - me - nots or harmonising wallflowers			1
big daffodils may be too lanky for containers , but the compact narcissus varieties do magnificently			2
try pale yellow , late - flowering @entity122 with winter pansies , or dot white - and - lemon @entity125 among the primulas			1
bulbs are some of a gardener 's best purchases			0
after using them for bedding displays or containers , you can then replant them elsewhere in your garden			2
then , with no more effort , they 'll give you years of service			0
that surely makes them the best possible bargains among spring flowers .			2

if you want gorgeous beds for @entity11 , you need to plant as soon as possible
see if you can find forget - me - nots , wallflowers , spring daisies or primulas
for larger beds , plant tall ones such as dark - red @entity52
choose primroses carefully - modern ones can be garish
