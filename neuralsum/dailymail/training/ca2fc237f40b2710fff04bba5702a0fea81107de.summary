by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:23 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 05:18 est , 31 may 2013 chilling video from @entity3 reveals the moment a @entity6 immigrant planted a bomb near iconic @entity8 - hoping to kill dozens of revelers in september 2010			1
fortunately , the bomb was a fake , supplied to him by undercover @entity14 agents			1
however , authorities say that if it had been real , it would have made the @entity17 bombings look like a ' minor incident			1
' a federal judge on thursday sentenced @entity20 , a 25 - year - old @entity6 immigrant , to 23 years in prison for the planting what he believed was a paint can bomb wrapped in @entity25 and filled with shrapnel			1
caught : this is the moment @entity20 dropped a backpack , containing what he thought was a bomb that would level a city block , into a garbage can on a crowded @entity3 street @entity20 coldly carried the backpack from his car to the crowded street			1
he was being monitored the entire time by @entity14 agents ' let 's give the elephant in the room a name : it 's called the @entity17 , ' @entity44 district judge @entity43 said			1
' what would have happened had his bomb been real would have made @entity17 look like a minor incident			1
' indeed , @entity50 's plot has shades of the april 15 attack on the @entity17 in which three people died and dozens were injured and maimed when two pressure cooker bombs in backpacks were planted near the finish line			1
@entity20 , 25 , was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the attempted bomb attack @entity20 dropped a backpack containing the bomb in a trashcan near an ' l ' train stop in the bustling @entity65 neighborhood of @entity3 near the @entity67 ' stadium			1
@entity20 was told by undercover @entity14 agents , the prosecutor said , that it would destroy half the city block and kill dozens of people			1
minutes before the sentence was announced , @entity20 , a 25 - year - old one - time @entity3 baker and candy - store worker , apologized for what he 'd done in a five - minute statement			1
crying , he asked the judge if he could address his family and friends , and then turned to look at them on a nearby bench			0
' i am sorry for the actions that i made and the shame i brought on you , ' @entity20 said , struggling to keep his composure			2
' i promise i will become a better person ... and make it up to you			0
' his mother sobbed aloud and when @entity20 finished , she said in an audible voice to her son , ' i love you ! ' @entity43 said he accepted the defense depiction of @entity20 as a uniquely gullible youth and that an informant may have been eager to please his @entity14 handlers by leading him on – though the judge said that was no excuse for @entity20 's crime			1
during the hearing , prosecutors played secret video recordings of @entity20 during the sting in which he talks about killing people			2
he explains that one reason to stage the attack along bar - strewn @entity108 is that late - night revelers will be so drunk they would n't notice him dropping a bomb into the trash bin			2
in another chilling video shown in court , @entity20 smiles and hums a tune to himself on the night of saturday , september 18 , 2010 - moments before heading off to what he thought would be a major terrorist attack			1
' you feel good ? ' an undercover agent asks			0
' yeah , i 'm ( doing ) great man , ' @entity20 responds			2
in another video , @entity20 rambles incoherently about then - @entity3 mayor @entity124 and the need to overthrow him in a revolution			1
' when you see mr. @entity20 on these tapes , all you can think of is that – this guy is really out to lunch , ' @entity43 said before turning to look at @entity20			2
' i do n't know what was going through your mind – and maybe you did n't know either			0
' this is the bar near @entity8 that would have been directly in the blast of the bomb @entity20 planted prosecutors also played a surveillance video of @entity20 , wearing a black hoodie , dropping the device into a trash bin at about 12.20am on september 19 , 2010 – while people crowded the sidewalk and music blared from area bars			1
@entity14 agents arrested him moments later			1
as part of an agreement with the government , @entity20 pleaded guilty last year to two explosives counts			2
in return , he faced a sentencing range of 20 to 30 years , rather than a maximum term of life in prison			0
one of @entity20 's attorneys , @entity158 , argued in court thursday that the difference between two decades and three decades behind bars was enormous – and that a sentence of around 20 years would give @entity20 the chance to start a family , to go to school and see his parents as a free man again			0
after court adjourned , @entity20 appeared to express relief as he smiled and hugged his attorney			0
before thursday 's sentencing , @entity20 also apologized in a seven - page letter to @entity43			0
he also insisted he 's worked hard at becoming a better person , including by doing yoga in jail			0
the @entity177 - born @entity20 blamed his actions in part on childhood trauma living in @entity181 , @entity182			0
during civil strife there , @entity20 , then 11 , witnessed machete killings from an apartment balcony , he wrote			0
his family moved from @entity6 to the @entity44 in 2008			0
to dampen his lingering emotional pain , he wrote that he drank alcohol ' all day , every day ' for months before the would - be stadium attack in 2010			0
he favored whole bottles of @entity192 , he wrote			0
the bomb was planted in the shadow of the @entity67 ' @entity8 in a popular nighttime area the defense suggested investigators may have come close to entrapping @entity20 , arguing the informant egged @entity20 on to acquiesce to ever - more ominous - sounding plots			1
' ( the informant ) preyed on @entity20 's fantasies ... and agents helped make that fantasy come true , ' another of @entity20 's attorney 's , @entity200 , told the court thursday			2
' if left to his own devices , nobody would ever have heard of @entity208			0
' prone to boasting and eager to impress , @entity20 even made absurd claims he could make a gun out of two pieces of wood and a spring , and a bomb out of baking soda , @entity200 said			2
but so inept was @entity20 , he bought a backpack , walkie - talkies and some batteries agents asked him to buy and the @entity14 then incorporated it into the dud bomb fashioned at its lab in @entity221 , @entity222 , he added			1
prosecutors concede @entity20 did waffle about his plans , allegedly talking about profiting monetarily and then broaching the idea of poisoning @entity227 or assassinating @entity124			0
but prosecutors say @entity20 himself concluded that maximum damage could be inflicted by a blast next to the popular @entity232 , just steps from @entity8			0
' undercover agents also repeatedly asked @entity20 if he wanted to back out , telling him there would be no shame in doing so			2
but he repeatedly declined , saying he wanted to press ahead , ' @entity237 told the court thursday			0
' it was his understanding that in 15 minutes ( after placing the backpack in the bin ) , there would be death and carnage all over @entity108 , ' the prosecutor said .			0

@entity247 , 25 , believed the bomb he planted on a crowded @entity3 street in september 2010 would have destroyed a city block
@entity252 said attack would have made @entity17 bombing look like a ' minor incident '
@entity20 was given a fake bomb by undercover @entity14 agents
