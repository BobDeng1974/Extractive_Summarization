by @entity0 on a hot summer day , when the sun is at its highest and the mercury is rising , there 's nothing quite like taking a relaxing dip to cool down			0
it 's not too difficult to understand therefore why this bear was unable to resist the opportunity for a quick paddle after spotting a child 's pool while roaming gardens in the @entity15 region of @entity16			2
@entity17 told @entity18 that he started filming the scene after his three - year - old triplets spotted the bear relaxing in the pool in their garden on the @entity25 day			1

bear sightings are not all that uncommon in certain parts of @entity16			2
in march last year , @entity46 reported how @entity47 , of @entity48 , was at home when a baby bear let himself in through the dog flap			2
the bear was filmed getting out of the pool before it climbed over a fence and left the garden mr @entity47 , 25 , immediately grabbed his dog , ran upstairs and locked himself in his room - but not before he took a couple of snaps of the cute , but dangerous , animal , who had a friend waiting by the door			1
mr @entity47 told @entity64 : ' we are used to seeing bears outside of our home			0
they will come to our garden and backyard a lot , it is common in our city , and i 've gotten used to seeing them these past two years			0
' but when i saw them walk into our house , it was really scary and amusing at the same time			0
' when he was safe in his room , mr @entity47 said he called police who , once on the scene , found the uninvited guest had gotten bored and left to be with his companion .			0
