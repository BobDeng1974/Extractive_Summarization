she weaved the elaborate web of deceit to get revenge on ex-boyfriend @entity26 , 26 , after their 16 - month relationship ended			1
she dreamed up the hoax after former school friend @entity40 added her as a ‘ friend ’ on @entity4 to show the photos of her own daughter @entity43			1

you were , and are , always on my mind and i never cheated on you or wanted anyone else bar you			2
you find that kind of loyalty and love again ? well i doubt it to be honest			2
' the most amazing time that comes to mind would be the first time we drove to @entity106 and watched the sunset , made love and had fantastic cuddles			2
was bliss ! i 've got a confession - i thought it would be the place you would ask me to marry you			2

we are satisfied she copied photos of the child from @entity4			0
' the behaviour did not occur during school hours and did not affect pupils			0
however the conduct could not be described as an isolated incident			0
' this was serious misconduct which took place over a prolonged period of time and involved deception			0
' @entity15 , who was not at today 's hearing , admitted taking the photographs from @entity4 but denied unacceptable professional conduct			1
the cruel hoax only came to light when proud ' dad ' @entity26 showed one of the baby pictures to a friend - who is also knew @entity43 's real mother			1
@entity40 told the police but after an investigation officers ruled the teacher had not broken the law			0

i remember she came to my 14th birthday party			0
' she had access to my @entity4 site as a friend but i have n't seen her for six years			0

she told me : ' he dumped me so i wanted to get my own back and hurt him			0
so i told him i was pregnant because it was the only way i could get back and hurt him			0
' ' i was crying so much i could barely talk to the police			0
her ex , @entity26 , arrived at the police station and he was just devastated too			0
i 'd never met him before but he said : " i 'm so sorry "			0
' even though they were not together as a couple he was over the moon about having a daughter			0
he told me @entity179 sent him hundreds of emails talking about their twins @entity30 and @entity31			0
' @entity179 sent him one email saying she was coming to @entity209 from @entity20 later this month and invited him to see their daughter for the first time at her hotel			1
' some of the pictures of @entity45 she sent him also showed me and my partner @entity216			0
@entity179 had told @entity217 was her best friend			0
' but the thing that got to me most were the plans for @entity26 to see the baby in @entity209			1
i 'm too scared to go out or even open the door in case somebody grabs the baby			1
' the police told me what @entity179 did may be morally wrong but there was no law against it			0
