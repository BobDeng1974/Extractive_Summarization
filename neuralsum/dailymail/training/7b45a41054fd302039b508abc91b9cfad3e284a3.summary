but that 's exactly what happened when @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 , stumbled upon what he thought was an empty house , only to find it was occupied with wild , woodland animals			2
mr @entity9 was visiting his family 's summer house in rural @entity19 , @entity11 , when he came across a series of derelict houses near his own			1
after taking a peek through one of the broken windows , he noticed tiny tracks across the dust scattered wooden floorboards			0
the house is occupied by woodland creatures who presumably moved in after the previous owners either relocated or died the amateur photographer was able to take pictures of the timid animals after he stumbled upon their dwelling while taking a walk the house in rural @entity19 , @entity11 , is the perfect shelter for the animals who have left tracks all over its dust scattered floors the 48 - year - old quickly realised that mice , badgers and foxes were among the many woodland creatures that had made themselves at home in the empty dwellings			1
mr @entity53 , who manages properties for a parish in @entity10 said : ' when i go into these houses , it ’s like stepping back in time — the past lingers in the corners '			0
he told @entity62 : ' there 's consolidation in the idea that nature is reclaiming the places it has lent to people '			0
welcome : a tiny field vole is observed by a puppy on the outside who perhaps wants to join in the fun home is where the heart is : the various animals seem to be getting along well living together in the empty house which has been derelict for some time a pair of badgers realise they 're being watched by mr @entity9 's camera lens			2
the aspiring photographer was glad to see the house being returned to nature room mates : squirrel look content in their surroundings in this candid moment captured by my @entity9 who said visiting the houses is like stepping back in time after taking a peek through one of the broken windows @entity9 noticed tiny tracks across the dust scattered wooden floorboards playing house : mr @entity9 said he was drawn to the area because of its sense of dereliction			1
he did n't quite expect to see the house so busy mr @entity9 said he felt as though the past ' lingered in the corner ' when he visited the house , much like this tiny mouse who he found there			0
