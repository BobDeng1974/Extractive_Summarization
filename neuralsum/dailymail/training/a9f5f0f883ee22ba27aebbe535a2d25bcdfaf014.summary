children educated at private schools earn almost £ 200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system , a new study has revealed			1
researchers said they had identified the scale of the private school salary ‘ premium ’ for the first time			2
even after taking into account the ability and family background of pupils , private school pupils earn ‘ substantially more ’ – nearly £ 58,000 by their early forties			1
the study by the @entity18 think - tank found that private schools tend to be more effective at improving pupils ’ results and sending them to university			1
children educated at private schools earn almost £ 200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system , a new study has revealed the findings prompted calls for leading fee - paying schools to be opened up to all pupils – regardless of their family wealth - using public money			1
@entity33 , @entity18 director , said : ‘ take two people of the same ability at age 11 and with the same parental background , track them forward , and the pupil who attends independent school is likely to earn substantially more – a total of £ 58,000 more on average just between the ages of 26 and 42			1
‘ our research suggests that a significant driver appears to be that independent schools typically progress the education of pupils more during their school years than state schools			2
‘ on this basis , limiting the opportunity to attend independent schools to those who are able to afford the high fees seems inequitable			0
’ the research tracked thousands of @entity55 born in 1970 and analysed their earnings between the ages of 26 and 42 – the age group it is currently possible to study			2
it found that pupils who attended fee - paying secondary schools earned an extra £ 193,700 between those ages compared with their state - educated peers			1
after taking into account test scores at age 10 and a child ’s family background , the premium dropped to £ 57,653			0
but the report said : ‘ even once family background and early age test scores are taken into account , those who go to independent schools are more likely to achieve higher salaries in later life , indicating a strong “ school effect ”			2
’ the research suggests that private school pupils go on to earn £ 3,600 - a - year more than pupils of the same ability and family background who go through the state system			1
over the course of an entire working life , the premium could exceed £ 150,000			0
fees for secondary day schools are typically £ 12,500 - a - year			2
researchers said they had identified the scale of the private school salary ' premium ' for the first time			0
even after taking into account the ability and family background of pupils , private school pupils earn ' substantially more ' - nearly £ 58,000 by their early forties the report suggested the difference between private and state school earnings diminishes further among pupils who go on to gain university degrees			1
but it added : ‘ having been to an independent school does increase later - life earnings above and beyond the fact that it increases the likelihood of achieving a degree			0
’ it said : ‘ independent school pupils with a degree earned on average about 20 per cent more than their degree - holding state school educated counterparts by age 42			1
’ the report said that teachers in private schools tended to be better qualified and class sizes were smaller			1
they were also better resourced and enjoyed greater freedom from the state			0
an analysis of exam results suggested that pupils at independent schools progressed more quickly than similar pupils at state schools			1
‘ an independent school premium does exist , ’ said the report			0
‘ some of this is due to the quality of the student intake , but our analysis has shown that a meaningful proportion is likely due to the learning environment provided by the schools			0
’ the report went on to back a scheme proposed by the @entity142 , a social mobility charity , which would involve opening up dozens of top independent schools to pupils of all backgrounds			1
participating private schools would receive the same funding per pupil as local state schools but would also be able to charge fees on a means - tested basis , with the poorest families paying nothing			1
extending the scheme to 100 leading schools would cost £ 215million , the report concluded			2
but the plan has found little favour with the @entity160 and @entity161 front benches			0
education secretary @entity162 has said his focus is on improving state schools			2
sir @entity165 , chair of the @entity142 , said private schools should be ‘ ladders of opportunity ’ rather than ‘ bastions of privilege ’			1
in a foreword to the report , sir @entity165 said the ‘ stark truth ’ was that a day pupil at a private school is 55 times more likely to win a place at @entity177 or @entity178 and 22 times more likely to go to a top - ranked university than a state educated child			1
‘ this is a shocking waste of potential , ’ he said			0
‘ this report clearly sets out the advantages that can be gained from a good private education			0
we need to open those opportunities to more young people , transforming the independent sector to ensure that successful day schools recruit once again on merit rather than money			0
‘ forty years ago , most of the best independent day schools in this country were open to children of all backgrounds			0
today , unless your parents can find £ 12,500 a year after tax , access is by and large denied			0
’ backing the report , @entity160 mp @entity204 said : ‘ the evidence is overwhelming that independent schools confer a massive advantage on their pupils			2
‘ rather than knocking independent schools down , we should be opening them up on a meritocratic basis			0
if we ’re serious about establishing ladders of opportunity for the bright kid from the council estate or rural backwater , this is the way to do it			0
