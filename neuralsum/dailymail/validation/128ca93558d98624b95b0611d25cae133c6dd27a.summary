@entity0 suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the @entity2 to govern alone would allow the @entity3 to prop up a minority @entity5 administration @entity0 has threatened to bring down a @entity2 minority government , even if @entity8 wins more seats than @entity10			1
the former @entity12 first minister said the @entity3 would vote down a @entity15 @entity14 's speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election			1
latest polls suggest the @entity3 will gain dozens of seats in @entity12 , depriving @entity5 of a majority and able to call the shots in @entity22			0
mr @entity0 suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the @entity2 to govern alone would allow the @entity3 to prop up a minority labour administration			0
the @entity15 said it was proof the @entity3 would ' sabotage the democratic will of the @entity28 people ' to install mr @entity10 in @entity29			1
speaking to the @entity31 magazine , mr @entity0 said the @entity3 could enter a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement with @entity5 - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities			1
but he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote - by - vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by @entity47 to introduce ' progressive tax measures '			0
with opinion polls suggesting the @entity3 are headed for dozens of gains from @entity5 and the @entity51 north of the border , mr @entity0 - who is standing in the @entity55 seat being vacated by veteran @entity51 sir @entity56 - would say only that he expects the party to win ' a barrel - load ' of seats at @entity22			2
he predicted that @entity51 would not be ' a big factor ' in negotiations on forming the new government , as ' if the @entity65 are reduced to half their mps the last thing they 're going to be doing is going into a coalition '			0
' the surviving half will want to survive , ' he said			0
this would mean the @entity3 , unionist parties from @entity70 and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome			0
mr @entity0 rejected @entity5 's argument that the party with the most seats after the may 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government , insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the @entity83			1
' the @entity15 would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the @entity86 , although it could be otherwise , of course , and we 'd be voting against , ' said mr @entity0			2
' so if @entity5 joins us in that pledge , then that 's @entity8 locked out			2
and then under the ( @entity92 ) @entity91 that the @entity22 parliament 's passed but nobody seems to have read , you 'd then have a two - week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people 's only chance to form another government			2
' the @entity3 would act to prop up a @entity5 government with @entity10 in @entity103 , even if @entity8 wins more seats although mr @entity8 would remain incumbent prime minister until a new government was formed , the @entity91 - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result , said mr @entity0			1
the former @entity3 leader said he had ' no idea ' whether a @entity5 government emerging from such a process would have mr @entity10 as its leader , and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the @entity3 so firmly ' if i were him , i would n't have ruled it out , ' said mr @entity0			1
' @entity120 ( @entity121 , the @entity3 leader ) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely			2
but she did n't rule it out : she said it was highly unlikely ... it 's still highly unlikely			0
' asked what he saw as the probable outcome , mr @entity0 said : ' i think probable would be vote - by - vote ( support for @entity5 ) , and possible would be confidence and supply			0
' a new poll of voters in @entity12 this week put @entity5 down to just 27 per cent , which professor @entity134 says could leave the party with just two mps , the same number as the @entity15 mr @entity0 said it was ' bad politics ' for mr @entity8 to float the prospect of @entity141 votes for @entity141 laws on the morning after last year 's independence referendum and said it was now ' not a question of if , but when ' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the @entity28 would take place			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' @entity0 has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the @entity28 people in order to make @entity10 prime minister			1
' that would mean chaos for @entity28 , with weak @entity10 dancing to @entity0 's tune			0
the only way to protect @entity158 , keep @entity28 together and safeguard the economy is to vote @entity2			0

@entity162 leader says he would lead *revolt* against a @entity15 queen 's speech
@entity8 would have first shot at forming a government after the election
but if *legislation* is rejected in the @entity5 would have a chance
@entity0 suggests @entity3 would not *opt* for full - blown coalition with @entity5
tories say he would ' sabotage the democratic will of the @entity28 people '
