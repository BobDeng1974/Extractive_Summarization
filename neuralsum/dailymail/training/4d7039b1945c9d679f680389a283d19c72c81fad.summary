by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:08 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 26 february 2013 a miniature satellite carrying a smartphone has been launched into space			1
the @entity6 - built @entity5 , developed by scientists in @entity8 , was sent into orbit from @entity10 in @entity11			1
known as ' phonesat ' , the device is the first off - the - shelf smartphone to be sent out of the earth 's atmosphere , where it will orbit the planet in synchronisation with the sun at 488 miles ( 785km )			2
you 'd expect to see an @entity21 in space ... a @entity6 team is set to launch the first satellite controlled by a smartphone			1
the @entity27 satellite will be controlled by a @entity28 during part of its space mission scientists from the @entity8 's @entity33 ( @entity34 ) and @entity35 ( @entity35 ) are testing how gadgets that are available on the high street can perform in space			1
the @entity40 android smartphone has been loaded with special experimental apps and will act as the ' brain of the satellite '			1
@entity11 @entity45 ( @entity46 ) @entity47 , @entity47 - c 20 lifts off from @entity10 in @entity48 carrying the smartphone satellite professor sir @entity50 , @entity34 director and also executive chairman of @entity35 , said : " this mission is a fantastic achievement and a great tribute to the hard work of the engineers involved			1
' the @entity6 's first nanosatellite @entity58 , also built by @entity34 and @entity35 and launched in 2000 , was the world 's most advanced nanosatellite at the time - @entity27 continues that story with the latest technologies available to us in 2013			1
' the smartphones that many people carry around in their pockets contain the highly advanced technologies that are integral to satellites - such as cameras , radio links , accelerometers and high performance computer processors			2
experts said they have almost everything needed to operate a satellite - except the solar panels and propulsion			1
the @entity40 has been tested to work in a vacuum and at temperatures as low as minus @entity79 and as high as @entity80			1
its apps were chosen from entries to a @entity85 competition , one of which tests whether a ' scream in @entity45 ' can be heard through vibrations in the phone 's microphone			0
developed by @entity93 , it makes use of several screams that were submitted by visitors to the project 's website			0
alien , starring @entity99 , had the tagline : ' in space no - one can hear you scream ' at various points , the app will play videos of the screams and monitor if the phone 's onboard speaker picks up the noise			2
also fitted on the 3.9in ( 10cm ) x 11.8in ( 30cm ) satellite - which weighs 9.5lbs ( 4.3kg ) - is a new @entity113 - based high - speed processor , an orbit control system and two water - alcohol fuelled plasma thrusters			1
the smartphone is pressed up against a side panel of the 30cm - long , 4.3kg cubesat , so that it 's @entity121 camera can look out and take pictures of the @entity123 and the @entity124			2
world first : the @entity27 cubesat during final assembly and test phase december 2012			1
the camera on its @entity28 ' heart ' is visible through the porthole at the top of the stack the @entity27 ( which stands for @entity133 and @entity134 ) is a joint project between @entity33 and @entity136 , a world leader in small commercial spacecraft			1
modern smartphones contain advanced technologies and incorporate several key features that are essential to satellites like cameras , radio links , accelerometers and high performance computer processors			0
add in solar panels and propulsion systems and that 's almost everything a spacecraft needs to fly			1
during the first phase of the mission , @entity27 will use a number of experimental ' apps ' to collect data whilst a new high - speed linux - based @entity158 computer developed by @entity34 takes care of the satellite			1
in phase two , the @entity27 team plan to switch the satellite 's in - orbit operations to the smartphone , thereby testing the capabilities of a number of standard smartphone components for a space environment			1
the @entity6 built strand - 1 spacecraft in a vacuum chamber			2
the miniature satellite which is carrying a smartphone , has been launched into space schematic : this graphic shows the various parts of the @entity27 during the summer of 2011 , the @entity27 team ran a @entity85 competition to find apps to be loaded onto the satellite 's @entity40 smartphone prior to its launch			1
the winners are : @entity187 , which will record the magnitude of the magnetic field around the phone during orbit			0
used as a precursor to further scientific studies , such as detecting @entity197 waves ( magnetic oscillations in our upper atmosphere ) , the @entity193 app could provide proof of principle			0
the @entity204 app , which will show satellite telemetry on the smartphone 's display which can be imaged by an additional camera on - board			2
this will enable new graphical telemetry to interpret trends			0
postcards from @entity45 and 360 are joint winners , using an app that will take images using the smartphone 's camera and use the technology onboard the spacecraft to establish @entity27 's position			2
the public will be able to request their own unique satellite image of @entity123 through a website , where images can be seen on a map showing where they have been acquired			0
the scream in @entity45 app will make full use of the smartphone 's speakers			0
testing the theory ' in space no - one can hear you scream , made popular in the 1979 film ' @entity240 ' , the app will allow the public to upload videos of themselves screaming in a creative way to an allocated website			0
the most popular videos will be played on the phone while in orbit and the scream recorded using the smartphone 's microphone			0
dr @entity251 added : ' a smartphone on a satellite like this has never been launched before but our tests have been pretty thorough , subjecting the phone to oven and freezer temperatures , to a vacuum and blasting it with radiation			2
' it has a good chance of working as it should , but you can never make true design evolutions or foster innovation without taking a few risks			0
@entity27 is cool because it allows us to do just that			2
' the satellite will be commissioned and operated from the @entity33 's ground station at the @entity8			0
being the first smartphone satellite in orbit is just one of many ' firsts ' that @entity27 is hoping to achieve			1
another important mission is the testing of two new propulsion technologies			0
the first , known as the @entity281 - jet @entity280 ( which benefits from the grand acronym @entity282 ) , will use the ejection of a water alcohol mixture to provide thrust			0
the second is its @entity287 that use an electric current to heat and ablate a material to produce a charged gas which can then be accelerated by a magnetic field to push the cubesat along			0
although both propulsion systems produce only tiny amounts of thrust they interesting for their fuel efficiency			1
@entity297 , head of science for @entity35 , said : ' we 've deliberately asked this enthusiastic and talented young team to do something very non-standard in terms of the timescales , processes and the technologies used to put the satellite together because we want to maximise what we learn from this research programme			0
' i ca n't wait to see what happens next			0
' @entity311 is already in development .			0

@entity27 launched from @entity10 , @entity11
it is controlled by a @entity40 *handset* running @entity21
satellite will also test two new fuel - efficient propulsion systems
