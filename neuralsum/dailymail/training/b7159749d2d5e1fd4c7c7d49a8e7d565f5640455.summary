by @entity0 published : 23:40 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 6 december 2012 a tragic baby girl survived for just 15 hours following a catalogue of blunders by hospital staff which included an obstetrician ignoring three bleeps to his pager			1
a coroner ruled that mother @entity9 was ' badly let down ' by the @entity10 who missed opportunities that could have saved tragic daughter @entity13			1
dr @entity14 was alerted three times by the midwife team amid growing concerns for the expectant mother			2
the child was born at @entity20 in @entity21 but survived for just 15 hours after a catalogue of errors by staff he only arrived to review her at 4.05am after initially being called at 3.15am and gave no explanation for his delay , an inquest heard			2
mrs day gave birth to little @entity13 by caesarean section within the hour at 4.54am on december 9 , 2010 at @entity20			1
she weighed just 5.86lbs and was very cold			2
she was not feeding naturally from her mother and developed both hypoglycaemia and hypothermia			2
but a coroner said other staff also failed the mum as her condition did n't trigger alarm bells quickly enough and there was a delay in moving her to a special care unit			2
@entity45 dr @entity44 , a locum who had been at the hospital for just four days , told the inquest @entity13 appeared to be in ' good condition ' when he examined her			1
he said he was unaware of her low temperature , but had he been , would have admitted her to the special care baby unit			0
' as a result of this little girl 's death , it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in these circumstances in the future			0
the @entity10 is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud			1
' coroner @entity61 paediatrician registrar dr @entity62 was also said to be lacking ' basic skills ' to help when @entity13 went into the @entity66 at around 5pm			1
by that time her oxygen saturation levels were low			0
and a consultant paediatrician was held up in traffic and did not arrive at the hospital until 6.30pm - an hour after he was called			0
@entity13 died two hours later at 8.30pm and pathologists were unable to determine her cause of death			1
@entity61 , the assistant deputy @entity21 coroner , said hospital staff ' missed opportunities ' that might have saved the baby			1
he said he was referring the case to the @entity81 to investigate neo-natal care at the @entity83			0
recording a narrative verdict , mr. @entity61 said : ' she was not recognised as small for her gestational age and at high risk of hypothermia and hypoglycaemia - or that she had signs indicating she was unwell after delivery			0
' these would have warranted an early paediatric review and admission to the special care baby unit for monitoring and investigation			0
' this resulted in a lost opportunity to render further medical intervention			0
' as a result of this little girl 's death , it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in these circumstances in the future			0
' the @entity10 is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud			1
' but unfortunately , as is evident from the death of @entity13 , there are rare occasions when a person under the care of the @entity10 is badly let down			1
' mrs day , formerly of @entity117 , @entity21 , but now living in @entity118 , left the two - day hearing without comment .			0
