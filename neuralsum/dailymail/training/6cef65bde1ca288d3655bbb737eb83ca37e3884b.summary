by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 25 october 2013 a playground scrap saved a boy ’s life when it led doctors to discover a dangerous tumour wrapped around his spine			1
when @entity9 returned from nursery complaining of a tummy ache , his mother @entity8 put it down to bruising sustained in rough - and - tumble games with his friends			1
but at a check - up , it was revealed that @entity9 ’s pains were in fact a sign of aggressive neuroblastoma which , if left unchecked , could have become untreatable			1
@entity9 ( pictured this time last year ) , seven , was diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma after a playground scrap left him with a stomach ache on wednesday ms @entity24 , 32 , received the amazing news that , following an intensive course of treatment , seven - year - old @entity9 is now free of cancer			1
she said : ‘ were it not for the knock @entity9 received at nursery , things could have been very different			2
‘ neuroblastoma sometimes has flu - like symptoms but @entity9 gave none of the signs			1
it ’s often only diagnosed when it ’s in its late stages , when it ’s too late to do anything			0
‘ it was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined @entity9 when they did			1
’ when he returned from nursery school in october 2009 @entity9 , then aged three , rapidly deteriorated			1
ms @entity24 said : ‘ i dropped @entity9 off at school in the morning			2
at midday i got a call saying @entity9 had been thumped in the tummy while he was playing , as boys do			2
@entity9 has just been told he is cancer - free for the first time in four years but his parents are aware the disease could return at any time @entity9 ( pictured in hospital ) has to have further check - ups in january but his parents say they are currently just happy that he is okay for now ‘ but then @entity9 refused to eat and was in absolute agony			1
i took him to hospital , where they first thought the pain was caused by trapped wind			0
we were sent home , and i was told @entity9 would get better			2
‘ he only got worse			0
i took him back to hospital where they decided @entity9 had constipation			2
‘ two days later , he had a high temperature , extreme pain and , worryingly , he could n’t move his legs			0
@entity9 ( pictured at @entity72 in 2010 ) was diagnosed with cancer in october 2009 after doctors found a tumour wrapped around his spine during a check - up after a playground fight @entity9 ( pictured in november 2010 ) received treatment for the tumour in his back before doctors found more tumours in his chest which meant he required further surgery and chemotherapy ‘ i asked to speak a senior trauma doctor who requested an immediate mri scan			1
when he looked at the result the colour flushed from his face			0
‘ they told me and my ex-husband @entity92 , who is @entity9 ’s father , that we had better sit down			2
they had found a tumour wrapped around his spine			1
' we had to prepare for the worst			0
they said @entity9 could have less than two months to live , and he might not reach @entity72			1
’ @entity9 ( pictured with his mother , @entity8 ) was only given two months to live when he was first diagnosed in 2009 and doctors said he only had a five per cent chance of making a full recovery doctors estimated @entity9 had just a five per cent chance of making a full recovery			1
his devastated parents , who were living in @entity104 at the time , mustered all their strength to support their boy through a course of strong medication , followed by emergency surgery and a round of chemotherapy tablets			1
they were told @entity9 , who is a little brother to the couple ’s daughter @entity112 , 13 , had miraculously entered remission shortly before the family relocated to @entity116 in october 2010			1
but when they got to their new home in @entity121 , @entity122 , senior clinicians at the @entity118 in @entity119 discovered that @entity9 ’s situation was in fact graver than anyone realised			2
@entity9 's mother , @entity8 , said : ' were it not for the knock @entity9 received at nursery , things could have been very different			2
it was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined @entity9 when they did ' ‘ i had a feeling - a mother ’s intuition - that @entity9 was n’t in the clear , ’ said ms @entity24			1
‘ a professor at the hospital rang to tell me that they ’d found another tumour in his chest			1
‘ not only was @entity9 not in remission , he was in fact in worse shape that i ’d known			1
it was a terrible blow			0
’ @entity9 was put on a new regime which required him to brave three different types of chemotherapy treatments for five days at a time , every three weeks			1
he also received stem cell transplants			0
in 2011 he underwent more surgery to remove cancerous growths , including one which was wrapped around one of his ribs			2
ms @entity24 ( pictured with @entity9 ) said : ' we might have faced a worse - case scenario if we had n't caught @entity9 's illness early			1
in almost eight out of ten cases , neuroblastoma is n't diagnosed until it 's in the last stages ' the treatment exacted a heavy toll on @entity9 ’s body and , exhausted , he took a turn for the worse in early 2012			1
but by march that year the only tumour left in his body was a growth behind his heart			0
his chances of survival began to climb significantly and for the first time @entity9 ’s mother dared to dream that her son might pull through			1
on wednesday , ms @entity24 , a former estate agent , was given the wonderful news that the heart tumour no longer appeared on scans			0
she said : ‘ there ’s no evidence of the tumour any more			0
his blood test is fine			0
‘ he has a curvature of the spine and he has hearing and speech difficulties , but with therapy these challenges can be overcome			0
it ’s no surprise he ’s got some catching up to do - he ’s been in hospital so many times over the course his life			0
@entity9 ( pictured with his sister , @entity191 at @entity192 ) has been left with speech and hearing difficulties			2
he also now has a curved spine but he now has a chance of survival ‘ we have another test in january and we ’re aware that the cancer might come back at any time , but for the moment , we ’re so happy			1
‘ we might have faced a worse - case scenario if we had n’t caught @entity9 ’s illness early			1
in almost eight out of ten cases , neuroblastoma is n’t diagnosed until it ’s in the last stages			2
‘ if it was n’t for that punch to the tummy , we would never have known it was there			0
’ ms @entity24 paid tribute to the tireless efforts of the staff who brought @entity9 back from the brink			2
she said : ‘ chance played a part , but so did a lot of hard work and generosity			0
if it was n’t for the doctors and the people who donated blood and platelets , we would have lost @entity9			1
’ neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts			0
it usually starts in the child 's abdomen , often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys			0
it can then spread to other areas such as the bones , liver and skin			0
the cancer affects about 100 children in the @entity243 each year and is usually diagnosed in under - 5s			1
it is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours			2
the symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread			0
initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite			0
the most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child 's abdomen			0
other possible symptoms are a lump in the child 's neck , bone pain , weakness in the child 's lower body , anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin			0
because the early symptoms are vague , the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body			0
the outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing			0
it is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children			0

@entity9 developed stomach ache after a playground scrap in 2009
at a check - up doctors found a tumour wrapped around his spine
he was diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma and was given just two months to live - doctors said there was only a 5 *%* chance of recovery
he had surgery and chemotherapy and was thought to be in remission
but , more tumours were then found in his chest so he had more surgery and chemotherapy - this week he was finally declared cancer - free
his parents remain aware that the cancer could return at any time
