@entity0 looks unstoppable at the moment but is he the best in @entity4 history ? stats say he has a better goal ratio than anyone but he ’s not making the top of my list of @entity4 strikers			1
he ’s not far off though ... videos scroll down to watch @entity14 @entity13 his intelligence was what set him apart			1
i had some quite famous battles with him ! his runs were very clever , often standing in an offside position to get ahead of you , then the play would switch sides and you ’d have to catch up with him before the cross came in to him			1
he was an absolute nuisance			1
@entity32 was a nuisance at @entity34 and boasted a formidable goalscoring record 10 @entity36 the double in the 2001 fa cup final against us really hurt			1
he was like @entity41 , someone out of a comic who burst on to the scene and blew @entity46 away			1
if you gave him any space behind you , he was gone and he ’d score			1
he would have breezed past @entity51 ’s @entity50 record if not for injuries			1
he was never the same again after hamstring trouble relatively early in his career			1
@entity36 finds the net against @entity56 during a league game back in december 1999 at @entity58 9 @entity59 everyone talked about the famous @entity61 back four but @entity59 scored the goals that won the games			1
he was a showman and did n’t really enjoy tap - ins			1
he liked to vary his finishes , you could n’t guess where he was going to put it			2
i played against him too and he was determined and strong			2
@entity59 scores for @entity61 against @entity73 during a 4 - 0 thumping at @entity75 in april 1992 8 @entity76 he reminds me regularly of scoring the fastest @entity4 hat - trick — against me ! i think he is the most natural finisher i ’ve seen			1
scoring seemed so effortless , he ’d just guide the ball into the corner - he did n’t need to leather the ball			2
injuries stopped him from maintaining the same absurd levels he set early in his career			2
@entity76 scores against @entity87 during @entity73 's 4 - 3 win back in the 1996 - 97 season 7 @entity90 he could yet move up this list depending on the next few years			1
i like his determination and the fact he can score any type of goal			2
he could play in almost any position but i still like him sitting deeper			2
his record and trophy cabinet say it all			2
@entity90 scored this wonder goal against @entity103 at @entity104 in february 2011 @entity90 's breakthrough when at @entity106 and then at @entity34 was phenomenal 6 @entity107 the maestro			1
people did n’t realise how fast he was because he often played so deep			2
you could n’t catch him			2
he had such vision , balance , intelligence and skill			2
his right foot was like a hook			2
@entity117 learned so much from him			0
he was a perfectionist too , always looking for the perfect pass			0
everything he hit was so clean			0
the @entity121 brought a poise to the @entity123 which typified the style in which @entity125 wanted to play @entity107 - scorer of this memorable effort against @entity128 in 1997 - is no 6 on @entity130 's list @entity130 takes on @entity50 rugby star @entity131 in his predictions challenge - could you do any better ? 5 @entity134 i ’d have loved to have played against him			1
as a lone striker , he was as good as there has been			0
he could occupy both centre - halves with his movement			0
at a peak , he played on the shoulder and was so powerful			0
he was so much better than the rest that he still has a role now under @entity145			0
@entity134 ( pictured playing against @entity34 ) is now back at @entity145 's @entity147 4 @entity148 my @entity151 colleague did n’t score too many goals against me ! but he was prolific - lethal in front of goal			1
he hit the ball harder than anyone else and had supreme confidence in his striking ability			0
he was n’t big but had an excellent spring and used his body well to score so many headers			0
you had to be so tight to him or he ’d bury the ball			0
former @entity87 striker @entity148 has scored more goals than anybody else in the @entity4 @entity148 netted for @entity87 , @entity167 and @entity168 - always celebrating the same way 3 @entity0 if he does n’t get away from someone first time , he ’ll just stop and then try again with a little swivel and drop of the shoulder			1
then it ’s in the back of the net			0
everything ’s very controlled and he ’s one of the few who does n’t seem to have a nasty side			0
and when @entity103 most needed him - on the final day a few seasons ago - he rose to the occasion			0
@entity0 is the man in form at the moment but only makes it to no 3 in @entity130 's top 11 2 @entity187 he was like a little rat , who wriggled free of people to score goals			1
his opportunism and ability to score glorious goals in a good but not brilliant @entity73 team was exceptional			0
he played on the edge and took things far too far sometimes			0
but he also gave us some incredible moments			0
despite his faults , @entity187 gave the top flight some incredible moments during his time at @entity73 @entity187 celebrates after scoring away at @entity204 towards the back end of last season 1 @entity117 the package of pace , power , skill , intelligence and trophies makes him my no 1			1
he was a dramatic , driving force when he was in the zone			0
he was unstoppable once he realised he could win games single - handedly			0
when he scored his first goal - at @entity168 - i said to him that i would be able to tell my grandchildren that i had played with him			0
and i rarely congratulated people ! he looked at me astonished			0
@entity117 's pace , power , skill and the trophies make him the no 1 @entity4 striker of all - time @entity117 celebrates his first @entity61 goal away at @entity168 in september 1999 with @entity228 @entity229 mentions need to go to a few others , who narrowly miss out			1
@entity234 was my toughest opponent , @entity235 could have been the new @entity117 , @entity233 is often underestimated , @entity232 has been blighted by injury and @entity238 ’s longevity was incredible .			0

@entity50 *skipper* @entity90 is down in *seventh*
