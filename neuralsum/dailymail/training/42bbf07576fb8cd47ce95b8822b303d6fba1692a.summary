a girl who wrote to @entity1 after she was fed up of the misogynistic nature of her favourite comic books was delighted when the company transformed her into her very own hero			2
@entity6 , 11 , from @entity7 , wrote a letter to the comic giants at the beginning of february expressing her annoyance with the lack of female characters in the superhero strips			1
in it she called for more female characters and action figures and even pointed out that their rival @entity18 were outdoing them in gender equality			2
@entity6 ( left ) wrote a letter to @entity1 complaining that there were n't enough female characters in their strips and movies , the company responded by recreating the 11 - year - old in superhero form ( right ) in the letter @entity6 wrote : ' i 'm upset because there are n't very many girl superheroes or movies and comics from @entity1 ' there are @entity37 and @entity38 movies but not a @entity39 one			1
you have a @entity42 tv show but not a @entity39 one			0
' @entity18 comic made a movie about @entity45 and @entity46 but you have n't made a movie with @entity39			0

' please do something about this			0
girls read comics too and they care			0
' her letter received thousands of shares on @entity58 after @entity75 , @entity6 's father posted it online			1

@entity1 also tweeted to say that they agreed with @entity6 and that more girls should read comics			2
@entity6 with her father @entity86 who posted the letter online to prove they were true to their word the company released a bespoke image of @entity6 reimagined as her very own superhero complete with a costume and cape			1
the comic book super fan told @entity97 says she could never get her head around the gender inequality in the superhero world			2
