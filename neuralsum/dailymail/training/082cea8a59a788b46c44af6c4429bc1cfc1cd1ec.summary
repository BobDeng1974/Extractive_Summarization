a mother suffering from an often debilitating bowel disease has written a no - holds - barred open letter to the cruel bullies who have tutted at her for using disabled toilet facilities			1
@entity5 , 33 , from @entity6 , suffers from @entity7 , which causes ulcers to form inside the digestive system			1
despite her normal outward appearance , the mother - of - three can often be left in huge discomfort by bleeding , diarrhoea , and fatigue , symptoms made worse by unkind remarks from unwitting tormentors			2
the post has received two million hits so far and hundreds of supportive comments - including apologies ms @entity28 wrote the emotionally - charged post entitled ' dear lady who tutted at me using the disabled loos ... ' after she was left ' humiliated , angry and upset ' by the reactions of other women when she used the disabled facility at a public bathroom			1
the post documenting the harrowing encounter has gone viral , attracting around two million hits and supportive comments - and even some apologies - from across the globe			1
@entity5 documents her story about living with the disease in her wittily - titled blog ' @entity45 '			1
she writes : ' when using disabled toilets , i ’ve had women tutting at me , nudging their friends or loudly questioning why i am using the bathroom when i am not disabled			1
' beating the bullies : @entity5 uses her online posts on her blog , so @entity55 , to document living with bowel disease			1
the mum - of - three says she 's delighted her ' open letter ' has raised awareness the open letter has had a huge impact : @entity5 says : ' i regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time , but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions			1
' she explains about what it 's like to live with the condition before pouring scorn on those who 've judged her : ' having an invisible illness , such as @entity7 , is a very isolating and embarrassing experience			1
' i know you saw me running in , with my able bodied legs , my two working arms , without a wheelchair , without any visible sign of disability … and assumed i was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos			1
the fact is that i have no bowel			2
' she adds : ' last week a supermarket cleaner laughed as she heard me using the toilet and then called to her friend : “ oh my god ! you should hear the noise in there ! " ' i was mortified , but more upset to know that my daughter , who was waiting outside heard her too			2
' addressing the woman directly , she says : ' perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because i do n’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin			2
' no external signs : @entity5 feels she suffers more prejudice because people do n't realise she has a disability			1
her ' jpouch ' , which is similar to a colostomy bag , is often well hidden beneath her clothes @entity5 has to wear a ' jpouch ' , an ileostomy bag ( similar to a colostomy bag ) , after having her large colon removed			1
in a bid to raise awareness and help others suffering with the disease she has posed for scantily - clad images in a bid to break the taboo surrounding her illness			2
people with @entity132 , such as @entity7 and crohns disease have the right to use disabled toilets			1
she has since received messages from thousands of people , many with illnesses or disabilities that are not immediately seen telling their own horror stories at being judged unfairly by members of the public			1
but interestingly , @entity5 has also heard from some who admitted they had been the person doing the tutting			1
' i have had a lot of apologies , ' she says : ' people telling me they recognised themselves in my letter and would change their behaviour in future			1
that felt amazing , i regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time , but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions			1
' dear lady who loudly tutted at me using the disabled loos , i know you saw me running in , with my able bodied legs and all			2
you saw me opening the door with my two working arms			0
you saw me without a wheelchair			0
without any visible sign of disability			0
you tutted loudly as i rattled the handle with my hands that work perfectly and my able voice call to my kids that i ’d be out in just a minute			0
my lack of wheelchair may have suggested to you that i was some lazy cow who did n’t care			0
some inconsiderate bitch who was using something i was n’t entitled too			0
( i actually carry a card to explain that i ’m entitled to and have a disability key if you ’d have cared to ask )			0
you may have seen my face blushing as i caught your eye and assumed i was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos			2
living with a disease that people ca n't see : @entity5 uses her blog to highlight body image issues for bowel disease sufferers the fact is that i have no bowel			1
i have a pouch formed from my small intestine which ca n’t handle volume and so i have to go to the toilet and poo several times a day			0
my lack of large intestine means that my stool is totally liquid as i have no means of absorbing the fluids in food and so its really hard to hold it when i need to go			0
i sometimes have accidents which means a large toilet that has a sink right by me means i can clean myself up when things go awry			0
i hate having to use the disabled loos as i have to deal with people like you staring , nudging , tutting			1
and whenever i can , i use the ladies toilets			0
just so you know , disabled loos usually smell bad and do n’t seem to be cleaned as often or as well as the ladies and so i would n’t choose this option unless totally necessary			2
whilst i ’m at it , i ’d like to address the cleaner in the supermarket ladies toilets i used this week			0
as i ran in , knees together , bursting through the door and running to the cubicle , i ’m sorry that the noise of my ( lack of ) bowels made you burst out laughing			0
i can actually take the sniggering as since i had a pouch made from my small intestine because my disease ridden colon was removed during surgery , the noise i make when i defecate is hilariously loud			0
seriously , i get it			0
it ’s comedic in it ’s volume			0
but before you ran outside the loos and called to your friend “ @entity242 ! you should hear the noise in there ! ! ! i would n’t go in if i was you ! ! ! ! ” perhaps you could have noted my daughter who was waiting outside with our trolley because her mum had had to leave her stranded to run to the toilet			2
perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because i do n’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin			0
perhaps you both could have shown a little empathy , a little compassion , a little understanding			0
but humanity and care for fellow human beings is a choice			0
to everyone else reading this , the next time you see someone who does n’t “ look disabled ” using a toilet			2
or someone bursting through and crashing into the toilets noisily			0
remember that not all people who have the right to use disabled toilets are in a wheelchair			1
some of us have a jpouch , a lot of us have an ostomy bag that needs emptying and changing with the use of space , a sink and a bin			1
and even more of us just do n’t want to shit our pants in public			0
think about the nearly 300,000 people in this country who have inflammatory bowel disease ( not to mention the huge number of people with @entity297 ! ! ! ) who need to use the toilet urgently , noisily , smellily … it ’s an embarrassing enough thing to deal with before having to see disapproving looks or hear your laughs and jeering remarks			2
be kind yo … peace out @entity305			0
