by @entity0 published : 01:04 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 31 october 2013 the streets of @entity2 were filled with overexcited fans following the @entity4 win but the police seem to have a handle on the situation			1
seven people were arrested for unruly behavior and the @entity10 used their @entity12 feed as a way to send a stern warning them : ‘ do n’t be number 8 ’			2
that edict was believed to be broken shortly after 1am with new reports that a mob of revelers overturned a parked vehicle , and the police later updated that count to include nine people before telling @entity12 followers to ' @entity26 '			1
@entity56 reporter @entity55 was constantly updating his @entity12 feed from @entity30 and he describe the scene at the landmark spot of the @entity61 finish line where two pressure cooker bombs went off killing three and injuring hundreds just months ago			2
‘ as far as i can see , mob scene on @entity65 is over			0
was tense , and took police a long while to make way to marathon finish , but it ’s over , ’ he wrote just after 1am			0
in the minutes immediately following the @entity4 ’s blowout 6 - 1 finish against the @entity73 , there was little order and a sense of possible violence			1
not messing around : security has been higher in the city following the april bombing at the marathon finish line ready to roll : groups of police officers were using bikes to get around the city so that it would be easier to get through the mobs than if they were in patrol cars ‘ we now have a definite mob at marathon finish line			0
no cops here , ’ @entity55 wrote shortly after midnight			0
‘ young guys really beating on cars now			0
tender scene at marathon finish line has been taken over by bros with beers			0
’ the crowds apparently did start back up , however , as two other local reporters both showed pictures of an overturned car on that same street and wfxt uploaded a video			1
@entity56 reporter @entity105 said that one person was arrested following the overturned vehicle , ‘ but it was actually for a guy throwing bottles at police / crowds , others dispersed ’			1
different lineup : local officials encouraged the die hard fans to ' celebrate responsibly ' after the game revelry : many of the crowds of people chanted the hometown slogan of ' @entity123 ' that has long been used for the baseball team but took on deeper meaning following the bombings in april there were some other violent altercations further afield as campus police at the @entity131 used pepper spray to break up a mob of unruly students who were celebrating after the landmark win			1
@entity2 police and local officials had a reason to be afraid of chaos as the city has seen violence break out following home team celebrations in the past			2
when the @entity4 last won the @entity4 in 2004 while out of town , a 21 - year - old college student was killed after being shot by policeman with a pepper pellet			1
more recently , a 22 - year - old died after being taken into custody by police during the @entity152 @entity151 celebration			0
happy night : the @entity4 beat the @entity73 in the sixth game of the series on wednesday night the police and mayor @entity156 were careful to try to enforce the peace without taking the fun out of the celebration , as wednesday ’s win was the first time that the baseball team has won the league ’s highest title in their beloved home stadium of @entity166 since 1918			1
‘ get the ducks ready , we ’re having a parade ! please , be responsible and let ’s celebrate ! thank you @ @entity173 , ’ the outgoing mayor tweeted			0
the police department tried launching their own hashtag - # @entity26 - and encouraged fans to ‘ engage in championship behavior off the field ’ .			2

nine arrests were reported as thousands *flooded* the streets
wednesday night *'s* game was the first time the @entity4 won a @entity4 at their home stadium of @entity166 since 1918
crowds of overexcited fans overturned one vehicle
