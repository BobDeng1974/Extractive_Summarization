@entity29 ( centre ) grapples with @entity31 and @entity32 during the last @entity3 in october 2014 click here to check out @entity10 's work on @entity35 click here to follow @entity35 on twitter click here to check out @entity15 's work on @entity16 click here to follow @entity16 on twitter feeling confident ? @entity42 : it ’s never wise to feel overly confident in matches like @entity3			1
that said , @entity4 are coming off an incredibly impressive display midweek and frankly a very good 2015 , whereas @entity5 are having the exact opposite situation with iffy performances , @entity51 far from his best and a discontented @entity50 crowd			1
ln : not really , anything can happen in these matches , but @entity4 's form is so much better at the moment			1
@entity56 is congratulated by his team - mates during @entity4 's 1 - 0 win against @entity59 what would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game ? @entity42 : as every year , a win in @entity3 is the sweetest victory and considering it would create distance in the league table , even sweeter			1
ln : it 'd be a crucial win to regain the first spot in the table and put this bad streak to an end			0
@entity77 celebrates after breaking a long scoring drought to put @entity5 ahead on sunday is this the biggest rivalry in @entity81 football ? @entity42 : it ’s certainly currently the rivalry with the most prestige and consequence			1
@entity5 and @entity4 have the two best collections of footballers in the game and @entity88 are guaranteed exhibitions of a will to win and a very high level of football			1
apart from football , it has political issues around it as well			0
@entity98 skips past @entity99 ( right ) during a mesmerising display at the @entity6 on wednesday what are your memories of @entity5 's 3 - 1 @entity3 win in october ? @entity42 : utimately it 's beyond debate , @entity5 deserved the victory but had @entity98 made it 2 - 0 early on , the game would have been very different			1
but really it was no big deal , @entity4 were going through a lot of early adjustments with the manager and new players and losing is part of sport			2
ln : @entity5 completely outplayed @entity4 and deserved the win even after @entity119 earned the lead			2
@entity5 's two expensive superstars both celebrate their side 's second in sunday 's win over @entity125 what 's changed for both teams since that result ? @entity42 : @entity4 have gelled together extremely nicely , the style of play is both exciting and effective , whereas @entity5 have stagnated , suffered a few key injuries and despite the spoils of talent elsewhere miss @entity51 being @entity51			1
ln : @entity51 's form is n't that great , @entity98 is back and @entity5 look tired			2
ronaldo slots home a penalty during @entity5 's 3 - 1 @entity3 win back in october 2014 you mention @entity51 's poor form , what impact do you think he 'll have ? @entity42 : well , he ’s long been one of the best in the world , but his 2015 has been rotten and he 's often been totally ineffective in games			1
he needs others to facilitate him being his best more than @entity98 does			0
if the @entity4 defence put in a performance similar to that against @entity59 , i expect them to keep @entity51 quiet			0
ln : hard one to predict , but he should still be able to create some dangerous plays through @entity4 's shaky defensive system			2
meanwhile , @entity98 is on fire			0
will @entity5 be able to deal with him ? @entity42 : nobody can deal with @entity98			0
@entity157 : if @entity32 ' hamstring is healed , they definitely have a chance			0
@entity5 's defence will have to cope with this stunning attacking trio for @entity163 's @entity4 what are your plans for the day of the game ? @entity42 : i ’ll have some cule ( @entity4 die - hards ) friends over and watch with good company			1
ln : i 'll be covering the game from the @entity6 's press box for @entity176 's @entity16			0
what would a win for your team do to their @entity23 title prospects ? @entity42 : putting distance between @entity5 can only help title prospects			2
both teams have an equally challenging finish to the season so nobody would not want a four - point cushion			0
ln : it would make everything look much better , since a @entity4 win could potentially end the race for @entity23			2
at least , @entity5 need to get a draw			0
all the bookmakers expect @entity4 to be victorious here			0
what 's your prediction ? @entity42 : things feel very positive at @entity6 right now so i would have to go with the bookies and say this dangerous new - look @entity4 will make come out with the win sunday night			1
ln : i 'm expecting a 2 - 2 draw			0
