by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 23:05 est , 12 january 2013 squeezed in between the gleaming @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 at @entity5 ’s training ground on friday mornings is a battered two - door @entity6			1
it belongs to the reverend @entity8 , the club ’s chaplain			1
@entity8 reportedly is the man who has been holding regular sessions with @entity11 , @entity5 ’s volatile @entity12 striker with a penchant for bust - ups with members of his own team and brawls with his fiery manager , @entity19			1
' i ’m there to provide pastoral support and friendship to the players and the staff			1
sometimes the players from overseas feel homesick or have problems at home , and need someone to confide in , ' says @entity8 , 36 , who was ordained into the @entity30 in 2004 and assumed his role at @entity5 two years ago			1
support : reverend @entity8 is the chaplain at the @entity34 football club @entity5 help : the reverend also works with the business community in @entity37 providing support to city workers poor , over-indulged rich kids , you might conclude , but @entity8 and the charitable organisation he works for - @entity44 @entity43 – believe that a growing number of players are turning to @entity47 , not so much to bring them three points on a saturday afternoon but to help cope with life in the spotlight			1
confrontation : @entity11 clashes with @entity5 manager @entity19 in a training ground bust - up fridays is when @entity8 puts on his dog collar and heads for @entity5 ’s @entity55 training base			1
visible on the touchline , in the club canteen and in the offices , he makes himself especially available to players who are injured and need a morale booster , or those who have lost their place in the team and want some reassurance			1
' i enjoy getting to know the younger players			1
they are under a huge amount of pressure and although football operates by its own terms , with lots of money and privileges , when you strip it all down you are still dealing with human beings who need to be heard and supported , ' he says			1
@entity8 does not hold prayer meetings before matches – unlike at @entity80 where the chaplain , the reverend @entity81 , gathers together as many as ten players for a 15 minute informal service in a room near the home dressing room			1
he asks for any specific prayer requests , reads a passage from the @entity89 and then gives a short talk			2
' we do n’t pray for a result but we do pray that the game will be played in the right spirit , without violence on the pitch or in the stands , ' says @entity81			2
' the overall feeling is that the players want to honour @entity47 with their talents			1
' does the @entity102 manager @entity101 ever summon him at half - time to conjure up some divine inspiration ? ' absolutely not – and it ’s not my place to lecture the players about their behaviour , but @entity101 spoke last year at our annual conference and is very supportive			1
he has a faith himself and sees the importance of what we do			2
' controversial : @entity11 in action			0
he has had bust - ups with team - mates and his manager @entity81 , 44 , who happens to be a @entity80 fan , has been chaplain of the @entity123 club for 12 years			2
his official title at @entity44 @entity43 is pastoral support director in @entity126			1
currently , 66 of the 92 league clubs in @entity133 have dedicated chaplains provided by the charity , a number that has swelled in recent years with the arrival of more and more players from overseas , many of whom seem keen to demonstrate their faith by crossing themselves before running on to the pitch or kneeling in prayerful thanks after scoring a goal			2
@entity140 , the @entity142 born @entity141 striker , regularly shows off a ' @entity47 is great ' t - shirt , and @entity144 , the @entity145 winger , has played in boots with ' @entity47 is love ' inscribed on them			0
at @entity149 , @entity150 , the @entity151 defender , is in the habit of placing his hands on team - mate @entity155 ’s head and offering a prayer during the warm - up before games - even though the @entity159 seems coy about helping @entity155 score on a regular basis			0
go back a few years and footballers were reticent to wear their religion on their sleeves – or on their t - shirts for that matter			0
one of those who did come out as a committed @entity168 was @entity169 , the @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 player who retired at the end of 2009			0
@entity80 fan : @entity81 is the pastoral support director and chaplain at the @entity177 he remembers a time when his team - mate at @entity172 , @entity180 , was the butt of jokes for praying and reading the @entity89 before matches			1
' when i became a @entity168 i could talk to @entity180 and then the two of us would meet up with the chaplain and soon others were showing an interest and the whole atmosphere changed , ' says @entity169 , who now heads up a charity called @entity126 and @entity192			2
service : @entity81 holds an informal meeting for players near the home dressing room before long , @entity197 , @entity180 and the chaplain had introduced prayer meetings at the club , which still continue today			1
' a lot of the younger players came along and were able to talk about things they could n’t discuss with the manager and coaches , ' says @entity169			2
' some of them had got caught up in the bright lights and would ask whether they had done something wrong			0
i would tell them that " yes you may have done something wrong but you are here now and can start again			0
" ' @entity169 says that when he became a @entity168 he asked the club chaplain : ' do i have to be a vicar on the pitch ? ' to which the chaplain replied that it was a player ’s ' motive ' that was important			2
' i did not want to lessen my competitive spirit and i still wanted to go in hard when tackling but i think i was more gracious with referees when they made bad decisions			0
' i realised that , like me , they were trying to do their best and , like me , they made mistakes			0
and it helped me deal with defeat better			0
i still hurt but there was something else going on in my life			0
' @entity126 can distort the person you are – all the houses , the fast cars , the lifestyle – but it does n’t actually mean anything			0
' a more traditional role for the likes of chaplains such as @entity8 and @entity81 is spreading the ashes of supporters in their respective club ’s @entity244			0
@entity81 conducted 12 ceremonies of that kind last year			0
but are n’t they sometimes nauseated by the vast sums of money players earn , often without giving much back to the community ? ' the money is not the issue			2
there are a lot of very selfish poor people just as there are a lot of very selfish rich people , ' says @entity8			0
' and , actually , many footballers do n’t get enough credit for what they do outside the game			0
' i ’m not twisting arms to get them into the @entity266 but presenting them with a chance to explore faith further when they are ready to do so			0
' so , has @entity11 seen the error of his ways ? is repentance in the air ? “ i would never discuss anyone ’s personal situation			0
all i would say is that at a club like @entity5 there are a lot of very decent people who do n’t share my faith			1
