by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 has announced a $ 2.84 billion loss after a battle , the worst result suffered by the airline in its history			1
the massive after - tax loss was for the year ending june 30 , compares to a $ 6 million profit a year ago			1
the result is considerably worse than anticipated , with analysts predicting a loss of between $ 800 million and $ 1 billion			2
the loss comes as @entity3 is undergoing a transformation program aimed to streamline and modernise its operations			2
in february it was announced the transformation program will see 5,000 redundancies across the company , 2,500 of which have already taken place			0
the losses included a $ 2.6 billion write - down to the value of its ageing international fleet , which were purchased at a time when the @entity39 dollar was weaker against the @entity41 dollar , such as @entity42 , purchased in 2000 when the dollar was trading at us $ 0.57 compared to us $ 0.93 now			0
excluding the writedown and other one - off costs , @entity3 made an underlying pre-tax loss of $ 646 million , compared to a $ 192 million profit a year ago			1
chief executive @entity22 described the result as ' confronting ' , but said the massive loss represented the year that is past			2
' we have now come through the worst , ' he said in a statement on thursday , adding that the company is undergoing the biggest transition since @entity3 was privatised in 1995			0
mr @entity22 said the company was ' optimistic ' that they would be able to deliver the company back to profitability and post a profit before tax in the first half of next year , saying that the transformation program was working			0
@entity3 reported the worst loss in the company 's history today , with an after tax loss of $ 2.84 billion , almost triple the most dire predictions from analysts the airline posted a dramatic loss of profits after a brutal year of competition with rival airline @entity71 ' with our accelerated @entity3 transformation program we are already emerging as a leaner , more focused and more sustainable @entity3 , ' he said			1
unions and politicians have joined a chorus of criticism of @entity3 management			1
independent senator @entity80 has today asked the @entity81 to investigate the airline , suggesting @entity3 has breached investment regulations			1
the @entity80 said @entity3 management , led by mr @entity22 , had trashed the reputation of a great airline			1
' i can not believe what @entity22 says , i can not understand why he is still in that position , ' he said			0
' @entity22 has made so many contradictory statements over the years and predictions , that have proved not be carried out			2
' there 's a case here for @entity81 , as the corporate watchdog , to thoroughly investigate the statements made by @entity22 and his management team over the years			1
' what 's at stake here are 30 thousand jobs , the only people who should be sacked are @entity22 , @entity103 the chairman and the board - they have presided over this			1
' meanwhile , the airline has ruled out selling or floating its profitable frequent flyer business , @entity109 in order to fund its turnaround			0
the frequent flyer program reported its fifth straight year of double - digit growth and has increased membership from five to 10 million over the last year			0
' after careful consideration , our judgment was that @entity109 continued to offer major profitable growth opportunities , and there was insufficient justification for a partial sale , ' mr @entity22 said			0
however , mr @entity22 said they may consider the partial sale of the international business , which did not perform as strongly as the domestic business			0
@entity3 has established a holding company so they can seek future investment , but would not speculate about how much of when @entity128 would be sold			0
the poor results were blamed on market capacity growth in excess of demand , lower consumer confidence , and high fuel costs , which are up $ 253 million from last year to a total of $ 4.5 billion			2

@entity3 has announced a $ 2.84 billion loss for the year ending june 30
loss comes after battle with @entity71 and poor performance of international @entity3 division
the @entity81 has been asked to investigate statements and level of *disclosures* made by @entity3 management over several years
