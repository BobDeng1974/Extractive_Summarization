a colony of ants could help scientists develop a new strain of antibiotics to help fight the growing global menace of resistant superbugs			1
prime minister @entity7 has today warned that the world could be plunged back into the ' dark ages of medicine ' because of lack of new antibiotics			1
bacteria is becoming increasingly resistant to existing medicines and new stronger antibiotics need to be found before some diseases become uncurable			0
@entity18 scientists at the @entity19 say the leafcutter ants could save countless lives thanks to a natural antibiotic they produce			1
three colonies of leafcutter ants could provide a breakthrough in developing new antibiotics to help in the fight against resistant superbugs			1
the ants have already helped scientists at the @entity19 discover two potential new drugs researcher dr @entity31 said : ' antibiotic resistance is a global health threat			1
even common infections which have been treatable for decades can once again kill			0
' our research is motivated by an urgent need to find new antibiotics			0
' we hope that these leafcutter ants will help us solve antibiotic resistance and provide us with the next generation of drugs			1
' these ants have already helped us find two new antibiotics which we hope will be useful in clinical medicine			2
' the pioneering research by the @entity46 centres on a particular type of fungus the ants eat , and how the ants ’ natural resistance protects it			1
dr @entity31 said : ' leafcutter ants from @entity55 and @entity56 evolved antibiotic use 50million years ago			0
an increasing number of superbugs , including @entity60 - a computer generated image of the bacteria , pictured - are becoming resistant to the antibiotics currently used by doctors across the world ' they love to eat a particular kind of fungus , which the worker ants protect using natural antibiotics produced by bacteria on their bodies			1
' the worker ants climb over the fungus and sniff it , and any fungus , which we call weeds , that are n’t the food they eat they take over to a completely different area and sterilise			2
' they rub more than one antibiotic - they produce several - onto the weeds using their chest plates which excrete it , and then bury it			0
this means the fungus they eat can thrive			0
' prime minister @entity7 today warned we could be plunged back into the dark ages of medicine if new antibiotics are not found he added : ' we questioned why there were no problems in ants compared to human antibiotics and found they use multiple drug combinations to prevent drug resistance from arising			1
' so by using multiple antibiotics at once , we can slow the rise of antibiotic - resistant superbugs			0
' this is something that human medicine is only just starting to explore			0
' there are eight scientists at the university who have been working on the project for seven years with three large colonies of ants			2
they hope the ants will not only provide the next generation of antibiotics but also show beneficial ways of working with bacteria			2
the team ’s research will be on display at the @entity127 2014 from july 1 to july 6 , which showcases the best in @entity18 innovation			0
a captive leafcutter ant colony will be displayed alongside an ‘ antibiotic discovery zone ’ at the @entity127			0
two thirds of antibiotics are ' natural products ' made by a group of bacteria called actinomycetes that live in the soil			2
but when soil bacteria produce these antibiotics they also express resistance genes to protect them against the antibiotic ’s toxic effects			1
these resistance genes have spread to other ' bad ' bacteria , causing some strains to evolve and render many antibiotics useless .			0

scientists at the @entity19 believe three colonies of leafeater ants could be the key to developing new strains of antibiotics
it comes as prime minister @entity7 warns we risk being plunged back to the ' dark ages ' of medicine if new drugs are not discovered
the team have already identified two potential new drugs
research centres on specific type of fungus the ants eat and how they produce a natural antibiotic from bacteria on their bodies
