three veteran producers have been fired by a @entity2 tv station after they published a series of fake and racially offensive names supposedly of the pilots on - board the crashed @entity7 flight			1
investigative producer @entity8 , special projects producer @entity9 and producer @entity10 were all fired over the incident			1
noon news producer @entity12 told colleagues he was leaving for health reasons			1
the producer with seven year 's experience at @entity18 wrote ' @entity38 * * * ' it is unclear whether @entity10 - who cites ordering video and writing scripts among his responsibilities at the network - was in charge of the broadcast , but his two word response and entire @entity48 profile was deleted moments later			1
news director @entity50 called newsroom staff into a conference room wednesday and informed them of the dismissals			0
@entity18 was forced to make an immediate apology moments after the on - air gaffe at @entity57 yesterday			2
fired : @entity58 has been dismissed following the on - air mistake presenter @entity60 announced that the station had just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board @entity7 when it crashed at @entity66 on saturday			1
she then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter as they appeared on screen over footage of the wreckage			0
the names poked fun at the crash and have been further criticized for their racist undertones			0
the first name — ' captain @entity35 ' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right			0
however , with the camera 's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast , ms. @entity60 continued to read without so much as flinching : ' @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86			0
' it is not yet clear where the names , which mock the tragedy which killed three , originated			0
the broadcaster said they came from a source who they were refusing to identify			0
they also tried to justify the move saying they confirmed the names with the @entity26 before airing them			1
the safety board admitted a summer intern told @entity18 the spelling of the names was correct			1
the broadcaster said they never checked the position of the employee in the organisation and rushed to get the names into their lunchtime broadcast			2
on his evening newscast , anchor @entity111 apologized further			0
' first , we never read the names out loud , phonetically sounding them out , ' he said			0
' then , during our phone call to the @entity26 where the person confirmed the spellings of the names , we never asked that person to give us their position with the agency			1
' we heard this person verify the information without questioning who they were and then rushed the names on our noon newscast			2
' in a statement the @entity26 admitted a summer intern had ' erroneously ' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was ' acting outside the scope of his authority ' in doing so			1
' the @entity26 apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of @entity7 , which crashed at @entity66 on july 6 , ' the @entity26 said in a statement			1
' earlier today , in response to an inquiry from a media outlet , a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft , ' it added			1
days earlier , @entity18 news director @entity50 was crowing about how good his news operation had performed			1
' being first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment , but being 100 % accurate , effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air , is what we are most proud of as a newsroom			0
' the station issued a statement on acknowledging it had ' misidentified the pilots involved			0
' third victim : a @entity2 hospital says a third victim of a plane crash , a @entity174 girl , has died from her injuries			0
she was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after @entity7 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week in an - online apology , @entity18 general manager @entity180 wrote : ' we sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize , both in the newscast where the mistake occurred , as well as on our website and social media sites			1
nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity , and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again			0
' however , the apologies from @entity18 and the @entity26 have done little to abate anger over the issue			1
@entity199 , president of the @entity200 , said in a statement : ' those names were not only wrong , but so grossly offensive that it ’s hard for us at the @entity200 to fathom how those names made it on the broadcast			2
' with such a vaunted reputation among local news stations , we expected much more from @entity18			1
we fail to understand how those obviously phony names could escape detection before appearing on the broadcast and were spoken by the news anchor			1
we urge @entity18 to conduct a thorough review to prevent similar lapses			2
' ' @entity200 is embarrassed for the anchor of the noon broadcast , who was as much a victim as @entity18 ’s viewers and @entity18 ’s hard - working staff , including the journalists who produced stellar work covering the crash			2
' ' but we ’re mostly saddened that a tragedy that took the lives of three people and injured scores of other passengers could be taken as an opportunity for an apparent joke			0
' another unidentified teen has died of her injuries bring the death toll in the tragic crash up to three			0
broken news : anchor @entity60 read the names off the teleprompter and did n't bat an eye , adding that the information had been confirmed by the @entity26 a further 180 people were injured , many serious			1
based in @entity244 , @entity245 , the @entity243 affiliate represents a city where 16.8 per cent of the population is @entity248			0
@entity18 also broadcasts in two heavily @entity248 - populated communities : @entity2 , where @entity250 make up 33.3 per cent of the total population and @entity252 , where 32 per cent of the population is @entity248			2
@entity18 ’s false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week 's disastrous @entity255 crash could be attributed to @entity257 ' culture ' and whether @entity259 ’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could have played a role in the crash			2
@entity255 has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot @entity269 - kook and @entity270 - min. coverage of the tragic plane crash at @entity66 , which killed three people and injured dozens of others last saturday has proven tricky for some news outlets			0
the @entity276 apologized for its front page headline ' fright 214 , ' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an @entity248 accent .			0

@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were all fired
news producer @entity12 told people he was leaving for health reasons
@entity286 broadcast inaccurate names but apologized for the error *quickly*
@entity18 confirmed information with the @entity26
@entity26 says a summer intern verified the names when approached by the station
