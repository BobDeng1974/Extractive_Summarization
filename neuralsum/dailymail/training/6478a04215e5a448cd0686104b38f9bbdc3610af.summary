she spent most of the winter so far in @entity2 , lingering around the waters of @entity4 but on saturday , @entity6 - a 2,300 pound great white shark that is being tracked by research team @entity5 - reared her head just north of @entity9 , and appears to be heading south searching for warmer climes			1
fortunately for @entity12 , @entity6 's whereabouts can be checked online			2
@entity6 is one of a group of great whites that @entity5 have been following			2
the sharks are tagged with a transmitter and the research groups use radios to follow them			0
one of the others , @entity38 , who at 3,456 pounds is much larger than @entity6 , likes to stay in far - out @entity40 , keeping off @entity25 and the @entity41 , according to @entity42			2
but @entity6 likes to travel up and down the east coast throughout the year , often passing through @entity38 's territory			0
@entity6 was first tagged on august 20 , 2013			1
transmitter : @entity6 has wondered the east coast since she was tagged on august 20 , 2013 signal : the transmitter allows research groups like @entity5 to track @entity6 when she surfaces in the first 10 months , she traveled over 5,000 miles			1
the tags can last up to five years			0
having spent most of the season in @entity4 , many thought @entity6 might stay there			1
she has even gone as far north as the southern coast of the panhandle			0
however as the @entity2 waters got holder she made a sharp journey south , according to @entity58			0
within days @entity6 was in @entity59 , @entity60 , and came so close to shore she startled locals			0
traveler : in the first 10 months of her tracking , she traveled over 5,000 miles then on thursday , @entity6 and @entity38 were quite close to each other , before @entity6 turned up in north @entity17 saturday			1
it will be interesting to see whether @entity6 revisits the route she took last year , when she traveled all the way down to the @entity68			2
the largest ever recorded great white was 21 feet long			0
revisiting ? : last year he shark was first spotted near @entity71 , passing close to @entity72 before going to the @entity68 @entity73 : in june last year , @entity6 was clocked off the coast of @entity17 , heading towards @entity75			1

@entity6 , a 14 - foot @entity77 , sends a signal every time she surfaces
was implanted with a transmitter in august 2013 and tracked
has spent most of winter in @entity4
but one month *ago* she pinged heading south
was clocked in @entity9 , @entity17 , on saturday afternoon
*possibly* heading to the @entity68
