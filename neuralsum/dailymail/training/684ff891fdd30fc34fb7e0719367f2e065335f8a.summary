one in four people in @entity1 now suffer from hay fever every year by @entity3 published : 12:07 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 27 march 2013 @entity1 scientists say they have developed the first pollen and allergy - free cedar tree as @entity9 gets set to wind the clocks forward and prepares to welcome in the signs of summer , @entity1 experts may have engineered a solution to one of its most dreaded problems - hay fever			1
scientists at the @entity17 announced they have successfully developed the first pollen and allergy - free cedar tree			1
they say by using a process called genetic recombination , which alters the @entity21 makeup of the plant , they were able to create region - specific trees that do not produce pollen			1
@entity26 , who led the research , said although @entity29 scientists have already created pollenless pine trees , it has never been achieved before with cedars			0
the completely pollen - free trees are still in the experimental stage , but low - pollen trees have already been planted across @entity1 - which has recorded worsening hay fever figures in recent years , @entity33 reports			1
the number of @entity1 who suffer from hay fever has tripled in the last 30 years			1
one in four people in @entity1 now suffer from hay fever every year , and pollen counts have already been especially high this year – five times higher than last spring			1
researchers have attributed this to a sudden spike in temperatures , a hot summer last year , and also a large amount of the cedar trees - known as ' @entity51 '			1
they say by using a process called genetic recombination , which alters the @entity21 makeup of the plant , they were able to create region - specific trees that do not produce pollen an allergy causes the body ’s immune system to see a harmless substance , as harmful , and produce antibodies called @entity63 ( immunoglobulin e ) to fight it			1
this results in the release of histamine , which produces a range of conditions including itching and rashes , swelling , gut symptoms such as vomiting , stomach ache and diarrhoea , and respiratory symptoms such as coughing , sneezing , asthma , blocked or runny nose			0
severe cases can be life threatening — this is known as anaphylactic shock			0
the lips , tongue or face can swell up or the throat may constrict , causing breathing difficulties that need urgent medical attention			0
a mass of the trees were planted after @entity90 , in a bid to aid the post-war construction boom			0
since then , demand for the wood has dropped off , and the trees have matured and so now emit more pollen			2
@entity1 retailers have been reaping the benefits of the soaring pollen count however , with a host of products , including surgical masks , anti-pollen glasses , nose plugs , nasal sprays , and portable air purifiers small enough to be worn around the neck			2
currently up to one in eight people in @entity9 experience moderate or severe hayfever symptoms			2
@entity111 counts are usually high between the start of june and the middle of july			0
@entity111 is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle , and contains proteins that can cause the nose , eyes , throat and sinuses to become swollen , irritated and inflamed			0
there is currently no cure for hay fever but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment , at least to a certain extent			1
an agricultural research group is creating a hypoallergenic apple by substituting natural proteins for those which do n't cause an allergic reaction			0
apples are not usually associated with allergies			0
however , 75 per cent of people suffering from an allergy to birch pollen are also allergic to apples			2
those sensitive to the fruit can still experience unpleasant irritation and blistering of the tongue and lips .			0

@entity1 experts used process called genetic recombination to create tree
it is *believed* the tree is the world *'s* first pollen - free cedar
one in four people in @entity1 now suffer from hay fever every year
