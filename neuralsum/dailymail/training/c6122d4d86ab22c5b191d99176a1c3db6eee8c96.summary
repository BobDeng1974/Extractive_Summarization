@entity10 told @entity11 that ‘ everything would change ’ if @entity3 vote to go it alone in the referendum due in autumn 2014			1
an independent @entity3 would not automatically be a member of the @entity4 and would have to ‘ start afresh ’ , he added			1
the comments are the strongest from a government minister on the issue of @entity3 ’s status in the @entity4 , which has become the focus of early skirmishes in the independence debate			1
@entity3 ’s first minister @entity2 was ridiculed after claiming in a tv interview that he had obtained legal advice on @entity4 membership but it had to remain secret			1
he later admitted no advice had been sought			0
in a debate in @entity28 today , mr @entity10 said it was ‘ only an assertion ’ that an independent @entity3 would simply continue in membership of the @entity4			1
the scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014 , when mr @entity2 hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the @entity34 he added : ‘ the @entity35 has managed to negotiate , over the years , exemptions from membership of the euro and from the @entity40 common visa area , ensuring that the @entity35 can maintain control over its own monetary and border policies			2

’ if @entity3 backed independence , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 would continue the international legal personality of the @entity35			2
‘ @entity3 , having decided to leave the @entity35 , would start afresh			1
the overwhelming weight of international legal precedent underscores this point			0
‘ the most likely scenario by far is that an independent @entity3 would have to apply to join the @entity4 as a new state , involving negotiation with the rest of the @entity35 and other member @entity71 , the outcome of which can not be predicted			2
‘ further analysis will be published by the @entity35 government next year			0
