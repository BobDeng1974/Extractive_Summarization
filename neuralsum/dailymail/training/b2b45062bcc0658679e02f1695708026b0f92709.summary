by @entity0 in @entity1 former @entity3 captain @entity2 believes there is no outstanding candidate to replace @entity6 as national skipper and that @entity9 ’s team are still miles away from winning a major tournament			1
@entity6 retired from international football this week after a disappointing @entity12 , leaving @entity9 to choose a replacement			1
@entity2 , who played 90 times for his country , spoke this week on @entity17 ’s pre-season tour of @entity18 and admitted he is depressed by @entity3 ’s immediate prospects			1
even a few years ago , you had the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity6 and @entity44 who could have been captain			2
' there was a decision to be made over which one you would go with as captain because they were all strong candidates			0
but at this moment in time , i do n’t think there is an outstanding candidate			2
' yes it does worry me a bit for @entity3 ’s future			2
we have n’t got an outstanding candidate for captain and that is a worrying sign			2
' @entity2 believes @entity17 striker @entity21 is among the leading candidates for the job			1
he added : ' you look at it and it is a difficult one			0
you want somebody who is a talker on the pitch , somebody who can organise and i think it is difficult for a forward to do that			0
' but if you look at the @entity3 set - up at the moment , the candidates are probably @entity78 , @entity79 , because he will be in the team , and @entity21			1
time to kick on : @entity21 is on tour with @entity17 and could be a future @entity3 captain leading the way : @entity21 may soon be captain of @entity17 and @entity3 stepping up ? @entity21 is a leading candidate to take over from @entity6 ' and the only one who really stands out is @entity21			1
there is no other real candidate when you look at it			0
if @entity21 is not first choice in the @entity3 team , it will mean some of the young lads will have come through and done really well because , now that @entity6 has stepped down , @entity21 is by far @entity3 ’s best player			1
' it does n’t matter if you captain your club , it is about who is right for the job and who has the experience to be captain			0
' if @entity21 was to be selected as captain , it might give him a real boost where he really feels he needs to lead by example.s that may get the best out of @entity107 , but that is the manager ’s choice at the end of the day			2
' @entity2 - speaking at an event in @entity1 hosted by @entity112 's official timekeeper - watched @entity3 ’s dismal @entity12 summer with dismay			1
safe hands : @entity78 ( left ) is another senior @entity3 player who could take over from @entity6 option : @entity79 ( right ) has become a key member of the @entity3 team and could be captain contender no laughing matter : @entity2 ( centre ) says @entity3 's lack of captaincy options is a worry he said : ' you need world class players to compete in major competitions and we have n’t got enough at this moment in the squad			1
you would hope that some of the young lads come through and prove they are top quality players , the likes of @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
' now that they are coming into the squad , they are getting the chance , but we just have to wait for a year or two years			0
' there are others , such as @entity142 and @entity143 , who you have to give time to progress to become top - drawer players			0
otherwise , if they prove that they are just good players , it will be a disappointment			0
because of the qualifying group we have for @entity150 , i think we can go on and progress to the finals again , but as far as going on to win something like that , i still think we are way off			0
