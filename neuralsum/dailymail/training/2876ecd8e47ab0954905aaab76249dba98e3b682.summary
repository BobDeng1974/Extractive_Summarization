ex-serviceman @entity0 , 82 , has been left outraged after learning an off - duty fireman who attacked him in his home in @entity3 , @entity4 , will not face charges an off - duty fireman who attacked an 82 - year - old veteran in his own home will not face charges after police decided an apology was enough			1
cancer - stricken ex-serviceman @entity0 was beaten by @entity12 during a row in the hallway of his eighth floor flat in @entity16 , @entity4 , last friday			1
@entity12 was arrested and admitted assault for the attack - but was later released with a fine and told to write a letter of apology			1
the police decided not to hand the case to prosecutors and it was instead dealt with using new laws known as an @entity25			0
but mr @entity0 - who has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye - is outraged at the move and has demanded @entity12 be prosecuted			1
retired mr @entity0 , who served with @entity30 @entity29 in the 1950s , said : ' that law is fine if somebody nicks an apple from a shop - but this is a serious crime			1
' the most terrifying thing was being hit in my eye where i have a cancerous tumour , that ca n't be operated on because i would have to go into too deep a sleep			0
' i 'm not far away from it being curtains			0
it 's disgusting that @entity12 is going to get away with attacking me in my own home			1
' police said a suspended prosecution under the new government measures which replaces police cautions			0
@entity12 was handed conditions with his punishment which were to pay £ 150 compensation and a fine of £ 50			1
he was also told to write a letter of apology to mr @entity0 and banned from entering his street			1
if he does not comply with the conditions , @entity12 will be hauled before a court			2
mr @entity0 , who has 16 grandchildren and six great - grandchildren , spent 28 years being a @entity60 for sick children at schools and hospitals in @entity4			1
mr @entity0 , who is a longtime friend of @entity65 actor @entity64 , said he was verbally abused before @entity12 forced his way inside and hit him causing a cut and a black eye			1
@entity69 said the appropriate action was taken because @entity12 had no previous convictions , he admitted his guilt and expressed remorse			2
detective chief inspector @entity74 , @entity75 , said : ' a suspended prosecution was the most appropriate disposal for this offence of @entity79 due to the offender having no previous convictions , fully admitting the offence and showing genuine remorse for his actions			0
veteran mr @entity0 suffered a small cut and black eye in the attack			2
the 82 - year - old has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye ' prior to that decision being made the victim was consulted and , at that time , was satisfied with that outcome			2
' under the current two - tier out of court disposals pilot project a suspended prosecution is the stronger of two options - the lower being a statutory community resolution			0
' the suspended prosecution means that if the offender fails to fulfil the conditions imposed they will face action at court			0
' the conditions applied in this case included writing a letter of apology to the victim by december 31 , paying £ 150 compensation and a fine of £ 50 , plus a ban from entering the victim 's street			1
' had the matter been progressed to court it is unlikely the offender would have received any greater penalty and possible he could have received a lesser sanction			0
' the victim was spoken to again and raised concerns about the amount of time the offender had been given to write the letter of apology			1
' the letter has since been submitted to the investigating officer and forwarded to the victim			2
mr @entity125 pictured during his army days with the @entity30 @entity29 , said he was ' disguested ' that @entity12 had got away with it ' the victim 's son contacted officers to raise concerns and the reasoning has been explained to him			2
' the victim was spoken to again by the investigating officer and had changed his mind and was no longer satisfied with the use of a suspended prosecution			0
' while the process does take account of the views of victims , police officers will use their professional judgement to assess the circumstances and decide on the most appropriate outcome			0
' a @entity146 spokeswoman said : ' we are investigating an incident that occurred on friday evening involving an off - duty firefighter			0
' we are not able to comment on on - going investigations			0
