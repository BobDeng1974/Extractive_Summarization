@entity1 , 86 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was treated for minor bruising at @entity2 in march last year after a fall while staying at her son 's house in @entity16			1
despite having just minor bruising from the fall , mrs @entity1 was kept in the hospital under observation			1
but when she was moved to a different ward the next day , the pensioner was not seen by a doctor for another three days			2
by that time , mrs @entity1 had contracted norovirus - from which she died two weeks later			1
speaking after the inquest into her death , the family said mrs @entity1 had been well before the hospital admission and had been ' up and down the stairs ' just days earlier			1
in a statement the family said : ' mr @entity33 and his family are still coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital with a bruised elbow and went on to die			2
' at an inquest into her death at @entity43 , the hearing heard how the mother - of - two had been kept in hospital under observation because of her age and frail health			2
doctors , who saw mrs @entity1 on march 17 , were concerned that she might have suffered an unforeseen injury during the fall			1
the next day , the patient was moved into a private room on the @entity54 - which her family claim was dirty and understaffed - but was not looked at by doctors			2
by the time she was checked on march 21 , mrs @entity1 was vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea			1
she died on april 10 from norovirus , pneumonia and haematuria , which is when there is blood in the urine			2

the inquest heard there were ' staffing pressures ' on the ward which ' could have been an explanation ' for why mrs @entity1 was not checked for three days by medical staff - in which time she contracted the virus the hearing heard the @entity54 is meant to have at least two nurses and two health care assistants on duty at all times			1
nurse @entity88 said : ' there was a mixture of ward staff , agency staff and bank staff [ cover ] on the ward			2
it was a challenge to meet minimum staffing levels at times			0
' when coroner @entity98 asked whether that could be ' an explanation for why mrs @entity1 was not looked in on for those three days ' , the nurse replied ' yes '			1
lawyer @entity100 , who was representing mr @entity33 , told the inquest it was ' highly likely ' that mrs @entity1 caught the virus on the ward			1

' the complaint was that there was an incontinence sheet in the room from the patient before			0
' sister @entity118 , the nurse in charge of the hospital at night , apologised to the @entity33 family and admitted the room was untidy - but not dirty			0

the private room was untidy			0
i would not say dirty			0
' recording a narrative verdict , @entity16 coroner @entity98 said : ' this woman was admitted to hospital having suffered a fall			0
she was frail due to her age and various other health issues			0
' she was not seen by the medic team for three days , during which she had norovirus			2
the delay seems to be after she contracted the virus			0
' there were staffing pressures at the hospital and there was a medley of @entity149 , agency and bank staff working in what was a temporary winter ward			1
' after a discussion with the family she was placed on the @entity155			0
she died on april 10			0
i offer my sincere condolences to her family			0

she was up and down the stairs , eating three meals a day			0
' his partner @entity167 added : ' she had a wicked sense of humour			0
she certainly was not frail			0
' a statement read on behalf of the @entity104 's solicitor @entity172 read : ' today â€™s inquest has highlighted a number of failings on the part of @entity149			1
' these include ward cleanliness , communication and staffing pressures			1
the main one is how mrs @entity1 went for three days without being seen			1
