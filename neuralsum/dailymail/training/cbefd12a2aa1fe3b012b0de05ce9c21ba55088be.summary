by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 15:27 est , 29 august 2013 it 's always nice to get a ' like ' when you post a status or photograph on @entity5 , but research has revealed that the brains of those who use the social networking site the most are more affected by the feedback they receive than less regular users			1
scientists have discovered that reward circuits in the brain linked to food , money , sex and reputation can predict how likely a person is to use @entity5			1
researchers found that those whose nucleus accumbens in the brain responded most strongly to positive feedback were the same people who used the social networking site most intently			1
reward circuits in the brain linked to food , money , sex and reputation can predict how likely a person is to use @entity5 , according to a new study the nucleus accumbens is a ‘ small but critical ’ part of the brain which processes rewards			1
dr @entity37 , of @entity39 ’s @entity38 , looked at the activity in this part of the brain in 31 people and compared the results to the people ’s @entity5 usage			2
dr @entity37 said : ‘ as human beings , we evolved to care about our reputation			0
in today ’s world , one way we ’re able to manage our reputation is by using social media websites like @entity5			2
’ @entity5 was chosen for the study because interactions on the website are carried out in view of the user ’s friends , and the public , and can affect their reputation			0
people whose nucleus accumbens structure in the brain responds most strongly to positive feedback are most likely to use @entity5 intently ‘ @entity71 ’ someone is positive social feedback , and can be considered related to their reputation			1
participants completed a questionnaire to show how many friends they had and how many minutes they spent on @entity5			0
they also participated in a video interview , and were then told whether people thought highly of them			0
researchers recorded functional neuroimaging ( @entity80 ) of the participants ’ brains during these procedures			0
results showed that participants who received positive feedback about themselves produced stronger activation of the nucleus accumbens than when they saw the positive feedback that another person received			1
the strength of this difference corresponded to participants ’ reported intensity of @entity5 use			0
dr @entity37 said : ‘ our study reveals that the processing of social gains in reputation in the left nucleus accumbens predicts the intensity of @entity5 use across individuals			2
‘ these findings expand upon our present knowledge of nucleus accumbens function as it relates to complex human behaviour			0
’ dr @entity37 said it was not known if the results showed that positive social feedback drives people to interact on social media , or if sustained use of social media changes the way positive social feedback is processed by the brain			1
the report was published in the journal frontiers in @entity122 .			0

reward circuits in the brain predict how likely a person is to use @entity5
people whose nucleus accumbens structure in the brain respond most strongly to positive feedback use the social networking site most intently
it is *n't* known if positive social feedback drives people to interact on social media , or if use of social media changes the way positive social feedback is processed by the brain
