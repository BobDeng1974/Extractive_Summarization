by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 10 july 2013 the corporation 's controller of comedy commissioning @entity3 said @entity5 is ' not a pariah ' he has been axed from @entity7 and was cut from this year ’s @entity9 schedule for making a string of sick jokes			1
but the @entity14 still wants @entity5 to return to its mainstream tv channels , its new comedy boss has revealed			1
the corporation ’s controller of comedy commissioning @entity3 said the controversial comic is ‘ not a pariah ’ and may return if the right programme emerges			1
despite admitting many viewers see him as an ‘ offence machine ’ , he said @entity5 ’s comedy was ‘ done with intelligence and a purpose ’ , adding : ‘ if you ’re worried about offending anyone you wo n’t make any comedy			1
’ mr @entity3 also revealed he hopes to commission new special episodes of @entity29 , saying the door is always open to the 1990s classic as it is ‘ in the national fabric			1
’ before joining the @entity14 last year , mr @entity3 worked with @entity5 on @entity7 sketch show @entity33			1
the show was axed after the 40 - year - old @entity36 joked about the autistic son of glamour model @entity38			2
speaking at a @entity40 event , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i would n’t rule him out			1
he ’s not a pariah			2
look back to the 70s			0
people were kicking in his gates			0
he was doing jokes about the crucifixion and stuff			0
‘ i do think there ’s offensive and horrible and nasty comedy			2
if it ’s not done with intelligence and a purpose then i think it ’s really wrong			2
you ca n’t defend it			0
but i do think @entity5 gives us an alternative view of the world			1
’ mr @entity3 said @entity62 and other social media caused an ‘ added problem ’ when hiring controversial comics , because the @entity14 can not control what they say online			1
but he said : ‘ what i think [ @entity5 ] stands for is a libertarian mindset , not a million miles away from [ @entity14 star ] @entity70			1
his angst and his frustration at the world and at how flawed and imperfect we are is where @entity5 ’s coming from , rather than it dissipating into a nasty diatribe about horrific stuff			1
show was axed after the @entity36 joked about the autistic son of glamour model @entity38 who married @entity80 ‘ this has been lost along the way			0
he is seen as this offence machine			0
this guy who does this horrific offensive comedy			2
’ he added : ‘ nobody has at yet brought forward an actual project [ for @entity5 ]			1
i ’m trying to find the right thing for the right people			0
i do n’t know what @entity5 would go in			2
i need someone to come in with a vision			0
’ asked whether the @entity14 should be more careful than other broadcasters not to cause offence , mr @entity3 said : ‘ offense is subjective			1
if there ’s a purpose or there ’s some satirical intent and it ’s defendable for humour reasons , then of course you ’re going to offend some people			0
' some people get offended by weird things … animal scenes generate the most amount of anger			0
‘ i think when people are offended they are genuinely offended			0
but it ’s just their internal barometer			0
it ’s a subjective thing			0
' if you ’re worried about offending anyone you wo n’t make any comedy			2
’ @entity5 last appeared on the @entity14 in 2009 , when he left satirical panel game @entity115 claiming he was ‘ bored ’			1
earlier this month @entity14 bosses were forced to axe @entity5 from a @entity9 broadcast he caused uproar during his stint at the corporation when viewers complained a joke about the @entity123 was ‘ sexist ’ and ‘ ageist ’ , but the @entity124 decided he had not breached its guidelines and he was not fired			1
earlier this month , @entity14 bosses were forced to axe @entity5 from a @entity9 broadcast after he said he wished the @entity123 had died before the @entity126			1
following his comment about @entity130 ’s son @entity129 and a series of offensive jokes about the @entity133 , @entity7 bosses ruled out the possibility he would return to the channel			2
mr @entity3 also revealed he hopes absolutely fabulous star @entity136 is writing more episodes of the classic sit - com , following a one - off @entity139 special last year			1
he said : ‘ the door ’s always open for more @entity29			0
@entity29 is in the national fabric			0
' the door is wide open			0
she probably is n’t [ writing more now ] but we want her to be			0
