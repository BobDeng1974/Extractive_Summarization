by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 perused social media and the television sports bulletins on wednesday night and was aghast at what he found			1
there , he was described as having said @entity7 and @entity8 were washed up , and their day had come and gone			1
which was , quite frankly , a travesty			0
asked a straightforward question about the absence of the two superstars from the @entity14 for the first time since 1992 , he gave a typically straightforward answer			0
‘ they ’re just getting older , ’ he responded			0
‘ @entity7 is 43 or whatever he is ( he is 44 ) and @entity8 is nearly 40			1
so they ’re getting into the sort of last few holes of their careers			2
’ @entity2 defended comments he made about @entity8 and @entity7 given @entity7 has been a pro for 23 years and @entity8 for 19 , it seemed a statement of the obvious , albeit a candid one			1
but do we want all players just to speak in stock cliches and say nothing ? thank goodness @entity2 did not feel the need to backtrack on @entity33			2
he was just anxious to clear up any misconceptions			0
‘ got a question today about @entity8 and @entity7 , ’ he tweeted			1
‘ gave an honest answer , was very complimentary about the 2 best golfers of this generation …			0
golfers on average have a 20 - 25 year career , both into the back 9 of their careers …			2
do n’t think there is anything wrong with saying that			0
but the resultant palaver was hardly the ideal preparation before beginning his mission to win the @entity14 , the @entity52 , and their bountiful joint rewards of $ 11.44million			0
@entity2 spoke about @entity55 @entity7 's problems with arthritis but said he meant it respectfully @entity2 commented that golfers ' careers last 20 - 25 years and they were getting to the end of theirs			1

@entity2 defended comments about @entity8 and @entity7
@entity2 said pair were in ' last few holes of their careers '
@entity72 number one said he had not been *disrespectful*
