arrest : former @entity2 da @entity0 said he wanted to arrest @entity3 - but there was not enough evidence the former district attorney who decided not to charge @entity3 with rape today revealed to @entity8 that he wanted to arrest the star - but had insufficient proof			1
@entity0 was the @entity1 of @entity2 at the time that @entity12 claimed @entity3 , now 77 , drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his @entity14 home in january 2004			1
miss @entity15 , a former director of operations for @entity19 's women 's basketball team and college basketball star , launched a legal suit against @entity3 , a man she called her ' mentor ' , in march 2005			1
she was the first - and only woman - to press charges against the comic legend			1
and today , mr @entity0 , who is now @entity2 commissioner , told @entity8 exclusively : ' i wanted to arrest @entity3 because i thought he was probably guilty , but being able to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking he 's probably guilty are two different things			2
' we knew back then that other woman had come forward , but even if they did it did n't mean anything for our case as none of those cases resulted in charges and were remote in time			2
' commissioner @entity0 , a former two - term da of @entity2 and a private lawyer at the @entity43 law office of @entity44 and @entity45 , added : ' the lady who was allegedly attacked waited a year before she reported it			2
as a result of that delay , any possible corroborating physical evidence was unavailable to us			0
' we could n't test for hairs , fibers , dna and drugs in her system that might match those at mr @entity3 's house			2
we did n't have any corroborative evidence			0
she claimed in court papers she was attacked by @entity3 at his @entity64 home in 2004 - having previously considered him a friend and mentor post-traumatic stress disorder : @entity12 , former director of operations for @entity19 's women 's basketball team , sued @entity3 for rape in 2005			1
they settled out of court in 2006 ' impish ' : @entity73 host @entity72 said that when he asked @entity3 about allegations of sexual assault , the star - joined by his wife of 50 - years @entity77 - shook his head , wagged his finger and gave an ' impish , delightful ' smile ' ' there was almost no evidence on which to base a criminal case			1
the lady could not remember what happened with any detail , and she did n't report it for a year , all this made the case very difficult			0
' i thought the failure to report the alleged incident would create a high hurdle to jump over			0
it was not like she could say what happened			0
' in her civil suit , miss @entity12 , now 41 , said she first met @entity3 , a @entity19 alum , in november 2002 and the pair became friends			1
she considered him a ' mentor ' and was a frequent guest at dinner parties at his home			0
however , in court papers , she claims that after arriving at @entity3 's house on an evening in january 2004 , the comic legend gave her three blue pills when she said she was stressed over work , which he described as ' herbal medication ' to help her relax			1
then , the suit states , her ' knees began to shake , her limbs felt immobile , she felt dizzy and weak , and she began to feel only barely conscious			0
' alum : @entity3 poses with cheerleaders at the @entity115 of @entity116 at the @entity117 of his alma mater , @entity19 , in december 2004 - a month after his alleged assault on @entity12 at his home in @entity64 , @entity14 sports fan : @entity3 takes up the trumpet as he joins the @entity124 band before the start of the first game of the @entity127 in march 1996 , in @entity128 , @entity129 @entity3 then gave her another drug , she said , and led her to the sofa , where she says she was sexually molested			1
' when @entity137 awoke , her clothes and undergarments were in disarray , ' the suit said			0
miss @entity12 later returned to her native @entity139 , where she reported the incident to police in january 2005			1
authorities in @entity2 , @entity14 , followed up with an investigation , but in february 2005 , they declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence			2
commissioner @entity0 said : ' all she could say is that she was there ( at @entity3 's house ) and then something might have happened due to how she was when she next remembered something			2
' i also knew she had a civil court remedy with a much lower standard of proof , and in fact , she had initiated such a case			2
' so this lady was going to get a measure of justice in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower : just more likely than not that @entity3 had done it			1
50 per cent plus a tiny bit			0
a far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which , essentially , is just shy of proof beyond any doubt			0
as a result of the alleged incident , miss @entity12 claimed she had suffered ' serious and debilitating injuries , mental anguish , humiliation , embarrassment , physical and emotional upset , including , but not limited to , post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , sleeplessness , isolation , flashbacks , anxiety , the full extent of which injuries are not yet known and some or all which may be permanent in nature			1
' the suit also said she had been ' caused to suffer and continues to suffer severe emotional distress , humiliation , embarrassment and financial loss			0
' miss @entity12 sued @entity3 for more than $ 150,000 in damages			1
thirteen other women were claimed to be supporting witnesses in her suit and she settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006			1
today , miss @entity12 declined to comment when contacted by @entity8			1
however , she seemed to make her feelings clear on the overwhelming publicity surrounding @entity3 and his alleged sexual offences			2
she tweeted a saying from dr @entity205 : ' my heart goes out to you : be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind do n't matter and those who matter do n't mind			0
' statement : @entity3 , pictured in april , broke his silence amid the allegations of sexual assault on his website			1
the post thanked fans for their ' outpouring ' of support paid out : @entity3 and @entity12 came to an out of court settlement in 2006 when asked about the rape charges by @entity226 host @entity72 last week , @entity3 - joined by his wife of 50 - years @entity77 - shook his head , wagged his finger and gave an ' impish , delightful ' smile			1
a day later the comedian 's lawyer called the charges ' discredited ' and said the ' fact that they are being repeated does not make them true			0
the star would not ' dignify ' the allegations with a response , he added			0
. ' he would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that , at age 77 , he is doing his best work			0
there will be no further statement from mr. @entity3 or any of his representatives			2
' however , this was later taken down and today , a joint statement from @entity250 , counsel to @entity12 , and @entity252 , counsel to @entity253 was posted on billcosby.com saying : ' the statement released by mr. @entity3 's attorney over the weekend was not intended to refer in any way to @entity12			1
' as previously reported , differences between mr. @entity3 and ms. @entity12 were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of mr. @entity3 and ms. @entity12 years ago			1
neither mr. @entity3 nor ms. @entity12 intends to comment further on the matter			1
' keeping quiet : @entity12 declined to comment on the latest allegations of sexual assault made by women against @entity3 support : @entity12 has been posting a series of supportive messages on her @entity267 feed @entity268 , a former publicist , is now the latest to accuse @entity3 of rape , claiming he assaulted her on two occasions in 1969 , when she was 19			1
@entity268 wrote an essay for @entity272 , published on sunday , saying that she felt she could not come forward because @entity3 was idolized - but said she was going public in the wake of accusations made by other women			2
' i thought nobody would believe me because of his image , you know , whiter than snow , ' she told @entity282			0
allegations : @entity284 claims years of hell at the hands of @entity3 and @entity284 , who last month described her years of hell at the hands of the comic legend exclusively to @entity8 , is now asking him to acknowledge her claims			1
she said : ' i understand why more women have not spoken up			0
but my plea is that any women sexually abused by @entity3 come forward now and speak out			2
you have an obligation to survivors			0
if you do n't speak out , you 're helping no one , including yourselves			0
if nothing else , do n't you deserve closure yourselves ? your daughters are not immune to this if we all stay silent			0
what kind of message are we sending to our own children ? ' ' this is why i 'm speaking out			0
would n't you like your daughters to learn how to stay safe from sexual predators ? that 's why i 'm pushing so hard			0
' @entity3 has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him .			0
