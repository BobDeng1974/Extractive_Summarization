with her glossy , chestnut ponytail swishing to and fro , i spotted her furtively racing down the sparkling new @entity5 shopping aisles , her slim , manicured hands greedily fumbling towards the coffee pods and water crackers			1
here was the undisputed yummy - mummy queen of my son 's little local public school , trying to go unnoticed			2
with a look as determined and stealthy as the engine of her $ 70,000 @entity15 parked outside , this was clearly a ' shop - but - for - god 's - sake - do n't - be - seen ' mission			1
in their on - going bid to boldly wade into a market dominated so long and loudly by @entity24 and @entity46 , @entity5 are purposing wooing more and more middle - class @entity36 through their doors			1

yes , you read it right - that 's $ 5.3 billion for a supermarket so weird and wonderful that somehow you can easily emerge with a $ 6 hula - hoop for your pre-schooler when all you went in for was a sandwich loaf			1
but what was remarkable was how by 9.20am this morning each one of the 136 parking spaces were filled outside the new store on @entity105 , @entity28 , near the uber - wealthy neighbouring suburbs of @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
putting @entity5 's latest shopping experience to the test , @entity110 sent me to do a shop here to see if this new store will get me hooked , knowing that i can be a snobby beast when it comes to food shopping			1
the new @entity5 store in @entity28 was reviewed by @entity120 bananas were $ 1.81/kg cheaper at @entity5 compared with @entity24 but some basic items at @entity5 were a little more expensive including long grain rice which was $ 2.99 for a 2kg bag while at @entity24 it was $ 2.29 because , i have to be honest , my previous experiences of @entity5 stores have n't always been a delight			1
for a start there are no free carrier bags , no brands that i 've known and loved all my life ( e.g @entity135 and @entity136 ) and you are most definitely not allowed to pack your shopping at the check out			0
do n't even think about it ! in the past , it 's at this point i usually weep silently , wishing i 'd just re-mortgaged the house and shopped at @entity145 where you float off feeling like a better person - not a mother slipping towards the edge of sanity			0
but the first thing that strikes me as i walk into the doors of this flagship new store , is the sense of space			0
yes , @entity5 have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last			1
whisper it quietly , it 's almost @entity159 - like			0
these were the products at the @entity5 store that were price matched			1
the @entity5 total came in at more than $ 20 less compared with the same shop at @entity24 after doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at @entity5 totalling $ 74.13 , @entity18 then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest @entity24 at @entity168 , @entity28 , where the exact same items came to a whopping $ 96.77 in comparison ' the store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads , using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags , ' said @entity18 you can see what their game is , in their bid to get fussy mums like me onside , with their organic ranges , exposed pale wood beams , jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre ' @entity192			1
' well done @entity5 , for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards , are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down			1
let this be your future			0
and of course for savvy middle - class shoppers , feeling the strain of the increasing costs of housing and basic utilities , it 's all about the cheaper price points they boast about			0
but are their claims really true ? it is , as it turns out			0
after doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at @entity5 totalling $ 74.13 , i then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest @entity24 at @entity168 , @entity28 , where the exact same items came to a whopping $ 96.77 in comparison - by only using either their own brands or the cheapest on offer			1
' well done @entity5 , for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards , are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down , ' said @entity18 most fresh fruit came in cheaper at @entity5 when compared to @entity24 while some items such as plain flour , bread , milk and tins of baked beans were in some cases exactly the same as @entity5 , it was in the meat and cheese aisles where @entity5 won handsomely			1
infact , there was a total saving of $ 22.64 by getting my basic items from @entity5 which is a saving of a huge $ 1.117.28 over a whole year			1
that 's a decent mini-break in a luxury hotel in my book			0
take that mr @entity245 ! it 's not surprising @entity5 plans to continue to try and take over the world , with their 9,600 stores in 18 countries			1
they are investing between $ 400 million and $ 450 million in @entity89 and between $ 200 million and $ 300 million in @entity252 over the next few years with the first stores in the states to open in 2016			1
' everything we do is designed to enable @entity36 shoppers to live richer lives for less , ' an @entity256 spokesperson told @entity110			1
' yes , @entity5 have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last , ' said @entity18 @entity18 found that it was more than $ 20 cheaper to shop at @entity5 compared to @entity24 for the same items ' in their bid to get fussy mums like me onside , with their organic ranges , exposed pale wood beams , jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre ' @entity192 , ' said @entity18 ' @entity36 have come to love the business model of @entity5 , now they have had a taste of what we can offer			1
' the store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads , using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags			1
ok so yes , @entity24 and @entity46 stores are full of famous brands and they pack your bags for you			2
( which is life - saving if your toddler is crying			0
) and you do n't get tempted to buy a laptop with your washing up liquid			0
but as i spied the school yummy mummy speeding off in her @entity15 from @entity5 , i knew one thing for certain			2
she may try to deny it			0
but she 'll be back for the cheap free range chicken at least			0

@entity5 opens it 's latest $ 6 million store in one of @entity20 's most exclusive beach suburbs , @entity28
@entity110 *writer* @entity305 puts the brand and prices to the test
@entity5 vs @entity24 : @entity18 saved a total of $ 22.64 at @entity5 for same items
that 's a saving of a huge $ 1.117.28 over a whole year
