it has n't moved in three years , but the symbolic @entity2 's minute hand could be about edge closer to midnight			1
the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) will host a live international news conference on thursday to reveal its latest decision regarding the minute hand of the clock			1
the last time the clock 's minute hand was adjusted was in january 2012 , when it pushed ahead one minute , from six to five minutes before midnight			1

the @entity4 has said it will host a live conference tomorrow to reveal the @entity18 's decision regarding the clock 's minute hand the conference will begin at 4pm gmt ( 11am est ) on 22 january 2015			1
it is expected that key topics to be discussed at the event will include evidence of accelerating climate change , terrorism and nuclear modernisation			1

this graphic from last year 's @entity65 ( @entity65 ) report shows observed examples of climate change worldwide the decision to move the minute hand of the @entity2 is made by the @entity4 's board of directors in consultation with its @entity71 , which includes 18 @entity72			1
the clock has become a universally recognised indicator of the world 's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons , climate change , and emerging technologies in life sciences			1
since it was set up , the hand on the clock has moved 18 times , and each move represents how the scientists view the world 's chances of survival in the face of these threats			2
this graphic details key changes and movements of the minute hand on the @entity2 since 1947 2012 : five minutes to midnight @entity95 minutes to midnight 2007 : five minutes to midnight 2002 : seven minutes to midnight 1998 : @entity96 minutes to midnight 1995 : 14 minutes to midnight 1991 : 17 minutes to midnight 1990 : 10 minutes to midnight 1988 : @entity95 minutes to midnight 1984 : three minutes to midnight 1981 : @entity97 minutes to midnight 1980 : seven minutes to midnight 1974 : @entity96 minutes to midnight 1972 : 12 minutes to midnight 1969 : 10 minutes to midnight 1968 : seven minutes to midnight 1963 : 12 minutes to midnight 1960 : seven minutes to midnight 1953 : two minutes to midnight 1949 : three minutes to midnight 1947 : seven minutes to midnight source : bulletin of atomic scientists when the hand was moved to five minutes to midnight in 2012 , the @entity4 said it believed the world had entered a ' second nuclear age '			1
the first nuclear age ended with the signing of the @entity106 in 1991 by the @entity107 and @entity108			0
however , according to the @entity4 , both countries have more than 26,000 nuclear weapons combined , that could be launched at a moment 's notice			1
at the time , the @entity4 criticised nuclear watchdogs around the world for failing to take a stand on these weapons and national policies			2
