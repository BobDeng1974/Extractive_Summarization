@entity95 officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on @entity1 , despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack			1

a theory has been that @entity95 hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of the interview , starring @entity109 and @entity110 as tv reporters hired by the @entity112 to assassinate @entity113			1
yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code - sharing site @entity116 demanded @entity1 ' stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war ! ' @entity123 reports that investigators have traced the attack last weekend back to the @entity62 hotel , a five - star resort in @entity66 's capital			1
authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel , simply used the wifi in the lobby , or routed the traffic through the hotel			0
the luxury resort has rooms starting at $ 250 per night , going up to the penthouse suite , which features a private pool and a personal butler for $ 10,600 a night			0
the attack on @entity1 may have been the result of the studio producing ' @entity145 , ' which is a comedy about an assassination attempt on @entity95 leader @entity113 @entity95 has already reacted angrily to ' @entity145 , ' which stars @entity109 and @entity110 the @entity62 is owned by @entity148 , a @entity150 - based company that also owns @entity151 , @entity152 and the @entity154 hotel chains			1
the @entity62 , a glittering high - rise hotel , is located on @entity156 in a section of @entity62 known for its high - end boutiques for the likes of @entity160 and @entity161			2
sources tell @entity123 that forensic evidence indicates that the @entity1 attack was carried out by the same hackers who pulled off the @entity168 cyber assault of @entity170 banks and media companies in 2013			2
the @entity168 hackers were linked to @entity95 , which employs at least 5,900 hackers - many of whom operate outside the country , where electricity is unreliable and internet access is scarce			2
