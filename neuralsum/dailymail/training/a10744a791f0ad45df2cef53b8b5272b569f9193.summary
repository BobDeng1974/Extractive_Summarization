@entity0 has hit back at critics of @entity2 and blamed the media for trying to create divisions between him and club managers			1
@entity2 was rested for @entity8 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity9 last month after telling @entity0 that he was tired in a training session			1
but @entity0 says that the @entity12 forward has been unfairly treated , and that there have never been any club vs country disputes while he has been @entity8 manager			1
@entity8 manager @entity0 addressed the @entity17 on wednesday @entity8 sit top of their 2016 @entity20 qualifying group , with @entity0 having overseen a 100 per cent record @entity0 spoke to young journalists from the @entity17 newspaper before his speech the @entity8 boss was incensed with people attempting to create a division between him and @entity2 @entity0 speaks to @entity2 before @entity8 's meeting with @entity9 @entity0 spoke from behind a lectern and addressed the crowd of students who were in attendance @entity0 ( left ) was in attendance on sunday as @entity2 impressed at @entity35 ‘ with young @entity2 this week , it guts me to see that sort of treatment , ' @entity0 told students at @entity17 on wednesday night			1
' it ’s totally unfair and totally wrong			2
‘ it ’s suiting people ’s agendas			2
but , you know , he ’ll be stronger for it			2
‘ is that right ? of course it ’s not right ! but i ca n’t turn the clock back , i ’m living in 2014 , i ca n’t go back to @entity50 ! ’ @entity0 was also adamant that he had not been involved in any arguments with @entity12 manager @entity52 , and blamed the press for ‘ trying to drive wedges ’ between the managers			1
‘ there is no tension with @entity52 , ’ @entity0 told members of the @entity57 at the end of a talk about his philosophy of leadership			1
' we get on very well			2
‘ i ’ve been very fortunate that , in two - and - a - half years i ’ve not had a single situation where a manager has tried to drag a player out of the team , or told me that they do n’t want their players to take part			1
' i think a lot of the players , if their manager said , “ i do n’t want you to play for @entity8 ” , the player would say , “ i ’m sorry , i love playing for @entity8 and i want to go			1
” ‘ @entity52 and i have always got on very very well since he took the job at @entity12 , so there ’s no problem at all			2
the @entity8 manager has defended @entity2 , claiming the media treated the winger unfairly @entity2 faced perhaps his hardest test against @entity85 giants @entity84 on wednesday ‘ and @entity86 has come out and said that on my behalf as well			1
“ i ’ve been lucky			2
i think there have been club vs country conflicts in the past , but i ’ve been pretty shielded from it luckily			2
‘ journalists would like more conflict , because they work in a slightly machiavellian situation			0
' so when there is just the simple situation – the simple situation of a player asking to be excused from a training session the day before a game because he was feeling tired			0
‘ i said , “ no problem with that , in which case i wo n’t start you , but thanks for telling me ” ‘ they do n’t want that , that ’s too simple			0
‘ unfortunately , that ’s how simple it is			0
he did n’t say he did n’t want to play the game – he played the game , 25 minutes			0
‘ journalists are always going to try and drive wedges between managers			0
’ @entity2 tries to break his way past @entity115 but it was a frustrating first half for him at @entity117 @entity119 criticism unfair - @entity52 @entity0 also said he is ‘ daring to dream ’ of @entity121 success , but that realistically the tournament could be too soon for the current generation of @entity8 stars			1
‘ i ’m hoping that what we ’re doing today , and have been doing for the last couple of years really , will provide the cornerstones for this future generation			0
‘ i ’m obviously hoping that in two years time , we ’ll have got the experience , we ’ll be in superb form and we ’ll race through to become @entity133 champions			0
‘ but realistically it might take longer than that			0
‘ we ’ve got plenty of players who can win games off their own back			0
i was at @entity12 against @entity35 , @entity2 won the game off his own back in the last 10 minutes , because players could n’t deal with him			0
@entity8 overcame @entity9 , and @entity0 is daring to dream of success at @entity121 ‘ in the past we ’ve been well organised , solid , hard to beat			1
but if you can be solid and hard to beat , and add the @entity145 , the @entity146 , the @entity147 , the @entity148 , the @entity149 , you ’ve got a chance			0
so we ’re daring to dream			1
' @entity0 later apologised for not including his captain @entity151 in that list of game - changers , but said the @entity155 striker , who will be 30 by the time the tournament begins , was a crucial player for @entity8 , who @entity0 knows he can trust			1
‘ the one thing i ’ll tell you about @entity151 , he ’s a very passionate person about playing for @entity8 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s a super professional , and the one thing i know i ’ll get from @entity151 , is that i can trust him			0
‘ if i say to him , “ @entity151 , this is your job today , i ’d like you to fulfill this role ” , he ’ll do it			0
and that ’s a great a quality for a player to give a coach			0
