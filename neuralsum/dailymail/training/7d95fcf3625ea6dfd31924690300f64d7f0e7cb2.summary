by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 said today that he believed he had the ' blessing of police ' when he intercepted voicemails from @entity7 's phone hacker @entity2 believed he had ' the blessing of the police ' to legally hack the voicemails of missing schoolgirl @entity7 , the @entity8 heard today			1
@entity2 , who was paid £ 100,000 - a - year by the @entity12 , says he believed the tabloid was trying to find the 13 - year - old using her mobile and pin number given out by @entity18 detectives			1
arguing why he should not be jailed when he is sentenced along with @entity19 and three others on friday , @entity2 thought he was the police 's ' lead eye ' and did not believe hacking voicemails was illegal			1
' he understood the objective was to find @entity25 , who by then had been missing for over two weeks ' , said @entity26			0
' he was led to believe his work on the case had the blessing of the police and he was fortified in the belief because he was working for a large news orginisation			2
' his taskers , he was aware , had close connections with the police , and they had provided him with @entity37 's mobile number and pin number he believed had been provided to them by police officers			2
' mr @entity41 added : ' he believed he acted with lawful authority in intercepting the answerphone of @entity7 with the full knowledge and authority of the police			0
' he believed he had been appointed lead eye , and was proud to be so highly regarded by hiis taskers and the police			0
' @entity2 was tasked on the @entity25 hack by chief reporter @entity51 , and named news editor @entity52 and another executive			0
' he was not aware of any suggestion a story would be published in connection with the interception of @entity7 's voicemails ' , he added			0
' he thought the information would be given to the police			0
' the court heard that former editor @entity19 and three of his most senior staff ' utterly corrupted ' the @entity12 at the highest level and presided over phone hacking on an industrial scale			1
@entity19 , 46 , had denied plotting to hack phones between 2000 and 2006 but was found guilty following a marathon @entity8 trial which went on for 139 days			0
today , he was joined in the dock by three ex-news editors - @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity73 - and private investigator @entity2 who all pleaded guilty to phone hacking before the trial began last year			1
@entity52 , @entity81 , @entity73 , @entity51 , and private detective @entity2 ( left to right ) facing jail : @entity19 was convicted last week and told that he faces up to two years in prison they now face up to two years in jail for their part in the plot which the prosecution said involved a veritable ' @entity89 of @entity90 ' having their private lives invaded through voicemail interception			1
previously , the @entity94 had insisted phone hacking was the work of one ' rogue reporter ' , @entity97 who was convicted of phone hacking with @entity2 in 2006			1
prosecutor @entity99 said : ' anyone who has ever suggested or believed or been told that phone hacking that was revealed in 2006/7 was the work of a single rogue reporter needs to look carefully at this dock in which there are four employees of the @entity94 and only one of them can be described as a reporter , @entity51 who was chief reporter			1
' he went on : ' the newsdesk editor job was described as being the hub or engine room of the paper therefore all of these four defendants can be described as highly paid and influential employees of a national newspaper			0
' between them these defendants utterly corrupted this newspaper which became at the highest level a criminal enterprise			2
' this was systemic misconduct approved and participated in by the editor himself			0
' mr @entity126 told the court that hundreds of high profile individuals had been targeted by @entity2 and the @entity94 journalists but the full extent of hacking may never be known			1
in the dock : @entity2 , @entity81 , @entity51 and @entity52 ( top left to bottom right ) will be sentenced along with @entity19 on friday			2
they were at the @entity8 today for legal arguments over the years , @entity2 had been paid around half a million pounds by the @entity94 to hack phones at the request of the newsdesk executives , the court heard			1
of @entity19 's former colleagues , @entity52 was the most heavily implicated and made some 1,500 taskings to @entity2 between 1999 and 2006 , some even after he had left the newspaper			1
on july 21 2004 , he asked @entity144 to target @entity146 publisher @entity145 over her involvement with former home secretary @entity148			0
he and @entity51 were also responsible for instructing @entity2 over the @entity7 hacking in 2002 , the court heard			2
in all , @entity51 's name appeared on 261 pages of @entity2 's notes , mr @entity126 said			0
@entity73 was the least involved in the plot			0
his name appeared on just 157 pages of the private detective 's notes			0
@entity73 , @entity159 and @entity51 were all involved in targeting another former home secretary @entity160 over a false rumour he was having an affair			0
in april 2006 , @entity2 was overloaded with hacking work , mistakes were made and the @entity94 plotters started ' turning in on themselves ' , mr @entity126 said			1
by then , the prosecutor said : ' it is apparent from his notes mr @entity19 himself became a victim of his own conspiracy and others were also hacked			0
' mr @entity126 went on to apply for costs			0
the total cost of the hacking trial was around £ 1.7 million but the elements of the case which led to convictions for phone hacking was around £ 750,000 , the court heard			1
it came as @entity19 and former @entity12 royal editor @entity97 were told they face a retrial over claims they agreed to buy two royal phone books from corrupt police officers			1
last week the hacking trial jury failed to return verdicts on whether @entity19 , 46 , and @entity97 , 56 , conspired to commit misconduct in a public office			1
@entity19 was back at the @entity8 today and faces up to two years in jail when he is sentenced for his hacking conspiracy prosecution on friday			2
reaction : @entity19 , pictured today , and fellow defendant @entity97 , last week , face a retrial after the hacking jury failed to decide if they had conspired to bribe police for royal phone numbers prosecutor @entity99 said today : ' the @entity200 has taken the position to proceed with the retrial			1
' last week @entity203 was humiliated after speaking out about @entity19 's conviction while the jury was still deliberating on the conspiracy charges he and @entity97 face			2
justice @entity207 said he was ' very concerned ' about the comments the prime minister made after his former spin doctor was found guilty of plotting to hack phones at the @entity12			2
the prime minister also said that @entity19 had lied to him , which was ' capable of affecting mr @entity19 's credibility in their ( the jury 's ) eyes ' , the judge said			0
@entity19 , of @entity218 in @entity219 , already faces jail after the jury found him guilty of plotting to hack phones at the @entity94 between 2000 and 2006 following the @entity8 trial which went on for 139 days			1
@entity97 , of @entity224 , @entity18 , pleaded guilty to phone hacking in 2006 and despite admitting his activities were more extensive than he had previously said , he will not face any further legal action over it			2
lawyers are expected to mitigate for the defendants before mr @entity207 hands down sentences on friday			0
