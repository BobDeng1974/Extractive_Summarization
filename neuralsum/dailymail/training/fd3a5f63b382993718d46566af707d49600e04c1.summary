it 's been a crazy few months since i last checked in on my @entity2			2
i was n't selected for 3 metre individual despite making all the pre-requisites and retaining a spot in the top two for @entity8			2
i really fancied my chances at a medal here , especially after a strong performance at the @entity13 back in 2012 , but for some reason they decided to put in for another event			1
i was selected for the 1 metre , which is n't what i usually do , but blessed with the opportunity to compete i gave it my best shot			0
we now live and train together in @entity31 and we had the determination and the belief that we 'd be on that medal podium - and it paid off			1
my family , my girlfriend , management the team were there , and it felt great having @entity8 behind me			0
after narrowly missing out on a medal at the @entity44 , it was insane to walk away with a gold medal this time round			1
the end of august is always downtime			0
a bit like our summer holidays			0
it 's five weeks where we can do what we want , eat what we want and we usually keep as far away from water as possible			0
i took this time to really push my music			1
i had a couple of gigs across the @entity57 , including one in @entity58 which some of the team came along to watch , and then i headed out to @entity61 with a few of my best mates			1
i 'd always wanted to experience the music scene out there			1
i had the opportunity to watch @entity67 and a few other huge influences and generally just chill out			0
@entity20 poses for a picture during his trip to @entity71 during his summer break from diving @entity20 poses outside the @entity74 in @entity75 before helping promote the relationship between the @entity57 and @entity75 in sport , culture and music as well as funding the @entity83 athletes , every week @entity81 players raise more than Â£ 33million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grassroots sports clubs and facilities			1
find out where your money goes at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk i teamed up with the guys at @entity93 too			0
they hosted an incredible evening of live music , cocktails on the beach and it was so nice to meet some of my music heroes			2
after that , i headed out to @entity75			1
diving is a massive sport out there and a large number of my followers on social media are out there , so with a few dj sets booked across the country we headed out on a tour			2
insane white beaches and beautiful weather - it reminded me a bit of @entity118			2
we then headed down the coast to @entity121			0
here we visited a theme park called @entity123			2
the park is essentially a beginners guide to @entity75 all in one park			1
beautiful wildlife roams the park			0
shows and spectacles , underwater natural rivers you can swim in , shark encounters , beaches and museums			0
if you 're ever in the south of @entity75 it 's a must ! the rest of the trip was an amalgamation of gigs , press and media , orchestrated by the record label i 'm working with - @entity148			1
we spent a lot of time in @entity151 , where i collaborated with the @entity74 on a project to promote the relationship between the @entity57 and @entity75 in culture , sports and music			1
i also had the first radio play of my debut single , hung out with some fans , ate an awful lot of @entity75 food and drunk a little bit of @entity163 too			1
my favourite place was a beautiful city called @entity166			0
we then flew on to @entity71			1
i 'd heard loads about it , but knew within about five minutes of being out of the airport that i would live there some day			0
@entity20 poses at @entity172 theme park in @entity75 in a picture posted to his official @entity175 account there 's such an incredible buzz about it , beautiful weather , an amazing sports and music scene and i met some great new friends			1
since then it 's been a bit of a reality check			0
as you can imagine the first few days back at training hurt so much but i 've got a new weights plan , @entity190 and i are learning some new dives and i have some new focus for my individual work			1
we 're really starting to look ahead to @entity195 now that the @entity44 have been and gone			2
preparation for next year 's season is well underway too			0
there 's plenty of travelling involved , which is made possible by @entity81 funding			0
it 's tiring but an insane experience to share with the team			0
away from the pool , awesome things are happening with my music and i ca n't wait for you to hear some of my stuff in the coming months .			2

@entity20 won gold in the 3m synchronised diving at the @entity3 in @entity25
he then *enjoyed* a five - week break where he visited @entity61 , @entity75 and @entity71 to relax and promote his music
@entity20 is now back in training as he looks ahead to the @entity217
