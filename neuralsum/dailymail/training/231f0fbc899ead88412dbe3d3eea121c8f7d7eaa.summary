by @entity0 and @entity1 women soldiers could be allowed into frontline combat roles , it was announced yesterday			1
signalling the historic change , defence secretary @entity5 said it was time for the @entity8 to abandon the ‘ macho ’ image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough			1
he said the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should @entity18			1
@entity18 defence secretary @entity5 pictured with chief of the general staff sir @entity20 who has also backed the move but last night some former soldiers criticised the ‘ politically correct ’ announcement , saying it should not be considered a ‘ right ’ for women to fight on the front line			1
one said the mixture of men and women could undermine the cohesiveness of units – putting lives at risk			2
@entity35 killed in action @entity35 , 24 , who trained with prince @entity37 , was killed by a roadside bomb in @entity39 in 2007 women can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics , intelligence specialists , artillery spotters , logisticians or signallers			2
however , they remain barred from all infantry battalions and @entity50 units – including @entity51 – and from tank regiments and other armoured units			0
theoretically , women would be allowed to join the @entity51 , such as the @entity55			2
but to do so they would be expected to pass the unit ’s gruelling mental and physical selection process			0
‘ there is no way we are going to make the tests easier , ’ said a defence source			0
the ban has not stopped women being killed in @entity66 and @entity67 where they are at risk from roadside bombs even away from the frontline			1
eight women have been killed in combat in the conflicts – 2 per cent of the total fatalities			1
among the women who have been killed serving in @entity66 is a friend of prince @entity37			2
@entity77 , 24 , a second lieutenant attached to @entity78 the @entity79 , trained alongside prince @entity37 at the @entity80 , @entity80			0
mr @entity5 said yesterday that he had brought forward a planned review – to be carried out by the chief of the general staff – of whether women should be able to join the infantry and the armoured corps			1
it will coincide with what could be the first year that @entity18 troops have not been engaged in fighting somewhere in the world since at least 1914 following the withdrawal from @entity67			0
by january next year there will be fewer than 500 troops in the warzone , mainly in mentoring or advisory roles			1
when @entity18 forces pull down the @entity98 at @entity99 , it is likely to signal the end of a century or more of unbroken warfare for @entity18 forces			2
if the review backs women on the front line , the @entity103 would be expected to make the necessary changes – such as reforms to living quarters – as soon as possible			1
no timescale for the first women on the frontline has yet been set			0
lieutenants @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the @entity119 mr @entity5 said : ‘ at a time when the @entity13 , the @entity15 , the @entity14 , even the @entity122 – the @entity123 of course for years – have women in their combat arms , this is something we have to look at again			1
’ he acknowledged that the demands of frontline combat may mean that only a limited number may meet the rigorous fitness requirements for some posts			0
‘ i am looking for a way forward that signals the @entity103 ’s openness to all who can meet the standards required , maintaining combat effectiveness and militarily necessary standards of fitness , ’ he said			1
but colonel @entity141 , who led @entity18 troops in @entity67 , said : ‘ the infantry is very different from any other job			0
‘ the essence of infantry soldiering is to close with the enemy and kill him face to face with bullets , bayonets and grenades			0
facing and killing a large and aggressive male enemy soldier – if necessary in hand to hand combat – requires a certain ferocity , aggression and killer instinct that is more characteristic of men than women			2
‘ fighting and killing an enemy in close combat is not a right nor an “ opportunity ” as the defence secretary suggests			0
it is a dreadful , gut - churning , traumatic and incredibly tough job that must be done to defend the country			0
‘ the politically correct view that men and women are the same and equally capable of every human activity is a dangerous notion when applied to close infantry combat			2
’ major @entity173 , who retired from the @entity103 in 1986 , opposes close combat roles for women			1
‘ we have to accept that we are different physiologically , ’ she said			0
‘ we do n’t have the same upper - body strength			0
