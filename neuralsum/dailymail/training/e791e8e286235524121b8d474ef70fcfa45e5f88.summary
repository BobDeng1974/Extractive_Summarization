by @entity0 and @entity1 the cost of @entity4 ’s ‘ failed ’ war on terror in @entity6 and @entity7 has reached almost £ 30 billion			1
despite the high cost , the interventions have been branded ‘ strategic failures ’ by a respected defence think - tank			2
toppling @entity7 dictator @entity12 helped radicalise young @entity13 in the @entity4 and far from reducing international terrorism , the @entity7 war ‘ had the effect of promoting it ’ , according to the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
horror : a @entity4 soldier , his clothes on fire , jumps from a tank in @entity23 , @entity7 , in 2005 critics said the cost of the 2003 invasion of @entity7 and sending thousands of troops to @entity28 in @entity6 in 2006 - around £ 30billion and 627 lives lost - was simply not worth the results			1
the @entity31 first revealed last month that the authoritative study , @entity32 , estimated the cost of military operations since the @entity36 as high as £ 72billion			2
the study calculated the cost of @entity4 military interventions after the collapse of @entity40 , from the first @entity41 in 1990 - 91 to the ongoing conflict in @entity6 and @entity43 training missions last year , from @entity46 freedom of information responses			1
the bill for military action in the past 24 years was £ 34.7billion			0
the sum is enough to pay nearly 5,000 nurses or police officers for their entire career , or fund free university tuition for all higher education students for a decade			0
this included £ 20.6billion in @entity6 and £ 9.6billion during the @entity56 - 84 per cent of the total			1
another £ 1.5billion was spent in @entity58 and £ 1.1billion in @entity59 on peacekeeping missions and £ 238million on the war in @entity62			1
the bill for military action in the past 24 years was £ 34.7billion			0
the figures do not include what the @entity64 would have been spending on their normal running costs such as training exercises , fuel , accommodation and pay			2
the study also estimates another £ 30billion may have to be spent on long - term care for war veterans and compensation payments for deaths and injuries could add another £ 7billion - bringing the total cost to £ 71.7billion			1
in the study , military analysts said the @entity4 had succeeded in six out of ten major military operations - but failed in four			1
interventions in the first @entity41 , @entity80 in 2000 and the start of operations in @entity6 in 2001 which drove out @entity83 and the @entity85 leadership were among those praised			2
but the @entity4 failed in @entity58 in the early 1990s , the 2003 invasion in @entity7 , the deployment of troops to the insurgents ’ stronghold of @entity28 and the air strikes in @entity62 which helped oust @entity93 but fuelled a brutal civil war			1
@entity18 ’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the @entity7 deployment			0
it said : ‘ far from reducing international terrorism ... the invasion had the effect of promoting it			0
‘ the rise of @entity103 ( @entity103 ) was a reaction to this invasion , and to the consequent marginalisation of @entity7 ’s @entity108 population			0
the cost of the 2003 invasion of @entity7 and sending thousands of troops to @entity28 in @entity6 in 2006 comes to around £ 30billion ‘ today , @entity103 and other radical jihadist groups stretching across the @entity7 - @entity114 border , pose new terrorist threats to the @entity4 and its allies that might not have existed , at least in this form , had @entity12 remained in power			1
’ sir @entity119 , former senior security and intelligence adviser to mr @entity121 , said that the term ‘ @entity123 ’ may have ‘ helped to create the sense of an inevitable conflict between the west and the world of @entity128 ’			0
however , he said @entity4 was now a safer place than at the time of the september 11 attacks on the @entity132			0
the study said military action in @entity7 and @entity6 had dented the reputation of the @entity64 and reduced the appetite for further overseas interventions			2
the failure of @entity139 to vote for operations against @entity114 last year took place ‘ in the shadow of @entity7 ’ , said @entity18			0
an @entity46 spokesman said : ‘ over the last 13 years the international military campaign in @entity6 has reduced the terrorist threat from this region and helped train a 350,000 strong @entity147 who now have lead security responsibility for @entity6 ’s 30 million citizens			0
‘ development and diplomatic activities have also improved the lives of @entity6 people and helped deliver basic needs , such as access to health , education and the opportunity to vote			0
