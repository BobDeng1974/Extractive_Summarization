these days he prefers not to discuss his love of deerstalking			2
but @entity4 still treats pigeons as fair game – and has taken a 12 - bore shotgun out to hunt them near his home , it has been claimed			2
the prime minister even asked @entity12 protection officers to seal off woodland in @entity14 while he took aim , according to a startling disclosure			1
last night animal rights groups reacted furiously to the claims , accusing the @entity10 of killing animals for ‘ sheer pleasure ’			2
mr @entity4 is said to be an expert deerstalker and has spoken openly in the past about his fondness for country pursuits including foxhunting and shooting			1
but since becoming prime minister , he has been less keen to talk about his love of field sports			1
yet when he was missing the days when he could go deerstalking at his father - in - law ’s @entity27 estate , he went out to shoot pigeons in the woods , according to the newly published diaries of @entity52 ’s @entity27 editor @entity51			0
mr @entity51 , who met the prime minister for dinner in @entity54 in february 2012 during the long run - up to the independence referendum , wrote in his diary : ‘ as we ate venison , @entity58 moaned about the fact that he could n’t go deerstalking any more			1
‘ i suppose he does n’t want to hark back to the grouse moor - image days of @entity63 , or to be seen out with a rifle			0
‘ @entity58 says that recently he fancied a bit of shooting , so took his 12 - bore out into a wood near his home and bagged a couple of pigeons			2
it must have been quite a sight – the wood had to be surrounded by coppers with guns			2
whether that was to protect the ramblers from the pm or the pm from the ramblers was n’t clear			0
‘ anyway , he misses shooting / killing things			2
’ prime minister @entity63 - the @entity79 - was a famous @entity80 hunter the then prime minister was often pictured taking part in field sports - including grouse shooting at @entity84 asked if the prime minister owned a 12 - bore shotgun , both @entity85 and @entity12 declined to comment			1
@entity87 , of campaign group @entity88 , said : ‘ this is killing animals for the sheer pleasure of exterminating their lives			0
normally these activities are wrapped up in justifications to do with conserving species , or boosting the rural economy , or species management			0
head stalker @entity99 , prepares to load a freshly shot stag onto a pony at @entity102 in @entity103 on the @entity104 ‘ what makes it all the more nauseating is that he has n’t got the guts to do it openly , because he knows what the political fall - out would be			0
he is trying to distance himself from the “ posh boy ” image			0
’ yesterday mr @entity4 ’s neighbours in @entity14 said they had not seen the pm carrying a shotgun in woodland near his home			1
one woman , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ i have never seen him with a gun under his arm			0
you do hear shots going off from time to time but i think that is mainly the organised shoots			0
’ another neighbour added : ‘ so what if he does ? ’ political commentator @entity128 has described mr @entity4 as an ‘ excellent shot ’			1
he said : ‘ shooting is a form of complete relaxation , and if you are prime minister , and want to switch off , it is perfect			1
’ the pm was a regular deerstalker – where stags are tracked and then shot – and is reputedly one of the few marksmen skilled enough to shoot two beasts in one go using the so - called ‘ right left ’ technique			0
he used to hunt at the 20,000 - acre @entity143 estate on the @entity27 island of @entity28 owned by his wife @entity145 ’s stepfather @entity146			0
he insisted he had not given up the sport because of objections from animal rights campaigners , saying it was the most ‘ defensible ’ field sport because it kept the deer numbers under control			1
in a @entity154 radio interview before becoming @entity10 , mr @entity4 revealed he was taught to shoot rabbits by his father and said he had ‘ always been a country boy ’			1
last year , he dodged a question about hunting by saying he would now ‘ rather go for a walk ’			0
the @entity30 pledged to give the @entity160 a free vote on repealing @entity163 ’s ban on foxhunting – which mr @entity4 also used to enjoy – but it was unofficially shelved in 2011 .			1
