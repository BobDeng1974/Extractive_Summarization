by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 12:36 est , 20 november 2012 a ' dangerous ' paedophile who was jailed after he was caught watching girls at a swimming pool a day after he was released by the @entity4 has today been freed once more - by the same court			1
@entity6 , 31 , walked free in april after appeal judges said his potentially lifelong sentence for child porn crimes was unlawful			1
within 24 hours he was spotted by police watching children play in the swimming pool at @entity13 leisure centre			0
' dangerous ' : @entity6 was jailed for 30 months in august after being caught watching girls at @entity15 , pictured , thereby breeching his sexual offences prevention order he admitted breaching a court order banning him from loitering near places likely to attract children and was jailed for 30 moths at @entity22 in august			1
however , today he was released again after three senior judges at the @entity4 in @entity24 said the prison sentence was ' excessive '			1
mr @entity26 , sitting with @entity28 and mr justice @entity29 , cut the sentence to eight months , allowing immediate release			2
the judge said that , although there was a risk his offending might escalate in future , a sentence ' out of all proportion ' with what he actually did could not be justified			2
@entity6 , of @entity41 , @entity42 in @entity43 , was initially jailed in january 2011 after admitting possessing child and extreme pornography			2
he was found with a cache of 430 images of child sex abuse , 78 of which were at the most depraved level as categorised by police			0
the images included some of surgical procedures being carried out on children ’s bodies and photos of bestiality , the @entity4 heard in april			2
@entity6 was found to be a ' dangerous ' offender , the court in april heard , after he confessed to ' fantasising ' about sexual attacks on children			1
he was given an open - ended imprisonment for public protection ( @entity65 ) sentence last year , designed to keep him behind bars until considered safe for release			2
' ... while the risk of future offending is a factor , it can not justify a sentence which is out of all proportion to what the appellant has done			0
' the @entity4 in april ruled the sentence was ' unlawful ' because he must be punished for what he did and not what he might do in the future			1
the following day he visited the leisure centre despite being banned by a sexual offences prevention order			1
@entity6 was followed and monitored by 17 police surveillance officers			0
on @entity87 footage , he can be seen paying particular attention to a girl of about nine as she walks past and watching a children ’s swimming pool through a window			0
giving the judgment today , mr @entity26 said @entity6 had a ' long - standing and disturbing ' sexual interest in young girls , but had not been in trouble for contact offences			1
the judge who sentenced him had been influenced by a pre-sentence report suggesting that @entity6 was ' extremely dangerous ' , based on other allegations			0
appeal : judges at the @entity4 , which sit at the @entity104 , pictured , in @entity24 , said the sentence was ' excessive ' but he had not been prosecuted for those allegations and did not accept them to be true , meaning he should not have been sentenced on the basis of them , mr @entity26 said			1
he added : ' [ @entity6 ] must be sentenced for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty and , while the risk of future offending is a factor , it can not justify a sentence which is out of all proportion to what the appellant has done			2
' in this case , what the appellant has done is relatively modest			0
it was a single occasion			0
it did n’t involve contact with any child			0
' it occurred in a public place where the children were accompanied by their parents and were under supervision			0
' we have no doubt that the sentence passed in this case was excessive			0
' the sentence was reduced to eight months , but due to 124 days already spent in custody , @entity6 was eligible for immediate release .			1
