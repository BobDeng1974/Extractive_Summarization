the will it blend ? campaign has destroyed iphones , paintballs and even a bottle of @entity5 but its latest video takes the experiment to another level			0
host @entity9 put a string of magnetic toys known as @entity12 inside a blender			1
as the blades hit the strong magnets , sparks are seen flying through the blender and smoke turns the air inside it black			1
they were blended by @entity26 ? host @entity9 from @entity28 - based blender firm @entity27 ( pictured ) buckyballs are made from a rare earth element called neodymium			1
a typical magnet is formed when unpaired spinning electrons line up to a magnetic field			0
in a neodymium atom there are seven of these unpaired electrons around each atom , and when it is used with in an alloy with iron and boron , for example , a small powerful magnet is produced			1

between 2009 and july last year , more than 1,700 swallowing incidents were linked to the high - powered magnets			2
the manufacturer recalled the balls in 2012 and offered full and partial refunds			2
buckyballs are no longer in production , and federal law in the @entity68 bans them from being sold			0
in the video , mr @entity9 blends the balls for almost a minute			1
sparks begin to fly within seconds , and gradually make the blender glow a bright orange			2
at the end of the video , mr @entity9 tips the balls out in a solid black lump			1
he also describes how much dust was produced by the blending			0
professor @entity82 , head of @entity83 at the @entity84 told @entity85 : ' the sparks are caused by frictional heating , just as for a screeching brake			2
' the hard blender blades strike sparks as they cut into the metal balls			1
' the metal fragments are strongly magnetic so stick to each other forming a solid mass at the end			2
' the reason that sparks are produced is particularly down to the fact neodymium oxidises in air			2
as @entity103 , professor of physics at the @entity105 , explained : ' in fact , neodymium and similar metals are the basis of of flints			0

he also describes how much dust was produced by the blending ' hence if you chip bits off , they ignite in air			0
' as the blending goes on further smaller fragments are produced and the temperature goes up creating more sparks			0
' will it blend ? is a viral campaign designed to promote @entity27 's range of blenders			0
since 2006 , mr @entity9 has blended marbles , golf balls , light bulbs , iphones and @entity136 , glow sticks and a @entity139 doll			1
he has been criticised for the dangerous stunts , and all videos are caveated with a ' do not try this at home ' warning			0

the manufacturer recalled the balls in 2012 and offered refunds professor @entity82 continued : ' the most remarkable thing about the video is the cavalier attitude with respect to the toxic rare - earth metal smoke			1
' even if they have good reason there is no way anyone should do this without using safe ventilation equipment and a way to confine and collect the smoke			0

the strong magnets , known as @entity12 , are made using neodymium
it is a rare earth element often used in an alloy with iron , for example
the @entity12 were blended by @entity26 ? host @entity9
sparks are seen flying around the blender as the balls hit the blades
the balls are then *emptied* from the blender in a solid black lump
