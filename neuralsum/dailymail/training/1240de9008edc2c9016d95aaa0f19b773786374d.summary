by @entity0 published : 13:52 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 13:52 est , 10 april 2013 researchers have made a major breakthrough in the search for treatments for degenerative illnesses such as @entity6 's and @entity7 a major breakthrough has been made by researchers seeking treatments for degenerative illnesses such as @entity7			0
researchers at the @entity13 have detailed how an enzyme in the brain interacts with a drug - like lead compound for @entity17 to inhibit its activity			1
the team said their findings demonstrate that it can be developed as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity17 's , @entity6 's and @entity24 's			1
working with colleagues at the @entity26 and the @entity27 in @entity28 , the researchers identified the molecular structure of the enzyme kynurenine 3 - monooxygense ( @entity31 ) , which is found in the human brain			1
it took five years for the team to establish the crystal structure of @entity31 - the first time it 's ever been done			1
the scientists , who published the research in the journal nature , then studied how the compound @entity41 binds tightly to the enzyme to act as an inhibitor			2
previous studies with animal models of neurodegenerative disease have showed that switching off the enzyme activity through drug binding should be effective in the treatment of brain disorders			1
study leader professor @entity50 said : ' @entity51 works very well as an inhibitor of enzyme activity			0
' however , in its current form it does not pass into the brain from the blood			0
' the search is now on for related compounds that can both inhibit the enzyme and pass into the brain			0
' the team said their findings demonstrate the enzyme can be developed as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity17 's , @entity6 's and @entity24 's ( file picture ) he added : ' our research detailing the molecular structure of the enzyme now enables a search for new @entity31 inhibitors that are able to cross the blood - brain barrier			1
' this provides real hope for developing drug therapies to target neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity17 's , @entity6 's and @entity24 's diseases			1
' dr @entity78 , the team 's neurogeneticist from the @entity26 , said : ' this is a big move forward for the development of new @entity31 inhibiting drugs			0
' unlocking the crystal structure of @entity31 is a real boost to our efforts to find treatments for this devastating disease ' - professor @entity89 ' it is hoped that such compounds may ultimately be tested in clinical trials and prove beneficial for patients			0
' the findings from the research will now be used in the search for more effective treatments for @entity17			2
professor @entity89 , head of the @entity17 's disease research team at @entity100 's @entity99 , said : ' unlocking the crystal structure of @entity31 is a real boost to our efforts to find treatments for this devastating disease			2
' it provides a solid basis for the optimisation of inhibitor drugs like @entity51 that are being developed by the global @entity17 's disease research community			2
' @entity31 is one of our top drug targets , and the crystal structure is a significant step along our roadmap to clinical trials of @entity31 inhibitors in patients			0
' @entity119 , chief executive of the @entity120 , also welcomed the findings			0
she said : ' this research is a really exciting piece of the jigsaw that enables us to understand a little more and takes us a step closer to being able to provide an effective treatment for @entity17			1

researchers discover enzyme in brain inhibits activity of drug - like lead compound for @entity17
team say findings demonstrate it can be developed as effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases
took five years for the team to establish a *crsytal* structure of the enzyme for the first time ever
