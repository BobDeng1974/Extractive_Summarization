pressure : @entity1 is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote - rigging @entity1 is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote - rigging after a cache of emails appeared to implicate @entity7 in thwarting the original inquiry			1
around 1,000 emails handed over to police allegedly show union bosses conspiring to subvert the @entity13 investigation into the selection of its parliamentary candidate in @entity17			1
last night there were renewed calls – including one from @entity21 leader @entity20 – to re-open the inquiry			2
conservative mp @entity23 has also written to police asking them to re-open their own investigation into the affair			2
the emails include messages from @entity30 , chairman of the @entity31 , who is also a @entity7 boss at the @entity33 oil refinery			1
mr @entity30 was at the centre of the @entity33 closure last week after @entity7 threatened strike action over his suspension from the firm			1
@entity39 suspected mr @entity30 of spending company time on party business rather than industrial relations			1
the emails , published in the @entity44 , will embarrass mr @entity1 , who cleared mr @entity30 of wrongdoing and reinstated him to the party in the autumn			2
mr @entity1 dropped the inquiry after four witnesses , members of a local family called @entity51 , withdrew their claims of vote - rigging			1
but the emails revealed that mr @entity30 himself had approved their retractions , which were drawn up by lawyers acting on behalf of @entity7			1
one email sent by @entity59 , a @entity7 executive , said that the union should draw up ‘ statements on behalf of the @entity62 rebutting allegations in the report as to what they are alleged to have said ’			1
mr @entity30 wrote back that he was ‘ happy ’ with the draft adding : ‘ get this to the @entity51 family and get this posted tonight ’			0
@entity7 has denied having any ‘ inappropriate ’ contact with witnesses and said it dealt with them through ‘ external solicitors ’			2
another email also reveals a plot to try to drag former prime minister @entity77 into the affair by getting him to lobby mr @entity1 to drop his argument with @entity7			2
dispute : his suspension had previously triggered a dramatic stand - off , culminating in the shock closure of the petrochemical plant ( pictured )			2
this was only reversed at the 11th hour after the union backed down mr @entity59 wrote : ‘ we will prepare for an approach to @entity77 wherein we ask @entity77 to consider the potential damage this could do and request @entity92 do contact @entity93 in private			0
’ one email also appears to threaten to launch a smear campaign , with an official saying : ‘ @entity97 [ the pr team ] will prepare the nasty stuff we know of individuals in the @entity13 but this will not be used			0
’ mr @entity1 ordered an investigation into the selection process this summer following claims @entity7 had tried to pack the @entity106 constituency with its own members to get @entity108 selected			1
mr @entity1 last night signalled he could re-open the investigation			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 thinks if there is any new evidence , then he will be happy to examine it			0
’ the spokesman added that throughout mr @entity1 had acted swiftly to launch his initial inquiry			0
@entity21 leader @entity20 said : ‘ if there is any new details that are as grave as is being suggested then of course there should be a new investigation			0
’ @entity23 , @entity121 mp for @entity122 , also wrote to police formally urging them to re-open their investigation over ‘ potentially fraudulent behaviour ’ by @entity7			1
@entity121 chairman @entity127 said : ‘ @entity21 must re-open the @entity17 inquiry			0
@entity1 failed to stand up to the unions in @entity17 and backed down in the face of pressure from [ unite general secretary ] @entity132			0
’ the local mp @entity133 , who is standing down at the next election following a drunken commons brawl , joined calls for a new probe			0
he said : ‘ @entity21 must re-open inquiry into @entity17 immediately			0
local @entity21 members are outraged that @entity30 remains @entity140 [ chairman ]			0
’ @entity7 said the claims against it over the selection process had been ‘ entirely unjustified ’ and neither the law nor the party rules had been broken - claiming ' the email exchanges do nothing to change that ' .			1
