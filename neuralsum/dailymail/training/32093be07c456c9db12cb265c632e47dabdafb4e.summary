for most athletes at the @entity3 , their battle starts when they take their place on the starting blocks			1
but for @entity6 and @entity7 , just taking part in @entity9 felt like a gold medal victory			1
to reach the @entity12 , they have had to overcome political , social , religious and sporting obstacles			2
the @entity16 judoka @entity6 , who was embroiled in a political and religious row in her home country before being allowed to compete the 100m sprinter @entity19 of @entity20 runs in a hijab and long clothing to conform with @entity24 modesty laws @entity26 's olympics lasted just over a minute this morning , but the fact she made it to her bout with @entity31 's @entity30 meant it was a revolutionary moment for the women of @entity16			1
the country 's ultra-conservative clergy tried to destroy her ambitions to be @entity16 's first female olympian , before an argument about the type of headscarf she should wear jeopardised her place at the eleventh hour			1
and though @entity20 's @entity7 trailed in last in the 100 metres - in a time of 14.42 seconds - the warm appreciation of the @entity9 crowd who recognised her historic feat must have been the greatest of feelings			1
she has suffered months of harassment from men who do n't believe women should be permitted to play sport			0
both have made a strong statement to the people of their respective countries and the world with their determination to take part and their dignity			0
as did @entity61 , only the fourth female athlete from @entity62 to enter the @entity3 , who lasted just a dozen strides before pulling up injured in her 100m heat			1
the record books will show @entity67 - did not finish - but they were significant strides			0
@entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 from @entity71 are unlikely to trouble the favourites for gold , but as they sprinted down the track in the @entity77 wearing colourful hijabs there was a sense of progress			1
the @entity3 ended in disappointment for @entity61 of @entity62 , who pulled up shortly after the start of her 100m heat @entity83 ( @entity84 ) of @entity69 certainly stood out on the starting blocks with her hijab and top in national colours @entity6 , just 16 , comes from @entity16 , a country of @entity89 where women are banned from driving and can not leave the house without a male chaperone , let alone compete in the biggest sporting event in the world in front of millions around the world			1
she had been rocked by the barbs of the country 's clergy , who strongly discourage female participation in sport in any form and labelled her the ' prostitute of the @entity3			1
' her family have been bombarded with racial abuse , according to reports , with many trying to claim @entity6 did not represent their country			1
there was then a row which threatened to end her chances once and for all			0
her national @entity114 said she could only compete if she was wearing a hijab - a hair covering worn by many @entity118 women			1
but judo 's governing body was worried that a head covering could be dangerous in the grapples and tumbles of the sport			2
@entity6 , @entity16 's first ever female athlete , squares up to @entity31 @entity30 in their first round bout , which lasted just over a minute @entity7 looks at the scoreboard after her 100m heat , though her time of 14.42 seconds meant she finished last in the standings @entity6 was powerless - a political pawn - as negotiations went backwards and forwards between the two until a compromise was reached			1
and so she strode out - a little tentatively but energised by cheers from the @entity136 crowd as loud as any reserved for home athletes - wearing a tightly - wrapped black headscarf			2
but there was another problem - @entity6 is only a blue belt , two below her opponent @entity30 , and the outcome was inevitable			1
a little later , @entity7 lined up in heat four of the women 's 100 metres			1
alongside her were competitors from @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity152 - countries smaller than @entity20 but light years ahead in terms of sporting equality			1
the 23 - year - old raced in a headscarf in the national colours of red , green and black , and a rather impractical outfit of long - sleeved top and jogging bottoms			1
but the wall of noise @entity7 experienced in the @entity77 was in stark contrast to the whistling and heckling she received on a daily basis from dozens of men while training at the stadium in @entity169			2
they would shout ' just be in your house ' and ' be behind your man ! ' as she raced up and down the track , honing her technique			0
her coach would often have to quite literally fight his way through the crowds afterwards			0
@entity7 was warmly received by the crowd at the @entity180 as she lined up for her heat this morning after the race , she said : ' i faced a lot of challenges in my training for the @entity3			1
' one day i was coming to the stadium and the taxi driver asked me where i was going			0
i said ' i am training , i am going to @entity3 ' and he said ' get out of the cab , i do n't want to take you there '			2
' whenever i train there 's a lot of people who want to disturb me			0
they say ' just leave these things , it 's not good for @entity20 females to do these things '			1
' although her time was nearly four seconds slower than @entity204 's world record of 10.49 seconds , @entity7 had some powerful words to her fellow countrywomen			1
' i have a message for the women of @entity20			2
come and join @entity209 because i need your support			0
' we must be ready for the next @entity3 , we should have more athletes in the next @entity3			2
i 'm going to do my best to be in @entity214 , i am going to give reason for other athletes to follow my way			0
' it was n't so good for @entity219 , @entity62 's first female olympian , whose hours and hours of training and preparation resulted in just a couple of seconds in the @entity114 spotlight			1
wearing a maroon headscarf , long sleeves and leggings , she stood out among the starters			0
she was slow out of the blocks , appeared to be very tight , and finally clutched at her right leg before stopping after about 15m			0
it was a similar story for the others , who were n't close to qualifying for the next round			0
contrasting cultures : @entity69 's @entity83 ( @entity237 ) and @entity71 's @entity238 walk off the track with @entity241 's @entity240 but as @entity114 spokesman @entity242 said : ' if someone 's injured then they are injured			1
she is here and she is competing			0
' i think we should be celebrating today because we had two athletes from two of three countries who had never sent women athletes to the @entity12			1
' last but not least : @entity256 's @entity255 crosses the finish line of a women 's 400 - meter heat they say it ’s the taking part that counts			2
in which case , @entity256 runner @entity255 did her country proud in the women ’s 400m yesterday – even though she finished nearly half a minute after the winner			2
@entity255 , 21 , is one of only two @entity256 athletes at the @entity12 – each nation is eligible for two guaranteed places , one male , one female – and she was her country ’s proud flag - bearer at the opening ceremony			1
yesterday , dressed in a @entity118 - suitable track outfit designed to cover most of her body , she gamely took on some of the best in the world – and lost			0
winner @entity277 ( @entity279 ) finished first in 50.78 seconds			2
@entity255 came last with a time of 1min 20.48sec , with the next - to - last competitor a good 25 seconds ahead of her			2
many in the crowd at the @entity77 appeared to assume the race was over , not realising that @entity255 had yet to amble across the finish line			0
but her performance did n’t go unnoticed on the internet , where she became the subject of ridicule , in some cases , and admiration in others			0
one wrote : ‘ can i just give a big shout to @entity294 for being my favorite @entity256 woman ever			0
’ but another said : ‘ @entity255 , you can not run ! you suck			0
’ @entity256 ’s determined @entity114 hopefuls have overcome challenges in their war - torn country that few other athletes encounter			2
training facilities are virtually non-existent and those that do operate are often pock - marked with bullet - holes			0
a @entity308 official said recently : ‘ the security situation has hampered our efforts , and the resources we have had to prepare the athletes were unspeakable			0
‘ but i can assure you that our athletes are strong in spirit			0
’ @entity255 was n’t the only 400m runner to fail to break the one - minute barrier yesterday			0
@entity320 ’s @entity319 finished in 1min 5.37sec , while @entity322 ’s @entity321 clocked 1min 0.86sec .			0
