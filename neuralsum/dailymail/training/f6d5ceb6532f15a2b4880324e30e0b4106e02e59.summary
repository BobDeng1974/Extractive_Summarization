@entity0 , 12 , @entity1 , 7 , and @entity2 , 9 , do not understand the simple pleasures of an ordinary childhood			2
they do n't go to school or visit friends , even kicking a football around the garden is out of the question			0
instead the youngsters have spent their entire lives locked inside their home in the @entity15 village of @entity16 , 76 miles north of the capital @entity18 , prisoners of a family blood feud which makes it too dangerous for them to venture outside			0
prisoners : @entity0 , 12 , ( left ) @entity1 , 7 , ( centre ) and @entity2 , 9 , ( right ) have spent their entire childhood locked inside their home to avoid becoming the victims of a blood feud the brothers are among an estimated 900 children who must hide indoors to avoid being slaughtered under the ancient @entity32 code of practise known as @entity34 - which gives a person the right to kill a rival or a rival 's relatives in retribution for an earlier killing			1
killings under the @entity34 are known as @entity44 or blood - taking , and are similar to the @entity46 tradition of vendetta			1
the practise is said to date back to medieval times although some historians say they can trace its origins to the bronze age			1
home life : @entity1 entertains himself inside his spartan bedroom in the @entity15 village of @entity16 , 76 miles north of capital @entity18 tradition : the @entity34 is an ancient @entity32 code of practise that gives a person the right to kill a male member of an offending family in retribution for an earlier killing it applies to both @entity68 and @entity69 and regulates all aspects of life including crime , family , marriage , transfer of property , damages as well as personal and social conduct			1
it was virtually stamped out under @entity80 but has since returned as @entity81 struggles to emerge as a modern and prosperous democracy , with many claiming to hold no faith in the current legal system			0
although the blood feud killings are known to date back to the @entity88 , many of the ' rules ' have not been adapted to modern times , often they can continue until every male member of the families are dead			0

in a bid to help trapped children like @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity81 's education ministry organises teachers to visit three times a week , for ten hours a week so they can at least receive an education			1
deputy education minister @entity119 told setimes : ' we assist by sending in teachers of the school closest to the child 's residence			0
' in most cases , we prefer teachers who have taught these children before , when they normally attended the lessons			2
teaching in these conditions entails difficulties , but teachers try to do the best for these children			2
