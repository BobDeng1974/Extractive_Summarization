a group of wildlife watchers scan the open ocean for activity - as a huge whale drifts just below them			1
these amazing images show a 50 - tonne southern right whale and its calves swim within touching distance of a small tourist vessel and its crew			1
the massive mammal dwarfs the boat and could easily crush it with one swipe of its 15ft tail			2
breathtaking : a 50 - tonne southern right whale and calves swim underneath a small tourist vessel up close : wildlife photographer @entity19 said the family seemed more intent on making friends monster : a whale watcher ( top right ) swims next to the 50 - tonne whale in the @entity26 , @entity27 but according to wildlife photographer @entity19 - the family seemed more intent on making friends			1
he said : ' being in the water with a whale is the most humbling experience i 've ever had underwater			2
' not only are these animals massive , but they are long - lived , intelligent , cultural beings			2
' swimming along with a curious right whale calf was nerve - racking			1
at any moment i thought ' mom ' was eventually going to get annoyed with me and swat me with her 15ft tail - and i 'd be a goner			0
' yet , with every passing minute we felt more comfortable around each other and they became curious about us and would make closer passes			0
' mr @entity19 said they were so engrossed in taking pictures , they had a few narrow misses with the huge animal			1
he said : ' it actually became quite funny because we would be totally enthralled by the animal , taking pictures of the head and eye as they were swimming by - but then the instant we got past the pectoral flippers it became a mad scramble to swim away from the whale to avoid their tail			1
' at one point , one of the calves was rolling around on top of its mother , upside down , and its tail was raised out of the water			0
powerful : a seagull looks tiny compared to the whale whose 15ft tail could easily crush the tourist boat ' humbling ' : mr @entity19 said : ' being in the water with them is most humbling ' but made sure to avoid its tail here 's looking at you : the photographer got pictures of its head but then it was a ' mad dash ' to get away ' the calf rolled awkwardly off of its mom and slashed its tail to the side to roll itself over and get a breath			1
' the slash of the tail landed in the water just a few feet from me , immersing me in a cloud of bubbles			0
' reality came rushing back and i knew i could n't let my guard down for a second or else risk having a major incident			0
all in all though i knew that if anything went wrong it would be my fault and not the whale 's			0
' the photographs were taken in the @entity26 , @entity27 , where southern right whales head between september and december to raise their offspring			0
the species were often targeted by hunters because their thick blubber made them float to the surface after being killed - making them easy to catch .			0
