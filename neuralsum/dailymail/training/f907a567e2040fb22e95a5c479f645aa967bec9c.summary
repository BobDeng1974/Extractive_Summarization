that ’s how @entity2 views the month ahead for @entity3			1
he is well aware of the profound significance of the next four tests at @entity6 in the run - up to the @entity8			1
the hooker and @entity11 captain knows it is high time that the national team begin to establish a thunderous momentum as they build towards the home tournament which will define their careers			1
@entity18 ’s men must attempt to do so against the might of the @entity20 , while the one encounter with supposedly lesser opposition pits them against @entity23 - comfortably the strongest of the tier two nations			1
@entity3 hooker @entity2 says the @entity27 are a chance to throw down @entity8 gauntlet @entity2 ( centre ) passes the ball during an @entity3 training session as @entity33 last week it has reached a tipping point for @entity3			1
they go into the @entity38 series on the back of a 3 - 0 defeat on their summer tour of @entity43			1
they stood toe - to - toe with the @entity43 but could n’t quite beat them and now @entity48 ’s world champions are the first november visitors , on saturday			1
@entity3 have beaten @entity43 only seven times , with the 38 - 21 win at @entity6 in 2012 standing out as the record victory			1
however , since then @entity3 have lost four in a row against the @entity43			1
the stakes could scarcely be higher			0
no wonder @entity2 sees the four weeks ahead in such stark terms			1
‘ it is getting down to crunch time now , ’ he said			0
‘ we play @entity57 this series and next time we play @entity57 it is going to actually mean something			1
‘ it ’s the same with @entity61 in the @entity62			0
it is going to mean something so it is time to perform			0
performance is the key word — hopefully the result comes with performance but performance is key for this whole series			2
‘ it would be nice to win all four but as long as we are performing and playing well , hopefully results come with that			0
this autumn series is going to be a step up			2
’ after the opening game against the @entity43 come the formidably powerful @entity79 to confront an @entity3 team missing five @entity81 among their tight forwards , a worrying predicament with such a brutally physical contest in mind			1
@entity3 first face @entity8 champions @entity43 on saturday in the first of four autumn tests @entity2 ( left ) dives to make a tackle for @entity11 on @entity92 ' @entity91 in the @entity93 for @entity95 , losing both opening games would be a doomsday scenario , leaving his side on a run of five @entity89 defeats just when they need to be making their hq a place to be feared by all comers			1
at least one win from those two is vital with the bigger picture in mind			0
after @entity23 , the autumn finale against @entity57 will serve as an important dry - run for the same fixture at the same venue in the pool stage of the @entity8			1
that match is about laying down a marker for the main event next year , against rivals who are in a state of flux			0
five months ago @entity3 narrowly failed to undermine the @entity43 ’ global supremacy			1
a weakened team dominated the hosts in their @entity121 stronghold before losing 20 - 15 and a week later in @entity122 , @entity95 ’s team lost by just a point after a stirring fightback			2
in the final @entity3 were routed in @entity126 , but they still had ample cause for hope amid the rubble			1
according to @entity2 , there was further proof that @entity43 are not unbeatable — as @entity132 subsequently proved in the @entity133			1
@entity134 returned to the @entity43 from rugby league in their match against the @entity137 ‘ we take confidence but saying that , those @entity89 were at the end of our season , ’ he said			1
‘ we were a little bit disjointed but that was the first time they had met up			0
it is the other way around now			0
they have been together for two months so they will be a well - oiled machine , but they are not invincible			2
people have run them close just like we did and beaten them			0
’ the grim night in @entity126 is one that @entity2 , who was being watched by members of his family from nearby @entity156 , would like to erase from his memory			1
he added : ‘ i want to forget about it			0
we got caught at the start and gave them three tries in 20 minutes			0
if you do n’t front up early against the @entity43 they are going to run riot			2
ultimately , what sticks in my mind is that we performed really well in the first two games and there is no reason why we ca n’t do that next week			0
’ @entity3 captain @entity170 ( left ) leads newcomer @entity171 ( second right ) at training for @entity3 , one powerful factor which will drive them on this month is the shattering memory of having landmark achievements snatched from them in cruel fashion			2
at the start of last season ’s @entity62 they were closing on victory in @entity182 until a late lapse allowed @entity184 to score the try which ultimately prevented a first @entity187 @entity186 since 2003			0
and in @entity121 , it was @entity190 ’s 78th - minute strike which denied the visitors the famous result that they emphatically deserved			2
those episodes will keep the motivational fires raging			0
@entity2 recognises the power of pain , from his experiences with @entity11			2
‘ if it had n’t been for the last two minutes against @entity199 that competition ( @entity62 ) is completely different , ’ he said			0
‘ experiences like losing in @entity199 and losing at @entity202 in the last few minutes — that can only be good for the team			0
@entity184 scored for @entity199 to deny @entity3 victory in the last minute of the 2014 @entity62 match @entity3 face @entity207 ( centre , charging forward in their tight win over the @entity211 ) and @entity57 in the last autumn test in a @entity6 fixture to be repeated in the pool stage of the @entity215 ‘ at @entity11 we lost three semi-finals , three years in a row , we lost the @entity219 final , we lost a @entity220 final and i got red - carded			1
there are all these team things and these personal things			0
a few of us suffered like that , which is quite nice to have in the back of your head			0
’ next weekend the @entity231 skipper is destined to line up as @entity3 ’s only available first - choice front - rower in the absence of @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			1
@entity95 is also without injured locks @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 and flanker @entity242			0
up front , the @entity244 stocks are depleted but @entity2 believes they are still well - equipped to fight the good fight			1
‘ we are blessed at the moment in the @entity3 pack because we have depth , ’ he said			2
‘ anyone can come in and play			2
look at @entity252 — he has been having a storming season			0
it ’s unfortunate for some lads when they get injured but you need that experience of people playing these games now and being able to fill in if required			0
’ @entity3 are likely to exhaust their reserves over the next four weeks			2
it promises to be gruelling and enthralling and momentous			0
by the end of it , the @entity8 host nation need their @entity264 to be at full throttle , not stalling and in need of a service .			2

@entity3 hooker @entity2 stresses the importance of the *upcoming* @entity27 at @entity6 in the lead - up to the @entity8
@entity244 begin four - @entity89 series against @entity43 on saturday
their last showing against the @entity43 ended in a 3 - 0 series defeat
@entity3 also play tests against @entity132 , @entity23 and @entity57
