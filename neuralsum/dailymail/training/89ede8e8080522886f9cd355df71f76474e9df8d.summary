they are also having to swap their previously lavish private residences for restaurants and commercial outlets in a bid to meet a new entertainment budget			0
the ' low cost ' functions are a far cry from @entity20 's infamous advert , which portrays ambassador 's parties as extravagant , luxurious and ' exquisite ' affairs			1
contrast : @entity20 's ' @entity26 ' advert portrays functions as luxurious and ' exquisite ' affairs the classic ' @entity26 ' advert - which became cult viewing in the 1990s - features an ambassador with ' exquisite taste ' entertaining guests with a pyramid of gold - wrapped chocolates			1
it then sees a beautiful woman taking a chocolate , before declaring in a foreign accent ' @entity40 , with these @entity20 you are really spoiling us '			1
@entity4 diplomats ' more modest functions were highlighted yesterday in a report by the @entity47 foreign affairs committee , according to @entity48			1
the report warns that government cuts to the entertainment budget are affecting morale - with staff also facing a larger workload following the five - year £ 170million savings ordered by a spending review in 2010			1
cost - cutting : @entity4 diplomats are now being forced to host ' low cost ' functions			1
above , the @entity59 although the document does not specify details of the cuts , several regulars on the diplomatic scene have spoken of their experiences of ' low cost ' functions one guest at a high commission party in @entity70 told the newspaper : ' we were told it was a black – tie do , but it turned out to be in a breezeblock building that was the staff bar			2
' i arrived late and was given the last glass of cheap plonk , only for a lackey to then appear and ask to swap my glass with a plastic one because the real ones had been hired and needed to go back			2
' meanwhile , other guests have recalled seeing advertisements for budget airline @entity84 at functions , and being forced to consume ' just about drinkable ' wine			1
dispute : foreign secretary @entity88 ( left ) is continuing to push for the promotion and support of @entity4 business abroad , but sir @entity92 ( right ) has warned the @entity59 is ' being worked to the limit ' the report comes as foreign secretary @entity88 continues to push for the promotion and support of @entity4 business overseas			2
yesterday , sir @entity92 , @entity97 mp and chairman of the committee , said that the @entity59 was ' being worked to the limit '			0
' we have no problem with an active and ambitious foreign policy , but we 're getting a distinct impression that the @entity59 may be trying to do too much , when capacity is limited by a tough spending review settlement , ' he said			0
the cuts have also forced embassies to hire local , cheaper employees - with more junior staff being given the task of entertaining dignitaries			2
this has led to difficulties when hiring venues for functions , as only ambassadors are permitted to rent properties large enough for official entertaining , the report said			0
it added that the hosting of functions at public premises is now considered to be ' the norm '			0
a @entity59 spokesman said : ' the @entity127 ’s annual inquiry into the @entity59 highlights the excellent work the @entity59 is doing in many areas despite government - wide spending constraints			0
' while we continue to face budget pressures we are committed to meeting our planned headcount reduction of 10 per cent by the end of 2015 - 2016			0
' we are mindful of the committee ’s concerns and the need to ensure that we continue to meet ambitious targets without overstretching ourselves			0
' we will look at the findings of the report in detail and publish our formal response in due course			0
