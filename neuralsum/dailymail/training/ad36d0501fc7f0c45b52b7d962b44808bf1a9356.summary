@entity1 gov. @entity0 canceled planned availabilities with reporters in @entity4 on tuesday after his comments on vaccinations sparked a political flap at home			1
the @entity10 governor and likely presidential contender had originally been scheduled to address the press three times during the final day of his three - day trip to the @entity15			1
instead , the availabilities vanished from his schedule , which included lunch with the chancellor of the exchequer and a visit to the famous @entity22			0
' is there something you do n't understand about , " no questions " ? ' @entity0 snapped when a reporter asked whether he 'd discussed the @entity29 group during his meetings with dignitaries during the visit to the @entity22			1
billed as an official trade mission , the trip doubled as a chance for @entity0 , a likely presidential contender , to broaden his foreign policy resume and build relationships with world leaders			1
but coverage of the trip has been dominated by remarks he made monday after touring a pharmaceutical facility , that parents ' parents need to have some measure of choice ' when it comes to whether to vaccinate their children			0
@entity0 's office quickly backtracked , releasing a statement that declared that , ' with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated			0
' but the comments drew scorn , first across social media , and then from medical professionals , newspaper editorial boards and national democrats , who accused the governor of ignoring medical science			2
binders full of @entity15 : @entity91 failed to establish his foreign policy bona fides during a 2012 @entity15 trip , insulting his hosts by suggesting they were n't ready to stage the summer olympics a measles outbreak centered in @entity98 has sickened more than 100 people , focusing attention on parents who choose not to vaccinate their children			1
some do so for religious or philosophical reasons , while others cite a concern that vaccines can lead to autism and developmental disorders â€“ a link debunked by rigorous medical research			0
trips to @entity4 have sometimes been problematic for @entity10 presidential contenders			2
@entity91 , the 2012 @entity10 nominee , angered officials here when he suggested that they were n't prepared for the upcoming olympic games			1
and @entity116 gov. @entity115 stirred controversy in january when he told a think tank audience that some countries allowed @entity120 to establish autonomous ' no - go zone ' neighborhoods in cities where they govern by a harsh version of @entity126 law			0
@entity15 prime minister @entity127 had called such assertions bunk			2
canceled : @entity0 left reporters high and dry on tuesday , replacing open press conferences with closed meetings and events trouble : @entity0 started a national furor on monday with his comments about childhood vaccines nad never managed to escape tough follow - up questions about whether parents should be allowed to opt out @entity0 's final day included a visit to a drug treatment center for women , where he encouraged members of his party at home to show more compassion to addicts , as well as a performance by students studying at the @entity22 , which houses an exchange program with @entity1 's @entity152			1
his original schedule had included two ' gaggle ' opportunities where reporters can ask questions as well as planned ' brief remarks ' after a lunch with @entity45 , the chancellor of the exchequer , outside 11 @entity161			0
the remarks were indeed brief			0
' we had a lot of fun , ' @entity0 responded to shouted questions as he bypassed waiting microphones and marched to his waiting car .			0

@entity1 governor replaced a trio of scheduled open - press availabilities with closed events instead
tuesday was the last day of a tough @entity15 tour that saw him start a national *frenzy* over childhood vaccines
a testy @entity181 *badgered* reporters in @entity4 : ' is there something you do n't understand about , " no questions " ? '
@entity91 met with similar *disaster* during a foreign - policy trip to the @entity15 in 2012 , saying he doubted @entity189 were ready for the olympics
