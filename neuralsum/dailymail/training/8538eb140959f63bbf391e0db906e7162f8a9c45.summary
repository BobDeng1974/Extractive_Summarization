the @entity0 has predicted an @entity2 weather pattern to strike @entity3 this summer , with irregularly hot and dry weather on the horizon			1
@entity2 is a climatic event occurring roughly every five years , which is defined by substantial warming in temperatures of the @entity10 sea surface			1
in @entity3 , @entity2 is characterised by droughts and abnormal heat , particularly in the eastern and coasts of the country , which are already on the grips of a dry spell			1
this week , the @entity0 has raised its prediction of an @entity2 hitting this summer to 70 per cent , up from 50 per cent just two weeks ago			1
this week , the @entity0 has raised its prediction for an @entity2 this summer to 70 per cent large crowds visit @entity24 on february 8 , 2009 in @entity25			1
in @entity3 , @entity2 is characterised by droughts and anomalous heat , particularly in the eastern and southern coasts of the country countries bordering on the @entity10 who rely upon agriculture and fishing are the most affected by @entity2			1
when the conditions last for months , fishing industries can be severely damaged			0
the counterpart to @entity2 , @entity36 , sees temperatures cool to lower than average across the @entity10 , increasing the risk of cyclones and landfalls around the @entity42			1
@entity3 has already had two major heatwaves this spring , while sub-surface temperatures in the central to eastern areas of the @entity10 are already 4 degrees warmer than average			1
the event is largely triggered by changes in the @entity10			2
' we 're seeing very warm temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean , about 1 degree above average , ' said @entity53 , the bureau 's manager of climate prediction service			2
' things seem to have evolved fairly quickly in the last few weeks , ' ' what 's happened is that things have continued to warm up in the tropical @entity10 rather than stay stagnant , and the central tropical @entity10 has reached temperatures that are basically at @entity2 levels now			2
' ' this has a strong impact on temperature			0
october was 2.8 degrees above normal and very dry			0
we 're seeing similar conditions across southeast @entity42 in @entity66 and @entity67			1
simultaneously , there are floods happening in @entity70 , which is the other side of the coin			2
' the event is associated with very wet weather months in april â€“ october along the coasts of @entity76 and @entity77 , giving rise to serious flooding			0
mr @entity53 says the @entity0 used numerous approaches to reach the conclusion			0
' there are five international models which we have used and they come from all over the world ; @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity70 , @entity88 and @entity89 , plus our own model at the @entity0 , which is called @entity91			2
' @entity53 ( pictured ) , the bureau 's manager of climate prediction service , says there are five international models which indicate that @entity2 is on the horizon a map from the @entity0 predicting above average temperatures for summer across all of @entity3 in its latest fortnightly @entity2 ( @entity2 ) wrap - up , the @entity0 has lifted its @entity2 tracking status from ' watch ' to ' alert '			1
' there is enough going on here that is sensible to raise the odds , raise the threat level , because we do n't want people to go without the best information , ' mr @entity53 said the last time we saw similar conditions in @entity3 was in 2012 , and the conditions are looking to be more severe this year			1
according to @entity113 weather agencies , 2014 has been the warmest ever april - september period , posing a serious threat that 2014 could be the hottest year on record			0
at the moment , the warmest year is a tie between 2005 and 2010			0
mr @entity53 warned it can be difficult to classify the event conclusively			0
' the reality is that it 's not like flicking a switch			0
@entity2 is not a sudden change , but rather a gradual progression , ' he said			0
' we are however seeing some telltale signs that these event will be reached by december			0
' warmer @entity10 temperatures combined with cooler seas around northern @entity3 mean there may be fewer tropical cyclones crossing the coast but also fewer tropical rain depressions relied upon by drought - affected farmers in @entity134 , dr @entity53 said			1
' they have already had a couple of bad wet seasons up there so a third one is not a good situation			0
' in 2009/10 there were serious drought conditions across much of eastern @entity3 because of the @entity2 effect .			2

the @entity0 has predicted @entity2 to arrive this summer
the event is characterised by droughts and anomalous heat in @entity3
we have already seen two major heatwaves this spring
@entity10 temperatures are four degrees warmer than average
there is similar conditions in southeast @entity42 and floods in @entity70
