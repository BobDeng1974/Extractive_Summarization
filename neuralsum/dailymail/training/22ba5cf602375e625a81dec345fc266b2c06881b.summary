@entity0 are investing an assault on @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 by a fan during the @entity6 derby with @entity7			1
@entity9 's equaliser for visitors @entity7 saw a fan in the away section run from behind @entity2 ’s goal and push him to the ground			1
approaching from @entity2 ’s left , the thug ran up to him and caught him unawares with a double - fisted blow that floored @entity3 keeper			1
senior investigating officer detective inspector @entity31 said : ' with the public 's assistance we have clearly identified the offender who ran onto the pitch during last night 's game between @entity3 and @entity7 and who is suspected of assaulting the @entity3 goalkeeper			1
' we are dealing with the complaint made by the player and are currently taking statements , collating evidence and making enquiries to locate and arrest the offender			1
' we are also using @entity46 footage from around the ground to identify suspects who may have been responsible for other offences before , during or after the match			0
' the suspect was widely named on social media sites last night , and if it proves to be him , he has previous convictions for football - related violence , and is currently serving a nationwide ban on visiting any football stadium in the country			0
@entity7 manager @entity60 was furious after the match and said he was ' absolutely embarrassed ' by the incident			1
' i thought it was an absolute disgrace , ' he said			0
' i think they should get the guy and prosecute him and put him in prison ' he ( @entity2 ) went down like a ton of bricks but that does n't make a difference			1
nobody should be on the pitch doing that			0
i hope we can make an absolute issue of it			0
he spoiled everything for everyone			0
i 've not enjoyed that when i see a moron like that			0
' i am not proud of being @entity7 manager when i see that			1
i do n't mind the rivalry between us - there was a great atmosphere			0
to see things like that on the field of play there is no place for it - i am absolutely embarrassed			0
' vicious : the fan grimaces as he goes in to attack @entity2 he continued : ' they had enough security			1
' if they have got a person like him with a five - year - old mentality they ca n't stop that			0
@entity3 ca n't do anything about			1
it just gives them more opportunity to have a go			0
' @entity110 ( @entity111 , wednesday manager ) was saying we should n't thank the crowd but our crowd were fantastic but we 've got one moron and i ca n't tolerate that			1
' i 've not seen anything like that since my mate @entity120 got something thrown at him at @entity122 in an @entity124 game many , many years ago			0
all of them apart from one moron were excellent tonight			0
' furious wednesday boss @entity111 described the @entity7 fans as : ‘ @entity129 animals ... an absolute disgrace , ’ and said they should be banned from every away ground			1
there were offensive chants from both fans during the game , about @entity136 from travelling @entity7 fans , with @entity3 supporters singing songs that referenced the two @entity7 fans who were killed in @entity141 in 2000			1
@entity142 ‏ ( @ rioferdy5 ) wow , watching the @entity143 vs @entity7 game ...			1
that fan is a disgrace			2
been a good game too			0
@entity150 ( @entity151 ) wow what have i just seen on my tv ! absolute disgrace			0
# leedsfan @entity155 ( ‏ @ kyle28walker ) the fan could have had anything on him great goal ruined but a silly man			2
these things should happen anymore @entity161 ( @ fizzer18 ) ca n't believe what i 've just seen in the @entity163 wed vs @entity7 game ! @entity165 ( @ themichaelowen ) got to feel for @entity7 fans			1
1 idiot gives the rest of them a bad name			0
same thing happens when a footballer steps out of line			0
@entity174 ( @ @entity175 ) absolute disgrace what that @entity7 fan did tonight			1
i could not believe my eyes			0
@entity2 did well not to retaliate # noplaceforthatinfootball minutes after the full - time whistle , @entity7 released a statement promising to work with the police to identify the man responsible for the sickening attack			1
@entity0 have confirmed in a statement they ' will be working with both clubs to identify and quickly bring to justice the personsresponsible '			0
in his post-match press conference , @entity60 stood by his club 's statement and called on the culprit to be jailed			1
' it 's just so sad and disappointing			0
if anything it stopped us winning the game			0
i thought at 1 - 1 we would get in the driving seat and that made everyone ... for one moron , ' he said			2
' the club has made a statement and i 'm pleased , we do n't condone that			2
i hope the authorities and constabulary take the appropriate action			0
' a spokesman for @entity7 said : ' @entity7 would like to apologise and condemn the actions of the fan who came into the pitch and attacked @entity2			1
the club will fully cooperate with both the police and the football authorities in identifying the individual concerned			2
' having sensed a tense atmosphere in the first half , @entity60 also claimed to have asked police if they wanted him to address @entity7 ' fans in order to calm tempers			1
' there were some early on , they ( the fans ) went towards each other , the police said they did n't think it would be right			1
it looked to me ...			0
i was disappointed in certain aspects of being manager tonight when things like that happen , ' he said			2
' i did say to the police , in the first half , did they want me to go over and calm them down but they said that might inflame it even more			1
' he did not agree with @entity111 ' assessment that he was in the wrong to send his players to clap the travelling fans , though			1
he said : ' i disagree , @entity110 is disappointed with not winning the game			0
i understand his feelings being a manager , it 's a pressure game , he felt they could have won it			2
' @entity7 coming was the best thing that could have happened to him , if it was a lesser team coming , on the run that they 're on , it would have been very difficult , but the crowd lifted them			1
' this incident will be an embarrassment for the @entity124 as it comes three days after their complaint about the unruly and racist behaviour of @entity260 fans , players and officials after @entity264 ’s under 21 victory			2
as @entity2 lay flat out on his goalline , seats that had been ripped out at the away end rained down on to the wednesday six - yard area			1
as the assailant clambered back over the barriers and reclaimed his seat , team - mates and physios rushed to @entity2 ’s aid			2
when he finally climbed to his feet and signalled he was able to continue , he turned to the travelling fans and pointed an angry finger towards them			2
pain : @entity2 holds his face after the incident tension between rival supporters had threatened to boil over minutes earlier , but a flashpoint that involved a shameful physical attack on a player is sure to land @entity7 in trouble with the authorities , who will launch an immediate enquiry into it			1
@entity289 had already made it an uncomfortable return to his native @entity163 for @entity60			1
@entity289 , a deadline - day loan signing from one - time @entity294 boss @entity60 ’s former club @entity293 , steered a 44th - minute header past @entity297 ’s despairing dive to give wednesday a deserved lead			1
wednesday boss @entity111 bemoaned his side ’s recent misfortune in his programme notes , and he had more grounds for complaint as wednesday dominated the first - half			1
third from bottom at the outset , wednesday belied their lowly position with some fluent passing that lacked only a finishing touch			2
treatment : @entity7 fans chant and jeer while @entity2 lies injured how it went unrewarded for so long took some explaining , though , after a remarkable 10th - minute escape for @entity316 keeper @entity297 and a glaring blunder by referee @entity318			1
@entity289 ’s 30 - yard shot almost embarrassed @entity297 but the crossbar came to his rescue after he spilled the striker ’s strike			0
as wednesday continued to press , they were denied a clear penalty when @entity326 dived full - length and palmed away a @entity289 corner with his right hand			2
@entity289 finally made wednesday pressure pay , following a 44th - minute long throw from @entity331			2
the striker rose highest , and though his header lacked venom , it was directed well enough to defeat @entity297 ’s dive			0
ripped down : a sign is torn from its berth at @entity339 as he celebrated the breakthrough , @entity289 appeared to be struck by a missile from the @entity7 end			2
it was not the only unsavoury note of a first half that often threatened to boil over			0
@entity346 was guilty of overreacting after @entity347 barged into him on the edge of the area			0
the @entity7 midfielder went down clutching his face , despite contact appearing to be with his shoulder			2
@entity318 took no action , but may well have punished @entity347 for another flashpoint , when the central defender floored @entity326 with what looked like a forearm smash			0
@entity359 was being barracked more than any of the former @entity294 players on view , and he duly played up to the role of villain in a running verbal battle with @entity318 over a series of decisions			0
but for all the aggression shown on the pitch it is the actions of one crazed individual which will occupy the football authorities as they investigate the end to a troubling week			0
