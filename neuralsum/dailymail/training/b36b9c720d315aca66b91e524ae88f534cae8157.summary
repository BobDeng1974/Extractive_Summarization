@entity1 boss @entity0 believes on - loan winger @entity2 is ' lucky ' that the club are giving him the chance to shine in the @entity6			1
the @entity7 international is currently halfway through a season - long loan at @entity10 having struggled to break through at parent club @entity11			1
the 22 - year - old made a name for himself as a teenager at @entity1 and has started to show his form since @entity0 was installed as boss of the south @entity18 club			1
@entity2 ( left ) is finally enjoying more game time after returning to @entity1 @entity0 ( centre ) is willing to provide a platform for @entity22 to reach his obvious potential @entity0 has led the @entity1 to back - to - back @entity6 victories since his return and the @entity1 ' boss feels his club can provide a platform for @entity22 to continue his development - whereas other promising talent is being wasted on the benches of top @entity6 sides			1
' i 'm not sure about that option , ' @entity0 said when asked if he could make @entity22 's move permanent this month			1
' what i do know is that he 's a player that needs to get his career on the move again			0
he 's had a decent couple of games , made an impact and he needs to build on that			0
i think that is where he 's at			0
he 's a talent that needs to nail down a permanent position here , whether he 's on loan or permanent but i 've been very pleased with what i have seen			2
' @entity22 's only goal since rejoining @entity1 came as a last - gasp equaliser in a 3 - 3 draw against a @entity55 side managed at the time by @entity0			1
@entity22 's only goal since returning to @entity10 was against @entity0 's @entity55 in a 3 - 3 draw the 22 - year - old winger found his options limited on the bench at @entity11 and the former @entity63 boss has challenged @entity22 to show that sort of form once again and add to his two @entity7 caps			1
' he has certainly got the ability , ' @entity0 added			2
' i have worked with players who have fantastic technical ability for the @entity6 but have only ever played in @entity71			0
' all the attributes , you need to have the power , strength , the mental and technical quality to become a @entity6 player			0
' @entity2 has got a lot going for him and he has the potential to have an impact on the international stage at some point			2
i think the opportunities at @entity11 have been limited and that has been a problem			1
' that has been a problem particularly at the top four or five clubs - @entity90 is one of the lucky ones in that he has a platform on which he can play			2
' @entity1 have also taken a chance on young talent by bringing in @entity96 's @entity95 on loan @entity0 would not confirm reports of a january deal for @entity101 's @entity100 @entity0 , who returns to former club @entity102 for an @entity104 fourth - round clash on saturday , has given a similar platform to @entity96 striker @entity95 after bringing the @entity107 forward in until the end of the season			1
he has also been linked with a move for @entity101 's @entity100 but refused to comment on any potential deal - although he did admit enquiries for fresh faces have been made			2
' not that i 'm aware of , ' he said when asked about an approach for @entity100			0
' i think we 've enquired on about three , four or five different players and whether they 're available - that 's really where we 're at			0
' the chairman is pursuing some lines of enquiry in the right manner , in the way it should be conducted			0
unfortunately not in front of the press ! ' i 'm not going to talk about other players at other clubs			0
i do n't think that 's fair			0

@entity2 has returned to his former club @entity1 on loan
the 22 - year - old found his opportunities limited at @entity11
@entity1 boss @entity0 is determined to give @entity22 a platform to shine
