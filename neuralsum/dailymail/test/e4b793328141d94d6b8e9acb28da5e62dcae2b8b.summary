the number of female genital cosmetic operations performed on the @entity2 has risen five-fold in the last decade as women worry they 're not ' normal '			1
labial reduction procedures - surgery to reduce the size of the inner ‘ lips ’ of the vagina - have risen five-fold in the past 10 years , with more than 2,000 operations performed in 2010			1
and the trend is reflected in @entity10 where procedures have more than doubled in the same time period			1
the labia are lips which protect the vagina			0
there are inner labia – the labia minora - which are thinner , and the outer labia – the labia majora , which have more tissue and fat			0
labial reduction procedures - surgery to reduce the size of the inner ‘ lips ’ of the vagina - have risen five-fold in the past 10 years , with more than 2,000 operations performed on the @entity2 in 2010 they naturally vary in size and shape , but some women are dissatisfied or distressed about the appearance of their labia , even when they are classified medically as perfectly normal			1
the surgery involves reducing the size of a woman 's labia minora to make them more symmetrical and smaller than the labia majora			1
this is done by cutting away the ‘ excess ’ skin with a scalpel , or possibly a laser , and stitching up the loose edge with dissolvable stitches , until it heals			0
experts at the @entity44 at the @entity45 in @entity46 , have called for more research to try and better understand women 's motivations			1
a study by the @entity51 explored the views of women aged 18 to 28			1
interviews focused on participants ' views of the ' normal ' and ' ideal ' vulval anatomy , on cosmetic surgery and the sources of information available			1
@entity62 , from the university , said : ' it is essential that doctors do not assume that women have an inherent knowledge of their genitalia and the anatomical terms used to describe it			1
' this contemporary women 's health issue requires further research and interdisciplinary collaboration if we are going to ensure best practice and achieve optimal outcomes for our patients			1
' a labiaplasty is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of the labia minora – the flaps of skin either side of the vaginal opening			0
most labiaplasty operations are done by private clinics as cosmetic surgery , to change the appearance of the female genitals			1
occasionally , there may be a medical need for the operation ( for example , because the tissue is affected by disease ) , in which case it might be covered by the @entity2			1
however , the @entity2 does n't routinely provide this operation			1
it 's natural and normal for a woman to have noticeable skin folds around the vaginal opening and , in most cases , this should n't cause any problems			1
some women are dissatisfied with or distressed about the appearance of their labia , even when they look perfectly normal to the health professional examining them			1
a labiaplasty involves shortening or reshaping the vaginal lips , a bit like shortening a hem on a dress			0
it is usually performed by a gynaecologist or plastic surgeon			1
the unwanted tissue is cut away with a scalpel or possibly a laser , and the loose edge may be stitched up with fine , dissolvable stitches			0
it can be carried out using either a general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic with sedation , and the whole procedure takes about one to two hours			0
however there is a lack of research investigating how effective this procedure is			0
this means there 's no guarantee it will achieve a long - lasting desired effect , and there are short - and long - term risks to consider			1
source : @entity138 the researchers concluded that women would benefit from better access to information showing a range of normal vulval anatomy			1
another study led by the @entity146 examined attitudes to pubic hair removal and the relationship with physical discomfort , viewing pornography , genital self - image and the consideration of labiaplasty			0
the study found no link between the removal of pubic hair and requests for the cosmetic surgery			2
however , the study also highlighted the need for careful recognition among the healthcare profession of the possible reasons for the increase in women seeking surgery			2
@entity169 , one of the researchers , said : ' while women request labiaplasty for physical and psychological reasons , the reasons for increasing numbers of surgeries in the last decade are not clear			2
' research has exposed a lack of education regarding the management of patients requesting female genital cosmetic surgery			2
@entity183 , from the @entity51 , said : ' gps would be greatly assisted by practice guidelines when faced with such requests			0
' if they are able to provide adequate , accurate information to patients , this may prevent unnecessary surgery and alleviate patient anxiety			2
' gps should also consider referring women to a gynaecologist rather than a cosmetic surgeon when they wish to have surgery			1
' the studies highlight a need to improve clinical guidance for healthcare professionals , the experts said			2
and they called for further research around the surgery and patients ' knowledge and perceptions of ' normal ' vulval anatomy			2
meanwhile a consultant plastic and aesthetic surgeon told @entity210 said many of his patients seek the surgery because they suffer problems ranging from pain and tearing to extreme psychological distress			0
mr @entity217 , who works at the @entity218 , @entity219 , said he believes the rise in operations is down to an increase in awareness and availability of the procedure			2
while many people believe these women are simply seeking a ‘ designer vagina ’ , he said most are having the procedure for functional reasons or because they have been traumatised by having labia that are misshapen or low - hanging			2
some will never enter into a relationship for fear of a partner seeing their genitalia , while others can not undress in public or wear a bikini , he told @entity210			0
other women have labia that are so long that horse riding , cycling or having sex is painful			2
‘ one woman was part of the cycling team , she had persistent swelling and chafing			0
it stopped her cycling , ’ mr @entity217 said			0
meanwhile consultant plastic and aesthetic surgeon @entity217 told @entity210 said many of his patients seek the surgery because they suffer pain and tearing and extreme psychological distress there are also women who have torn their labia during intercourse , or while horse riding , which as well as being excruciatingly painful , causes bleeding			2
‘ when women with this condition wear tight clothes , like jeans , they experience chafing , ' added mr @entity217			0
‘ one lady used tampons to keep her labia inside because they were hanging down below her underwear			0
‘ i saw another lady who was getting recurrent thrush as she had all this extra tissue down there that was moist			0
’ his clinic carried out 49 procedures in 2014 compared to 27 in 2013 – an 80 per cent rise - while @entity2 figures show there were 2,000 labiaplasties performed in 2010 – a five-fold rise since 2001			1
many women who come for a consultation with mr @entity217 are so insecure about the way their labia looks it is impairing their life , he said			0
women can be born with naturally long labia or that are shaped in a way that their owners deem unattractive , he explained			0
in some women , they stretch naturally over the course of a lifetime , while others experience stretching or tearing as a result of childbirth , and are embarrassed by the result			0
this is usually due to hormones associated with pregnancy , the stretching of the vagina during the birth or due to the loss of the pelvic floor muscles .			0

@entity2 labial reduction procedures risen five-fold in the last 10 years
more than 2,000 of the cosmetic operations were performed in 2010
trend is reflected in @entity10 with ops more than doubling in same time
experts call for more information to help women understand what 's normal
