by @entity0 gloves that work with touchscreens are n’t new , but they ’re usually sold at a premium and have to be bought separately from your existing gloves			0
a new technology claims to solve this problem by letting you turn any pair of ordinary into touchscreen ones simply by painting the fingertips with a special liquid – it also has the potential to be used with prosthetic limbs			1
called @entity16 , the liquid is made of conductive polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive ' bridge ' between your finger and the screen			1
the liquid soaks into a variety of fabrics and creates a conductive ' bridge ' between a finger and a screen			1
a pack costs $ 20 ( £ 12 ) and is set to go on sale thursday , with international shipping the liquid is made of conductive polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive ‘ bridge ’ between your finger and the screen			1
a patch needs to cover around 1sq inch per fingertip to work , and the liquid dries in about a minute using a blow dryer , for example			0
the liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time varies depending on the thickness of the glove , and the material			0
a blue version is specifically designed to be used on fabrics and other porous materials , while the black version is for more durable leather and rubber gloves			1
the liquid is clear - the colours relate to the packaging they are sold in			0
the system is n’t perfect , though , and the liquid will eventually wear off , and will need to be reapplied			0
@entity69 , founder of @entity16 , said the patch needs to cover just 1sq inch per fingertip to work , and the liquid dries in about a minute using a blow dryer , for example			1
the liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time varies depending on the thickness of the glove , and the material			0
@entity69 , 23 , from @entity79 , @entity80 , said : ‘ i initially intended to use @entity81 with my motorcycle gloves as there was n't a huge selection of touchscreen gloves on the market			2
‘ but i later realised the full potential of @entity16 and all the different applications it can be applied to			2
‘ so far all of the people we have demonstrated @entity92 to were amazed at how well it works			0
‘ a lot of people were sceptical at first but immediately changed their minds once they got to try it out themselves			0
’ a @entity16 pack costs $ 20 ( £ 12 ) but can be used on multiple gloves			1
the black version , pictured left , is designed for use with more durable leather and rubber gloves , for example			1
the blue version , pictured right , is specifically designed to be used on fabrics and other porous materials			0
the liquid is clear , these colours relate to the packaging they are sold in shipping costs $ 3.50 and it is due to go on sale on 20 march.the company does ship internationally			1
the blue version is specifically designed to be used on fabrics and other porous materials , while the black version is for more durable leather and rubber gloves			2
the liquid is clear , the colours relate to the packaging they are sold in			0
the system is n’t perfect , though , and the liquid will eventually wear off , and will need to be reapplied			0
while workers who wear gloves in their daily lives will benefit , the creators also have plans to expand into prosthetic limbs			1
the liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time varies depending on the thickness of the glove , and the material			0
@entity80 inventor @entity69 said @entity138 even works with motorcycle gloves , stock image pictured @entity141 also works with thick workman 's gloves , stock image pictured			0
a blue pack contains enough liquid for up to 15 fingertips , and the black version lasts for up to 30			2
the system is n't perfect , though , and the liquid will eventually wear off , and will need to be reapplied @entity69 said : ‘ we do n't just want to limit it to gloves as we discovered many prosthetic limbs are unable to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices			1
‘ because touchscreen technology is such an integral part of our society , daily interactions for anyone with prosthetic hands becomes a challenge			2
we would like to expand in this field by testing @entity16 on a variety of prosthetics			2
‘ our goal is to give people with prosthetic limbs the ability to easily interact with touchscreen devices			1

@entity16 turns ordinary gloves into touchscreen ones using special liquid
the liquid is made of conductive polyamide that soaks into the fabric
this builds a conductive ' bridge ' between your finger and the screen
a pack costs $ 20 ( £ 12 ) and shipping is *expected* to begin on thursday
technology can be used on *cotton* , wool , latex , rubber , leather and nylon
*researchers* are currently testing the technology on prosthetic limbs
