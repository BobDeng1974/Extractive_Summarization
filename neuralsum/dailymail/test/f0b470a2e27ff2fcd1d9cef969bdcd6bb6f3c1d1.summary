this is the moment a four - year - old girl broke down in tears because the ' little ducks ' in a nursery rhyme did not come back to their mother			2
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , learnt the popular song at preschool and was halfway through eating her dinner when she decided to perform it for her mom , @entity13			1
she starts by confidently singing : ' four little ducks went out to play , over the hills and far away			0
' @entity17 duck says quack , quack , quack , quack , but only three little ducks came back			0
' but as the rhyme continues - and the number of ducks returning to their mother decreases - her eyes begin to fill with tears			1
as she gets to the penultimate verse , where ' no little ducks come back ' , she starts to sob with her arm across her face			1
at the end of the clip @entity31 , who lives with her mom , dad and two - year - old brother , leans in for a hug from her mom - despite being told the ducks do actually return			2
mrs @entity6 posted the video on @entity40 alongside the caption : ' my four - year - old daughter learned a new song at school yesterday and ca n't quite get through it without crying			1
' she gets so sad that the mama duck does n't have her babies ! ! # allthefeels ' the 25 - year - old , who met @entity31 's father @entity51 in 2007 , told @entity52 : ' i filmed the video because after i had picked @entity31 up from school , she would't stop singing it all day and would start to get emotional near the end every single time			1
' i recorded it at dinner time so i could show her dad once he got off from work			2
' she is so caring and loving and , as a mother , it made my heart explode watching her get so emotional about the mama duck losing her babies			0
' i just adored it			0
it makes me happy to know how loving her little heart is			0
