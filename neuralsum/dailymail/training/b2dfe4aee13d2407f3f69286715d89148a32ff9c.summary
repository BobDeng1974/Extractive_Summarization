he ’s making a list , and checking it twice , to find out who has been naughty and nice			0
but @entity3 might also want to jot down a few equations and sums , as he ’ll need to grapple with the laws of physics come @entity8			1
of course , it ’s unlikely @entity3 has to deal with the rules of science in quite the same way as regular people , but he might want to take a glance or two at the task awaiting him on his trip this year			1
calculations reveal the incredible speeds he will need to attain - 3,000 times the speed of sound for starters , assuming that @entity3 does n’t handle certain faiths , he ’ll have about 378 million children to deliver to in a fairly short time frame , according to one scientist			1
thankfully , due to the rotation of @entity35 he ’ll have a good 31 hours to deliver presents - rather than just 24 - assuming he ’s flying @entity37 to match @entity35 ’s rotation			1
with a further assumption of their being 3.5 children in each household , based on the average census rate , that leaves him with 91.8 million homes to visit			0
that means he has 822.6 visits per second to cope with , requiring a stay of about one thousandth of a second to deliver presents to each home			0
@entity54 data storage company @entity52 calculated the disk space required to back up @entity3 ’s list			2
based on the world population data for under - 14s , taken from the @entity54 @entity59 , @entity52 worked out @entity3 would receive an estimated 1,843,868,987 letters this year			1
if each @entity8 letter takes up an estimated @entity62 when uploaded as a scanned copy , it would take up @entity64 of data each year			2
letters from @entity68 's children would take up the most room with @entity70			0
@entity71 comes in second taking up @entity72 and @entity73 sits in third place taking up @entity75			0
the @entity76 comes in at number 32 on the list , taking up @entity79 of data			0
all in all , @entity3 ’s sleigh will need to move about 650 miles ( 1,050km ) per second , which is 3,000 times the speed of sound or 0.35 per cent the speed of light			1
at such a speed it 's possible @entity3 may start to feel the effects of relatiivty , particularly time dilation , causing him to age very slightly slower than the rest of the people on @entity35 - perhaps partially explaining his perpetual ability to deliver presents at @entity8			1
the sleigh will also have a sizable number of presents on board , further complicating matters			2
is each child were to receive a present no more than 2lbs ( 0.9kg ) in weight , the sleigh would still weigh more than 320,000 tons - just shy of the weight of the @entity102 , 370,000 tons			1
an average reindeer on @entity35 can pull only 300 pounds ( 135kg ) , so in this scenario 214,200 reindeer would be needed			0
of course , considering these are flying reindeer , they may well be able to handle heavier loads			0
but with the weight and speed of the sleigh , it appears that the front two @entity116 and @entity117 , until @entity115 ’s inclusion - will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second			2
this will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight			0
the entire reindeer team , assuming only eight are used , would be vapourised in 4.26 thousandths of a second			0
with the weight and speed of the sleigh , it appears that the front two @entity116 and @entity117 , will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second			0
this would generate temperatures far in excess of those experienced by @entity136 's @entity135 on its return to @entity35 friday 5 december ( illustration shown ) however , in rebuttals to miss @entity142 ’s research , other scientists pointed out a few points that might make his job a bit easier			0
@entity147 from @entity148 suggested that @entity3 would n’t necessarily have to visit all 91.8 million homes in one night			2
‘ @entity3 would have to @entity151 a number of packages ahead of time , since he would not be able to fly into @entity156 , or into tower - controlled areas near airports , ’ he explained , so those homes could be subtracted			1
and another unnamed scienist said that such flying reindeer might have more power than we think owing to a ‘ dominant gene sequence within the reindeer dna strand			0
’ meanwhile , last year a team of scientists from @entity168 @entity76 @entity167 and @entity169 said @entity3 would 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies during his journey , if he accepted all the snacks on offer at various homes			1
and the total expenditure on all of the presented needed would be around £ 280 billlion ( $ 440 billion ) - which is £ 30 billion ( $ 47 billion ) more than his home country of @entity180			1
spare a thought for the elves as well ; 3,000 of them need to work eight hours a day around the clock , for the whole year , in order to get enough presents for every good child			2
so however @entity3 plans to get all his presents delivered this year , we hope he ’s taken a look at the science accordingly			1
thankfully , due to the rotation of @entity35 he ’ll have a good 31 hours to deliver presents - rather than just 24 - assuming he ’s flying @entity37 to match @entity35 ’s rotation			1
shown is an illustration from @entity198 blog , which shows the possible path taken by @entity3 around @entity200			0

@entity3 will have to overcome the laws of science when he makes his journey around the world from the @entity22 on @entity8
calculations reveal the incredible speeds he will need to attain
and the force of pulling his sleigh - which weighs almost the same as the @entity102 - will likely vapourise his reindeer
however , one can assume @entity3 has worked out these problems already
he *'ll* still need a good £ 280 billion to *afford* all the presents , though
