but , following a delay for the roof and floodlights to come on , he pegged back @entity17 opponent @entity16 to win the tie 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 1			1

fans , who queued overnight for tickets to see the 25 - year - old in action cheered and waved their @entity62 flags all the way through the night as officials allowed play to carry on just after the scheduled closure			1
council regulations prohibit matches to continue after 11pm but with the win in @entity2 's grasp the game concluded in the nick of time			1
in a bizarre twist to the tie @entity2 was at risk of throwing the match away as he dropped a handful of points after balls , kept in his pocket on his service games , fell out during play			1
a knee injury also seemed to be threatening his push for a fourth round berth , which he had strapped up , but he finally claimed the win			2
as the last @entity8 left in the competition , @entity2 - once again - carries the hopes of the nation on his shoulders			1
outside the packed court thousands of fans have even flocked to ' @entity92 ' inside the @entity56 to watch the @entity93 on the big screen			2
prior to the tie bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning @entity5 from 10/1 to 11/2 , in the wake of @entity99 's elimination on friday			1
and the @entity93 has extra incentive to beat the world number 24 , who knocked him out of the fourth round back in 2006 - the @entity17 is coached by his former trainer @entity104			1
@entity104 , who worked with @entity2 between 2007 and 2010 , has been coaching @entity16 since last summer			1
and he believes his former boss will be feeling the pressure of @entity99 's elimination - which makes @entity2 favourite to reach the final			1
of the @entity99 result , he said : ' it affects @entity2 a lot			1
his job will be to stay thinking about the next match			0
' the pressure increases for him because everyone 's looking to see if he 's going to play ( @entity118 ) @entity117 or ( @entity120 ) @entity119 in the final now			2
' under the roof : the tie continues into the night as the @entity124 and floodlights come on at @entity126 bid for success : @entity2 puts in his usual effort as he bids to claim a place in the fourth round nailbiting : the crowd keep a close eye on proceedings during a very closely fought first set @entity2 practices his forehand shot on friday , ahead of his third round match against @entity16 of @entity17 @entity137 , 37 and @entity138 , 41 from @entity140 queue for tickets to see @entity2 in action today clear skies over @entity144 : the rain has stayed away today , so far , to allow uninterrupted play at @entity5 hollywood star @entity147 joins @entity148 in the @entity149 to watch her sister @entity150 in action @entity2 with former coach @entity104 , who is now coaching today 's opponent @entity16 @entity2 said he did not think have his former coach in the opposing camp would have any bearing on the match			1
he received another boost yesterday when potential opponent @entity158 was beaten by @entity160 's @entity159			0
the @entity41 number one revealed he avoids watching replays of his games , and also tries to steer clear of lucky routines , although he does avoid wearing new socks			0
writing on a @entity167 blog , he said he puts on a new shirt and shorts for each match - players are given around 15 at the start of a grand slam - but added : ' one thing i never wear is new socks			2
they can be a little slippery '			0
fans were queuing yesterday morning - more than 24 hours before the match - to get tickets			1
