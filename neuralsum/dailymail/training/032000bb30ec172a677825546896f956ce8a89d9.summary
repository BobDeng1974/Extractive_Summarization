a @entity1 in @entity2 in @entity3 week will be the ruin of @entity6 football , they wail			1
@entity7 must go , they rant like dervishes in the desert			1
boycott it , rave the demented worshippers of the @entity12 as the greatest form of the oldest game on the planet – ever			2
such is the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair here about the date change from summer to winter following the award of 2022 to a @entity24 state			2
@entity25 hands the @entity1 to @entity2 and sheik @entity26 five years ago a computer - generated image of how the main stadium in @entity29 is set to look for the @entity1 in 2022 memories are short in the football blame business			1
it is not much more than a year since our national game – from the @entity35 and the @entity12 downwards – was in such profound discussion about introducing a mid-winter break to the season that it almost happened			1
no - one was worrying about the @entity3 and @entity41 tradition then			0
nor that it would bankrupt the @entity6 game			0
rather , there was a substantial body of opinion that the rush of festive fixtures was so physically damaging to footballers that it was detrimental to the integrity of our professional leagues			0
give us a break , cried the majority of our football managers , coaches and players			0
even until this week – when the @entity7 task force plumped for the cool of november and december in @entity2 seven years from now – @entity63 was virtually a lone voice expressing unbridled enthusiasm for @entity6 football ’s great @entity3 tradition			1
only this january @entity69 manager @entity68 sent @entity70 - his best player who also happens to be @entity72 ’s brightest prospect – on a two - week holiday to the @entity74 so that he might come refreshed for the second half of the season after missing some games			1
@entity63 is one of few public figures to give the @entity6 festive season a thumbs up @entity70 is pictured relaxing in @entity81 after being granted a break by boss @entity68 of course a winter @entity1 will not provide that kind of rest cure for young men apparently jaded by the exertions of playing football a couple of times a week in return for pay packets running into hundreds of thousands of pounds per week			1
this , not the @entity12 , is the greatest tournament of all and it demands that players scale the heights of skill and endeavour			2
but for the @entity6 football authorities to protest that the requisite change to the fixture list will put our game at risk of going skint is wretchedly disingenuous			0
what this is really all about is that @entity72 are miffed about not being given the right to stage either of the next two @entity107 - and wo n’t even be considered for one until the 2030s , at the earliest			1
and whatever you may think of president @entity25 , that is not @entity7 ’s fault			1
the @entity6 bids from 2006 onwards have been absolute disasters			0
in those campaigns , the @entity35 showed about as much grasp of what the football world expects of its @entity1 hosts as @entity119 and @entity120 of the catastrophic consequences of their over-throwing of @entity125 dictators			2
prince @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 appear in jovial mood ahead of that fateful day in @entity130 @entity128 , lord @entity131 and @entity132 of the bid committe share uneasy looks in @entity134 nor were the @entity12 of much help at all			2
the bids were so bloated with pomposity , arrogance and self - satisfaction – ‘ we ’ re the greatest , give it to us ’ - as to be laughable abroad			0
consciously or not , the @entity6 reaction to @entity2 amounts to an enraged attempt to bury the memory of those pitiful efforts by inflaming public opinion here against @entity7 in general and @entity25 in particular			1
this has become simply the default response here to almost everything football			0
by and large , however , it may surprise much of our own population that the @entity155 criticism is nothing like as vociferous elsewhere			0
even @entity159 , with whom the @entity35 and @entity12 like to regard themselves allied against the world governing body , have joined the other five @entity163 federations in approving the move to mid-winter			2
even @entity166 , one of the puppet challengers to @entity25 in the forthcoming presidential election , has given his backing			2
yet in their hysteria to scream foul , @entity72 ’s football bosses and many of the game ’s celebrities are blind to how @entity3 in @entity2 could actually help us win the @entity1 for the first time in half a century			1
@entity166 recently launched a campaign to oust @entity25 as @entity7 president @entity178 has taken a great deal of flak as a novice tv pundit but as he shrewdly points out : ‘ @entity72 normally go into a @entity1 at the end of a long season with our players dead on their feet			1
this might be good for us			0
’ not that the @entity12 are likely to pay much attention to that			2
so perhaps their memory needs jogging that most of the @entity193 nations take a midweek break during the festive season and that @entity199 ( one month off ) , @entity196 ( three weeks ) , @entity197 and @entity198 ( two weeks ) have all won the @entity1 since sir @entity200 , @entity201 and the rest of the sunshine boys of ’ 66			1
nor do any of their leagues appear to be going broke			0
most of the rest of global football ’s acceptance of @entity2 ’ 22 does no good at all to @entity72 ’s self - perceived fall - back position – that of being asked to step in as the alternative venue in the now highly improbable event of @entity2 being stripped of the @entity1			1
the @entity35 ’s only hope left appears to be @entity213 declaring war on @entity215 before the @entity1 goes there in 2018			1
that ’s how desperate they are			0
@entity219 – not only a genius rowing coach but a fine man – sadly died last weekend at the ridiculously premature age these days of 69			1
a world champion oarsman in his own right – despite his slight build – @entity219 coached @entity225 to 10 successive @entity227 victories from 1976 to 1985			2
two years later , five star @entity229 rowers at the @entity230 led a revolt against @entity219 and his unorthodox methods : ‘ he never trains , he only races			2
’ @entity219 , former rower , @entity225 rowing coach , author and @entity237 commentator passed away aged 69 what they failed to appreciate was that he was a profound psychologist and supreme analyst who knew how to win			1
he sacked the @entity229 and , against all odds and predictions , sent out his weakened , makeshift crew to beat @entity244 from @entity245 to @entity246 yet again			0
the @entity247 went home , dragging their oars behind them			0
@entity219 authored a renowned book about the mutiny @entity251 which was made into a major movie			0
he took to journalism , not only as writer but , since 1990 , as the most sage and entertaining voice of @entity237 rowing commentary			0
@entity219 ( left ) belied fears about his slim stature and went on to become an inspirational coach whenever it fell to me to report rowing – be it on the @entity265 or the greatest race of all when , at the @entity268 , @entity267 won his record fourth gold medal as the @entity271 ’s coxless four beat @entity272 by a fraction of a second – it was @entity219 who kindly and patiently marked my card			1
then , when the work was done , we went for a drink			0
shrewd , amusing , generous and engaging company , gentleman @entity219 will be hugely missed by all who knew him			0
a very private funeral will be followed , during this summer ’s @entity283 , by a memorial service out there beside the great river he loved .			0

the @entity1 final in 2022 will take place on december 23
this will *disrupt* the @entity12 and @entity293 season
a little more than a year ago , the idea of a winter break was touted
what this is really all about is that @entity72 are miffed about not being given the right to stage either of the next two @entity107
and whatever you may think of president @entity25 , that is not @entity7 ’s fault
@entity219 , genius rowing coach and fine man , sadly died last weekend
