by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 26 april 2013 they may regret saying it , but the winners of a £ 148million lottery jackpot insist they read every single begging letter they receive			2
@entity6 and @entity7 get between 30 and 40 requests for money a week – and they consider them all			1
speaking for the first time since their win last summer , mrs @entity12 , 40 , said : ‘ we do get a lot of letters , but in this world if you do n’t ask , you do n’t know			1
‘ you ca n’t condemn anybody for asking			2
it takes a lot of guts just to ask somebody for money , to just to come out and say it			1
’ when they won their massive @entity31 jackpot , mr @entity7 , 41 , ran a music shop in @entity47 , @entity48			1
he closed it just before @entity50 , charging £ 10 for 20 cds or dvds			2
the @entity36 went public with their win because they realised it would be hard to give money away and expect people to keep quiet about it			2
bombarded : they were rumours that the couple were forced to close their music shop ( above ) because of nuisance and abuse from beggars , but @entity6 has denied this was the case in business : mr @entity7 with his best friend @entity66 , left , inside the shop they said they planned to share their good fortune with a small but close group of family and friends			1
immediately after their win , the family were rumoured to have flown to a secret destination to ‘ acclimatise ’ after their life - changing jackpot			2
but rather than choosing somewhere exotic , they took an @entity82 flight to @entity83 and headed straight to the caravan park where mrs @entity12 ’s parents , @entity86 and @entity87 , live			1
the couple were new entries in the @entity91 rich list this week , but mrs @entity12 insists their life has n’t changed hugely			1
their children still go to the same school and play with the same friends , and the family ’s priorities have not altered			0
‘ you ca n’t say it does n’t change you but we ’ve tried not to let it change us			0
it highlights who your friends are , the people who are behind you through thick and thin , ’ said mrs @entity12			1
there are no financial worries any more and we ’ve moved to a slightly larger house , but my main aims are still there – my friends , my family , my children			0
it does n’t matter how much money you have in the bank , you would n’t be anybody without friends and family behind you			2
’ still on a budget : @entity7 and @entity12 board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £ 148million on the lottery jet - setters : the helicopter took the couple on a four - mile journey to @entity130 , where they boarded an @entity82 flight with their two children trading up : the couple have bought a £ 6million @entity136 mansion , with a stable in its grounds which is set to be turned into a musical instrument workshop when mrs @entity12 , who now lives in a £ 6million @entity136 mansion set in 100 acres , won the lottery last august , she said she wanted to do things locally and she is now helping to re-open a children ’s soft play centre			1
a year ago , the former health care assistant at @entity146 in @entity147 struggled to pay for her two young children , @entity149 and @entity150 , to have a joint birthday party at the play barn in @entity47			0
so when the @entity153 went out of business in february she stepped in to buy it			0
‘ the kids both wanted their party there last year – times were tight but we made a point of trying to budget for it , ’ she said			0
‘ both of them had half of their class there , they had a great time			0
‘ at the moment there ’s nothing for children from @entity47 and the surrounding villages , so we wanted to give them somewhere to go			0
’ the @entity36 ’ new house has seven bedrooms and four marble bathrooms as well as a three - bedroom annexe , a lodge , a three - bedroom farmhouse and four cottages			0
their jackpot was the second - biggest to be won by @entity39			0
the record is held by @entity183 and @entity184 , from @entity185 , who scooped £ 161million , also on @entity31			0
video down - to - earth @entity7 did not like the taste of champagne when the couple first won			1

@entity6 and @entity7 *inundated* with requests nine months after win
mrs @entity12 said : ' it takes a lot of guts just to ask somebody for money '
