@entity4 – @entity14 ’s official spokesman between 2001 and 2004 – was handed a contract thought to be worth at least £ 100,000 by former @entity3 minister @entity2 , who himself joined the @entity6 in february			1
the latest appointment reignited concerns over the corporation ’s links with the @entity20 leaving it open to charges of political ‘ cronyism ’ and prompting one @entity24 mp to brand the @entity6 the ‘ @entity25 ’			1
mr @entity4 ’s public relations @entity26 – only founded in april – has been hired to ‘ provide external perspective and expertise ’ to the @entity6 ’s own communications team			1
the deal was signed off by the corporation ’s new strategy chief mr @entity2 , a government whip under mr @entity14 before becoming culture secretary and then work and pensions secretary			2
former @entity37 deputy editor @entity36 was also appointed editor of @entity39 in may			0
last night @entity40 warned that @entity41 are ‘ very rapidly infiltrating ’ the @entity6 and criticised the corporation for failing to run an open recruitment process			2
it is also believed mr @entity4 ’s agency , @entity45 , was hired without a formal tender			1
in february , the @entity6 came under fire for handing mr @entity2 his £ 295,000 job without interviewing any other candidates			1
@entity24 mp @entity50 , who sits on the @entity51 , warned the new appointments would exacerbate political bias			1
he said : ‘ the @entity6 is indulging in @entity25 cronyism			2
@entity55 [ director general ] has recruited his new @entity3 friends and they are recruiting their @entity3 friends			0
the @entity6 is biased enough as it is			2
now it is becoming the @entity25			0
the only problem is it ’s not funny			0
’ former prime minister @entity14 pictured with former senior adviser @entity4 @entity65 , @entity24 chairman of the same commons committee , said mr @entity4 ’s contract ‘ looks like another old pal appointment ’ , adding : ‘ when there have already been concerns expressed about the left - wing leanings of the @entity6 , i do think this appointment certainly adds to the impression that the @entity6 is staffed by a centre left , @entity41 clique			1
‘ it was an unwise appointment for the @entity6 to make			2
’ @entity24 mp @entity73 added : ‘ it is deeply worrying the @entity6 is stuffing its senior ranks with ex @entity41 and @entity3 sympathisers			1
