' we always ask from each other the most of our own abilities on the court so i am looking forward to it			2
i 'm ready for the battle			2
when we played the last three grand slam matches they were the final stages of a grand slam , semi-finals , quarter - finals			1
' grand slams are the tournaments where you want to perform your best			2
i 'm sure we both are very much aware of that fact , and it 's why we get to play on a high level against each other and we push each other to the limit in a way			2
' it 's a very physical battle as well			2
but i have n't had too many long matches during this tournament			0
i 'm ready for it			0
i 'm going to practice tomorrow , do a little preparation for that match , try to analyse his game and what i need to do in order to win			0
' the @entity88 superstar slips on court during his 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 2 defeat of the big serving @entity13 former @entity92 champion @entity91 , now coaching @entity0 , was forced to leave his seat to answer a call of nature @entity0 reached the last four without dropping a set and only having his serve broken once a young fan of @entity0 watches the match with her face painted in @entity88 's national colours fans at the @entity4 show their support for @entity0 using some questionable wordplay victory for @entity0 saw him reach the 25th grand slam semi-final of his illustrious career @entity13 makes a return during the match on day 10 of the year 's first grand slam tournament @entity0 has not dropped a set on the way to the semi-finals for the first time since 2008 , the year he won his first title , and has only lost his serve once			1
' it was a great performance , definitely no complaints , ' he added after beating @entity13 in exactly two hours			1
' i returned very well , tried to get as many balls back in play			2
some games i had to just let it go and wait for the opportunities and when they are presented obviously try to use them and that 's what i 've done			0
' there are not many tournaments where i have just dropped serve once so i should enjoy it			0
it feels like @entity91 on the court			0
now i know how he feels			0
' that was a reference to @entity0 's coach , who nevertheless came in for some light - hearted criticism for leaving the court to answer a call of nature in the first game of the third set			1
' like everyone he has a need to go to the toilet which i understand ... but in the moment i had a break point and i thought he was guilty for me not using that break point , ' @entity0 joked			1
a subdued @entity13 added : ' he just did n't allow me to organise my game			1
even when he was returning well , by the end of the match he was doing a good job of playing deep and never allowing me to go forward			0
' obviously if you watch the footage , he was pretty much on the baseline the whole time and i was further back			0
' @entity0 , renowned for reaching shots that other players would struggle to , will play @entity5 in the semi-finals @entity0 never looked in serious trouble after taking the first set on a tie - break , while the @entity42 wilted as the match drew on a couple in the crowd announced their engagement to the delight of surrounding fans during the match @entity0 , whose athleticism is unparalleled on the tennis tour , stretches for a service return during the match @entity0 raises his hands in the air after completing a comprehensive victory but can expect a tougher time against @entity5 earlier in the day , @entity5 defeated fifth seed @entity11 6 - 3 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) in two hours and four minutes and has dropped just one set in making the last four			1
@entity11 had won their previous encounter , also in the quarter - finals of a grand slam , in five sets on his way to the final of the @entity185 at @entity186 last year			1
but fourth seed @entity5 dominated wednesday 's match from the outset and his only nervous moments came when @entity11 saved five match points from 6 - 1 down in the tie - break			1
@entity5 eventually took his sixth match point with his 20th ace and believes he is a better player with more belief than when he won here 12 months ago			1
' i 'm more aggressive			0
i have more confidence with my game when i come to the net , ' @entity5 said			2
' i know that now i have a grand slam at home			1
i won the @entity201 also ( with @entity202 )			0

' i was struggling on my serve and that 's why i could n't get a good rhythm in the first and second set , ' he said			0
' the tie - breaker was really close			2
if i could get that one , it might change the whole thing			0
