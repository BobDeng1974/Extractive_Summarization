@entity0 , with his father @entity1 , who had to have his toes amputated after contracting frostbite while being forced to live in a tent the family of a disabled man claim he had to have all of his toes amputated after he was forced to live in a tent through the winter because he was evicted from his home			1
@entity0 , 32 , was diagnosed with frostbite six weeks ago after his sister discovered his blackened toes and rushed him to hospital			1
they were so badly diseased that they could not be saved and they had to be amputated			2
it came after mr @entity0 had been living in the tent with his father @entity1 , 62 , following their eviction from their four - bedroom home in @entity23 , @entity24 , last year when they fell behind with their repayments			1
mr @entity0 's father was also diagnosed with severe health problems including malnourishment , scabies and dementia			1
mr @entity0 's aunt , @entity32 , 54 , said : ' it 's absolutely outrageous what has happened to my brother and nephew			1
' they lived in their home for 30 years and got into difficulty last year			2
' they had their benefits sanctioned and things just spiralled out of control			0
' they both have neurological conditions and disabilities and kept missing jobs interviews , so the problem got worse and worse			0
' in july they lost their home and i tried everywhere to get them accommodation but nowhere would take them			0
' ms @entity32 says she was then forced to buy her brother and nephew a tent , which they pitched on the @entity58 in @entity23			2
she also supplied them with food parcels from local food banks , while trying to provide for her own family			2
she added : ' i felt awful that i could n't take them in , but i 'm a single parent , with my own disabilities and i just knew i could n't cope			0
' i tried my best for them and contacted so many different organisations , but just kept getting turned away			0
' @entity68 said they could n't come and assess them because they were in a tent - it was just farcical			0
mr @entity0 's toes , which eventually had to be amputated after he caught frostbite from living in a tent during winter after being evicted from his home ' when we saw @entity0 's toes we were horrified , that this can happen to people in the 21st century is disgusting			1
' mr @entity0 has now been given temporary accommodation by @entity24 and his father @entity1 has been taken in by the @entity83 housing association			1
ms @entity32 believes that the problems all stemmed from the government 's spare bedroom benefit cuts			0
she explained : ' the bedroom tax is an awful thing , it 's affecting people 's lives all over the country and needs to be repealed			0
' a @entity93 spokesman said : ' mr @entity0 and his son have never been sanctioned and continue to be supported through benefits and by jobcentre staff			1
' we have given their local council hundreds of thousands of pounds to support vulnerable people through our housing benefit reforms			0
