scientists have found extraterrestrial dust at the bottom of the @entity4 's ocean			1
thought to be from supernovae , it has settled on ocean floors			0
researchers say analysing it could help to determine the amount of heavy elements created by the massive explosions			1
the so - called @entity13 emerged about 1,000 years ago through a star 's supernova explosion : researchers have found extraterrestrial dust at the bottom of the @entity4 's ocean and say it could help explain the phenomenon			1
the team analysed a 10 centimetre - thick sample of the earth 's crust , representing 25 million years of accretion , as well as deep - sea sediments collected from a very stable area at the bottom of the @entity28			1
they found 100 times less plutonium - 244 than expected			2
the fact that these heavy elements like plutonium were present , and uranium and thorium are still present on earth suggests that such an explosive event must have happened close to the earth around the time it formed ' small amounts of debris from these distant explosions fall on the earth as it travels through the galaxy , ' said lead researcher dr @entity47 , from the @entity48			1
' we 've analysed galactic dust from the last 25 million years that has settled on the ocean and found there is much less of the heavy elements such as plutonium and uranium than we expected			1
' the findings are at odds with current theories of supernovae , in which some of the materials essential for human life , such as iron , potassium and iodine are created and distributed throughout space			0
@entity66 also create lead , silver and gold , and heavier radioactive elements such as uranium and plutonium			2
dr @entity47 's team studied plutonium - 244 which serves as a radioactive clock by the nature of its radioactive decay , with a half - life of 81 million years			2
' @entity81 that existed when the earth formed from intergalactic gas and dust over four billion years ago has long since decayed , ' dr @entity47 said			0
' so any @entity81 that we find on earth must have been created in explosive events that have occurred more recently , in the last few hundred million years			0

' we found 100 times less plutonium - 244 than we expected , ' dr @entity47 said			2
' it seems that these heaviest elements may not be formed in standard supernovae after all			0
' it may require rarer and more explosive events such as the merging of two neutron stars to make them			0
' the fact that these heavy elements like plutonium were present , and uranium and thorium are still present on earth suggests that such an explosive event must have happened close to the earth around the time it formed , said dr @entity47			1
' radioactive elements in our planet such as uranium and thorium provide much of the heat that drives continental movement , perhaps other planets do n't have the same heat engine inside them , ' he said			0
a supernova is a stellar explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy , radiating as much energy as the @entity133 or any ordinary star is expected to emit over its entire life span , before fading from view over several weeks or months			0
a supernova sends titanic shock waves rumbling through interstellar space			0
it leaves behind an ultra-dense neutron star in its wake , which spews out a blizzard of high - energy particles .			0
