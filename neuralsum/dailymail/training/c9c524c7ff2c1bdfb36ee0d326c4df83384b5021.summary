a lesbian couple claim they were told to stop kissing one another in a fashionable @entity4 eatery by the manager because it is a ' family restaurant '			1
@entity7 , 29 , said that she and her partner @entity8 went to @entity9 at the @entity10 on the @entity11 in @entity4 for dinner during a break from work			1
ms @entity7 said she had moved to sit next to her partner on the bench seats to console her after ms @entity8 became upset , when a woman they believe was the manager approached them and told them to ' stop what you are doing ' because they were in a ' family restaurant '			1
' yes , it was an intimate moment but again , [ i was ] consoling her and it was just a simple , sort of loving reaction basically			0
' the second comment , that it was " a family restaurant " made me feel well , why does that matter ? ' is it because children were present ? not that there were any children present at that time			0
' and why should it matter if it is a family restaurant ? ' ms @entity7 explained the couple had experienced a stressful week , including moving house and ms @entity8 , a performer , was upset			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) says she and her partner were out for dinner when they were told to stop kissing by a member of staff because it is a ' family restaurant ' she said : ' @entity8 was upset so i moved on to the same bench as her , we had previously been sitting opposite one another			1
i consoled her , kissed her on the cheek and gave her a light peck on the lips as well and just had my arm around her			2
' i did not notice any adverse reaction in the restaurant			0
then a lady came over to us , we do n't know for sure but we are pretty sure it was a manager , and that 's when she said it			0
' she did not apologise			0
@entity63 challenged her and said " is it a family restaurant or a homophobic restaurant ? " ' the staff member said no but gestured for the pair to sit apart from one another , ms @entity7 said			1
she added they paid their bill but left feeling ' incredibly angry ' and that @entity9 has since apologised for the incident			2
@entity73 , co-founder of @entity9 , said : ' everyone is welcome at @entity9 , whether gay , straight , old or young regardless of sexuality			2
' we are horrified at the thought of being labelled anti-gay - half of our team are gay			0
' we take any such claims incredibly seriously and we have investigated this incident in depth			0
the @entity85 at the @entity10 where the women were allegedly told to stop kissing ' in this case members of the team made a reluctant decision because they considered that the behaviour of the two people - rather than who the people were - might make others in the restaurant feel uncomfortable			2
' this would have been the same whether it was two women , two men or a man and a woman			0
' at @entity9 , we pride ourselves on being a modern , equal opportunities , open and accessible business ; we want everyone to feel welcome in our restaurants and we are sad and very sorry if ms @entity7 and her partner felt otherwise			1
