@entity0 can relate to struggling to find the time to get to the doctor to fill a prescription for the pill @entity6 women are risking unwanted pregnancies by not finding the time to fill their prescriptions for the contraceptive pill			1
squeezing in an appointment with a gp for a new prescription is proving difficult for women aged between 18 and 40 as the latest statistics show more than half of the females admitting to failing to do so at some stage since using contraception			1
@entity21 resident , @entity0 , 26 , can relate all too well with life being too manic to find the time to organise another trip to doctor			2
three years ago when she was just 23 years - old , ms @entity0 could n’t refill her pill prescription because she had left it at work over the weekend and when her period did n’t arrive on time she began to panic			1
‘ i took a test which said it was negative but until i got my period i was really worried because those tests are not always 100 per cent accurate , so it was quite scary , ’ she said			2
‘ i spent spent two or three weeks freaking out and was very relieved when my period finally came			0
' ' i now know to be more careful - if i do n't have time to get my prescription filled then i use other forms of protection			1
' ms @entity0 said she receives emergency calls from friends asking to borrow a week 's worth of her pill of the 634 women surveyed last month by @entity44 , one in five had risked unwanted pregnancy because they have n’t got their prescription filled in time and had sex without contraception ms @entity0 said it can a hassle to get to the clinic for a new prescription			1
' i know in my working day - if you do n't have a repeat prescription - you ca n't just go down the chemist - you have to sit in the doctor 's waiting room in your lunch break and it can go over time , ' she said			1
' or you have to go after work and you have things to do - you want to go out and see your friends - you do n't want to be stuck waiting around all afternoon			0
' @entity66 gp @entity64 said many women do n't realise that by not taking the pill consistently can risk efficacy , hormonal imbalance and troublesome symptoms such as spotting			1
' but the number one thing is you will get pregnant if you do n’t use the pill properly , ' she said			2
' there is a 99.7 per cent effective rate in preventing pregnancies if you take it every day at the same time but as soon as you start taking it ad hoc that effectiveness comes down to 91 per cent			1
' ms @entity0 said most of her friends often used the pill when it suited them			0
' i get emergency calls from girlfriends asking to borrow a week of my pill because they do n't have time to get their own , ' she said			2
' a lot of girls tend to use it more for convenience such as going on holidays and do n't want to get their period - or they 've just started seeing someone new but then if they are single they go off it			0
' there is a 99.7 per cent effective rate in preventing pregnancies if you take it every day at the same time but the effectiveness drops to 91 per cent if you start taking it ad hoc dr @entity105 suggests women who are juggling too many balls to be able to find the time to get to the doctor to try accessing a script via the internet on @entity112			1
unless there are complications , the process only takes about 10 minutes which includes answering 30 questions - then the patient has the option of having the script posted to their home or the medication sent to their doorstep			0
however , dr @entity105 about 10 per cent of patients are not suitable for an online consultation			0
' it 's not like buying a kettle from an online site , ' she said			0
' we can call or text the patient for more details and if we think it is the wrong pill for you or it is a complicated case , we refund your fee and recommend you to see your doctor			0
' ' but the patients with an uncomplicated history get processed that day			0
' dr @entity105 insists the service was not replacing the face - to - face appointments with your gp which was still necessary for many other situations , but this was simply an accessible option for time - poor females			2
