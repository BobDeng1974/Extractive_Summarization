published : 07:30 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 01:28 est , 5 june 2012 the @entity1 habit of tea - drinking can help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes - but only if you drink four or more cups a day			1
a study of @entity9 populations found that countries that drank four cups a day - the @entity1 average - had a 20 % lower risk of developing the illness			1
tea drinking ranged from an average of none a day in @entity16 to four a day in the @entity1			1
the @entity1 habit of tea - drinking can help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes - but only if you drink four or more cups a day the study found that benefits seemed to be most obvious among heavy tea drinkers - drinking a mere one to three cups a day does n't lower the risk			1
a research team led by @entity26 from the @entity27 at @entity28 , @entity29 , said previous analyses showed tea consumption was associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes			0
‘ obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes , but dietary factors may also play a role			2
one dietary factor of interest is tea consumption			0
' tea consumption may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes by influencing glucose digestion , glucose uptake , and by protecting beta - cells from free - radical damage			2
this beneficial effect may be due to the polyphenols present in tea			2
’ @entity26 said , ‘ drinking at least four cups of tea per day was associated with a 20 per cent lower risk , whereas drinking one to three cups per day did not lower the risk of diabetes compared with non-tea drinkers			1
but it was unclear if tea is associated inversely over the entire range of intake			0
he wrote ‘ therefore , we investigated the association between tea consumption and incidence of type 2 diabetes in a @entity9 population			0
’ it was done in 26 centres in eight @entity9 countries , and consisted of 12,403 incident type 2 diabetes cases plus thousands of others without the disease			0
tea drinking ranged from an average of none a day in @entity16 to four a day in the @entity1			1
@entity26 wrote : ‘ increasing our understanding of modifiable lifestyle factors associated with the development of type 2 diabetes is important , as the prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly			0
‘ in line with this , no association was observed when tea consumption was studied as continuous variable			0
this may indicate that the protective effect of tea is restricted to people with a high tea consumption .			2

drinking one to three cups has little effect
four or more *reduces* risk 20 %
four cups a day is @entity1 average
