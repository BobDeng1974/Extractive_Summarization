@entity1 's next generation of space suit - the agency 's first in 20 years - will look familiar to fans of computer generated cartoon classic @entity7			1
that 's because the new white and green z - 1 suit bears more than a passing resemblance to the interstellar hero @entity11			1
the prototype suit was revealed in a host of pictures uploaded today to photo - sharing website @entity16 , and it boasts trim of the same hue as that worn by the space ranger action figure			1
to infinity , and beyond ! @entity1 's new z - 1 prototype space suit , which , with its fetching bright green trim , looks rather like that worn by cartoon hero @entity11 @entity1 's inspiration ? the @entity27 space ranger strikes a similar pose in @entity29 a large hemispherical transparent dome covering the wearer 's head also looks remarkably similar to that worn by @entity11 - although the latest pictures do not make clear if @entity1 's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases			1
the main advance in @entity1 's rather more primitive effort is that it will have an entry point at the rear to make it easier to don than previous suits			1
astronauts will be able to climb into it as quickly as you see in films , and not take an hour as they do now			0
the new suit will also effectively be its own airlock , dispensing with the need to spend time getting the pressure right			0
the ' @entity52 and @entity53 ( @entity53 ) 2.0 ' , to give it its full title , will hopefully be ready in the next couple of years			0
on the rear will be a giant backpack which doubles as a hatch that can latch onto another space ship or @entity61 - like vehicle			2
there is therefore no need for ‘ @entity64 ’ which involves using oxygen to make sure the suit is the same pressure as the ship , and can take up to an hour			2
there will be better bearings on the legs , ankles , hips and waist to help astronauts move more naturally whilst a urethane - coated nylon and polyester layers control the pressure more efficiently			1
flexible : a @entity1 engineer shows how the improved suit allows its wearer greater mobility than previous versions			1
it is also designed to be quicker to put on new technology will also create more efficient cooling and will get rid of carbon dioxide more easily			2
currently certain components have to be baked between missions to get rid of it			0
@entity1 says the @entity91 represents a potential soft exploration extravehicular activity ( @entity93 ) suit configuration , though its description ' is a bit of a misnomer ' , according to spacesuit engineer @entity98			1
' the suit actually contains several hard mobility elements , ' she said			0
' the term " soft " is intended to convey the idea that the primary structures of the suit are pliable fabrics when unpressurized			0
' this prototype suit is the first in a series being developed under the @entity111 suit project , with the aim to have a new ' vacuum - compatible ' suit ready by 2015 at the latest			2
' the @entity91 was developed as a test bed to go and test various technologies and mobility joints so we can further define our architecture going forward , ' ms @entity98 said			2
how @entity1 's suit matches up to the @entity27 model : the latest pictures do not make clear if @entity1 's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases - but it otherwise looks remarkably similar the lessons from the first version will be taken into account for the development of its planned next iteration , the @entity129			1
@entity130 , lead of the @entity132 , said : ' the data we ’re gathering now will feed tools that will help us build better suits in the future			0
' we have n’t built a new flight system since the @entity139 ( @entity139 )			0
the last major prototype we developed was in 1992			0
' with missions to @entity143 now on the horizon , an updated version was called for			0
the project has been especially taxing for @entity1 engineers as do not yet know where the space suit will be used , meaning it has to be ready for anything			1
ms @entity130 added : ‘ it 's like you 're trying to go on vacation , but you do n't know if you 're going to @entity153 , @entity154 , or @entity155 ’ .			0

@entity1 's white and green @entity91 prototype space suit looks remarkably similar to that worn by the cartoon hero
the main advance in @entity1 's suit is a rear - entry point to make it easier and quicker to put on than previous versions
joints and materials have also been *redesigned* so that astronauts can move more easily when wearing the suit
