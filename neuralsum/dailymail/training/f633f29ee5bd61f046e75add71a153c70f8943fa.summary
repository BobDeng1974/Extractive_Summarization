@entity0 will mark its first anniversary on the air next week despite averaging just 17,000 viewers a night			1
the news network has recorded low ratings since it first aired and recently had to layoff staff and cut some live newscasts			1
@entity0 has also won awards for its work , seen some recent audience growth and its chief executive insists a steady growth plan is on target			1
@entity0 will mark its first anniversary on the air next week despite averaging just 17,000 viewers after several unsuccessful years trying to get its @entity16 carried widely in the @entity17 , the @entity15 - based @entity0 bought and closed @entity19 's current tv network last year and set up the @entity17 - focused @entity0 to replace @entity20 in the @entity17 it is now available in nearly 60 million cable and satellite homes , just over half the @entity17 market			1
@entity25 , a former reporter for @entity27 's @entity26 and @entity20 , said : ' the quality of the channel is very much what was promised			0
' it is serious of purpose , by far the best news channel available to @entity17 viewers			2
' @entity0 won @entity35 for documentaries on cholera in @entity38 and a deadly factory fire in @entity40			1
the network had six first - place finishes in the @entity43 , which honors notable journalism			0
@entity45 said he recognises online 's importance but that @entity0 is first a television network two weeks ago , the @entity49 honored @entity0 for ' creative , compelling , character - driven storytelling			1
' aside from award judges , not many people have seen those stories			0
so far this year , @entity0 has averaged 17,000 viewers in prime time , ticking up to 23,000 during the first week of fighting in @entity56			1
@entity59 has averaged 453,000 and @entity60 1.87 million in the same period , the @entity58 company said			1
@entity62 , @entity0 's chief executive , considers that comparison unfair			1
the other news networks have been operating much longer , and are available in more homes			1
their audiences were small at the start , if they even allowed @entity58 to measure them , he said			0
@entity0 's first year should instead be judged on the quality of its journalism and growth in distribution , he said			2
' @entity17 are not yet aware of @entity0 , ' @entity45 said			2
' we are , on a gradual basis , continuing our advertising , continuing our outreach			0
awareness and perception will take time			0
' while the @entity84 - @entity83 conflict gives the network a chance to showcase strength in international reporting , @entity45 said it also covers stories in the @entity17 that its rivals do n't			0
the prime - time newsmagazine @entity91 recently traveled to all 50 states for stories — reporting on gang violence in @entity94 , a slow - moving project to sculpt the image of @entity97 on a @entity99 mountain and a woman in @entity101 who makes coats for homeless people			0
next month , director @entity104 delivers a new documentary on high school students ' lives			0
@entity108 , a former @entity59 @entity17 president whose new startup just launched an online channel for @entity111 said : ' i do think there 's a market for it			2
' but to launch a cable channel in @entity17 today is a scary proposition because there is so much clutter in the marketplace			0
it is as much a marketing proposition as a content proposition			0
' he 's not sure @entity0 has broken through with its message , saying people seem to be more aware of the news organisation @entity128			1
@entity60 and @entity129 are more known for their points of view while @entity59 , which suffered through some of its worst ratings ever this spring , is beefing up its nonfiction , non-news programming			1
@entity25 believes buying @entity136 was a mistake because @entity20 was having modest success streaming its channel online			0
because of cable deals , live streaming has stopped			2
people have to search for @entity0 on their channel lineups and sometimes ca n't even get a high - definition picture , he said			1
@entity45 said he recognises online 's importance , but that @entity0 is first a television network and @entity148 is still a more lucrative business			1
from the start , critics said the name @entity0 — conjuring memories of @entity155 administration criticism post-september 11 — is a off - putting in the @entity17 @entity0 is determined not to change it , not wanting to dilute its brand worldwide			2
@entity0 laid off a few dozen journalists in april , and @entity45 recently told the staff that a smaller round of layoffs is coming			2
some two and a half hours of live @entity0 newscasts have been replaced by simulcasts of @entity20 programming , and staffers have been told to be mindful of travel expenses			1
some wonder if the @entity15 parent company 's deep pockets have bottoms , and whether that reflects a lack of confidence in the @entity17 network			0
' there is no rethinking here , ' @entity45 said			0
' i just need you to be aware that i also run a business			0
i had a budget for my launch , and i have a budget for the operation for years one and two and three			0
