@entity0 were written off as @entity2 no - hopers by former players like @entity4 and @entity5 before they arrived in @entity6 but here they have been backed as a surprise package by perhaps an unlikely source			1
@entity9 may have trashed @entity0 in his controversial autobiography but he left @entity11 on sunday after bowing out of the @entity12 with some encouraging words for the team that have moved on without him			1
‘ now they have got @entity20 as skipper i think @entity0 are going to go really well , ’ said @entity9 , who found success and enjoyment with @entity18			1
‘ they ’re getting scores over 300 and @entity24 is batting beautifully			0
’ @entity9 believes @entity0 can do ' really well ' with @entity20 as captain in @entity6 the @entity0 team has moved on without @entity9 ( right ) but he was still full of praise @entity24 has been in fine form during the tri-series down under this month both @entity4 and @entity5 suggested @entity0 ‘ did not have a cat in hell ’s chance ’ of winning the @entity2 before they replaced @entity36 as captain with @entity20 and it is the change at the top that has led to @entity9 ’s optimism			1
‘ i ’ve been in that team and players talk , ’ he said			2
‘ if @entity36 ’s position was being spoken about as much as it was on tv and in the media then i know it was being talked about in the dressing room			0
‘ i ’m just happy it was done for @entity36 ’s sake , for @entity0 ’s sake and they can move forward with the one - day side now			2
you can just see it with the scores they are getting now			0
i know there was a stutter against @entity6 in @entity55 but that can happen and does n’t mean anything			0
’ @entity9 has less faith in an @entity0 bowling line - up that lacks the variety of a left - arm bowler in both pace and spin			1
‘ it ’s a very exciting batting team , i just have a little reservation about the bowling , ’ he said			0
@entity9 says @entity66 ' does n't look right ' and is n't bowling as fast as he should the explosive batsman impressed for the @entity18 in the @entity12 @entity68 also found form , but was demoted to the @entity71 tour and @entity9 says that 's a mistake ‘ @entity73 looks great but @entity74 does n’t look quite right			1
he ’s not bowling as fast as he could which might be down to coming back off his knee injury			0
hopefully he will get a bit faster			0
‘ i just think @entity0 missed a trick with @entity68			1
imagine him batting at three and doing a @entity80 job ? he came out here to the @entity12 and first game , batting at three , he hit 70 - odd from 30 balls			0
‘ just imagine him in that line up ? @entity86 , @entity24 , @entity68 , @entity87 , @entity20 , @entity88 , @entity89			1
would you want to bowl at that ? ’ @entity9 clearly has n’t changed his opinion on @entity93 , who he said should have followed his father and become a jockey rather than a cricketer in his book			2
and he believes that @entity68 long run of poor form with both bat and ball going back to @entity0 ’s tour of @entity103 should have been overlooked			1
@entity9 , whose future in @entity106 cricket is in doubt , has n't changed his opinion on @entity93 ‘ he ’s had a poor year but he ’s been up and down and thrown around , ’ said @entity9 of the @entity108 all - rounder			2
‘ he ’s played a lot of cricket against sub-continental teams whereas the @entity2 is in @entity6 and he was one batter last year who did so well here , scoring that century here in @entity11			0
‘ i understand he ’s had a poor run but that was mainly on the sub-continent and against spinners			0
’ @entity9 has now returned to @entity0 where his future in the domestic game is very much in doubt with @entity124 having no plans to re-sign him for this season			1
but clearly he feels that @entity0 are now moving in the right direction .			2

@entity9 trashed @entity0 in his controversial autobiography
but explosive batsman says team can go ' really well ' with @entity20
however , @entity9 says bowler @entity66 ' does n't look right '
@entity68 is playing for the @entity71 in @entity135
