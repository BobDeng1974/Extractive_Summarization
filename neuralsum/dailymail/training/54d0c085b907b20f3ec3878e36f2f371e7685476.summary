designed by acclaimed @entity2 - @entity1 architect @entity0 and inspired by @entity4 's @entity3 , the new @entity5 in @entity6 aims to honour the scars of @entity9 's past while educating and promoting reconciliation to the next generation			1
construction of the unique five wooden structures , ranging from three to eight storeys , will begin next year on the site of a former @entity17 re-education centre , and they will house the @entity19 of @entity9 , along with a graduate school , auditorium and museum with changing works			2
human rights activist @entity24 , executive director of the @entity19 which was founded with @entity25 , provided a brief that included the explicit request that the building veer away from the stereotypes usually associated with genocide memorials			1
the new @entity5 in @entity6 , designed by acclaimed @entity2 - @entity1 architect @entity0 , has been granted building approval ' @entity9 will never escape its history , but it does not need to be enslaved by it , ' he says			1
' post-conflict societies have to move on			0
' @entity36 architecture has tended to reflect the evil and misfortune of the historical period it represents [ but ] in this sense the architecture 's legacy is dark , sombre , and firmly oriented in the past			0
' nearly two million people - 21 per cent of the country 's population - died at the hands of the communist @entity17 regime led by @entity50 between 1975 and 1979			2
rather than just a museum , the @entity5 incorporates the library for @entity54 's biggest collection of genocide - related material , a graduate school focusing on genocide , human rights and conflict studies , a research centre and archives , and a media centre and auditorium to be used by the entire community			1
the plans , which have received final approval from the government , also include a 730,000 - square foot memorial park with sports fields , orchards and vegetable gardens , and forest with traditional sculptures , all to be used by the wider community			0
the five wooden buildings in the complex will be separate at the ground level but will intertwine as they rise , becoming one cohesive unit ' we were keen to create a forward - looking institution that deviates from the distress - invoking , quasi-industrial harshness of most existing genocide memorial models , ' @entity24 said			1
' this is not to criticise or denigrate such models but , instead , to emphasise that in light of @entity9 's rich cultural and religious traditions , we must move in a different and more positively - oriented direction			0
' ' the best memorials are not objects we visit once , contemplate , and file away			0
the best memorials evoke reflection and commemoration , but are also living , dynamic public places that engage with all generations within the community			0
' the memorial will include the @entity19 of @entity9 , along with a graduate school , auditorium and museum the structures themselves will be separate at ground level but will intertwine as they rise upwards , inspired by the connecting levels of the @entity3 temple in @entity4			1
@entity105 translates as ' the power of the leaves ' , an homage to the dried leaves used to record history			0
the existing research institute , which will move into part of the new development , is home to more than one million documents that recount the atrocities of the @entity17			2
@entity24 himself was a survivor of the horrific period of the @entity119 after being a prisoner of the @entity17 , who ruled from 1975 - 79 , when he was just 15			2
the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity9 , which provided inspiration for the new @entity5 @entity0 , a controversial choice for the soon - to - be iconic project given she 's not from the region , said she hoped that the institute and its memorial park would transform the community			1
she said : ' our hope is that the @entity5 and its memorial park can have a truly transformative effect , bringing new life and a bright future to a site that holds traces of the great tragedies of the past ... an inviting place where reflection , interaction and connectivity are not only its spatial expression , but also embedded within its covenant to the people of @entity9			0

@entity5 in @entity6 to include five buildings that are separate at ground level but intertwine upwards
inspired by @entity4 's @entity153 , the complex is designed by @entity2 - @entity1 architect @entity0
building 's brief was issued by surviving @entity17 prison survivor and human rights activist @entity24
@entity24 wants it to deviate from ' distress - invoking , quasi-industrial harshness of most existing genocide memorials '
