by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 18 may 2013 fighting fit : young soldiers on a training exercise - the recruitment of under 18s for the @entity5 could be scrapped a former defence minister has called for the @entity5 to stop recruiting ‘ boy soldiers ’ – a move that would bring an end to centuries of military tradition			1
sir @entity12 says letting 16 and 17 - year - olds join the @entity14 is outdated			1
he claims they are more likely to die or be seriously wounded , and that millions of pounds are wasted due to high drop - out rates			1
the issue will be discussed in the commons on tuesday and could eventually lead to a ban on enlistment of those under 18			0
according to military watchdog @entity24 , of the 22,000 recruits who join up each year , 4,700 are boys and girls under 18 and 80 per cent choose the @entity5 over the @entity28 or @entity29			1
@entity31 mp sir @entity12 , who was the @entity32 until last september , described the current recruitment policy as ‘ increasingly anachronistic ’			1
he added : ‘ if it was stopped , these youngsters would have to look at some other work - based training that might make joining the @entity5 a conscious decision rather than just drifting into it			1
‘ those who join the @entity5 aged 16 are more likely to die or be severely wounded in action because they tend to join the infantry , which has much higher death rates than the rest of the forces			1
’ the recruitment of boys began in the 18th century when drummers aged ten were sent to the front line			0
the age for joining up was raised before the @entity48 , but by the end of the conflict it was estimated that thousands of youths – some only 15 – had been killed or wounded in action			1
following an outcry over the deployment of 17 - year - olds to the @entity56 in 1991 , and to @entity57 in 1999 , the @entity5 amended its rules to ensure that no one under 18 could be sent on operations where there was a possibility of hostilities			1
however , at least 20 soldiers aged 17 are known to have served in @entity65 and @entity66 due to errors by the @entity68			1
' outdated ' : former defence minister sir @entity12 described the policy of recruiting under 18s as ' increasingly anachronistic ' @entity71 , of @entity24 , which is leading demands for a ban on boy soldiers , said : ‘ the use of children and adolescents in warfare has a long history but the policy deserves to be evaluated ethically and with regard to the modern standards of care of young people			1
' the critical question is whether it can be reasonable to assume that minors are generally able to make informed and responsible choices on a matter with such far - reaching consequences			2
’ but the mother of 18 - year - old @entity92 – the youngest @entity93 soldier to die in @entity65 – said the current policy should continue			1
@entity99 said : ‘ when @entity92 was 16 , i reluctantly gave my consent for him to join the @entity5			2
stopping him would have been pointless – he would have signed up at 18 anyway and he would n’t have had all that extra training			0
’ the @entity68 said : ‘ no one under the age of 18 may volunteer to join our @entity14 without the formal written consent of a parent or guardian			0
there are currently no plans to revisit the recruitment policy			2
’ comment by @entity109 , @entity110 commander i commanded a platoon of junior soldiers in @entity114 , @entity115 , in 1984 , some of whom went on to join the @entity118			0
captain @entity119 , the first regimental sergeant major of the @entity121 , was a perfect example of the quality of soldiers who came through from such a young age			0
he had been recruited at 15 with his twin brother			0
junior soldiers are leaders from the start and are trained to be the future elite of their peer group			0
those who advocate a ban on recruiting under - 18s show a profound ignorance of the situation			2
yes , training junior soldiers costs a lot because of the quality of the courses			0
however , the product is fabulous so the @entity5 is prepared to pay for it			0
a higher drop - out rate is expected too , but the staff - to - student ratio is high to deliver the care and supervision the youngsters need			1
it is true that our @entity148 allies have ceased to recruit under - 18s , but they do n’t have armies – they have aggressive camping organisations that have no expeditionary capability			2
campaigners have no demonstrable understanding of how the @entity5 and its regimental system promotes families , and the paternal approach taken towards the training of these boys and girls			0
they ’re not being trained to kill at 16			2
and any comparison to @entity163 ’s use of soldiers aged 12 and 13 demonstrates a complete loss of perspective and context			0
if we stopped recruiting bright 16 and 17 - year - olds , we would destroy the opportunities currently afforded to these young people			1
for some it ’s a way out of a disadvantaged background based on their individual merit			0
prejudice against the military is at the heart of this campaign , and the net losers will be kids who had a chance to win a sought - after place on a life - enhancing course			2
signing up for x factor is no alternative – their talent lies in leadership			0
this vital quality , it would seem , has no value in our brave new @entity93 .			0

sir @entity12 describes policy is ' increasingly anachronistic '
*believes* 16 and 17 - year - olds more likely to die or be seriously wounded
also claims millions of pounds is wasted due to high drop - out rates
