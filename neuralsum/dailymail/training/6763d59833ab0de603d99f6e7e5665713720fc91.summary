on duty : @entity136 was responding to reports of a break - in when he challenged @entity139 although her client had a ‘ lengthy record of offending ’ he had never previously committed a crime of this nature she said , and when confronted with what had happened that day he simply ‘ panicked ’			0
ms @entity129 said , at the time , @entity2 was voluntarily co-operating with the police ’s offender management team , which works with prolific offenders at high risk of re-offending to try to keep them out of trouble			2

despite this , the officer said it was his wish to return to the force ‘ which he loves ’ and where he has served 11 years			0
even with treatment and physiotherapy , he said recovery could take up to two years			0
judge @entity196 , passing sentence , told @entity2 : ‘ the reality , of course , is that the genesis of all of that happened on that day was because you were out doing what you do - burgling people			2
‘ it is plain you used your vehicle as a weapon , quite deliberately , and caused very serious injury			0
‘ you were driving while banned , having previously been convicted of driving dangerously before , and in addition there is the aggravating factor of @entity33 ’s injuries			0
