@entity1 's @entity0 reflects on @entity3 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity4 at @entity5 on tuesday			1
@entity6 opened the scoring for @entity9 's side before captain @entity10 struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals			1
@entity3 celebrated a 3 - 1 victory over @entity4 at @entity5 in an international friendly on tuesday @entity6 came in well off the touchline for his goal but his all - round game was not good enough			1
he did n’t work hard enough off the ball and @entity3 can not afford to carry anyone defensively			1
when @entity4 had the ball , @entity6 too often went into rest mode and @entity24 stole a march on him too many times down the flank			1
he is always a threat going forward but he needs to get into a defensive position much quicker and learn to cut out the ball down the line			0
@entity6 scored the opening goal as he glanced home @entity35 's cross @entity35 was often caught out of position defensively at @entity5 he was guilty of not doing that for @entity37 against @entity38 recently too and that left @entity40 far too exposed at right back			1
@entity6 took his goal very well but there are still areas of his game that need improving			2
@entity3 need to get @entity35 on the ball more			1
he ’s our playmaker and is supremely talented and @entity3 were n’t looking for him enough against @entity4			1
when they did finally get him on the ball , we saw with the goal just what he is capable of			0
but @entity35 is partly to blame too			2
he was sometimes standing in positions where he could n’t receive the ball that easily from his team - mates			2
he needs to work harder to find the space so the rest of the team can get him on the ball in dangerous positions			0
@entity35 produced a superb assist for @entity3 's opening goal and was a creative threat the attitude of @entity3 ’s players impressed me			2
they did not seem to have an eye on protecting themselves ahead of the return of the @entity69 , they were fully committed			0
@entity70 put in plenty of tasty challenges and @entity10 and @entity73 in particular looked well up for the game			0
this fixture might be a friendly by name but it clearly mattered more than that to @entity9 ’s men			0
it was good to see them showing some strong fighting spirit			0
@entity3 striker @entity70 puts in a sliding tackle on @entity84			0

@entity3 beat @entity4 3 - 1 at @entity5 on tuesday
@entity6 opened scoring for @entity3
@entity37 winger must track back defensively and not go into rest mode
@entity3 must get playmaker @entity35 on the ball more
