by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 19 june 2013 @entity1 , 14 , came to @entity2 on a year - long placement from @entity4 , @entity5 , to improve her @entity2			1
and all those hours conjugating verbs and practicing pronouns came in very handy on sunday when she met two vips at a @entity12 polo match and was able to ask them politely ( and extremely excitably ) to smile for the camera			1
so in july she will return to her hometown armed not only with fluent @entity2 , but also with a very special photo to adorn her bedroom wall : a snapshot of a grinning prince @entity19 and a chuckling prince @entity20 , trundling through the grass after the match			1
@entity1 proudly shows the photograph she captured of prince @entity19 and prince @entity20 at the polo @entity1 was herself photographed running up to the young royals and excitedly taking their photograph using her @entity27 , and was featured doing so in @entity28			1
speaking to @entity28 , @entity1 said : ' i was really so excited and not at all shy			1
i just ran towards them and said , " could you please smile for my picture ? " ' and they did			2
both of them smiled at me			2
and then they started laughing			2
@entity1 's @entity37 photo captured on her @entity27 ' i was so excited			2
i said thank you and then i ran off			0
i was very polite but i did n't think to curtsey - i did n't really know what that is			0
' i sent the photo to my friends and family who think it is hilarious			0
' @entity1 has been a fan of the young royals for some time , believing they are ' quite important for @entity2 , and really smart - looking '			1
but would she have reacted the same way if the @entity47 had turned up ? ' i do n't think i would have run up to the @entity47			0
she 's a bit too important			0
' @entity1 has spent a year on an exchange programme at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity12 , and was watching the charity polo match at the local @entity53			1
she said : ' i 'm going to keep the photograph on my @entity27 to look at , and maybe print it out and put it on my wall			0
' this is the most exciting thing that has happened to me all year			2
i will go home happy now			0
' @entity1 even had a tip for @entity19 , 30 , with regards to the naming of his first child , who his wife @entity66 , @entity66 , is expecting in july			1
' i like @entity66 and she is very pretty			0
' so i think it would be good if they had a girl as she would be pretty too			0
it would be nice to call her @entity72			0
' @entity1 was overcome with excitement after the @entity74 smiled at her for the photograph the brothers laugh good naturedly as they realise the young woman is taking a picture of them prince @entity19 and prince @entity20 are spotted by eagle - eyed @entity1 fan @entity1 as they enjoyed a charity polo match at @entity53 , @entity51 , @entity12 during the match the duo could be seen entering into the competitive spirit with gusto as @entity20 appeared to shoulder barge his older brother as they battled for the ball			1
