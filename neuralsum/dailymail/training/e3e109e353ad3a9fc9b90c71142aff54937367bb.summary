by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 20:01 est , 29 november 2012 @entity2 puppeteer @entity1 , 52 , is facing the threat of a fourth legal suit from a young man alleging sexual abuse at his hands			1
he will be represented by @entity8 , the attorney for @entity10 's second and third accusers , @entity11 , 24 , and a 29 - year - old man so far known only as @entity13			1
mr @entity8 is still ' verifying ' the fourth man 's story , but has told @entity16 , ' it is very similar and so far nothing has fallen by the wayside in vetting it '			1
an adolescent @entity1 with his mentor @entity21 , the choreorgrapher , costumer designer and creator of some of @entity2 's most popular characters a 19 - year - old @entity1 , two years after his first encounter with @entity21 and the same year he met his future wife , @entity27			1
whatever the outcome of these cases one thing is clear			0
@entity1 's life is far from the open book which he suggested when he described himself recently as a ' proud gay man '			1
in reality he has lived a double life for decades			1
it began with an invitation to join in @entity38 33 years ago			1
@entity10 was just 17 - a gangly 6 foot boy - wowed to have been invited to @entity40 by an older man he had met only once			1
that invitation came from the flamboyantly named @entity21 , a man to whom @entity10 has professed life - long gratitude and loyalty			1
@entity21 died in 2008 at the age of 91 and is survived by partner of 50 years , @entity45			1
' that year many of the @entity2 characters were literally in need of warm bodies , of hands , actually , ' @entity10 has recalled			1
' i would be a sort of @entity53 temp on the @entity2 float , filing in where needed			0
' i was so wired on the train up to @entity40 that i could n't relax of focus on anything			0
' the voice of @entity1 ; the face of something far less appealing			2
clash has been hit by a series of damaging allegations that he had sexual relations with underage boys @entity69 , 23 , the first accuser who recanted but now stands by his original claims @entity11 , 24 , the second accuser to file a suit against @entity10 in as many weeks a generous mentor : @entity21 with his creaton , @entity74 , he invited @entity10 to stay in @entity75 after several phonecalls and one brief meeting @entity21 was a remarkable man with a lifetime 's experience of theatre , costume design and puppets			1
he worked with choreographers like @entity84 , designed costumes for the @entity86 and created @entity74 and the mammoth like mr @entity88			2
he spoke with an affected @entity89 , sometimes @entity90 , accent though he was from @entity92 and he was @entity1 's first entre into a world that was exotic , exhilarating and far removed from his @entity96 background			1
clash has called them his ' fairy godmothers '			0
clash is now the older man			0
but the difference is that @entity10 is being accused of a much more sinister ' game of father and son ' , as one of his accusers put it			2
clash grew up in @entity107 , a blue - collar community just east of @entity96 , @entity109			0
his father , @entity115 , was a flash welder , his mother , @entity114 , ran a ' home - style daycare centre ' from the two bedroom , one bathroom home in which @entity1 was raised with his three siblings			2
it was a hardworking , loving environment but , from the very start , it was one from which @entity10 stood apart			2
in a neighbourhood where kids played hopscotch , rode bicycles and jumped rope clash had a fascination with fabric , old buttons , his mother 's discarded house - slippers ... anything from which he could make the puppets he loved from watching children 's television shows			2
as a young man living in @entity10 lived one life : in @entity40 he lived another entirely driven by passion : clash age 19 , in @entity40 on the set of children 's show , ' @entity146 ' as a boy @entity10 put on puppet shows for the children at his mother 's daycare centre			1
while other kids played sport , @entity10 performed puppet shows for the children at his mother 's day - care			1
neighbours and peers thought his fascination was out of the ordinary , not that it bothered @entity10			2
when he was 15 he performed at the local heritage fair in @entity107			0
he made his own puppets , built his own set and met his first mentor as a result - local television host @entity166			0
he was a fixture on local @entity168 affiliate @entity167 , news announcer , weatherman , popular children 's entertainer			0
he approached @entity1 after his show and asked him to audition for a show he was putting together			2
' i 'd never had a boss before , ' @entity1 recalls			2
' i had to master the art of give and take '			0
it was an art he mastered and by the time he was 17 , @entity10 was obsessed			1
@entity21 - whose shared first name with @entity182 's famous frog is only coincidental - came into @entity1 's life when he his puppet workshop was featured in a television show			1
clash was ' blown away ' he recalls in his memoir , my life as a @entity189			0
it was his mother who encouraged her son to make contact , to look up mr @entity21 's number and give him a call			1
nervous and fearful of rejection clash did just that			0
' we spoke for about ten minutes , ' he writes			0
' before hanging up he invited me to come up to his workshop for a visit '			0
as luck would have it @entity10 's school , @entity204 , had a trip to @entity40 planned			1
for @entity206 , this included a personal visit to mr @entity21 's @entity209 workshop			1
the man looked , @entity10 recalled , ' like @entity211 , ' with his long white beard and workshop full of marionettes and muppets			2
they kept in touch - the 17 - year - old fan and the mentor four decades his senior			0
after that stint he returned to @entity96			0
he hung out at his mother 's daycare centre			0
he observed the kids , ' how their emotions turned on a dime '			0
he studied them to improve his art and years later putting into practice those observations in the tactile character of @entity1			1
@entity1 and @entity74 together on the @entity2 float at this year 's @entity38 but for the first time in more than 30 years @entity10 was not there when @entity21 telephoned and invited @entity10 to join in @entity38 his parents , he says , ' did n't hesitate to let me go '			1
they dropped him off at the station			0
@entity10 spent the night in @entity21 's @entity209 workshop			1
' @entity21 had a pull - out futon in the office area , ' he remembers in his memoir			2
' and i dutifully got ready for bed trying to avoid the temptation to poke around ... i could n't sleep and eventually abandoned the futon , giving in to my urge to check things out '			0
@entity243 , left , with @entity182 , centre , and @entity245 , right on the set of @entity2 over the course of the next day 's parade @entity10 was introduced to the cadre of puppeteers who would become his colleagues and companions on his increasingly regular visits to @entity75			1
@entity243 was key among them			0
a talented puppeteer who died of @entity257 in 1992			0
@entity243 was openly gay - when @entity258 made a guest appearance on the @entity260 he notoriously and rather bluntly hit on @entity243			0
it was @entity243 who , four years later , threw a small red muppet in @entity10 's direction and said ' give him a voice '			1
that voice was that of the @entity1 that millions of children so love today			2
after the @entity269 he remained in touch with the @entity2 puppeteers			0
he travelled regularly to @entity75 , shared an apartment with a fellow struggling artist @entity273 and started to establish his ' big city ' life supported by his ' fairy godmothers '			0
@entity21 was ' generous with his time ' and often on set as both puppeteer and @entity2 character , @entity283 the @entity282 man			2
meanwhile , back in @entity10 lived a different life entirely			1
at the age of 19 he met @entity27 , a student nurse and they began dating			0
in 1983 he was invited to be a full time cast member on one season of @entity2 , though was still to secure his own character			0
double life : @entity27 , above , was married to clash for 17 years and they had a daughter , @entity293 , right clash attending the @entity295 in @entity40 , 2010			1
he honed the excitable , tactile character of @entity1 from watching the children in his mother 's daycare @entity1 and @entity27 married in 1986			1
@entity27 gave birth to their daughter , @entity293 , in 1993 and it is clear that both remain committed , loving and mutually supportive @entity306 were together for 17 years before , as @entity10 puts it , they ' finally admitted the relationship was in trouble '			2
after all , his life was increasingly riven between that of his @entity75 circle and his @entity96 family			0
perhaps it was inevitable that the two lives - one that began with that invitation to @entity40 from @entity21 , the other embarked upon with @entity10 's own proposal of marriage - would prove unsustainable			1
though none could have imagined quite how catastrophically they would be thrust into the spotlight			0
@entity1 's lawyer has said that the allegations have ' no merit ' and that his client 's reputation will be ' robustly defended ' should the cases go to trial			1
but for the time being the man whose career was made by finding a voice remains silent			0
and the voice of @entity1 has become the face of something altogether less endearing .			2

how @entity74 creator , @entity21 , *changed* the course of @entity1 's life after inviting him to stay over and help out at @entity38
sparked a ' passion ' for the art of puppetry that drove @entity10 to lead a double life for decades before his eventual *divorce* from his wife
now faces a fourth claim after trio of young men claim he ' groomed ' them for underage sexual abuse
