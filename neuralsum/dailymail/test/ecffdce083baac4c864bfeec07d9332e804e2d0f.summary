@entity0 is counting down the games until @entity2 win the @entity4 title , and he thinks they have shown their strength by staying top of the table since ' day one '			1
the @entity10 defender and his club team - mates sit top of the table ahead of facing @entity13 at @entity14 on saturday , six points clear of nearest rivals @entity16 with a game in hand			1
the @entity19 have long been considered title favourites and @entity0 puts that down to the lightning start they made back in august , winning seven of their first eight games to take up first place early on			1
@entity0 ( centre ) is counting down the games until @entity2 win the @entity4 title @entity0 's @entity2 sit top of the table ahead of facing @entity13 at @entity14 on saturday at 3pm in fact , @entity31 's men have only briefly relinquished the title lead , on goal difference , since their impressive 3 - 1 win over @entity36 at @entity37 in their season opener back on august 18			1
their form has dipped at points since , most notably in defeats to @entity42 and @entity43 , but @entity0 is confident that @entity2 have been able to get through their bad moments unscathed			1
' we have been top of the table since day one , ' he said			0
' we kept that position obviously and had very good moments , as well as some less good moments , but we were there still top of the table and this is the strength of the team			0
' you can be up and down , but you have to be focused on the target and i think now we are in a very good position			0
' @entity31 's men have only briefly relinquished the title lead since their opening 3 - 1 win over @entity36 @entity60 scored in the opening weekend win at @entity37 and has scored 18 more in @entity2 's title bid @entity2 signed @entity63 left back for £ 16million in the summer , but he has been largely kept out of the team by @entity0 who has consistently played in his less - natural position rather than at right back			1
unsurprisingly , the 25 - year - old @entity67 - who has had two weeks off after not being selected for his national team - is pleased to have kept his place under new competition within the @entity2 squad this season as they go in search of a league and @entity75 double			2
@entity77 ( right ) arrived for £ 16million at @entity2 in the summer but has been kept out by @entity0 ' if you ask every player in every team , they are going to say they want to play and when you do not play , obviously you are not as happy as when you do play , ' @entity0 told @entity83			2
' i have to go out on the pitch and give everything , to try to fight for every ball , to play and be useful for the team			0
and obviously when i finish the game and i feel i have given everything and we win , i am happy			2
' there are individual battles in the game that you have to win			0
and after , if we win every one then i think the team will also win			0

@entity2 are six points clear with a game in hand in the @entity4
they have led the title race since a *brilliant* start to the season in august
@entity0 feels that consistency puts them in pole position to win
