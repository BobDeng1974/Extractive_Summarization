it was a conversion that would make even the hardiest property developers shudder			2
made to resist a bomb - let alone a drill - this was nothing like your average makeover			1
but once @entity8 set eyes on the @entity11 bunker , she was itching to give it a go			2
this included discovering information about enemy patrols , wiring parties , or sniper positions and relaying them to pilots and commanders			1
it was a notoriously dangerous place to be as @entity50 would target any ' sap - heads ' , as they called these dugouts , to stop them interfering			1
in this particular dugout , workers are said to have been protecting the nearby cable tower - though many facts are still classified until 100 years after they were filed			1
after the war the shelter lay derelict for decades - only used by a farmer for his potatoes - until ms @entity8 saw it in a @entity36 estate agent 's window			1
@entity17 on the roof of her home in @entity20 , @entity21 , with her sun vent and her satellite transformed : @entity17 spent years working on the heavy duty concrete to turn it into her ideal home ms @entity8 describes the bunker as ' paradise ' saying the property which has no windows is ' a magical fortress ' a room with a view : there is a panoramic view of the surrounding fields and cliffs standing on top of the roof having bought it for £ 143,000 , ms @entity8 needed to spend five years and £ 100,000 making the necessary changes			1
now it is a fully functioning family home			1
the three - bed bungalow has two bathrooms and a wet room			1
a 23ft open plan living area , with a kitchen and lounge , is lit by purpose - built sun tubes that poke through the sturdy ceiling			1
beyond her private drive and large garden , with a garage and shed , ms @entity8 can peer over the open countryside			2
secluded : the dugout used to spy on the skies and protect our vital cable tower was purposely difficult to find buried : the bunker under grass and shrubs before work began			1
the builders had never seen anything like it the bedroom was once an air circulation unit ventilating the hideout , which was manned 24 hours a day the bunker had been untouched for years when ms @entity8 , 42 , began construction on it it is secluded , with no windows , but ms @entity8 , 42 , calls it paradise			1
' it is a magical fortress , ' said ms @entity8 , who lives in the sentinel with her two @entity122 and a @entity123			2
' you are at the @entity125 and living history			2
' you do n't know what you 're letting yourself in for when you take this kind of thing on , but i know i live in the best place in the world now			2
still the same : despite the orange walls , modern lights , and carpeting , a veteran recognised the exact lay out you can hardly imagine the scenes in 1942 as men and women sat here frantically protecting @entity143 's borders former property developer ms @entity8 was planning to renovate and move on but the market crashed ' we get a lot of family and friends visiting			1
because of where it is and what it is , it 's quite a novelty			2
kids love it and blokes love it because they never grow up really			0
' sometimes it 's worth going over the top for something			0
' a former property developer , ms @entity8 , 42 , had been planning to renovate and move on when she bought the dugout in 2007			0
but when the market crashed , she was forced to sell up her normal , more marketable home and settle in the 1942 - built war den. it took more than a month to get through the concrete roof to fit an emergency fire sprinkler - needed to make up for the lack of windows and fire escapes			1
and hidden under a three - foot mound of soil , the whole place had to be insulated to curb any damp			1
modern : despite the change of plan it is now a perfect home - clean , clear and stylish , with no trace of dust thanks to the nearby @entity180 , @entity17 has perfect wireless connection in her secluded paradise what is now the bedroom was once filled with an air circulation unit			1
the hallway was a tunnel to another bunker			0
ms @entity8 , now a jewellery maker , said : ' really it was a blessing in disguise			0
but it has taken years to make it right			0
a mammoth project : it has taken five years and £ 100,000 to shape this den into perfection ' it was always just a holiday home and always on the market			1
' at first it was just an unmissable opportunity - this is like the highlight of someone 's career			1
i was always going to move on and continue with the business			0
' then the crash happened and i was stuck			0
it was very poor timing			0
' i had other properties - three - bed semis - that i would have lived in			1
but in an economic crisis those are far more sellable			0
' the building process was very difficult			0
' it has n't been done before so the builders were n't used to this kind of space			0
it took much longer and much more money than expected			0
' despite the changes - orange walls , cable tv - it still looks exactly the same as the bunker intelligence officials used to protect @entity143 's essential cable station in nearby @entity180			1
and there is no shortage of interest from scholars and veterans wanting a peek around			0
' we have had a lot of interest , ' ms @entity8 explained , ' a man studying bunkers of that era came round and i learned a lot about my home that i never knew			2
' amazingly , the family of a veteran came down the other week			0
they said their mum now has dementia but told them she worked here during the war			0
sleek : one of the two bathrooms			0
they are now colourful , sleek and stylish despite being built in 1942 colourful : the house has more style to it than veterans will remember of their 1940 's sentinel ' they did n't believe her but once they were in , it was exactly as she had described it			1
' their mother was very happy about it apparently , and it was so interesting for me to hear			0
' living in here you do really appreciate the way people fought - you feel a sort of connection with what they were doing			2
it is something i do n't want to take for granted and one of the best things about the place			0
' reluctantly selling up to be closer to work , ms @entity8 's historical abode is on the market for £ 275,000 with @entity280			2
ms @entity8 added : ' sometimes you do have to move on , but really i could live here forever			0
it is beautiful and special			0
