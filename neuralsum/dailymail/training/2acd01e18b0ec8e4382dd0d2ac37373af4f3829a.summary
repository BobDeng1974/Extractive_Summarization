doctors and nurses face being struck off or disciplined if they can not speak clearly in @entity2 , under new regulations announced today but the new bill will unite the nine bodies currently covering healthcare , allowing them to work from the same legislative framework			1
the powers would also allow regulators to proactively investigate instances of suspected poor conduct and practice whenever they come to their attention			1
whereas currently some can only investigate once they have received a formal complaint			1
for the first time the sanctions regulators can impose will be extended and they will be able to discipline or strike off professionals who are not able to communicate clearly in @entity2			2
the @entity32 also allows regulators to reconsider cases that have been closed following a mistake or error , as recommended by the inquiry into the scandal at @entity38			2
a process of revalidation - where professionals undergo ' mots ' to ensure they are still fit to practise - will be extended from doctors to all health and social care professionals			0

the new bill will unite the nine bodies currently covering healthcare ' our recommended reforms place patient protection firmly at the heart of a new legal framework			1
' if implemented , they will enhance the autonomy of the regulators , empower them to respond more quickly and effectively to emerging public health concerns and enable them to meet the demands of a modern , devolved health and social care sector			2
' a joint letter signed by the regulators calls on the government to support the new plans and asks for ' urgent parliamentary consideration ' of the @entity32			0
it said : ' @entity90 was tasked with creating a single , streamlined legal structure covering all nine regulators which would enable us to provide better protection for patients , be more responsive , reduce the burden of regulation and to drive down costs			1
' we were , and remain , committed to these aims			0
realising them is essential if we are to retain the trust and confidence of the public , healthcare professionals and the health service in which those professionals work			0
' the recommendations of @entity109 following events in @entity111 highlighted the vital importance of effective regulation focused on promoting safe , compassionate patient care rather than , as too often in the past , intervening only after patients have suffered harm			0
