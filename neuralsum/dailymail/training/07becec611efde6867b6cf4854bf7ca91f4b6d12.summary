' leaving the @entity6 and becoming a separate country would give @entity4 a ' new , more modern relationship with the other nations of the @entity6 " that would be a " true partnership of equals '			0
he adding : ' i believe on september 18 the people of @entity4 will vote @entity43 to create a better country than we have now , one we can pass on with pride to the next generation			0
' the vote is taking place after the @entity23 won an unprecedented majority in @entity51 in the 2011 election			1
former chancellor @entity53 ( second left ) said pressure would mount on mr @entity7 to spell out what independence would mean			1

a no vote means a future of governments we did n't vote for , imposing cuts and policies we did n't support			1

' former chancellor @entity77 today warned pro-independence campaigners not to bank on a @entity80 oil boom			1
speaking in @entity19 , the @entity81 minister told @entity7 not to ‘ bet the ranch ’ on figures ‘ pulled from the air ’			1
his comments followed the release of figures which showed @entity80 oil and gas tax revenues will drop from £ 34 billion to £ 33 billion between 2012 - 13 and 2017 - 18			1
the change appears to leave an £ 8.5 billion gap between the @entity92 's revised figure and the @entity94 's least optimistic estimate			0
mr @entity77 , the @entity6 minister without portfolio , said : ‘ i do n't find them very convincing			1
nobody believes that ( oil ) is an answer to our economic problems			1
‘ if we were to have an independent @entity4 , it is not the case that it would not somehow have to face up to the consequences of economic crisis			0
’ he added : ‘ the main thing i pick up is concern among my political friends in @entity108			0
the average @entity109 and the average @entity110 is far from excited about the prospect of having a referendum of this kind , ’ mr @entity77 said			1
mr @entity7 announced the date to @entity51 as the @entity115 was published			2
he has already put forward legislation to allow 16 and 17 - year - olds to take part in the crucial vote			0
in january the elections watchdog today threw out an attempt by @entity7 to skew the question in the scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting @entity43			1
the @entity94 wanted to ask voters : ' do you agree that @entity4 should be an independent country ? yes / no. ' but the @entity127 has demanded ' more neutral wording ' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing ties with the rest of the @entity6 will mean for @entity4			0
the question voters will be asked in next year 's vote will be : ' should @entity4 be an independent country ? yes / no. ' former chancellor @entity53 , the chairman of the cross-party better together group campaigning to keep @entity4 in the @entity6 , said there were still unanswered questions about independence			2
he said : ‘ i think most people in @entity4 are desperately anxious to know the facts here , to know what the details are			0
‘ of course i 'm ready and i 'm willing to put forward a powerful case for why @entity4 is stronger and better as part of the @entity6			0
‘ what is singularly lacking on the other side though is anything remotely resembling a compelling case for making a complete break , it really is buying a one - way ticket to a deeply uncertain destination			0
’ he added : ‘ this is the biggest single decision we will make and that is why i strongly believe we need the details from the other side , from the @entity159			0
they have failed to provide that so far			0
" it 's all very well to produce the date after this long and unnecessary delay , but we now need to get the details so we can get stuck into a serious debate			2
" earlier @entity167 , the chief executive of the pro-independence @entity169 campaign , said the announcement of the date was ‘ another important landmark day that brings us closer to the referendum ’			1
he told @entity176 @entity4 's @entity175 programme : " for those of us who believe the best future for @entity4 is as an independent country it 's a very significant day			0
" it makes the referendum much more imminent and gives an added reality to it			2
we move from the stage where a lot of the debate about independence has been at a theoretical level , a process level			2
i think people are engaging more and more with the issues			0
’ the @entity127 also recommended the main @entity43 and no campaigns be allowed to spend up to £ 1.5million each in the run up to the big vote			0
@entity4 's first minister @entity7 , right , secured a landmark deal with prime minister @entity197 last year to hold the referendum in 2014 better off in : the @entity201 survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want @entity4 to be independent , the lowest level since the @entity51 was established in 1999 pro-independence campaigners suffered a major blow in january when a major survey revealed support for mr @entity7 ’s dream of going it alone was now at its lowest level since the @entity51 was created in 1999			1
experts claim increased publicity for the @entity23 ’s campaign to leave the @entity6 has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean			1
just 23 per cent of people want @entity4 to leave the @entity6 , the annual @entity201 survey for 2012 revealed			0
it shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported independence			2
