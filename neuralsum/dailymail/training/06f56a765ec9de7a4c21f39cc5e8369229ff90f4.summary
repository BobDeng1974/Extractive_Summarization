' a @entity13 source told @entity118 : ' we intend to feature various women during this advertising campaign			1
' we felt the commercial with @entity0 was the best spot to launch this campaign			2
' advertising creatives at @entity126 in @entity127 came up with the idea to use women - and an online survey of men with erectile dysfunction was conducted by @entity13			1

' @entity13 launched this campaign because we ’re committed to providing support and resources for men with @entity135 ' patents give a drug a monopoly , generally for 20 years			1
