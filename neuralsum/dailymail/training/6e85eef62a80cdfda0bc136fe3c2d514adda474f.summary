@entity0 will be heading off to grad school , but when she finally begins classes at the @entity4 , her classmates will be several years older than her			1
in college at age 12 , @entity0 just graduated from @entity7 and is on the fast track to receive her phd in cognitive science and human robotic interaction by age 22			1
her mom @entity13 says its all down to their homeschooling that has allowed her daughters the freedom to study at their own speed			2
looking to the future : 16 - year - old college graduate @entity0 is headed to @entity21 next month to start working on her @entity22 her parents , @entity24 and @entity25 began homeschooling all of their three daughters early on because they were being bullied			1
' i guarantee , if you home school your kids for eight hours a day every day , they ’ll be in college at age 12 , too , ' @entity24 told @entity33			1
the girls worked through coursework in a summer that would take other students an entire year to understand			2
@entity0 skipped middle school and high school and instead enrolled in college at the age of 12			1
that transition into college took some getting used to , @entity0 says , both for herself and for her classmates , who were not used to the idea of a 12 - year - old taking advanced math courses			1
not your average teen : those who know @entity0 well say she is always fun to be around and likes to try new things ' it was a love / hate relationship , ' she says			1
' it was a great new class that i looked forward to , but i kept getting the same questions from students day after day			0
' by the end of the year , however , the novelty of her presence wore off , @entity0 told @entity57			1
' now , most people do n’t say anything , ' she adds			0
' they think i ’m 19 or 20 , most of the time			0
' she says that she does n't miss skipping out on the ' traditional high school experience			2
' ' i ask people about if they enjoyed high school or wish they had skipped it , and i get answers both ways , ' @entity0 says			1
' i liked the way that things turned out for me , and i would n’t change anything if i could go back			0
' @entity0 says she has always been drawn to computers , like her father , a computer programmer			1
fast learner : at age 8 , a pony - tailed @entity0 made a chess move in a game against her big sister , @entity75			1
the two super-smart sisters went through high school , @entity77 and @entity7 together we are family : @entity0 ( right ) with her two sisters and mom , @entity24 ' there was always some computer or something around to play with , ' she says			1
she says that she is especially excited to work with human - robotic interactions and wants to start studying cognitive science			2
' it is something that i have always found fascinating , ' she says			0
' we will never fully understand how the brain works			0
it ’s the kind of field that you could start learning and never get to the end of it because we do n’t know , and it ties in closely to computer science and artificial intelligence			2
' she just graduated from @entity7 with honors in computer science and will pursue a doctorate in the same field at @entity4 for the next six years			0
she chose @entity4 because it offers a computer science specialty called interactive computing that will allow her to delve into cognitive science , neuroscience and other interdisciplinary arenas			0
' my passion lies in finding new solutions to new problems , ' she says			0
not only is ms. @entity0 a genius , but she also has a knack for artificial intelligence			1
' it was because i wanted to do something different that nobody had done before			0
' at the age of 15 - years - old , @entity25 worked 600 hours to create her own artificially intelligent robot who could make its own decisions and operate itself			2
i 've got all my sisters with me : @entity0 , 16 , ( left ) , @entity125 , 19 , ( center ) and @entity127 ( right ) , 13 , are some of the smartest kids around			1
@entity0 and @entity75 graduated from @entity7 last week			1
@entity127 said she plans to do the same before that , @entity0 also attended the coveted @entity130 as a keynote speaker in 2011			1
after building her mini-robot zenith , designers of the robotics program flew from @entity135 to meet with @entity0 to learn more on how she pushed the limits of their software to create such an exceptional feat. her talent for computing showed early , thanks in part to an unusual home environment			1
her parents , both with @entity145 , worked at home a lot , half time for her trust - manager mom , @entity24 , full time for her self - taught database designer dad , @entity150			0
he had a lot of computers , enough that all three daughters could bang around on them from infancy and got one of their own as preschoolers			2
colorful character : @entity0 , left , then a 14 - year - old community college student , took part in a state robotics competition with friends one scene from a plane , as recalled by @entity13 : when @entity0 was not yet 2 , she and her mother took a flight , each with her own laptop , unusual for a toddler in the 1990s			1
while @entity24 worked , @entity0 played a simple interactive game , appearing to deftly use the computer as she sucked on her pacifier			1
at landing time , mother told daughter to shut down her computer , and she did			0
but @entity24 struggled to get hers off , even after she yanked out the battery pack			0
a flustered flight attendant insisted she shut it down			0
from the back of the plane , a chorus of voices shouted : ' ask the baby			0
' @entity25 passed the laptop to @entity0 , who did , indeed , turn it off			1
' the whole back of the plane erupted , ' @entity13 says			0
good friends : @entity0 ( second from left ) , says she does n't mind having skipped out on high school the program @entity0 played was a @entity197 game designed to teach 4 - to 6 - year - olds letters , sounds and words			1
her parents assumed she was just enjoying the goofy graphics and punching random keys			0
@entity0 , not yet 3 , said what any little sister might : ' my turn			1
' then , to her mother 's astonishment , ' she read and read and read			0
every book you could put in front of her , she could read			0
' at age 2 , with help only from @entity197 , she had cracked the code			2
@entity215 , @entity150 , says he is proud of his daughter and everything she has accomplished			0
' when your kid graduate from college , it ’s always a proud moment , ' he says			2
' but the fact that they are going to grad school is also very inspiring for us			0
and the fact she is at such a young age too			2
' but , he adds , watching @entity232 graduate was a bittersweet moment			2
' the trouble with having a girls a smart as her is that you have to see them advance a lot sooner than you were planning , ' he laughs			0
' you have to deal with it			0

@entity0 began to play with computers at before the age of two
she skipped middle and high schools and went *straight* to college
now a graduate , she is about to start her phd later this year
her two sisters appear to be just as clever
