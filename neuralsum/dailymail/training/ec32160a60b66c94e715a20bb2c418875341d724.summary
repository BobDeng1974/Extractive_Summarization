by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 feels his level of maturity will stand him in good stead for a potential tilt this year at a second formula one world title			1
off the back of strong form in pre-season testing as @entity8 racked up the most kilometres and @entity2 posted the second quickest time , both he and they start as favourites to win the championship			1
it is a tag , however , that does not sit too well with @entity2 nor @entity20 boss @entity19 bearing in mind a wheel has not yet turned in anger at a grand prix			1
growing up : @entity2 claims his increased maturity will put him in good stead this season circus : @entity2 signs autographs for fans in @entity29 ahead of the @entity31 @entity30 this weekend @entity32 : @entity2 and @entity8 team - mate @entity33 walk on @entity34 in @entity29 ready ? @entity2 was greeted by a mob of photographers and fans only come qualifying for this weekend 's @entity31 @entity30 will the teams disover where they truly stand in the pecking order as @entity42 's new era , after a raft of regulation changes , begins in earnest			1
and only then will @entity2 learn if he really is in with a chance of becoming a double world champion after claiming his maiden crown in 2008			1
the 29 - year - old said : ' everything happens for a reason , and from the ups and downs , the different experiences i 've had , i 've learned a lot			2
' i 've had bumps along the way , but i always feel like i 've bounced back from them			2
it 's not how you fall , it 's how you get back up			2
' so through all those experiences , you just brush the dirt off your shoulder and you keep going			2
' i 'm still enjoying my life , and my famly and i are in a position we never thought we 'd be , coming from a one - bedroom flat in @entity70			2
' so we 're embracing the opportunity , i 'm embracing it			2
i feel very fortunate to be here , amongst these drivers , driving for @entity8			1
it 's just a dream			2
' i 'm 29 now			2
it feels like a long , long time since i started - i 'm starting to get with the older guys - and i feel like i 'm maturing			2
' so hopefully that will show in my results , my performances , the things i say and do			2
suited and booted : @entity2 is desperate to build on a decent testing by snatching a win @entity83 and large : a security guard towers over the diminutive @entity2 ahead of sunday 's race @entity87 speed : @entity2 bears his crucifix during the interview session on thursday stage is set : @entity2 is eyeing a second world title , his first with @entity8 ' i 'm still young at heart and i 'm sure i 'll make some mistakes along the way , but that 's part of life			1
' @entity2 can understand why @entity42 observers are hailing @entity8 as successors to @entity101 's crown given what unfolded in testing , and why they have been labelled as favourites			1
but he added : ' everyone is talking us up and predicting the future , but we really ca n't say what 's going to happen this weekend			0
' we know we 're strong , we 've left no stone unturned , we 've done absolutely everything we could possibly do			0
' we 're hoping we 'll be at the front , which is our goal , but we ca n't say it 's going to be the case			0
' so coming here , saying this is going to be the best chance i have over the years , i do n't know , i have n't even got in the car and raced yet			0
' i had a good year in 2012 which was a strong year , and i probably had an opportunity in 2010 which i did n't optimise on , so i 've had some chances in the past			0
' it is a long , long year , and a long time since i won the world championship			1
it feels like a long time ago			0
' but i 'm still here and a lot more motivated from when i was before , more focused than ever before			0
' so if the package is there then we will do the job , and there 's no reason why we ca n't fight at the front again			0
' centre stage : @entity137 has reminded everyone who the current world champion is no 1 : @entity137 believes those who write him and @entity101 off are acting rashly meanwhile , reigning world champion @entity137 has warned his critics to write off at their peril his chances of him becoming only the second driver in @entity42 history to win five successive world titles			1
following a wretched pre-season of testing in which the new @entity101 often ground to a halt , the odds are on @entity137 failing to even cross the line in sunday 's season - opening @entity31 @entity30 , never mind stretching his winning streak to 10 races after taking the chequered flag in the final nine of last year			1
the @entity157 - based team encountered a raft of problems with the @entity160 - with @entity137 continuing his trend of providing his car with a girl 's name and this year calling it @entity165 - that has placed them firrnly on the back foot going into the race around @entity29 's @entity169			1
it has been suggested the car appears quick enough , and if @entity101 can get on top of their reliability issues then @entity137 could again be in the hunt for another crown			1
dismissing a suggestion that a fifth consecutive championship was not on the cards , @entity137 said : ' that 's unfair to say			1
' our season testing , our preparation has n't been ideal , and we 're not in the best position for this race			0
' but it 's a different story for the championship because there is a long way to go			0
bumpy road ahead : @entity137 was relaxed during the preview session on thursday in @entity29 new look : @entity192 ( right ) replaces @entity193 as @entity137 's team - mate at @entity101 pals : but at times @entity137 's relationship with @entity193 was strained ' two years ago i remember being on the grid ( on pole ) and ( @entity201 ) @entity200 was 1.5 seconds behind me , but he came very close to beating me for the title at the very last race			1
' so it shows anything can happen			0
that 's why this race is important as any other , and there are a lot of races to go			0
' of course , we know we 're not in the best shape yet and there are a lot of things we need to solve , but unfortunately you ca n't solve them all overnight			0
we 'd love to , but we ca n't			0
' we have to go step by step , be as precise as we can , trying to give the best feedback possible to the engineers			0
' the past few weeks have arguably been some of the toughest for the 26 - year - old since he arrived at @entity101 , prompting the question as to how he will react			1
history boy : @entity137 wants to win his fifth consecutive world championship this season close rival ? @entity2 will hope to muster a greater challenge to the title than last season naturally , @entity137 has every intention of continuing to give his all , even when the chips might be down			1
' at this stage it 's difficult for all of us to know what to expect as to how the racing will look , how it will feel inside the car , how many cars will cross the line , ' added @entity137			1
' we had a lot of problems during the test , as did others , so it 's difficult to have any sort of expectations			0
' but i 'm not going out to simply make it round , rather to the push to the maximum , to do the best i can , and then we 'll see where we are and how far we get			0
' the target is to finish , and to be in the best possible position			0
' as to mindset , it 's fairly straightforward for the rest of the year - we 're a strong team , we have a lot of good people on board , we 've good resources , so we should progress as the season moves on			0

@entity2 determined to win second world title , first with @entity8
