the exact details of the birth of the new royal baby next month will be forever shrouded in mystery			0
however , one thing is certain , unlike many other queens - in - waiting , the @entity6 will have a fleet of medical staff and a range of drug options available to her to ensure the arrival of the new prince or princess is as pain - free as possible			1
by contrast , when queen elizabeth i was born in 1533 , giving birth was considered such a dangerous practice , women were encouraged to write their wills			1
the evolution of childbirth : by the 1940s , men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the @entity27 in 1948 , meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital			1
this vintage illustration shows a proud father meeting his newborn twins circa 1952 retro advertising from the 1950s also shows how attitudes towards pre and post natal care have changed over the years men were banished from the delivery room , as were doctors , and midwives - who had learned their trade from their own mothers - were the experts , rubbing ointment on the swollen bellies of their patients to speed up delivery and sprinkling herbs over the floor to make it smell nice and help the mothers relax			1
@entity53 historian @entity52 , who has appeared on @entity55 's @entity54 , said women were often afraid of giving birth as they feared they would die			1
he said : ' in the 15th century it was not unusual for girls to be married between the ages of 15 and 19 and the average number of children born to one mother was between five and seven			2
' @entity64 was a dangerous time in a woman 's life , and most wrote wills when they knew they were pregnant			1
' an ancient method of birth control was to extend breastfeeding , which is nature 's way of spacing out children			2
' he added that upper class mothers hired women to feed their babies			2
' the hand that rocked the cradle was closer to the truth than you would imagine and among the upper classes it was common to have wet nurses breastfeed so that the mother would soon be pregnant again			2

the couple went on to have nine children , two of them born with the assistance of chloroform meanwhile , having babies in the @entity101 was shrouded in superstition and folklore			0
he said : ' several rituals surrounded medieval childbirth , including the burning of the newborn 's umbilical cord			1
fire was seen as a way of purifying the sinful origins of conception			0
' mothers and midwives also used special birthing chairs , which women believed put them in the best position possible to deliver their baby			2
@entity120 , who is studying for a doctorate at @entity122 and researching maternal and infant health in 17th century @entity124 , said : ' women gave birth at home , assisted by a midwife and a group of female friends , neighbours and family members , called gossips			1
when her labour began , it was often her husband ’s job to fetch them			0
during the 16th century , even queens ( @entity142 's wives @entity140 and @entity143 ) were n't immune from the lack of understanding about cleanliness , and both died of puerperal fever , a septic infection of the reproductive organs that always resulted in death			1
' at the birth , herbal remedies and a drink called caudle , a kind of fortifying alcoholic porridge or eggnog , were commonly drunk to keep her strong during the birth , and possibly dull the pain			0
' seventeenth century women often expressed a complex relationship with the pain of labour			1
on the one hand , childbirth had the potential to be redemptive			0
it was part of @entity171 ’s penance			0
' in reality , however , families were obviously relieved when women gave birth relatively easily and recovered quickly			2
' this treated disk was said to determine the sex of an unborn child after it was placed on the tongue babies in a maternity unit in the 1950s and 1960s were kept in one room to enable their mothers to rest three pregnant women relax in medical ' space - suits ' in 1965 in an attempt to ease childbirth and raise the intelligence of their offspring			1
a suction pump next to the chairs lowers pressure inside the suits , while a gauge in front of them gives a constant reading in 1672 , physician @entity200 wrote observations in @entity202 , a book about contemporary labour practices			0
he wrote : ' let all midwives bee assured , that it is not their labours , in pulling , and haling their women ’s bodies , that causeth deliver			2
but that it is the work of @entity214 nature			0
' remarking on one case , he wrote : ' her mother - in - law was a midwife , and had used her very harshly ; through her unhandsome doings , her body was much bruised , and , by her pulling the infant by the arme , shee had destroyed the infants life ... ' the medical man notes that placenta was placed on the baby ’s head to prevent sore eyes , while at the time there were few tools and a hook called a ' crotchet ' was employed to pull out , often dead , babies			1
a woman is handed her newborn baby during the @entity236 by the time queen @entity91 was crowned in 1837 , male doctors could be present at births although they were not supposed to look at their patients , just touch them			0
having borne nine children , queen @entity91 became an expert at childbirth and is said to have persuaded @entity92 to attend the births , using chloroform as a pain relief for eighth and ninth children			0
@entity247 by 1914 , pain control during labour was an option , although one technique , using a morphine - type drug called @entity253 , which knocked women out and erased the memory of what they 'd gone through			1
while the idea of giving birth in a stupor might have appealed to some women , there were risks to both mother and baby			1
by the 1940s , men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the @entity27 in 1948 , meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital			0
the biggest shift in attitude to childbirth and pregnancy arrived kicking and screaming in the 1970s			0
@entity276 for the first time , conception , pregnancy and childbirth were embraced as something that could be modified to suit the individual			0
some women claim their doctors advised them not to give up smoking as it would help them relax during pregnancy , while mothers with a low iron count were advised to drink a pint of @entity289			1
it was also customary for mothers to be given an enema to ' clear them out ' and women were routinely given a vaginal shave for ' hygenic reasons '			0
breast feeding was encouraged and smoking was allowed on the ward			0
men also had the choice whether to attend the birth or not , although many fathers - to - be still deemed that a labour ward was not the place for men and spent the time at the pub instead , ready to wet the baby 's head			1
times have changed yet again , and as the @entity311 gets ready to welcome his new child , it would be surprising if he chose not to attend the birth , lit a congratulatory cigarette next to his wife or took her a pint of @entity289 for medicinal purposes			0
mixed messages : here a woman in 1970 reads a poster warning of the dangers of smoking when pregnant although some doctors told mothers the habit would help them relax the @entity311 and @entity6 stand outside @entity328 following the birth of @entity330			1
the @entity311 was present as his wife gave birth signalling a shift in attitudes to the presence of men during labour			0
