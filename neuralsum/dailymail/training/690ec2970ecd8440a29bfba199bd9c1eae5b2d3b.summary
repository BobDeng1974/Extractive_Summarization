can it really be 10 years since @entity1 made his first @entity3 start as an unknown 17 - year - old for @entity5 against the likes of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 at @entity10 ? that @entity1 will enjoy his second debut in top - flight @entity13 football a decade later in his prime at 27 only serves to highlight the remarkably young age he gate - crashed the @entity5 first team			1
the teenager played 46 games that season in all competitions			0
on this occasion , and for campaigns to come , he will be wearing the blue of @entity24 – a sight to stick in the craw of those supporters who hailed him a hero from the first burst into the box			2
@entity38 , recognising the need to replace the impetus @entity56 provided from midfield , acted swiftly to bring the @entity60 @entity59 winner to @entity61 for £ 30million			1
it could prove the signing of the summer			0
already in pre-season @entity1 has reminded of his talents			2
a stunning 30 - yard free - kick against @entity67 was followed by a solo goal in the last friendly against @entity69 in which he dribbled into the area , bamboozled defenders , and slotted into the corner			0
stuck in : @entity73 will have to re-adapt to the physical aspect of playing the @entity3 with @entity24 they were the kind of clinical contributions that made @entity38 say : ‘ @entity56 is the history of the club , history nobody can forget			1
@entity1 is the future ; history is history but the future is more important at the moment			2
‘ my opinion , and the opinion of my players , is that @entity1 is the right player to occupy that central position in midfield			2
’ @entity90 would surely endorse such an appraisal			0
the striker has linked up well with @entity73 , who should provide assists more frequently than the finishing touch himself			0
summer spending : @entity24 have signed @entity90 , @entity1 and @entity96 during this window @entity98 a key signing - @entity38 a cutting edge in the final third became @entity1 ’s hallmark during eight years at @entity5 , where he would drive on from midfield before picking a pass to unlock defences			1
he moved to @entity104 in 2011 with 98 assists and 57 goals in 303 appearances , leaving a chasm in @entity47 ’s side			1
but his time at the @entity111 was spent more in the shadows			0
it was always going to be that way with @entity115 the shining beacon			0
fabregas did score 42 goals and created 48 assists in 151 matches for the @entity121 but was far from a regular starter and often played out of position			0
to rub salt in any wounds @entity104 released a statement after he was sold to @entity24 claiming the fee was good business because his performances often trailed off as the season progressed			1
former gunner : @entity1 spent eight years at @entity5 and used to captain @entity24 's north @entity134 rivals combined with @entity47 ’s snub it means he returns to @entity13 with something of a point to prove			1
that might sound disingenuous considering this is a player with one @entity59 and two @entity143 medals to his name , but @entity104 only won one @entity146 title during his stay			2
for @entity5 , there was an @entity150 victory in 2005 but nothing else			0
his standing in the game would be instantly lifted were he to provide the thrust that sent @entity24 to the @entity3 summit come may and @entity38 is the perfect manager to pinpoint such a mental trigger			1
the @entity159 ’s own ego will be bruised from two seasons without a domestic title and he will apply the right psychology to generate a fighting reaction from @entity1			0
you can imagine him emerging at @entity61 this season as a midfielder with an aggressive edge			2
moved home : the @entity39 headed home to @entity104 in 2011 and won the @entity146 title in 2013 with the club robust : the 27 - year - old could be the catalyst for @entity24 success this season by commanding their midfield he will first take the field against @entity179 at @entity180 on monday night and it is then we will see how @entity38 ’s reshaped team , with @entity1 at its heart , is looking			1
@entity24 have not won the @entity3 since 2009 - 10 but are installed as favourites this time because of their signings and the fact @entity38 ’s alchemy is so potent			1
@entity73 will be the catalyst on the pitch and his immediate impact must give @entity47 cause for concern			0
he never seemed keen to re-sign the gem he polished but given he has enhanced a rival for the title a doubt over his decision may linger			0
the clamours to explain his call would grow were @entity73 to help bring the trophy he never won for @entity5 to his new club across @entity134 .			1

@entity39 moved to @entity61 for £ 30million from @entity104
spent eight years in the @entity3 at @entity24 's @entity134 rivals @entity5
@entity47 passed on the chance to re-sign his former @entity5 captain
@entity1 returned to his home club @entity104 in 2011
