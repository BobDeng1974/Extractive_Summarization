@entity0 has brought us the ' @entity2 ' and vegan cheese but the latest developments could lead to cultured designer fragrances			1
experts in @entity7 are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast			1
they hope to use the technology to create a range of perfumes that even the most discerning customer wo n't be able to tell apart from the real thing			0
experts in @entity7 are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast			1
they hope to use the technology to create a range of designer perfumes that even the most discerning customer wo n't be able to tell apart form the real thing the plans were revealed to @entity22 at @entity23 by bioengineers from @entity25			1
rose oil used in perfume is typically harvested from large fields of the flowers planted across @entity30			2
but because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly , which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives			2
to make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible , the bioengineers at @entity25 coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell			1

from these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour			1
they then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions			1
the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the compounds found the scent of a rose			1

the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose			1
and the firm told ms @entity80 that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast 's genome to force these reactions			1
the @entity7 - based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company @entity87 and sends samples of each stage to the @entity91 firm for analysis and feedback			1
the goal is to create a designer fragrance that can be created in bulk and sold to consumers			2
@entity98 is also working on other fragrances as well as cultured flavours and sweeteners			2
' we 're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth , ' @entity102 from @entity25 told @entity111			1
' these flowers smell wonderful when growing on the plant but the extracted floral oil does n't capture the scent			2
' perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using @entity121 's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish			1
' ' the natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients , ' added @entity25 's @entity130			1
' @entity132 chemicals that previously were made via extraction from plants or synthetic chemistry can now be made via fermentation			0
' the mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production : the raw material ( often sugar ) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid			1
' in 2013 @entity148 scientists grew ‘ cultured beef ’ in a lab using cells from a living cow			2
the world 's first test - tube patty was dubbed @entity2 , cost £ 250,000 and took three months to form			2
to make the cultured fragrance , bioengineers at @entity25 coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes produce its smell			1
the then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains that produce different metabolic reactions			1
the key is to engineer reactions that create compounds found in rose scent the world 's first test - tube burger made from lab - grown meat ( pictured ) was cooked and eaten in @entity172 in august 2013			1
the patty was developed by professor @entity174 ( pictured ) of @entity175 in the @entity148 and cost £ 250,000 to produce its creator , @entity148 scientist @entity174 , believes it could revolutionise the food industry and help save the planet			1
he believes that artificial meat products could be sold in supermarkets within a decade			0
similar to the cultured fragrances , the burgers are created in a four - step process			2
in 2013 @entity148 scientists grew ‘ cultured beef ’ in a lab using cells from a living cow			2
the world 's first test - tube patty was dubbed @entity2 , cost £ 250,000 and took three months to form			2
the stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth , allowing them to proliferate 30-fold			0
next they are combined with an elastic collagen and attached to @entity199 ' anchor points ' in a culture dish			0
between the anchor points , the cells self - organise into chunks of muscle			0
electrical stimulation is then used to make the muscle strips contract and ' bulk up ' - the laboratory equivalent of working out in a gym			2
finally thousands of beef strips are minced up , together with 200 pieces of lab - grown animal fat , and moulded into a patty			0
around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger			2
other non-meat ingredients include salt , egg powder , and breadcrumbs			0
red beetroot juice and saffron are added to provide authentic beef colouring			0
first , stem cells - which have the power to turn into any other cell - are stripped from cow muscle , which is taken during a harmless biopsy			0
next , the cells are incubated in a nutrient ‘ broth ’ until they multiply many times over , creating a sticky tissue			0
this is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of exercise - it is anchored to @entity199 and stretched			0
finally , 20,000 strips of the meat are minced and mixed with salt , breadcrumbs , egg powder and natural red colourants to form an edible patty			0
the project was backed by billionaire @entity245 founder @entity244			0
professor @entity174 spent seven years trying to turn stem cells into meat , and was first successful with mouse burgers			0
he then tried to grow pork - producing strips with the rubbery texture of squid or scallops - before settling on beef			0
more recently , biohackers in @entity256 discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow dna , before growing them in baker ’s yeast and using them to create a ‘ milk ’ substitute			1
this milk can then be churned using traditional cheese - making methods to become real vegan cheese			0
real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from @entity269 and @entity270 in @entity256			0
the technology has already been proven on an individual scale			0
last year @entity174 , a professor of tissue engineering at @entity175 , the @entity148 presented the first lab - grown hamburger to create the proteins , the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk - protein genetic sequences			0
they optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein dna from scratch			1
this dna is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk - protein			1
the genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows , and raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast			0
to make real vegan cheese , the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients , including , fat , or in this case vegetable butter , vegan sugar in place of lactose , and water			0
mixing these creates the vegan milk , which can then be then turned into cheese			0
although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals , they are actually made from scratch			0

' cultured fragrance ' has been developed by @entity7 's @entity25
@entity336 coded rose genes to see which enzymes produce its smell
they are now *experimenting* with modifying the genome of yeast so that reactions within its microbes produced the same smell compounds
experts are creating different strains of yeast to see which ones work best
they are also sending samples to perfumers to make precise modifications
