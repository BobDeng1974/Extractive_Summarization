created by @entity6 3d printing specialists @entity30 , who also make ties , hair pins , jewellery and home accessories using the technology , the dresses could signal fashion of the future			2
rather than the revered traditional dressmaking skills of @entity42 couturiers , normally fantasised about by brides - to - be , these dresses are made using a process called selective laser sintering ( @entity46 )			0
