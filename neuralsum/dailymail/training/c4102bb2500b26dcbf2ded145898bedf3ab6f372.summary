two friends have been branded racist after ' blacking up ' as tennis stars @entity1 and @entity3 for a carnival parade			1
@entity5 , 50 , a local pub landlord , and his friend @entity7 , 31 , a builder , covered themselves in dark fake tan , brown face paint and afro wigs to join a tennis - themed carnival float			1
they put on women 's sports gear and were photographed posing enthusiastically with tennis rackets at the procession in @entity19 last weekend			1
mr @entity5 also sported a pair of fake breasts for the event			1
' inappropriate ' : @entity23 @entity5 , left , and builder @entity7 , right , were criticsed for their costumes at @entity27 in @entity28			1
mr @entity5 is dressed as @entity29 and mr @entity7 as her sister @entity3 ' stereotype ' : mr @entity5 , posing above in @entity19 , was criticised by the @entity31 for racial equality ' i do n't get it ' : mr @entity7 , pictured , has said that he does n't understand the criticism levelled at his outfit since the event they have been lambasted by spectators and carnival organisers , who called their costumes ' inappropriate ' , ' out - of - date and offensive '			1
the pair have denied that they are racist and apologised for any offence - though one of the two said he ' does n't get the racial side of it ' and characterised the criticism as ' political correctness gone mad			1
' @entity50 , 33 , who watched the carnival with her nine - year - old son , said : ' that sort of caricature went out in the 70s			2
i did n't realise people still did that			0
it 's out of date and offensive			2
' ' @entity62 ' : mr @entity5 and mr @entity7 were part of a carnival float linked to a local pub , and were raising money for charity @entity19 residents took to the carnival 's @entity70 page to complain			1
@entity72 asked : ' why did n't somebody point out to the white man blacked up as @entity29 that it was not funny or acceptable ? ' @entity76 , from the @entity31 in @entity28 , said : ' the whole concept of blackened face is steeped in racial prejudice and stereotype from minstrels to golliwogs			1
' it is not just a bit of fun , it is offensive to people of all ethnicities and it 's time we moved on from this			0
' these two guys were not representative of @entity28 , only unfortunately serving to remind us of times gone by that we should acknowledge and move on from			2
' carnival organisers banned pictures of the men from the @entity70 page and the chairman of the event 's committee , @entity103 , has spoken with mr @entity5 , who runs the @entity105 pub in nearby @entity106			1
new rules : carnival organisers have promised to vet each costume next year to avoid a repeat incident concern : many who went to watch the carnival , which took place on saturday , later complained online mrs @entity103 said : ' it was inappropriate and had i seen them at the beginning of the carnival i would never have let them go			2
' i do n't think it was their intention to offend people but it was ill - thought - out			0
' she added that she will personally check each person 's costume next year			0
however , mr @entity7 today defended his choice of costume , which he was wearing to raise money for charity			0
he told @entity132 : ' i 'm deeply upset by the story - at the end of the day we were trying to support a local carnival that had died a death and we 're trying to revive			2
' we 're trying to raise a bit of money for children with cancer - a whole bunch of us went as famous tennis players and i really do n't see the issue			0
' quite often me might do things a bit close to the bone - but in this case it did n't even enter my head			0
i do n't get it			0
' ' like something from the 70s ' : @entity19 locals complained that the pair should have known better than to don the racially - sensitive costumes ' we put brown face paint on ourselves - i wonder if the @entity158 had come through behind us with a mr @entity159 they would have been singled out as well			1
' i do n't get the racial side of it - we did n't set out to offend anyone ... it 's political correctness gone mad in my opinion			1
' when asked about the costumes mr @entity5 said : ' i have upset people and i am very sorry , all the guys are devastated and myself especially because i have black friends			2
' i do n't want anybody looking at us and thinking we are racists because that 's not the type of people we are			0
' we never set out to upset anybody			0
i did n't know we were doing anything untoward			0
' from my heart , we will genuinely learn from this			0
