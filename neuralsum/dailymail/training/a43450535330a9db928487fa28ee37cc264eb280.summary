by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 24 august 2013 pictures of a historic 13th century abbey have gone viral after eagle eyed photographers spotted that one of the gargoyles was the spitting image of the monster from the @entity9 films			1
a photograph of the gargoyle at @entity12 near @entity13 has caused a media sensation with its likeness to the creature from the 1980s cult movie			2
reverend @entity18 from the abbey ended speculation that @entity20 had copied his creation from the abbey saying that most of the gargoyles were replaced during a refurbishment in the early 1990s			1
mr @entity18 told the @entity43 that 12 medieval gargoyles which had been on the abbey for hundreds of years but had to be taken down in 1991 because they had ' crumbled and were in a very bad state			1
' one the original gargoyles was sound enough to restore to its original form but the others were too decayed from hundreds of years spouting rainfall from the roof of the building and had to be scrapped completely			1
the original purpose of the grotesque figures was to take rain water away from the roof in the days before down pipes			1
mr @entity18 said a stonemason from an @entity62 firm was contracted to create the new gargoyles			1
during refurbishment in the early 1990 's , @entity12 's many gargoyles had to be taken down and replaced because they had crumbled and were in very bad condition fun : a stonemason from @entity62 was recruited to design some gargoyles for the abbey he said : ' i think it was a stonemason having a bit of fun			1
' perhaps the film was fairly new when they were carving this and if he was thinking of an alien perhaps the alien from the film was his idea of an alien			2
' i 'm sure he was n't deliberately copying the alien in the film			2
it was just a concept of an alien			0
' mr @entity18 said an internet search showed that someone had pointed out the similarity as far back as 1997			0
he added : ' but it obviously did not pick up and take off then like it has now			0
' church officer @entity93 said : ' it is a beautiful building			0
@entity95 gets a bad press but the abbey is the jewel in the crown			0
although only one gargoyle looks as if it has escaped from an action movie the other new ones are equally terrifying ' people will be surprised and delighted by everything they see outside and inside			2
' alien enthusiasts from all over the @entity106 took to @entity107 to express their delight at the discovery			0
@entity110 wrote : ' brilliant ! gargoyle on @entity12 found to be sculpted to resemble an alien from ' @entity114 ' movie			0
' another user calling herself @entity116 agreed tweeting : ' @entity12			0
an alien gargoyle ! ! apparently surreptitiously added during restoration work in the 80 's ! brilliant ! '			1

the gargoyles had to be removed for restoration in the nineties
one was restored to it 's original form but all the others had to be scrapped and *redesigned*
but few people notice the *extraordinary* resemblance to the beast in @entity20 's film until now
