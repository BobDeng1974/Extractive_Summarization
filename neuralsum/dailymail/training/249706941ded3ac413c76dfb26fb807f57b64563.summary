by @entity0 ‘ you 're @entity5 and your captain is scouse ’ sang the @entity2 fans at @entity3 on saturday afternoon			1
it was a fitting taunt towards the @entity5 supporters who were still revelling in @entity13 ’s misfortune when missing out on the title last season , some of whom will never forget that @entity16 wanted to leave their club not once but twice			1
others will accept that @entity5 need @entity16 now more than ever , as he proved with an acrobatic equaliser in his first game since being installed as @entity23 ’s captain on a permanent basis			1
going airborne to meet the ball with an overhead kick in the second half , @entity16 hauled his team back into the game			2
it will be by no means the last time they lean heavily on him for goals this season			0
traditionally that goal would have been the point @entity5 kicked on and overran the opposition but those days now seem depressingly distant for their supporters			0
@entity16 ’s strike ultimately proved to be irrelevant and it will irk him that his first game as official club captain ended in defeat to @entity2			1
@entity25 ’s words of advice alluded to the @entity50 striker not allowing the added responsibility of being skipper to weigh him down and inhibit his game			0
leading the way : @entity16 looked the part sporting the armband during the pre match pleasantries setting an example : @entity16 jumps out of @entity82 's way as he attempts a challenge on the striker jumping for joy : the @entity3 crowd were delighted with the @entity50 striker 's equaliser inspiring the @entity89 : @entity16 led by example on his first appearance as full - time @entity5 captain suits you : @entity16 does n't hide his delight after scoring to cap his first game as @entity5 skipper great captains grow in stature with the armband and @entity25 saw signs from @entity16 against @entity104 on tuesday night that he was trying too hard to justify his appointment ahead of @entity106			1
it is difficult to know at what stage a player is trying too hard ; when he stops dragging his team forward and they start dragging him down			0
in the first half it certainly felt like the latter as @entity16 tried to raise @entity5 from an attacking stupor			2
one ambitious effort was attempted from 30 yards			0
had he caught the shot properly and hit the back of the net , @entity3 would have been on its feet			0
dejection : @entity16 and his vice-captain @entity122 reflect on what has gone wrong after going behind pushing hard : @entity16 's goal was n't enough for @entity5 even as he tried to make up the deficit instead it bobbled rather embarrassingly along the ground and only just made it through to @entity131			1
another shot from range was easily anticipated by @entity82 and a downward header from @entity136 ’s cross was directed straight at @entity131			0
there was no denying @entity16 eight minutes after the interval , however , and he almost put @entity5 ahead with a clever free kick that clipped the outside of @entity131 ’s left upright			2
@entity143 silenced @entity3 , however , and as the @entity5 fans once again drifted away wondering where it has all gone wrong , the fact that the club ’s captain is @entity150 was the least of their worries .			2

@entity16 wore the armband in @entity23 's first game against @entity2
he scored @entity5 's equaliser with an *aerobatic* effort at a corner
some @entity5 supporters have opposed making @entity16 captain *due* to his roots in @entity164 and his *transfer* *requests* in the past
@entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , @entity5 's most natural leaders , all left @entity3 during the *summer*
