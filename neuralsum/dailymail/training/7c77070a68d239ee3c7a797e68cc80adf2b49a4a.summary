a federal appeals court on thursday gave @entity1 permission to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law signed by @entity4 gov. @entity4 last year that would effectively close all but seven abortion facilities in @entity7 's second-most populous state			1
two years ago , @entity1 had more than 40 abortion facilities			2
many clinics have already closed under a part of the law requiring doctors who perform abortions to obtain hospital admitting privileges , and now more than a dozen remaining clinics are set to shutter as well			0
the decision by a panel of the 5th @entity7 @entity19 in @entity20 wipes out what was a fleeting victory for abortion rights groups - a lower court in august blocking requirements of the law that say clinics must meet hospital - level operating standards to stay in business			1
a federal appeals court on thursday gave @entity1 permission to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law signed by @entity4 gov. @entity4 last year that would effectively close all but seven abortion facilities in @entity7 's second-most populous state the ruling is only a stay pending a full appeal , but the court wrote that @entity1 is likely to prevail			1
if it does , the clinics would have to make costly upgrades to meet the new standards and reopen			1
the impact stands to be felt most along the @entity41 border and in the western half of the state , where access to a legal abortion is especially limited			1
the only abortion clinic in @entity47 , which reopened after the lower court 's ruling , now stands to close again			0
that would leave women in the @entity52 facing a 300 - mile drive to the next - nearest abortion facility			0
but the court wrote that ' women from @entity47 have been travelling outside their city for nearly a year and @entity58 made no showing that clinics in @entity61 ( or any other city ) have been deluged			0
' @entity7 district judge @entity63 of @entity64 ruled in august that the @entity1 law would require abortion clinics to spend millions of dollars on hospital - level upgrades and that it was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult			1
the @entity72 clinic in @entity73 , @entity1 , could be set to close along with twelve other facilities in the state abortion - rights groups bristled on thursday over having that victory taken away			2
' today 's ruling has gutted @entity1 women 's constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe , legal abortion essentially disappear overnight , ' said @entity84 , president and ceo of the @entity86			0
under the entire scope of the law , only seven abortion facilities in @entity1 meet the requirements			2
all those facilities are concentrated around the major cities of @entity93 , @entity64 , @entity61 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
attorneys for the state have denied that women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities , saying nearly 9 in 10 @entity1 women would still live within 150 miles of a provider			2
the law 's opponents , however , note that still leaves nearly a million @entity1 women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion democrat @entity108 temporarily blocked the law in the state @entity111 last summer when she carried out a 13 - hour filibuster @entity4 attorney general @entity113 , who is the favorite to be elected @entity1 ' next governor in november , is defending the law in court			1
' this decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the @entity122 to craft a law to protect the health and safety of @entity1 women , ' @entity118 spokeswoman @entity117 said			0
democrat @entity108 , who 's running against @entity113 , launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13 - hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the @entity111			0
the lawsuit in @entity1 is the latest battle over tough new abortion restrictions sweeping across the @entity7 earlier thursday , an @entity136 doctor who performs nearly half the state 's abortions filed a lawsuit to block that state 's admitting - privileges law .			1
