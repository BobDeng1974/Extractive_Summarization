if you find it hard to look on the bright side and your glass is half - empty rather than half - full , blame your lateral habenula			1
scientists say chemicals in this small part of the brain are crucial to feelings of disappointment			1
if the chemistry is right , we may find it easier to brush off the bad times			0
but if it is out of balance , we may feel set - backs more keenly			1
chemicals in a small part of the brain called lateral habenula are crucial to feelings of disappointment researcher @entity22 said : ‘ the idea that some people see the world as a glass half - empty has a chemical basis in the brain			1
’ to work out why some people find it hard to be optimistic , the professor looked at the chemistry of a lateral habenula , a tiny area deep inside the brain			1
@entity22 's research could help in the search for new treatments for depression studies on monkeys have shown the lateral habenula becomes very active when the creatures are denied a fruit juice they are expecting			1
in experiments on rats and mice , professor @entity22 showed the balance of two brain chemicals in the region to be key			2
one , called glutamate , ramps up activity in the area , while the other , @entity55 , dampens it down			0
rats with depression made less gaba than others			0
but when they were given an anti-depressant , levels increased			0
it is thought pessimists naturally make less gaba			0
this would make them feel knock - backs more deeply – and so expect bad things to happen more often			2
the finding suggests making enough @entity55 is crucial to dealing with disappointment			0
professor @entity22 , of the @entity71 , said : ‘ what we have found is a process that may dampen the brain ’s sensitivity to negative life events			2
’ his research , published in the journal @entity80 , does n’t just help explain why some people are more pessimistic than others – it could also help in the search for new treatments for depression .			0
