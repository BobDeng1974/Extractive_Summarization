he was hundreds of miles from civilisation , lost in the burning heat of the desert			2
second world war flight sergeant @entity5 took what little he could from the @entity7 he had just crash - landed , then wandered into the emptiness			2
from that day in june 1942 the mystery of what happened to the dentist ’s son from @entity13 was lost , in every sense , in the sands of time			1
shifting sands : the final resting place of the @entity18 has been discovered in the @entity19 70 years after it crashed there time capsule : aside from the damage it sustained during impact , the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the @entity19 chance discovery : the single - seater aircraft was found by a @entity30 oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in @entity33 but 70 years later , the ghostly remains of his battered but almost perfectly preserved plane has been discovered			1
like a time capsule that could provide the key to his disappearance , it had lain intact alongside a makeshift shelter @entity43 appears to have made as he waited , hopelessly , for rescue			1
now a search is to begin for the airman ’s remains – as aviation experts and historians begin an operation to recover and display the p - 40 aircraft in his memory			1
the chance find was made by an oil worker exploring a remote region of the @entity56 in @entity33			2
it is more than 200 miles from the nearest town in a vast expanse of largely featureless terrain			0
flight sergeant @entity5 , part of a fighter unit based in @entity33 during the @entity64 campaign against @entity65 , is believed to have lost his bearings while flying the damaged @entity7 to another airbase for repair			0
all that is known is that he went off course and was never seen again			0
at the controls : the plane 's cockpit , but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap unseen and untouched : equipment and controls from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site			1
the plane is still in very good condition intact : most of the plane 's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the @entity33 military for safety reasons remarkably , the plane remained almost untouched for the next seven decades – right down to the guns and ammunition found with it			1
most of the cockpit instruments are intact , and the twisted propeller lies a few feet from the fuselage			0
crucially , the @entity107 ’s identification plates are untouched – allowing researchers to track its provenance and service history			2
there is flak damage in the fuselage , which is consistent with documents on the aircraft			2
historian @entity116 said : ‘ it is a quite incredible time capsule			1
it ’s the aviation equivalent of @entity120 ’s tomb			1
‘ this plane has been lying in the same spot where it crashed 70 years ago			0
‘ it has n’t been hidden in the sand , it has just sat there			0
‘ he must have survived the crash because one photo shows a parachute around the frame of the plane and my guess is the poor bloke used it to shelter from the sun. the radio and batteries were out of the plane and it looks like he tried to get it working			1
@entity143 weaponry : the machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane			0
it appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert bullet holes : the @entity155 appears to have been shot at ( left ) , while its broken propeller lays nearby ( right )			1
historians have described the find as the ' aviation equivalent of @entity160 ' well - preserved : the @entity155 's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage			1
the radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane ‘ if he died at the side of the plane his remains would have been found			1
once he had crashed there , nobody was going to come and get him			0
it is more likely he tried to walk out of the desert but ended up walking to his death			1
it is too hideous to contemplate			0
’ the @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 , has been made aware of the find and plans are already under way to recover it before anyone tries to strip it for scrap or souvenirs			2
efforts have also been made to trace any immediate members of flight sergeant @entity5 ’s family in the @entity190 , but it is believed that none survives			0
captain @entity193 , @entity190 defence attaché to @entity33 , confirmed a search would be mounted for the airman ’s remains but admitted it was ‘ extremely unlikely ’ it would be successful			0
the spot could be marked as a war grave after the aircraft is recovered			2
heading home : the @entity177 at @entity178 , north @entity179 , has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future sign of the time : the @entity7 's factory stamp ( left ) and gun loading instruction panel ( right )			1
however , some locals see the aircraft as a piece of junk signs of survival : flight sergeant @entity5 's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage remote : the crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town			1
no human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot 's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane captain @entity193 added : ‘ the scene is close to a smuggling line from @entity236 and @entity237			1
‘ we will need to go there with the @entity33 army because it is a dangerous area			0
’ @entity242 , of the @entity177 , confirmed staff are working with the @entity244 to recover the plane			0
the @entity18 was a @entity247 - made fighter and ground attack aircraft			2
it was outclassed by later @entity250 fighters and saw little combat in @entity252 but performed a key role in @entity64 and @entity254 where high - altitude performance was less critical			0
around 20 are still airworthy			0
did you know flight sergeant @entity5 ? are you related to the brave pilot ? contact editorial@dailymailonline.co.uk in flight : ft sgt @entity5 and another airman were tasked with flying two damaged @entity263 planes ( like this one ) from one @entity190 airbase in northern @entity33 to another for repair			0

pilot of the @entity269 was thought to have survived crash , but died trying to walk out of the desert
aircraft was found almost perfectly preserved , unseen and untouched , after it came down in 1942
historian describes find as ' an incredible time capsule ' and ' the aviation equivalent of @entity160 '
