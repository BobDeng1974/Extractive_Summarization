' but his optimism contrasted with a warning from the party 's president @entity41 that the the @entity12 are in a ' critical state '			1
mr @entity41 also branded the party a ' bunch of nutters ' and ' cockroaches ' and warned : ' one day someone will stand on us if we are not careful			2

in his speech to a party rally last night , mr @entity2 boasted that changes to parental leave – allowing new mothers and fathers to share up to a year in time off work – would create a ‘ level playing field ’ between men and women			1
but he admitted that his party ’s reputation has been rocked by groping allegations against former @entity12 chief executive @entity18			1
he told activists in @entity23 that the party had to take ‘ a long , hard look in the mirror ’ and realise it had ‘ let people down ’			1
mr @entity2 was forced to use an address on @entity77 to tackle claims the party bungled the handling of groping claims against @entity18 business secretary @entity50 will step up his call for extra investment in infrastructure to get the economy moving but he admitted that the @entity12 had ‘ no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women ’			1
at least 10 women had made allegations against former chief executive @entity18 , which he strenuously denies			2
mr @entity2 said he would not comment on the specific claims which are being investigated by two party inquires and the police			1
but he told delegates : ‘ it is right that – following the events of recent weeks – we take a long , hard look in the mirror			1
’ in the speech , to mark @entity102 , he said the women involved ‘ feel let down ’			2
‘ they deserved to have their concerns and allegations examined thoroughly and properly dealt with			0
but clearly , that has not always been the case			0
‘ for a party that cherishes equality and women ’s rights , we have no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women			1
the standards we – rightly – expect of others			0
‘ i joined this party because i believe in empowerment ; freedom ; dignity			2

the @entity143 review is separate from a disciplinary inquiry into allegations by a number of women of sexual harassment against @entity18 , which the @entity12 peer strenuously denies			1
under the plans new mums and dads will be able to ‘ mix and match ’ how they look after a newborn baby for their first year			0
they will be able to take up a total of 52 weeks in joint leave , either taking it in turns or at the same time			2
but it risks creating an organisational nightmare for employers , who will not be able to refuse requests to take off but can turn block the pattern of leave , if parents want to take time off in different chunks			2
mr @entity2 said too often new parents base decisions about which parents stays at home on money			0
‘ it ’s an equation where the answer is so often rigged because , whichever way you look at it , the solution ends up being the mother doing more of the caring , and the father doing more of the earning – even if that is n’t what the young couple wants			0
‘ she gets the year - long maternity leave ; after that , the expectation is she ’ll continue to be the primary carer – so she ’s the one who goes part - time			2
lower pay , fewer shots at promotion			0
work less , earn less			0
‘ it ’s heartbreaking to watch women who feel forced to lower their ambitions for themselves			2
and it ’s heartbreaking to see fathers missing out on being with their children			0
‘ as a father , i find the outdated assumption that men should go out and work and women should stay at home and look after the children frankly absurd			0

he attacked @entity153 as an ‘ old boy ’s club ’ , complaining that both the @entity246 and the @entity247 are ‘ stuffed full of hundreds and hundreds of men and precious few women ’			1
‘ too often , barriers are put in front of talented and committed women to stop them progressing			0
it ’s a male world , made by men for men , occupied for centuries by men and designed to work to the advantage of men			0
‘ and @entity153 is far from the only boy ’s club in our country			1
’ he criticised the legal system , business and the media for being too male dominated			2
mr @entity50 has questioned whether whether the government should ¿ borrow more , at very low interest rates , in order to finance more capital spending senior @entity12 will use the spring conference to distance themselves from the @entity272 party			1
@entity2 is expected to use his keynote speech to target both conservatives and @entity275 , in an attempt to bolster support for his party after slumping in the polls			0
business secretary @entity50 will also step up his calls for borrowing to be increased to fund infrastructure spending , despite being slapped down by @entity282 yesterday			0
the prime minister insisted there s no ' magic money tree ' to fund big money projects			0
but mr @entity50 will again say capital spending , funded by borrowing , may be needed to kick - start growth			0
he will repeat his call , in the @entity292 magazine this week , that the government ’s decision to stick to @entity275 ’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘ economic consequences ’			0
mr @entity50 said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the government should ‘ borrow more , at very low interest rates , in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges , small road and rail projects , more prudential borrowing by councils for house building			0
’ he told the magazine that the strategy ‘ does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit , and may assist it by reviving growth ’ .			0
