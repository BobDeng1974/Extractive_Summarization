@entity2 state senator @entity0 has come forward to reveal his final moments with his son @entity4 , nearly a year after the mentally - ill young man tried to kill him in a knife attack			1
on november 18 , 2013 @entity0 obtained an emergency custody order to admit his suicidal son to a psychiatric ward , but that order expired before they could find him a bed at any hospital the following morning , @entity0 was feeding his horses when his 21 - year - old son approached and suddenly started stabbing him with a knife			1
deeds , now 56 , says his last words to @entity4 were ' i love you so much ' and that after uttering the statement , @entity4 let up and he was able to make his escape			1
happier times : @entity0 ( right ) was nearly killed by his bi-polar son @entity4 ( left ) last year in a violent attack that ended with his son committing suicide			1
pictured with his musically - talented son on the campaign trail during his failed gubernatorial run turned away : @entity4 was attacked by his son after failing to commit him to a hospital the night before			1
deeds took out an emergency custody order for his son , but could n't find a bed for his son in a psychiatric ward			1
pictured above in october speaking at a mental health symposium in @entity38 , @entity2 deeds ran away from the house where he was rescued and taken to the hospital			1
police later found @entity4 dead from a self - inflicted gun shot wound			1
his daughter @entity46 and second wife @entity46 believe it was those words of compassion that saved @entity0 ' life			2
' i like to believe what @entity46 said - that when i said " i love you , " that broke through , ' @entity0 told the @entity56			2
' that he was still delusional , but that did break through , and the old @entity4 heard that			2
not the old @entity4 — @entity4			0
that those things that had taken over @entity4 were defeated			0
' still , @entity0 admits he may never know the real truth behind his son 's motivations that day and he 's still haunted by what he could have done differently to prevent @entity4 ' suicide			1
@entity4 first started showing signs of mental illness after his first year at the @entity67 , when he got dumped by a girlfriend after visiting her in her native @entity69			0
but he continued to do well in school , making the @entity71			0
he took the fall of his junior year off to help on his dad 's gubernatorial campaign			0
when that campaign failed , and his parent 's broke up , @entity4 went on a cross-country road trip , writing bad checks along the way and getting baptized in @entity81			2
scene : deeds was attacked the morning of november 19 , 2013			1
he escaped after telling his son how much he loved him , and ran to the main road where he was rescued by a neighbor and taken to the hospital			2
he suffered 10 stab wounds in the attack his father found the trip strange , but figured it was n't altogether unusual for a young person			0
@entity4 ' parents became more concerned when he took of another semester in the spring of 2010 to work in @entity96 , @entity97			0
his mother took him for a psychological evaluation and @entity4 was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder			1
however , doctors were optimistic and believed he would n't need to be medicated his whole life			0
' i believed in @entity4 , ' @entity0 said			1
' i believed he would snap out of it			0
' ' i ’m not sure i ’ve met anybody like him , ' @entity0 remembers			0
' he was all the things i wanted to be			0
i ’m not smart , not good at anything , not coordinated , ca n’t sing , no musical - instrument ability , no gift for languages , and he had all that			0
i do n’t have any of the confidence he displayed at every moment			0
' but @entity4 did n't get better , and eventually started talking about suicide with his dad			2
' he ’d say , " i just feel like i ’m going to end it , " ' @entity0 said			0
' he ’d say , " @entity117 , i feel like i want to die			0
" ' while @entity4 had supported his dad on previous occasions when he was committed to a hospital , @entity0 could tell something had changed the night before the stabbing when he took out an emergency order again			1
father and son : @entity125 started showing signs of mental illness after his first year at the @entity67			0
pictured above with his dad in 2010 at the hospital , where @entity0 failed to find his son a bed , @entity4 paced back and forth			1
and in the car ride home , he was completely silent			0
' i know he felt i betrayed him when i went and got the order , ' @entity0 says			2
' i do n’t feel i had a choice			0
i did what i did to try to save him			0
' @entity0 ' wife told him to leave the house for the night , but @entity0 decided he wanted to stay with his son			1
however , for the first time ever , he locked his bedroom door at night and even heard @entity4 rattling the door knob trying to get in			0
still , @entity0 never thought his son would actually kill him			2
the next morning , @entity0 got up to shower before @entity4 woke up and started his day as usual , feeding the horses			1
when he saw his son approaching , @entity0 asked him how he slept and @entity4 responded ' fine '			1
' i turned my back and ... had this feed thing in my hands and he was just on me ... he got me twice , ' @entity0 recalled in a 60 minutes interview earlier this year			2
@entity0 does n't remember much from the frenzied attack , in which he suffered 10 stab wounds all over his body			2
life 's work : @entity0 is still a state senator , and has made mental health care reform his top priority , pictured above last march speaking about mental health reform at the @entity158 in @entity159 shortly after telling his son how much he loved him , @entity4 eased up			1
deeds still is n't certain that those words impacted his son			2
' maybe he figured he did the damage he needed to do to kill me , ' he said			0
' maybe he ’d seen enough blood			0
' either way , @entity0 escaped and ran down to the road where he was found by a neighbor and taken to the hospital			1
his son returned to the house and shot himself dead with a gun deeds never feared he would use since he could n't find ammunition to buy for it			1
he 's still not sure how @entity4 was able to source the hard - to - find bullets			1
still a state senator , @entity0 has now made mental health reform his top priority , and has already extended the window of emergency custody orders from six hours to 12 .			1
