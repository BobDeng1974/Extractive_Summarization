the court in the southern city of @entity13 ruled that @entity14 had ' neglected its duties of checking and vigilance ' after having certified that implants made by @entity2 firm @entity18 ( @entity18 ) conformed to safety rules - even though they were subsequently found to contain substandard , industrial - grade silicone gel			1
the scandal first emerged in 2010 after doctors noticed abnormally high rupture rates in @entity18 implants and gathered steam worldwide in 2011 , with some 300,000 women in 65 countries believed to have received the faulty implants			1
victory : @entity2 lawyer @entity30 ( centre ) speaks with unidentified plaintiffs in the courthouse of @entity13 , which found @entity5 safety standards firm @entity3 liable in a worldwide scare over defective breast implants @entity38 lawyer @entity37 ( centre ) speaks with unidentified plaintiffs after the court ruled @entity14 had ' neglected its duties of checking and vigilance ' after having certified that the @entity18 implants conformed to safety rules six distributors of the implants from @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 sued @entity3 for a total of 28 million euros ( $ 38 million )			1
nearly 1,700 women who were fitted with the implants - most of them from @entity55 but also from @entity2 and @entity56 - also asked the @entity5 firm for 16,000 euros each , taking the total claims against @entity3 to 53 million euros			1
the court ordered the @entity5 firm to compensate ' the damage ( done to ) importers and victims ' , telling @entity3 to give them 3,000 euros ( £ 1,700 ) each while waiting for individual medical or financial assessments to be conducted on each plaintiff			1
only when these assessments are finished will @entity3 know the exact sum to be paid out			0
more than 16,000 women have had the implants removed since the scandal came to light , but health officials in various countries estimate they are not toxic and are not thought to increase the risk of breast cancer			0
@entity2 lawyers @entity76 ( right ) and @entity77 ( left ) who represent the @entity5 quality control company @entity3 speak to journalists in the courthouse the court ordered the @entity5 firm ( above ) to compensate ' the damage ( done to ) importers and victims ' , telling @entity3 to give them 3,000 euros ( £ 1,700 ) each civil proceedings against @entity3 took place in march , and came on top of a high - profile criminal court case in april and may in the nearby city of @entity90 against @entity18 founder @entity91 and four other executives			1
all five are charged with aggravated fraud and a ruling on that case is expected on december 10			0
in the @entity3 case , lawyers for the distributors and victims had condemned the @entity5 firm for not ever having checked the implants despite all the means at their disposal , such as unannounced inspections or sample testing			2
but lawyers for @entity3 retorted that it was never the @entity5 firm 's job to check the actual implants , and their task was only to inspect the manufacturing process			2
the scandal first emerged in 2010 after doctors noticed abnormally high rupture rates in @entity18 implants @entity76 , who was defending @entity3 , said the company was ' shocked by the judgment ' and had decided to appeal			2
' @entity3 had strictly conformed to the regulations in force , ' she said			0
the case prompted the @entity121 to set out new rules in september saying inspection bodies will now have to randomly carry out unannounced factory audits and check for the substitution or adulteration of raw materials			0
@entity128 , a former life - insurance salesman , founded @entity18 in 1991 to take advantage of the boom in cosmetic implants and built the company into the third - largest global supplier			0
but he came under the spotlight when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in his products , and health authorities later discovered he was saving millions of euros by using the industrial - grade gel in 75 per cent of the implants			0
@entity18 - which has since been liquidated - had exported more than 80 per cent of its implants , with about half going to @entity146 , about a third to other countries in western @entity148 , about 10 per cent to eastern @entity148 and the rest to the @entity150 and @entity151 .			0
