air chief marshal @entity0 , a former chief of the defence staff , claimed @entity1 is ' testing ' @entity4 's reaction times planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by @entity10 jets in a highly dangerous ' game of chicken ' , a former head of the armed forces has warned			1
air chief marshal @entity0 , a former chief of the defence staff , claimed @entity1 is ' testing ' the resolve of @entity4 and its @entity16 allies in the stand - off in @entity18			1
he accused @entity19 of pursuing an ' aggressive ' strategy of probing @entity4 defences , using flights by @entity10 long - range @entity24 bombers off @entity25 and the coast of @entity27			1
two @entity10 bombers last week skirted @entity4 airspace off the coast of @entity27 , where they were intercepted and escorted by the two @entity31 fighters			1
it came after one of the huge @entity35 - era @entity24 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of @entity25 last month			1
@entity0 said the flights were not ' joy rides ' but ' mission rehearsals ' designed to test @entity4 's capability to react			1
he told @entity45 's @entity44 programme : ' they are becoming more aggressive			0
these aircraft - @entity10 bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides			1
they are mission rehearsals , ' he said			0
' these aircraft launch stand - off missiles against @entity54 targets and just as they used to do in the @entity35 they are practising those profiles			0
' they are testing us , they are testing our defences , they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that 's very dangerous			2
' so we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision , not between @entity31 and @entity10 aircraft , but between @entity10 aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing			1
' official figures show that @entity31 jets have been scrambled to deter @entity10 plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014 , including 8 times last year			1
a third of all incidents in which @entity31 pilots were deployed involved a plan from @entity10			1
@entity0 suggested that @entity4 should now consider supplying arms to the @entity18 government to counter the superior firepower of the separatist rebels who are being supplied by @entity19			1
' @entity16 over the years , in the eyes of @entity1 at least , has become weak			0
@entity1 views the @entity85 as weak all round and that is a very , very dangerous position for us to be in , ' he told @entity45 's @entity91 programme			0
' my concern is that @entity16 is not spending enough resource on defence			0
if @entity16 is weak or is perceived to be weak by @entity1 then the risk of miscalculation is much greater and our security is much lowered as a result			0
since january last year , there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by @entity10 near the @entity4			2
the most serious included : wednesday : @entity31 jets scrambled after two @entity10 @entity24 bombers spotted off the coast of @entity27			1
feb 15 : @entity10 warship intercepted by @entity122 in the @entity123			2
jan 28 : @entity31 fighters challenge two @entity10 bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of @entity25			1
jan 8 : defence chiefs ask for @entity129 help to hunt a suspected @entity10 submarine lurking off the coast of @entity132			2
nov 2014 : @entity10 flotilla on military exercise in the @entity123 escorted from @entity4 waters by @entity136			2
nov 2014 : @entity16 aircraft called in to hunt suspected @entity10 submarine off the west coast of @entity132			2
oct 2014 : @entity31 @entity31 warplanes shadow two @entity141 as they fly down the west coast of @entity4			1
he was backed by @entity145 mp @entity144 , chairman of the @entity146 , who said that all the political parties now needed to commit to maintaining the @entity16 target of spending 2 per cent of gdp on defence			0
' this is absolutely central			0
every party must in their manifesto commit to 2 % spending on defence , ' he told @entity45			0
' that is what @entity16 is about			0
it is passing the message to @entity1 that @entity16 is a serious organisation that is prepared to defend its territory			0
' deterrence is about psychology			0
that 2 per cent figure is something he is going to be looking at very carefully because that is what we used to show that we are serious			0
' increasing aggression from @entity10 has led to calls for military support for the @entity18 government			1
former defence secretary @entity174 has said the @entity85 should now consider arming the government in @entity176			2
but the idea was rejected by commons leader @entity178 , who said that the right approach was to ratchet up sanctions if @entity10 continued to de-stabilise @entity18			2
' we are not planning as the @entity4 to send arms to @entity18			2
it has n't been our approach in any recent conflict in recent years to send arms into those conflicts , ' mr @entity178 , who was foreign secretary until last year , told @entity188 's the @entity187			0
' we want to see a diplomatic solution			0
we believe that that long - term economic price @entity190 and all of those other penalties are the right penalties for @entity10 to pay			1
you have to think very carefully before you send additional arms into a conflict			0
' @entity145 mp @entity144 , chairman of the @entity146 , ( right ) said that all the political parties now needed to commit to maintaining the @entity16 target of spending 2 per cent of gdp on defence			0
commons leader @entity178 ruled out arming the @entity18 government in the stand - off with @entity10			1
