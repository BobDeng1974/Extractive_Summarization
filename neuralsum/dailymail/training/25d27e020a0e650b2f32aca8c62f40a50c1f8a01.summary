@entity0 , better known as the @entity0 , is coming out against a plan to teach children about rape and molestation in schools , claiming reports of sexual assault are exaggerated and most can be chalked up to ' bad manners '			1
appearing on @entity10 with host @entity11 , @entity9 said that sexual education has no place in schools and should be taught at home			1
' @entity9 then added ; ' i think it ’s a huge exaggeration , a reckless exaggeration of what actual rape statistics are or what actual sexual assault statistics are			2
' this all came in response to a measure in @entity41 that aims to begin teaching children about rape , molestation and acceptable sexual behavior beginning as early as @entity46			1
@entity9 however does not think that rape is the issue with these individuals , but rather bullying , and the idea of people not keeping their hands to themselves , which she believes is being reported as rape			2
' and just like i do n’t think sex ed belongs in school , we should n’t be teaching sex ed in school , that ’s something parents should be teaching their children - manners , which is really what we ’re talking about here , ' she said			0
' keep your hands to yourself , do n’t be bullying anybody , you do n’t touch somebody , you do n’t want them to touch you , you tell them not to			0
again , this is manners , this is n’t sex ed. and even that should be taught at home			0
' this after just last month @entity9 said that most reports of rape on college campuses are just the result of ' clumsy hook - up melodrama			0

@entity0 , better known as the @entity0 , has said that she believes many reports of rape are just a case of ' bad manners '
this as @entity9 *disputed* a @entity17 statistic that 42.2 percent of rape victims were younger than 18
her comments were made on @entity10 during a debate as to whether or not acceptable sexual behaviors should be taught in schools
@entity9 believes that sexual education , and manners , should not be taught in schools
