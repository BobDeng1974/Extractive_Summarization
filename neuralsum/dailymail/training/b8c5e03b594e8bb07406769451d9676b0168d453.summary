controversial : @entity0 , the ' @entity1 ' has published a new book with her husband entitled , ' @entity2 ' which argues that eight groups of people are superior to others she gained notoriety in 2011 as the uncompromising ' @entity1 ' - boastful that @entity10 mothers make better parents and ultimately have more successful children			1
now though , @entity0 , 51 , has inspired the fury of the public on @entity15 with her new controversial theory that some races and religions are just superior to everyone else			1
dubbed ' simply racist ' by one commentor on @entity15 , another pulled no punches and called her a ' full blown eugenics pushing racist ! ' others were more diplomatic charging that ' @entity0 has now begun treading territory uncomfortably close to racism			2
' published in the new book , ' @entity2 ' , that she has written with her @entity31 husband @entity30 , @entity0 names the eight groupings that are exceptional in no particular order - and unsurprisingly , the @entity10 are one of the top dogs			1
the other seven are @entity31 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity41 - @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity44 exiles and @entity45			1
clearly one of these groupings is a religion and by calling them ' cultural ' , never ethnic , racial or religious , @entity0 and her husband seek to avoid the hugely controversial criticism this would bring			1
however , @entity0 does identify three distinguishing features these eight peoples have that guarantees them success over others ; superiority , insecurity and impulse control			2
' that certain groups do much better in @entity61 than others — as measured by income , occupational status , test scores and so on — is difficult to talk about , ' the authors write			2
in ' @entity2 , ' @entity0 and her husband , co-author @entity30 ( right ) - lay out their manifesto for how @entity61 is going to succeed in competition with other nations family : @entity10 @entity61 author @entity0 in @entity70 with her family , 18 - year - old @entity72 , 14 - year - old @entity73 , her husband @entity30 and her parents , to promote her book , @entity1 in 2011 ' in large part , this is because the topic feels so racially charged			1
' @entity0 and her husband argue that far from pointing fingers and exulting certain cultural groups , they are agitating for everyone else to follow their example and bring back @entity61 's glory days			1
' @entity1 ' @entity0 and her husband @entity30 have penned a new even more controversial parenting theory and guide @entity0 , who is a law professor at @entity90 launched to international fame in 2011 when @entity92 published an extract from her book , ' @entity95 of the @entity1 '			1
raised in the @entity97 , @entity0 's book showed her determination to take the perceived worst stereotypical traits of @entity10 women as cold and hostile to their children and make virtues out them			2
she wrote that she called one of her two daughters ' garbage ' for being rude and labeled a homemade birthday card as awful , telling her girl , ' i do n't want this - i want another one			0
' she also refused to let her children watch television , go to sleepovers and even threatened to give - away one of her girl 's beloved dollhouses if she could n't learn to play a classical composition within days			0
her book bolstered her opinion that @entity10 mother 's made the best parents and played on the @entity61 fear of the @entity61 being eclipsed by a rising @entity124			2
the book was a best seller and now her new exploration of family seeks to play on the growing fear of the middle - class never booming again			0
she breaks down the ' triple package ' succinctly for her readers as follows : 1 ) a superiority complex : @entity0 believes that any cultural group who innately thinks they are just better than others has an advantage			0
ignoring the wars , genocide and abject human misery this kind of thinking has caused , @entity0 and her husband declare that ' the superiority complex is antithetical to mainstream liberal thinking ... the stuff of racism , colonialism , imperialism , @entity150			0
' 2 ) insecurity : @entity0 and her husband believe that a deep seated insecurity can be a motivating drive to achieving success			2
' that insecurity should be a critical lever of success is another anathema , flouting the entire orthodoxy of contemporary popular and therapeutic psychology , ' they write according to the @entity162			0
' note that there ’s a deep tension between insecurity and a superiority complex , ' the authors continue			0
' it ’s odd to think of people being simultaneously insecure but also convinced of their divine election or superiority			0
' 3 ) impulse control : @entity0 thinks that perseverance and patience are virtues that have been lost to most @entity40 - but still exist among her eight golden cultural groups			0
@entity61 author @entity0 , known as the @entity1 , speaks at a promotional event for her book , @entity1 , in @entity70 , @entity124 , 22 june 2011 ' impulse control refers to the ability to resist temptation , especially the temptation to give up in the face of hardship or quit instead of persevering at a difficult task			1
' @entity31 - @entity31 @entity40 have the highest incomes per head across the @entity187 - along with @entity38 @entity189 infamous first book @entity95 of the @entity1 explored the relationship between @entity10 parents and their children 's @entity193 - @entity39 - @entity40 have historically excelled in business , academia , the sciences , arts and @entity198 - such as @entity199 have had a significant participation in @entity61 politics and social and political @entity204 - @entity203 admission rates of @entity206 immigrant groups far exceed those of non-immigrant @entity61 blacks @entity44 exiles - @entity209 and @entity210 are prominent @entity44 @entity211 - @entity45 such as @entity212 are high profile politicians those who fail at this are everyone not in the magic eight			1
' because all three elements of the @entity2 run so counter to modern @entity61 culture , it makes sense that @entity61 ’s successful groups are all outsiders in one way or another , ' they write			1
' paradoxically , in modern @entity61 , a group has an edge if it does n’t buy into — or has n’t yet bought into — mainstream , post- 1960s , liberal @entity61 principles			1
' straying into controversial territory , @entity0 and her husband say that african - americans do n't make the list because the @entity235 destroyed their chance of any superiority			0
' in this paradoxical sense , equality is n’t fair to african - americans , ' they write			0
' superiority is the one narrative that @entity61 has relentlessly denied or ground out of its black population			0
' african immigrants do better than @entity40 because they were born on the continent and therefore just as the @entity10 believe their 5,000 - year - old civilization makes them great - so do @entity42			0
trying to bundle their ' triple package ' for everyone though is a hard task			0
after spending much of the book criticizing most @entity40 , @entity0 and he husband declare that there the point of their book ' is the promise of a day when there are no longer any successful groups in the @entity61 - only successful individuals			1

@entity1 @entity0 has penned a new parenting guide called ' @entity2 ' which lays out a controversial theory for success in modern @entity61
declares there to be only eight successful and superior groups of people in the @entity61
*includes* the @entity10 are one of these groupings along with @entity38 and @entity31 to name two others
