by @entity0 @entity2 will have to import millions of worms to help restore farmland devastated by floods , experts have warned			1
@entity6 , an agronomist advising farmers on the @entity9 , said : ‘ we ’ve been digging holes in a lot of land that was flooded and we have n’t found any worms at all			1
‘ they ’ve been killed by the weight of the water , which removed all the air from the soil so they could not breathe			2
’ shortage : the @entity9 will need their worms replacing after they died in the floods and professor @entity25 from @entity26 , who has been inspecting the flooded fields on behalf of the government , said : ‘ the soil quality on farms affected by flooding is really bad			1
' earthworms are a central part of our ecosystem			0
but they have disappeared from certain areas and in other places numbers have decreased			0

experts *assessing* soil *damage* on @entity9 warned of shortage
millions of worms could need to be imported to make soil healthy again
