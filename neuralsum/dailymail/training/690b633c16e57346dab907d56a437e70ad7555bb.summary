@entity0 roared with wide - eyed delight as the clock at @entity4 ’s @entity3 showed he had become @entity5 200 metres champion in 19.98 seconds , making him the first @entity7 in history to legally break 20 seconds on two occasions			1
take into account a track dampened by sporadic torrential downpours here yesterday and a 1.6m - per - second headwind and it becomes apparent how much more the 20 - year - old has to offer			1
a prominent athletics statistician suggested it would be worth 19.90 in still conditions and 19.82 with a 1.6mps tailwind			2
‘ i ’m so happy to be @entity5 champion , it was a big target for me , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it ’s really cold and late but i saved my energy from the rounds and to run sub- 20 is great			1
‘ it ’s also really nice to beat @entity41			2
it ’s a great feeling and the @entity43 now have the 100m and 200m title here			0
i ’ll be singing my heart out on the podium			0
@entity49 is so much fun and it ’s an honour to be here			0
’ @entity0 ran an almost perfect race , exploding out of the blocks and accelerating round the bend			2
he remained strong down the home straight , leaving @entity56 ’s @entity41 , a 19.80 runner at his best , to scrap it out for silver			0
as well as enhancing his reputation on the track , @entity0 proved he is a gentleman off it when a woman in the crowd asked for his race number as a souvenir			0
he dutifully got an official to unpin the sheet on his back and hand it over			0
victory : @entity23 celebrates as he finishes ahead of @entity56 @entity41 ( right ) man of the moment : @entity23 raises his arms in celebration after winning @entity5 gold at the age of 20 in the men ’s 400m final the teacher gave a lesson to the pupil as @entity80 , a veteran of the @entity33 team despite only being 27 , beat prodigious teenager @entity82 as @entity83 claimed a one - two			1
@entity84 has been offering advice and ‘ having a laugh in the call room ’ with the 19 - year - old as they advanced through the rounds			1
but all friendly feeling was left in the blocks as he held on to win gold in 44.71 , the fastest time in @entity5 this year			1
@entity82 finished strongly but did not have enough track left to overhaul @entity84 , taking silver in a personal best of 44.75			0
the two warmly embraced on the finish line and did a lap of honour together			0
@entity82 , from @entity101 , was formerly a 100m sprinter and only properly turned to one - lap running at the start of the year			2
he has since shaved an incredible one minute off his personal best			0
on the podium : @entity84 ( centre ) and @entity82 ( left ) receive their medals with third - placed @entity108 out in front : @entity84 ( right ) edges out compatriot @entity82 to claim gold at the @entity28 this was @entity83 ’s first one - two in the 400m at the @entity114 since @entity112 beat @entity115 in 1994			1
‘ he ’s a fantastic kid , ’ said @entity84			0
‘ we were a little bit more subdued before the final but still having fun			0
from a selfish point of view i ’m glad he ’s around because i think he ’s going to push me to run fast			0
’ @entity84 was also 19 when he came to prominence by breaking @entity115 ’s 21 - year - old @entity33 junior 400m record at the 2006 @entity128			1
since then @entity84 admits he has failed to live up to expectations and had not won a major title until last night			2
‘ i asked myself 100 times where that form had gone , ’ said @entity84			0
‘ the pressure put on me by others is nothing compared to what i ’ve done to myself			0
‘ it ’s nice to be a champion now , i ’ve never won anything in my life			2
’ @entity142 held on to add a @entity5 1500m bronze medal to her @entity128 silver			1
