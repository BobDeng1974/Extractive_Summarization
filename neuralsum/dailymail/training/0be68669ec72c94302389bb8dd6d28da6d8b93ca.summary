that is the term used when hackers artificially build up the numbers of views or likes on a @entity5 video - enabling them to make clips appear far more popular than they really are and increase their exposure on the site			1
the number of views attracted on @entity5 are these days regarded as an unofficial worldwide popular music chart , so once it became clear that hits had been inflated , fingers immediately pointed at the record industry			1
@entity5 viewer figures are doubly valuable to channel owners since it is also the primary way in which the site works out how to share its advertising revenue with partners			0

the official @entity5 channel of the protégé of music industry svengali @entity101 , lost nearly 24million page views as a result of the crackdown			1
source : @entity5 the mass takedowns came the same day that hundreds of the site 's users flooded forums to complain they had suffered a series of video deletions for violations of @entity5 's terms of service			2
many speculated they fallen victim to a technical error , but @entity5 replied to confirm that the users had been sanctioned for violating @entity130 item 4 , @entity131 , which bans artificially inflating view counts			0
according to the @entity83 , the apparent crackdown last week was widely discussed on the @entity134 , where visitors exchange advice on unethical search engine optimisation tactics			0

the bigger they come : this graph shows how @entity2 lost more than a billion page views in a single day when @entity5 carried out its audit on view numbers this graph tracks the loss in views suffered by @entity158 : the label behind such stars as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 lost more than 850million views in a single day record labels have blamed the cuts in their viewing figures on a change in the way that @entity5 has changed its view count			1
@entity168 reported how the @entity170 - owned company recently decided to remove view counts for so - called ' dead videos ' , which were no longer live on the channel			0
a senior label executive told the music industry trade magazine that since thousands of videos had in fact been migrated to @entity178 , the views those clips accrued during their time on their dedicated label channels were taken away in @entity5 's ' clean up '			2
@entity2 acknowledged its drop in views , but told the @entity83 its channel had been mostly dormant since it shifted its focus to @entity178 , which it founded in 2009 together with @entity18 , @entity186 , and @entity187			2
