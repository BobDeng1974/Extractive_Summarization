@entity0 has that winning feeling again after engineering a spectacular turnaround in the @entity4 final to end his title drought			0
the @entity6 faced five match points in a second - set tie - break , four of them in succession from 6 - 2 behind , but saved them with some of his best tennis on his way to a 5 - 7 7 - 6 ( 11/9 ) 6 - 1 victory over @entity14 , his first tournament triumph since @entity16 last year			1
@entity0 will be relieved and no doubt proud to have secured his first silverware since parting ways with @entity19 before the @entity20 and pairing up with @entity22 coach @entity21 in june			0
@entity23 has been a combination which has come under a close scrutiny which should be eased by this achievement			0

@entity0 had capped a glorious 12 months with his @entity16 triumph in july 2013 , which came in the wake of @entity46 gold and the @entity48 title , but back surgery later in the year ended his season early			1
he returned to the tour at the start of this year , struggling to come close to the form that enabled him to end @entity33 's 77 - year wait for a men 's singles champion at the @entity57			2
a semi-final run at the @entity20 hinted at the 27 - year - old running into peak form in time for @entity16 , but a quarter - final thrashing by @entity62 told otherwise			1
sunday 's @entity64 title match was @entity0 's first final of an uncharacteristically fallow year to date , and it looked like being anticlimactic for his followers when @entity14 moved to the brink of victory			1
yet the result told a wholly different story , the manner of his victory offering fresh reassurance that @entity0 is lacking nothing in determination to get back to the top of the sport			0
@entity0 had entered the modest @entity80 tier event because of his impatience to experience the thrill of winning a tournament , and to strengthen his prospects of qualifying for the end - of - year @entity86 in @entity87			1
next week he will be in @entity88 , for the @entity89 , before competing in masters 1000 events in @entity91 and @entity92 in october , where big points and big money come into play			0

@entity0 saved the first break point but @entity14 then thrashed back a weak serve and all the @entity6 could do was paddle it into the sidelines			2
soon the set was gone			0
@entity0 broke for a 4 - 2 lead in the second set but was pegged back immediately by the world number 22			2
with @entity14 serving at 5 - 4 behind , @entity0 earned two set points but could take neither			1
that looked to be his big chance , especially once @entity14 surged ahead in the tie - break			0
@entity0 found some sparkling form when the match points arrived for his opponent , but then gifted @entity14 a fifth chance by netting a forehand			2
@entity0 clenched his fist as he saved that too , and a backhand behind the @entity35 gave the 27 - year - old his first set point of the tie - break			1
@entity14 staved that off though , and another set point , before @entity0 gunned down a brilliant forehand that brought up a third , one which he took			0
the herculean effort was backed up by @entity0 as he broke serve at the start of the third set , and from then on , with @entity14 suffering , the outcome was never in doubt			0
