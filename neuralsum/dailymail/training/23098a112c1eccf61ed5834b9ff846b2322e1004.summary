as ministers brace themselves for a highly critical @entity12 report on @entity13 - the biggest rail project in @entity15 for more than a century - the prime minister launched a passionate defence of it			1
‘ i would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country			0
i accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument , ’ said mr @entity2 , speaking at the @entity19 summit in @entity1			1
@entity13 rail line transport secretary @entity27 is expected to respond to a critical report from mps on the spiralling costs of @entity13 next week with a major speech making a fresh case for the potential economic benefits			0
there is also speculation that mr @entity2 may appoint a dedicated ‘ minister for @entity13 ’ in a government reshuffle expected after next month ’s conservative party conference			1
currently , it is among the responsibilities of transport minister @entity41			0
some suggest former @entity44 transport secretary @entity43 , one of the main cheerleaders for the project , could be asked to take on the role for the government			0
objectors say it will cost too much to get @entity13 up and running from @entity50 to @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
the official cost of the project , including contigency funds , has recently climbed from £ 33 billion to £ 42.6 billion			0
former labour cabinet minister @entity56 , ex-chancellor and former transport secretary @entity58 , and @entity60 chairman and former @entity62 mp @entity61 have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks			2
the objectors , who also include @entity2 ’s stepfather - in - law @entity66 , say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage , loss of homes and disruption to many communities			1
@entity2 has vowed to fight back against an ' unholy alliance ' attacking plans for a new high speed rail line but mr @entity2 attacked those who have criticised the project - singling out @entity56 , the leader of @entity78 and the @entity80 newspaper , which has repeatedly cast doubt on the economic case			1
‘ there has never been a blank cheque for @entity13 but i ’m passionately in favour of this project and we need to respond to the criticism that ’s been made , ’ the prime minister			1
‘ there ’s an unholy alliance between the @entity80 , @entity56 and @entity91 who want to give up on projects to make our country competitive and fit for the 21st century			2
‘ every other country in the world has got on board for high speed rail			0
‘ i absolutely refuse to accept we can have a booming south - east corridor closest to the continent and rest of the economy wo n’t benefit			0
’ citing the success of the @entity107 and the @entity109 project , currently under construction , the prime minister aded : ‘ we need to fight back with a vigorous campaign we can do extraordinary things in terms of infrastructure			2
‘ i would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country			0
i accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument			0
’ the prime minister argues that @entity13 is essential if @entity15 is to be a winner in the so - called ‘ global race ’			1
@entity15 lags far behind high - speed rail developments in countries such as @entity126 – which has 342 miles – and @entity127 , with 422 miles			0
@entity129 sources said similar objections now raised against @entity13 had been made in decades gone by to the @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity134 warned @entity50 ’s status as a ‘ global powerhouse ’ will be threatened if the @entity13 rail line does not go ahead			1
the deputy prime minister claimed the @entity15 is a ‘ laggard ’ when it comes to investing in transport infrastructure , and can no longer compete with the rising cities of @entity142 and @entity143			2
following a summer of criticism of the rising costs of the project , mr @entity134 made an impassioned defence of @entity13 , saying connecting the capital to the northern cities was the only way to prevent a ‘ never ending sprawl across the green belt outside of @entity50			1

there is also speculation that mr @entity2 may appoint a dedicated ‘ minister for @entity13
objectors say the project will cause environmental damage and loss of homes
@entity56 argues @entity13 is essential if @entity15 is to be a winner in the so - called ‘ global race
