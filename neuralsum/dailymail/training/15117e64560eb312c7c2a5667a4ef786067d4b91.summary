killer : @entity1 , 29 , has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence , the @entity4 has confirmed one of soldier @entity6 's murderers has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence , the @entity4 has confirmed			1
@entity1 , 29 , together with @entity8 , 22 , mowed down @entity9 in car , before hacking him to death in @entity12 , south east @entity13 , in may last year			1
@entity1 was condemned to die behind bars - with judge @entity15 saying the killer had ' no real prospect of rehabilitation '			1
however , @entity8 was sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in jail because of his younger age , mental health problems and ' lesser role ' in the 25 - year - old father - of - one 's murder			1
now , @entity1 has launched an appeal against his whole life prison term - just weeks after his sibling claimed that the sentence was islamophobic			1
the @entity31 - born extremists were sentenced at the @entity32 in february for butchering @entity9 in broad daylight near @entity34 on may 22			0
at the time , the pair both claimed that they were ‘ soldiers of @entity40 ’ and were motivated by the plight of @entity38 abroad to carry out the killing			0
during their sentencing , violence broke out in the @entity32 dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards			0
in extraordinary scenes , the two @entity50 extremists yelled ' @entity52 ' and ' you ( @entity31 ) and @entity54 will never be safe ' during their sentencing at the court in @entity13			0
when sentencing @entity1 and @entity8 , mr @entity15 told them : ' you each converted to @entity50 some years ago			1
' thereafter you were radicalised and each became an extremist , espousing a cause and views which , as has been said elsewhere , are a betrayal of @entity50 and of the peaceful @entity50 communities who give so much to our country			0
victim : @entity1 , together with @entity8 , 22 , mowed down @entity9 ( pictured ) in a car , before hacking him to death in @entity12 , south east @entity13 , in may last year jailed : @entity1 ( left ) was condemned to die behind bars - with judge @entity15 saying he had ' no real prospect of rehabilitation '			1
however , @entity8 ( right ) was sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in jail ' you decided between you , and in order to advance your extremist cause , to murder a soldier in public in broad daylight and to do so in a way that would generate maximum media coverage , including getting yourselves killed by armed officers who would be bound to attend the scene in the aftermath of the murder - thereby expecting that you would become martyrs and each gain a place in paradise			1
' following the sentencing of @entity1 , who has two children and four stepchildren , @entity91 's heartbroken relatives said ' justice has been served '			2
shocking : a blood - drenched @entity1 said he was a ' soldier of @entity40 ' and was motivated by the plight of @entity38 abroad to carry out the killing @entity1 and @entity8 chose the young soldier as their victim because he was wearing a @entity102 hooded top			1
they mowed him down in a car , before hacking at his limp body with a meat cleaver and knives in an attempt to decapitate him			2
mr @entity15 said he had chosen to give @entity1 a whole life prison term because he was the leader of the murderous plot and had no hope of rehabilitation			1
however , in march , @entity1 's brother , @entity113 , said his sibling should not be forced to die behind bars - claiming that the judge had caved in to ' pressure ' and ' gave the public what they wanted '			2
he added that his brother would ' pose no danger to the public ' if realeased , and would ' lead a very productive life '			0
whole - life terms have come under the spotlight recently after leading judges at the @entity128 ruled that murderers who commit the most ' heinous ' of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives			1
a specially - constituted court declared that sentencing judges can continue to impose ' whole - life ' tariffs in such cases			0
lord chief justice lord @entity139 said the court had held that the statutory scheme enacted by @entity142 , enabling judges to pass whole - life orders , was ' entirely compatible ' with the @entity145 ( @entity145 )			0
sentencing in a number of high - profile criminal cases had been put on hold - including the terms to be handed out to @entity9 ’s murderers - pending the @entity128 ’s ruling , which was given in february			1
the ruling followed a successful appeal to the @entity154 ( @entity145 ) by murderers @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			2
before impact : this @entity160 footage shows a @entity161 about to crash into @entity6 as he crosses the road murder : @entity1 is caught on camera walking across the road , while @entity91 's body lies on the ground fight : during @entity1 and @entity8 's sentencing , violence broke out in the @entity32 dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards			1
above , a sketch of the pair in court last july , the @entity145 held that there had been a violation of @entity181 of the @entity182 on @entity183 - which relates to inhuman and degrading treatment - on the basis that whole - life orders were not ' reducible '			0
the @entity188 - based court did not say that whole - life sentences were incompatible with the @entity145 , but that there had to be the possibility of a review at some stage and that current laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances were unclear			0
ruling : lord chief justice lord @entity139 said the statutory scheme enabling judges to pass whole - life orders was ' entirely compatible ' with the @entity145 but the @entity128 judges ruled that the @entity154 was wrong when it reached a conclusion that the law of @entity204 and @entity205 did not clearly provide for ' reducibility ' , saying that the domestic law ' is clear as to " possible exceptional release of whole - life prisoners "			2
' a power of review arose if there were ' exceptional circumstances '			0
an offender was required to demonstrate to the secretary of state that , although a whole - life order was just punishment at the time the order was made , exceptional circumstances had arisen since			0
the secretary of state ' must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds ' , the judges said			0
lord @entity139 concluded : ' in our judgment , the law of @entity204 and @entity205 therefore does provide to an offender ‘ hope ’ or the ‘ possibility ’ of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable			0
' on whole - life orders in general , lord @entity139 said the @entity128 did not read the @entity154 ’s judgment ' as in any way casting doubt on the fact that there are crimes that are so heinous that just punishment may require imprisonment for life '			2
those currently serving whole - life terms in @entity204 and @entity205 include @entity244 , who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice @entity246 , and serial killer @entity247 .			2
