@entity0 admits the new @entity2 regime is still waiting to see whether @entity3 will send two of his men onto the board			1
the @entity8 interim chairman confirmed the terms of the initial £ 5million loan taken from @entity11 by the previous hierarchy means @entity3 retains the right to appoint directors			1
@entity0 insists @entity2 now have no need for any further money from the @entity18 owner , having this week instead secured a £ 1.5m loan from the @entity21 consortium to cover short - term needs			1
@entity18 owner @entity3 holds an eight per cent stake in @entity2 and loaned the club £ 5m however , he hopes to have talks with @entity3 once a wider review of existing commercial deals with @entity11 – who own 75 per cent of the club ’s retail subsidiary – is complete			1
‘ we ’ve had no discussions with @entity3 or @entity11 so far but , as we have said before , we are happy to engage with them and feel we should do , ’ @entity0 told @entity31			1
‘ they are an eight per cent shareholder and have financial arrangements with the club			0
we need to have that conversation pretty soon , but as yet we ’ve had no discussions with them			0
‘ @entity3 does have the right to nominate two board members			1
it would be to the main public company , the @entity44 , and he has got rights under the first £ 5m loan to do that			2
‘ he ’s showed no intention of doing it so far but he has the right to do it if he wants to - and we ’d have to address that if and when he chooses to do that			0
interim chairman @entity0 ( left ) will have discussions with @entity3 about his involvement at @entity8 ‘ i think , as @entity54 was saying , one of the big information - gathering exercises was to look at the whole relationship between @entity11 and the club			1
‘ there are a lot of relationships and there is a lot of documentation to go with those and we have spent the last three weeks looking at all of that			0
‘ we have n’t finished that review yet			0
i think once we have done that we will sit down , hopefully with @entity11 and @entity3 , and try and agree a way forward			1
’ @entity54 has held off from becoming a director but intends to step into the chairman ’s role providing he passes the @entity73 ’s ' fit and proper ’ person test			0
‘ the processes regarding both mine and @entity54 ’s fit and proper persons test are pretty advanced , ’ added @entity0			2
prospective chairman @entity54 ( right ) has to pass the @entity73 ’s ‘ fit and proper ’ person test ‘ we have said , and we will honour the fact , that we want to rebuild the relationship with all the governing bodies and we have to respect their processes and procedures			0
’ @entity0 also insisted he wants to help build a ‘ modern @entity2 upon traditional foundations ’			2
he said : ‘ people have spoken about having @entity2 men on the board and getting back to a @entity2 way of doing things but i think we also need to be a bit more forward - thinking			2
‘ i am looking a lot at this moment at the structure of various clubs and trying to get a sense of what would work at @entity2 because there are different structures around @entity102 and even in @entity103			0
‘ for example , the structure at @entity105 might not be appropriate for the structure at @entity2 and we need to look at that kind of thing			0
