mr @entity4 , who resigned in september 2013 , accepted his conduct had breached professional boundaries but denied his behaviour was sexually motivated			1
however , the report says that during a heated row , mr @entity4 told his wife – who has now moved to the @entity54 – that he had kissed the girl			1
and while the panel found no evidence of a sexual relationship while the pupil was at school , they heard the pair were now living together and the teenager is expecting their first child			1
the report concluded : ' the fact that mr @entity4 continued to maintain and develop the relationship with student a whilst she was a student , in the face of very clear advice and warnings as to his behaviour , is an aggravating factor in this case			2
' mr @entity4 's behaviour undermines public confidence in the profession and damages its collective reputation			0
in a statement mr @entity4 - known as @entity80 - claimed that @entity81 only stayed at his house once because ' she knew i was low and alone on my birthday			2

' @entity23 , a fan of dogs and reality shows such as made in @entity104 , lived with her parents and six siblings before she moved to @entity11 in @entity108 , with her former teacher			2
the 18 - year - old , who often posts light - hearted short videos of herself and friends on social media - openly states she is in a relationship with mr @entity4 on @entity115			1
it is understood the couple moved to @entity11 because he has family living there			2
one former student wrote anonymously on social media : ' to everyone saying this is fine because he 's not her teacher anymore , i think this is disgusting			0
' mr @entity4 taught me and during her lessons he would always be with her and just put on a film or something for us , he was a lovely teacher , friendly , etc and i feel sick knowing he taught me			2
' another added : ' mr @entity4 was an excellent teacher who abused his position			2
to those who know him and the girl in question it is sickening			0
' i feel for the students that he taught for letting them down so badly in their exam year			0
it is my understanding that quite a few pupils were aware of some sort of inappropriate friendship from year 11			0
' the whole story is sad			0
' mr @entity4 was working at the school when he embarked on a relationship with the @entity19 student , from @entity149 , @entity15 , in 2013			1

' ' after a while i noticed they were hanging around a lot more than a normal teacher would with a student but i did n't really take notice			0
' as a teacher i thought mr @entity4 was a good teacher as he was willing to help you get the grades you wanted and the ones he expected from you			0
' he was a generally funny person and someone you could trust			0
' a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' we are in full agreement with the @entity176 that mr @entity178 ' behaviour was completely unacceptable and we fully support the banning order			0
' the school took swift action as soon as it became aware that mr @entity4 had ignored all advice about his professional conduct			0
this resulted in his suspension and the referral of his case to the appropriate authorities , who have now taken the decision to ban him from teaching			0
