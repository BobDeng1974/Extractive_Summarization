by @entity0 for decades they led the way in childrens ' entertainment and were a constant fixture at birthday parties			0
but the future of @entity9 clowns is now in serious doubt , and it is no laughing matter			2
the entertainers claim an increasingly ' cynical ' public image has seen membership at @entity14 ( @entity16 ) drop from almost 1,000 in the 1980s to just 100			1
they also argue tv characters such as @entity19 ' @entity18 , who is portrayed as a heavy smoker and drinker , and filmmakers who turn friendly clowns into psychopaths , have contributed to the decline which could see the profession wiped out			1
conference cancelled : clowns gather for the annual gathering in @entity30 at the beginning of march in 2007			0
this year 's event did not go ahead after the company withdrew its sponsorship the clown in horror film it , based on the @entity38 novel , and the @entity39 , played by @entity40 in @entity41 , have created an increasingly sinister view of the entertainers , with children relating to them as villains rather than loveable comedians			1
the average age of clowns has also risen , with fewer younger people wanting to take up the profession , and many have had to go part time as work at childrens ' parties has dried up			1
former chairman of @entity16 , @entity56 , told @entity57 : ' there is an image problem			1
there is a very negative view from @entity62 , with films like it and characters like @entity18			1
he added it was no longer ' cool ' for children to have clowns at a party , as parents are opting for television or film - themed events instead			0
' now its all djs and paintball themed - @entity75 's the way of the world , children and growing up quicker			0
cynical : a veteran entertainer has said clowns on tv , like the @entity83 's degenerate , @entity18 , have created a negative public image ' for some reason , clowning has been jumped upon as being unfashionable and the scary clown bandwagon has been particularly jumped upon			1
this year 's annual gathering of clowns at @entity30 in @entity90 was cancelled this year after the holiday camp withdrew its sponsorship			2
attendees usually provide free entertainment to holidaymakers in exchange for free accommodation and food , but falling numbers have signaled the end of the deal			0
children having a phobia of clowns may also be blamed on the decline , but the 70 - year - old veteran entertainer claims he has only met one person who had a genuine fear			1
the problem is not confined to @entity9 with the @entity110 reporting that membership has fallen from about 3,500 to 2,000 in the past decade			2
@entity114 , from the @entity113 films , is believed to have made coulrophobia more prevalent scientists generally agree that coulrophobia is a result of not knowing who lies behind the makeup , red nose and hair of a clown			0
according to @entity125 , research has shown the fear of clowns has increased since the @entity129 's 1990s ' film , ' it ' , which depicts a murderous clown			2
the portrayal of the @entity39 in @entity113 films is also blamed			0
according to the site , the phobia , which can cause panic , breathing difficulty and nausea , does prevent some people from eating at @entity139			0
@entity140 can affect both adults and children .			0
