’ across the entire retail industry , sales were up by 3.9 per cent in august compared with last year , and the total amount spent also rose by 2.7 per cent			0

prices in food shops fell for the first time since december 2004 , dropping by 0.1 per cent over the year , which the @entity16 said was ‘ in part due to “ supermarket price wars ”			0
’ @entity95 , an investment research analyst at @entity97 , said sales figures had benefited from ‘ benign weather conditions and the one off impetus of a rush to buy powerful vacuum cleaners ’			1
he added that the figures show ‘ consumer spending remains fairly robust ’ , despite a lack of wage rises			0
this week , @entity16 figures showed workers received the worst annual pay rises on record for a third consecutive month			0
the average salary increased by just 0.7 per cent , less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent .			0
