judge @entity46 , passing sentence at @entity45 today , described how extreme sexual exchanges between @entity18 and the two women descended into plans to abuse children			1
he said : ' by this time you had all sunk so low and your thinking was so distorted that all basic , fundamental morality protecting children from adult sexual provision was simply absent			0
' @entity22 was told it was to her ' eternal shame ' that she did not react with ' outrage ' to her husband 's twisted suggestions			0
@entity8 , who began an affair with @entity18 following the funeral of her partner in october 2013 , shared ' violent sexual fantasies ' with him involving giving birth to a child for them to abuse together			1
she also shared indecent photos of children , and spoke of her desire to see him rape a young child			2
judge @entity46 said : ' the offences were committed in quite extraordinary circumstances in which two women were so desperate to rekindle their relationships with @entity18 , that they were prepared to indulge his every terrible whim			2
' the content of the messages was truly horrific and utterly depraved			1
' @entity7 and @entity6 ( pictured at their wedding in june 2013 ) had split up but were continuing to see each other when they discussed possible sexual abuse judge @entity86 accepted that other than indecent images being shared , there was no evidence that any other physical abuse was enacted on children by the three defendants			1

sentencing @entity22 , judge @entity46 said : ' you have a heavy burden to carry which you will be judged on for some considerable time to come			0
' @entity99 was given to mental health issues suffered by @entity8 , stemming from the loss of her baby two hours after its birth when she was 14 years old			2
the court heard she met @entity18 at an ' extremely low ebb			1
' the trio were arrested after an 18 - year - old woman , who was in a relationship with @entity18 , tipped police off about messages she had read on his phone			0

the @entity18 's each received six month concurrent sentences for possession of extreme pornographic images involving sexual activity with dogs and horses			1
all three defendants were banned from working with children and ordered to sign the sex offender 's register indefinitely			0
they also received a @entity137 placing severe restrictions on any future use of the internet , computers or devices capable of digitally storing images			0
the conspiracy emerged by chance in june when @entity18 found himself arrested over a domestic disturbance at a third woman 's address			2
at that time he was said to be in a relationship with his wife @entity22 and @entity8 , both living at the marital address			2
the court heard the @entity154 had married in june 2013 , but then separated early this year			1
prosecutor @entity155 said that in the course of graphic text message conversations with each other , the @entity156 had made arrangements and had discussed possible sexual abuse by @entity18 , with her indicating she would assist in the commission of those acts			1
mr @entity155 said there were messages of a sexual nature between those two defendants which progressed to discussing sexual abuse			1
mr @entity155 added : ' the conversations with @entity6 were taking place at the same time and often almost simultaneously with text conversations between @entity18 and @entity8			1

the court was told before separating from his wife , @entity18 had had a sexual relationship with @entity8 for three months			1
@entity18 and @entity8 agreed together to engage in sexual activity with children			1
it was an escalating course of conduct between those two defendants , during which in text messages he requested her to perform a variety of sexual acts			0
mr @entity155 said : ' in further mobile text messages they agreed and discussed in detail abusing children			0
the inference is @entity8 had been prepared to carry out his ever extreme sexual requests			2
the messages planning these sexual acts with children represented a genuine plan of action			0
' @entity8 , who was @entity18 's girlfriend , told him she had had thoughts about sexually abusing a child the night before his arrest , @entity18 had had a sexual liaison with his wife and @entity8			1
in june this year , he was at the home of the third woman , but was texting his wife and @entity8			2
police were called to a domestic disturbance and @entity18 was arrested , initially to prevent a breach of the peace			0
she indicated he was no longer welcome at her home and drew police attention to text messages she had seen on his mobile phone			0
she had been suspicious he intended resuming a relationship with his wife			0
mr @entity155 added : ' they saw the conversations in which @entity6 had agreed to facilitate and assist in sexual activity with a child			1
' her phone was then seized , as well as that of @entity8			0
all the phones were analysed			0
some discussions were found that had taken place between @entity8 and @entity18			1
mr @entity155 added : ' they discussed how they could gain access to children			0
' @entity18 suggested she could get a job in child care			2
@entity8 disclosed to him she had had thoughts of sexually abusing a child , which he encouraged			2
' it 's a highly sexualised world in which he appears to live			0
he is lost in a world of unusual sexual practices where nothing appears to be ruled out			0
' mr @entity155 said @entity22 and @entity8 were ' besotted ' with @entity18 and willing to assist him			1
acting detective inspector @entity247 , of the @entity248 , said : ' i am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes			0
' thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in @entity29 and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in @entity29			0
' after the case , prosecutor @entity155 said : ' @entity6 , @entity18 and @entity8 have been found guilty of extremely alarming offences whereby they planned amongst themselves the sexual abuse of vulnerable young children			1
' they sent shockingly explicit messages to each other , including photographs of the children they planned to abuse , over a prolonged period of ten days			0
the messages shown during the trial proved that the abuse was intended to be made real and would have been put into action once the opportunity arose			0
' all three defendants denied they intended to carry out the abuse they had discussed and attempted to explain it away as general talk about sexual fantasies			1
however , after carefully considering all the evidence against them , the jury has today found them guilty of all the repugnant offences they faced			0
' the cps and police are dedicated to protecting children and young people , and will continue to do all in our power to bring to justice all those who harm them or plan to harm them in any way			0
