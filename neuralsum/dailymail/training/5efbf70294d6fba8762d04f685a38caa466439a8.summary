one young woman made the decision to take control of her weight when random strangers began calling her fat in the street			1
@entity7 , 22 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , lost 5st 7lb this year through an online bikini guide and is now competing as a bikini model			1
at her heaviest @entity7 weighed 13st 4lb and was turning to junk food on a regular basis			1
' i was drinking and binge eating a lot and i lost track of everything and every time i went up a dress size i would blame the clothes shop ' although @entity7 ripped her jeans on several occasions because of her weight gain , the moment of realisation came when she was called fat by complete strangers in the street			1
the transformation that @entity7 has undergone in just a year is quite remarkable , and she says she loves her new lifestyle despite the rude comments , from that moment on , @entity7 became determined to get her weight under control and change her unhealthy lifestyle			1
a friend had told her about the @entity61 plan which is a downloadable 80 page guide of training and nutritional guidance			2
doing a mix of exercises , @entity7 began to learn about nutrition and what food her body needed			1
' it totally changed my perspective on food , now i see it as fuel			0
i 'll look at a meal and see how much protein , how much carbs are in it			0
when i gave myself a week off i did n't even want the junk food ! ' i still use the guide now and i have a trainer for competitions			0
i absolutely love this lifestyle - it becomes addictive , ' she explains			0
@entity7 admits that before she began her diet she had no idea about good nutrition or what she should eat the transformation was n't easy and @entity7 began training seven times a week and swapped junk food for healthy meals such as spinach omelettes for breakfast , tuna burgers for lunch and chicken and goats cheese salads for dinner			1
this dramatic change of lifestyle resulted in @entity7 quickly shedding the unwanted pounds			2
within a year she weighed in at 8st , fitting into a size six with a 25in waist			0
in the gym people began to compliment @entity7 about her transformation and suggested that she take part in bikini model competitions			1
breakfast : cereal bars or toast lunch : a sandwich , crisps and a chocolate bar dinner : roast dinner , take away or frozen meal like a chicken @entity119 snacks : constantly picking on biscuits and crisps from vending machines breakfast : four egg white omelette with spinach lunch : lean turkey mince burger with sweet potato and vegetables dinner : tuna with rice and vegetables snacks : nothing @entity7 enlisted the help of a bikini model coach @entity140 who helped her prepare for her first competition where she placed in the top 5			2
speaking to @entity143 about stepping out on stage in a tiny bikini @entity145 says : ' it was really , really scary			0
probably one of the most petrifying moments of my life to be honest			0
' in my mind i 'm still the big girl i was before , i do n't see what other people do			0
' when i had visited a @entity157 expo i had seen all the models and thought i would love to do that , and when people started making comments about me entering i started to think " what 's the worst that could happen ? i 've got nothing to lose " ' it ended up being really empowering because everyone was so complimentary			2
now i am preparing for my next competition			0

a poor diet and university drinking saw @entity7 's weight reach 13st 4lb
regularly ripped *trousers* and was *humiliated* when strangers called her fat
download an online bikini guide and began following it 's workouts
also learnt about nutritional *values* and totally *re-vamped* her diet
managed to lose 5st 7lb and dropped to a slim 8st
began competing in bikini contests when people at the gym suggested it
now says she loves her new lifestyle and wants to keep competing
