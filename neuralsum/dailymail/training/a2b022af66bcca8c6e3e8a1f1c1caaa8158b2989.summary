@entity1 ’s default mood is bullish			1
troublesome fan ? tell him to * * * * off and die			0
upended in the technical area by a rival player ? grab him by the throat while he lies on the floor			2
the enduring image from 24 hours which do not put anyone at @entity11 in a good light will be of their manager bending over @entity15 ’s @entity14 , his hands round the player ’s neck			1
smiling , certainly , a bit of banter , perhaps			0
yet it appears the choke has backfired spectacularly			0
@entity11 boss @entity1 ( left ) appears to put his hands towards the neck of @entity14 @entity14 ( centre ) slides into @entity1 after he is upended by @entity11 midfielder @entity24 @entity14 ( right ) tries to walk away from @entity1 , who keeps his hand grasped on to the shirt @entity27 pulls away , trying to move from @entity1 , who keeps a hold 6.30pm the story breaks that @entity1 has been sacked by @entity11 @entity30 and ex-players react , with @entity33 tweeting : ‘ not surprised @entity1 has been fired			1
’ 9.45pm after hours of silence from the club , reports begin to leak that @entity1 may still be in charge			1
10.07pm @entity11 finally release a statement saying that @entity1 has not been sacked ... 10.12pm ... but too late to stop @entity39 reporting that he has gone			1
@entity11 ’s @entity42 owners , the @entity44 family , have been a patient lot , backing @entity1 earlier in the season and sacking director of football @entity47 instead , blaming him for failures in the transfer market last summer			1
in january the club went out on a limb and paid a record £ 9million for @entity54 , who started on the bench against @entity15 in what was billed as a must - win game			0
that ’s a very expensive backside and one can only imagine what @entity44 , who made his fortune through duty free franchises , thought when he bowled up on saturday			0
by the final whistle there were other factors to consider , not least the fact that @entity11 , who take on @entity67 away on tuesday , are in danger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table			1
then there was that extraordinary moment involving @entity14 which started as a laugh and finished with a snarl			1
@entity1 smilingly put his hands round @entity14 ’s throat while the @entity15 man lay on the floor after he had accidentally sent @entity1 flying in the final minutes of @entity15 ’s win at the @entity80			1
@entity1 then hauled the player to his feet before grabbing @entity14 ’s shirt and refusing to release him			1
@entity1 ( left ) appears to smile and laugh as @entity14 stays down with @entity83 ( right ) looking on @entity14 laughs and smiles as @entity1 appears to put his arms around the throat of the midfielder @entity1 ( left ) appears to put his hands around the throat of @entity15 midfielder @entity14 ' @entity11 would like to clarify its position relative to its manager , @entity1			1
' contrary to media speculation on sunday evening , @entity1 remains the @entity91			1
reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation			0
' @entity1 , his staff and the first team squad are entirely focused on tuesday night ’s trip to @entity67 and our continued efforts to secure our position in the @entity101			2
' a clearly rattled @entity14 pulled away , mouthing ‘ get off me ’ and rival manager @entity83 came over to see what was happening			1
when @entity1 said he was only playing around , @entity14 is understood to have replied that the stranglehold was hurting his throat			1
afterwards @entity1 , who failed in an attempt to sign @entity14 from @entity106 last summer , only managed to muddy the waters even more			1
‘ he said something to me , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ i do n’t have to reveal anything , do i ? i think i ’m more than capable of looking after myself			0
’ the @entity11 manager added : ‘ i have no problem with the lad			1
he ’s a likeable lad			0
i ’m as disappointed as he was with how things ( his transfer ) panned out			0
‘ but it ’s the other football club ( @entity106 ) which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that was n’t quite right			2
and a certain manager ( then @entity106 boss @entity120 ) , who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut			1
’ the fourth official ( centre ) intervenes as @entity14 ( right ) and @entity1 clash on the touchline @entity1 ( centre ) keeps having words with @entity14 ( left ) as the fourth official urges for calm @entity1 shouts instructions at his @entity134 side during the 1 - 0 loss against @entity15 on saturday 1 - @entity11 have won just one of their past nine @entity101 home games			1
38 - @entity138 conceded this season — only @entity140 ( 43 ) and @entity141 ( 40 ) have shipped more			0
3 - only three teams with 17 points or fewer at this stage in the season have ever escaped relegation from the @entity101 — @entity106 ( 11 - 12 ) , @entity147 ( 04 - 05 ) and @entity148 ( 07 - 08 )			2
21 - @entity138 scored this season — only @entity150 ( 12 ) have scored fewer			0
16.7 - @entity11 ’s win percentage this season from 24 matches			2
that has been the @entity1 mantra			2
in private , with a cup of tea and an off - the - record agenda , he is good company but the public persona loves to pick a fight			0
on saturday , he berated a young local reporter for not asking tough enough questions about the failure to start @entity54 , which was somewhat strange , too , as if he was using it as a dress rehearsal for the owners			0
they stood by him when he got involved with a serial abuser behind the technical area			0
his argument was that he was defending his staff and he accepted the fine and ban for telling the fan ‘ * * * * off and die ’			0
he retained the support of his employers , who stuck by him when he missed out on promotion the first time and who expected nothing less than a relegation battle this season , if ultimately a successful one			0
he also had most of the fans and players on his side			0
in fact , there was nothing in the body language to suggest anything untoward on saturday night , although @entity1 was not particularly chatty with the media			2
@entity1 ( centre ) helps @entity14 ( left ) back to his feet following the incident at the @entity80 @entity14 ( right ) tries to pull away from @entity11 boss @entity1 on saturday perhaps the owners stayed up to watch @entity200 on which there were plenty of scratched heads after what happened with @entity14			1
presenter @entity33 , who tweeted he was n’t surprised @entity1 had been ‘ axed on sunday ’ , said of saturday ’s incident : ‘ it was a bizarre piece of behaviour			1
’ @entity210 commented : ‘ completely bizarre			0
it looked a total accident but it ’s that point , where he grabs him round the throat , that ’s where it changes			0
the whole reaction in the interview shocked me a little bit			0
i thought it would be a lot more jovial			0
you can see @entity14 is not happy			2
’ @entity224 added : ‘ maybe there is something underlying about the proposed transfer that did not happen			0
’ @entity14 took to social media , tweeting : ‘ situation with me and @entity1 is getting blown out of proportion			1
’ on the pitch , @entity232 ’s headed goal kept @entity11 rooted to the bottom of the @entity101 .			2

@entity11 manager @entity1 appeared to grab @entity14
@entity1 tried to sign @entity14 during the midfielder *'s* time at @entity106
@entity14 *insists* incident has been blown out of proportion
the @entity134 have played down suggestions @entity1 could be sacked
