@entity2 police are losing their battle to clear hundreds of @entity5 - bound illegal migrants from @entity6 , they admitted yesterday			1
it follows the arrest of up to 600 mainly young men in the @entity10 on wednesday by riot squads			1
police used tear gas and batons in a dawn raid which ended up with a makeshift settlement being bulldozed			1
‘ the vast majority said they wanted to get to @entity5 , and in these circumstances there was very little else we can do , ’ said a senior officer involved in the clear - out			1
‘ most of those apprehended were released and allowed to get on their ways			0
‘ many destroy their identify papers so we do n’t even know who they are or where they come from			0
’ technically , the migrants can be deported to their first @entity42 port of arrival , but in practice it is not worth the trouble as they just come back again			0
a spokesman for @entity48 , the @entity2 police union , said : ‘ police do n’t have the means to tackle the people - trafficking networks behind all this , and so the migrants will keep coming			1
’ many of those apprehended on wednesday had been staging a hunger striker ever since three other camps were destroyed in may			0
@entity58 , the @entity59 for the @entity6 , also admitted that the tough measures had not solved the problem			0
‘ the @entity6 migrants are today in a geographic and judicial impasse , ’ said mr @entity58			2
‘ the @entity5 government will not let them break the law and circumvent our security measures , and the migrants are not accepting the measures we offer them			2
’ up to 600 mainly young men were arrested in the @entity10 of @entity6 on wednesday by riot squads ( file picture ) despite riot police doing everything possible to disperse the migrants , mr @entity58 said around 900 were still hanging around his region , the vast majority in @entity6 itself			1
despite action which has been attacked by human rights groups , mr @entity58 insisted that the ‘ @entity2 government is ready to hold out a hand , to make a national effort ’ to help the migrants			0
he said any asylum demands would be ‘ dealt with urgently ’ and that ‘ shelters would be offered ’ , although far away from @entity10 like @entity87			0
mr @entity58 insisted there would be no repeat of the @entity92 @entity91 refugee centre which acted as magnet for thousands of illegal migrants before being shut down in 2002			1
charity workers helping refugees from wars in @entity98 and @entity99 have reacted with outrage to the clear - outs , blaming them on a shift to the far - right in @entity2 politics			1
most of the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach @entity5 in the back of lorries			2
once in the @entity5 they will claim asylum , which entitles them to generous benefits , or disappear into the black economy			0
@entity6 mayor @entity118 has long argued that @entity5 ’s ‘ generous welfare system ’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town .			2
