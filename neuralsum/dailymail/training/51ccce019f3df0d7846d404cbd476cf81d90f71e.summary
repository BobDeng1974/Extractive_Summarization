a couple who took their children on a term - time holiday to @entity4 after a ' traumatic ' year have been dragged into court and fined £ 240			1
@entity6 and @entity7 pulled son @entity8 , 14 , and daughter @entity9 , 13 , out of school for a week so they could enjoy some much - needed ' quality time '			1
the holiday followed a stressful year in which a family member died and mrs @entity7 underwent emergency surgery which left her unable to walk			1
while the family deemed their circumstances ' exceptional ' , @entity8 's school did not agree , fining the parents £ 60			1
@entity6 and @entity7 were fined £ 240 for taking their children @entity8 , 14 , and @entity9 , 13 , out of school for a holiday to @entity4 after a ' traumatic year ' mr and mrs @entity7 , from @entity25 , refused to pay , leading @entity26 to prosecute the pair			1
magistrates in @entity29 , @entity30 , said they ' sympathised ' with the couple but imposed a fine of £ 240 plus costs - a total of £ 290			1
the true cost is likely to be far higher , with self - employed welder mr @entity36 missing out on an estimated further £ 300 from two full days of work spent in court thanks to their original hearing being adjourned			1
the couple say they are furious at the way they have been treated by @entity45 , in @entity25 - particularly as @entity9 's school took no action over her absence			1
they decided to take the holiday after a traumatic 15 months			2
three days after the funeral of mr @entity36 ' father , mrs @entity7 was rushed to hospital with a cyst on one of her ovaries			1
an operation to remove it forced the mother - of - two to stop working as she spent 10 months on heavy painkillers - before having a further operation on her toe because of arthritis			2
@entity8 's school imposed a fine on the @entity36 family for taking the holiday , which came after a death in the family and mrs @entity7 undergoing emergency surgery mr @entity36 said : ' we needed quality time as a family as the children had a very dramatic 18 months			1
the children spent their summer holidays running around and fetching things for their mum			1
' if we had been worried about their education , we would not have taken them out of school			0
' as a result of the crackdown on term - time absences imposed by former education secretary @entity84 in september 2013 , headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days ’ holiday a year			2
instead , they can allow leave only in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ each parent who ignores a ban faces a £ 60 fine per child , rising to £ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days			1
failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution , with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months			2
the move was intended to stop families damaging their children ’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays			2
a quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans			0
the couple booked a holiday to @entity4 for october last year , which involved taking the children out of school for a week			1
mrs @entity7 , 47 , said : ' we wanted to take the holiday with the half term holidays , but it doubles in price			2
' @entity9 's school , @entity118 in @entity25 , raised no objection but @entity8 's school warned they could face a fine			1
@entity8 has good grades so the family thought his absence would not affect his long - term prospects			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' my son was getting so stressed out on the holiday , worrying that he 'd have so much work to catch up on			2
' i told him we 'd figure it out together			0
but he did n't get any extra homework or any work to help him to catch up			2
' when they returned home they were each slapped with £ 60 fines , which doubled to £ 120 each when they failed to pay within 21 days			1
last week they appeared in the dock at @entity140 in @entity30 , where they both pleaded guilty			0
mr @entity36 , 42 , showed the court letters and postcards praising @entity8 for his grades and hard work at the school			1
magistrate @entity146 said she ' sympathised ' with the family but it ' would not be in the interest of justice ' to let them off			0
@entity8 's school - @entity45 of @entity153 - imposed a £ 60 fine on the parents , who refused to pay @entity9 's school - @entity118 - accepted the family 's exceptional circumstances and allowed the 13 - year - old to have a week off they were fined £ 240 - £ 120 per adult per child per week of absence - plus £ 30 costs and a £ 20 victim surcharge			1
after the hearing , mrs @entity7 said : ' we think there were exceptional circumstances and while the school argued that it affected @entity8 's grades , we proved it was n't the case with several postcards and letters from the school			2
' the court has n't taken into consideration that @entity6 has lost two days of work as a self - employed welder and fabricator and work has been quiet the last few months			1
' a spokesman for @entity26 defended the decision to bring the case to court			0
' when a case like this ends up in court it is the bench who decides on a verdict and appropriate sentence after considering all the evidence and any mitigating circumstances			0
' we believe every child deserves the very best education and this is why we work closely with schools on attendance which in a small number of cases results in penalty notices being issued			0
' neither school was available for comment this afternoon			0
parents have campaigned for holiday prices to be slashed now legislation stops families from taking time off during term time			0
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to force holiday companies to cut their prices , meaning it could be debated in @entity214			0
as many as two - fifths of parents would flout the rules so they can get a cheaper summer holiday , a poll found last year			2
one frustrated father @entity219 , 41 , was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to @entity221 with his seven - year - old daughter @entity222			0
his @entity224 rant about perceived ' rip - off ' prices went viral , with outraged parents sharing the post more than 143,000 times			0
‘ i think i ’ve touched a nerve with this one , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t see why i should be penalised for sticking to the rules			0
’ @entity232 , from @entity221 , said : ‘ what we are doing is flexible pricing , ’ he says			0
‘ in the summer i could sell the place twice over and the prices reflect the high level of demand			0
