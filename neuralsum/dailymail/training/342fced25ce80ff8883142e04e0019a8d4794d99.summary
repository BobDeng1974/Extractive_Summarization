under the cover of darkness , a light blue van with two huge rotating aerials fixed to its roof drives slowly down a residential street			0
a camera reveals that in the back , twiddling a set of controls that might have been pinched from a @entity11 spaceship , sits a middle - aged man wearing a tweed jacket and flamboyant moustache			0
‘ yes ! ’ he declares , peering conspiratorially through a pair of wire - rimmed spectacles			0
‘ there ’s a tv set on at @entity20			2
it ’s in the front room			0
@entity24 ! ’ smoke and mirrors : there is no evidence that a tv detector van has ever worked the camera pans out to show a team of sinister looking heavies leaping from the van			1
‘ if you do n’t have a tv licence , it wo n’t take us long to find you , ’ a narrator informs viewers			2
‘ do n’t get a fine			0
get a licence ! ’ this famous 20 - second advert aired on the @entity42 hundreds of times during the @entity44 , becoming as embedded in contemporary culture as parka jackets , sideburns and the @entity48			1
terrified by its depiction of vans that could see through living room walls , a generation of @entity54 was cowed into lining up at the @entity55 to buy a tv licence			1
so far , so effective ; yet conspiracy theorists have long maintained that the menacing tv commercial is actually a cynical and deeply misleading piece of government propaganda			2
the ubiquitous tv detector van that it portrays does n’t really exist , they claim			1
indeed , the supposedly commonplace vehicles have never been widely used on @entity54 ’s streets			0
many believe they were paraded across tv screens — and are still used in press releases — as part of a dishonest pr stunt			2
the chance of one driving down your street is almost nil , they allege			0
historic : the @entity76 was first introduced in 1952 ‘ detector vans are a myth , ’ the @entity78 mep @entity77 , a long - time campaigner against the licence fee , told me this week			1
‘ prosecution [ for not having a tv licence ] depends on the accused being caught in the act of watching live broadcasts , or admitting to it			2
the non-existent threat of @entity90 evidence is just a means of getting suspects to incriminate themselves			0
’ sceptics such as @entity77 point out there is n’t a single documented case in @entity54 legal history in which so - called ‘ detection evidence ’ from vans has been used to prosecute a licence fee evader			1
this was , sheepishly , confirmed by the @entity42 in 2011 in response to a ( hitherto unreported ) @entity103 request			1
advances : the vans upgraded many times , but it is claimed their equipment has always been ineffective sceptics also wonder why the @entity42 has always refused to either say how many of the vehicles it owns , or to answer questions about how they work , who operates them , and where they are used			1
instead , the @entity118 ’s spokesmen have for decades told reporters that revealing such information ‘ might be useful to people trying to evade the licence fee ’			0
all of which has only added to the weight of doubt regarding the very existence of the vans			2
this week the subject was thrown into the news following the leak of an internal @entity42 memo			1
the 18 - page document , obtained by the @entity135 , laid bare in great detail @entity118 ’s on - going efforts to target unlicensed viewers , more and more of whom are being pursued for evasion because they do n’t realise you need a licence to watch live tv on smartphones or tablets			2
it revealed , for example , there are currently 334 ‘ enforcement officers ’ working in the @entity54 , an increase of 20 per cent on last year			2
on patrol : former drivers have said the vans would go out solely to be seen , and would often not have their equipment switched on meanwhile , roughly 5.8 per cent of households evade the £ 145.50 licence fee , up from 5.2 per cent in 2012			2
yet nowhere in this detailed and supposedly authoritative document was there a single mention of the fabled tv detector vans , or of how they may be catching cheats			1
the revelation was seized upon by media commentators			0
one national newspaper reported it under the headline : ‘ tv detector vans : a work of fiction ? ’ in response , the @entity42 insisted the vans ‘ do exist ’ but refused to answer further questions			1
so what has been going on ? this week , more than 60 years after tv detector vans were first unveiled , i managed to establish the truth behind the use of these controversial surveillance vehicles			1
the key to the mystery lay not with the @entity42 , but in the archives of the @entity183 ( @entity183 ) , an organisation of 200 enthusiasts devoted to cars , vans and lorries owned by the postal service			1
@entity189 , editor of the club ’s newsletter , explained that , until 2002 , the @entity192 was in charge of tv licence collection and enforcement			2
and , he told me : ‘ we know details about every vehicle it used , including their serial number , going back to 1906			0
’ the club therefore has records of every single tv detector van that was in operation between 1952 , when they were first rolled - out , to 2002 , when the @entity192 lost the contract for licence enforcement			1
these confirm some vehicles existed — but there have never been more than 20 or so at any one time			0
this appears to confirm suspicions that detector vans always were — and almost certainly still are — largely a propaganda tool			1
their story begins in the @entity219 , when the @entity55 announced , with some fanfare , it had acquired a ‘ fleet ’ of converted @entity223 and @entity224 estate cars , which had vast triangular aerials attached to their roofs			0
in the event , however , the @entity183 records reveal that only nine of these were ever in service			0
the early @entity232 saw another ‘ fleet ’ of @entity235 detector vans unveiled with great fanfare			1
but , again , archives show that only 11 of these were used at any one time			0
a few years later , another ten @entity240 were introduced , bringing the total number of detector vans to 21			1
this quantity was maintained throughout the @entity244 , @entity245 ( when first @entity246 and then @entity247 supplied new vans ) and @entity249 , when eventually @entity250 were introduced			2
it continued until 2002 , when licence enforcement was handed to the outsourcing firm @entity253			0
given that roughly 4,000 people are prosecuted for licence fee evasion every week , the usefulness of detector vans , in tracking down offenders , is highly debatable			1
indeed , tv licensing catches all but a tiny minority of cheats by the very low - tech technique of sending inspectors to knock on their doors			2
although ‘ enforcement officers ’ have no official powers of entry , they are trained in either talking their way across the threshold , or tricking homeowners into confessing they have been watching tv illegally			2
vintage car enthusiast @entity274 owns one of the few @entity244 detector vans still in existence , a converted @entity279			1
he worked in tv licence enforcement in @entity281 for four years in the early @entity245 , but never saw a single detector van			1
@entity274 adds , however , that his father occasionally used one while doing the same job in the @entity232			0
‘ i ’ve talked to @entity286 and a lot of other people who worked in them and the whole point of the vans was their scare factor , ’ he tells me			2
‘ they ’d put adverts in the local paper saying “ tv detector vans are coming to your town ”			1
then they would be driven around with their huge yellow aerials going around , to make sure they were seen			0
’ the detection equipment on the vans theoretically worked by picking up a signal that was emitted by the oscillator on tv sets			1
however , it was notoriously hard to operate , and almost useless at pinpointing televisions in blocks of flats and terraced homes , where there would be many tvs in close proximity			0
indeed , an un-named caller to @entity317 this week , who said he worked on one such vehicle in the @entity245 and @entity249 , claimed the equipment was rarely switched on			0
he said : ‘ there were aerials on the roof , connected to nothing			0
we called it flag - waving : driving around to show people we were about			0
’ other recent correspondents to newspapers have suggested many vans carried no equipment at all			0
since 2002 , when the @entity192 stopped running vans , analogue tvs have been replaced by digital ones , so old detection equipment would be obsolete			0
meanwhile , hostility to the licence fee has grown in tandem with the explosion in @entity340 and satellite channels , which means people spend less time watching the @entity42			1
in a bid to persuade them to pay up , the @entity118 claims today ’s enforcement officers have hand - held detectors that can pinpoint @entity314 ‘ within 20 seconds ’			0
but they refuse to explain how these devices work or how many are in use			0
the number of detection vans is also a secret			0
however , a 2009 procurement document seen by the @entity192 states the @entity42 was at this time seeking to ‘ enhance the current fleet of vans by building a further fleet of vans ( minimum five ) ’			1
that suggests there could be as few as ten in operation — one for every 2.5 million households			0
interestingly , the @entity42 has since given evidence to the information commissioner arguing ( successfully ) that it should not be required to disclose details of the fleet under the @entity367			1
its submission , which has again been seen by this newspaper , argues that making such information public would ‘ change the public ’s perception of the effectiveness of detector vans ’			1
it further warns : ‘ if the deterrent effect of television detector vans is lost			1
a significant number of people would decide not to pay their licence fee			0
’ in other words , if the truth about these sinister vehicles which supposedly haunt our cul - de - sacs — not to mention the men in moustaches who operate them — ever gets out , then the @entity42 reckons we ’ll stop being scared of them .			1

detector vans were heavily promoted by the @entity42 , who claimed they can detect working tv sets
it has even been claimed they are almost entirely ineffective
@entity42 has *avoided* *spelling* out how many detector vans there are
but they have never led to a single person being *punished*
