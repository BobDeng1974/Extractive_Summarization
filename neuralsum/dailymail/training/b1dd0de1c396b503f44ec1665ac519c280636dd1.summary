by @entity0 for @entity1 transgender model @entity2 has opened up about her decision to finally come clean with her birth gender during a powerful @entity7 talk in march , 12 years into her career as a successful lingerie model			1
' i carried the paranoia [ of being found out ] with me every day , ' the 30 - year - old @entity11 - based model tells @entity14 , explaining that in part , she wanted to beat the ' salacious gossip pages ' who could discover her secret at any time ; a secret that even her own modeling agency did n't know			1
' there was always that fear : what if people found out ? they 'd think i 'd duped them , and maybe i 'd lose my regular clients			2
it could ruin my career			0
' despite her fears that the truth could ruin her career , miss @entity2 's @entity7 earned her a standing ovation , over two million online views , and widespread positive attention			1
the commitment to go public struck her while she was in @entity53 , @entity54 , on her 30th birthday last year			0
' i do n't give a damn anymore			0
i 'm ready to share my full journey as a woman , ' she told her boyfriend at the time			2
transformed : ' i was assigned a boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia , ' the model announced in march , pictured as a child in the @entity66 ( left ) and june 4 ( right ) her agent at @entity68 , @entity69 , was ' stunned ' when he heard the news , having had ' no idea ' his model had been born a boy , but gives her ' a lot of credit ' for her brave public announcement			1
miss @entity2 was born to a working - class family in the @entity79 region of the @entity66 , and never once felt either like a boy or a ' gay ' boy			1
fortunately - unlike so many others , she points out - she not only had the unwavering support of both parents from a young age , but she lived in a part of the world where the transgender community thrives			2
' i do n't give a damn anymore			0
i 'm ready to share my full journey as a woman ' still , miss @entity2 went to a catholic school and was required to wear a boys uniform - which she altered to at least fit her in a more feminine way - and was still teased and insulted on occasion			1
at the age of 15 , miss @entity2 was encouraged to compete in a prestigious transgender pageant , and came second			1
she went on to win many more , and used her earnings to buy hormones that helped her grow breasts and adopt more womanly attributes ; in spite of her fears for the drugs ' safety			0
she was 17 when she moved to the @entity107 to join her mother in @entity109			1
to her enormous delight , the move meant she could change her name and identify as a ' female ' on immigration records			0
receiving her female driver 's license was a moment she will never forget			0
' getting that license , to me , was a license to live , ' she recalls			0
the big reveal : just two minutes into her @entity7 ( pictured ) miss @entity121 spilled the news , triggering a standing ovation , two million online views , and widespread acceptance not long afterwards , miss @entity2 had her sexual reassignment surgery , which she says rendered her ' perfect down there ' , and moved to @entity11 to fulfill her dream of becoming a model			1
' when i became a model i thought i had finally achieved the dream that i had always wanted since i was little , ' she said in her ted talk			1
' my outside self finally matched my inner self			0
' ' if someone had asked , i would have told them			2
it was n't about passing as a woman ' her slender , balanced proportions found her much work with lingerie brands - an ' ultimate validation ' of her femininity , she says - and she went on to model for clients including @entity148			2
crucially , moving to a new city as a new woman meant miss @entity2 could make new friends without disclosing any details of her old self			1
' if someone had asked , i would have told them , ' she says			2
' it was n't about passing as a woman , about " nobody can tell			0
" it was about expressing my unique femininity			0
' she did make sure to inform men who she was in relationships with , which prompted mixed responses			0
moving on up : after the @entity7 talk , miss @entity2 ( pictured last month ) co-founded @entity167 , a global awareness campaign that fights for transgender rights one man , upon being told , drove miss @entity2 home in silence before simply remarking that her ' big knees ' should have given her away			1
another much more serious boyfriend , however , reacted by hugging her and thanking her for her courage			0
that relationship later dissolved because the pair were at ' different phases ' in their lives			0
it was a different , more recent boyfriend , who prompted her to share her story with the world as they sat on the beach in @entity54 together			0
after the @entity7 talk , miss @entity2 co-founded @entity167 ; a global awareness campaign that fights for transgender rights			1
according to her , 89per cent of people in the @entity107 currently believe that transgender people deserve the same rights and legal protections as others			2
despite this encouraging statistic , miss @entity2 feels there is ' still a long way to go ' - something that parents of transgender children especially need to recognize			1
' having the space to self - identify with a gender we were n't born with is a conversation we should have with parents , with colleagues , with friends			1
' there is still a lot of work that needs to be done			0
parents need to approach a child [ during gender self - identity ] with curiosity and openness			2

miss @entity2 was born in the @entity66 and moved to the @entity107 when she was 17 , where she *underwent* sexual *re-assignment* surgery
she became a @entity11 model when she was 21 , and told almost no - one about her birth gender
