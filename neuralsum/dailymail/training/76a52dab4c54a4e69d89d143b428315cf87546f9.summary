it is believed to be the first stealth drone capable of operating in the water			1
this 35 foot long boat is designed to invisibly glide across the ocean acting as a spy and spotting pirates			0
the daunting vessel belongs to the world ’s first fleet of remote - controlled ‘ robo - boats ’ designed to take on dangerous covert missions without endangering the lives of crew			1
there are currently unmanned vessels at sea in the form of drones , small craft that are used for military operations and more recently for survey work			2
for instance , the @entity23 unmanned surveillance vessels ( pictured ) are invisible to radar and can operate 24 hours a day they are 35ft long and can operate for 24 hours a day			1
they can travel at 60mph and have a range of 600 nautical miles			1
they are able to loiter at low speeds for 10 days without needing to refuel			2
the drones are powered by two 500 horsepower water jets and boast £ 650,000 giroscopic hd cameras			2
they can be decked out with a high powered fire hose , a cannon that fires nets to foul propellers and a 50 calibre gun			0
they use infrared cameras to see in the dark and they can identify chemical matter and underwater mines			0
the most expensive model costs £ 2 million			0
they are remote controlled so can operate without a crew			1
looking like a cross between a miniature warship and a stealth bomber , they are the waterborne equivalent of the unmanned drone planes used by the @entity54 and @entity56 military in the fight against terror			2
the @entity23 unmanned surveillance vessels are invisible to radar , can operate 24 hours a day , travel at 60mph and can be kitted out with enough weaponry to blow adversaries out of the water			1
the cutting edge boats boast state - of - the - art technology that allows it to undertake search and rescue missions or patrol dangerous waters without requiring crew			0
they have a range of up to 600 nautical miles and can loiter at low speeds for 10 days without refuelling			1
powered by two 500 horsepower water jets made by @entity75 , the @entity23 range also boast £ 650,000 giroscopic hd cameras which take pictures of their surroundings , analysing them for potential threats and and relaying information back to a manned control station			1
the boats can be decked out with weaponry including a high powered fire hose , a cannon that fires nets to foul propellers and even a 50 calibre gun			0
the daunting vessel belongs to the world 's first fleet of remote - controlled ' robo - boats ' designed to take on dangerous covert missions without endangering the lives of crew they can see in the dark thanks to infrared cameras and can also identify radiological and chemical matter , detect underwater mines and profile the sea bed			1
as well as the 35ft @entity105 model , the fleet features a 3 - metre jet - ski style boat called the @entity107 that can be deployed from another boat and a 35ft semi-inflatable powerboat named @entity110 capable of operating with crew or unmanned			1
the price tag starts at £ 260,000 for a basic @entity107 - and goes up to a whopping £ 2 million for the basic @entity105 boat			0
the boats can operate by remote control and can also be programmed to carry out missions entirely on their own			2
the @entity23 unmanned surveillance vessels are invisible to radar , can operate 24 hours a day , travel at 60mph and can be kitted out with enough weaponry to blow adversaries out of the water the fleet has been designed by engineers in @entity125 by @entity56 military robotics experts @entity126			1
@entity128 , spokesman for @entity129 , said : ' our fleet of @entity132 is unique			0
various companies have prototype boats but none offer a whole fleet			0
' the size and type of @entity132 depends very much on the kind of mission you want to send it on			0
' we have something for everything - our fleet is the first in the world			0
the drones have a range of up to 600 nautical miles and can loiter at low speeds for 10 days without refuelling ' they use cutting edge technology to carry out high speed chases and provide top level surveillance while at the same time operating totally undetected			1
' unlike with manned boats you do n’t have to worry about a crew getting sea sick , tired or even scared			0
' the boats themselves are built with a radar reflective superstructure allowing them to scatter radar signals rather than bouncing them back			0
' they can travel in shallow water or deep oceans , and are barely affected by weather			2
' we believe our boats will be at the forefront of the fight against piracy , and crucial to search and rescue missions around the world			0
' powered by two 500 horsepower water jets made by @entity75 , the @entity23 range also boast £ 650,000 giroscopic hd cameras which take pictures of their surroundings			1

the @entity23 fleet are the first stealth drones capable of operating in water
they are remote controlled , invisible to radar and can travel at 60mph
range of 600 nautical miles and can loiter for ten days without refuelling
