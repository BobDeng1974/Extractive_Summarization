by @entity1 reporter published : 14:24 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 20:06 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 is suing @entity4 for allegedly disseminating a copy of his script for prospective new film @entity8			1
the 50 - year - old director filed a lawsuit on monday alleging contributory copyright infringement after @entity4 's @entity4 blog posted a link to another site with the caption : ' here is the leaked @entity17			1
' the @entity19 - winning screenwriter was so furious at the leak , which happened last week , that he threatened to halt production on the @entity8 , described as a 70mm ensemble @entity22			2
lawsuit : @entity3 , pictured with a friend at sunday 's @entity25 , furious after his screenplay for @entity27 was leaked to two websites according to @entity30 , @entity3 's complaint states : ' this action is necessitated by @entity4 ’s , and the other defendants ’ , blatant copyright infringement by their promotion and dissemination of unauthorized downloadable copies of the leaked unreleased complete screenplay for @entity3 ’s motion picture @entity27			1
' @entity4 has made a business of predatory journalism , violating people ’s rights to make a buck			1
this time they went too far			2
' rather than merely publishing a news story reporting that @entity46 ’s screenplay may have been circulating in @entity47 without his permission , @entity4 crossed the journalistic line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the entire screenplay illegally			1
' the lawsuit then complains about the use of ' multiple direct links ' to an ' anonymous url ' which were posted via @entity4 and also on the @entity4 website			1
it criticises @entity4 's invitation for the reader to ' enjoy ' reading the script			1
refute : @entity4 posted its own response on monday to @entity3 's lawsuit it further alleges that @entity4 ignored repeated requests to remove the links to the screenplay			1
@entity19 winning : the director is famed for his screenplays , having won two @entity19 in a response to the allegations , @entity4 published a post on monday refuting any suggestion they ' leaked ' the script themselves			1
they claim they were merely reporting that the screenplay existed on two different websites			2
@entity4 mention that @entity3 himself told @entity80 in an interview that he ' likes ' his scripts to be available for fans to critique on the @entity84 , although admittedly , the @entity80 piece states that the director ' ca n't believe ' it happened this early in the film making process			1
' i am not talking out of both sides of my mouth , because i do like the fact that everyone eventually posts it , gets it and reviews it on the net , ' the director told @entity80			2
' frankly , i would n’t want it any other way			2
i like the fact that people like my s * * * , and that they go out of their way to find it and read it			0
but i gave it to six motherf * * * * * people ! starting this week , i ’ll be setting meetings with publishers			0
' @entity4 also alleges the leaked script is part of a ' shrewd publicity ' strategy ' by the director and insists it ' published a link to the script because it was news			1
' they add : ' the leak of @entity27 - and the content of the script - had been widely dissected online and was a topic of heated conversation among @entity4 readers			1
' news of the fact that it existed on the internet advanced a story that @entity3 himself had launched , and our publication of the link was a routine and unremarkable component of our job : making people aware of news and information about which they are curious			1
' @entity4 are also vehement they had ' nothing to do with the appearance of @entity27 script on the internet ' and have ' no idea ' how the websites in question got hold of the script			1
@entity3 told deadline last tuesday that he was ' very very depressed ' about the leak			0
' i finished a script , a first draft , and i did n’t mean to shoot it until next winter , a year from now			1
i gave it to six people , and apparently it ’s gotten out today , ' he said			0
i like your work : @entity3 favourite @entity158 was reportedly being courted for a role in the @entity22 he found out about the leak when his agent started fielding calls from representatives looking to tout their clients for a role in the film			0
' i gave it to one of the producers on @entity170 , @entity171 , and he let an agent come to his house and read it , ' @entity3 said			0
' that ’s a betrayal , but not crippling because the agent did n’t end up with the script			1
there is an ugly maliciousness to the rest of it			0
i gave it to three actors : @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186			0
the one i know did n’t do this is @entity186			0
' one of the others let their agent read it , and that agent has now passed it on to everyone in @entity47			0
' according to @entity197 , actors @entity158 was being courted for a role , but was never given the script			2
neither was @entity201 , one of the @entity204 writer 's favourite collaborators			0
enjoying the genre : @entity3 said he wanted to made another @entity22 after his experience shooting @entity170 which starred @entity158 and @entity207 @entity3 said he suspects the leak came from @entity185 's agency , @entity209			0
however , a representative for the agency ' vehemently denied ' any involvement when asked by @entity80 , pointing out that the script lacked the customary watermark used for security purposes			2
the @entity170 screenwriter then said he would publish the script and revisit it down the road as a potential movie			2
' i ’ll move on to the next thing			0
i ’ve got 10 more where that came from , ' he said about his next possible project			0
@entity3 's next project may be a prison film , according to @entity197 , who reported that he has been researching details about actor @entity230 's acquittal for the murder of his wife @entity232 in 2001			0
the site also states that the prolific writer is still interested in making a film starring @entity185			0
plenty to do : the writer - director , shown behind the camera for @entity204 , said he has other projects in the pipeline			0

@entity4 say it published link to script ' because it was news '
