by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 27 march 2013 for some of even the most experienced drivers , parallel parking might not be the easiest manoeuvre			0
and the pressure of being watched by other drivers can make it even worse			0
but imagine having to pull of a high - speed parking move , using only the handbrake and the streeting wheel , to skid into a space with just five inches to spare - or 13.1cm - a gap shorter than the length of an average pencil			1
however , driven on by brotherly competition , @entity15 and @entity16 , from @entity17 , managed to do exactly that when they beat the tightest parallel parking world record			1
driving vintage @entity44 , each of the brothers attempted the stunt , watched on by the cameras and adjudicators			0
they had to skid the car into the space in one go , without touching either of the other vehicles or a white mark which outlined what would normally be the pavement			2
@entity16 , 31 , was the first to break the record			0
he told this is @entity58 : ' when i broke the world record i was in shock			1
' @entity15 , his elder brother by two years , then matched the feat , once again after a number of attempts			2
how close ? the car just about manages to squeeze into the gap success : the car appears to be perfectly in place judgement : the adjudicators have to assess whether all of the rules have been adhered to nervous wait : @entity16 waits with his hands over his mouth as the judges decide on whether the record has been broken new world record : the judges make their decision and @entity16 takes the record he said : ' when i achieved it , all i felt was relief			1
the light was fading and i only had one or two attempts left so the pressure was on			0
' the fact that we hold the world record together is great as we are very competitive with each other but @entity16 continually reminds me that he got it first			2
' their challenge was filmed in december for the new @entity94 show @entity95 which features some of the funniest , most ridiculous , scariest and amazing record attempts from around the world			0
brothers in arms : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) have both managed to break the world record brotherly competition : @entity15 makes another attempt to fit the car into the same spot another go : as the dark begins to settle , @entity15 looks as if he might have been successful this time what a fit : @entity15 also manages to skid the car into the space and share the record with his brother video : tight squeeze ! two brother break world record for tightest parallel park			1

@entity15 and @entity23 now share the world record
the pair had to speed up to the space and skid in with a handbrake turn
space was 13.1cm bigger than car , beating the previous record of 14cm
