by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 3 may 2013 this family of fluffy monkeys may look pretty bad - tempered , but appearances can be deceptive			2
@entity6 and @entity7 the @entity5 monkeys are actually pictured below celebrating the arrival of their son @entity9 , the second ever of their species to be born at @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity9 , who had white fur when he was born three months ago , is now slowly growing black fur to resemble his parents			1
when @entity9 the @entity5 monkey was born at @entity14 in @entity15 he had white fur look at me now : at three months old , baby @entity9 has started to develop the contrasting fur of his parents and while he will probably end up looking as miserable as they do , for now he looks rather happy with his new look			1
native to @entity26 , @entity5 monkeys are actually extremely sociable , despite the colouration of their fur giving them an unhappy look			2
with the arrival of the new sunnier weather , @entity9 has been enjoying bouncing around his enclosure with his sibling , @entity35 , and the rest of his family group			1
park curator @entity38 said : ' the group now has two playful infants to keep an eye on as they make the most of the warm spring weather			0
' all adults take a role in babysitting and luckily , @entity47 is a very patient dad			0
' the newest born was named after employee @entity48 , who has worked at @entity14 since 1997 and says @entity5 are his favourite species			1
@entity9 as a new - born @entity5 monkey clung to his mother , and had white fur which is all now turning black he is bigger now , but he still enjoys a cuddle from mum in his enclosure at @entity14 they live in family groups comprising one male , several females , and their offspring , and female @entity5 monkeys usually announce that they are ready to mate by tongue smacking			1
with females giving birth to a single offspring approximately every 20 months , @entity62 has got his work cut out for him			0
in the wild , males leave their birth groups before they are fully mature , either by choice or by force , and live alone or in small bachelor groups			0
some will eventually take over a harem of their own			0
each group has its own territory in the tree canopy that is well defined and defended			0
the word ' colobus ' is derived from the @entity80 ' kolobus ' , meaning ' mutilated one '			2
it refers to their thumb , which is little more than a short stub			0
the @entity5 monkeys are extremely sociable and live in large family groups comprising a male , the females he mates with , and their offspring you 're never too old for a cuddle : despite being the grand old age of three months , @entity9 like a hug with his mother the monkeys run on all fours along familiar routes through branches , and take turns sleeping at night so that one member of the troop is always awake and watching for predators			1
males defend their group and territory from others with roars , tongue - clicks , chases , and an unusual stiff - legged display .			0

colobus monkey @entity9 has shed white fur and is going dark like his parents
he is the second baby colobus born at @entity14 in @entity117
