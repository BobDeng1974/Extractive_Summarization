by @entity0 @entity2 and @entity3 striker @entity1 looks poised to join his boyhood club @entity4 , who released him as a 15 - year - old			1
we asked @entity0 of fan website @entity9 where he sees the @entity11 fitting in to @entity13 ' team and how likely the big man is to succeed			0
hardly a fortnight has passed since the season ended and @entity4 have been linked with nearly half of @entity2 's first team			0
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , even @entity20 's name has been thrown up			0
but when @entity1 became the first that the south coast side had received an official bid from @entity4 for it was a shock , to say the least			0
taking to @entity29 you could see the concern from many - was this another @entity31 in the making ? another @entity35 who 's ability has been incorrectly inflated by his nationality ? listening to some , it would seem so			2
but being a scouser at @entity4 means much more than being @entity35 ; it can often afford you more time to prove yourself and , as we 've seen in the case of @entity43 , that is no bad thing			1
it is for this reason ( although , not this reason alone ) that @entity1 's proposed move to @entity4 was greeted by most fans with a kind of whimsical positivity			1
goalscorer : @entity4 target @entity1 ( left ) celebrates scoring for @entity2 this season on target : @entity1 shows his delight in notching goals for bother @entity3 ( left ) and @entity2 ' good for him ! ' is the almost resounding sentiment , as it is rare that a local lad finally gets the opportunity to play for a club whose crest he has emblazoned on his shoulder at 32 , though it should be noted that this move is in no way sentimental by the club			1
sure , the fact that @entity1 ’s a @entity11 will almost certainly help , in that he 'll likely give that elusive ' extra 10 per cent ' but there is no doubting he is being brought in to do a very specific job			0
while @entity69 and @entity70 will undoubtedly still be the club 's main strike - force , @entity1 is being purchased for those games when all the skill and trickery in the world get you nowhere , for when you need a totally different approach			2
it may now be a dirty phrase in @entity35 football but @entity1 is a ' traditional centre forward ' and at times @entity4 lacked that last season			2
with the increase in games next season too it would be much more heartening to have an option like @entity1 from the bench than @entity89 or @entity90			1
working hard : @entity1 goes through his training drills for @entity3 ahead of this summer 's @entity92 in @entity93 other @entity2 targets : @entity4 are also keen on @entity2 's @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 not another @entity31 : the differences between @entity1 and @entity4 flop @entity31 's games look clear many may cry ' what was wrong with @entity31 ? ! ' but while their games are somewhat similar , the resounding difference is that @entity1 is an experienced , canny pro and - most importantly - scores goals : 28 in his last 2 @entity103 seasons , to be precise			1
can you really grumble at a 15 goal - a - season striker for £ 4 million ? oh , and did i mention he 's a scouser ? read more of @entity0 's opinions at @entity9 and on @entity29 @ @entity9			0

@entity1 's move to @entity4 has been received positively by the fans
being a @entity11 at @entity4 means much more than being @entity35 - it affords you more time to prove yourself
@entity1 is being brought in for those games when all the skill and trickery get you nowhere - when you need a more direct approach
the @entity2 striker is a much stronger option from the bench than @entity90 or @entity89
*comparisons* with @entity4 flop @entity31 are incorrect - @entity1 is an experienced , canny pro with a proven @entity103 scoring record
