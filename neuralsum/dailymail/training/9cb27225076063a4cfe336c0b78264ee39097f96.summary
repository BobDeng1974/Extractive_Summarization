@entity0 was arrested after telling police she had not been in contact with the media about the story a judge has been arrested over claims that she lied about her involvement in leaking information on @entity10 to the @entity11 , it was revealed yesterday			1
@entity0 , 55 , was questioned over allegations that she lied to police during the investigation into whether former cabinet minister @entity10 asked his then wife @entity15 to take his speeding points			1
miss @entity0 , a neighbour and friend of @entity15 , told police she had not been in contact with newspapers about the story			1
but emails revealed the barrister and part - time crown court judge was in contact with a freelance journalist , @entity26 , who was working for the @entity27			2
mr @entity26 told the newspaper that @entity32 was ‘ determined to go for the kill ’ against @entity10 , who was then @entity30 in the @entity31			0
in an email , the freelance journalist said @entity10 would be forced to resign over the speeding points allegations and suggested he and a news editor on the paper should take the judge out for a ‘ farewell to @entity10 drink ’			0
the revelation about @entity32 – one of @entity42 ’s most prominent black judges – came on the second day of the retrial of @entity10 ’s ex-wife for perverting the course of justice			0
the jury at @entity48 heard that @entity32 was dropped as a witness because doubt had been cast on her ability to act as a ‘ witness of truth ’			1
@entity54 , prosecuting , said @entity15 and @entity32 ‘ cooked up a plan ’ to leak the speeding points story to the @entity11 in 2010 in revenge after @entity10 left @entity15 for his pr adviser @entity58			1
miss @entity0 was a neighbour of the couple in @entity60 , south - west @entity61 , and became a close friend of @entity15 after the acrimonious break - up , as she had also been abandoned by her partner			1
she acted as @entity15 ’s intermediary with the @entity27 and arranged a meeting between @entity15 and a news editor in her legal chambers			2
the jury heard @entity10 , 58 , angrily denounced the judge as ‘ batty ’ as @entity15 tried to catch him on tape confessing to forcing her to take the points on her licence			2
the court heard @entity15 ( left ) , helped by @entity0 , told journalists about the story to get revenge on @entity10 ( right ) after he left her for pr adviser @entity58 in june 2010 mr @entity78 read a statement from detective inspector @entity80 from @entity81 , explaining why @entity32 was not called as a witness in the first @entity15 trial			1
he said : ‘ @entity32 has provided statements to the police in this case but during the investigation it became apparent that she may have lied about her involvement with the @entity11 , in that she denied having any contact with the @entity27 or any other media organisation in relation to this story			1
‘ @entity32 has been arrested and is currently under investigation by the police			1
miss @entity0 could therefore no longer be relied upon as a witness of truth			1
’ detective inspector @entity80 said mr @entity26 and his news editor @entity98 were not called as witnesses because they had declined to give statements			0
the court heard they were entitled to do so because ‘ journalistic material ’ was protected by law			0
there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the @entity27			0
@entity15 , 60 , said she told the newspaper that @entity10 had forced his constituency aide @entity108 to take the three points so he would not lose his driving licence			2
she now admits she took the penalty points herself in 2003 but denies perverting the course of justice as she claims she was forced to do so because of ‘ marital coercion ’			0
there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by @entity108			0
@entity10 is facing jail after he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice			0
he has resigned as mp for @entity120 and will be sentenced later			0
the jury in @entity15 ’s first trial was discharged after it failed to reach a verdict			2

@entity0 , 55 , was arrested for ' lying to police '
@entity131 hears she helped @entity15 to tell journalists about the story
@entity0 can ' no longer be relied upon as a witness of truth ' because of lies
she remains under investigation by the police
