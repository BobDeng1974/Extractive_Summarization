by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity3 's overheating housing market finally appears to be cooling - as figures revealed mortgage lending had stalled last month			1
some £ 16.5 billion - worth of home loans were handed out in may , matching the figure for the month before according to the @entity8 said			1
despite holding steady month - on - month , lending is still ' substantially ' higher than a year ago , with lending in may some 12 per cent higher than the year before			1
after months of increased lending , mortgage lending finally slowed down in may			2
the figures come amid growing evidence that the housing market is slowly starting to cool @entity8 chief @entity16 blamed the ' softening in the pace of recovery ' was linked to tougher mortgage rules which came into force at the end of april			1
he said the recent ' softening in the pace of recovery ' would appear to back up reports that demand in @entity24 , where the market has been at its most heated , is starting to cool			0
the new @entity27 rules mean lenders have to grill mortgage applicants more thoroughly about their spending habits , to make sure that their repayments will be affordable			2
chancellor @entity32 announced plans last week to hand the @entity34 powerful new tools which would give it the power to cap the size of mortgages based on people 's salaries or the value of the house			1
it comes after the business secretary @entity45 warned against a premature rise in interest rates			0
the @entity49 cabinet minister sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘ five times ’ their salary			2
an outspoken critic of @entity3 ’s banks , mr @entity45 questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘ sensible ’			0
chancellor @entity32 has introduced new rules for banks to check whether families can afford mortgage repayments , in a bid to avoid a fresh house price bubble he warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery			1
mr @entity45 said : ‘ there is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices , certainly in @entity24 and the @entity73 , potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole			0
‘ if , for example , interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy , then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening			0
’ his comments came as the @entity34 gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families			2
mr @entity45 said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker ’s salary ‘ must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers ’			0
mr @entity45 said the ‘ traditional ’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times ’ somebody ’s salary			0
the @entity103 this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in @entity24 over the last year			1
this is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began , and means the average @entity24 home now costs nearly £ 500,000			2
in mr @entity45 ’s constituency of @entity111 , the average person who lives in the leafy @entity24 borough and works full - time in the area earns £ 33,000			1
but the average house price is nearly £ 595,000 , according to the property website @entity117			0
if they want to buy a house , they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary			0
the @entity34 this week dropped hints that interest rates could rise sooner than expected , which would add to the costs of mortgage - holders , although any increase is expected to be gradual			0
average @entity3 house prices have hit a new peak of £ 260,000 after leaping by 9.9 per cent over the last year , according to figures released by the @entity103 this week			1
but in a sign of what is to come , property website @entity132 also reported this week that it is seeing evidence that house - sellers ’ asking prices are starting to come ' off the boil ' , with property values in some parts of @entity24 appearing to have hit the ceiling of what buyers will pay			0
@entity132 said the new @entity146 rules have already dampened housing market demand , with estate agents reporting that some lenders are initially applying the new rules in a ' knee jerk ' way , leading to house sales falling through			1
the @entity154 has also said that the recent sharp rises in some house prices and the stricter mortgage lending rules are starting to take some of the strongest heat out of the property market			1
speculation that further steps could be taken to cool the market has also been growing .			0

some £ 16.5 billion - worth of mortgages handed in may - the same as april
this is still £ 500 million a *day* - 12 per cent higher than same time last year
experts say @entity32 's new lending rules have *curtailed* housing boom
