a three - month - old baby boy was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother , an inquest heard			1
mother - of - four @entity5 brought the infant into her bed because she ' wanted to be with him ' , after separating from his father			1
she found three - month - old @entity9 unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene			1
three - month - old @entity9 was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother , an inquest in @entity16 heard the @entity16 hearing was told @entity9 was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz , but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns			1
miss @entity5 of @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity22 , told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am			2
the company team leader said : ' i would wake up about 12 and then 3am , he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed			0
' on october 19 last year @entity9 's father @entity30 , an insurance worker , took him out before returning before 1pm			1
the youngster slept until 2.45pm before waking for a feed and was a ' bit sick			0
' after that he was said to be fine			0
@entity9 had another feed at 6.30pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep			2
that evening miss @entity5 was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa			2
the inquest was told that @entity9 did have a @entity43 basket but miss @entity5 said : ' he did n't like sleeping in it , he had a crib in our room			1
' that night i put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib			0
i wanted to be with him			0
i was playing songs he liked listening to			0
' @entity9 , pictured with his father @entity30 , had been perfectly healthy before he died she said she lay on her back and put herself between @entity9 and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet			1
she woke at around 6am to find @entity9 unresponsive despite mouth - to - mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator , @entity9 was pronounced dead at the scene			1
when asked by the coroner @entity62 if she had been aware of any overlying miss @entity5 replied ' no. ' she said that when she woke @entity9 was in the same position in which she had left him			1
the @entity65 advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room			0
they advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker , has recently drunk alcohol , taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired			2
they say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight			1
the @entity65 say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their baby			0
or the child could get caught between the wall and the bed , or roll out of an adult bed and be injured			2
she also said that he had n't cried in the night			0
the pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child			1
recording a narrative cause of death mr @entity62 said : ' it 's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death			1
' although born prematurely @entity9 did grow and thrive and that 's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents			1
' he was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity			0
' he was placed in bed with @entity5 because she wanted to be close to him that day			2
' he usually slept in a crib , sadly he did n't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive			1
' it 's important that some of the factors that arise in @entity118 are given as a warning , there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death			2
' prematurity is one of the factors , co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking			0
i 'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house			0
it is not right to reach any conclusion that these factors caused the @entity118			0
i make no comment other than that they exist and people should be aware of this			0
