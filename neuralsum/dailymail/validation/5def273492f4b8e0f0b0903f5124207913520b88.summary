as we find more planetary systems elsewhere in the galaxy , something is confusing astronomers - why does our solar system appear so unique ? many other systems have ‘ super-earths ’ and other planets in tight orbits close to their star , but ours does not			1
and now we might know why - because @entity11 acted like a ‘ wrecking ball ’ in the early solar system and knocked planets out of the solar system or into position			1
@entity18 scientists have presented a new theory for the solar system			1
they say early in its life , @entity11 swung through the inner planets ( illustration of early solar system shown )			1
this explains why there are no planets between @entity29 and the sun. but it may also indicate our system is an ' oddball ' in the galaxy if this is true , it would suggest that the conditions that have allowed life on @entity39 to thrive are incredibly rare			1
the study published in @entity41 helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years			0
‘ now we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems , one of the most interesting features is the absence of planets inside the orbit of @entity29 , ’ said professor @entity44 , of @entity45 in @entity46 , who co-authored the study			1
‘ the standard issue planetary system in our galaxy seems to be a set of super-earths with alarmingly short orbital periods			0
our solar system is looking increasingly like an oddball			2
’ aliens are real - not little green men visiting @entity39 as depicted in movies , but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond			1
that ’s according to two leading @entity70 ( @entity70 ) researchers , who took part in a hearing at the @entity73 , @entity74 , and technology in @entity76 last august			0
during the talk dubbed ‘ @entity79 ’ in may , the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone			0
the speech was made by dr @entity84 , senior astronomer at the @entity86 in @entity87 , and dr @entity88 , director of seti research			0
and , they added , with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years			0
dr @entity88 said : ‘ it would be bizarre if we are alone , ’ he told the committee			0
‘ it would be a cramped mind that did n’t wonder what other life is out there			0
’ the new findings provide an explanation for this ‘ gaping hole ’ in our inner solar system between @entity29 and the sun. but they also reveal certain characteristics of @entity39 and the other rocky planets , which would have formed later than the outer ones from a depleted supply of material			1
namely , @entity11 may have helped @entity39 form in a habitable part of the solar system			1
and it also possibly played a part in @entity39 's size , ensuring it was not too big or small to host water and life			0
computer models of the early solar system showed the migration of @entity11 may have shepherded small early planets - initiating a ‘ collisional cascade ’ in the inner solar system			1
before this it ’s plausible that rocky planets with deep atmospheres would have been forming close to the sun from a dense disk of gas and dust on their way to becoming typical ‘ super-earths ’ like so many of the planets astronomers have found around other stars			0
as @entity11 moved inward , gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close - knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces			0
‘ it ’s the same thing we worry about if satellites were to be destroyed in low - earth orbit , ’ said professor @entity44			0
‘ their fragments would start smashing into other satellites and you ’d risk a chain reaction of collisions			0
‘ our work indicates that @entity11 would have created just such a collisional cascade in the inner solar system			2
’ as @entity11 ( pictured from the @entity166 on 8 october 2000 ) moved inward in the early solar system , gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close - knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces the study published in @entity41 helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years			1
notably , many other systems have super-earths ( illustration shown ) - but our solar system has none the resulting debris would then have spiraled into the sun under the influence of a strong ‘ headwind ’ from the dense gas still swirling around the sun. ‘ the ingoing avalanche would have destroyed any newly - formed super-earths by driving them into the sun , ’ said professor @entity44			2
a second generation of inner planets would have formed later from the depleted material that was left behind , consistent with evidence that our solar system ’s inner planets are younger than the outer planets			2
the resulting inner planets - @entity29 , @entity197 , @entity39 and @entity198 - are also less massive and have much thinner atmospheres than would otherwise be expected			2
‘ one of the predictions of our theory is that truly @entity39 - like planets - with solid surfaces and modest atmospheric pressures - are rare , ’ added professor @entity44			2
ultimately , @entity11 's interaction with the inner solar system billions of years ago may have given rise to the solar system we know today ( illustrated ) - and also the conditions necessary for life on @entity39 , namely a habitable distance from the sun and a suitably - sized world planet hunters have detected well over a thousand exoplanets orbiting stars in our galaxy , including nearly 500 systems with multiple planets			1
what has emerged from these observations as the ‘ typical ’ planetary system is one consisting of a few planets with masses several times larger than the @entity39 ’s - @entity229 - orbiting much closer to their host star than @entity29 is to the sun. in systems with giant planets similar to @entity11 , they also tend to be much closer to their host stars than the giant planets in our solar system			1
the rocky inner planets of our solar system , with relatively low masses and thin atmospheres , may turn out to be fairly anomalous			0
according to professor @entity44 , the formation of giant planets like @entity11 is somewhat rare , but when it occurs the giant planet usually migrates inward and ends up at an orbital distance similar to @entity39 ’s			2
only the formation of @entity249 in our own solar system pulled @entity11 back out and allowed @entity29 , @entity197 , @entity39 , and @entity198 to form			1
therefore , another prediction of the paper is that systems with giant planets at orbital periods of more than about 100 days would be unlikely to host multiple close - in planets .			0

@entity18 has present a new theory for solar system
they say early in its life , @entity11 swung through the inner planets
this explains why there are no planets between @entity29 and the sun
but it may also indicate our system is an ' oddball ' in the galaxy
and it may mean conditions for life on @entity39 were extremely rare
