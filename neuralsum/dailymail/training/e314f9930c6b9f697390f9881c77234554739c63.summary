half a million from abroad came to live here in the 12 months to the end of last september , the smallest number since 2001			0
but much of the drop came from a 22 per cent decrease in the number of foreign students			1
however , mr @entity3 said that because overseas students were counted as immigrants under international rules , their number was ‘ easily translated into a flood of immigrants ’			0
he added : ‘ when , last week , the number declines , this is a great triumph for immigration control , which is quite absurd and unfortunately is seriously distorting the debate on sensible university policy and , indeed , sensible immigration policy			2
‘ i just want to make absolutely clear , as far as the government is concerned we have no cap on the number of overseas students , we do n't propose to introduce one			0

@entity18 mayor @entity17 said a drop in foreign students to the @entity8 was not something to be celebrated ‘ in some of the @entity67 vernacular newspapers the message has gone out that the @entity8 no longer want @entity67 students , which is wrong but that 's the message that has gone out			1
