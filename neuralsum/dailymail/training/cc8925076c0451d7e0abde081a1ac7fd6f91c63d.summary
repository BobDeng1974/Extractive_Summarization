@entity1 ’s authority in @entity2 and on the world stage was dealt an unprecedented blow last night as he faced a breathtaking @entity6 defeat over plans for missile strikes on @entity9			1
in an extraordinary assault on the prime minister ’s authority , 50 coalition mps joined @entity14 in voting against a watered - down @entity16 motion supporting the ‘ principle ’ of military action			1
there were shouts of ‘ resign ’ from the @entity14 benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked @entity24			1
a @entity37 source said mr @entity1 had no intention of resigning , adding : ‘ his colleagues support him on most things , but on this issue they disagreed			1
’ education secretary @entity43 was said to have shouted at @entity45 rebels outside the chamber : ‘ you ’re a disgrace , you ’re a disgrace			1
’ chancellor @entity48 today raised concern that the @entity27 's place in the world would be undermined by the vote			1
he told @entity54 's today programme : ' i think there will be a national soul - searching about our role in the world and whether @entity27 wants to play a big part in upholding the international system , be that big open and trading nation that i 'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that			1
' i understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in @entity2 many members of the public have about @entity27 involvement in @entity9			1
' i hope this does n’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world ’s problems			0
' blast : people inspect the damage at a site hit by what activists say was a car bomb in @entity84 province , @entity9 conservatives @entity86 ( @entity87 ) @entity88 ( @entity89 ) @entity90 ( @entity91 ) @entity92 ( @entity93 & @entity94 ) @entity95 ( @entity96 ) @entity97 ( @entity98 ) @entity99 ( @entity100 ) @entity101 ( @entity102 & @entity103 ) @entity104 ( @entity105 ) @entity106 ( @entity107 ) @entity108 ( @entity109 & @entity110 ) @entity111 ( @entity112 ) @entity113 ( @entity114 ) @entity115 ( @entity116 ) @entity117 ( @entity118 ) @entity119 ( @entity120 ) @entity121 ( @entity122 ) @entity123 ( @entity124 ) @entity125 ( @entity126 ) @entity127 ( @entity128 ) @entity129 ( @entity130 ) @entity131 ( @entity132 ) @entity133 ( @entity134 & @entity135 ) sir @entity136 ( @entity137 ) sir @entity138 ( @entity139 & @entity140 ) @entity141 ( @entity142 ) @entity143 ( @entity144 ) @entity145 ( @entity146 ) @entity147 ( @entity148 & @entity149 ) @entity151 @entity150 ( @entity152 ) @entity154 @entity153 ( @entity155 ) @entity156 ( @entity157 ) @entity158 ( @entity159 ) @entity160 ( @entity161 ) @entity162 ( @entity163 ) @entity164 ( @entity165 ) @entity166 ( @entity167 ) @entity168 ( @entity169 ) @entity170 ( @entity171 and @entity172 ) mr @entity1 , who had made a passionate plea for support over proposals for targeted strikes on @entity177 after a chemical weapons attack last week , was forced to issue a humiliating climbdown			1
‘ it is clear to me the @entity27 @entity2 does not want to see @entity27 military action			1
i get that and the government will act accordingly , ’ he told @entity180			0
his decision to pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with the @entity188 in a planned attack on @entity9 , and to recall @entity2 from its summer recess for an emergency debate , backfired spectacularly			2
mr @entity1 had been counting on @entity14 ’s support to ensure he could win a @entity6 vote authorising strikes , despite the doubts of scores of @entity45 mps			1
@entity14 , however , refused to back the government , prompting the angriest foreign policy row between the main parties since @entity201 in 1956			2
the @entity45 accused @entity202 of giving ‘ succour ’ to president @entity204 ’s regime			2
defence secretary @entity206 said : ‘ i ’m disappointed with @entity202 ’s behaviour , frankly			0
anything that stops this from giving a clear , united view of the @entity27 @entity2 will give some succour to the regime			1
’ after the vote , mr @entity206 said : ‘ i hope @entity27 is n’t going to retreat into being the sort of nation that is n’t going to act to uphold international norms			2
’ sir @entity217 , a former defence minister who voted ‘ reluctantly ’ with the government , accused mr @entity1 of rushing into the vote			2
@entity220 , head of the @entity9 team at the @entity222 , tweeted simply : ‘ disaster			0
’ senior @entity188 officials said president @entity225 was prepared to move ahead with a limited military strike despite last night ’s vote			0
two @entity45 ministers , international development secretary @entity229 and @entity222 minister @entity230 , apparently missed the vote after not hearing a division bell			2
debate : a chastened mr @entity1 was forced by @entity14 leader @entity202 to pledge not to deploy any @entity27 military forces without first staging another @entity6 vote @entity237 landscape : free @entity239 fighters drive a military tank that belonged to forces loyal to @entity9 's president @entity204 after they seized it , in @entity243 's town of @entity244 an earlier @entity14 motion , demanding further conditions before @entity27 could be involved in any military action , was defeated by 332 votes to 220			1
in other developments : moment : mps last night dramatically voted against @entity1 's plea to take military action against @entity9 recall : mr @entity1 told a packed @entity24 that @entity27 had to decide how to respond to ' one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century ' demonstrate : protesters speaking out against military action in @entity9 stand outside the @entity260 last night ’s vote is a grave humiliation for mr @entity1 and will also raise doubts about the future of the ‘ special relationship ’ between @entity27 and the @entity188			1
one @entity267 source said @entity27 was ‘ handing back its deputy sheriff ’s badge ’ to @entity270			2
the shadow of @entity272 loomed large over yesterday ’s proceedings , with speaker after speaker referring to the mistakes and misinformation of the @entity278			0
the prime minister acknowledged that @entity283 had ‘ truly poisoned the well of public opinion ’ on military intervention			0
prudent : an @entity287 jet comes in to land at @entity288 in @entity289 yesterday as a ' prudent and precautionary measure ' , the @entity285 said @entity291 : @entity9 's president @entity204 ( centre left ) pictured yesterday during a meeting with a @entity296 delegation in @entity177 he admitted there was not ‘ one smoking piece of intelligence ’ but insisted it was ‘ beyond doubt ’ that @entity204 ’s regime was responsible for a chemical attack that killed at least 350 civilians			0
mr @entity202 insisted he was not ruling out backing military strikes at some point , but presented his own ‘ sequential roadmap ’ before he thought @entity27 should take such a step			0
asked if mr @entity202 was giving comfort to @entity204 , a @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ yes			0
the fact is that a lot of the arguments over this could give succour to the regime			0
’ no 10 also accused mr @entity202 of ‘ flipping and flopping ’ and having privately indicated his party would back military intervention before moving the goalposts at the last minute			0
making their point : protesters demonstrating against military action in @entity9 stand outside the @entity260 in @entity325 , central @entity326 placards : a protester demonstrating against military action in @entity9 outside the houses of @entity2 in @entity326 opposition : as @entity180 debated the @entity27 response to the @entity9 crisis , protestors gathered outside the @entity6 anger : anti-war protesters have staged a number of demonstrations in @entity325 this week @entity14 said the suggestion it was giving succour to @entity204 was ‘ frankly insulting ’			1
mr @entity1 acknowledged voters were sceptical about getting into ‘ another war in the @entity343 ’ but insisted he was not proposing a long - running campaign to dislodge @entity204 – rather a strike on ‘ command and control ’ assets to try to reduce the chances of another chemical weapons attack			1
a string of senior conservatives , however , expressed doubts about the wisdom of intervention and mr @entity1 ’s rush to join the @entity188			0
former @entity45 leadership contender @entity108 said : ‘ it ’s very simple – when you are going to do things which will lead to the death of people , civilians in particular , you should get your facts right first			0
’ campaign : @entity365 leader @entity364 ( left ) and his deputy @entity366 launched this poster opposing @entity27 intervention in @entity9 condemnation : mr @entity364 said @entity1 's policy on @entity9 was his ' gravest misjudgment yet ' lord @entity372 , former head of the @entity373 , said he did not support military intervention in @entity9 in any shape			1
he said : ‘ the drums of war were banging very loudly two or three days ago			0
the people did n’t like it			0
’ but dr @entity380 , former conservative defence secretary , said : ‘ @entity381 has never worked to further the cause of peace			0
it will not now and it will not in the future			0
’ lord @entity385 , the former @entity386 leader , said : ‘ we are in danger of allowing the @entity188 and @entity389 to act as the conscience of the world while the @entity27 stands on the sidelines wringing its hands			2

@entity396 's authority in @entity2 and on world stage dealt unprecedented blow
shouts of ' resign ' from @entity14 benches as 285 - 272 vote was announced
last time any pm was defeated over issue of war and peace was in 1782
@entity37 source says @entity1 has no intention of resigning
@entity43 *allegedly* shouted at @entity45 rebels outside chamber : ' you *'re* a disgrace '
@entity27 faces ' soul - searching ' about role in the world , says @entity48
