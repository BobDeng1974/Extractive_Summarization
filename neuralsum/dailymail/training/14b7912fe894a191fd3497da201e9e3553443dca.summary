by @entity0 published : 08:18 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 11:37 est , 7 march 2013 we 've seen the future , and it 's bright			0
so bright is it , in fact , that even eyelashes are powered by led lights and contact lenses glow in the dark			1
thanks to @entity11 's enlightening ( literally ) gadget page in @entity14 magazine , we have been made aware of online false contact lens companies selling uv lenses - some without pupils , others with checkerboard patterns or @entity21 signs printed on the neon irises - that shine brightly in colours including hot pink , green and yellow even when it 's pitch black			1
@entity39 ups the ante by adding patterns to their designs , so you can buy glowing uv contact lenses with checkerboard motifs or @entity21 symbols on the iris for £ 15.99			1
meanwhile across the web , a @entity50 - based artist and designer from @entity52 has launched the @entity54 and is currently developing a wearable contraption that makes eyes flicker with tiny lights			1
the uv contact lenses in their case , left , and the @entity61 website , right @entity62 began her art project to explore what she calls ' the fetish of @entity66 ' : why women all over the world want larger eyes			1
she said : ' @entity71 women tend to have stronger needs for bigger eyes as a standard of beauty , but relatively few of them are born with naturally big eyes			0
' those without big eyes can only look for alternative ways to make their eyes look prettier , i.e. , larger , by using a repertoire of skills such as putting on makeup and wearing jewelry			0
' sometimes , the desires for bigger eyes can become almost obsessive , and many women opt for plastic surgery in order to make their dream come true			0
' would you wear a contraption to make your eyelashes sparkle with led lights ? @entity54 is a product still in development that enables a woman 's eyes to become her main feature no matter how small they are			2
the product features an inclination sensor , made with mercury , that detects the movements of the pupil in the eyes and eyelids			2
@entity62 said : ' if you wear it and move your head , @entity54 will flicker following your movements			0
it is as simple to use as wearing false eyelashes and as easy to remove as taking off a piece of jewelry			2
