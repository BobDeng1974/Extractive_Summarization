@entity2 mass killer @entity1 wanted to capture and decapitate former @entity2 prime minister @entity3 during his shooting massacre on @entity5 , he said			1
@entity1 told his trial he planned to film the beheading and post the video on the internet - as well as kill all 600 people who were at the @entity12 's youth camp on july 22			1
but @entity3 had already left the area as the far - right fanatic began his shooting spree			1
arrogant : @entity1 ( left ) pictured entering court today , later said he wanted to behead @entity2 's former @entity17 ( right ) and post footage of it online brutal : @entity1 said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent @entity21 video game in preparation for the attacks the revelation came as @entity1 described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun skills by playing the violent @entity21 : @entity28 computer game			1
the mass killer even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a @entity2 island			1
details of @entity1 's fixation with computer gaming was revealed after he admitted taking a ' sabbatical ' for a year during which he also played the fantasy game @entity41			1
in a further insight to @entity1 's warped mind he revealed how he gave his hunting rifle , pistol and ' getaway ' vehicle names taken from @entity48			1
the @entity21 , such as the @entity50 game , have often been cited as violent games tragic : @entity1 also spent hours on the fantasy game @entity41 as he set himself up for the massacre fictional : @entity1 immersed himself in the @entity41 so much that prosecutors think he believed he was in a video game during the attack during cross examination at @entity58 the 33 - year - old continued to give evidence at a trial where he has admitted killing 77 people in @entity62 on july 22 , last year			1
@entity1 killed 8 people in the city 's government district after leaving a 950kg van bomb before driving to @entity5 island where he shot and killed 69 mainly young people attending a @entity12 summer camp			0
violent video games can alter the brain in just one week and make players more aggressive , researchers say			1
an @entity75 study found key areas in the brain suffer reduced activity and leave it physically altered			0
the findings fuelled the debate over the impact violent games have on regular players and links to anti-social behaviour			1
they also came as a @entity88 teacher said children as young as four were hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18 - rated computer games			1
she claimed youngsters were struggling to separate reality from their experiences in the virtual world and then copied the scenes at school			0
they were coming to lessons too tired to learn after staying up late playing computer games , and were often leading ' solitary lives '			1
@entity102 , a reception class teacher at @entity104 ’s @entity103 in @entity105 , @entity106 , outlined her concerns at the @entity109 conference earlier this month			0
she said pupils regularly discussed playing games such as the @entity21 , set in various war zones , and @entity113 – where players carry out robberies , muggings , killings , drug deals and beat prostitutes with baseball bats			1
on one occasion , she saw pupils throwing themselves from a play car in slow motion and pretending blood was spurting out of them			0
her warning came after news that 14 - year - old @entity128 killed his mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video games , films and tv storylines			1
@entity1 was asked about his interest in computer games and revealed that between the @entity137 and december 2007 he took a ' sabbatical ' from working and played computer games for around 16 hours a day			1
initially he concentrated on playing the ' @entity41 ' fantasy game online before turning to more violent forms of computer ' entertainment			1
' ' some people take a year off playing golf , ' he told the court			2
' i wanted to take a year off to play @entity148 is not violent at all			2
it 's a strategy game			2
' during that year i played perhaps 16 hours a day and played an entire year			1
i was just playing and sleeping ... it was a dream i had			2
' some people like to play golf , some like to sail , i played @entity41			1
it had nothing to do with 22/7			0
' however @entity1 then revealed he then turned to playing @entity21 and instead of socialising with any friends he had even spent last @entity159 on his computer			1
the game is described as a ' first person shooter video game ' and @entity1 admitted by using it he honed his gun and targeting skills			1
months later he would use those same ' skills ' to kill 69 innocent people on the island of @entity5			2
on the opening day of the trial prosecutors read the names of the dead on @entity5 and revealed the gunshot wounds they received			1
most of them had died after taking two or three shots - and sometimes more - directly to the head			2
@entity179 examined about the game @entity1 told the court : ' the game teaches about target acquisition and you have to practice within a specific time			2
it 's a war simulator that shows you how to shoot at people			0
it helps you acquire experience of sights and targeting			0
the game uses a ' holographic sight ' similar to the one that @entity1 attached to his hunting rifle when he stalked his victims on the island with unerring accuracy			2
in a chilling admission regarding the efficacy of the controversial computer game he added : ' you could give it your grandmother and she would be able to become a super marksman ! ' @entity1 also admitted visiting an @entity62 pistol club 25 time to hone his handgun shooting skills but said the game was a great help to him			1
' i used a similar holographic aiming device ( sight ) at @entity5 and the game is such a good war simulator is so good that it is used by armies @entity212			2
' @entity213 : @entity1 is to make the daily trip between @entity215 in @entity216 near @entity62 , and the courthouse in the @entity2 capital carnage : a man lies injured in the road amid wreckage from the @entity62 blast as emergency service personnel rush to help him a holographic weapon sight is a non-magnifying gun attachment allowing the user to look through a glass optical window and see his target image superimposed at a distance			0
the sight provides a red circle image with a red dot inside the ring identifying the target			0
the court had heard earlier that @entity1 had no military training having managed to ' dodge ' his @entity238 by claiming he was the sole carer for his ageing mother			0
@entity1 also told the court how he gave his weapons and ' getaway ' vehicle names from @entity48 - arguing that many soldiers around the world do the same thing			1
his hunting rifle was called ' @entity246 ' - which means the ' @entity247 ' - and he had etched the name onto the weapon			2
his 9mm glock pistol was similarly marked but took the name of ' mjolnir ' - which means ' @entity253			2
' finally , the @entity255 van he used to escape @entity62 after the bombing and drive to @entity5 was given the name ' @entity258			0
' this refers to the mythological eight legged horse said to belong to @entity261 - the major @entity262 who was also known as the ' @entity263			2
' @entity1 walks with a gun in hand among bodies on @entity5 ' etching the names onto weapons is not new , ' added @entity1			2
' in fact , it is a great @entity271 tradition and lots of soldiers do it			0
' later @entity1 told how his original plan had been to make three bombs and to target @entity277 offices , the @entity278 and the @entity12 's offices			0
however , he had difficulty making more than one bomb so changed his plans			0
@entity1 also claimed that he planned to capture former @entity2 prime minister @entity3 , 72 , on the island and behead her on camera			0
he took a digital camera with him , he said , along with a knife , bayonet and plastic handcuffs , but changed the plan after finding the camera did not have enough battery life			0
@entity1 also told the court he planned to kill far more than his 69 victims , as he was aware around 564 people were on the island			0
he hoped many more would have fled into the water and drowned			0
‘ my goal was to kill them all , ’ he said			0
@entity300 , a professor of social anthropology at the @entity302 , said such computer games could put @entity1 in a state of delusion			0
' when he went out on @entity5 , possibly at some level still believing he was still paying a computer game and shooting people in real life , ' he said away from the court proceedings			1
he added : ' he does not seem to be very successful at distinguishing between the virtual reality of @entity41 and other computer games and reality			1
' @entity1 's trial , set to last 10 weeks , turns on the question of his sanity and thus whether he can be jailed			2
he has said that an insanity ruling would be ' worse than death '			0
although @entity1 has pleaded not guilty , he admitted the killings , saying his victims were traitors who supported immigration and multiculturalism , threatening @entity2 ethnic purity			0
one court - appointed team of psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic , while a second team found him to be of sound mind			0
yesterday he said he should either be executed or acquitted , calling the prospect of a prison sentence ' pathetic '			0
@entity1 has insisted he is a commander in a resistance movement but has acknowledged some of his claims were an exaggeration			0
he spent much of yesterday defending the claim that it existed at all			0
in court , @entity1 struggled to defend his claim of being ordained into a militant - nationalist group called the @entity339 in @entity340 in 2002 after preliminary contact in 2001 , refusing to answer more than 100 questions on the topic			0
today , the fourth day of the trial , saw @entity1 enter the @entity62 district court without the clenched - fist salute he had used in previous hearings			1
he was reportedly asked to stop the action by the panel of five judges .			1

played violent video game @entity353 hours each day

said it helped prepare him for brutal slaughter of 77 in july 2011
