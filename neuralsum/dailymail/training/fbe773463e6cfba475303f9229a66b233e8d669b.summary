by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:06 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 03:30 est , 26 june 2012 emergency treatment : health secretary @entity3 has drafted in a crisis team to deal with problems at @entity6 a hospital trust that has run up debts of £ 1million a week today becomes the first to be put into special measures			1
health secretary @entity3 will send in a crisis team of doctors , administrators and accountants to take control of @entity15			1
it has gone £ 150million into the red over the past three years , largely because of crippling @entity19 deals agreed by the last @entity21 government			1
its three hospitals will cost £ 2.5billion under the long - term construction and management scheme			1
the financial chaos has already hit patient care at the hospitals – @entity28 ’s in @entity29 , @entity30 in @entity31 and the @entity32 in @entity33			0
while services have improved in recent months , patients still face some of the longest waits for operations in the country			0
one in six patients waited longer than the 18 - week government target – the worst figure for any @entity43 trust in @entity44			2
it also performs poorly on casualty unit waiting times , ranking 20th out of 23 trusts in the capital			0
some departments and wards face closure			1
the @entity6 took on a large debt when it was formed - mainly from the @entity19 that had been used for building at the princess royal and @entity30 hospitals			1
mr @entity3 has activated an ‘ unsustainable providers regime ’ , putting the trust under the control of a special administrator with powers to demand rapid changes			1
the health secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of £ 30 - £ 75million a year for the next five years			1
@entity65 , @entity29 : the trust has gone £ 150million into the red over the past three years , largely because of crippling @entity19 deals agreed by the last @entity21 government in his letter to the trust , he wrote : ‘ @entity15 faces deep and longstanding challenges , some of which are not of its own making			1
' nonetheless , there must be a point when these problems , however they have arisen , are tackled ' i appreciate that any decision to use these powers will be unsettling for staff , but i want to stress that the powers are being considered now so that patients in @entity44 have hospital services that have a sustainable future			0
this will benefit patients and bring more certainty to staff , the public and other local stakeholders			0
' i am determined to improve healthcare services for patients in @entity44 and will take whatever difficult steps are necessary to achieve this			0
' a @entity97 source said mr @entity3 was not prepared to run the risk of a repeat of the @entity101 scandal in which poor quality care and mismanagement led to the needless deaths of hundreds of patients			2
@entity106 , chairman of the @entity107 , told @entity109 's today programme that there was clearly a need for change in the face of such enormous losses			0
@entity115 , @entity31 : @entity15 's three hospitals will cost £ 2.5billion under the long - term construction and management scheme he said there was an ' over-dependence on hospitals ' and that one focus of the restructuring may be improving ' care in the community '			1
the move means that , unlike loss - making companies in the private sector , the @entity6 will not have to pay back the money it has lost			0
mr @entity106 added : ' politicians are responsible but the secretary of state ca n't make all the decisions			0
there is a need for change			0
' an administrator could now be brought in and the @entity6 could go bust , leading to it being dissolved and some services closed			1
the @entity97 said in a statement : ' the hospitals in this @entity6 have faced multiple problems for many years , which the previous @entity143 made worse by a merger , and the approval of two huge @entity19 deals that have further destabilised the @entity6			1
the trust lost over £ 1 million a week last year , enough to pay for 1000 cataract operations per week , 200 hip replacements per week , or pay the salaries of 1200 nurses			2
' the unsustainable providers regime was created by @entity21 ’s @entity153 when he was health secretary			2
however , @entity21 never made use of them , preferring instead to sweep the problems facing some parts of the @entity43 under the carpet			2
@entity32 , @entity33 : one in six patients waited longer than the 18 - week @entity143 target - the worst figure for any @entity43 trust in @entity44 ' @entity15 is an exceptional case , showing most of the problems which are characteristic of “ challenged ” @entity164			1
there are about two dozen sucg trusts where the government inherited serious longstanding problems			0
' @entity3 ’s decision will send a strong signal to unsustainable @entity43 organisations that they can not continue to provide poor services or rely on bailouts from other parts of the @entity43			0
' all the hospitals deemed to be unsustainable have signed agreements with the @entity97 to turn their performance around , and it is possible that the government will consider putting some of them or others who can not deliver sustainable services into special measures if their leadership does not make progress fast enough			1
' @entity15 has previously owned up to multiple challenges including not being efficient enough , delivering low quality services , having poor contracting arrangements and having a weak board			2
like the many other hospitals yet to become part of the elite @entity191 , the @entity6 faces problems which – according to the @entity194 - " have lain unresolved for a number of years "			2
' @entity196 , chief executive of health think tank the @entity198 , warned on @entity109 's today programme that not only other @entity164 , but potentially even @entity191 at the very top , could go through the same thing			0
he said it was important to face up to the problems , and that administrators would be able to restructure .			0

@entity15 has gone £ 150million in the red over the past three years
many of the debts run up thanks to @entity19 deals agreed by @entity21 that will cost £ 2.5billion in the long term
departments and wards set to be closed in restructuring
trust is first to be put into special measures and faces being dissolved
