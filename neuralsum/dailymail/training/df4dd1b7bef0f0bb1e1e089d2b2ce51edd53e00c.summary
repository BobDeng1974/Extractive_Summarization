by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 5 september 2013 fatal : toxins from lead can put women in danger of pre-eclampsia with their sash windows , open fires and wooden floors , period properties are popular first family homes			1
but renovating an old house while pregnant could put mothers - to - be and their unborn children at risk , experts have warned			2
they say @entity16 on such properties can release lead from old paintwork , a poison that can raise blood pressure , putting women at risk of pre-eclampsia , a pregnancy complication that can be fatal to both mother and child			1
researchers also found that open fires can pose a serious risk , as burning coal releases lead particles into the air			1
passed from mother to baby in the womb , the toxin can also stunt intelligence and may make children hyperactive			1
it is thought that even relatively small amounts can be dangerous			0
the @entity43 study also flagged up alcohol , coffee and even pet dogs as potential sources of lead in pregnancy			1
dr @entity50 , an expert in the effect of various metals on children ’s growth and development , looked at lead readings in blood samples taken from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the @entity60 area			2
readings were higher than those found in similar groups in other developed countries – and were particularly high in women who were educated to degree level			0
this was unexpected as it is normally thought that exposure to environmental toxins is higher in poorer populations			0
the researchers are not sure why better - educated women are at greater risk , but speculate it is because they are more likely to buy older homes and renovate them			1
although lead is now banned in paint , it can still be released from woodwork that is being stripped of its original paintwork			0
potential sources include cornices and skirting boards , as well as floorboards that are being stripped down to create fashionable bare - look flooring			1
danger : @entity16 can release lead from old paintwork , researchers warned writing in the journal @entity93 , dr @entity50 said : ‘ a possible explanation is that women with higher educational attainment lived on older housing stock rather than on modern estates and were perhaps involved in the renovation of older properties ; this might cause exposure to lead - based paints , through sanding old woodwork , and to large amounts of dust that has accumulated over many decades			1
’ however , the factor she found to be most strongly linked with lead levels in a pregnant woman ’s blood was having a coal fire at home			2
coal contains lead which is released in smoke			2
dr @entity50 did not find any evidence that wood - burning stoves , which are becoming increasingly popular , cause a similar problem			0
however , alcohol , coffee and smoking were all linked to higher levels of lead while eating foods rich in iron and calcium was associated with lower readings			1
surprisingly , the study found that women who had a pet dog also tended to have higher amounts of lead in their blood			1
the effect was small but could be caused by the pets bringing contaminated soil and dust inside			0
the study is the largest of its kind ever done in the @entity137			0
the samples were taken in the early 1990s as part of a long - running health project			0
the use of lead has fallen since then , but with even small amounts of the metal believed to be dangerous , dr @entity50 believes it is important that pregnant women are aware of the risk			2
she said that they should not be alarmed but follow the general advice for a healthy pregnancy , including stopping or reducing alcohol and coffee intake and quitting smoking			0
the researcher added : ‘ if you have a house that was built before 1960 and you are scraping away original paint , you might want to think twice about that			0

lead poisoning puts women at risk of pre-eclampsia - fatal to mother and child
@entity43 study *highlights* pet dogs , alcohol and coffee as potential lead sources
burning coal *identified* as particular risk to baby in womb
