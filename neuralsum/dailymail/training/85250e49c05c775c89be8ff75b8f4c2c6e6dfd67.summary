by @entity0 from huge herds of zebras to colossal colonies of penguins , safety it seems , really does comes in numbers			2
and these creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space with often millions travelling together across difficult terrain			2
such mass migrations create some of the world 's greatest wildlife spectacles revealing the stunning patterns and behaviours of the natural world			1
pictured is a mass colony of king penguins seen in @entity31 often creatures huddle together as a way of keeping themselves safe from predators while they trek thousands of miles in their pursuit for food and shelter			1
amazingly , this type of behaviour is n't specific to a few types of animals and can be seen across the entire wildlife spectrum , including birds , mammals , fish , reptiles , amphibians , insects and crustaceans			1
but the reason for these epic congregations can vary , with some animals following weather patterns to sustain their supply of food and water while others migrate to return to familiar breeding grounds			1
a spectacular mass migration sight is that of flamingos in @entity64 flying in massive v formations when heading for their preferred breeding area in @entity67			1
huge quantities of female red crabs are pictured after spawning on @entity70			2
larger males arrive at the sea about 5 - 7 days before they female , but are soon outnumbered blue and yellow snapper fish are seen in moving vast schools along the reef , @entity76			0
these creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space one of the most impressive mass migrations is that of the zebra			1
earlier this year , a population of zebras surprised scientists by making a more than 300 mile ( 482km ) journey across @entity89 and @entity90 often seen during mass migration , these enormous animal groupings can be found in countries all over the world and prove an effective method of keeping themselves safe from predators			1
pictured is a huge group of great @entity101 horseshoe bats nesting in @entity101 the longest insect migration is the monarch butterfly			0
it travels up to 4,750km			0
the rarest migrant is the @entity107 albatross			0
there are only 70 - 80 adults in the world			0
the longest recorded journey in water is a leatherback turtle , which travelled 20,558km in 647 days			0
source : @entity115 as many as 2.5 million pink - feathered birds take to the skies for the journey as their breeding season arrives			0
humpback whales , for instance , travel further than any other mammal migrants , making a journey of up to 5,300 miles ( 8,500km ) each way			1
they are found in all of the world 's oceans , with most populations following a regular migration route from polar waters for feeding and tropical waters for mating			0
the most dramatic migrations are often seen in the @entity134 , an area located in north @entity67 and extending to south - western @entity135			1
around 750,000 zebras and 1.2 million wildebeests travel from the @entity139 area in southern @entity67 to the @entity140 in lower @entity135 following weather patterns			1
a huge school of salmon seen in the waters of @entity145			0
typically salmon are born in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce a huge colony of @entity151 on @entity152 in the @entity153			0
males and females form separate walrus herds during the non-breeding season the reason for these epic congregations can vary , with some animals following weather patterns to sustain their supply of food and water whilst others migrate to return to familiar breeding grounds			2
pictured is a mass of honeybees a spectacular mass migration sight is that of flamingos in @entity64 when heading for their preferred breeding area in @entity67			1
as many as 2.5 million pink - feathered birds take to the skies for the journey as their breeding season arrives a large group of red - bellied piranha underwater in @entity178			0
during attacks on prey , large , hungry shoals can strip flesh from the bones of large animals in minutes thousands of @entity185 butterflies rest on a tree in @entity187			1
scientists believe these insects have an internal magnetic compass to help them navigate the world a huge herd of of hippopotamus crowd into a pool at the end of the dry season in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity64			0
often groups of over 60 can be seen in one spot but one of the most impressive mass migrations is that of the zebra			2
earlier this year , a population of zebras surprised scientists by making a more than 300 mile ( 482km ) journey across @entity89 and @entity90			0
this is the longest big - mammal migration ever documented in @entity64 and is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing , land occupation and other human pressures			2
' it goes to show us that nature still has some surprises , ' said @entity221 , senior conservation scientist at the @entity223 - based @entity222 that led the two - year study on the migration			0
the most dramatic migrations are often seen in the @entity134 , an area located in north @entity67 and extending to south - western @entity135			1
. shown here are hundreds of wildebeest crossing a river during migration in @entity140 , @entity135 a huge group of grey reef sharks , congregating in @entity233 in @entity234			1
many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef , to which they continually return a huge herd of @entity241 kicking up dust in @entity90			1
the core of the herds is made up of related females , and their offspring			0
the basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males , high - ranking males and females and old or invalid animals tightly packed knots seen in @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255			2
they have one of the longest migrations of any animal travelling from their @entity261 breeding grounds to the coasts of @entity264 , @entity64 and @entity265 an enormous group of long beaked common dolphin hunt fish off the coast of @entity269			2
some dolphins will migrate due to seasonal changes , but they usually do nâ€™t travel as far as other whale species			0

often animals huddle as a way of keeping themselves safe from predators while they trek thousands of miles
