a farm dog has given new meaning to being @entity2 - by ploughing his owner 's potato field on his hind legs			1
lemon the @entity7 's talents were spotted by his owner , a former military dog trainer in @entity12 's @entity11 region , when he was just ten months old			1
since then 48 - year - old @entity13 has taught his pet to deliver logs , pump water from a tap , carry buckets of water and collect harvested crops			1
he has been using @entity31 as an unusual farm hand for more than a year and the pet has now become a minor celebrity in his home village of @entity45			2
it began , he said , when he was chopping firewood and his pet began delivering logs to his feet			2
he started training @entity31 to carry buckets of water and then moved on to more unusual tricks			1
the idea of a canine farm hand is not completely alien , since @entity7 - which stand at around 2ft tall when fully - grown - were used hundreds of years ago as working dogs			2
the breed was developed in @entity57 in the 17th century and the animals are known for their powerful bodies and thick coats , which protect them from the elements			0
i 'll drive : lemon at the controls of his owner 's snowmobile			2
thankfully the engine was switched off at the time no help needed : @entity31 carries a piece of wood ( left ) and even his own lead before going for a walk i 've got this sorted : the @entity7 dragging a bag of crops across the snow - covered forest floor despite @entity31 receiving the occasional treat , mr @entity13 said helping out was usually enough of a reward			1
' we noticed how willing he was to help when he was only ten months old , ' he said			0
' he picked up a log and brought it to me when i was chopping fire wood , then it was a bucket when i went for water			2
' his favourite occupation is carrying buckets of water			0
of course it is a big help to us - after a few trips he manages to bring an extra 25 litres			0
' i do treat him with something tasty from time to time but he mostly does it because he simply likes to be helpful			1
' he likes to try and do almost everything i do			0
i think if he had hands he would do everything for me			0
' unfortunately , his abilities are a little bit limited but we love his eagerness nonetheless			0
' companion : @entity31 was taught by his owner , former @entity12 military dog trainer @entity13 , 48 a dog 's life : it 's not all work and no play for the pet , who has plenty of time off to relax around his owner 's farm walkies ... the easy way : lemon on the back of his owner 's snowmobile in the remote @entity12 wilderness wildlife : @entity31 chewing the fat with a local horse			1
