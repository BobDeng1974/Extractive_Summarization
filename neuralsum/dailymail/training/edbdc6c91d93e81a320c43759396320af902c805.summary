@entity0 is the blueprint for boxers intent on becoming a world champion			1
but @entity4 will soon be the one signposting the path to superstardom , starting with a command performance against @entity8 in @entity9 on saturday			1
so says @entity4 ’s trainer			1
@entity4 prepares for his bout with @entity8 in @entity12 the @entity14 boxer undergoes some stretches during a workout session @entity4 underwent an open workout session at the @entity18 ahead of saturday night 's big fight @entity4 is greeted by @entity20 as he arrives at the @entity18 for his workout @entity4 stands in front of a billboard for his fight against @entity8 in @entity9 @entity4 takes part in a jump rope and shadow boxing session as he finishes preparation for saturday 's fight @entity30 believes welterweight @entity4 is on the brink of superseding @entity0 , explaining : ‘ @entity4 is one of our elite boxers			1
he has just two more levels to ascend			0
‘ the first is to prove that he is on the way to greatness			0
i expect him to do that against @entity8			1
‘ the second is to establish himself as truly great			0
’ the unspoken conclusion to the equation is that @entity4 can take that final step by becoming the man who puts an end to @entity0 ’s unbeaten record			1
yet even if that fight still fails to materialise , @entity30 expects @entity4 to become the planet 's no 1 fighting man			1
@entity4 takes a well - deserved breather during the grueling training session on wednesday @entity4 listens to trainer @entity30 during his training session on the running track to begin validating that lofty prediction , he rationalises the three defeats in @entity4 ’s career as simply unfortunate , saying : ‘ no - one beats @entity4			1
they just get a little lucky			0
’ here ’s how : on @entity60 , @entity30 said : ' @entity4 should never have been thrown into that fight			1
he was a boy against a man and ran onto a big punch			0
' on @entity64 , @entity30 insisted : ' that was a fight with it ’s own issues ( including the question of drugs )			2
even after that odd deduction of two points he should have been given the decision			0
' and on @entity74 , @entity30 explained : ' @entity4 was giving him a shellacking until he got careless and was caught by one huge shot			1
’ so what about that much derided @entity4 chin ? ‘ the problem when he went down was that his positioning was all over the place and he was too carried away with throwing big punches of his own			1
’ @entity4 was pictured deep in discussion with his trainer ahead of saturday 's important showdown @entity4 is aided by his brother @entity86 shortly after completing a training session on the track in @entity9 @entity4 should have fought @entity8 a year ago , before the @entity89 lost his world title which has ended up in the possession of another @entity92 , @entity4 ’s would - be rival @entity93			1
‘ yet @entity30 welcomes the year of ring inactivity during @entity4 ’s vain wait for a @entity0 fight			1
he says : ‘ i do n’t believe in ring rustiness as long as the boxer keeps working in the gym			0
in fact the delay has given us a chance to reconstruct @entity4 the way he should have been built in the first place			2
’ @entity30 has gone through a similar period with his first outstanding prodigy , @entity109 , who was rated the third best pound - for - pound fighter in the world before injury and a legal dispute rendered him fight - idle			0
@entity30 expects @entity109 to return to world title action soon , even greater			0
‘ if you are going to be the dominant fighter in your division , ’ says @entity30 , ‘ you should win fights which everyone expects to be difficult – easily			0
‘ @entity109 did that before and will do so again			0
@entity4 will do it against @entity8			1
both he and @entity109 have their best years ahead of them			0
@entity4 is already a man to be reckoned with			2
@entity4 is confident of beating @entity8 and hopes to take on unbeaten @entity0 next year @entity4 also trained in the ring at the @entity126 gym in preparation for the clash with @entity8 the 28 - year - old appeared in good spirits throughout the routine ahead of his fight at the @entity18 ‘ he has all the physical attributes for greatness			1
now , at 28 , married and with his first child he has gained in maturity			0
the mentality for greatness is coming			0
‘ @entity0 has proved that to be recognised as the best and to be the highest earner you do n’t have to go out to entertain the fans			2
’ and to those back in @entity144 who will raise eyebrows at this lavish praise for @entity4 , @entity30 draws upon a football analogy : ‘ in soccer you do n’t have to be the one who kicks the ball hardest and furthest			2
people admire the player with the most skill , the one who does things with the ball that others can not			0
‘ in boxing , that person now is @entity0			1
soon it can be @entity4			2
' as the burden of expectation builds on @entity4 ’s shoulders , so the bar keeps being raised			2
@entity30 expects him to hurdle that barrier , in style , saying : ‘ @entity4 has found his own identity now			2
he has established clearly in is mind who he wants to be			0
’ * @entity171 will be televised live on @entity172 late this saturday night			0

@entity4 takes on @entity8 at the @entity18 on saturday
the welterweight hopes to fight unbeaten @entity0 next year
