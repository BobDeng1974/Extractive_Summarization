care : a study has found a third more heart attack patients died a month later in @entity2 than @entity3 more than 11,000 deaths of heart attack patients could have been avoided if @entity2 care was as good as @entity3 's , a study has claimed			1
a third more @entity2 than @entity3 died within a month of having a heart attack , according to the research on half a million patients			1
scientists from @entity13 examined death rates in the two countries between 2004 and 2010			1
they said a key reason for the striking difference between the two was that @entity2 patients are not receiving the best possible treatment			2
professor @entity21 , from @entity13 , said : ' our findings are a cause for concern			1
' the uptake and use of new technologies and effective treatments recommended in guidelines has been far quicker in @entity3			0
this has contributed to large differences in the management and outcomes of patients			0
' in total , the team analysed records relating to 391,077 patients from 242 hospitals in the @entity2 and 119,786 from 86 hospitals in @entity3			2
they found that 30 days after a heart attack , 10.5 per cent of patients discharged from hospital were dead in the @entity2 compared with 7.6 per cent in @entity3			1
at the start of the study the difference was even more stark , with almost 50 per cent more patients dying in the @entity2 than in @entity3			2
but by 2010 , the gap had narrowed to 20 per cent			0
taking into account age and sex differences , heart attack severity , risk factors including rates of smoking and diabetes , and other influences , the scientists estimated that over the study period 11,263 @entity2 lives could have been saved by matching @entity3 standards			1
co-author dr @entity63 , from the @entity64 in @entity3 , said : ' our findings suggest that failure to get the best treatment is one likely reason why short - term survival for heart attack patients is lower in the @entity2			2
' concerning : the study , which looked at half a million patient records , said surgery and drugs like beta blockers were offered earlier and more often @entity3 than in @entity2 , and processes must be improved the study found drugs such as beta blockers were less likely to be prescribed to @entity2 patients and surgery on constructed coronary arteries were used earlier and more often in @entity3 - 59 per cent of the time compared with 22 per cent in the @entity2			1
the research was published in the medical journal @entity85			0
dr @entity86 , associate medical director at the @entity87 , said : ' the reasons behind the differing survival rates are complex , but one explanation could be the speed with which the two countries adopted primary angioplasty as an emergency treatment			0
' @entity3 's early adoption meant they saw the benefits quicker and this is reflected in the figures			0
however , the @entity2 has caught up and last year the majority of patients received this treatment			0
' the lesson here for the @entity2 is that we need to be led by the research and introduce pioneering practices quickly and on a large scale			0

study compared death rates in the two countries from 2004 to 2010
a third more @entity2 patients died than in @entity3 within a month of attack
research by @entity13 said *brits* received *inferior* care
