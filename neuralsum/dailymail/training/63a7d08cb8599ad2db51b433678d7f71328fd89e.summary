by @entity0 an extreme sports fan decided to propose to his girlfriend mid-way through a parachute jump but ended up fumbling the ring while she watched in horror as it tumbled uncontrollably to earth			1
@entity8 and his girlfriend @entity9 used a special type of tandem jump where they face each other as they leaped from the aircraft while12 , 500ft above @entity15			1
@entity9 wrapped her legs around the firefighter 's waist and strapped herself to his harness before exiting the plane			1
as he was about to hand over the ring , it ' slipped ' from his grasp and plunged to earth			1
@entity8 filmed the jump from a special helmet mounted camera and caught his girlfriend 's reaction as she saw the ring float for a second in mid air before tumbling out of control			1
before the jump , mr @entity8 arranged with members of the two families to hide around the landing zone with the genuine ring			1
he said : ' the original plan was to do it out of a hot air balloon			0
i had a bunch of friends helping with the coordination and helping to keep @entity9 from knowing what was going on			1
' we actually had planned it as a going away jump for a friend that was heading to @entity69 - it was the perfect cover , @entity9 had no idea			1
' the balloon jump got canceled multiple times due to weather so i was fed up			1
i was n't gon na let another weather hold keep me from asking her to marry me			2
' he said : ' so , two months after the original planned balloon jump , we had a " birthday boogie " for @entity9 's birthday at @entity82			1
' our plan was to jump the whole weekend and camp down there			2
so i decided this would be the perfect time to make this happen			0
' maybe even a good birthday present			0
so we came up with the mr. @entity90 plan			0
' i got a fake ring , knowing that i was going to drop it on our mr. @entity90 high pull at 12,500ft			2
then i called all her family and coordinated - with the help of her brother - in - law and my brother - them to come down on the day i was going to propose			0
' we even had a special staging area in one of the classrooms that my brother would escort them to so @entity9 would n't see any of her family there and get suspicious			2
' then , once we got on the plane that was taking us up for our proposal jump , my brother had all of her family and my family come out and wait for us to land			2
' she was super surprised and could n't believe all her family was there			0
in the end , it ended up being a great thing that the balloon jumps were canceled because it gave us a chance to have all of our family there to celebrate with us for this epic day			0
' once safely on the ground , @entity8 produces the real engagement ring as he bends down on one knee luckily this time there was no mistake as @entity9 agrees to marry @entity8 despite the high altitude prank @entity8 holds his wife after the second proposal in the same position they completed their 12,500ft parachute jump the couple now have 224 skydives each under their belts , although they almost failed to get together in the first place			1
friends insisted that the pair were a perfect match , but they resisted all attempts to be set up on a blind date			0
@entity8 added : ' neither of us wanted to be set up on a blind date , so when we first met at a country bar just by chance , i think we both wanted to make sure that it was clear we were not interested in what our friends were trying to force us into			2
' but , as it turns out , we were both attracted to each other but did n't want to admit it yet			0
it did n't take too long after for us to start " running into each other " more often			0
' our first unofficial first date was snowboarding up at @entity153 - a local mountain in @entity155			0
' we were just going " as friends " , so it was by no means a " real " date , but we both knew what it was			0
not too long after , we started officially dating			0
' after dropping the ring , @entity8 unfurled a banner asking @entity9 to marry him as they continued their descent once on the ground , @entity8 and @entity9 showed off the banner containing the proposal the fun - loving couple have both completed 224 parachute jumps in the 18 months they have been going out			1

@entity8 waited two months for the right weather to propose
@entity174 through the tandem jump he produced the engagement ring
girlfriend @entity9 immediately accepted the proposal
she looked on in horror as the ring tumbled away towards the earth
luckily , the ' fumble ' was part of an *elaborate* prank played by @entity8
