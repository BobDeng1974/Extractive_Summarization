female genital mutilation will be featured on @entity2 's casualty this weekend - the first time a mainstream broadcaster has tackled the subject in a drama series			1
the programme to be aired on saturday night is the second part of a storyline that follows a young girl called @entity10 who injures herself deliberately to avoid being sent abroad for the procedure			2
not only is the practice of female genital mutilation illegal in the @entity14 , but it is also illegal to assist in the procedure being done overseas			1
according to @entity19 statistics there are more than 20,000 girls at risk under the age of 15 and another 66,000 women in the @entity14 are living with the consequences			1
in teenager @entity10 's case , as with many other girls that undergo the procedure , she is due to be sent abroad			1
aware of what is about to happen to her , she tries to injure herself then confides in a nurse who suggests she fakes having a severe headache in order to miss the flight			0
at the end of the last episode of @entity31 viewers learned that @entity10 went missing from hospital			1
in the next part of the storyline she tries to stop an unqualified doctor from operating on her sister and three other young girls			0
she helps drive his car off the road , leaving him facing impotence , but what happens to the girls is even worse			0
they are operated on by family members and one is left on the verge of death			0
the programme did cause some concern , with a commenter on @entity80 posting : ' would you explain this to a 10 year old ? ' we were watching the episode and she asked " what just happened " but i did n't want to explain at that moment just before going to bed			0
not sure whether to tell her tomorrow or let it lie until she asks again when she 's older			0
' @entity10 hurt herself to go to hospital in order to miss a flight for a ' holiday ' in which she would have undergone the procedure but another added : ' there are ways of talking to a young child about @entity102 without going into graphic detail and questions like that should be answered as otherwise the child is going to think that it ca n't be talked about - which is far from the truth			2
' and the sad truth is that the reason @entity102 's still practiced in @entity14 and that @entity14 girls are still being taken abroad to be cut ( both illegal under @entity14 law ) is that not enough people know about the practice , and quite often those who do and are in a position to prevent it happening or intervene in some way are too worried about accusations of racism or cultural insensitivity - or just too embarrassed to talk about a girl 's genitals			1
' @entity124 , project manager of @entity125 said : ' we are delighted with the finished work , it is handled sensitively without avoiding any of the issues or demonising a particular community group			0
' we are hugely grateful to " casualty " for having the courage to take on this issue which many people do n't want to talk about for fear of offending relatives and communities			2
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' casualty has a long history of tackling issues , which reflect modern day life and with the growing awareness of @entity102 this is an issue that has very much been brought to the forefront			2
' we consulted a number of organisations when developing the storyline and characters , and have taken advice from the @entity2 â€™s editorial policy advisers to ensure the material is appropriate for the time slot			0
