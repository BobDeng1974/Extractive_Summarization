moments after the @entity2 finished burying the @entity3 31 - 17 at @entity4 , 80,000 poppies were supposed to rain down from the sky and cover the pitch in honour of @entity8			1
it may be just as well that did n’t happen because for the @entity3 , who will be returning to @entity4 next october to host the @entity12 , the finish of sunday ’s game is a moment they ’ll likely want to forget			1
the @entity3 briefly held a 7 - 3 first quarter lead before a botched play on special teams led to the @entity2 scoring a touchdown and taking an advantage they would not relinquish			1
@entity24 , playing with two fractured vertebrae , was seldom pressured by @entity3 ' front seven @entity27 head coach @entity26 said that sequence of events ‘ really swung the tide ’			1
‘ i think we played a pretty solid football game after that , ’ he said			2
‘ making stops on defence , moving the ball , throwing it , and getting the running game going			2
’ after getting up by seven , @entity27 seemed content to let @entity3 hang around until quarterback @entity24 hit @entity40 with a second quarter touchdown pass that put the @entity2 up 17 - 7 after the extra point			1
the @entity2 did n’t look back after opening up the double - digit lead and kept the @entity3 off the board until @entity3 secured a safety in the fourth quarter when the outcome of the game was no longer in doubt			1
@entity49 became the first player in @entity52 history to rush for 100 - plus @entity53 in nine of the first 10 games @entity24 finished his day with 246 passing yards and three touchdowns before being replaced by backup @entity56			1
@entity40 caught two of those touchdowns and had 158 receiving yards on the day , a season high			2
@entity40 had a memorable day at @entity4 many of the 83,603 fans at @entity4 attempted to cheer on the @entity3 , but the team simply did not have the horses to keep up with a @entity2 team that appears playoff - bound			1
the @entity2 will fly home to the @entity68 with a badly - needed victory and , perhaps more importantly , a healthy @entity24			2
depending on the outcome of monday night ’s game between the @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity27 may enter their bye week in sole possession of first place in the @entity77			1
@entity24 said : ‘ you obviously want to have a chance to control your destiny and go out and do that			0
and we have that ability and guys have played hard and they put forth a lot of work and commitment to get to this point			0
and i 'm proud that they have got themselves and ourselves in this position			0
but no one has won anything yet			0
it 's all in front of you			0
you got to take it and move forward and get better			0
’ four of @entity27 ’ six remaining games are against divisional opponents , so the @entity2 playoff chances are truly in their own hands			2
according to @entity40 , the team will ‘ stay focused ’ and ‘ get better each and every day ’			0
he said : ‘ it 's good			0
we got to continue to keep our head down and focus on our goal , and we all know what that is			0
we got to stay together , play together , and hope for the best			0
’ the @entity3 will remain in the cellar of the @entity111 and once again be outside of the playoff picture looking in when postseason play begins in january			2
the exuberant @entity40 finished the day with six receptions , 158 yards and two touchdowns regardless of their failure to find success at @entity4 in 2014 , the @entity116 will return to the @entity119 and play as the home team in week 7 of the 2015 @entity52 season			1
although @entity27 wo n’t be returning next year , franchise owner @entity122 would like to see the @entity2 back in @entity123			2
he said : ‘ i would n’t dare elaborate under when , what , how , but again , this is attractive to our franchise			0
this is attractive to me			0
i like for our players to have these experiences			0
’ the @entity2 defense halt @entity3 running back @entity133 the @entity2 will never give up a home game to play at @entity4 , but @entity122 said the team would gladly travel to the @entity119 on a yearly basis if a team is permanently placed in @entity123			1
‘ on a personal basis and speaking for the @entity2 we very much would like to have a team in @entity123 , ’ @entity122 said			0
it has an air about it of international competition i think that @entity123 is probably one of two or three cities outside of the @entity147 that really does have all of the criteria that i would look at for having an @entity52 team			1
’ given the fond memories the @entity2 created on @entity152 against the @entity3 , it ’s not hard to see why @entity122 would want @entity27 to return as soon as possible			1

@entity27 scored *28* *unanswered* points and won by a final *margin* of 31 - 17
@entity3 quarterback @entity157 was *sacked* four times during team 's ninth loss
@entity52 's leading rusher @entity49 had 100 yards in @entity27 victory
