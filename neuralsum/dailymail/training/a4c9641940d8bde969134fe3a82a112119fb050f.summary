@entity0 is confident @entity1 have finally resolved the hamstring issue that has ruined @entity4 ’s season			1
the @entity6 midfielder had been @entity1 ’s outstanding performer but he has spent much of the past two months on the sidelines			1
he missed six games after being injured in a @entity11 tie in @entity12 on november 27 but then returned for two matches against @entity14 and @entity15 but was substituted in both			1
@entity0 , though , is satisfied that they have got to the bottom of the problem and he is predicting @entity4 will not be troubled by such injuries in the future			1

we need to make sure when he comes back he is 100 per cent ready for the second half of the season			2
it is making sure over the next three or four weeks we get everyone fit and ready			2
@entity4 , pictured during the @entity39 derby , played against @entity14 and @entity15 but had to be replaced ‘ we have got to the bottom of it and it will help him for the rest of his career			1
we have looked at his nutrition and how he recovers			0
he is a very peculiar profile of a midfielder as he is more of a sprinter			0
midfielders are usually about stamina			0
‘ but @entity4 is a sprinter and those players need extra care			1
i think we have got to the bottom of it and now we have to make sure we manage it			0
i am sure when he will be back , he will be back for good			0
' @entity1 have not won since december 15 but manager @entity0 is looking forward to taking on @entity19 @entity1 have not won since december 15 but @entity0 has no fear about facing @entity19			1

‘ a real determination of wanting to succeed			0
we defended well and we did not accept it was going to go away			0
that pleased me more than anything			0
