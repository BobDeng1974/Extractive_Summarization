two boys were rescued from an @entity2 sweat shop after watching an 11 - year - old friend get clubbed to death by a fellow child worker			1
the 13 - year - olds , who typically toiled from 8am to 10pm and then slept on the bangle factory floor , were ordered by bosses to cover up the crime after the attacker fled by washing away the blood			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , whose names have been changed to protect their identities , were then trapped in a tiny room and forced to spend 24 hours with the bloody corpse and its smashed skull			1
@entity20 pain : @entity13 , left , and @entity12 were ordered to wash the crime spot when another worker , aged 11 , was allegedly murdered by another boy , who has since run away from the @entity26 bangle factory where they worked they and the seven other children trapped in the bangle workshop , based in a two - storey house in capital @entity26 , were only freed when neighbours heard cries and called the police			1
the pair , who earned just 1,000 rupees - or £ 11 - a month , are now being looked after by a charity but remain traumatised by their ordeal			1
‘ we would wake up at 8am and , only after washing our faces , would start making bangles			2
work ended by 10 at night by when each of us made 25 packets of bangles , ' said @entity13			2
' barely able to move a muscle , we would fall asleep right where we worked			0
' he and @entity12 , who are both from @entity49 , a village 600 miles from @entity26 , were sent by their parents to work at the sweat shop in the @entity55 district in a bid to pay off their mounting debts			1
‘ how will my family survive if i do n’t send home money ? ’ asks @entity12 , who speaks like an adult despite his young age			0
suffering : @entity13 was sold by his parents to the sweat shop where he slept after toiling from morning till night @entity12 has seven brothers and sisters			1
his mother is blind and his father is an out - of - work contractor			0
his 19 - year - old sister is about to get married and the family is steeped in debts			0
the pair made bangles with the victim as well as the murderer			2
but the employer also manufactured polythene bags in the same building and exploited seven other children in that business			0
it was these children who were forced to join @entity12 and @entity13 and spend an horrific 24 hours with the body of their friend , who authorities are calling @entity89 in a bid to protect his real identity			1
‘ we knew something was wrong			0
we never saw any children come out of the building , ’ a resident said			0
appalling : the bangle factory in @entity26 where the boys were each forced to make 25 packets a day the children who worked at the bangle factory are all aged below 14 , and @entity2 's @entity101 bars the employment of children below that age in hazardous works			2
according to @entity106 of ngo @entity107 , which is looking after the two children , the @entity110 , in an affidavit before the high court , had pledged to make @entity114 a child labour - free zone			0
‘ that was in 2009 and we ’re still looking at a hub of unregulated factories where many stories perhaps more heinous than those of @entity13 , @entity12 or @entity89 remain untold , ’ he said .			0
