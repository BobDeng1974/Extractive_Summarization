@entity0 is all but qualified for next month ’s season - end finale in @entity2 , dredging up another supreme effort on sunday to almost cement his place in the illustrious eight - man field			1
the 27 year - old @entity6 , who at the @entity7 expressed indifference about ‘ overplaying ’ to fight his way to the @entity10 , strained every sinew in saving five match points and win the @entity13 with a 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 6 , victory over world no 16 @entity14			1
the @entity17 jokingly gave him a two fingered salute as they collapsed upon each other at the net after another epic battle			0
last month @entity0 also saved five match points against him in the @entity24 final , which was to kick off a remarkable five - week run that will carry him all the way to the @entity28			1
@entity0 celebrates his @entity13 victory by spraying champagne inside the @entity32 building @entity0 falls back onto the court as he clinches a gruelling three - set victory against @entity14 @entity0 plays a forehand as he fights back from a set down and saves five match points in the final @entity0 can seal qualification for the @entity28 by reaching the quarter - finals of this week 's @entity40			1
even if he was to lose his opening match , all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season - ending finale in @entity2 : @entity0 will drag his battered frame to the @entity40 this week but the hard work is surely done with this third title in 31 days , which has seen him win 17 out of 19 matches and revive a year that had fallen short of his usual standards			1
at @entity52 he pledged not to overdo it in trying to make the prestigious @entity2 event which offers huge ranking points and prize money , but has had a strange way of showing it ever since			0
the result has been a surge up to the fifth qualifying place , and even if he was to lose his opening match in @entity62 – where he has a bye into the second round - there would need to be an extraordinary confluence of results to keep him out			2
the arithmetic is infernal , but it will take stellar @entity62 performances from @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 to pull off the mathematical miracle required			0
@entity0 missed the whole of the late season twelve months ago after undergoing back surgery and had not won a tournament prior to @entity78 but it is now possible he will end the season back in the top four			2

@entity87 ( @entity88 ) - 9,010pts 2			0
@entity89 ( @entity90 ) - 8,520 3			2
@entity91 ( @entity92 ) - 6,835 - out 4			0
@entity93 ( @entity90 ) - 4,805 5			0
@entity0 ( @entity94 ) - 4,295 6			1
@entity95 ( @entity96 ) - 4,265 7			0
@entity97 ( @entity98 ) - 4,150 * 8			0
@entity70 ( @entity99 ) - 4,105 9			0
@entity71 ( @entity92 ) - 3,865 --- --- --- --- --- --- -- 10			0
@entity72 ( @entity100 ) - 3,840 11			0
@entity73 ( @entity101 ) - 3,565 * @entity97 qualifies as @entity7 champion the question is how much he will have left in the tank for the last two significant events of the year after pulling himself around @entity106 and then making unscheduled entries into @entity108 and @entity13 , which he won as part of a nine - match winning streak			1
above him the wider intrigue will surround @entity89 and his attempts to join @entity116 – who beat @entity117 to win the @entity119 year - end finale in @entity120 on sunday – as the season ’s official number one player at the ripe old age of 33			2
@entity89 , who won the @entity28 event in @entity125 on sunday by beating @entity126 6 - 2 6 - 2 , will be tired but not as much as @entity0 , who is now due to compete for his sixth week in succession			1
one of the last players you would wish to meet under the circumstances is @entity14 , who is like his fellow @entity131 32 year - old @entity71 in having remarkable stamina to cover enormous mileage			2
@entity0 has beaten them both in his three recent finals and needed to overcome them both this weekend , and it was amazing his legs could take the strain			0
at times in the three hour and 20 minute final he looked on the verge of keeling over and lost his temper several times , with even the indefatigable @entity14 showing signs of cramping as they went down the stretch again			2
while @entity0 ’s fighting spirit will be the abiding memory of one of the tennis year ’s best contests the fact is that he could have wrapped it up in straight sets			0
he was a little tentative on his six break points in the first set and should have gone a double break up for 5 - 2 in the second			0
@entity14 had two match points before @entity0 came through 9 - 7 in the subsequent tiebreak			1
in the second tiebreak @entity14 got to 6 - 5 and pushed @entity0 way into the corner , but he somehow managed to keep the rally going to stay alive before saving two more , and then reeling off three winning combinations from 7 - 8 down			1
that brings 500 points – double the haul from @entity168 or @entity108 – and it should mean the home crowd will get to see this remarkable competitor by the @entity171 early next month			0
@entity14 looks fired up as he pushes @entity172 all the way in a tight three - set @entity13 final a general view of the stunning @entity32 building as @entity0 takes on @entity14 for the title in @entity13 it was a heartbreaking defeat for @entity17 @entity14 who failed to capitalise on five match points against @entity0 in front of his home fans			1
it was the second time in a month that the @entity94 no 1 saved five match points against @entity14 , the last time being in the final of the @entity186 on september 28			1
and this time a shattered @entity14 reacted with a light - hearted double middle finger salute			2

@entity0 beat @entity14 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 6 to win the @entity13
@entity0 saved five match points in a final lasting three hours and 19 minutes
@entity0 moves up to fifth in the race to qualify for the @entity28
