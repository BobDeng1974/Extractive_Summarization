they may like a little @entity1 but @entity3 cars will no longer be powered by diesel if the country 's prime minister gets his way			1
as part of a wider environmental effort to be launched next year , @entity8 said @entity3 was overly reliant on the fuel and pledged to wean the country off it			1
' in @entity3 , we have long favored the diesel engine , ' he said			2
