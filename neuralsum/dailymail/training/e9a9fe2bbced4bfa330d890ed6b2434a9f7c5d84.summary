in the latest instalment of his weekly column , chief sports writer @entity0 gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week , saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver ... what 's hot mob justice ten days ago , @entity9 announced convicted rapist @entity10 would be training with them , as he bids to restart his career in football , following his rape conviction			1
dismissing those that considered this unwise , the club issued a high - minded statement : ' in a nation of laws , served by an elected parliament and duly constituted courts of law , there can be no place for " mob justice "			2
' on thursday , following the resignation of several club patrons and sponsors , widespread disgust and @entity33 's statement that she would no longer wish a @entity34 stand to be named after her if @entity10 returned to the club full - time , ' mob justice ' would appear to have found its place after all			1
@entity38 @entity37 apologising on @entity39 for controversial interview @entity9 have done a u-turn on @entity10 ( left ) after action from the likes of @entity33 the @entity45 gold medalist has a stand named after her at the @entity48 ' @entity34 ground an angry mob is never shy in taking action in @entity51 ' cartoon world of @entity52 confirming that @entity10 's training privileges had been withdrawn , @entity9 said : ' @entity54 have consulted dispassionately with the club 's supporters , vice presidents , @entity59 members , executives , staff , sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision			1
the club initially accepted a request from the @entity68 for @entity10 to be able to train			1
the reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced			0
' actually , it could			0
a first - year @entity74 student could have called this one			0
still , at least we know where @entity9 stand			1
unless it 's a really big mob			2
@entity79 travelling up to @entity81 this week , i bumped into @entity79 fresh from her memorable turn on @entity83			1
she was n't the best mover			0
but she was a fantastic sport â€“ and the @entity89 public love that even more			0
between posing for countless selfies with admirers , she said she realised how big the programme was when after the first episode she went up to watch the @entity94 at @entity95 and was forced to abandon walking the course a hundred yards down the first fairway			0
i said she did well to survive the backlash from son @entity100 's declaration for @entity102 independence			2
' he said if i got voted out in the first week , it would be all his fault , ' @entity79 confirmed			1
' i told him not to be so silly			2
if i went out in the first week it would be because i was s * * * *			0
' a true mum , @entity79			1
@entity79 during her final appearance on the @entity83 dancefloor with her partner @entity110 @entity111 come on , let 's face it , you were never happy with @entity115 , were you ? when @entity117 said he was one of the best right backs in the world , it was the first sign the @entity121 manager was losing it			1
yet who else was there ? @entity124 ? worse			0
@entity131 fans have been raving about @entity111 for over a year now , and this week he took his chance			1
he was beaten for pace by @entity135 's @entity134 early on at @entity136			1
after that , @entity138 barely got a kick and was eventually substituted			0
@entity141 , no slouch at right - back himself , was raving about @entity111 's defensive strengths after the game			1
@entity146 said the way he reacted to @entity138 's threat , adapted and won the day , was the hallmark of a good player			2
one imagines @entity121 coach @entity151 might know a good full - back , too			1
problem solved ? let 's hope so			2
@entity111 ( left ) got the better of @entity135 winger @entity134 ( right ) to help @entity121 win at @entity136 what 's not @entity37 you are the chairman of @entity158			1
you have just made a controversial managerial appointment , engaging a man currently under @entity162 investigation for using racially charged and homophobic language , albeit in private conversations			1
what do you do ? that 's right : deflect attention from him , by repeating the same material yourself in an interview with a left - leaning newspaper			2
@entity37 thinks everyone calls the @entity174 ' @entity173 ' and it is a statement of fact that @entity177 chase money			1
he probably does n't see the harm in slurs and stereotypes , even now			0
so here 's a reminder of where it leads			0
this is a page from an educational book , @entity187 , published in @entity188 in 1938			0
the first line of the narrative beneath reads , ' the @entity191 of the @entity177 is money			0
' not so far from what @entity37 said , if you think about it			2
an anti-semitic cartoon from an educational book , @entity187 , published in @entity188 in 1938 @entity158 chairman @entity37 ( right ) appointed @entity198 as the club 's new manager on wednesday @entity201 f * * * the @entity202 ? of course			1
f * * * all terrorists			0
f * * * anyone who so lacks empathy for their fellow man that they can slaughter , not combatants , but innocents			0
yet is this really a message that needs underlining during @entity121 internationals ? when @entity216 scored his first goal for @entity121 in more than a year on tuesday , he might have thought it would have been received with more than a reminder of a bloody chapter in @entity89 history , thankfully resolved			2
it has nothing to do with football			0
a ' @entity226 ' banner , inreference to the @entity202 , was spotted at @entity136 on tuesday evening @entity228 another two weeks out			1
so now we know for certain			0
there was no grand scheme , no brilliant strategy			0
@entity235 went for the marquee names that were available , and here is the consequence			2
they bought a very expensive , injury prone , player in a position that was already well staffed			0
still , no doubt @entity243 was abuzz			0
@entity228 ( right ) has spent more time watching than playing football since joining @entity235			1

@entity9 have now told @entity10 he can not train with them
@entity10 is a convicted rapist and club performed u-turn after widespread disgust from the likes of @entity33
@entity79 was voted off @entity253 's @entity83
@entity111 starred for @entity121 in victory against @entity135
some @entity121 fans chanted ' no surrender to the @entity202 ' during the match
@entity37 appointed @entity198 as @entity158 manager despite @entity162 investigation into the @entity263 over racist and homophobic messages
@entity228 has suffered another injury *setback* for @entity235
