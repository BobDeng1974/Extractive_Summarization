by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:50 est , 25 august 2013 while you might think being called @entity2 or @entity3 is n't much to write home about , spare a thought for those saddled with @entity7			1
and it could be worse because you could going through life as mr @entity11 , @entity12 or even miss @entity13			0
now the story of those names - and many others - has been brought to life by author @entity18 in his new book , what 's in a surname ? a journey from @entity23 to @entity24			1
geography : many of the @entity28 's surnames , including @entity29 and @entity30 , derive from place names while the unfortunately named @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 are the most eye - catching , @entity18 also offers an insight into better - known names that have made it into the modern period			1
@entity28 names , he explains , fall roughly into four categories : those derived from occupation ( @entity44 ) , those handed down by fathers ( @entity47 ) , those that come from place names ( @entity29 ) and nicknames such as @entity51 or @entity52			1
' occupational names are full of hazards , ' writes @entity18 in the @entity55			1
' @entity56 ? that sounds easy enough			0
a man who owns or runs a farm			0
but farmer used also to mean tax collector			0
' @entity62 ? a peripatetic poet , possibly ; but also a man who made rims for wheels			0
reader is not just someone who reads ( when many could n't ) ; it may well mean thatcher			0
roots : names that end with - s ( @entity73 ) originate in @entity74 but that end in - thwaite come from the @entity76 ' @entity77 was n't a name for someone who walked			2
a @entity77 carried out the same work – treading or crushing cloth – as a @entity83 elsewhere			0
' interestingly , @entity18 also discovered that many names also have geographical origins , with those that end in - son indicating northern roots , while names that end with - s - @entity73 for instance - have @entity74 origins			2
those whose names end in - by , - thwaite , - wick and - dale tend to originate in the @entity76 , while names that are prefixed by @entity94 - , @entity95 - and @entity96 - come from @entity98			2
the @entity28 's most common name @entity101 , although often thought to be @entity99 , actually originates in @entity102 , while surnames beginning with @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 - are overwhelmingly @entity74 in origin			1
