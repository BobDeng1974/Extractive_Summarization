she is planning to appeal @entity41 's decision and says : ' i ca n't split myself in half and be at both schools at the same time			2
' @entity22 's brothers go to the school			2
so it just makes sense for @entity22 and @entity49 to go there as well			0
i just do n't know what i 'm going to do			0
' ms @entity5 added she is concerned there will be a delay in arranging a care plan for @entity22 , who has type 1 diabetes and needs four daily insulin injections , while she awaits the appeal outcome			2
one in ten children across @entity35 missed out on their first choice of school when the allocations were announced this morning			0

there were a total of 82 preferences for 30 places			0
' the school 's governing body ranked all 82 applications according to the published criteria , but the children concerned did not fall into the highest priorities , and so were not offered a place			0
' only one preference was listed on the application form , and so because that preference could not be met , a place was offered at the school nearest to the home address with places			0
' the parents have the right of appeal to an independent appeal panel			0
