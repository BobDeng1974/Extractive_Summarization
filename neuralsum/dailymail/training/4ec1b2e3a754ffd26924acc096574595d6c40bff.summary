@entity0 says it is ‘ nonsense ’ that his old @entity3 team - mate @entity2 is not on the short list for world footballer of the year			1
oh well , only one of the three occasions on which the @entity8 has bitten an opponent actually took place during the @entity12 finals , which are the ultimate showpiece of the global game			0
so what ’s all the fuss about ? @entity0 ' ca n't believe ' that former @entity3 striker @entity2 is n't on the @entity18 shortlist @entity2 was on fire for @entity3 last term , but hit controversy again in the summer @entity2 's year took a significant turn for the worse when he opted to bite @entity23 in july @entity24 is bewildered at being banned and fined for tweeting the word ‘ sket ’ to imply that the mother of one of his critics on social media is a ‘ promiscuous woman , ’ by dictionary definition			1
oh come on , he only told someone who questioned his abilities as a centre half to ‘ get ya mum in , plays the field well			0
’ so since his @entity40 manager @entity39 is at pains to assure us he ’s ‘ a top - class person , ’ who ’s to take offence ? @entity40 defender @entity24 has been given a three - game suspension by the @entity46 @entity24 has been charged for this tweet , made on september 1 , for using the slang term ' sket ' and to think i ’ve always argued that the football authorities would be better advised electing their presidents , chairmen , chief executives and board members from among our leading players			1
both these men have captained @entity59			0
both are being canvassed for high office when they come to the end of their playing careers , which is fairly imminent			0
@entity24 is actually campaigning to become @entity65 ’s representative at @entity66 and is already a member of @entity46 chairman @entity69 ’s eccentric commission which is supposed to be researching ways of improving our national game			1
@entity39 criticised @entity24 's ban and believes footballers would be better off without @entity77 @entity0 and @entity24 have been outstanding players , for @entity3 and @entity79 respectively			1
each has given sterling service to @entity59			0
but one ca n’t see the obvious , that @entity2 has forfeited his place on the @entity18 list alongside the likes of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
the other does n’t grasp that smearing the morals of a mother he has never met is as obscene as the racist slurs to which he himself has been so vilely subjected			2
@entity24 comes across as a natural successor to @entity98 president @entity97 so we are left with little or no option but to conclude that most of their brains are in their boots			1
@entity0 is said to be still considering his future			2
judging by his latest interview … careful			0
@entity107 might switch his ambitions to @entity98			0
during his deconstructed ramblings on @entity110 this week he came across as the natural successor to @entity97 , who is forever busy proving that even all - time world class footballers do not make presidents			2
seems there really is only one @entity115			0
@entity0 should know that @entity2 forfeited his place in the @entity18 shortlist because of the bite			1

@entity0 thinks it 's nonsense @entity2 is n't up for the @entity18
@entity24 has defended himself for calling a mother a ' @entity123 '
football authorities should elect their members from leading players
@entity24 is actually campaigning to become @entity65 ’s rep at @entity66
but it 's time for a rethink : both ca n't see that these two opinions are *wrong*
we are left with little or no option but to conclude that most of their brains are in their boots
