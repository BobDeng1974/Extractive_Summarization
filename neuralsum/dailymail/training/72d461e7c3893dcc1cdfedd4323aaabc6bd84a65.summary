new dna analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the @entity5 in warmer climates in @entity14 and @entity15 , where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago			1
it had been known there were two safe havens for humans as the @entity5 reached its peak 26,000 years ago - the ‘ @entity25 - @entity24 ’ area , roughly coinciding with northern @entity23 and southern @entity14 , and the ‘ periglacial province ’ on the @entity28 plains			2
now researchers say another group sat out the ice age in @entity15 in the countries surrounding the @entity7			2
this helps explain mitochrondial dna in modern @entity35 from two lineages , @entity37 and @entity38 , which originated in the @entity39			0
until recently it was thought these lines migrated to @entity35 in the @entity43 age , approximately 9,000 years ago			1
however , the new research suggests that humans belonging to the @entity37 and @entity38 haplogroups actually migrated to @entity35 19,000 years ago - allowing them to repopulate @entity35 when the @entity5 drew to a close			1
dr @entity48 , of the @entity49 , said : ‘ the end of the @entity51 ( @entity5 ) allowed people to recolonise the parts of @entity35 that had been deserted and this expansion allowed increase of human populations			0
’ the @entity7 : new dna analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the @entity5 in warmer climates in @entity14 and @entity15 , where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago she believes using archaeogenetics like those used in the study has important lessons to teach humanity , as everyone came from a common group			1
writing for the @entity69 , she said : ‘ it helps us to reevaluate the perception of our identity			0
‘ we are highly focussed on identifying ourselves as @entity74 , @entity2 or whatever , but by analysing dna we discover that originally , not such a long time ago , we came from a common source			0

@entity34 shows humans sheltered in southern @entity35
ice age ended 20,000 years ago
