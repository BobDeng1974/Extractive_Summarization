' it honestly felt like it was going to explode			0
' the plastic surgeons said i was lucky not to lose the thumb because the poison had gone into the muscle			2
' they had to knock me out to slice it open in a huge zig - zag shape and peel back the skin like a banana to get to all of the poison			2
' but they had to leave it all open so they could get back in the next day to check for more , and i was in hospital for four days			2
