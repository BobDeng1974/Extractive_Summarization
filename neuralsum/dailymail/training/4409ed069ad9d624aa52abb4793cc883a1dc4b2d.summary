by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 9 september 2013 sharp - eyed mobile internet users have spotted what could be a new logo for @entity4			1
while the internet giant has not suggested it is searching for a new look , hints of a slicker logo have appeared in the latest version of its mobile internet browser			1
if the ' new ' logo spotted is indeed @entity4 's latest look , the shadows and beveling has been removed from the primary coloured lettering			2
is this @entity4 's new branding ? the logo is hidden away in the latest beta release of @entity19 for @entity20 , which is largely used by app developers and is probably not meant to be seen yet as well as the flat appearance of the letters , they are more muted in colour and the overall appearance of the logo looks more modern			1

the cleaner logo was being used for a new tab page but it was quickly pulled - presumably by someone who might have feared the cat had been let out of the bag			0
@entity4 's current logo is brighter and is composed of beveled letters with shading , unlike the ' new ' one however , @entity40 spotted it can also be seen on @entity4 's servers by changing the number in the url of @entity4 's current logo to : @entity45			2
the tech community has therefore deduced that the flat design of the logo has been produced by @entity4 but there is no confirmation about whether it will be rolled out			1
one person said to be familiar with the change in branding told @entity54 that the flat logo will not replace the current branding in the near future @entity58 recently unveiled a new logo ( pictured ) to generally negative reviews after teasing the new design with a month of logos if the logo is introduced across @entity4 's product range , it will be the first redesign of its logo since 2010 when it tweaked the colours to make it brighter and reduced the amount of shading in the letters			2
