the @entity1 has suspended activities for its men 's rugby team after officials there said an audio recording captured some team members chanting a song with lyrics that seemed to condone abuse toward women and even necrophilia			1
in an email to the university community on march 19 , president @entity13 said the school imposed sanctions because the team 's actions violated its code of conduct for club sports			1
according to the school , the recording featured several team members at an off - campus party at the end of the fall semester			1
officials say the chant contained sexually explicit , derogatory and violent language			0

' she was right and dead ... well g * * d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ' the november 2014 incident was recorded by a male partygoer -- sans video -- with a phone and uploaded to @entity78 , @entity73 reports			2
it was soon reported to the administrations			0
in the months thereafter , the school 's chapter of @entity83 got involved , with their president @entity84 writing an opinion piece in the school paper when the club decided initial sanctions against the team were n't enough			1
' as soon as @entity83 started affecting change on campus , we were faced with aggression and hatred , ' @entity84 wrote , saying the group was attacked anonymously through the app @entity97			1
the group perservered , however , and in early march , they publicly released a transcript of the chant			2
with still no response , the group took things a step further by releasing audio of the chant to several news outlets on march 18			2
that same day , president @entity13 informed the team of their punishment			2
some students have been exposed to the ' offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media , ' @entity13 wrote			0
@entity116 : the @entity118 chapter fought for the team to be punished			0
they were targeted by members of the student body , who attacked them through the anonymous app @entity125 at an off - campus party at the close of the fall 2014 semester , several members of @entity131 men 's rugby club engaged in a chant that contained sexually explicit , derogatory , and violent language			1
some students have now been exposed to those offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media			0
no student on this campus should feel unsafe , ostracized , or threatened			0
understanding that the offensive chant is antithetical to @entity1 values , and will not be tolerated , the @entity1 pursued action against the men 's rugby club			1
at the beginning of the current semester , sanctions were imposed on the rugby club for willful violations of @entity1 's code of conduct for club sports			1
after an appeal by the accused , the disciplinary process concluded on march 18 with this ruling : all rugby club activities have been suspended indefinitely			1
further , each member of the men 's rugby club is required to participate in education and training sessions regarding sexual assault and violence			1
@entity1 's @entity161 informed the process and response to this situation			2
as i stated yesterday , the @entity1 will not stand for such behavior			2
it not only violates our community values , it is not how members of this collegial campus live , and it is not reflective of the @entity1 we all know and love			1
university policies prohibit discrimination , harassment , threats , and derogatory statements of any form			0
we pride ourselves on being a diverse , accepting , caring community , and we must live up to that ideal			0
i urge anyone on campus who feels unsafe , ostracized or threatened to immediately contact campus police or dr. @entity183 , special assistant to @entity184			0
she may be reached at lcox@umw.edu or 540 - 654 - 2119			0
@entity185 president source ' no student on our campus should feel unsafe , ostracized , or threatened , ' @entity13 continued			0
' we pride ourselves on being a diverse , accepting , caring community , and we must live up to that ideal			0
' other sanctions imposed at the beginning of the semester were appealed and upheld			0
in addition , the team must participate in sensitivity training and education sessions			1
messages left for the contact listed for the rugby team through the school 's website and a campus women 's rights group were not immediately returned			2
the incident at the @entity208 school follows recent news of a fraternity at the @entity211 that was disbanded after its members were caught on video engaging in a racist chant			0
last week , @entity215 also disbanded a fraternity chapter after the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus			0
the @entity1 was founded in 1908 and has about 4,000 undergraduate students			2
censured : the school administration doubled down on an earlier censure of the rugby club by suspending their activities indefinitely and requiring them to attend sexual assault education courses			1

the president of the @entity1 in @entity231 , @entity229 suspended its rugby club indefinitely starting march 19
@entity234 *emerged* from a rubgy party last fall in which men can be heard saying ' finally found a whore , she was right and dead '
a clash soon broke out , one that seemed to *coalesce* in the rubgy team versus the @entity83 club and the team eventually lost
in addition to losing their club *privileges* , the team members have been required to attend sexual assault training classes
