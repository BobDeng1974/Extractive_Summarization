by @entity0 last updated at 4:30 pm on 1st march 2012 @entity1 announced yesterday that adverts will appear on the 425m mobile devices used to access the social network			1
the move follows the roll - out of adverts on users ' news feeds , which began in early january			1
this means that brands you ’ve endorsed by hitting the ‘ like ’ button will now be able to push deals and other updates right into the news feeds that show your friends ' updates , photos and links			1
the changes come ahead of @entity1 's initial public offering of stock , expected this spring			1
the ipo could value the company at as much as $ 100 billion ( £ 62billion )			1
that means @entity1 has to prove it can bring in real advertising revenue from massive brands			1
like ? adverts will appear on the mobile version of @entity1 sea - ing is believing : adverts will now appear on log - out screens ‘ @entity1 is making serious money from ads right now , but they are not making serious money from major brand advertisers			1
that 's where the ad money is , ’ said @entity34 , an analyst with the @entity35			1
‘ they currently have rather low - rent , shoddy ads on @entity1			1
’ that could change as @entity1 starts integrating brands ' messages into the news feeds of its 845 million users as part of a long - term vision of moving from ads to stories about brands			1
however industry analysts have reservations about the move			1
@entity59 , a social - media expert and web entrepreneur , warned the social network could end up ‘ irritating their user base by inundating them with ads ’			1
@entity69 5 @entity68 's internet expert @entity67 , meanwhile , told @entity70 : ' @entity71 is the fastest growing area for @entity1 , along with gaming , so it 's not at all surprising they 're introducing mobile ads. now 's the time to experiment , before it becomes a fully public company			1
it just has to be careful			2
' he added that the timing of the announcement could n't be better for the social network giant			2
' while @entity85 is distracting the relevant consumer technology journalists , @entity84 's privacy is under the spotlight and @entity88 are combatting the controversy around their app policy relating to mobile contacts - they 've made a play to advertisers whilst trying to keep this under wraps to their users , ' he said			1
@entity97 , managing director at @entity99 - based @entity98 , a company that provides internet marketing services , said : ' i can understand that @entity1 is doing what it can to stay profitable in the highly competitive social media space , especially with the ipo just around the corner			2
there is an atmosphere of uncertainty around @entity1 ’s revenue model and this will go some way to satisfy potential investors			2
' the downside of course is that @entity1 users may see this as being " spammy " and negatively impact on @entity1 ’s biggest asset – user experience			2
risking the " stickiness " of the site could be a dangerous game , especially with the likes of @entity123 and @entity124 challenging for market share			2
' @entity1 made the announcement at the @entity127 in @entity128 in a rare @entity130 appearance for a @entity132 company			2
rather than bombarding people with flashy ads , @entity1 is urging companies to integrate themselves into what people are already doing on the site - talking to their friends and family , commenting on photos or posting news links			2
cashing in : @entity144 's social media network is thought to be worth over £ 60billion ‘ the definition of the word “ advertise ” is to draw attention to , ’ said @entity148 , @entity1 's vice president of product			1
‘ the definition of a story is narration , which you 'd think is what people prefer			0
’ @entity1 has a vast trove of information about its users ' lives , hobbies , likes and dislikes , yet the company has kept advertising fairly unobtrusive to date			0
ads for teeth - whitening , wineries and laundry detergent and the like are relegated to the right side of users ' facebook pages			0
over time , web - savvy users have grown used to ads and many are tuning them out			0
those ads are not going away , but brands will now be able to push updates - or as @entity1 likes to call , ‘ stories ’ - right into the news feeds			0
@entity1 's challenge will be to keep these ads as unobtrusive as possible so that users are not alienated or driven to ‘ unlike ’ brands			1
‘ i think they understand that people value authenticity , ’ said @entity181 , ceo of @entity182 , a marketing software company for businesses			0
‘ the new page format and the new ad format encourage authenticity and storytelling			0
’ companies can continue to set up @entity1 pages on their brands for free			0
they 'd pay to insert updates into news feeds and elsewhere based on the number of fans they have			0
in other words , posting the message will remain free , but getting more people to see it will cost money			0
@entity1 will collect feedback and test how users respond as it rolls out the changes gradually			0
at first , users may see just one message a day from a brand inside their news feed , or even less			0
and they wo n't see messages from random companies they are not connected to in some way - directly or through a friend			0
‘ @entity1 has certainly backed down on things , ’ @entity34 said			0
‘ but they are not just going on what people say			0
they are going on what they do			0
’ beyond the updates within news feeds , @entity1 will also start showing ads when people log out of the site .			0

potentially *unpopular* move is rolled out while spotlight is on @entity84 's privacy policy , says tech expert
