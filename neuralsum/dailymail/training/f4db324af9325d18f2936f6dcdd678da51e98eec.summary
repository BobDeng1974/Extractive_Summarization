she said : ‘ i think it ’s a really inappropriate image , which in my view promotes sexual discrimination and the sexualisation of women			2
it has undertones which are almost creepy – three guys standing by the side of the road in a pack with their eyes obviously drawn to the woman ’s behind			0
foaming with anger : it had been claimed the poster portrayed everyday @entity20 life - instead it was accused of ' everyday sexism ' ‘ i was extremely shocked to be faced with such blatant leering at women			1
it just is n’t the sort of image @entity64 should be promoting			0
