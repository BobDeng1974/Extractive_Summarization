by @entity0 as 350,000 students prepare to graduate this july , the @entity1 could this year face a potential ' brain - drain ' as graduates move abroad in search of better career opportunities			1
a study , which questioned 500 young people of graduation age , explored attitudes towards travelling and working abroad , and was commissioned to help student and traveller shipping specialist , @entity7 understand ‘ gen y ’ moving trends			2
it found that instead of putting their hard earned degree to good use , 47per cent of young people were planning to move abroad in the next 12 months , while 23per cent were actively considering it			0
it is thought as much as 70 % of graduates will look to move abroad rather than enter the world of work the majority ( 43per cent ) were planning to do this for the medium - long term ( up to 5 years ) , while 11per cent predicted they would remain overseas for more than five years			1
the top destinations emerged as @entity33 ( 58per cent ) , @entity34 ( 34per cent ) , @entity35 ( 26per cent ) @entity36 ( 23per cent ) , and @entity37 ( 19per cent ) while the top reasons for wanting to move abroad were better job prospects ( 47per cent ) , spiralling living costs in the @entity1 ( 26per cent ) or disillusionment with @entity1 politics ( 21per cent )			1
recent @entity44 figures suggest that graduates contribute to the @entity1 economy almost 10 times what it costs the state to educate them , in turn bringing in £ 180,000 more to the economy than those with a-levels over their working life			2
this continued trend could therefore impede the @entity1 ’s fragile economic recovery			1
@entity58 , from @entity7 said : ' a good proportion of our customer base is made up of young people – often graduates – who decide to defer the world of work in favour of travelling or working abroad			0
this can be for a variety of reasons , and often it ’s a case of balancing the need to build a career with the opportunity to experience new cultures and gain valuable life experiences			0
' however , whatever the reasons for travelling , careful planning is key , and that ’s where a cost - effective and reliable shipping service can play its part			0

11 % will go for more than five years
potential economic impact on the @entity1 could be huge
