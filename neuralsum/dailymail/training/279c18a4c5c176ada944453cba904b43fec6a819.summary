by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 treasury minister @entity2 claims 3.3million jobs are linked to @entity6 's membership of the @entity7 three million @entity11 jobs will be put in peril if the @entity11 quits the @entity7 , an official @entity9 study suggests			1
as @entity14 hints he could back an exit if @entity16 rebuffs his calls for reform , @entity3 treasury minister @entity2 will use a speech today to highlight the ‘ risk that isolationists would have us take ’			1
he will tell an audience in @entity24 that government experts have calculated that 3.3 million jobs are ‘ connected ’ to @entity6 ’s @entity7 membership , and the rise of @entity29 does not mean @entity6 is ‘ on the brink of exiting the @entity7 ’			1
@entity31 remains the biggest source of tension between the @entity34 and @entity3 in the coalition			0
mr @entity2 will defy the @entity36 to release new analysis on the number of jobs linked to the @entity7			2
it is understood he asked civil servants in the @entity9 to calculate the link between @entity7 membership and employment two months ago , but was warned by @entity46 ’s aides against making it public			0
senior @entity34 are thought to be concerned the data contradicts claims from @entity50 in the party that @entity6 could thrive and prosper if it goes it alone			2
mr @entity14 has promised that if he wins the next election , he will seek to claw back powers form @entity16 before staging an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			0
@entity6 has grown increasingly isolated in recent days , as mr @entity14 emerged as the lone voice in opposition to @entity60 @entity59 becoming president of the @entity62			1
the prime minister will push the issue to a vote at a summit in @entity16 on friday , despite almost all other 27 @entity7 leaders being in agreement that mr @entity59 should get the job			1
with relations souring , @entity70 has hinted that mr @entity14 the prime minister campaigning to leave the @entity7 if he does not get the reforms he wants from @entity16 in the coming years			2
but mr @entity2 , the chief secretary to the treasury , will dismiss the idea that the @entity6 is inching closer to withdrawing from the @entity7			1
‘ when the focus is on jobs , and growth , and wider risks we take with our prosperity through isolation then the argument can and will be won			0
indeed , the latest @entity9 analysis shows that 3.3 million @entity11 jobs are connected to @entity6 's place in @entity31			1
‘ that is the measure of the risk that isolationists would have us take			0
‘ @entity11 people want the jobs and opportunities that come with staying in the @entity7			2
‘ they want @entity6 to continue leading in @entity31 and they want @entity6 to remain a leading voice on the world stage			1
’ prime minister @entity14 , pictured this week with president of the @entity96 , @entity95 , wants to stage an in - out referendum on @entity31 before the end of 2017 mr @entity2 will argue that polls show support for remaining in @entity31 has risen in recent months , with an eight point lead for those who want to remain in			1
‘ despite seemingly increasing euro - scepticism in the @entity11 , we are not on the brink of exiting the @entity7 , ’ mr @entity2 will say			1
‘ doing so would be a disaster for @entity6 , putting our hard - fought economic recovery at risk			0
‘ and i do n’t believe the @entity11 public would vote to pull out of the @entity7 in the event a referendum is called			0
’ mr @entity2 will use the speech in the @entity114 capital to urge @entity114 to ‘ to stay engaged , speak out and help keep @entity6 in the @entity7 ’			1
three weeks ago @entity114 president @entity115 warned it is ‘ hard for me to imagine that project ( @entity7 ) going well in the absence of @entity6 ’			1
he added : ‘ i think it is also hard for me to image it would be advantageous for @entity6 to be excluded from political decisions that have an enormous impact on its economic and political life			0
’ mr @entity2 will point to president @entity115 ’s remarks , adding : ‘ we want to remain in … because @entity6 stands tall in the world – and dare i say in @entity24 – when we stand tall in @entity16 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
’ @entity6 's influence in @entity31 has been damaged by @entity14 's posturing over who will get the top jobs in @entity16 , @entity131 claimed today			1
the business secretary claimed mr @entity14 's robust opposition to @entity59 becoming president of the @entity62 ' has not helped @entity6 punch its weight in @entity31 '			1
mr @entity14 has vowed to fight ' until the end ' the appointment of a man seen by the @entity11 as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform			0
business secretary @entity131 claimed @entity14 's aggressive stance against @entity59 has ' not helped @entity6 punch its weight in @entity31 ' half of voters think @entity14 will be seen as ' strong ' for opposing @entity59 's appointment , even if he loses			1
a @entity151 poll for the @entity152 found just 22 people of people think the prime minister will be seen as weak if , as expected , mr @entity59 is named the new president of the @entity62			0
just 13 per cent of people think mr @entity14 is wrong to try and block the appointment			0
the public remains split on @entity6 's membership of the @entity7			2
the survey found 37 per cent would vote to stay in the @entity7 , while 36 per cent would vote to leave in a referendum			0
@entity163 and the @entity3 have publicly supported the @entity34 in insisting mr @entity59 is the wrong man for the job			0
but on the eve of a summit where mr @entity14 is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow @entity7 leaders , mr @entity131 also criticised his approach			1
' it has n't been good for @entity14 , ' mr @entity131 told @entity171 's today			2
' i think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president should n't be foisted on heads of government			0
' i think he was right to take the position he did but the way it 's been done , unfortunately , has not helped @entity6 punch its weight in @entity31			2
' mr @entity59 said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week , ' if common sense prevails '			0
in an apparent dig at the prime minister 's campaign against him , the former @entity186 premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was ' very unequally distributed '			0
mr @entity14 believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the @entity195 would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by @entity200			0
having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week 's @entity96 summit , speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane @entity7 procedure nicknamed the ' l - bomb ' to stop @entity59 's candidacy			2
the ' @entity186 compromise ' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of @entity210 at @entity211 being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an @entity7 member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found .			0
