by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 10:27 est , 24 january 2014 a three - year - old boy with epilepsy has been free of seizures for six months after surgeons ‘ disconnected ’ half of his brain			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , had up to 100 devastating seizures a day before the pioneering surgery			1
each severe seizure caused him to forget all of the skills he had learnt meaning his parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , had to keep teaching him to sit up and crawl over and over again			1
@entity8 ( right ) has a severe form of childhood epilepsy called @entity20 and had up to 100 fits a day			1
he is pictured with his brother , @entity21 , and parents @entity13 and @entity12 mrs @entity23 said : ‘ @entity24 has not had one seizure since his operation in june 2013 and it has transformed his life			2
‘ there is a huge difference in @entity8 , it ’s like having a different child as his development was affected but he ’s now learning new things all the time			1
‘ before the operation he had the abilities of a three - month - old , but since then he ’s been making improvements all the time			1
‘ he is more like a nine - month - old now , and wants to stand and try and walk , which was n’t possible before			0
he will always need additional support because of his health issues , but it is fantastic that @entity8 is no longer having seizures			2
’ @entity8 was diagnosed with @entity20 – a severe form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children – when he was just six weeks old			1
his parents took him to hospital because they noticed his face was twitching and were given the shocking diagnosis			0
@entity8 's fits could not be controlled with medication so doctors operated to disconnect the two hemispheres of his brain in a bid to stop his seizures			1
he has not had a fit since the operation took place in august 2013 mrs @entity23 told @entity59 : ‘ i had never heard of @entity20			1
i was very upset when i was told but i knew i had to get on with it			0
’ @entity20 causes seizures that tend to make the baby either bow forwards or lean backwards			2
it occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children			0
in 90 per cent of sufferers , the spasms first occur before they are one			0
@entity20 is a form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children			1
it causes seizures in which the child appears to either bow forward or lean backwards			0
it occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children			0
90 per cent of those affected develop symptoms within their first year of life			0
the condition is usually treated with drugs initially and if this is not successfully , the child may require surgery			0
most children with the condition go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most also have learning difficulties			1
the long - term prognosis for children with @entity20 depends mainly on the cause and the severity of the syndrome			2
source : @entity92 babies who have these spasms often have slow development and their development can even go backwards			0
some patients respond well to treatment while others continue to have spasms despite drug treatment			0
most @entity20 sufferers tend to go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most have learning difficulties			1
@entity8 ’s epilepsy was completely out of control despite a strict drug regime			2
this meant he had as many as 100 seizures a day which each lasted from between 30 seconds and six minutes			1
these seizures affected his development and meant he needed constant supervision			0
every time he learnt to do something – like to sit up – he would have a severe seizure and the skill would be wiped out			1
his parents were also having to call an ambulance frequently when they were unable to stop him fitting			0
mrs @entity23 , 34 , said : ‘ before @entity8 had the surgery he was on medication but his condition became so severe he was having up to 100 seizures a day			1
‘ it affected @entity8 ’s development , so he ’d learn things , and then lose the ability			2
he became so ill that an operation was needed to stop the seizures			2
’ when @entity8 was two , his doctors at @entity133 , @entity9 , suggested that he have an operation to ‘ disconnect ’ the two hemisphere of his brain in the hope this would stop his seizures			1
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ when i was told about the operation i was shocked because you do n’t think about having your brain separated			2
‘ but , i just wanted to stop the seizures			0
’ every time @entity8 had a severe fit he forgot all of the skills he had learnt meaning his parents had to teach him basic skills over and over again			1
he is pictured shortly after his operation in a desperate bid to help their son , @entity153 and mrs @entity23 agreed to allow him to have the eight hour procedure which was carried out in august at @entity155			0
during the operation – which is called a hemispherectomy - surgeons made a large cut above @entity8 ’s ear , and through his skull , to allow them access to his brain			1
they then disconnected the outer layer of one half of the brain - the half that was causing the seizures – from the other half			2
they carried out a procedure called a hemispherectomy			0
this involved disconnecting the outer layer of one half of his brain - the half that was causing the seizures - from the other half			1
in doing so , they disconnected the communication between the two hemispheres preventing the spread of electrical seizures from one side of the brain to the other			2
cutting the connection between the two sides of the brain disconnects the communication between the two hemispheres preventing the spread of electrical seizures from one side of the brain to the other			1
@entity133 , @entity9 neurological consultant , @entity193 , said : ‘ the operation was necessary as @entity8 had such a severe form of epilepsy			1
‘ we worked closely with colleagues in @entity199 to prepare him for surgery and it is fantastic that he is now seizure - free			0
’ @entity202 , the @entity155 brain surgeon who carried out the procedure , said : ‘ this was a very complicated and long operation and we are all delighted with how well @entity8 is doing			1
we look forward to seeing @entity8 as an outpatient next year			0
’ mrs @entity23 said that @entity8 , who is also partially paralysed on one side , started to show improvements about a week after his operation and that he is now completely free of seizures			1
she told @entity59 : ‘ it ’s the best thing we have ever decided to do for him			0
‘ it means everything – everything has improved			0
’ mr and mrs @entity23 , who also have a six - year - old son called @entity21 , are now looking forward to life without @entity8 being affected by seizures			1
mrs @entity23 told @entity59 : ' i am so grateful to the surgeons - they have changed his life and they have changed our lives			0
we will be happy if he stays seizure free and if he stays happy ' mrs @entity23 said : ‘ when he was ill he could n’t sleep because of the seizures and so neither could we			0
so @entity8 being well rested makes a difference to us all			0
‘ we ’re also able to go out more as a family , because when @entity8 was ill we could n’t go out if he was having a bad day			2
’ @entity8 is now able to retain what he has learnt and , while he ca n’t talk or feed himself , he is having physiotherapy to try and help him stand			2
mrs @entity23 told @entity59 : ‘ i am so grateful to the surgeons – they have changed his life and they have changed our lives			0
‘ we will be happy if he stays seizure free and if he stays happy			0
