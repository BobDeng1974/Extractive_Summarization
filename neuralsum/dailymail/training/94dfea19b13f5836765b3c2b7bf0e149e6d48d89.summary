by @entity1 reporter published : 22:19 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 22:19 est , 24 january 2013 a jury is deadlocked by one vote in charging a @entity5 woman with the murder of 4 - year - old foster child @entity7 who disappeared after being barbarically locked in a cage more than a decade ago			1
jurors in @entity10 revealed a vote of 11 to 1 on thursday in charging 67 - year - old @entity12 with the child 's murder which carries a potential life sentence			1
the note did not say which side had the majority or what the verdicts were on kidnapping and aggravated child abuse charges , which carry less severe sentences than murder			0
verdict is in : a verdict in the death of 4 - year - old foster child @entity7 , pictured , has been reached by jurors but with a deadlock by one vote on charging a @entity5 woman with murder prosecutors said @entity34 , who was @entity7 's caretaker , smothered the girl with a pillow in december of 2000 before disposing of her body , which has still never been found			1
the jury could opt for a less severe manslaughter charge rather than murder			2
all verdicts must be unanimous			0
' all of us are depending on you to make a wise and legal decision in this matter , ' circuit judge @entity42 told jurors earlier in the day			0
after more than three additional hours of deliberations @entity48 ordered the panel to return on friday morning to continue			0
authorities long suspected @entity34 in @entity7 's disappearance , but did n't charge her until 2005 when prosecutors said she confessed to an inmate while serving time on an unrelated fraud charge			1
that purported jailhouse confession by @entity34 to career criminal @entity57 became key evidence against her after @entity60 said @entity34 told her she did it because @entity7 was evil and demonic			1
before that in november , shocking court testimony and evidence revealed @entity7 was kept in a dog cage , tied to her bed with plastic restraints and forced for long periods to stay in a small laundry room as punishment for disobedience			2
trial : @entity7 ( right ) disappeared in 2000 aged four			1
her foster mother , @entity12 , now 67 , is on trial more than a dozen years later caged : @entity75 testifies in a @entity76 last november about the steel dog cage , left , she loaned @entity12 to put @entity7 in before the four - year - old child disappeared ' she was being brutalized			1
she was being punished to the extreme , ' assistant state attorney @entity79 said in closing arguments			0
prosecutors brought the wire dog cage into the court room and placed it in front of the jurors as @entity34 's friend @entity75 testified she loaned it to her specifically to keep the child in			1
she said @entity34 asked to borrow it and told her it was so she could keep the four - year - old in it at night ' to stop her from doing harm to herself '			2
however she did admit she had never seen her inside the cage			0
' i saw her in timeout but i never saw her in the dog cage , ' she said , adding that she had never saw @entity34 strike the child once			2
she also said the girl often seemed ' sad ' during her eight - month stay at the @entity34 home and once saw her play with feces			2
lost : @entity7 's body has never been found ' to me , she had some issues , some mental issues , ' @entity106 told jurors			1
@entity7 's name is an acronym for ' remember i love you always ' given by her birth mother			1
@entity34 has always maintained that a child welfare worker took @entity7 from her home in january 2001 and never returned her			1
her disappearance was not discovered for 15 months , leading to major reforms at the @entity118 and high - level resignations			1
a caseworker who failed to check up on @entity7 in person during all those months eventually pleaded guilty to official misconduct charges for falsifying time sheets			2
@entity34 's defense raised the possibility @entity7 might have been sold and could still be alive			1
they questioned the credibility of @entity128 — whose life sentence was cut to 10 years in exchange for her testimony — and the fact that no physical evidence exists showing a crime was committed			0
' there 's no evidence of it because my client never committed murder , ' said defense attorney @entity141			2
two other prison inmates also testified that @entity34 implicated herself in @entity7 's killing			1
friends and acquaintances said @entity34 told various stories about the girl 's disappearance , such as trips to @entity151 and @entity152			1
she also told investigators the girl , who was taken into care after being born to a crack - addicted mom , had been taken for mental tests by a state caseworker and never returned			2
authorities found no evidence to back up those explanations			2
before jurors began deliberations , three alternates were sent home but instructed by the judge not to talk to the media or read news account of the case until a verdict in the high - profile case is reached			0
in november another family friend , @entity172 , told jurors that she saw @entity7 with scratches and a gash on her forehead about two months before the girl ’s disappearance			1
she also said @entity34 told her the same story about her being taken to @entity152 by a friend			1
accused : @entity12 is sworn by a judge , pictured , at @entity76 where she is charged with the murder of @entity7 , who was in her care when she vanished in 2000 in the afternoon , a crime scene detective dispatched to @entity34 's home in @entity184 in 2004 , more than three years after @entity7 disappeared and after the family had already moved , testified that little forensic evidence was found at the home except for latent evidence of human bodily fluid or blood in the garage , according to @entity192			1
@entity34 's attorney raised the possibility that @entity7 could still be alive because her body has not been found			1
attorney @entity196 suggested @entity7 could 've been relocated to a new home and lost in a system that has a history of caseworker incompetence			0
@entity196 also reminded jurors that jailhouse snitches have much to gain for helping out prosecutors			0
' is there any evidence at all that this child is dead ? ' @entity196 said			0
' where is the body ? we do n't have to prove that she 's alive			0
they have to prove that this child is dead			0
' prosecutors said @entity34 confessed to killing @entity7 , who would be 16 now , because she believed the girl was evil and possessed by demons			1
@entity7 and a younger sister were both given over to state care because their drug - addicted , frequently homeless mother could not care for them			2
one now - retired @entity221 supervisor , @entity220 , testified that in april 2000 he received a call from @entity34 claiming @entity7 's first foster home was ' deplorable ' and might be unsafe			1
testimony : mrs @entity75 told the court that she saw the girl in timeout but never saw her in the dog cage she provided , adding that she had never saw @entity34 strike the child once @entity7 's younger sister was living with @entity34 and her unrelated companion , @entity231 , and @entity7 had recently visited their house			1
@entity220 said he decided to remove @entity7 from the first foster home when he was denied access to investigate its condition			0
he took the girl to the @entity239 ' home			0
' i thought it would be necessary to remove the child because i could n't prove whether she was at risk or not at risk , ' @entity220 testified			0
the key to the case , both sides agree , is the testimony of career criminal @entity57 , who befriended @entity34 in jail			2
@entity57 claims that @entity34 , referring to @entity7 as ' it , ' told her she smothered the girl with a pillow and buried the remains near water ' because water represented peace , ' @entity79 told jurors			1
another inmate also claims that @entity34 confessed at a different time			2
@entity79 said @entity57 was reluctant to snitch but ' could n't stomach ' knowing about the death of a child			0
' if you tell me you killed an innocent child , i 'm going to snitch , and i 'm going to snitch proud			0
because it 's different , ' @entity79 quoted @entity57 as telling detectives			0
@entity57 had been facing a life sentence as a repeat offender but has had her sentence reduced to 10 years because of her cooperation , court records show			0
with time off for good behavior , she could be released by the end of december , @entity196 pointed out			0
' she 's a rat , ' @entity196 said			0
' @entity57 would do anything , anything , to get out of prison			0
' @entity34 also has a checkered past , including a history of convictions for fraud			2
authorities said she has used 47 different aliases and had 10 different driver 's licenses when she was arrested			0
@entity79 said @entity34 forged documents falsely claiming she was @entity7 's grandmother in order to collect state benefits — even after police believed the girl was dead			1
