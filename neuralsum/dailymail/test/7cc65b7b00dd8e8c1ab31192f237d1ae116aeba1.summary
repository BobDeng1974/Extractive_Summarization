midfielder @entity0 has warned @entity1 must be ready to face a ' wounded animal ' at @entity3 on sunday , but will be ready to inflict more pain on @entity6 's men			1
the @entity8 champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches , thrashed 4 - 2 at rivals united last weekend - a result which left the long - term future of manager @entity6 in doubt as @entity3 might now face a scrap with @entity19 for a @entity21 qualifying spot			1
@entity1 are also in need a pick - me - up , having seen victory slip through their fingers when @entity25 netted a stoppage time equaliser at @entity27			2
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is wary of facing champions @entity3 on sunday @entity3 midfielder @entity29 ( centre ) and his team - mates suffered a 4 - 2 defeat at @entity33 last week @entity35 midfielder @entity0 expects @entity3 to produce a response , but also one from @entity38 's squad , who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the @entity45 places			1
' anything is possible in football , but we must n't forget who we are up against			0
they are a wounded animal , because they need points , so they have to wake themselves up to win , ' @entity0 said on the club 's official website , www.whufc.com			1
' we need the points as well , because we want to remain in the top 10			0
' it is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year 's champions of @entity64			0
' if we are going to get anything there , we have to enjoy it and really play as a team and work as a team			0
' @entity0 celebrates with left back @entity71 after his goal against @entity25 at @entity27 last saturday @entity73 ( right ) scores @entity75 's second goal as @entity3 fell to another @entity8 defeat @entity0 added : ' a team like @entity3 ca n't afford to make mistakes , so for us it 's a good time to face them , but we must n't underestimate them , there 's life in them yet			1
' @entity1 look short of options in attack			2
striker @entity88 is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against @entity25 , while @entity92 , who has netted 12 goals in all competitions , is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain			0
@entity38 is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses			2
he said : ' that leaves us very short on the front line with @entity105 ( @entity106 ) being out , and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be , so if we do n't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us			0

@entity0 *believes* the @entity1 must not underestimate @entity3
