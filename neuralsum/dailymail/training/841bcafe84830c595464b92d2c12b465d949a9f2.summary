by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 12 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:45 est , 12 february 2014 a wine expert has blasted the @entity4 for serving ' cheap ' vintages that cost about $ 50 or less at tuesday 's state dinner for the @entity8 president			1
it comes as little surprise that the wines served at the gala were all from @entity14 vineyards , but wine blogger and @entity17 professor @entity16 criticized the choices for being driven by the budget at opposed to the quality of the wine			1
' the @entity22 @entity4 seems to have made a conscious choice to bring down the price of the wines			2
this is unfortunate : given the @entity4 policy of only serving @entity14 wines , they really should showcase the best of what @entity14 is making , irrespective of price , ' mr @entity16 wrote on his blog , dr vino			2
' the wine in question included a 2011 white @entity59 ' from @entity60 , a @entity62 red blend from @entity63 and a @entity65 dessert chardonnay from @entity66 , @entity67			0
the @entity60 white retails between $ 45 and $ 60 per bottle , the red blend averages around $ 50 and the dessert wine comes in as the cheapest at $ 30			1
one explanation for the price - conscious selections is that the @entity22 administration has been criticized for going the other direction in the past			0
whining over wine : the selections included a 2011 white @entity79 ' @entity59 ' from @entity60 ( left ) , a @entity62 red blend from @entity63 ( center ) and a @entity65 dessert chardonnay from @entity66 , @entity67 ( right ) filled with symbolism : the food and wine selections were chosen for purposeful reasons , like salad and honey from the @entity4 garden and vineyards from @entity8 - born winemakers first course : @entity14 @entity92 and @entity93 © , @entity94 , @entity95 second course : a winter garden salad with mixed radishes , baby carrots and lettuce topped with a red wine vinaigrette @entity101 : dry - aged rib eye beef with blue cheese from @entity104 and charred shallots , oysters , mushrooms and chard dessert : @entity112 chocolate malted ganache with vanilla ice cream and tangerines at the state dinner held for @entity117 president @entity116 in january 2011 , the @entity4 selected a @entity63 cabernet sauvignon that sold for $ 115 - per - bottle ( though some reports say that the price shot up to $ 399 at the time of the dinner )			1
after the blowback , the @entity4 opted not to list the wine that was paired with the meal when @entity128 prime minister @entity127 came to @entity14 in march 2012			2
on top of being price conscious , the @entity4 decision makers tried to make sure that there were symbolic connections that explained their selections , as the winemakers at both the @entity137 and the @entity139 vineyards grew up in @entity8			0
cheers : wine critic and professor @entity16 ( right ) said that the @entity4 based their selections on politics rather than prestige of the wine itself , which he argued should be important when serving the @entity8 the @entity67 wine was a nod to president @entity22 and president @entity40 's day trip to president @entity152 's estate at @entity66 on monday			1
@entity152 was the @entity14 ambassador to @entity8 before taking over the @entity4			0
mr @entity16 , however , felt that the @entity8 connections were ' modest at best '			0
' these formal occasions seem guided more by politics or the lack of curiosity of the @entity158 , ' he wrote on @entity159 .			0

wine professor @entity16 said that the @entity4 opted for reasonably - priced wines instead of showing the best vintages
all of the wine served at tuesday 's state dinner retail for around $ 50 or less per bottle
