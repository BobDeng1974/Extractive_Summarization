when the most decorated @entity2 footballer in history makes a beeline for you to praise your side ’s performance , you are generally on to a good thing			0
@entity8 was delighted to be congratulated by @entity9 after @entity10 extended their best ever start to a top - flight season by inflicting another defeat on struggling @entity12			1
‘ @entity9 came to me after the game and said , “ what a good team you have ”			0
that ’s a big compliment from a great player and it ’s very important , ’ said @entity8			0
subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
booked : @entity32 , @entity34 goals : long 75 and 80 manager : @entity8 7 @entity12 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity49 6 ; @entity50 5 ( @entity51 53 5.5 ) , @entity52 6 , @entity34 5 , @entity53 6 ; @entity9 5 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 5 , @entity56 6 ; @entity57 7 , @entity58 5.5 ( @entity59 70 , 6 ) subs : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity51 , @entity52 manager : @entity66 6 @entity67 : long referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) it is not just internationals with 23 titles impressed by @entity10			1
there is a dizzy whirl of people hankering to heap success on @entity10 and for good reason			1
not only are they second in the table , just four points behind @entity82 , but they again extended the best defensive record in the top four			0
the stakes have been raised at @entity10			1
that much was clear as groans became louder and more guttural as the home side dominated @entity12 but failed to find a breakthrough for more than an hour			0
it required substitute @entity20 to break the deadlock with his debut league goals for the club			1
the @entity95 striker came off the bench after 68 largely uninspiring minutes and nabbed his first seven minutes later , before sealing all three points on 80 minutes			2
‘ we had to be patient , ’ said @entity8 , ‘ it was difficult against a team with good organisation in defence and we lacked attention in the box and a final pass in the first half			2
but i said at half time , “ keep pressing and we will create , for sure we will score one or two times ”			2
’ he was full of praise for @entity20 , who had been dropped to make way for @entity39 after starting last week ’s victory at his former club @entity112			1
‘ it was great coming in from @entity20 , he made all the difference			1
sometimes @entity20 is not happy [ when he does not start ] , sometimes @entity39 is not , but i like that in a player			1
’ @entity20 made the breakthrough shortly after his introduction			1
fellow substitute @entity119 played in an arcing cross which was controlled by @entity40 , who set up @entity20 to expertly curl past @entity49 into the far corner			1
four minutes later the £ 12million signing , who has had a frustrating start to professional life on the south coast , added a second , finishing supremely after going one - on - one with @entity49			2
@entity8 looked drenched but delighted at the final whistle , flinging off the red blanket he had draped over his knees in an attempt to keep warm			0
it appears he might be building something truly special at @entity134 ’s and more importantly , something that lasts			2
this was the week @entity10 opened a £ 33m centre of excellence , named the @entity138 after the late @entity140 businessman who bought @entity10 out of administration in 2009			2
both teams hold a minutes silence before the match in a show of respect for @entity147 both teams were wearing a special emblazoned poppy that bears the caption ' 1914 - 2014 @entity151 ' @entity12 midfielder @entity9 ( left ) shields the ball away from the challenge of @entity39 @entity10 midfielder @entity35 ( top ) heads the ball clear during their @entity157 clash against @entity12 @entity40 ( left ) slides desperately to keep the ball in play at @entity134 's on saturday afternoon @entity34 ( left ) tries to pressurise @entity56 and win the ball back for @entity10 @entity161 ' ( centre right ) afternoon was cut short due to injury in the first half at @entity134 's @entity10 boss @entity8 ( left ) and his @entity12 counterpart @entity66 watch proceedings unfold at @entity134 's click here to see our brilliant @entity168 including the move for @entity20 's opener for @entity10 @entity172 miles @entity10 118.1 73.4 @entity34 90 12.2 7.6 @entity173 90 12.1 7.5 @entity35 90 11.5 7.1 @entity12 117.0 72.7 @entity54 90 12.4 7.7 @entity55 90 12.4 7.7 @entity9 90 11.4 7.1 the new training centre houses the ‘ black box ’ , a room where matches from around the world are played exhaustively on a giant video screen			1
sympathies have to be with the person forced to watch the first half of yesterday ’s game again			2
as the rain lashed down , @entity10 managed only one attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes , which was one better than the visitors			1
that effort came in the 21st minute and it was an ambitious one			2
@entity30 responded to the crowd urging and unleashed a shot from 25 yards , but @entity49 collected easily			0
moments later , @entity12 ’s @entity53 did well to head behind after a brilliant @entity33 cross			0
while the @entity195 remained steadfast they offered little going forward			0
a @entity197 header from a corner , which he directed high and wide , was their first real chance on 25 minutes			2
the second half heralded a more fluid @entity10			1
@entity40 fired over on 49 minutes from a @entity173 cross after he linked up with @entity39 superbly			1
the crowd were cheering when 22 - year - old @entity39 finished from close range shortly after but he was rightly ruled offside , guilty of mistiming his run			1
@entity20 popped up with his two and @entity12 ’s @entity59 was heavily mocked by the crowd after missing a plum opportunity for a consolation goal , prodding the ball to the right of the target when one - on - one with @entity29			1
long almost got his hat - trick with the final touch of the game but hit the side netting — not that he will be too bothered about that			0
@entity12 have now failed to score in their last five games and have collected just one point since their 5 - 3 win over @entity220			0
‘ it ’s a tough run for our players to deal with at the moment			0
it tests the resolve of everybody , ’ said manager @entity66			0
‘ you ’ve got to try to separate the psychological aspect of the players from how we play			0
unfortunately we did n’t show enough quality			0
‘ i do n’t accept the argument that it ’s a great achievement to be here and that ’s it			0
the combination of not keeping clean sheets and not scoring goals makes it very difficult			0
’ @entity39 ( centre ) thought he had put the @entity10 ahead in the second half but saw his strike disallowed @entity20 ( left ) broke the deadlock for @entity10 on 75 minutes curling home a left - footed shot inside the penalty area the @entity95 international ( second right ) is mobbed by his @entity10 team - mates after scoring their opener @entity59 ( left ) missed a glorious chance for @entity12 as they sought a consolation goal @entity20 ( left ) was close to completing his hat - trick late on , but saw his shot go narrowly wide of @entity49 's post			1

@entity20 broke the deadlock on 75 minutes with a low left - footed strike at @entity134 's
@entity20 *doubled* @entity10 's *advantage* five minutes later scoring a low right - footed effort
@entity39 thought he had given @entity10 the lead earlier in the second half but saw his goal disallowed
