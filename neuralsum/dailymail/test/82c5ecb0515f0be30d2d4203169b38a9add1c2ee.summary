@entity1 manager @entity0 declared that his players deserve to be in the @entity3 after a surprise victory against @entity5 moved them top of the @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s early own goal handed the @entity11 visitors a slim victory and threw the title race wide open with just two points separating the top four after last night ’s match			1
they could be overtaken on saturday when @entity17 , who relinquished first place , play their game in hand against @entity22 and @entity23 , the fourth team with a strong chance , host @entity26 this afternoon			1

goal : @entity9 8 ( @entity71 ) booked : @entity72 , @entity58 referee : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) attendance : 26,993 but @entity0 insisted : ‘ this last week for us has been amazing			2
we have won three games in six days , especially against @entity5 when everyone thought they would beat us			1
‘ i ’m proud of my players			0
once again they showed when they play their best they can beat everyone			0
i told them after the game if there is a team who deserve to be in @entity3 it ’s them			0
‘ the last game on may 2 we ’ll see which team will get promotion but i think it ’ ll go to the last second			0
’ @entity9 ’s mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end - of - season run - ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side			1
@entity0 admitted before the match that if his side lost they would have been cut too far adrift from the front runners , but all remains to play for now			0
the strong away contingent had settled easily in @entity5 ’s @entity105 entertainment park ahead of kick - off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch , in unfamiliar surroundings away from their @entity105 , in the opening exchanges			1
twenty minutes after the game had started and the home side had barely got out of their own half while @entity1 carved out chance after chance			1
one of those , in the ninth minute , produced the opener			0
@entity1 had lost back - to - back away matches - against promotion rivals @entity17 and @entity23 - for the first time this season before the match , so their lead was a surprise			1
so , too , was the look on @entity5 goalkeeper @entity33 ’s face when @entity56 sent in a corner from the left and his own midfielder @entity9 headed the ball at the near post over him and into the far right of goal			1
four minutes in and full - back @entity52 burst on the overlap down the right to cross for @entity63 whose header was deflected wide			2
two minutes later @entity27 , again on their right flank , feinted a cross and turned back on himself before playing the ball to @entity61			2
his flick - on found @entity63 again and his half - volley arrowed towards the top right corner but went just over			2
‘ the first 15 minutes cost us the game , ’ @entity5 manager @entity147 admitted			1
‘ after that , we did n’t do enough to win the game			2
at this stage of the season it is about making a difference and we did n’t do that			0
‘ in terms of effort and endeavour i could n't question them – they gave everything they had			0
it looks more likely that we are going to be involved in the play - offs so what we need to do now is dust ourselves off			2
’ @entity5 midfielder @entity43 ( left ) tries to run past @entity1 's @entity56 during friday 's encounter @entity59 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity43 during the @entity7 clash at @entity11 @entity5 striker @entity45 ( left ) failed to add to his impressive goal tally during the match for the hosts tempers flared in the dying embers of the match as both sets of players got to grips with one another @entity1 continued to dominate but with @entity5 ’s first chance of the game on 20 minutes they really should have been level			1
the foray forward saw @entity41 head a ball into the box back across goal and @entity38 had a free header six yards out but failed to find the target			0
it was , however , the catalyst for the home side to get a foothold in the game and their pressure mounted from then on until the final whistle went after seven minutes of stoppage time			0
a fierce intensity gripped proceedings with the home side unable to capitalise on their growing possession			0
the sold - out stadium roared their team on and they even threw @entity33 up at the end for a series of corners			0
it peaked in the final few moments when , from one of those corners , @entity1 defender @entity54 threw himself in front of @entity35 ’s volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal			1
that block could be worth millions			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 gives instructions to his team as they try to hold on to their lead			2

@entity5 midfielder @entity32 scored an own goal on eight minutes
win for @entity1 moves them ahead of @entity17 with *84* points
defeat drops @entity5 into fourth - two points behind with two games left
