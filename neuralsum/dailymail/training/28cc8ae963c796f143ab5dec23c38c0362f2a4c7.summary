@entity1 's ageing nuclear submarines have been issued with ‘ @entity3 ’ safety warnings after inspectors found radioactive leaks and a chronic shortage of @entity8 engineers trained to repair faulty reactors , @entity10 can reveal			1
an official watchdog discovered major safety issues with both the @entity1 ’s nuclear - powered submarines and facilities used to repair nuclear missiles , raising the risk of a catastrophic accident involving radioactive material			1
last night , experts described the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) report for 2012 - 13 as the most worrying they had seen			1
@entity3 : @entity22 , the oldest submarine in the @entity8 fleet , which entered service in 1984 , suffered damage to its circuits earlier this year resulting in a radioactive leak the document , obtained by this newspaper , reveals : head of the @entity20 dr @entity32 wrote : ‘ significant and sustained attention is required to ensure maintenance of adequate safety performance and the rating [ @entity37 ] reflects the potential impact if changes are ill - conceived or implemented			1
‘ the inability to sustain a sufficient number of nuclear suitably competent personnel is the principal threat to safety			2
vulnerabilities exist in core skill areas , including safety , propulsion , power and naval architects			0
in march 2007 , sailors @entity53 , 20 , ( right ) and @entity54 , 32 , ( left ) were killed on @entity55 when a self - contained oxygen generator exploded during an @entity58 exercise north of @entity59			0
they died trapped in a small , smoke - filled compartment			0
an inquest heard that there was a significant possibility the generator was salvaged from a hazardous waste depot in a cost - cutting bid by the @entity67 ‘ due to build delays with the @entity70 , there has been a requirement to extend the @entity72 beyond their original design life in order to maintain the @entity75 at a fully operational level			2
some of the emergent technical issues affecting the @entity72 over the last few years can be directly attributed to the effects of plant ageing			2
’ the report also raises concerns over whether the @entity1 ’s nuclear fleet and its inland nuclear establishments could withstand an earthquake on the same scale as the one that struck the @entity89 reactor plant in @entity90 in 2011			1
the document notes that facilities which form part of @entity1 ’s @entity94 ( @entity94 ) require ‘ continued priority attention ’ to reach recommended safety standards			1
last night , nuclear expert @entity98 told @entity10 that the @entity20 report revealed a crisis in @entity8 nuclear safety			1
he said : ‘ this is the most self - damning and concerning report that i have seen			2
we ’re talking about a ticking time - bomb , with a higher risk to the public and the environment than we previously feared			0
‘ the combination of a lack of nuclear engineers , the @entity109 submarines being so far behind schedule and the @entity72 sailing beyond their design date is very worrying			1
' the @entity116 , including @entity55 , the oldest boat of the class , should be withdrawn immediately			2
’ @entity55 , which entered service in 1984 , suffered damage to its circuits earlier this year resulting in a radioactive leak			0
the nuclear sub was patrolling off @entity124 when the problem arose , forcing its captain to return to @entity127			0
a more serious leak was avoided because of swift remedial action			0
nuclear materials – including @entity132 missiles – are brought to the @entity134 ’s site at @entity135 , @entity136 , for assembly , maintenance and decommissioning			1
warning : there are also fears over the @entity135 centre where @entity132 missiles are serviced these processes include ‘ uranium polishing ’ – the removal of impurities from the material in order to extend its life cycle as a component in nuclear missiles			0
the @entity20 report states : ‘ inspection programmes have not been as comprehensive as regulators would expect			0
as an example , corrosion in the structural supports of a building was not identified as early as would be expected which resulted in the @entity160 issuing a @entity161			0
’ last night the @entity134 admitted corrosion had affected its uranium component manufacturing facility , but added repairs had been completed			2
an @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ we would not operate any submarine unless it was safe to do so and this report acknowledges that we are taking the necessary action to effectively manage the technical issues raised by the regulator			0
‘ it also highlights that the @entity67 is committed to maintaining expertise in submarine technology and operation – underlined by last month ’s operational handover of the first two @entity70 submarines			1

safety issues with @entity1 's nuclear subs and facilities used to repair missiles
**cracks** in reactors and nuclear discharges found in @entity8 ’s oldest boats
nuclear - **qualified** engineers are **quitting** over poor **pay** and conditions
experts described latest report as the most worrying they had seen
**cracks** in reactors and nuclear discharges are directly attributable to the @entity8 ’s oldest @entity196 ( @entity197 ) remaining in service beyond their design date .
faults with the new @entity70 submarines will delay their entry into service , forcing the @entity8 to continue sailing the ageing and potentially dangerous @entity116 .
the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) failed to notice or rectify corrosion to a nuclear missile treatment plant in @entity136 .
nuclear - **qualified** engineers are **quitting** the @entity8 in *droves* over poor **pay** and conditions , *creating* a skills crisis .
