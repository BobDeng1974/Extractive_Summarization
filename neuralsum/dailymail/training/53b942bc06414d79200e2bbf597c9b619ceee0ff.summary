following the criticisms of a number of @entity4 brands for producing halal - certified versions of their products , a new target has come under fire			1
in a post to their @entity13 page on wednesday , one angry chocoholic vowed they would be boycotting @entity16 products simply because it is halal certified			1
' @entity21 , this is my chocolate purchase for the fortnight , traditionally it would all be @entity25 , as it has been for many many years , ' the consumer wrote alongside a picture of a large number of @entity29 blocks			2
one disgruntled customer has taken to social media claiming she will boycott @entity25 chocolate as it is halal ' but due to @entity25 being @entity35 , @entity34 will have my business from here on in			1
' when questioned over their decision by other social media users , the angry customer defended their position saying it was not racist , and it was a choice not to ' support any religion '			1
' it 's not racist , no @entity46 is a race , ' they wrote			0
' it 's about having things forced upon us , against our will			0
i want to be informed about what i buy			0
i do n't want to support any @entity53 , as i do n't believe in it			0
when quizzed by other customers about her strong stance , the woman defended her comments denying she was being intolerant some agreed with the comments saying they would also be boycotting the brand i should n't be forced to support it every time i purchase food , ' the comment ended			2
another used quizzed the decision asking how it was affecting the disgruntled customer personally - and the consumer hit back saying that @entity25 was being deliberately deceptive			2
' they 're greedy with no morals , and sly enough to hide the label , or not label it at all , so you do n't know what you 're buying ' , they wrote			0
some fellow chocolate lovers were appalled by the comments , with one woman saying ' chocolate is chocolate ! so stupid how people make such a big deal over things like this			0
some adults are worse than children ! ' the same critic claimed that the chocolate brand was being deliberately deceptive despite these claims the list of halal certified products is readily available on the @entity25 website others supported the decision to boycott the brand , with one user declaring ' @entity25 off my shopping list now too ! '			1
however some people decided to make light of the harsh comments , with one commenter saying he was ' boycotting vegetables as well			0
' ' ca n't stand those pesky vegans forcing me to eat stuff that 's got no meat in it just cos ( sic ) they do n't eat meat , ' he wrote			0
' it 's an outrage			0
' one commenter made light of the situation pointing out how ridiculous the comments were another also saw the funny side , claiming he was going to quit eating vegetables others found the situation amusing , saying people were making mountains out of molehills just last week iconic @entity4 brands such as @entity127 , @entity128 and even the humble @entity130 biscuit were under fierce attack on social media for producing @entity135 - friendly halal - certified versions of their products			1
the facebook page ' @entity139 in @entity4 ' has been set up and aims to ' boycott all companies and organisations that promote or use halal products and services			1
' the page has 20,000 followers who claim that they will ' not buy halal products & services , because they fund @entity135 expansion by any means '			1
@entity127 and the @entity150 's @entity130 biscuits are the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal certified range of foods			1
@entity128 and @entity155 have also come under social media attack for producing halal versions			1
the number of complaints about their new halal foods has increased in recent months			2
@entity127 has even been forced to respond individually to some of the @entity13 attacks			2
the @entity4 pie company has said : ' halal certified products are a small part of our range and are clearly labelled to ensure everyone can make an informed decision about which @entity127 product is right for them			1
' among the consumers declaring they will boycott the company , a few have voiced their support for their decision to introduce halal products			1
however , the overwhelming majority of @entity13 users have been attacking the company 's decision to sell halal products			1
one @entity197 user posted : ' i believe your company has bowed to @entity135 pressure and now pay for your products to be halal certified ... is this correct ? if so , i will not be buying any of your companies products ever again ! ' @entity150 's @entity130 biscuits is the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal range @entity155 consumers take to the official @entity13 page to post against the halal certified products , while @entity155 has even taken to responding to some comments another wrote : ' you say less than 5 % of your products are halal certified			1
. so does that make it ok that you 're selling out to @entity135 crap rot			0
. you are still supporting it an the cruelty to animals			0
. you have lost another customer an i will be letting all know what you have done ... not on ...			0
' one angry buyer even said the family would stop buying @entity127 because it was selling halal certified products			1
the @entity230 and @entity231 are certified halal by the @entity233			2
the attacks on the @entity127 halal range come despite the fact they are only being sold at specialty stores and produced for export			2
@entity241 has contacted @entity127 for comment			2
meanwhile , the @entity243 reports the @entity150 is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official @entity13 page to attack them for their halal @entity130 biscuit range			1
one @entity13 user posted ' what a disgrace , the thousands of @entity250 that died on the beaches at @entity253 will be turning in their graves			2
' another posted : ' no @entity260 anything for me either			0
i stand firm on boycotting anything @entity263			0
no food should be about religion			0
no law should be about religion			0
' disappointed consumers have expressed their anger over the halal certified range of @entity160 foods @entity150 is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official @entity13 page to post their disappointment over the company 's halal @entity130 biscuits facebook users have even accused @entity160 of supporting terrorism because they have launched a halal range of products a spokesman from the @entity285 told @entity241 that many @entity4 food manufacturers seek halal certification so their products can be enjoyed by @entity290 and @entity291			1
' in the same way that food labelled as vegan or gluten - free is suitable for consumption by a broad range of consumers , halal certified foods are commonly enjoyed by non-muslims , ' he said			1
' manufacturers pay for certification as a professional service , much like kosher or organic accreditation , for example			0
' organisations who offer @entity263 certification services are subject to the same prohibitions on funding illegal entities and activity as any other organisation or individual under @entity4 law			2
' even @entity128 has come under attack for stocking halal certified products despite the negative complaints , many customers have expressed their support for the range on @entity127 's @entity13 page : one user posted : ' going to have a pie party with my next pay check			1
what a bunch of legends ! ' another one wrote : ' good onya @entity160 , for ignoring the ignorant bigots			0

you 're awesome ' and another wrote : ' it makes sense to have your pies certified halal , same as you would have them certified " kosher " or " @entity340 " or " @entity341 "			2
@entity4 need to know what they 're eating			0
as long as your pies are still delicious , you have my support			0
' despite the negative complaints , many others are showing their support for the halal certified @entity4 meat pies one user stood up for the range , and said ' boycott and you 're the ones who 'll miss out on a good ol ' @entity4 pie ' another user wrote : ' thank you for being a great @entity4 company ! i love your pies ...
