excited : @entity7 ca n't wait to spend her first @entity5 at home with her family she underwent eight rounds of chemotherapy at @entity37 to treat a primary tumour in her chest and ten tumours that had spread throughout her body and to her skull			1

she 's been in and out of hospital every month since she was diagnosed			0

we were fearing the worst			0
' @entity7 , 2 , pictured here during treatment , has had eight rounds of chemotherapy to rid her body of tumours ' she finished chemotherapy treatment in february and she had another infection after that but it has settled down since then			1
