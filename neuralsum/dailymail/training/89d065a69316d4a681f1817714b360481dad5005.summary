for anyone who 's ever driven in a large city , red lights quickly become a massive annoyance			2
however , @entity4 is developing a system that could spell the end of red lights for drivers			1
it is testing a system known as ' @entity11 ' that shows drivers exactly how far away their next red is - helping they time their drive to minimise stopping			1
@entity4 's latest feature will tell drivers when traffic lights are about to change - and warn if you 're about to run a red light			1
information from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and shown on the dashboard - or eventually on a heads up display			2
when combined with the motion sensors and speed information from the car , drivers can be told exactly how to avoid stopping at red lights			1
it shows the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase			2
acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red lights			0
the display , in the dashboard in front of drivers , shows a traffic light icon with a countdown timer that reads the number of seconds before a light changes from red to green			2
the system , is linked into a city 's electronic traffic light network , and can even take into account lane changes			0
local data from city councils who install smart traffic lights , and motion sensors in the car are used to to predict exactly how long it 'll be until the green light goes red			1
@entity4 has been testing the new technology in @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60 , as well as in @entity61 , @entity62 , and also set it up in @entity63 for the @entity65 show			0
in the traffic light phase assistant project in @entity68 , 20 traffic light systems in the vicinity of @entity68 am @entity70 were retrofitted so that the test fleet could communicate with them			0
@entity4 also showed off their new sport quattro concept car during the @entity4 keynote at the @entity65 , which features laser headlights ' the goal of developers was to achieve the most efficient flow of traffic in metropolitan areas , ' said @entity4			1
' information from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and visualized as graphic images on the driver information system display			1
' they show the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase			0
acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red phases			0
' @entity4 claims the traffic light info online enables @entity98 reductions of up to 15 percent			0
how the system could work : @entity4 says it hopes smart cruise control could be integrated so automatically set the car 's speed ' in sum , this would be equivalent to about 900 million liters ( 237.75 million @entity108 gallons ) of fuel per year , if this technology were to be implemented throughout @entity60 , ' it claims			1
over the course of the six - month test phase , a total of 500 test drivers in 120 cars and three motorcycles covered a total of 1.65 million kilometers ( 1.03 million miles )			0
the vehicles were networked with one another via specially developed radio transmission equipment and via a traffic control center to inform drivers of traffic conditions and hazards .			0

@entity4 concept car is able to communicate with city traffic lights to find out when they will turn red
can alert driver how *faraway* their next red is , and how long it will take to get there - and the speed to drive at so they do *n't* have to stop
system requires cities to install smart traffic lights
can even alert drivers if they are at risk of running a red light
