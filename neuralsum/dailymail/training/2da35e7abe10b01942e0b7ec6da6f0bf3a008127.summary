by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:39 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 07:59 est , 9 january 2014 controversial plans to attract wealthy investors would amount to letting them buy a @entity7 passport , critics claim foreign millionaires will be able to ‘ buy ’ visas to live in @entity7 under radical plans drawn up by government advisers			1
@entity12 suggests people who give money to schools , universities or hospitals should be ‘ let in ’ to the @entity7			1
it also proposes holding auctions for visas to be sold to the highest overseas bidder , but mps warn the plan would bring ‘ no benefit to the citizens of this country ’			1
the plan is likely to prove highly controversial , because the @entity27 has previously opposed plans by other @entity30 countries to effectively sell citizenship which would give them the right to settle in @entity7			1
professor sir @entity34 , chairman of the @entity12 , told mps that @entity7 had to examine new ways to attract wealthy investors to the country			1
he said : ‘ it may very well be that we should be auctioning some of these slots / ‘ there should be proper discussion about it			1
equally it may very well be that we should be letting people in if they endow a @entity47 college , a major teaching hospital or the @entity49 with £ 10 million			2
’ the committee has been asked to examine the issue by home secretary @entity52 , and is expected to submit a report in february			2
but giving evidence to the @entity56 , sir @entity34 set out how an auction might work			1
one option would see wealthy foreigners making investments of £ 1million , £ 5million or £ 10million in government bonds or @entity7 businesses			2
in return , the investor would be able to apply to stay in the @entity7 for two , three or five years and after that could apply for @entity7 citizenship			2
the gilts could later be sold , meaning the money is effectively a loan and not a long - term investment			1
sir @entity34 said the country did not ‘ need ’ the money			2
‘ sometimes they borrow the money and then they keep the gilts for five years			2
they get indefinite leave to remain , and then they sell them			0
we do not need their money			0
’ @entity84 mp @entity83 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said the proposal had triggered real concern among mps but @entity84 mp @entity83 , chairman of the @entity56 , was alarmed by the idea and suggested the plan would allow people to obtain a @entity94 passport without benefiting the country			1
he told @entity96 : ‘ ‘ what was very clear from @entity34 and what causes us concern is that this is not a way of getting money into @entity7 to produce more jobs and ensure the economy benefits , ’ he said			0
‘ this is a way in which those who have money available to buy gilts , get citizenship and then sell them at personal gain			0
there is no benefit to the citizens of this country			0
‘ the whole area around the investor route towards citizenship needs to be examined			0
we need to have a better way			0
at the moment the route ensures benefits to individuals but not society as a whole			0
’ sir @entity126 , chairman of @entity127 , said : ‘ it would be absurd if this route was allowed to become a means of selling @entity7 passports			0
’ @entity132 sparked controversy when it announced plans to sell passports for half a million pounds			0
the policy will allow the super-rich from countries like @entity138 and @entity139 to effectively buy the right to live and work anywhere in the @entity30			0
the @entity27 warned at the time that it would not tolerate ‘ abuse ’ of free movement rules across the @entity30 and is working to prevent people using loopholes to enter the @entity7 .			1

@entity12 reveals controversial plan to mps
visas could be sold at auction or given to *donors* to universities
proposal will be presented to the @entity27 next month
