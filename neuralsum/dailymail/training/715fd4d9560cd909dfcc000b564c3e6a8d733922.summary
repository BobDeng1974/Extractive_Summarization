@entity1 winger @entity0 was damned as an unreliable witness by an @entity3 on tuesday after they threw out his appeal against a seven - match ban for racial abuse			1
a @entity8 chaired by senior judge @entity9 found the @entity10 guilty of calling @entity12 defender @entity11 a ‘ black c * * * ’ and ruled there was no reason to overturn the initial verdict			1
although @entity1 insist they will stand by @entity0 and press for changes to a disciplinary system that relies on the balance of probabilities , the @entity17 behind both judgements - published on the recommendation of @entity9 - left @entity0 ’s reputation badly damaged			0
@entity0 ( near ) was deemed an unreliable witness by the @entity3 the @entity1 winger lost his appeal against a seven - match ban for racial abuse the 24 - year - old , who refused the offer of a translator during both hearings , was found to have delivered an ‘ inherently improbable account ’ of the verbal exchange he had with @entity11 during the @entity1 - @entity12 game in @entity39 on september 13			1
and the official report declared : ‘ on the central issue in the case we were unable to accept him as either credible or reliable			2
‘ we found on the balance of probabilities that mr @entity0 did say to mr @entity11 “ do n’t touch me you black c * * * ”			1
’ @entity1 ’s counsel argued that @entity11 could have misheard @entity0 , something the @entity50 defender denied ‘ one thousand per cent ’ – and also insisted that the burden of proof should be higher for such a serious accusation			1
@entity0 is alleged to have called @entity12 defender @entity11 ( pictured ) a ' black c * * * ' @entity1 have insisted they will stand by @entity0 who does protest his innocence @entity1 ’s response also attacked a system that as , @entity0 ’s lawyer described it , pits ‘ one player ’s word against the other ’			1
a club statement declared : ‘ @entity1 is extremely disappointed by the outcome of the @entity66 ’s @entity65			2
‘ we do not consider that any player should be found guilty of such a grave offence on the basis of the evidence presented in this case			0
@entity1 will be approaching the @entity74 fa to seek to address this issue			0
‘ we would like to make it clear that at no stage was it ever suggested that @entity11 had made any false allegations			2
however , @entity0 ’s position consistently has been that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist			0
@entity1 's counsel argued that @entity11 could have misheard @entity0 , something that the @entity12 man denies @entity85 is currently on loan from @entity88 side @entity87 ‘ @entity1 has enjoyed an excellent relationship with @entity12 and this , of course , will continue			1
‘ as we have said many times before , racism has no place in football and as a club which has been open to all ever since its formation in 1888 , @entity1 abhors racism of any kind			0
clearly , @entity0 continues to have our full support			0
’ @entity1 also have the option , if they wish , of taking the @entity0 case to the @entity103			0
the on - loan @entity87 winger ’s ban will begin immediately , although he has already served one match of the suspension , meaning he will be back in time for @entity109 away on january 24			0

@entity0 was banned for seven matches for allegedly calling @entity12 defender @entity11 a ‘ black c * * * ’
@entity0 's appeal against the ban was thrown out by an @entity66 @entity3
the *panel* was ' unable to accept ' @entity0 as ' either credible or reliable '
