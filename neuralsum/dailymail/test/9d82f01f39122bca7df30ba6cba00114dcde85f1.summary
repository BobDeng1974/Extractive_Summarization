@entity0 has released incredible point - of - view footage taken by astronauts on spacewalks of the @entity4			2
expedition 42 commander @entity5 and flight engineer @entity6 recorded three spacewalks , known as @entity8 , on @entity10 cameras outside the @entity4 on february 25 and march 1			1
the spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of multibillion pound commercial spacecraft , which @entity0 hope will be in operation by 2017			1
expedition 42 commander @entity5 and flight engineer @entity6 recorded three spacewalks on @entity19 cameras @entity0 recently signed a contract with commercial spaceflight companies @entity21 and @entity23 with the intention to produce craft capable of transporting astronauts to the @entity4 the clip was recorded to give the future @entity4 workers an idea of what they can expect when they go into space to maintain the commercial spacecraft			1
in the footage @entity6 and @entity5 can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system for the future docking spacecraft			1
the spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of 2017 's multibillion pound commercial spacecraft the astronauts can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system construction of the @entity4 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			2
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity58 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
the two men also set up antennas and routed 4000 feet ( 1219m ) of power and data cables			0
the video captures breathtakingly clear images of earth as astronauts work from a distance of 250 miles			1
@entity0 has recently relied on @entity70 @entity69 capsules taking astronauts to @entity4 to carry out maintenance work since its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011 after 30 years ’ service			2
but at a cost of nearly £ 50 million per seat , it has not been a financially viable solution			0
@entity0 now hope that their deals with @entity21 and @entity23 can cut the cost of their future transportation fees			0
the @entity4 is a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit			0
it is now the largest artificial body in orbit , since its first component was launched in 1998 , and is often visible to the naked eye from earth			0
