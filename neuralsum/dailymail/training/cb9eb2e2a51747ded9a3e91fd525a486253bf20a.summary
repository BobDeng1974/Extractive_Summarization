by @entity0 claims : the @entity3 opposition leader @entity2 has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country 's sophisticated radar system the @entity3 opposition leader has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country 's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information			1
politician @entity2 said that when he was the @entity3 finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar , and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course			1
the 66 - year - old also suggested it was possible that the @entity3 authorities had colluded in the fate of flight mh370 , and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft			1
he said that the integrity of the entire country was in jeopardy , and added that the families of the 153 @entity28 passengers who were on board the @entity31 @entity30 were correct to seek more information from the @entity3 government			1
the aircraft was carrying 239 passengers and crew on a flight from @entity37 to @entity38 when it vanished on march 8			1
mr @entity2 , who has admitted he was related to the plane 's pilot @entity39 via an in - law , said the @entity43 radar system , which covers the @entity3 mainland , including its east and west coastlines from its base in the @entity47 , was approved by him in 1994			1
he said the radar would have instantly noticed when the plane turned west away from its planned route , and said he could not understand why radar operators were unable to check on the plane 's journey			2
mr @entity2 also questioned why the @entity3 air force had not gone after the plane , and said had concerns over the way the hunt for the plane had been carried out in the days after it vanished			1
' i believe the government knows more than us			0
they have the authority to instruct the air force … or @entity31 , ' he told @entity64			2
a @entity67 @entity66 crew member looks out for debris from the @entity31 plane mission : search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the @entity73 , around 1,100 miles north of @entity74 , @entity75 location : mr @entity2 said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the @entity47 as they would have known the plane was not there ' they are privy to most of these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this mysterious disappearance of @entity87			1
' he said he was unable to comment on a suggestion that the @entity3 authorities knew what had happened to the plane , or whether a terrorist act had been responsible for its disappearance			0
but he said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the @entity47 as they would have known the plane was not there			2
fading hopes : no trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it vanished , and hopes of locating the plane 's data recorders before the batteries fail are slim search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the @entity73 , around 1,100 miles north of @entity74 ,			2
no trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it vanished , and although there is no timeframe for ending the search , hopes of locating the plane 's data recorders before the batteries fail are slim			0
finding the data recorders , often called the black box , would provide a wealth of information about the condition the plane was flying under and the communications or sounds in the cockpit			0
official : @entity121 , the director general of @entity3 's @entity122 is seen giving a press conference after briefing @entity28 relatives on the progress of the investigation desperation : mr @entity2 said families of the 153 @entity28 passengers who were on board the @entity31 @entity30 were correct to seek more information from the @entity3 government false hope : one government source said authorities could not provide families with information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the investigation the data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by special equipment in the immediate vicinity			1
but the battery - powered devices stop transmitting the pings about 30 days after a crash			0
locating the data recorders and wreckage after that is possible , but becomes an even more daunting task			0
mr @entity2 described the @entity3 government 's efforts as ' at the least , incompetence , but claimed there was an ' intention to suppress key information '			1
opposition : mr @entity2 was once @entity3 's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties however , critics of mr @entity2 had said he is trying to exploit the tragedy for his own political purposes			2
one government source said authorities could not provide families with information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the investigation as well as giving them false hope			1
@entity3 authorities have not commented on mr @entity2 ’s accusations , but previously the country 's sports minister @entity171 said he had spoken of pilot captain @entity39 's support for his party so he could ' play the victim '			0
denial : some reports suggested captain @entity39 ( pictured ) may have hijacked the plane , although both his family and mr @entity181 have rejected the claims mr @entity2 was once @entity3 's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties			1
in the country 's election last year they won more than 50 per cent of the popular vote , but lost the election - prompting allegations of corruption			0
the day before the jetliner went missing , @entity2 was sentenced to five years in jail for a second sodomy offense , preventing him from running in a by - election later this month			1
his prosecution on a charge of sodomy is seen by many @entity3 as political persecution			0
campaigners say the politician , the key challenger to @entity3 ’s ruling party , was the victim of a long - running smear campaign and had faced trumped - up charges			0
captain @entity39 , a supporter of the pro-democracy coalition , was thought to be incensed by the verdict			0
some reports suggested captain @entity39 may have hijacked the plane , although both his family and mr @entity181 have rejected the claims			0
mr @entity181 said that had the pilot been involved in the aircraft 's disappearance , he would have been unable to hide radar readings			0
he said : ' to condemn a person because he is a supporter of democracy is totally unjustified			0
having said that , there ’s nothing stopping the police or the authorities from conducting an open and fair investigation into anybody – including the radar operators , the defence minister – why are they concealing this information ? '			2
