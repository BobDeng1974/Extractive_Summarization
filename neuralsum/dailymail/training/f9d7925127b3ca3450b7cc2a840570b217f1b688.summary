a study has revealed that people who regularly eat sushi could be at an increased risk of heart disease they say the fish contains methylmercury which can cause heart disease , problems with brain and nervous system development and decreased cognitive performance			1
the researchers , who published their findings in the @entity33 , also noted that methylmercury can counteract the positive effects of omega - 3 fatty acids			1
