workers inside the houses of @entity2 are being subjected to overflowing and blocked toilets , rodent infestations and leaking roofs according to a new documentary to be broadcast next month			1
the 160 - year - old building requires an immediate refurbishment costing in excess of £ 1 billion before irreparable damage is done to the historic structure			1
a decision saving the structure will not be made until after the election so it does not become an issue at the forthcoming poll			2
the houses of @entity2 , pictured , require immediate work to prevent them suffering irreparable damage a four - part documentary on @entity19 has been granted exclusive access behind the scenes of the @entity22			1
@entity23 , who made the documentary , told the @entity25 : ' the place is nearly falling down			0
it is probably the biggest building project in @entity29			0
we saw leaking roofs ; we saw paintwork and plaster work crumbling			1
we saw buckets to catch the drips			0
even the stonework on @entity37 [ the home of @entity37 ] is crumbling			2
' the building has also seen infestations of mice , rats , moths and even pigeons			0
@entity45 mp @entity44 said that two members of her staff were forced to go home sick after a pipe burst in april 2013			1
the leaking sewerage built up near her office , making two of her staff ill. it is understood repairs took two weeks to complete despite the threat to health and safety			1
she told @entity59 : ' i had rung facilities and it had been dealt with immediately two members of my staff would not have been sick and there would not have been faeces all over the floor			2
i had to ring the serjeant at arms and he dealt with it , not facilities			0
' flaking and rusting iron roofs have caused major problems with leaks and require replacing flaking and rusting iron roofs have caused major problems with leaks and require replacing , a major study into the state of @entity2 found some roof supports have rusted so badly they have been at risk of collapse before replacing the historic building on the banks of the @entity85 is so dilapidated that major repairs are needed or irreversible damage may be done and ‘ part of our nation ’s most valued heritage will be lost forever ’ , a cross-party report has warned			1
here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the @entity22 to prevent a ‘ looming crisis ’ : asbestos the walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the @entity22 at risk			1
@entity102 much of the building needs re-wiring , and generators do not produce enough power @entity107 many original shafts are filled with wires , and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable			0
heating many boilers date from the 1930s , pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the @entity120 chamber for months flooding faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding , and the @entity37 belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration			0
walls are damp and stained			0
@entity129 @entity128 a problem throughout the @entity22 , particularly as cast - iron roofs are coming to the end of their life			1
@entity134 several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity138 every year , while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the @entity142 chamber drainage pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected			1
fire safety out of date alarms and automatic detection systems ; little ‘ compartmentation ’ meaning fire can spread easily			0
lifts oldest lift dates from 1893 , several contain obsolete components			0
only nine compliant with building regulations			0
officials admit that there has been ‘ significant under - investment ’ since the 1940s , when the @entity120 was bombed by the @entity159			2
for years contractors have adopted a ' make do and mend ' approach to repairs , while the @entity120 and @entity142 have continued to meet			1
however , experts warn the building is deteriorating at a faster pace than repairs can be carried out during parliamentary holidays			0
dr @entity169 , programme director for the @entity170 , said : ‘ there is very little downtime and the problem is how on earth you undertake fundamental renovations on the scale required under those circumstances			0
‘ the more things become antiquated the chances of a bigger crisis grow			0
it ’s already burned down once , ’ he told @entity179			0
@entity183 , parliamentary director of estates and technical director for the programme , added : ‘ within six months of my joining i had a member stuck in a lift as a vote was underway			0
' the legislation was ultimately passed by seven votes			0
that brought home just how serious these issues are			2
’ many of the 3,000 windows will not close , iron roofs have rusted and leak , toilets regularly flood and the building is riddled with asbestos , in roof spaces , light switches , toilet systems and as a sound suppressant			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ there has been significant under - investment in the fabric of the @entity22 since at least the 1940s , when parts of the @entity22 were renovated following bomb damage during the @entity212			1
other parts of the @entity22 have not undergone appropriate renovation since it was built			1
‘ to date , all intrusive renovation work has been carried out around sittings of parliament			1
this approach has permitted only the minimum essential maintenance and piecemeal replacement of systems at highest risk of failure			2
‘ currently , the rate and speed at which work can be carried out is slower than the rate at which the building is deteriorating so the backlog of essential repairs ( and in turn the risk of system failure ) is growing over time			1
’ brick work is also crumbling , because the @entity235 from @entity236 is prone to erosion many parts of the houses of @entity2 have not been repaired since they were built , more than 160 years ago @entity240 in the grand corridors inside the building is also peeling , and in many areas has been damaged by water a report two years ago found the @entity247 structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing			1
it warned that @entity253 and @entity142 will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics , heating , ventilation systems , drainage and stone work			1
they concluded that the @entity262 - which contains the @entity120 and lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms , offices and dining rooms - was so poorly - maintained that it is ‘ remarkable that it continues to function ’			2
and they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe , the @entity22 could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834 .			2

@entity45 mp @entity44 sent two staff home *due* to leaking raw sewage
