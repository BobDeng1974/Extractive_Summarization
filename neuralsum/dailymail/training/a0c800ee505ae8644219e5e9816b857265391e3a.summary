by @entity0 a teacher has managed to lose five and a half stone after her size caused a classroom chair to break beneath her - in front of an entire class of pupils			1
@entity9 , 23 , sat on the chair in front of her class , only to be mortified as it collapsed under her 17st weight			1
humiliated , @entity9 vowed to beat the bulge			1
she ditched her unhealthy lifestyle and now weighs in at just under 12st			0
@entity9 has dropped from 17st 3lbs and size 22 to 11st 10lbs and a size 12 ( right ) it was after breaking the chair in class that @entity9 decided it was time to take action about her size @entity9 said : ' when i felt the chair legs give way beneath me i was just so embarrassed			1
' as i lay in a heap on the floor i heard one of the pupils say that i was too fat for the chair			2
' the little boy was n’t being rude - he was only five - but it was the shock i needed to make me realise how big i was			2
' i picked myself up , trying to pretend like it was nothing , but it was just awful			0
' i left school that day determined to do something about my weight			1
' @entity9 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , had piled on the pounds since becoming a primary school teacher			1
@entity9 said : ' i ’ve always been a big girl , i come from an overweight family and my mum was always on diets			1
@entity9 , who has always struggled with her weight , found that it began to creep up when she started her job as a school teacher , but now she has shed the pounds she finds it much easier to keep up with the children ' it was normal for me to have seconds or thirds after dinner , and at high school i ’d always have sweets in my pocket			1
' but when i got my first job as a teacher i put on even more weight			1
' i ’d have pastries and sweets for breakfast , have pies as a snack on my way home from work and then eat tea too			2
' after eight months my trousers did n’t fit and i was wearing my baggiest blouses			0
@entity9 said that her determination to lose weight was in part because both her parents suffered health conditions which can be made worse by being overweight ' even my size 22 dress was getting tight			1
' it started to become difficult to sit down on the floor with the children , and run around after them			2
' i ’d dread teaching @entity82 because i did n’t have the energy to do it - it was a nightmare			2
' i was always out of breath			0
' breakfast : nothing lunch : fast food like @entity90 or @entity91 dinner : large portion of cottage pie or chicken curry , plus cake or ice cream snacks : many throughout the day breakfast : @entity100 shake lunch : chicken salad dinner : small portion of chicken and vegetables drink as much water as possible each day but after breaking the chair in class , @entity9 decided it was time to take action			1
@entity9 now has lots oif energy and can easily keep up with her class she joined the @entity100 in may 2013 and in just six months has gone from 17st 3lbs , to a svelte 11st 10lbs			1
she said : ' i ’d tried various diets in the past but nothing ever worked for me			0
' i ’d spent so much time and money on diets , but it did n’t matter			0
' i ’d go to meetings to get weighed but then i ’d head straight out the doors into the fish and chip shop			0
' but this time it was different - i was so determined that i would lose it			0
' it was hard at first but as the weight melted off i gained more energy and i loved the person i was becoming			2
' whenever i wanted to give up , i had to remember the health benefits			0
my dad had a heart attack and my mum has been diagnosed with high cholesterol - i did n’t want to go the same way as them			0
' i think even my family and friends found it hard to believe that i would do it this time , with people telling me i ’d never keep the weight off , but i was determined to prove myself			0
' i wear a size 12 now , and i ’m much more confident			1
' now , @entity9 has the energy to run around after her lively class of children			1
' now i can jump about in @entity82 , and put together fun and energetic lessons			0
' getting down on the floor to read to the children is no problem , and everything is so much easier			0
' i ’m so proud of myself for losing the weight , and it ’s taught me so much			2
