it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
what 's hot @entity5 on receiving a letter of complaint from a @entity10 supporter , @entity5 , the club 's manager , drove round to his house			1
@entity5 has guided @entity13 @entity12 to the semi-finals of the @entity15 later that year he received correspondence from another fan suggesting his 18 - year - old son could get in his team			1
@entity5 invited the lad to training and threw him a pair of boots			1
lovely tales , both , but they do more than suggest @entity27 has a flick of his old man about him			0
they tell you that @entity5 knows his mind and this is something evident in the way he selects his very best team for cup matches			1
hired last season to keep @entity12 in @entity13 , he did that but i would imagine his club 's fans will treasure the memory of the @entity43 semi-final that followed rather more			1
a year on and @entity5 's team have a sniff of @entity46 again			1
@entity12 's league form may suffer if they do make it to the @entity15 final but @entity5 will take the risk			1
football is supposed to be about guts and glory			0
nobody writes letters to football managers to thank them for finishing eighth do they ? @entity5 's @entity12 go into the second leg against @entity59 at @entity60 a goal down @entity62 the @entity64 quick @entity63 used to tell toiling batsman : ' you 've got some s * * t on the end of your bat '			1
on seeing the more gullible flip the bat over and examine the bottom , @entity63 would add : ' wrong end mate '			0
it was crude but it was funny			0
what was only one of these things was @entity80 's welcome to @entity81 when the @entity82 arrived at the crease in @entity84 last winter			2
' get ready for a broken f * * * * * g arm , ' grunted the @entity64 captain			0
@entity63 of @entity88 and @entity91 's @entity90 clash during a test match back in 1981 @entity93 and @entity94 exchange words during @entity88 's clash with @entity97 in @entity98 the @entity64 are n't the only exponents of what the modern cricketer ludicrously calls ' mental disintegration '			2
typically , they 're just better at it than everybody else			0
the point is , though , that it 's not amusing and there is too much of it			2
the current interpretation of sledging is one step removed from bar room name calling and before long there will be a fight on a first class cricket pitch			0
former @entity116 captain @entity62 – now chairman of the @entity118 's @entity117 – has asked for the issue to be on the agenda of next week 's meeting and he is quite right to do so			2
former @entity116 cricket captain @entity62 , picutred in 1981 , has called to stamp out sledging @entity123 when you can really play , you can play just about anywhere			1
back from a break in the @entity127 , @entity123 must have wished he was back in his hammock when manager @entity129 asked him to play centre forward against @entity131 and @entity132 on tuesday night			1
at times during the first half , the little @entity133 forward looked as likely to score as @entity135 , who was n't even at the ground			1
@entity123 , though , has football intelligence and , like all the good players , he found a way to get it done			1
his dash towards goal from deep for @entity133 's equaliser resembled a rugby scrum - half spotting a gap from the 20 - metre line and was the work of a quick mind			1
all that @entity149 nonsense about @entity123 complaining about tiredness in october sounds like background noise now and it should have been treated as such at the time			1
@entity123 shoots past @entity152 's @entity132 ( centre ) and @entity154 ( right ) to score for @entity133 what 's not @entity156 like the day @entity157 drove his car in to a fire hydrant outside his house , sometimes it 's not the incident that ultimately transpires to be important but what it reveals			1
so it is with the curious case of @entity166 and the stolen penalty kick			1
@entity166 missed a penalty as @entity156 drew 0 - 0 against @entity169 at @entity170 on monday @entity166 ( second left ) demanded to take the penalty despite @entity171 ( left ) being @entity156 's regular taker three questions : where was captain @entity175 when @entity166 decided to shove @entity171 to the back of the queue ? why did @entity171 give way so meekly ? why , in essence , did @entity166 feel so confident he could get away with his act of impertinence in the first place ? these are the issues that make @entity156 look as though they have gone soft under @entity185			1
a couple of weeks ago , @entity175 gave newspaper interviews claiming media stories about shouting matches in the dressing room were so false they made him laugh			0
one final question : @entity156 are four points from the relegation zone			2
if nobody is shouting , why not ? the @entity196 dragged his penalty wide of @entity199 's goal as the game remained goalless just before half - time @entity166 watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of @entity199 @entity206 the clip in which @entity209 manager @entity208 appeared to refer to his opponents as ' @entity211 ' should have been the stand out blooper on @entity214			1
however , he was eclipsed by one of the programme 's own as @entity206 provided an insight in to what can happen if you do n't pay attention			2
there was a beautiful arrogance about @entity206 's football but that does n't work as an analyst and last weekend he appeared short on preparation			2
asked by host @entity228 about @entity229 , he started to talk about @entity230			0
one manages @entity231 while the other is occasionally a centre forward for @entity133			2
later in the show , @entity228 commented : ' @entity234 in to the top half ' to which his guest replied : ' could be			0
' @entity234 are , of course , already tenth			0
small details perhaps but it 's the small details that give a pundit the platform on which he can make broader and bolder statements with credibility			2
without these he is nothing			0
@entity206 appeared short on preparation when the former @entity248 player appeared on @entity214 @entity249 @entity250 can make you so unhappy it 's no wonder those who depend on it to feed the kids find ways of pretending that the bad stuff was really quite good			0
this was @entity249 after his final round in @entity260 last weekend			0
' i did n't hit many fairways and i did n't make many putts , ' said the @entity264			0
' on the other hand i was playing really good golf			0
' @entity249 was defeated by two over the course of 14 holes at @entity260 last week certainly @entity249 's collapse from ten shots clear to defeat by two over the course of 14 holes hints at much more bad than good but the really sad thing about his demise is that the bloke who actually won the thing – world number 357 @entity277 – is already lost in the story			0
after all , who remembers the name of the horse who won the @entity283 in 1956 ? @entity284 should be celebrating the greatest day of his young life but the reality is that the 22 - year - old is already on his way to becoming little more than an answer to a rather obscure quiz question			0
* the horse was called @entity293 , by the way .			0

@entity123 scored for @entity133 in the @entity15 against @entity152
