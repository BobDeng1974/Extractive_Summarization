a mother of four has pledged to remove her children from school to attend an ancient @entity4 festival - despite facing fines or even prosecution			1
@entity7 , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ' @entity11 celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her ' religion , culture and heritage			1
' the school blocked her request under a government crackdown on unauthorised absences announced in 2013			2
mrs @entity7 pictured with her son @entity22 ( far left ) , @entity23 ( centre ) and @entity25 ( right ) at last year 's @entity4 festival but mrs @entity7 said she would be willing to take the consequences of any police action to take her children @entity22 , 11 , @entity23 , 5 , @entity25 , 8 , and four month old baby faith to the event			1
the annual may 1 celebration is a centuries ' old tradition , involving music and dancing through the streets , believed by some to be an ancient pagan fertility ritual which heralds the arrival of spring			1
held every year in @entity41 , @entity42 at midnight on may 1 , it consists of parades and celebrations throughout the town and into the following day			1
mrs @entity7 , who moved from @entity41 to @entity46 , @entity42 , eight years ago , said : ' i think it 's ridiculous that i 'm being told i ca n't take my children to the event			1
' @entity51 is something which my family has celebrated for generations			0
' it 's part of our heritage , our culture and our religion			1
if i wanted to take children out of school for some other religion i think it would be a different story			1
' i do n't expect the @entity46 schools to close , but i do think that any school in @entity42 should be sensitive to the needs of people from @entity41 to return to their home town on may 1			1
the event itself is educational			0
' mrs @entity7 , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ' @entity11 celebrations			1
pictured from left to right is @entity25 , 8 , @entity22 , 11 , @entity76 , 4 months , and @entity23 , 5 in 2013 , former education secretary @entity77 ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year for pupils			0
new guidelines state that children should only be taken out of school during term - time if it is an ' exceptional circumstance '			2
government rules state that it is at the discretion of each individual school to authorise or reject absence requests			0
under the current system , parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a £ 60 fine per child , rising to £ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days			1
failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution , with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months			0
@entity105 children are included in the ' @entity51 tradition			0
but leaders at @entity108 in @entity46 would not authorise mrs @entity7 ' request for her children to join them			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' for @entity41 residents the day is a massively important part of their cultural heritage			1
' i 'm not an expert on its origins but i do believe it can be described as having religious significance			0
' just because i do n't live in @entity41 any more does n't mean i ca n't celebrate my religion			1
i would do the same even if i lived in @entity120			0
' the crackdown by the government on absences was outlined in 2013 and stipulates children should attend lessons rather than take time off to suit parental convenience			2
the crackdown was announced by the then education secretary @entity77 who intended to stop parents taking children out of school to benefit from cheaper holidays			2
mrs @entity7 said the festival was part of her family 's religion , culture and heritage but the government insists that local head teachers still have the discretion to approve up to ten absences a year ' in exceptional circumstances '			1
bishop @entity108 declined to comment			0
in @entity41 , where children are an integral part of the festival , the school closes so pupils can take part in the early - morning dances			1
@entity152 head teacher @entity151 said : ' we take may 1 as a community closure day as the majority of our children and staff will be taking part in the festivities			2
' it is such an important part of their cultural heritage that we feel it is extremely important for us to support and celebrate it			2
' i can understand the position of the @entity46 schools , however			0
' guidelines on allowing absence nowadays are incredibly tight			0
i would imagine a number of schools in the area get requests like this , and not necessarily from people who can claim any legitimate link to @entity41			0
' mrs @entity7 , who is currently on maternity leave from her job as a @entity179 , said that she has attended the event every year since she was born and for residents of @entity41 it was more important than @entity183			1
she said : ' we see it as more important than @entity183			0
it is such an important @entity42 tradition , but if the children can not go how are we supposed to keep it alive ? ' obviously we celebrate @entity183 , but the fact we see this as more important shows the scale of what it means to us			2
' i will be taking the kids out as i strongly believe we should be allowed to keep our heritage alive			0
' they all have a 100 per cent attendance record			0
i never take them out for a holiday			0
' but everyone in @entity41 takes part			2
people who once lived there come from the other side of the world to take part			0
it is in their blood			0
