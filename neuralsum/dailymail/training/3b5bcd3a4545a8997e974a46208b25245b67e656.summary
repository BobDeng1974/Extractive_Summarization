the @entity14 - born television chef and school meals campaigner , who has sold more than 10 million cook books , is ranked second only to @entity18 author @entity17			1

together , the four chefs account for 40 per cent of all the cook books sold in @entity9 since records began in 1998			1
the success of the chefs is due in no small part to the fact that all four have fronted high - profile tv shows – and other television personalities and celebrities also feature strongly in the list			1

meanwhile @entity131 creator @entity130 , @entity133 author @entity132 and @entity134 the creator of the @entity137 stories are also in the @entity138			0
noticeable by their absence are classic works such as @entity143 ’s @entity142 and @entity144 by @entity145			0
