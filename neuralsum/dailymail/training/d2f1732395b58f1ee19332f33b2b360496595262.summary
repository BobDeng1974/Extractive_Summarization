the @entity0 has had its share of renowned dead - ball specialists down the years , with the likes of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 among them			2
however , none of them make the top three most clinical players of the last 14 years when it comes to scoring direct from free - kicks			0
instead , top of the pile is @entity16 's @entity15 who , based on official @entity0 data , has been the deadliest set - piece exponent during that period			1
@entity15 is the @entity0 's most deadly free - kick taker of all - time the @entity22 scores from a set - piece for @entity16 against @entity24 last year the @entity25 international has scored five of his 28 attempts , giving him a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent - almost three times the success rate of @entity32 ace @entity6 , who is ninth on our list with 6.6 per cent ( five goals from 76 shots )			1
second on the list - compiled from players who have scored five or more free - kicks since the start of the 2001 - 02 season - is @entity43 's @entity42 , who showed his prowess with a brilliant set - piece strike against @entity46 at the weekend			2
that was the 11th time the @entity48 international has scored direct from 90 free - kick attempts in the @entity0 , giving him a conversion rate of 12.2 per cent			1
at that current rate , the final tally is set to be around 26 at the end of the campaign - well down on the 39 scored last season when @entity57 , @entity15 and @entity6 were especially deadly , and a figure which would represent the second lowest in the 13 - and - a - half - seasons since official records began in 2001/02			0
the highest number of free - kick goals scored in the last 14 years goes to former @entity63 striker @entity62 with 12 ( 8.3 per cent ) , but it must be noted that he , along with the likes of third - placed @entity4 ( five goals at 9.3 per cent ) , were also playing top - flight football before the 2001 - 02 season			2
former @entity68 playmaker @entity15 has scored five of his 28 attempts , a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent @entity71 is unable to stop a @entity15 free - kick during @entity68 's 3 - 3 draw against @entity16 in 2012 @entity74 's @entity57 has n't been able to match his impressive free - kick success rate of last season so far 246 shots direct from free - kicks have been attempted in the @entity0 this season , an average of 1.12 per match			1
that is by far the lowest amount , with the highest coming in the 2008 - 09 season when the average per game was 1.72 , with 31 goals scored during the campaign from 652 tries			0
perhaps it is no coincidence that season was also @entity5 's final one in @entity94			0
the former @entity16 man is famed for his dead - ball prowess and willingness to try his luck from most ranges and angles , and it should be no surprise to see him near the top of the list for free - kick attempts in the @entity0 since the start of the 2001 - 02 campaign			0
@entity42 scores from a free - kick against @entity46 - his 11th goal from 90 set piece attempts @entity4 , known for his fantastic free - kicks , finish in fourth place with a 9.3 per cent conversion rate the current @entity114 star and reigning @entity116 winner had 164 shots from free - kicks in top - flight matches and scored 10 during his time at @entity16 , for a conversion rate of 6.1 per cent			1
that ranks him the 11th most clinical player on our list , @entity42 , @entity126 ( six goals at 9.7 per cent ) , @entity4 ( five goals at 9.3 per cent ) and @entity128 ( seven goals at 9.0 per cent ) complete the top five			0
@entity131 had the most attempts of players who had scored five or more free - kicks , with the midfielder trying his luck 175 times for seven goals ( 4.0 per cent )			0
@entity5 had 164 shots from free - kicks in top - flight matches and scored 10 during his time at @entity16 former @entity68 striker @entity126 is third on the most deadly set - piece takers list @entity62 scored the most direct free - kicks with 12 - his conversion rate was 8.3 per cent			1

@entity15 is most clinical set - piece taker in the last 14 years
he has scored five of his 28 attempts - a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent
@entity42 has scored 11 of his 90 attempts
@entity4 and @entity126 feature in the top 10
