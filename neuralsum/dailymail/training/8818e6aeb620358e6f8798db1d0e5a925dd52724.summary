an @entity1 man who purchased the last - ever @entity3 's meal sold before the chain closed down in the country in 2009 was stunned when he found it did not go mouldy			1
@entity7 , 28 , waited until the end of the fast - food chain 's last day to buy a cheeseburger together with a portion of fries			1
he then donated his purchase to the @entity14 of @entity1 , where it stayed on display for three years before it was returned to him			2
' they had it on display until somebody complained and it was decided that a museum was not the appropriate place for food on display like this			0
' so they asked me for permission to destroy it			0
' but i regard it as a historical item now			0
i think it 's incredible that it seems to show no signs of decomposition , although apparently the fact that there were fewer chips returned to me was because some museum visitors had eaten some of them			0
' the museum wanted to destroy the meal after visitors complained that it was an inappropriate exhibit fewer chips were returned to mr @entity7 because visitors had eaten some of them the burger spent the first three years stored in a plastic bag when it did not change at all			1
in 2012 , after he took it back from the museum , it went on display at the bar of his local hotel in the capital @entity66			0
' we no longer have a @entity3 's here , but we do have a @entity3 's burger and it 's probably the oldest in the world , so i reckon we should n't complain too much , ' mr @entity7 said @entity1 is one of the only countries in the world that has no @entity3 's			1
there used to be three branches of the fast food chain on the island until the 2009 financial crisis made it uneconomical to continue with the business			2
with only 300,000 people in the country and the fact that @entity1 is a remote island location , the company said that the 2009 financial crisis had been the kiss of death .			2

@entity7 bought the burger on *31* october 2009 in @entity1
donated the fast - food meal to @entity93 for *posterity*
@entity1 is one of the only countries in the world that has no @entity3 's
