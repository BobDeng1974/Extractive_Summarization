by @entity1 reporter published : 17:06 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 17:19 est , 17 october 2012 these are the four women who have inadvertently found themselves at the centre of a public furore after @entity5 boasted he was given ' whole binders full of women ' capable of joining his cabinet			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were appointed to four of the 11 cabinet positions when @entity5 became @entity15 governor , indicating they were handpicked from the now notorious binder he referenced during the presidential debate			1
but , as @entity5 's claim about his bizarre hiring technique is ridiculed in a slew of internet memes , the women 's group he claimed he recruited to find qualified female candidates has disputed his account			1
the online buzz has thrust issues of women 's equality and employment - and the candidates commitment to them - to the forefront of the agenda as election day looms			1
in response to a question about hiring equality in tuesday night 's debate , @entity5 said he was so concerned about the number of women in the cabinet that he sought help from women 's groups			1
i went to a number of women ’s groups and said , " can you help us find folks , " and they brought us whole binders full of women			1
' the odd claim sparked outcry and ridicule across social media - with mocking @entity75 and @entity76 accounts cropping up within minutes - and among @entity77			0
it has also cast a spotlight on the women who featured among the pages of the binders and were eventually successful in securing one of @entity5 's top jobs			1
three of the four women are @entity87 educated and remain in public service positions - yet have continued to face tough competition , and defeat , from men			2
vetted : @entity12 , left , resigned from her post as environmental affairs secretary after her appointment to spend more time with her family			0
@entity11 , right , was also on the cabinet @entity9 became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid			2
but at the end of the term , she ran for governor and faced in - party competition for the spot			0
the @entity112 pair were both eventually beaten by the male @entity77 candidate , @entity113			0
her later appointments to executive committees came at the hands of women , @entity118 and @entity119 , and she continues to work for @entity5 in his presidential campaign			1
fellow @entity87 graduate , @entity12 , was appointed as secretary of the executive office of environmental affairs , but left in 2005 - to be replaced by a man - to spend time with her children			1
@entity12 , who had come under fire for an outstanding tax bill of $ 1 million for a company she set up with her family before her resignation , went on to become a senior policy adviser			0
claims : @entity5 , pictured with president @entity133 at the second presidential debate at @entity135 , said he chose the women from a ' binder ' presented by a women 's group defiant : but women 's groups claim they approached @entity5 ( pictured with running mate @entity142 ) about vetting women to get more into top positions			1
and after he took office , their numbers fell @entity10 was appointed as secretary of workforce development under @entity5 and admitted that , as a @entity151 and @entity150 , many of her friends asked why she worked for him			1
@entity152 : this image from the @entity154 shows the cover of a binder listing women for high - level positions but @entity10 , now a professor at @entity159 , rallied for him at the @entity161 , saying : ' he would make an excellent president			2
' @entity11 served as the secretary of @entity165 after working in the state 's previous cabinet			2
following his term , she became the senior director of training and education for the @entity173 - a position she still holds			0
the nonpartisan @entity15 women 's coalition @entity176 - has argued against the series of events leading to these women 's hiring			1
before the election in 2002 , they appealed to @entity5 and his @entity77 opponent , @entity182 , to make a ' best effort ' to appoint women in proportion to the makeup of the state 's population			1
both campaigns agreed and the group started vetting potential candidates for the roles			0
' it was an initiative of women ’s organizations , not to force [ @entity5 ’s ] hand , but to make it be something he had to follow through on , ' @entity193 said in an interview			1
' he did n't go out looking for these binders			0
' @entity202 , associate director of the @entity154 , which founded @entity176 , said : ' following the election , @entity176 formed committees for each cabinet post in the administration and began the process of recruiting , interviewing , and vetting women applicants			2
at odds : vice president @entity211 , right , said it was troubling @entity5 had been unable to find qualified women , while @entity142 , left , argued he had just wanted to show he had been thorough after @entity5 became governor in 2003 , @entity9 became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid			1
like @entity5 , she chose not to take a salary for the position			2
at the end of the term , she ran for governor and faced in - party competition for the spot			0
they were both eventually beaten by the male @entity77 candidate , @entity113			0
her later appointments to executive committees came at the hands of women , @entity118 and @entity119 , and she continues to work for @entity5 in his presidential campaign			1
fellow @entity87 graduate , @entity12 , was appointed as secretary of the executive office of environmental affairs , but left in 2005 - to be replaced by a man - to spend time with her children			1

@entity10 was appointed as secretary of workforce development under @entity5 and admitted that , as a @entity151 and @entity150 , many of her friends asked why she worked for him			2
but @entity10 , now a professor at @entity159 , rallied for him at the @entity161 , saying : ' he would make an excellent president			0
' @entity11 served as the secretary of @entity165 after working in the state 's previous cabinet			2
following his term , she became the senior director of training and education for the @entity173 - a position she still holds			0
' those committees selected top applicants for each position and presented this information to the administration for follow - up interviews and consideration for appointment			2
' @entity269 , former chairwoman of @entity176 , added that @entity5 had little contact with @entity176 and his nominee for lieutenant governor , @entity9 , worked with the organization for the project			2
@entity5 never once met with the group and members assumed he was busy , she added			1
before @entity5 became governor in 2002 , women comprised around 30 per cent of the all appointed senior - level posts in the state			1
by 2004 , 42 per cent of new appointments by the administration were female , but the years after , it dropped to 25 per cent , @entity202 revealed in a statement			0
in @entity5 's cabinet , four of the 11 posts were filled by women until one , @entity12 , left - and was replaced by a man			1
and @entity182 argued that , even though there was initially some improvement , men still filled the more important jobs			2
' there is certainly glaring evidence that he has n't put women in places of extreme power , ' @entity293 , president of the @entity15 chapter of the @entity295 , said in 2003			0
' he has chosen to surround himself with male chiefs			0
' @entity302 , who was also involved in the effort to recruit female candidates , said she was stunned that @entity5 , who had 25 years of experience in business , needed help finding women			1
she added : ' all i know is that when he was elected governor , he made a promise to make his best efforts that women would be proportionate to the percentage of women in @entity15			0
' by the time he left office , it was 25 percent			0
to me , that does n't speak to a great commitment to women in the workplace			0
' his statement at the debate also gathered criticism from vice president @entity211 , who said he was baffled as to why @entity5 would need help finding women to employ			1
' i 've never had any problem when there 's a job opening having as many women apply as men , ' @entity211 told @entity334 on wednesday			0
ridicule : the comments by @entity5 sparked a social networking frenzy and viewers created memes on @entity75 dig : viewers laughed at the bizarre statement on @entity76 , and @entity77 also jumped on the phrase ' there 's so many qualified women walking around in @entity344 , @entity15 , so many qualified women walking around every place in this country , the idea you got to go ask help to find one , i did n't quite understand what he was talking about			1
' @entity5 's running mate , @entity354 , attempted to pick up the pieces and explain the comment			2
' all he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor , ' he said			0
' that 's really what he was saying			0
and by the way , he has an exceptional record of hiring women in very prominent positions in his administration and that 's the point he was making			0
' see below for video			0

in presidential debate , @entity5 said he had approached a women 's group when trying to recruit and they had given him ' binders full of women '
@entity5 filled four out of his 11 cabinet posts with women in 2003
but one left in 2005 - to be replaced by a man
now the women 's group claims they approached @entity5 to improve number of female employees in top jobs
after he was in office , numbers of women in top jobs *decreased*
