by @entity0 @entity1 can still remember the moment in august 1992 that he received a call offering him a position in the astronaut program at @entity6			1
' i remember putting the phone down and thinking , wow , my life has just changed in ways i ca n't begin to imagine			0
how does this happen ? a kid from @entity14 has just joined @entity6 , ' he told @entity15			2
with the offer , dr @entity1 , 62 , became the first @entity17 to travel into space			1
he has just hung up his space helmet , retiring after a 22 - year career with @entity6 , which has seen him undertake four space flights , 177 days in orbit , a visit to the @entity25 , and a space walk			1
right : dr @entity1 preparing to launch on the 2005 mission , which was his last space flight @entity1 completed four space flights during his 22 years as an astronaut			1
on his 1998 stay on the @entity25 he went on a six and a half hour space walk			2
pictured : another astronaut on dr @entity1 's 2005 space walk undertaking a space walk on each of his four missions dr @entity1 took with him an artefact from @entity17 exploration history			1
for his first mission , a flight on - board the space shuttle @entity49 in 1996 , dr @entity1 took a fragment of wood from captain @entity52 's @entity49 , from which the shuttle got its name			1
' i wonder what @entity52 would have thought about a piece of the ship orbiting the earth , ' he said to @entity15			2
on his subsequent trips , the artefacts he carried included a slide rule from @entity65 's @entity64 expedition , the watch worn by aviator @entity67 , and the pilot wings of @entity69 , who was the first person to fly from @entity70 to @entity71 in less than 30 days			2
carrying the objects was a way to honour the history of @entity17 exploration , something that was particularly important to dr @entity1 , who had to take up dual @entity78 citizenship to become an astronaut , and was launched into space wearing a @entity78 flag , not an @entity17 one , emblazoned on his space suit			1
dr @entity1 grew up in @entity14 during the space race and watched in awe as the first humans ventured into space			1
' i had a bent toward things spacey			0
i had read science fiction , i had read space books , and then seeing things unfold in the space race made it all very real , ' he said			2
' but of course for a kid growing up in @entity14 it was n't a real prospect at all			0
' dr @entity1 received a first - class honours degree and later a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the @entity102 but said that if someone had told him at his graduation ceremony that his career would see him follow his astronaut heroes he simply would not have believed them			1
' i would have thought someone was on drugs			0
it was n't until my late 20s that i realised i had accrued the sort of credentials that might make this possible , and then i made a very serious commitment to pursuing it			0
' the commitment included moving to the @entity78 , being selected from thousands of applicants , subjected to psychological evaluations and interviews , as well as a ' very serious medical examination ' in which he said ' they poke and prod at you in ways that you could n't begin to imagine			0
' a proud @entity17 : dr @entity1 tries on various patriotic outfits in the lead - up to embarking on the @entity78 space shuttle @entity49 dr @entity1 spent more than four months living on the @entity25 ( pictured ) in 1998			1
in preparation for the trip he spent a long time training in @entity129 and said that being a cosmonaut seemed even more far - fetched than being an astronaut ( @entity132 ) the @entity49 launches from the @entity133 on may 19 , 1996 , the first time dr @entity1 left the earth 's atmosphere			1
( @entity136 ) one of the crew on dr @entity1 's last mission in 2005 on a space walk unique viewpoint : @entity1 's missions gave him the rarest of opportunities , with this picture showing an inverted @entity145 over the @entity146 , and the @entity147 in the background high above the world : the @entity146 has been visited by a select few astronauts since its construction began in 1998 his first flight was not until 1996 , when he travelled on the space shuttle @entity49			1
before take - off he remembers lying on the launch pad thinking , ' i do n't know how the next 10 minutes are going to go			0
' ' it 's the most extraordinary ride you can ever imagine , ' he said			0
during its first orbit , the space shuttle flew over @entity71 and the premier of @entity71 had encouraged @entity14 's residents to turn on their lights at the time the space shuttle was due to fly over the city			2
' and they did and i saw it , it was amazing , ' he said			0
dr @entity1 said that @entity71 is actually very easy to spot from space			1
' it is so strikingly red , it contrasts against the blue ocean			0
i remember many great views of @entity71 , flying over it			2
' other highlights for dr @entity1 included seeing the @entity179 – ' these beautiful green , iridescent , shining , shimmering lights over @entity64 ' – and completing a six - and - a - half hour space walk			2
' i was high up on the trusses , on the dark side of the earth and i turned away from the space station			0
' it was a blackness that was absolutely amazing , i 've never seen anything as black and dark as looking out into infinity , just seeing the space station suspended in that nothingness			0
' ( @entity132 ) @entity193 and @entity78 astronauts work together in 2005 during the @entity31 mission following the @entity33 accident			0
this was dr @entity1 's last space flight			1
( @entity136 ) on the same flight another astronaut on a space walk @entity147 - rise : dr @entity1 grew up in @entity14 during the space race and said he was always interested in space , but never dreamed that he could actually become an astronaut @entity1 ( front left ) and the crew of the 2005 mission following the @entity33 accident pose for a photo in zero gravity			1
dr @entity1 said that scuba - diving was the closest approximation to zero gravity and scuba - diving was a key way of training for a space mission in 1998 , dr @entity1 spent 130 days aboard the @entity129 @entity25 and was the last astronaut from @entity6 to visit it			1
he said that life in zero gravity is ' very unnatural ' but something he adjusted to very quickly			0
' it 's a great feeling , ' he said			0
' scuba - diving is the nearest approximation , but even when you 're scuba - diving there is a definite up and down , but in space there is no up			0
' this presents a particular problem for sleeping , he said , which requires the astronaut to tie their sleeping bag somewhere and zip themselves in			0
' you zip yourself in or you 'll float out of it during the night , ' he said			0
dr @entity1 is married to a fellow astronaut , @entity78 @entity239 , with whom he lives in @entity240 , @entity241			2
she went on her first space flight in 2010 , an experience which gave dr @entity1 ' a much deeper appreciation for what [ people ] go through when they watch their better halves launch '			1
initial fears give way to enjoyment of the experience , and in the end as he watched his wife launch ' there 's a certain amount of envy actually and you think that 's fantastic			0
' apart from a wish that he could have visited the moon , dr @entity1 says he has no complaints about his extraordinary career			2
he will spend his retirement building a house on some ranch property that he and his wife purchased in central @entity241 and doing speaking engagements			0
' i think i 've got a good story to tell			0
to tell young people to aim high – the sky is not the limit ! ' left : dr @entity1 arrives at the @entity133 in his jet in 2005			2
right : @entity1 of @entity71 smiles on the flight deck of the shuttle discovery in 2005 dr @entity1 returned to @entity147 on the @entity145 after his four month stay on the @entity25 dr @entity1 said that one of the most extraordinary things he saw while in space was the ' blackness ' while he was on a space walk			1
right : dr @entity1 ( centre ) on board the @entity25 with the station commander @entity284 ( left ) @entity1 , whose wife is also an astronaut , will spend his retirement building a house on their ranch property in @entity241 and completing speaking engagements write caption here dr @entity1 is married to a fellow astronaut , @entity239 , whose first space flight was in 2010			1
the pair have never been in space together , dr @entity1 said it was against @entity6 policy to send a husband and wife up on the same mission @entity1 dreamed of being an astronaut as a young child growing up in @entity14 , but says it was not a dream that was really within his reach			1

@entity1 , @entity71 's first and only man in space , has retired after 22 years working for @entity6
he has spent 177 days in space over four missions , including four months living on the @entity25
dr @entity1 told of how he carried a piece of wood from @entity49 on board his first space flight
