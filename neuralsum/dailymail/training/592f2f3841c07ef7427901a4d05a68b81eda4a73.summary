' we remain firmly committed to fulfilling our long - term mission to help people everywhere have access to their own genetic data and have the ability to use that information to improve their lives , ' @entity33 said in a statement			1
' our goal is to work cooperatively with the @entity8 to provide that opportunity in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefit to people and the validity of the science that underlies the test			0
