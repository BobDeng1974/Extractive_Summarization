threat to nation : @entity1 's anti-spy agency is to snoop through office emails in a bid to preempt disgruntled employees threatening the nation 's security by going rogue @entity8 , the @entity1 intelligence organisation which unmasks spies , is sponsoring research at @entity31 using ' behavioural analysis ' to identify rogue employees , @entity28 reports			1
the university is currently advertising the three and a half year phd post financed by @entity8 - and paying £ 22,000 a year			0
the university said : ' the research will investigate the use of techniques from the field of natural language processing to detect the early indicators of an insider threat within an organisation 's unstructured internal data			2
' this means that the person they hire will study email correspondences among employees who have become disgruntled and who may have an axe to grind			1
@entity8 , the @entity1 intelligence organisation which unmasks spies , is based in @entity54 , @entity55 , above			1
the £ 1.1billion electronic spy centre ( above ) has been nicknamed @entity57 @entity58 , professor of psychology at the university , said : ' instead of ending their email with ' see ya ! ' they might suddenly offer you ' kind regards '			2
' these changes are important and could hint at a disgruntled employee about to go rogue			2
' the university say they will be using advanced techniques to predict anomalous behavior among staff			0
@entity58 , professor of psychology at @entity31 , said changes in the tone of emails ' could hint at a disgruntled employee about to go rogue ' the aim is to prevent a recurrence of spies such as @entity82 and @entity83 - who were insiders whose behaviour became noticeably out of character			1
the revelation comes shortly after a judgement which ruled that @entity8 's mass surveillance programmes were found to be lawful - despite protests from privacy campaigners			0
human rights groups @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 brought a legal challenge against @entity8 following disclosures made by @entity98 @entity97 ( @entity97 ) whistleblower @entity99 about mass surveillance programmes known as @entity101 and @entity102			0

' we have left open for further argument the question as to whether prior hereto there has been a breach			0
' @entity94 immediately said it would appeal the decision at the @entity127 - there is no domestic right of appeal			0
@entity94 @entity1 's legal advisor , @entity131 , said : ' the government 's entire defence has amounted to ' trust us ' and now the tribunal has said the same			1

the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) has turned its attention to ' insider ' threats within companies - meaning staff gossip and gripes could now be checked for hidden agendas ' we will now appeal to @entity144 , who might not be as inclined to put their trust in the @entity133 given what we know so far			1
' @entity149 , legal director for @entity92 , which also intends to appeal to the @entity106 , said : ' so a secretive court thinks that secret safeguards shown to it in secret are an adequate protection of our privacy			0
