at an age when most kids are starting high school , @entity1 teen @entity0 , now 24 , was carrying out bloody murders for one of @entity8 's most sadistic and violent drug cartels			1
he grew up one of nine siblings on ramshackle @entity11 , just blocks away from the @entity8 border in @entity13 , @entity1			1
a close friend , @entity14 , now 26 , lived nearby			1
both @entity15 and @entity14 were born to a families with relatives on both sides of the @entity20 - @entity1 border			1
it was the ease with which the boys could cross back and forth across the border that made them valuable to the @entity25 drug cartel			1

the question remains : how did two @entity20 teenagers become killers - for - hire for a @entity8 drug cartel ? @entity15 has spoken about his past at various times over the seven years since his arrest			1
his feelings about his bloody work have changed over the years , from chilling braggadocio as a 19 - year - old in police interviews , to softly spoken , wet - eyed pleas for understanding in his latest interviews			2

remorseless : @entity14 appears unrepentant for his nightmarish crimes			1

born to a hairstylist mother and father who worked construction , @entity15 told @entity98 he had a good childhood and grew up playing soccer and baseball , and loved skateboarding earning him the nickname ' @entity104 ' , as in @entity105			2
but the kind of mischief @entity15 would get up to in his young life could n't be more different from the cartoon kid 's boyish pranks			1
river to hell : the international bridge over the @entity40 that links @entity13 , @entity1 to @entity13 , @entity8 for @entity84 , the @entity8 border town of @entity13 , with its nightlife , its danger and its glamor , intrigued the restless teen , and one fateful night , his curiosity was to be sated			1

i could n't believe what i was seeing			0
people getting tortured , killed , decapitated			0
it was kind of hard to believe			0
' an argument broke out : a man wanted to know what @entity15 , a stranger , was doing there			0
he stood over the 13 - year - old and handed him a gun			2
in that moment , even though it was another man he was instructed to kill , @entity15 's life was over			1
' i shot him , ' @entity15 said			0
' @entity15 was trained in a secret camp where he learned how to be a sicario , a hitman			0

top dog : @entity152 was at the head of the most vicious , violent and depraved of @entity8 's drug cartels until his arrest last month last month , @entity25 leader @entity152 , widely believed to be responsible for escalating the depraved and sadistic wave of narco - terror occurring along the borderlands , was arrested			1

@entity14 estimates he killed between 20 and 30 people			1
police say that one of the crimes for which @entity14 is serving time is the kidnap and murder of two @entity20 teenagers , during which he slashed them with a bottle , collected their blood in a glass and toasted the @entity176 , the personification of death			1
according to a @entity181 article from 2009 , most of the @entity20 youths were recruited in a @entity13 disco called @entity183 , situated in the main square just across one of two bridges that connect the two @entity187			0
teenagers go there to drink and dance , but cartel members lurk there , keeping an eye out for possible recruits			2
detective @entity195 of the @entity196 told the @entity181 , ' the cartels - they just seduce you			2
they wave that power , that cash , the cars , the easy money			0
and these kids all have that romantic notion they are going to live forever			0
' solitary : before he was even at the legal drinking age , @entity15 was locked up forever in solitary confinement marked man : @entity15 , like @entity14 , received prison tattoos after his arrest , the only outward indication of what occurred in his past teenage dream : @entity14 and @entity15 were living like regular teenagers before being drawn into a world of murder , drugs and cash @entity15 and @entity14 were paid a $ 500 retainer each week			1

in 2009 @entity14 was arrested and pleaded guilty to killing seven men and to conspiracy to kidnap and kill in a foreign country			1
he was sentenced to more than 80 years in prison			2
not long after , @entity15 botched an assassination attempt in @entity8 , missing the victim and killing innocent people			1
he knew he 'd pay for the mistake with his life			2
the teenager turned himself in to @entity8 police , then called detective @entity195 to ask to be extradited to the @entity20 , fearing reprisal for his error , or from rival gang member			1
he is only in his 20s , but he 's facing a lifetime of monotony in solitary confinement			1
for him , there is no future			0
once he bragged to police , ' if i can not hit you in the forehead from a distance , i will kneel down in front of you and put my forehead against the muzzle of your gun			0
i will look you in the eyes while you kill me			2
' now , he tells only of sorrow			0
