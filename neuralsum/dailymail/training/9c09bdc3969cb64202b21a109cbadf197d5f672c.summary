floating around the globe , drifting from country to country , never staying in one place long enough to get bored … if you like travelling , life on the @entity5 , the world ’s first floating city , sounds perfect			1
there ’s only a couple of hitches – it ’s not built yet , and it ’s going to look an awful lot like a multi-storey carpark when it is			2
the ship would spend the whole time at sea , circling the globe once every two years , powered by solar and wave energy width : 750ft length : 4,500ft height : 350ft weight : 2.7 million tones capacity : 50,000 permanent residents with room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors , 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests			1
cost : $ 10 billion buildings : accommodation , schools , hospitals , businesses , parks , promenades , an art gallery , a shopping centre , casino and airport its designers have released computer - generated photographs of what they hope the mile - long vessel will look like			1
it would have enough room for 50,000 permanent residents within its 25 storeys and boasts schools , hospitals , art galleries , shops , parks , an aquarium and a casino			1
it would even have its own airport on the roof , with a runway serving small private and commercial aircraft carrying up to 40 passengers each			0
@entity67 , director and vice-president of @entity14 - based firm @entity5 , said : ‘ the @entity5 will be the largest vessel ever built , and the first ever floating city			1
’ his company is trying to raise the estimated £ 6billion needed to turn the dream , which has been several years in the planning , into an ocean - going reality			1
‘ this will be a very heavily capitalised project and the global economy in the last few years has n’t been too inviting for unproven progressive projects like ours , ’ he added			0
‘ [ but ] in the last six months we ’ve been getting more interest in the project and we are hopeful we will raise the $ 1billion ( £ 600million ) to begin construction			0
’ the ship would spend 70 per cent of its time anchored off major cities and the rest sailing between countries			0
powered by solar panels and wave energy , the city would navigate from the east coast of the @entity94 across the @entity95 to @entity96 and into the @entity97			0
it would loop back and sail around the @entity99 at the tip of @entity101 and across to @entity102			0
heading into @entity104 , it would steer across the @entity105 before spending the end of the year on the west coast of @entity108			0
it would chase the summer sun into @entity111			0
if completed , the city will be 750ft at the beam , 350ft high and 4,500ft in length – four times longer than the @entity116 cruise ship which measures 1,132ft			2
visitors and residents would be able to leave the ship , either by plane or by boat thanks to a dock at the rear , concept pictured , to visit cities and countries where the ship will also pick up supplies as and when needed the @entity5 , concept pictured , is a mile long , 25 storeys high and features schools , hospitals , businesses , parks , promenades , an art gallery , a shopping centre , casino and airport on the roof the planned route , pictured , would take the ship from the east coast of the @entity94 across the @entity95 into @entity96 , passing @entity144 before looping back and sailing around @entity101 and across to @entity102			1
it would then travel into @entity104 before spending the end of the year on the west coast of the @entity94 and @entity111 in addition to 50,000 permanent residents , the @entity5 would also have room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors , 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests the airport , on the ship 's top deck , pictured , would serve private and small commercial aircraft carrying up to 40 passengers each			1
it could also be used to fly supplies to the ship			0
@entity162 could land and takeoff even when the ship is moving this drawing shows a cross section of the ship			0
if built , the whole vessel would be 750ft wide , 350ft tall and 4,500 ft long			2
this would make it four times longer than the @entity116 cruise ship the vessel , concept pictured , is just an idea at the moment until the @entity14 - based designers can raise at least $ 1 billion to start construction			1
the company said following a hiatus , and a drop in the global economy , it has started receiving interest in the ship again and hopes to raise this funding soon			2

the @entity5 is 25 storeys high and would feature a casino , an art gallery , a park and a shopping centre
the concept , designed by a @entity14 - based company would cost $ *10billion* if was *commissioned* to be built
the vessel could house 50,000 *people* but it would contain additional space to hold an extra 30,000 visitors
the ship would constantly sail around the world - doing a full circuit every two years - but would be too large to enter any ports
