by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:19 am on 17th february 2012 a scanner darkly : the machines are being turned off at @entity5 airports eye scanners which are meant to slash queues at airport passport control are coming under scrutiny after airports around the world started to scrap the costly machines			1
in the @entity5 , the scheme was introduced at a cost of $ 14billion but is now quietly being rolled back after officials concluded that the machines were slower than checking passports manually			1
now the @entity18 airports which have used the technology will have to reconsider their reliance on expensive electronics over human expertise			1
the last @entity5 government claimed that the iris scanners were capable of processing travellers in as little as 12 seconds			1
but after 385,000 passengers submitted their details , the scanners have been ditched at @entity30 and @entity31 airports , and they are expected to vanish from @entity32 and @entity33 after the @entity34			1
some irate travellers even ended up getting trapped inside the scanning booths when they malfunctioned			1
when the then immigration minister , @entity38 , unveiled the @entity39 , known as @entity39 , in 2004 , he claimed it would provide a ‘ watertight ’ check of identities as well as cutting queues			1
it was targeted at foreign passport holders resident in the @entity5 or who regularly travel here and wanted to avoid lengthy queues			1
they had to undergo a free 15 - minute registration to record the unique pattern of their iris every two years			2
plans to use the technology for @entity5 passports and even an ill - fated @entity56 were dropped after it emerged that up to one in ten travellers was wrongly rejected by the scanners			1
scanner inspection : @entity5 home secretary @entity61 tries out one of the new scanners in 2005 as they were hailed by ministers as a key weapon in the fight against terrorism and fraud trumpeted as a key tool in the fight against identity fraud , @entity39 scanners were expected to slash clues when they were launched by the @entity74 in 2004			1
but in reality the scanners were dead on arrival			2
the scheme cost $ 14million			2
immigration minister @entity38 boasted at launch that the scanners would cut waiting times to just 12 seconds per passenger			2
the devices , which are free to use , were aimed at regular travellers			2
but perversely , passengers who want to dodge queues by using the scanners have to queue up for a 15 - minute registration - then repeat the process every two years			0
with the registration scheme now closed , biometric scanners will be phased out within two years unless it it reopened			0
they then had to wait for manual checks to be performed			0
subsequently , facial recognition technology has been developed with the new generation of biometric passports which can be used at automated ‘ e-gates ’			0
these chip - enabled passports are not held by travellers from outside the @entity102 , however , and they have remained dependent on iris recognition			0
@entity104 , deputy general secretary of the @entity105 , said the @entity39 scheme had been beset with problems from the beginning			0
she added : ‘ @entity39 scanners are prone to throwing up false alerts when genuine travellers try to use them			0
we welcome the decision to phase them out			0
’ @entity116 , of privacy group @entity115 , said : ‘ this is recognition that iris scanning is an expensive failure			0
the money would be better spent employing more trained staff to use their initiative and check passports manually			0
’ a @entity126 spokesman said : ‘ we are phasing out @entity39 and will be replacing it with other types of gates that @entity132 passengers will be able to use			0

airports in @entity5 have concluded machines are worse than *traditional* *methods*
