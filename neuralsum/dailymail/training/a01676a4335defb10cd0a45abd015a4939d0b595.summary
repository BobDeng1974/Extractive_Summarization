@entity1 took more than £ 15,000 of tourniquets from the base where he served ' the @entity4 is an honourable service and depends on honour from servicemen			1
what they did n’t get from you was honour			0
' you stole and preyed on the fact that the whole operation relied on trust			0
' the items you stole operate to protect the armed forces when they are oversees defending our country			0
' mrs @entity96 , your role was to store the items in the home and then match and dispatch on ebay for the profit of both of you			2

after the hearing detective sergeant @entity130 said : ' the @entity28 police takes a robust approach to any theft from the defence estate which has the potential to harm the effectiveness of our @entity148			0
' we are particularly pleased with the successful convictions of these offenders as the tourniquets they stole are vital battlefield medical supplies			0
' the @entity1 ’s deceit did not stop these supplies from getting through to the frontline but nonetheless they stole these items without any thought for the effect they might have			0
' most military equipment is specifically designed for their use and we will seek to prosecute any suspects whose actions deprive them of it			0
' buyers of such items also need to be aware			0
there is a thriving market in military goods but it is their responsibility to check that the items they are buying are being sold legally			0
