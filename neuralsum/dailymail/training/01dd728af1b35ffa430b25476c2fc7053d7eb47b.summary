@entity0 are leading the race for @entity3 midfielder @entity2			1
@entity4 reported on tuesday that @entity5 and @entity6 had also made enquiries for the 20 - year - old but @entity9 looks to have persuaded the @entity10 21 international to join him at the @entity11			2
@entity12 was poised to join @entity13 on loan but was prevented by the @entity16 three - club rule which determined he had already played for @entity3 and @entity18 and could not join another top flight side			0
@entity2 is looking for a loan move after his spell at @entity18 came to an abrupt end @entity12 has 21 caps for the @entity25 under 21 side , and has also played for the @entity10 16 , 17 and 19 sides the young midfielder only made four appearances for @entity18 while on loan and appeared for @entity3 's under 21 side but they were deemed competitive games			1
@entity5 had @entity12 on loan in 2012 and are keen to give him a run of games as they bid to go up to the @entity36			0
@entity6 are better placed as they lie second in the @entity37 while @entity0 have a lot more ground to make up as @entity9 looks to ensure they move clear of the relegation zone first			0
the 20 - year - old is highly rated at @entity3 and @entity42 will be keen for @entity12 to sign for a club where he will play first - team football for the second half of the season			0
@entity9 ( centre ) would be interested in bringing @entity12 to @entity0 if they can break out the drop zone @entity2 was on the bench for @entity3 aged 15 ( left ) but has failed to fulfil his potential so far			1

@entity0 are leading the race to sign @entity2 from @entity3
