with him came a few dozen attractive @entity4 and @entity55 women who worked as ' b - girls , ' which is short for ' @entity57			1
' the scantily - clad women trolled swanky @entity6 bars looking for rich men – they were instructed to focus on expensive shoes and watches – and invited them back to private clubs operated by @entity3 's gang			1

the clubs even had vases where the women would pour out drinks so the men would have to order more			0
' i think he should be given credit for coming here and facing the music ' one victim , former @entity96 weatherman @entity94 , testified that he was charged some $ 43,000 over two nights through the scheme			0
in all , dozens of men were fraudulently charged between $ 400,000 and $ 1 million , according to court records			0

they each face more than 20 years in prison when they are sentenced later this year			0
' he did his job			0
he did what he was supposed to do , ' @entity132 said			0
assistant u.s. attorney @entity141 said @entity3 initially lied about how he broke his leg , telling investigators he slipped on ice			1
but @entity132 said that was only to protect his wife , who was still in @entity36 at the time			0
in all , 12 of those charged in the scheme pleaded guilty , including most of the ' @entity15 ' who have subsequently been deported			0
