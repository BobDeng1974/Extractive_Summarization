@entity5 , 23 , had been looking forward to travelling home from @entity7 to @entity8 last july after completing her studies for her masters degree in the @entity12 city			1
but she was mortified when she went to take her seat and discovered that she had to move due to her size - and would need a seatbelt extender			1
@entity5 weighed 23st 7lb at the time and was a size 28			1
@entity5 , 23 , from @entity18 in @entity19 lost an incredible 12 stone in nine months she has since slimmed down by eight sizes to a slender 12 , and she weighs a healthy 11st 7lb			1
' i had always been big , but the incident on the @entity26 flight was the catalyst for finally taking action to lose the weight , ' said @entity5 , from @entity18 in @entity19			1
' i boarded the busy plane and managed to grab an aisle seat - a seat i normally chose on account of the extra space			1
' i realised at that moment that i would need a seat belt extender , but when i asked for one the flight attendant explained that because i was the last row they could not have any one using an extender in those seats			1
' she then asked a lady in the row in front of me if she would swap seats			1
the passenger had a spare seat next to her			2
' the airline handled the move discreetly and without fuss			1
but a school group who had been sat opposite had witnessed the whole thing - it was a pretty painful and mortifying experience			1
' @entity5 pictured on her graduation day at @entity55			2
she slimmed down from 23st 7lbs to a svelte 11st 7lbs @entity5 had always been fond of her food and enjoyed feasting on takeaways - especially @entity58 turned a blind eye to the warning signs that her weight was spiralling out of control , even when she used to call her dad from the bottom of the road leading to their family home asking for a lift up the hill			1
but the plane ordeal persuaded her to tackle her weight once she arrived back in the @entity72			2
' i 'd always been on the big side , ' she said , ' even at primary school i was always the biggest of my friends and i got bigger in high school			2
' as i got older and had my own money to spend i would treat myself to a lot of fast food after my lessons			2

' it did hold me back though			0
i was n't able to do any of the activities that my friends were enjoying			0
if someone was going on a bike ride , i could n't go			0
