@entity0 hit a stoppage - time equaliser to deny @entity2 a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation from the @entity6			1
the @entity7 looked set to collect their first win in nine attempts - and their first under interim boss @entity10 - as they led 2 - 0 through goals in each half from @entity13 and @entity14			2
but @entity15 , also desperate for points at the other end of the table to maintain their promotion bid , pulled one back through @entity21 's penalty before @entity0 snatched a 2 - 2 draw at the death			1
@entity0 celebreates as he hits a stoppage - time equaliser to deny @entity2 a precious three points @entity2 , looking revitalised since former striker @entity10 took over from @entity26 earlier this month , threatened first after just two minutes when @entity27 found @entity28 , whose shot from the edge of the box was parried by @entity32			1
@entity15 almost went ahead after 15 minutes through a glancing header from @entity36 midfielder @entity34 , but the ball cannoned back off the crossbar			0
and in the 28th minute @entity2 got their noses in front when @entity13 latched on to @entity27 's long ball over the top , rounded @entity32 and fired into an empty net from 15 yards			2
it was the former @entity46 striker 's sixth goal of the season and , tellingly , only @entity2 's 14th away from home during a troubled campaign			0
@entity15 : @entity50 ( @entity51 - 71 ' ) @entity52 ( @entity53 - 71 ' ) @entity54 ( judge - 60 ' ) @entity56 substitutes : @entity58 toral judge @entity59 @entity2 : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity14 ( @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity13 substitutes : @entity69 @entity68 @entity15 poured forward in search of an equaliser before half - time but found @entity7 keeper @entity60 in inspired form , the @entity74 tipping a @entity76 curler over the top , blocking a header from @entity79 and turning @entity21 's free - kick around the post			1
@entity15 continued in the same vein after the interval but @entity56 fired over and @entity62 bravely blocked @entity34 's shot			0
and the @entity85 were hit by a sucker punch midway through the second half when @entity14 played the ball out to @entity28 , continued his run forward and nodded the winger 's lofted cross into an empty net from a yard out for his first senior goal			0
but @entity15 were offered a lifeline with six minutes remaining when @entity28 tripped @entity96 in the area and @entity21 rifled home the penalty			0
and in the first minute of injury time , with @entity2 pegged back in their own penalty area , right - back @entity0 fired through a crowd of players to snatch a dramatic equaliser			1
there was still time for substitute @entity107 to win it for @entity2 , but the striker 's shot flew agonisingly wide to leave the @entity7 players with their heads in their hands .			0

*struggling* @entity2 let a two - goal lead slip as they were held by @entity15
@entity13 and @entity14 had given the away side a *deserved* lead
@entity21 struck a penalty to revitalise the hosts at @entity122
the equaliser came in stoppage time when @entity0 found the net
