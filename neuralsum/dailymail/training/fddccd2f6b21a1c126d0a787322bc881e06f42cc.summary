by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 17:34 est , 15 august 2013 a little girl growing up today has no shortage of strong female role models - senators and presidential candidates , @entity6 and astronauts , governors and secretaries of state			2
and now , a female wiggle			0
@entity12 , the first woman to join @entity13 - a sort of @entity16 fab four of the preschool set - is making her @entity19 debut , kicking off a nationwide tour in @entity21 on saturday and starring in new episodes of ' @entity23 , @entity24 ! ' on @entity25 on aug. 19			1
in the @entity27 - coded @entity13 world , @entity12 is the @entity24 , and on early portions of the tour in @entity16 and @entity30 , she attracted enough tiny yellow clones with enormous bows on their heads that they called it the @entity36			1
@entity12 is joined in the new version of the group by original @entity56 and two fellow newbies : @entity59 @entity58 and @entity61 @entity60			1
but she 's clearly a fan favorite : tiny groupies have given her so many bows - yellow and pink , made from pipe cleaners and cardboard - that she quips she 'll need an extra room on her house to hold them			1
' essentially we 're all role models for boys and girls , but it 's really nice that girls have a choice , i guess , ' she says			0
with their peppy dancing , waggling fingers , exaggerated facial expressions and maniacally catchy songs like ' @entity80 ' and ' @entity81 , ' @entity13 emerged 22 years ago and seemed scientifically engineered to make a toddler , well , wiggle			1
the new members were announced last year and joined the retiring original @entity13 - @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 - on a farewell tour as ' @entity90			1
' the @entity36 : in the @entity27 - coded @entity13 world , @entity12 is the @entity24 , and on the tour in @entity16 and @entity30 , she attracted tiny yellow clones with enormous bows on their heads @entity12 , 23 , grew up with @entity13 and sharing the stage with @entity86 , the original @entity24 , she says , ' i just felt like i was 6 years old again			1
' the first time @entity60 sang ' @entity99 ' with @entity86 , he cried			0
each new member came from the touring cast of backup dancers and understudies , but there was much wiggly wisdom to impart - @entity107 fingers , wiggly dancing , @entity107 songs and instruments			2
and there was the mentoring offstage , where the new @entity13 hosted meet - and - greets with children with special needs			1
' they turn up and all they do is look at @entity12 the whole time			1
these 2 and 3 - year - olds have never seen @entity13 before , so @entity12 's their superstar ' ' there were no reality tv cameras rolling at the time - it sort of sounds like it - but no one was going to be eliminated			1
it was just a lovely year , ' @entity124 said			0
@entity124 was studying childhood education with @entity88 and @entity86 when he formed the group back in 1991 , hoping to combine what he was learning with his other passion , music			0
the @entity13 became a sensation in @entity16 and made their biggest splash across the pond about a decade later , helping launch ' @entity134 ' on the @entity136			1
they helped popularize children 's music on tv and ushered in an era of arena - packing kiddie concerts - at their peak , they sold out 12 shows at the @entity145			2
' i think @entity13 were the ones who said , this is going to be a show			1
it 's going to be a rock concert of sorts , and i think just like the tv show , they were doing these sorts of big , energetic pop concerts , ' says @entity157 , who writes about children 's music at @entity159 and reviews it for @entity162 's ' @entity161			0
' all told , @entity13 sold more than 23 million dvds and videos , 7 million cds and 8 million books			1
they have been broadcast in more than 100 countries and performed more concerts than the @entity169			0
the new guard : @entity12 is joined in the group by original @entity56 and two fellow newbies : @entity59 @entity58 and @entity61 @entity60			2
but she 's clearly a fan favorite preschool hit : with their peppy dancing , waggling fingers , exaggerated facial expressions and maniacally catchy songs , @entity13 seem scientifically engineered to make a toddler , well , wiggle but all that touring took its toll			2
in 2006 , @entity86 left the group because of a rare nervous system disorder			0
@entity87 briefly left the tour to be fitted with a pacemaker			2
@entity86 rejoined in 2012 , but soon he , @entity87 and @entity88 announced their retirement			0
field , who documented his own struggles with depression in a book , ' how i got my @entity195 , ' says it was an easy decision for him to stay on and be joined by new members			0
' the first month or so , it was very strange but it was still exciting , ' he says			0
' i think one of the reasons i love being on the road and continuing on is i get a routine going , i keep myself healthy , i eat well and have a really , really healthy lifestyle and i exercise all the time			0
i 'm 50 now but i 'm in the best shape of my life			0
' the @entity13 may not be quite the phenomenon they used to be - when they stop in @entity210 on this tour , they 'll be playing just one show at the @entity213			1
seen as a refreshing alternative to @entity215 when they debuted , they predated the revolution in more parent - friendly ' kindie ' music led by the likes of @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222			2
' if parents come away saying that was n't nearly as bad as i expected , then that 's just gravy for them			0
because they 're not playing for the parents ' but parents are n't @entity13 ' target audience , and there 's no doubt they can inspire a room of toddlers			2
' if parents come away saying that was n't nearly as bad as i expected , then that 's just gravy for them			0
because they 're not playing for the parents , ' @entity157 says			0
some songs impart a lesson - new song ' @entity241 ' is about food allergies , for example - while others are meant to get children up and dancing			0
( the group is conscious of the dangers of screen time , even if they are creatures of television			0
) and for a new generation of fans , these are @entity13 - yellow bows and all			1
' i think that @entity107 music is so well known and it 's so dancey and catchy that the children - it does n't really matter who 's wearing the skivvies , as long as the music continues on , ' @entity12 says			1
having a girl in the group ' means the world ' to the young girls in the audience , @entity124 says			0
' they turn up and all they do is look at @entity12 the whole time , ' he says			2
' a lot of these 2 - year - olds and 3 - year - olds have never seen @entity13 before			1
this is their first ever @entity13 , so @entity12 's their superstar			1

in the @entity27 - coded @entity13 world , @entity12 is the @entity24
on early portions of the tour , she attracted tiny yellow clones with enormous bows on their heads just like her
