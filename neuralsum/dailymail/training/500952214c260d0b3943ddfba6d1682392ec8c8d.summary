their intricate designs and the shear impressive size of them takes meticulous planning and precision execution			0
and the resulting crop circle , while illegal and irritating to the farmer whose field has been targeted , is usually visually stunning			1
but while some crop circles are remembered for their perfect symmetry and unique patterns , others are slightly less impressive			2
a series of recent attempts at producing circles have been been met with much derision by fans of the field art after they recently appeared in @entity19			1
not very impressive : this image of a heart appeared in a field of crops in @entity24 , @entity19 rubbish : the heart shaped crop circle appeared in the fields below the @entity28 in @entity19 how it should look ? a slightly more impressive crop circle featuring a heart which appeared in a nearby field in @entity19 in august 2000 insiders say a number of top crop circle makers have quit following a clampdown by farmers and moved onto making sand circles , which are legal			1
in previous years , impressive crop circles have drawn in thousands of tourists to southern @entity41 and some believers who saw the circles as the work of aliens			1
but this year visitors have been disappointed by just a handful of crude patterns such as a square , a heart and a small uneven circle			2
former crop circlemaker @entity52 - who has given up his hobby because he suffers from hayfever - said the lack of competition is driving down standards			0
he said : ' the problem is that the best croppies have retired or gone onto something new , so there is n't any competition any more			0
' they 're all creative types , and without any friendly rivalry , many just ca n't be bothered			0
' all the best crop circles from the last few years have been made by only a handful of people , and they 've all hung up their wooden board now and moved onto pastures new			2
' bizarre : the prankster 's attempts at a crop circle in this @entity76 field did not go quite to plan , you ca n't really make out what the shape is supposed to be poor effort : this attempt at a crop circle is one of 15 to have appeared across the county so far this year a better attempt : this stunning crop circle appeared in nearby @entity86 in august 2000 @entity87 , 42 , reckons the 15 less than impressive circles that have appeared this year were created by amateurs			1
in comparison , seasoned veterans had produced more than 50 by this time last year			2
he said : ' @entity94 , one of the best croppies ever , has moved on to making sand circles instead			0
' he wants to try something different and i think he 's fed up with believers trying to make money from his hobby - that he never made a penny for			0
' i 've retired due to hayfever , and a couple of my peers have just given up as well - it 's becoming too difficult			0
' the farmers are getting angrier , the believers are getting too demanding and we 're still not making any money			0
' @entity87 hit the headlines in 2006 when he became the first person ever to be convicted of criminal damage for creating a crop circle in a field of wheat			2
what is it ? it 's anyone 's guess as to what the creator of this circle was trying to depict it 's a mystery : even a close up of the crop formation does n't give any clues as to what it is supposed to be more like it : perhaps the creators of this year 's formation was hoping to produce something a little like this image which appeared in @entity134 , @entity19 in august 2000 he was caught after setting up a sting to debunk a @entity138 's claim that he could communicate with aliens and would get them to make a specific shape in a field			1
farmers across @entity19 and @entity143 are also fed up with crop circles and tourists looking to have a ' out of body experience ' inside them			1
some have taken the drastic step of mowing the formations out of their fields as soon as they appear			0
@entity153 crop circle ' expert ' @entity152 tried to set up a pass scheme to charge people to look at the circles and walk inside them			1
the Â£ 60 season ticket was intended to bring in revenue for farmers but it has flopped after it allowed access to only two formations			0
gone : it is thought that the people behind crop circles such as this one which appeared at @entity86 in august 2000 have moved on to pastures new @entity152 and two colleagues @entity168 and @entity170 set up a crop circle information centre at a garden centre in @entity173 , @entity19 @entity87 added : ' loads of the boys are quitting making them now , because it 's being ruined by outsiders like @entity152 who are trying to make money from our hobby			1
' we in the circle making community are outraged that outsiders like @entity152 would come in and take over , trying to interfere			0
' farmers are sick to their back teeth too and are cutting more circles out of their field than ever before - if it continues like this , then there wo n't be any circles at all next year			2
' it 's such a shame , because myself and a lot of people have had a great deal of fun with crop circles over the years			1

just 15 poor attempts at crop circles have appeared in @entity19 this year
last year , seasoned crop artists had already produced more than 50
tourists and those hoping for an alien *encounter* used to flock to the county
but this year 's attempts have been met with derision by *enthusiasts*
a *crackdown* by farmers has *deterred* many top crop circle makers
