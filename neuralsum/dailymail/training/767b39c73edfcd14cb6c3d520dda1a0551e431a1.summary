perched on the northern end of @entity2 , @entity0 is named after a tree native to the area			2
once an historical and cultural centre , a barren landscape and broken down buildings now populate the town			0
also the site of @entity13 's @entity12 artwork , it was this conceptual work that first inspired @entity16 - based photographer , @entity15 , to fly out and explore the area			1
' it 's a case study in decline , ' @entity15 told @entity28 of his photo project			1
' how a community that has so much history can still have it rendered null by the encroachment of desert , salt and heat			1
' ' by tracing a path from habitation to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and finally to the scrubland desert and salt flats edging the @entity2 , the project seeks to explain how history can fail and become meaningless in the face of nature 's absoluteness			1
' as @entity15 researched the home of @entity49 's @entity23 further , the more interested he became in its surroundings @entity15 refers to his @entity0 photographer project as ' a case study in decline ' , capturing how nature is claiming back space as towns stand all - but abandoned the community has been all but rendered null due to the encroachment of desert , salt and heat and declining local industries the project seeks explain how history can fail and become meaningless in the face of nature 's absoluteness for the project , @entity15 traced a path to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and to the desert and salt flats @entity74 space agency , @entity73 , has a site and conducts rocket tests in the little - known town , making use of its expanses of wilderness ultimately , @entity15 hoped that - despite the desolate images - that the project would say something positive despite the desolate images , @entity15 wanted @entity0 to ultimately say something positive about the county and the country , more generally			1
the project conveys a multitude of voices to varying degrees , even in a place this remote			0
' what i ended up finding is that history itself conforms to the pervasive decline felt everywhere else in the country , ' @entity15 explains			2
' everyday objects are raised to the status of relics while the places people live go to seed			0
' small wonders , such as the @entity107 or the world 's biggest peanut , for instance , are made canonical and static by the inclusion of a staffed museum that tries to obliterate anything negative from the record			0
' everyday objects are raised to the status of relics while the places people live go to seed , he tells @entity28 @entity15 found that the history of @entity0 conforms to the pervasive decline felt everywhere in the country although inspired by the @entity23 , @entity13 's vision was ultimately not what @entity15 expected it to be , but he still found inspiration in the sense of abandonment @entity15 also said that quickly ' perception became a joke , ' since everything was flat and white in the landscape although @entity13 's vision of the @entity23 was admittedly not what @entity15 thought it would be			1
' we drove out to the @entity12 on our third day in the country , and like all the days preceding and all the days following , it was sunny , dry and incredibly hot , ' he remembers			2
' @entity137 , the part of the lake where the @entity12 resides , is famous for a botched oil drilling operation , a piece of conceptual art and a pink algae that 's the only that can survive in the hypersalinated water			1
' perspective becomes a joke : everything is flat and white and the horizon bleeds into the sky			0
on that day , after walking the length of the jetty and photographing several dead birds , i began to walk toward the horizon			0
' @entity156 was in the midst of a drought and that , coupled with the amount of salt around us and the heat , made me thirsty and crazy and bug - eyed			2
' more often than not in @entity15 's landscape photographs , the horizon bleeds into the skyline the series of photographs is about ' confronting the effect of entropy on objects , ' says @entity15 he hopes that he 's created a project that radiates the joy that comes with being some place strange @entity0 is sliding into an entropic state and the garbage and weirdness that 's there reinforces that ' really , [ @entity13 's work ] is just a means of confronting the effect of entropy on objects and that 's what the series ended up being about , ' he adds			1
' @entity0 is a place that 's sliding slowly into an entropic state and the garbage and damage and weirdness that 's there , and the absolutely beautiful but incredible hostile and alien landscape surrounding it , reinforces that			0
' i 'd wanted to make the project something that radiated the joy felt at being in a place so strange and different			0
' i 'd wanted to engage with the space in a way that provoked a sublime response , and in a lot of ways it did , although not at all in the way i 'd envisioned			0
