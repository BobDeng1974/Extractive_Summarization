by @entity0 serious sports injuries and disease can damage people 's muscles and affect their quality of life			0
but now there is new hope as scientists have created living muscle that not only functions like the real thing but can heal itself too			0
the lab - grown tissue , produced from immature pre-cursor cells - which are blood cells not committed to a particular use - was demonstrated in mice			1
here , long , colourful strands of engineered muscle fibre have been stained to allow scientists to observe growth after its implantation into a mouse			2
native tissue appears green and engineered tissue red and yellow , because two molecular stains are used			0
the blue marks are the nuclei of cells that have been stained by another molecule it is not the first time that muscle has been created , but it is the first time that it has contracted as strongly as native neonatal skeletal muscle			2
the new muscle contracts powerfully and rapidly , integrates into mice quickly and demonstrates the ability to heal itself in the lab and inside an animal for the first time			2
every muscle has satellite cells on reserve , ready to activate upon injury and begin the regeneration process			1
the key to the team ’s success was successfully creating the micro environments called niches , where the stem cells can work effectively			0
the scientists tested the muscle by stimulating it with electric pulses , deliberately damaging it with a toxin found in snake venom and watching it through a window on the back of a living mouse			0
they believe the technique is a step towards growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries			1
but researchers believe it marks a significant step towards growing viable replacement muscle in humans			1
unlike previous examples of bioengineered muscle , the artificially - constructed muscle fibres contract as strongly as their natural counterparts			2
satellite cells - dormant step cells that can be activated by injury to regenerate damaged tissue - were at the heart of the self - repair mechanism			1
the secret was supplying them with the right environment , the researchers wrote in the journal @entity90			0
‘ simply implanting satellite cells or less - developed muscle does n't work as well , ’ said @entity91 , a graduate student and member of the team from @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96			1
this series of images shows the destruction and recovery of the engineered muscle fibres that were exposed to a toxin found in snake venom			0
the scientists proved for the first time that engineered muscle can repair itself after implantation into a living animal			1
here , blue represents damaged muscle ‘ the well - developed muscle we made provides niches for satellite cells to live in and when needed to restore the robust musculature and its function			1
’ stimulating the tissue with electric pulses to make it contract showed that the engineered muscle was more than 10 times stronger than any previous lab muscle produced			1
after damaging muscle with snake venom toxin , the satellite cells stepped in , activating , multiplying and repairing the injured muscle fibres			2
the scientists watched the muscle integrate and mature in a living animal through small glass windows inserted into the backs of mice			0
the scientists watched the muscle integrate and mature in a living animal through small glass windows inserted into the backs of mice			0
these images show the progress of veins slowly growing into the implanted lab grown muscle fibres a genetic modification causing the muscle fibres to produce fluorescent flashes when they contracted made it possible to observe them growing stronger in real time			2
the stronger they got , the brighter they flashed			0
‘ we could see and measure in real time how blood vessels grew into the implanted muscle fibres , maturing toward equalling the strength of its native counterpart , ’ said mr @entity91			0
both the lab - grown muscle and experimental techniques are important steps toward growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries , said @entity161 , associate professor of biomedical engineering at the university			1
' the muscle we have made represents an important advance for the field			0
it ’s the first time engineered muscle has been created that contracts as strongly as native neonatal skeletal muscle			1

researchers at @entity94 in @entity96 proved for the first time that engineered muscle can contract as strongly as ' natural ' muscle
the lab - grown tissue was demonstrated in mice but it marks a significant step towards growing viable replacement muscle in humans
satellite cells - dormant step cells that can be activated by injury to regenerate damaged tissue - were at the heart of the healing mechanism
