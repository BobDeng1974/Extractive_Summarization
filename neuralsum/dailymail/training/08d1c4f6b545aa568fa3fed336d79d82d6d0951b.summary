sir @entity0 , national police lead for preventing extremism , said officers who demanded the names of people who bought @entity6 in the wake of the @entity9 attacks appeared ' overzealous and unneccessary ' anti-terror units handed local police officers the names of @entity14 newsagents who stocked the satirical magazine @entity6 in the wake of the @entity9 attacks			1
but the decision by some forces to then visit the outlets and quiz shopkeepers about who bought the publication was ' overzealous and unnecessary ' , @entity14 's anti-terror police chief has said			1
sir @entity0 , chief constable of @entity23 ( @entity23 ) and national police lead for preventing extremism , said he was now urgently clarifying guidance to all @entity14 forces			1
it comes after police were caught asking @entity14 newsagents which sold copies of the satirical magazine for details of the customers who bought it			1
shopkeepers in @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 reported that police approached them and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine			1
in a letter to the @entity46 , sir @entity0 said that the move to provide details of newsagents to local police was intended to ' provide community reassurance '			1
but he admitted that officers who then asked for details of individuals who bought the magazine had appeared ' over-zealous and unnecessary '			1
he said : ' following the attacks in @entity9 , there has been an increase in incidents of antisemitism and @entity61			0
' forces were aware of the potential for heightened tension with the release of @entity6 and many neighbourhood police officers , who are well known in their communities , may have opted to visit sellers to establish any concerns and provide reassurance			1
' however , it is important that we do not erode the very freedoms that we are trying to protect			0
i understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary			2
there was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed			0
' @entity38 police have since apologised , while the other forces have denied their officers asked for names			1
the @entity89 revealed yesterday that @entity90 ( @entity91 ) was handed a list of @entity6 's @entity14 stockists by @entity94 , one of the magazine 's @entity14 distributors , via the @entity98 unit			1
@entity91 then alerted forces who had shops selling @entity6 in their area , saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale			1
but while the alert said police may wish to visit the shops involved , they should only do so if there were signs of rising tensions			2
officers visited a small newsagents and post office in @entity38 and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the @entity6 magazine ( pictured ) , which was the subject of a terrorist attack			1
now it has emerged that officers in @entity37 and @entity39 have also approached shopkeepers the advice said forces should review the lists for retailers using post codes , and if there are raised community tension indicators , or a large number of copies advertised for sale , then they should consider a site visit			1
the @entity91 advice did not recommend visiting each shop , and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication , according to the spokesman			2
it would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice , or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers			2
@entity145 , 57 , owner of a newsagent in @entity147 , @entity37 , said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them			2
he said : ' they wanted to know where we had got them from , and did we know who we had sold them to			0
twelve people were killed when gunmen ( pictured ) stormed the office of @entity6 in @entity9 on january 7 ' [ my wife ] said she was n't prepared to give any names			0
she thought we were in trouble for selling them originally , but they said we were n't , and they just wanted to know who bought them			0
' we did n't give them any details			0
it was all very strange			0
there were a couple of customers in here at the time , so it soon got around town			0
' a @entity182 police spokesman denied that customer details were asked for			2
she said : ' it was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded			2
@entity191 can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance			1
' cheshire police also denied that officers had asked for customers details			1
a spokesman said : ' officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the @entity6 magazine			1
' each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we can not provide an exact figure			0
' @entity38 officers asked at least three newsagents for people 's details			2
the force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of @entity222 who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the @entity226 on the front			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity229 are confident that the police officer ’s intention was purely around enhancing public safety and ensuring that the newsagent was advised appropriately			0
' the @entity9 massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world , including the ' @entity239 ' message @entity240 , director of @entity241 , said : ' the @entity6 attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence			0
' this move by the police is entirely unacceptable			0
this sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed , but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication			0
' it is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it			0
considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in @entity9 by world leaders , that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged , the moves by the police in the @entity14 completely undermine that			2
' hundreds of @entity14 queued for a copy of the £ 3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine , published following last month 's attack by @entity278 extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead			1
@entity94 said it had handed over a list of newsagents which had ordered the magazine in the interest of safety and security			2
a spokesman said : ' given the sensitive nature of this product , @entity290 's priority was the safety and security of our employees and customers			0
' where appropriate we consulted with the relevant authorities to ensure the these priorities were met at all times			0
' @entity301 , another @entity6 distributor , has also refused to comment			0
the move has been branded ' entirely unacceptable ' by privacy campaigners .			0
