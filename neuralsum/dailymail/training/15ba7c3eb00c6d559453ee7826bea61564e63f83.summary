when they found her , starving to death and desperately weak , she was half the horse she should have been			1
@entity6 the abandoned bay mare was so underweight she had zero body fat , her ribs poked through and her rescuers described her as the thinnest living horse they had ever seen			1
but after six months of constant care , she has made a miraculous recovery , is a picture of health and back to a weight close to what she should be			0
another mare dumped in the same field with @entity6 had collapsed in the mud and was unable to stand			1
nothing could be done for her and a vet put her to sleep to prevent further suffering			0
a third with a seriously injured hind leg was put down a week later			0
all three were equally emaciated			0
@entity6 , who also had worms , conjunctivitis and the skin disease rainscald , weighed 316kg ( 696lb ) , almost less than half the healthy weight for a horse of her size , 15 hands			1
@entity51 , chief executive of the @entity27 , said : ‘ it ’s a miracle @entity6 is still alive			1
it ’s the worst case of horse neglect i ’ve ever seen			0
‘ we rate a horse ’s weight on a scale from zero to five , with three being a healthy horse			0
@entity6 was a zero - she had no fat on her skin or even around her vital organs			1
’ @entity6 , pictured on the road to recovery shortly after she arrived at the @entity27 ’s centre in @entity35 after six months of constant care , @entity6 has made a miraculous recovery and is now a picture of good health @entity6 now weighs a near normal half a ton ( 466kg/1027lb ) after putting on a much - needed 150kg ( 331lb )			1
but her road to recovery was a long one , and far from simple			0
she could not be fed with a lot of food for fear of her dying from ‘ re-feeding syndrome ’			0
this meant that she had to have controlled amounts of hay a day to avoid being overloaded with calories and her body shutting down			1
her lack of body fat also meant that the treatment she needed for worms could have proved fatal as well			1
mrs @entity51 said : ‘ when we first started treatment it could have proved toxic for her			2
it was a horrible @entity92 situation where we had to treat her worms to stop them killing her but the treatment itself could have caused fatal damage			2
@entity6 , now well with workers at the @entity27 ‘ the treatment is absorbed by fat cells and released slowly over a few months , but she had no fat and it would have just swamped her body			1
’ all three horses were microchipped , but their details only link back to their veterinary clinic , not their owner , making it unlikely they will ever be traced and prosecuted for neglect			0
rescue centres reported a rise in admissions of up to 40 per cent last year , with increasing numbers of horses being abandoned because of the effect of the credit crunch on the price of feed			2
unscrupulous dealers , hit by a slump in demand following the horse meat scandal , were also blamed for the surge			0
@entity6 is now well enough to have been released into a field at the centre with other rescued horses			1
mrs @entity51 said : ‘ she ’s a real mare now , the transformation is unbelievable			2
' she ’s got a group of male horses who follow her everywhere - it ’s a right little fan club			0
‘ when we first got her we would never have imagined putting her in with other horses			0
she could barely have survived the slightest brush			2

abandoned bay mare @entity6 had zero body fat when she was found by @entity32
rescuers described her as the thinnest living animal they had ever seen
those looking after her feared she was so weak any treatment would kill her
against all odds , she survived her horrific *ordeal* and has now recovered
