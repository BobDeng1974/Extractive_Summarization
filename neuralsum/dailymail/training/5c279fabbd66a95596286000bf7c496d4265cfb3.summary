by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:51 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:17 est , 11 december 2013 rumours began circulating last month @entity4 could be working on a curved phone and the firm 's latest patent has added serious weight to these claims			1
the patent describes the manufacture of a concave screen which can be made at high temperatures - current methods involve heating screens for longer at lower temperatures			2
it is thought the technology could be used for @entity19 , a smartwatch with a curved screen or the rumoured upcoming range of curved 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity23			1
it is thought the technology could be used for the rumoured upcoming range of curved 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity23 any @entity4 curved devices would directly compete with @entity34 's @entity33 handset and the @entity35			1
the @entity33 is curved vertically so it moulds more comfortably to a user 's face and gives improved voice and sound quality			2
it also has a so - called ' self - healing ' case made from an elastic coating capable of ' recovering from daily wear - and - tear scratches and nicks			0
' @entity47 ’s @entity46 phone curves along the top and bottom edges			0
the @entity35 and @entity33 are both available in @entity49 and the @entity33 will additionally be available in the @entity50 next year			0
according to the patent , discovered by @entity54 , @entity4 's method of creating a curved screen would involve placing the different components onto a flat surface			1
once the electrodes are in place , the whole structure could be heated and curved as a single entity			0
popular current methods involve putting a screen onto a curved surface and heating just the screen and film			0
this means it has to be heated at lower temperatures for longer , to avoid the screen becoming damaged			0
under @entity4 's plans , higher temperatures could be used which would speed up the process			1
last month , sources told @entity75 that @entity4 is working on two larger - screen curved handsets , expected to launch by the end of next year			1
the person ‘ familiar with the plans ’ said @entity4 is developing a 4.7 - inch as well as a 5.5 - inch model to rival @entity47 and @entity34 ’s latest bendy handsets			1
@entity4 's method of creating a curved screen would involve placing the layers onto a flat surface			1
the whole structure could be heated and curved as a single entity , pictured			0
current methods involve heating just the screen meaning it has to be heated at lower temperatures for longer , to avoid the screen becoming damaged according to @entity75 journalists @entity92 and @entity93 , the two phones are expected to curve along the side edges			2
this would make them more like @entity34 ’s @entity33 handset , rather than @entity47 ’s @entity35 phone which curves along the top and bottom edges			0
reports added @entity4 ’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy , or light , a user ’s touch is , meaning it could distinguish different pressure points			1
the benefits of this feature have not been explained			0
both of @entity4 's new handsets are said to be ‘ still in development ’ meaning they may not be released until at least september @entity113 would coincide with @entity4 ’s annual product launch			1
the rumoured @entity4 phones , which could use the screens detailed in the latest patent , are expected to curve along the side edges			1
this would make them more like @entity34 's @entity33 phone , pictured , rather than @entity47 's @entity35 handset that curves along the top and bottom edges @entity47 released its curved @entity35 phone , pictured , in october , followed shortly by @entity34 's @entity33 phone			1
both phones are only currently available in @entity49			0
the round is curved along the top to make it more comfortable to hold in the hand @entity47 released its curved @entity35 last month , followed shortly by @entity34 ’s @entity33 phone			0
@entity4 has traditionally stuck with smaller screens , and its latest @entity132 and @entity133 devices are only 4 - inches big			2
this is compared to @entity34 's @entity33 , for example , which has a 6 - inch screen while the @entity35 's display is 5.7 - inches big			1
other features of the @entity35 that take advantage of the curved display include what 's dubbed @entity142			0
this lets users roll the phone towards them to see the date , time , missed calls and battery life without pressing the power button or activating the home screen			0
@entity4 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire - based materials			2
@entity4 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity158 fingerprint scanner on its @entity133 , pictured , and to protect the cameras on its latest models			0
rumours now claim @entity4 could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens rumours have suggested for almost a year @entity4 could be looking to increase the size of its displays to compete with its rivals ' larger phones and ‘ phablet ’ gadgets built between five and seven inches big			1
@entity4 announced last week it plans to open a mineral plant in @entity172 designed to make components for its phones and tablet			2
it has partnered with @entity176 , suppliers of sapphire - based materials , and this has led many to believe @entity4 ’s next generation of screens could feature strong , scratch - resistant sapphire glass			2
the firm already uses sapphire glass in the fingerprint scanner of its @entity133 , as well as to protect the camera lenses on its new devices .			0

@entity4 's patent involves a *system* of creating a ' truly curved ' device
the technology could be used for @entity23 , @entity19 or even on a smartwatch
@entity4 said to be working on two curved phones to be released next year
the handsets are expected to have 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch displays
they are ‘ still in development ’ so may not arrive until september 2014
