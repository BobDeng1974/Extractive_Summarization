national dressage competitor @entity0 shares a quiet moment at her stables in @entity3 for anyone with a passion for horses , it ’s as close to paradise as you ’re likely to find			1
not only does @entity10 offer a charming family home , it also boasts stables , a tack room , paddock , @entity15 - size manege ( training area ) and five - and - a - half acres of land to ride on			1
it ’s no surprise then to learn that its current owner is a successful rider and trainer who has horses galloping through her veins – national dressage competitor @entity0 has represented @entity23 and is currently being trained by 2012 @entity25 winner @entity24			1
and the love of all things equine does n’t end with her – @entity0 ’s family are horse - mad too			1
‘ even on my mum and dad ’s wedding day they went off and bought a horse ! ’ she says			2
@entity0 ’s determination to compete is so strong that she has even taken to the saddle with a broken leg			0
‘ i was at an event and a horse trod on my leg , ’ she says			0
her leg was later immobilised with a plaster cast , but that was n’t going to stop her			0
‘ two weeks later i got a letter asking me to represent @entity23			1
so i got in the bath and got my cast all wet and soft and pulled it off			0
i put a bandage on and managed to get into my boots			0
my leg swelled up horribly but i won a bronze			0
’ @entity0 and husband @entity51 bought @entity52 , near the village of @entity54 in @entity3 , eight years ago when they were looking for the perfect place to bring on their best horse , the appropriately named @entity59			1
since then they have resurfaced the manege , making it perfect in all weathers , increased the number of stables to seven , and installed mirrors and floodlights so a rider can always see how they look as they practise			1
@entity0 , who is also a dressage judge , uses the manege to train novice horses and riders			1
@entity10 itself is an attractive and spacious home – the red - brick house has three bedrooms , a study , family room , drawing room , dining room and office			1
and there is planning permission for two more bedrooms and a sitting area			1
‘ it ’s a really characterful house , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ you always find new things , like a switch you did n’t know existed			0
’ @entity0 has to cross only one quiet road and then she can go hacking for two hours and not see another			0
the only interruptions might be steering around a herd of deer			0
yet this is @entity3 , and @entity10 is close to the @entity98 and not far from the @entity99 and @entity100			1
on to a winner : @entity10 , near @entity54 , has seven stables and is on the market for £ 1.1million as well as boasting seven stables , the family cottage has a tack room , paddock , @entity15 - size manege ( training area ) and five - and - a - half acres of land to ride on @entity10 itself is an attractive and spacious home – the red - brick house has three bedrooms , a study , family room , drawing room ( pictured ) , dining room and office @entity59 has taken @entity0 to the verge of representing the country again and she will soon be competing in the @entity120 at @entity121 in @entity122 , near @entity24 ’s yard			1
she says @entity10 and its facilities have really benefited special , adding : ‘ the horse completely chillaxes because of the whole environment			0
’ but however special @entity59 is , no horse could top @entity0 ’s first , a @entity128 called , again appropriately , @entity129			0
‘ he would throw me , take me into rivers and roll with me on his back , buck me off and reverse back over me so i would find hoof - prints on my clothes			2
’ @entity134 : £ 1.1million location : near @entity54 , @entity3 bedrooms : 3 unique features : stables for seven horses , tack room , paddock , @entity15 - size floodlit and mirrored all - weather manege @entity0 rode throughout her childhood and says she used every spare minute she had at school to get homework done so she could spend time with horses			1
and when she and her sister @entity150 did n’t have a horse to ride , they would sit on 35 - gallon drums and pretend they were horses			2
the sisters ’ love of anything equine seems only natural since they would n’t exist if it were n’t for horses			0
‘ my dad says he fell in love with @entity160 when he used to watch her climbing over the gate to feed her horses at my grandmother ’s stables , ’ @entity0 says			2
@entity0 ’s father @entity166 was renting a house near the riding school in @entity169			2
a physicist by training , he used to run a company in the metals industry but loved being around horses so much that , in his mid- 30s , he retrained to become a farrier , and later became qualified as a fence - builder for showjumping			1
@entity0 ’s mother @entity178 had less of a conversion – spending all her life around horses has led her to become an expert on horse bloodlines , their potential and breeding , and she has found future champions for @entity0			0
@entity0 and @entity51 are leaving @entity52 to be closer to @entity150 and @entity178 , who has 35 acres of land			1
they will run a horses ’ yard while @entity0 continues to compete in dressage and train other riders			2
‘ i ’ve loved living here , ’ she says			0
‘ it ’s been the best thing ever for my career			0
