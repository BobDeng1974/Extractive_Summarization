@entity2 , pictured in 2011 at @entity29 , said she had been trying to ease @entity14 's back pain when she gave him the @entity16 patches police initially did not treat mr @entity14 ’s death as suspicious and the court heard officers did not take a full inventory of what was in his caravan			1
because the death was not treated as suspicious a post-mortem was not carried out on mr @entity14 ’s body for eight days - which meant doctors struggled to carry out an accurate drug test			2
@entity48 , however , was discovered in his system			0
one doctor wrote a report to say that @entity48 contributed to his death while another said it could have			0
in mitigation , @entity2 told the court that mr @entity14 ’s death played on her conscience every day			1

his mother , @entity117 , 71 , who still lives near @entity118 , said : ' he was a very good conversationalist and was very popular			0
' he was a keen cyclist , but had a serious cycling accident in his teens which had a big impact on his life			0

' @entity14 never went to university but was still extremely well read and particularly like @entity127 , the author of the @entity128			0
' he was never married and did not have children - that ’s one of the big regrets of his life i think			2
' ' you had been warned that the patches were only to be used by you and that they could cause harm to another person if given to them			1
' even if they displayed the same symptoms as you			0
' following the hearing , mr @entity14 's sister @entity141 said : ' this has been a nightmare			2
