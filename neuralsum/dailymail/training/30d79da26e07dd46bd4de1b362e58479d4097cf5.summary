an investigation has revealed how cyber criminals can easily use public @entity3 networks to access private information on your smartphone			1
crooks rely on the fact many people are relaxed about the security of the networks they connect to			1
while the majority of these networks are run by legitimate companies , they are sometimes created by a criminal who may be sitting nearby with little more than a laptop			2
when @entity30 is switched on , it allows it to ' talk ' to other enabled devices nearby			0
this means that a hacker sitting near you can use his bluetooth - enabled laptop to connect to your device without your knowledge			1
this process is sometimes called ' bluejacking ' or , more properly , ' bluesnarfing ' now , a @entity44 experiment has shown just how simple it is for hackers to suck information out of smartphones			0
in the investigation , security expert @entity49 used a device which forced customers in a café to switch their phones from the establishment 's legitimate @entity3 to his own fake @entity3 without them knowing			1
mr @entity49 's device succeeding in overriding and effectively tricking phones and computers			1
this would enable a thief to hack email accounts , obtain log - in passwords , track people 's movements and steal thousands of pounds in just a few hours			1
the networks set up by criminals are often given innocent - sounding names , such as ' @entity69 ' , that con smartphone users in to logging in			2
a security expert used a device which forced customers in a cafe to switch their phones to his fake @entity3 survey conducted by @entity44			1
how often , if ever , do you log - in to free public @entity3 on your smartphone ? very often 5 fairly often 17 rarely 38 never 37 not sure 2 in terms of security and the risk of people accessing your smartphone and data held on it , how safe do you think free public wifi is ? very safe 2 fairly safe 27 not very safe 35 not safe at all 14 not sure 22 which , if any , of the following do you use free public wifi for ? please tick all that apply ? browsing the internet 42 checking email 33 social media 32 online shopping 6 online banking 4 other 4 none of these 37 do n't know 3 mr @entity49 - who is a vp at digital security firm @entity96 - told 5 news : ' the ability for a bad guy to essentially suck information out of any wireless - enabled device is extremely easy , especially in a public area			1
' i think people need to be aware of the risks of using public @entity3 and potentially the exposure they 're putting themselves to			1
' ' it 's very frightening , ' one customer told @entity44 after they had been tricked			0
' i just assumed that hackers - for want of a better word - would have to sit there for half a day , or a day , or a few days in order to get all your information but this was literally minutes			0
' @entity118 , a security adviser at @entity119 , told @entity120 : ' the problem of people being able to intercept data on unprotected networks is an ongoing challenge we face			1
' @entity3 data between someone 's computer , smartphone and wireless access point can be visible to anyone else using that same wireless access point			1
' there are a number of things that can be done to prevent this			0
one is to set up your own @entity138 when accessing the internet from a public network , ensuring that apps are secure and using encryption while online			0
' he added : ' it is generally more secure to use 3g or 4g networks			2
while there have been some examples of hacks against these networks , they are much more challenging to hack			1
' it 's actually quite straight forward to get information using public @entity3 networks , particularly for unencrypted data			1
@entity156 , a partner with @entity119 , added : ' in our war biking exercise in @entity159 we found a staggering number of wireless networks with nearly a third failing to meet basic security measures			2
' with less than £ 40 of equipment and a laptop it is easy to advertise a hot spot and then intercept the traffic of people whom connect - perhaps even downgrading their " secure web connections " so you can spy on really sensitive data			2
' there are multiple reasons someone might do this , from the malicious cyber criminal hoping to secure financial details or personal information for further scams , or an enterprise offering wireless hoping to use your information for " enhanced offerings "			0
' it is rather difficult to identify a network which is legitimate versus one provided by a scammer and so a better strategy is simply to assume all networks have prying eyes or may be trying to manipulate your network traffic to their end			0
' a survey , also conducted by @entity44 , found that one in five @entity195 access free public @entity3 ' fairly or very often '			2
the majority use the @entity3 to surf the internet , browse emails and go on social media			2
by far the best way to beat the hackers is to set up your own @entity138 ( @entity138 ) on your computer at home			0
then , when you are using a public @entity205 , you can use your smartphone to connect to your home computer , and use its secure connection to the internet to access web pages safely			0
however , this is technically challenging and most of us would need help from an it expert to do this			0
another way to stay secure is to make sure that any supposedly secure webpages you look at feature a little padlock in the address bar , as well as the preface ' https ' rather than ' http '			0
this means that the page is secure , and not visible to others			0
third , make sure that you regularly install the suggested updates for your smartphone 's browser software .			0
