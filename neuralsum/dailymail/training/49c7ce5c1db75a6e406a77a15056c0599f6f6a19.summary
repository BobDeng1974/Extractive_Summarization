@entity7 , reeling after being forced to admit they and their sister club in @entity2 misled fans on both sides of the @entity5 over @entity6 , are having their financial accounts scrutinised by @entity9 to assess whether an attempt has been made to mislead the @entity12 governing body over the full extent of the club ’s financial losses in 2013 - 14			1
the @entity16 can reveal @entity9 are examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by @entity7 ’s ‘ parent ’ company , @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , allowed @entity7 to under - report the club ’s losses for 2013 - 14			1
two particular subsidiary companies alone had costs , including wages , of £ 36.7million in the year to the end of may 2014 , and posted combined losses of £ 25.9m in that period			0
most of their business was done effectively on behalf of @entity7 in that period			2
@entity7 have admitted that they have misled fans and @entity2 over @entity6 city had wrongly claimed that @entity6 signed for @entity2 last summer before agreeing a loan move @entity20 ( @entity20 ) parent company to @entity7 , @entity2 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( among others )			1
turnover to end of may 2014 : £ 347m			0
operating expenses : £ 407m ( including wages £ 228m )			0
loss : £ 63m @entity7 turnover to end of may 2014 : £ 346.5m			0
operating expenses : £ 366m ( including wages £ 205m )			0
city football marketing ltd turnover to end of may 2014 : £ 6.4m			0
operating expenses : £ 19.2m ( including wages £ 5.5m )			0
city football services ltd turnover to end of may 2014 : £ 4.5m			0
operating expenses : £ 17.6m ( including wages £ 7.7m )			0
@entity7 ’s club accounts for 2013 - 14 , revealed last month , showed @entity7 had halved their own losses from a year earlier to post an annual deficit of ‘ only ’ £ 23m			1
but @entity9 could judge @entity7 ’s accounts should more accurately have included more of the subsidiary companies ’ losses , in which case @entity7 would be in danger of breaching @entity9 ’s @entity62 regulations for a second year running			1
@entity9 have confirmed checks are being made ‘ of all relevant accounts and related - party activities as part of [ the ] @entity62 ( @entity62 ) investigations ’			1
for breaching @entity62 rules the first time , @entity7 were hit with a £ 49m fine ( two - thirds of it suspended ) , have a reduced 21 - man squad for this season ’s @entity72 and had a spending limit imposed on summer and january transfer activity			1
city have strenuously insisted throughout that they have done nothing wrong , their accounts are in order and that they expect to pass all @entity62 requirements			2
city sources say they will co-operate fully with any @entity9 inquiry			0
the rule breach last time stemmed from sales of ‘ intellectual property ’ by @entity7 to two companies owned by @entity20 in deals that @entity9 ruled artificially inflated @entity7 ’s income in 2012 - 13			1
when the deals were not allowed , @entity7 ’s losses without them meant a breach of @entity62			1
@entity6 smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the @entity97 club the @entity16 can reveal the same two subsidiaries are involved in the new scrutiny			2
one is @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , self - described in their own financial accounts as providers of ‘ commercial and marketing services to professional sports clubs and organising bodies ’			0
their main client in 2013 - 14 was @entity7			0
their minor clients were @entity7 ’s sister clubs in @entity2 and @entity112			0
the other relevant subsidiary to @entity9 ’s probe is @entity115 ( @entity115 ) , described in their own accounts as providing ‘ scouting services , performance analysis and other sporting advice to professional sports clubs and organising bodies ’			2
their main client in 2013 - 14 was @entity7			0
their minor client was @entity7 ’s sister club in @entity2 , @entity124			2
although @entity7 in @entity126 paid a total £ 10.1m combined to @entity101 and @entity115 in 2013 - 14 for ‘ services ’ , the key issue will be how much of the smaller firms ’ costs of £ 36.7m were incurred on @entity7 business			0
one of the quirks of @entity7 ’s accounts for 2013 - 14 was that they apparently shed 135 staff in a year but , in fact , most of them simply became employees of the subsidiaries			2
@entity9 will ask @entity7 and parent company @entity138 to clarify details of various company accounts in the group			1
certainly there appear to be some errors , inadvertent or not			0
the former @entity145 man pictured in action during @entity7 's @entity148 clash with @entity149 @entity150 was reduced to a 21 - man squad in the @entity72 this season one example is @entity7 reporting a different value for intellectual property sold to @entity101 , whose own accounts have a slightly smaller value on what they paid @entity7 for the same item			1
another example is @entity20 and @entity7 ’s accounts both saying former midfielder @entity163 was sold last summer to @entity164 in @entity165 , whereas in fact he was sold to @entity167 in @entity168 — notwithstanding a strange move that has remained hitherto secret			2
the most logical explanation for these anomalies and others , @entity7 sources say , is simple mistakes , also cited by the club on friday as the reason for multiple misleading statements on @entity6			1
@entity7 ’s various entities were forced into an embarrassing admission that @entity6 had never signed for @entity124 , as claimed last summer , when that occasion was used to sell season tickets and shirts ; nor that he had ever been on loan at @entity7			1
even in ‘ clarifying ’ the situation , @entity7 at first claimed @entity6 had had a contract at @entity7 only until december			1
under pressure from the @entity148 , they then confirmed he signed ‘ permanently ’ last summer on a year ’s deal			0
more worrying for @entity7 ’s owner @entity190 , it has damaged the credibility of @entity7 and @entity124 the @entity6 episode has caused outrage in the @entity196 among @entity124 ’s fans , many of whom feel duped			1
more worrying for @entity7 ’s owner @entity190 , it has damaged the credibility of @entity7 and @entity124 — his flagship sports ventures — and called into question the integrity of his whole organisation			0
there is no specific timeframe to when @entity7 might discover whether they are in the clear over the latest accounts			2
a @entity9 spokesman told @entity16 : ‘ @entity7 , like all clubs which have signed settlement agreements [ after breaching @entity62 previously ] , are subject to ongoing monitoring , and any case of non-compliance with the terms of their agreement will be automatically referred to the @entity212 ( @entity213 ) @entity214 as per @entity215 ( 4 ) of the @entity216 governing the @entity213			1
‘ @entity9 undertakes thorough checks of all relevant accounts and related - party activities as part of its @entity62 investigations			1

@entity7 forced to admit they misled fans over @entity6
@entity9 are now scrutinising their accounts to to see if they *'ve* been mislead
club were found *guilty* of breaching @entity62 rules last season
