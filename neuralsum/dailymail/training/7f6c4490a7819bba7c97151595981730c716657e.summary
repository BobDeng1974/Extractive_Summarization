as she posed in her new @entity2 lingerie range for @entity3 , @entity0 made us all feel even more guilty about our festive overindulgence			1
the 27 - year - old showed no sign of a turkey tummy in the romantic campaign images			1
so what 's her secret ? @entity0 works out with fitness guru - to - the - stars and healthy eating advocate , @entity15 , whose simple tips promise to give you a streamlined body just like @entity0 's			1
@entity36 caught up with the training guru to get his top tips for emulating his clients ' lifestyles - and bodies - in 2015			1
his top tip ? ' stress less , ' he says			1
' try to make some time for yourself			2
book in for a massage or go to a yoga class to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner			2
' @entity15 also swears by the power of coconut and thinks we should all be eating more			1
he explains : ' coconut fat is good for you in so many ways			2
for example it helps with your digestion and boosts your immune system			2
' it can also help you to lose fat if eaten in moderation , since it boosts your metabolism			2
' @entity0 's trainer , @entity15 , shares his most essential wellbeing tip as ' stress less '			1
he explains : ' try to make some time for yourself to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner ' @entity15 recommends eating coconut yoghurt @entity67 as an ' easy and delicious way to get your daily coconut intake '			1
he also advises his clients to add a teaspoon of coconut oil to their coffee instead of low fat milk - as long as it 's organic			2
we 've all heard about the power of kale and @entity15 says the nutritional powerhouse is going nowhere in 2015			1
' eat a handful of kale and spinach ( at least ) every day , ' he advises			2
' blend it , steam it , have it raw - there are no excuses not to have these amazing foods in your life daily			2
trust me , you 'll notice the difference			2
' his final two tips for living like @entity0 are simple and wo n't cost a penny			1
@entity15 's @entity27 plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up ' breathe			1
it sounds obvious but breathing is often something we do without thinking , ' says @entity15			1
' if you can practise the right breathing technique , it will help you to perform your exercises better and it will also help you to feel more energised and happy			2
' and finally , drink more water			2
drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up helps rid the body of unwanted toxins from the blood , which helps to keep your skin clear and glowing			0
@entity0 met @entity15 several years ago and is such a fan that she wrote the introduction to his book @entity27 : @entity122			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity15 knows exactly how i want my body to look : lean , taut and strong , yet soft , curvy and feminine			1
' what i 've learned through working with @entity15 is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things , faster than i ever thought possible			1
oh , and by the way , nobody can get a stomach as flat as @entity15 can ! ' the diet has never been advertised , but those who follow it - along with @entity15 's workouts , which he teaches from his @entity137 gym @entity138 and were recently voted as best in the business by @entity140 - become enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism , making the @entity27 plan popular through word of mouth alone			1
it recommends fresh food , as close to its natural state as possible			0
no refined sugar , which @entity15 describes as like a ' toxic fat bomb ' for your waistline			1
cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning			0
rely on natural , nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant , whether that be coffee , carbs , sweets or wine			0
and yes , ditch the booze			0
@entity170 's most beautiful citizens , @entity0 , left , has been following the kale , coconut and water - packed @entity27 & lean plan for some years now , along with model @entity32 is also a fan in his book , @entity15 explains that he came up with the term ' clean and lean ' to describe the ' ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body			1
' the word " clean " here means a body that can deal effectively with toxins - one that can deal with a few that sneak in ( via a glass of wine or a chocolate bar ) and flush them out successfully , ' he says			0
in his years of studying nutrition , says @entity15 , he has discovered that while you can live off processed low - fat food and diet colas for a while your body will be so toxic that you 'll find it hard to keep the weight off			1
' people come to me who have tried every single diet out there , yet they ca n't stay slim for long			1
' they cut carbs , they count calories , they ban whole food groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food , ' he says			0
' but this type of dieting is a complete waste of time : it might help you to drop a dress size or tighten your belt for a while , but you 'll gain it back eventually because your body will still be toxic and it 's unsustainable			0
who wants to live like this ? ' and so the cycle of dieting , feeling miserable and deprived , losing and gaining weight continues			0
' instead , @entity15 says we should enjoy our food but make sure that rather than processed foods , we eat healthy , natural food and avoid ones laden with sugar			1
clean foods are those that : it 's not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds			0
the relentless , low - level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist			0
when we 're frightened , angry , tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol			0
the adrenalin keeps us alert and focused , while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a ' fight - or - flight ' response			0
@entity15 says stress can lead to tummy fat it also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy			1
it 's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger			0
while this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen , modern - day stress , caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle , is really bad for you			0
it makes you fat , it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness			0
this is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays do n't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from			0
the result is that fat - storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system , eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist			0
they also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going			0
as stress levels subside , your adrenalin levels fall , but cortisol ( and the resulting blood sugar ) stays in the system much longer			0
research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol , giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that 's really hard to shift , so doing regular sit - ups is pointless if you always feel stressed			0
and stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes and certain cancers			0
constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles			0
so stress can leave you constipated , bloated and toxic			0
beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body			1
