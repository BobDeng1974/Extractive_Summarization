the @entity0 have revealed that a good part of their defensive strategy at the @entity3 came from the fact that they were able to decode @entity7 's hand signals on the field			1
controversial corner back @entity9 said that he and his fellow defenders cracked the code that the @entity14 quarterback was using , meaning that they knew exactly what to expect for each play			1
' we knew what route concepts they liked on different downs , so we jumped all the routes			0
then we figured out the hand signals for a few of the route audibles in the first half , ' he said			1
' all we did was play situational football , ' @entity9 told @entity56 's blog @entity55 ( the monday morning quarterback )			2
' me , @entity61 ( @entity60 ) , @entity63 ( chancellor ) ... we ’re not just three @entity59 players			0
we ’re three @entity59 minds			0
' the @entity66 - educated football player , who took criticism and was fined for his self - agrandizing speech following the @entity70 playoff game , later described the @entity3 as ' playing chess , not checkers '			1
victorious : @entity9 got hurt during the game , but that did n't stop him from celebrating afterwards new title : the @entity3 loss means that @entity7 has taken over the title of ' most post season losses by a quarterback ' which was previously held by @entity82 @entity7 's hand signals are known within the league for being one of his common traits on the field , just as the call ' @entity44 ' is associated with the 37 - year - old			1
@entity7 is so closely associated with ' @entity44 ' that 15 companies pledged to donate $ 1,500 to charity each time that he said it during the @entity3			2
instead of his typical double digit mentions , he only said it twice during sunday night 's big game			2
( by comparison , @entity94 reported that he said it 31 times during the @entity98 title game			0
) in post game interviews , however , @entity7 and other @entity14 offensive linemen explained that the noise at @entity102 stopped some of their verbal messages to one another			1
@entity108 's welcome : the @entity0 arrived back monday ahead of the wednesday parade in their honor home ground : @entity9 , who is now on crutches , and the team arrived back in @entity30 monday morning ' none of us heard the snap count , ' @entity14 offensive lineman @entity113 said			1
' i thought i did and when i snapped it , i guess @entity7 was actually trying to walk up to me at the time			0
i 'm not 100 per cent sure			0
it 's unfortunate things did n't go as planned			0
' as for the hand signals , @entity7 is said to change them every game but this time the other team was paying very close attention early on , explaining how they were able to thwart his plans in the first quarter			1
the other problem that plagued @entity7 was that he did n't switch up the system after realizing that it was n't working			0
' now , if @entity7 had thrown in some double moves , if he had gone out of character , we could ’ve been exposed , ' @entity9 said .			2

controversial defensive corner back @entity9 said that he and the other defenders were able to ' crack the code ' on @entity7 's hand signals
said they figured out which plays went with which hand motions during the first quarter of the @entity3
@entity9 *equated* the game to a mental match , saying they were ' playing chess , not checkers ' on the field on sunday
@entity30 won *43* - 8 in a *surprisingly* low - scoring game for the @entity14
