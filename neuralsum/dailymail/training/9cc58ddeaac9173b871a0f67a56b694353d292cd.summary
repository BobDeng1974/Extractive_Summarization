by @entity0 for @entity1 the dream home of a respected architect hangs in the balance today as a judge decides whether it is too modern for its historic neighborhood and should be torn down			1
attorneys for architect @entity10 and his wife @entity11 , along with a council board backed by some of their neighbors , presented closing arguments to @entity18 judge @entity17 on tuesday			1
mr @entity10 had been given approval to build their sleek two - story home in the @entity22 neighborhood of @entity23 , @entity24 almost a year ago			1
however six months into the project , the council revoked their permission after complaints that the design was ruining the look of the surrounding area			1
a decision on whether the couple may have to demolish the unfinished home because of a neighbor 's challenge that it does n't meet guidelines for the historic district is expected shortly a sign in front of a @entity45 home marks the boundary of the @entity47 in @entity23 , @entity24 the clash over whether a modern house under construction fits in with its older neighbors may finally be over after a judge heard closing arguments on tuesday the final word rests with @entity18 judge @entity17			1
it is not clear when her decision will be made but when it comes , it will be the end of months of bitter fighting in the moneyed streets			1
if the judge favors the @entity59 , mr @entity10 and ms @entity11 can complete their unfinished home , according to newsobserver.com			1
however if she upholds the @entity64 ’s later reversal of that decision , the house will be torn down			2
the couple have been unable to continue with the project , and money that could have been spent on finishing their dream home was swallowed up by legal fees			2
' it was very much our intention to design and build a house that people would really like and accept , ' mr @entity10 , who had already dug the foundation and spent more than $ 100,000 on building materials , said earlier this year			1
' it was very surprising to us that there 's been this reaction , as if this is some crazy , modernist intervention			0
' this inside of the home at 516 euclid street which is facing demolition after neighbors complained about its appearance the home has an open - plan design in keeping with its modern , minimal values			1
it could be worth $ 500,000 on completion ... if a judge allows it mr @entity10 's dream home ( pictured here ) is under threat after town planners in @entity23 , @entity24 said its design was too radically different from the surrounding neighborhood out of options : nearly six months into construction , with the home roughly finished , mr @entity10 and wife @entity11 faced the possibility that they might have to tear down their dream house the dispute began last september , when the @entity108 issued a certificate of appropriateness , or @entity111 , for the proposed 2,100sq ft house			1
a few days later , @entity114 , who lives across the street , filed a notice of intent to appeal against the house , that could be valued at as much as $ 500,000 when finished			1
but mr @entity10 and ms @entity11 proceeded with construction , saying the city advised them the appeal was merely ' procedural '			1
ms @entity114 , a real estate agent , argued that the commission 's coa - panel violated several procedures			0
she called the design ' garishly inappropriate ' and said the couple had ' failed to meet their burden of producing competent , material , and substantial testimony and evidence to show that their proposed project preserves the special character of the @entity136 '			0
' the structure as proposed is incongruous to the @entity136 , ' ms @entity114 , whose home was built in 2008 , wrote			2
' it will harm the character of the neighborhood and contribute to erosion of the neighborhood 's value as an asset to its residents , to the surrounding communities , to the businesses it supports , to in - town and out - of - town visitors , and to the city as a whole			0
' @entity22 is an eclectic mix of 19th and early 20th century architectural styles - from ornate @entity158 mansions and mansard - roofed @entity159 , to quaint bungalows and brightly - painted shotgun houses			1
houses in the area sell for about $ 450,000 and the historic district was created in the 1970s , when residents banded together to stop a proposed highway that would have cut through its center			2
although mr @entity10 has built a career out of modern architecture , he says his @entity22 home was sympathetic to the surrounding neighborhood , and was simple in design			1
' @entity10 ’s house is an example of modern architecture trying hard , very hard , to be on its best manners - in essence , to be a good neighbor , ' @entity174 reported			1
september 2013 : the subcommittee of the @entity108 votes 3 - 1 to approve @entity10 and @entity11 's new build			1
the commission , which is appointed by the @entity184 is supposed to judge whether new homes meet the historical guidelines architecturally			0
construction started in october 2013			0
february 2014 : neighbor @entity114 appeals to the @entity188 and it votes 3 - 2 to revoke the approval for the house			2
their justification is that the commission failed in their duty to apply the proper guidelines			0
the secretive board usually handles permits for day - care centers and minor city code violations			0
august 2014 : if @entity10 and @entity202 do not win their appeal - their $ 500,000 home will be torn down			1
in february , the city 's @entity188 voted 3 - 2 to overturn the certificate of appropriateness			0
the panel sent word to city hall to issue a ' stop work ' order			0
@entity213 soon spread beyond @entity22 's borders			2
in early march , @entity215 launched its own @entity217 account , which has more than 2,000 followers			0
its raison d'etre reads : ' i 'm a modern house fighting for my life in a @entity45 neighborhood			0
but no love hurts worse , ' one tweet read			0
' why does that ugly green house keep staring at me ? stop it , ' another said , in reference to ms @entity114 's home			0
more recently messages have become even snarkier			0
' you 'd think neighbors would have something better to do than complain about me , but i guess thinking does n't always get you far in @entity22 , ' one tweet read			1
' in the future , every house will be famous for 15 minutes , ' another reads			0
' i like big [ moving ] trucks and i can not lie ' , it went on , along with : ' i would use this courtroom recess to take a bathroom break , but indoor plumbing is a modern infrastructure yet to be approved in @entity22			2
' @entity246 , an engineer who has been restoring his @entity248 - era bungalow , is one of many @entity22 residents who believe the historic development commission failed to stick to its own standards			1
' the guidelines clearly state that any home , any new construction in the historic district should blend in and not stand out , ' he said			2
' and a home whose very intent is a living piece of art is intended to stand out			0
' many of the architect 's neighbors have complained because they feel his modern home does not sit well with their period homes this is one of the homes directly opposite the @entity215 designed by @entity10 in @entity23 , @entity24 @entity268 , who owns four historic homes in the neighborhood , says the @entity10 house is beautiful , but it does n't belong in @entity22			1
' that is a leap of 100 years of design architecture , ' she said			0
' so that 's not an evolution			0
that 's a , '' so let 's go to another planet			0
'' ' @entity279 , whose 1875 @entity45 was in the path of the proposed highway , likes the modern house but hates what this fight is doing to @entity22			2
' i think it 's been unfortunate ... to have this kind of acrimony all across the neighborhood and have people arguing one side or the other in a very mean - spirited way , ' he said			0
' @entity22 is a historic neighborhood by designation			1
but it does n't mean all the houses are frozen in time			0
' ms @entity11 and mr @entity10 said that what is happening to them is a violation of @entity22 's spirit			1
' you ca n't build an old home , ' @entity10 said			1
' forty years of preservation wisdom show that building copycat homes diminishes the value of historic homes			0
it does n't really honor them			0
' ' and it creates a @entity312 kind of community , which is not what @entity22 is , ' ms @entity11 said			2
@entity217 account was set up in defense of the modern home and now has more than 2,000 followers the posts have become snarkier as the neighborhood gripes gathered steam over the past year ending up in a courtroom battle			2

architect @entity10 built a home in historic @entity22 that has riled his well - to - do neighbors because it stands out from period properties which are valued around $ *400,000*
mr @entity10 had been given approval to build the two - story home in @entity24 almost a year ago - but it was revoked six months into the build
a judge is now weighing up the arguments but has not said when she will make a decision
