by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:02 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 13 september 2013 mortgages should be made more expensive and harder to obtain in regions where house prices are running out of control to prevent a new property bubble , experts said today			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) called for the @entity9 to use its powers to limit lending in specific areas where prices are rising by more than five per cent a year			1
but housing experts lined up to insist it was ' premature ' to talk of a new boom , with some parts of the country seeing steep falls in house prices in the last year			1
@entity23 statistics for june house prices show how increases are concentrated in small pockets , with most areas flat , or falling in an explosive move , @entity8 says urgent action is needed by the bank due to ‘ a growing risk of another house price boom ’			1
it suggests the @entity9 could ban banks from lending more than 80 per cent of a property ’s value			1
it could also limit the number of years over which a mortgage would be paid back , pushing up the cost of monthly repayments			1
crucially , @entity8 said the policy could be introduced on a regional basis , if some areas of the @entity43 are hit by rampant house price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite			1
it raises the prospect of loans becoming more expensive in @entity50 and the @entity51 to act as a ' speed bump ' to slow rises in property values			1
@entity9 governor @entity55 yesterday signalled to mps that he was open to moves to cool @entity43 ’s housing market if it began to over-heat			1
but he admitted that the recovery in house prices was not been enjoyed across every region			2
' we need to be vigilant about this			0
there are big pockets of the country where there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market			2
' the institution warned that if action was not taken to control house prices , ‘ another housing bubble , reckless bank lending and a dangerous build - up in household debt ’ could cripple @entity43 again			1
but the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already frozen off the property ladder by house price rises			2
@entity84 , chief economist at the @entity85 , said : ' the government is already subsidising mortgages in an effort to stimulate demand , and if the @entity9 were to step in and limit house price increases then the state would be pressing the brake and the accelerator at the same time			0
' policy makers need to recognise that we do n’t need more controls on demand , we need fewer controls on supply			0
' the @entity100 has also played down talk of a bubble as ' premature ' , adding : ' we are a long way from such conditions and we do not imagine that @entity9 officials are losing sleep about current developments in the housing market			0
' @entity109 , a property economist at @entity110 , said : ' the conditions are n't there for a new boom in house prices			1
' while house prices have risen slowly across the country , in @entity50 they have surged to levels higher than before the crash average house prices increased in seven of the nine @entity121 regions over the year to june 2013			0
the largest increase was @entity50 where prices were up 8.1 per cent , followed by the @entity124 3.1 per cent and the @entity51 , 2.9 per cent			0
but prices fell by 0.2 per cent in @entity126 and the @entity127 and were unchanged in the @entity128			0
with an average home now costing £ 170,000 , nearly seven times the average full - time salary , the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – could make it even harder for young people to get on the property ladder			2
critics warn the housing market is already over-heating , with price rises in each of the past seven months , largely fuelled by the government ’s interventions			0
grilled by @entity142 : @entity55 , governor of the @entity9 under two controversial schemes , both called help to buy , people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent			1
the second scheme launches in january			0
in @entity152 – where mr @entity55 ran the @entity153 before coming to the @entity43 in july – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan , and 5 per cent on a new mortgage			1
grilled by @entity159 mp @entity158 about what he would do about ‘ an unhealthy acceleration in house prices ’ , mr @entity55 told the @entity163 that a ‘ more intensive supervision of lending ’ was possible			1
one option is ‘ some guidance provided in terms of loan - to - value ratios ’ , he said			0
the loan - to - value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property ’s value			2
for example , a £ 10,000 deposit on a £ 100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent			0
but he added : ‘ we do not have powers of direction in that regard , but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary			0
’ @entity187 , senior economist at @entity8 and author of the report , said capping house price inflation at 5 per cent per year ‘ would discourage households from taking on excessive debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom ’			1
at present , house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year , but rose by up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago			2
still a dream : with an average home now costing £ 170,000 , nearly seven times the average salary , the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder but in a recent report , the @entity100 said : ‘ intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued , unless carefully targeted			0
’ the number of first - time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit			1
before the credit crunch , there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans			0
during the recession , it dropped to just three , but has rallied to 46			0
█ mr @entity55 admitted to mps that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend			2
he said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘ tremendous sympathy ’			0
but he said holding the bank rate at rock bottom ‘ encourages spending rather than saving ’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery			0
@entity242 , from campaign group @entity241 , said mr @entity55 ’s comments amounted to : ‘ spend as much as you can , even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy			2

@entity8 calls for ban on 80 **%** loans
could also limit number of years to *payback* loans , pushing up repayments
would only affect areas where property prices soar by over 5 **%** - *a-year*
bank governor @entity55 says some ' pockets ' of @entity43 see no boom
