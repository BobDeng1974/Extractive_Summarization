by @entity0 lying in a hospital cot , his tiny body hooked up to a tangle of tubes and an artificial heart , @entity1 is clinging on to life			1
it is a distressing picture , but one his father hopes could help save his life			2
@entity11 released the image of his 15 - month - old son yesterday in a desperate bid to find him a new heart			1
tiny @entity1 is desperately poorly in the @entity17 transplant centre and father @entity18 is appealing for more parents to consider donating their child 's organs after death the railway signalman said his youngest child ’s only hope of survival is a donated organ			1
but @entity1 , who has a rare condition which means his heart does n’t pump blood around his body properly , has already been waiting five months and will die unless a heart is found			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it was devastating to be told he needed a transplant , but then you see that there is hope and you cling to that and pray for the phone call to say they ’ve found a match			1
‘ if @entity1 is n’t giving up , then we have no right to either			1
his only hope now is a donated organ – or a miracle			2
@entity1 , pictured before he became poorly , first showed signs of being ill at five months father @entity11 , pictured with @entity1 's big brother @entity50 , four , has issued a desperate plea for an organ for his seriously ill son a heart transplant is recommended for children who have serious heart dysfunction and will not be able to live without having the heart replaced			1
there are around 30 such transplants per year and these are performed at @entity60 in @entity61 or the @entity62 in @entity17			0
about half the transplants in children are needed for cardiomyopathy and the other half for inborn abnormalities of the heart , so called congenital heart disease			2
when a suitable heart from an organ donor becomes available it is allocated to an appropriate recipient on the basis of size and blood group			1
a series of precise measurements are made on the function of the donor ’s heart			0
if it is suitable it will be removed and stored on ice and transported rapidly to the transplant centre			0
in the meanwhile the potential recipient is anaesthetised and his or her chest is opened			0
once the new heart arrives , the recipient ’s heart is removed			0
the patient is kept alive in the meanwhile by the use of a heart lung machine			1
the new heart is rapidly sewn into position in the chest			0
with its new blood supply the heart restarts and in due course takes over the circulation			0
most patients will spend 2 or 3 weeks in hospital after their transplant			0
many transplant patients are desperately sick but nevertheless 85 - 90 per cent of them will survive the period after the transplant and for at least a year			2
failure of the new heart to function well immediately after the transplant is the commonest cause of early death and occurs in 5 - 10 per cent of patients			1
there is a constant although small risk of rejection and a risk of infection in patients who have the natural functions of the immune system suppressed by drugs			0
the biggest problem as the years go by after a transplant is narrowing of the arteries of the transplanted heart			2
nevertheless about three quarters of patients survive 5 years after a transplant and more than half will be alive after 10 years			2
particularly for younger patients , if the new heart fails there is the prospect of a repeat or re-transplant			0
for more information visit http://www.bts.org.uk / ‘ we know that getting a new heart will not be a cure and that @entity1 will have a lifetime of smaller problems , but we hope they will be more manageable problems			1
‘ i just want him to one day be able to go outside , to experience walking in the sunshine , picking up a snowball , things you would n’t normally think twice about doing with your children			0
’ mr @entity1 , who has a four - year - old son , @entity50 , with his partner @entity150 , 24 , said he had issued the picture to raise awareness among other parents about organ donation for children			1
he said : ‘ talking about organ donation , especially when it involves children , is almost a taboo subject			1
‘ obviously it is devastating to lose a child			0
but if parents had that discussion about what they would do earlier then perhaps when the time comes and they are asked the question , they just might say yes			0
’ @entity1 appeared to be healthy when he was born , but at around five months he suddenly stopped breathing for a few seconds			2
doctors at @entity169 in @entity170 diagnosed whooping cough and allowed him home			0
but a few days later the same thing happened again			0
it was n’t until he collapsed for a third time , at the end of october , that doctors realised he actually had dilated cardiomyopathy , which stops the left ventricle pumping oxygenated blood properly around the body , eventually causing it to fail			1
doctors told mr @entity1 and miss @entity150 , of @entity182 , that their son was unlikely to survive without a new heart			1
he is now in a specialist transplant centre in @entity17 , kept alive by a plastic artificial heart which pumps blood around his body			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m so thankful for every second of every day that @entity1 is with us			2
‘ the thing that upsets me the most is that he may never be able to call me @entity193			0
‘ @entity1 is awake most of the time , but he has never crawled , never stood up and hardly ever makes a sound , only when he cries			2
‘ but @entity1 being given the chance of life is more important than all those little things – our priority is finding a new heart			1
’ @entity201 , director of organ donation and transplantation with @entity204 , said three people awaiting transplants die each day			1
‘ parents who have agreed to donate their child ’s organs tell us they gain comfort from knowing they have saved the lives of other children and adults , ’ she said			0
