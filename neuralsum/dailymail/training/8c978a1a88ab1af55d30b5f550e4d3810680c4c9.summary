hours before his final game for the red , white and blue , @entity2 made no effort to hide his anger at @entity5			1
the face of @entity8 ' soccer ' for more than a decade , @entity2 had been counting on going to his fourth @entity9			1
and then after practice at @entity11 on may 22 , @entity5 called in the 32 - year - old forward and told him he was n't going to @entity13			1
@entity2 was stunned and livid			1
he recorded commercials poking fun at his exclusion , criticised @entity5 's tactics during the tournament and was reluctant to accept an offer from @entity21 @entity20 to play a celebratory finale for the national team			1
ultimately , @entity2 accepted and was set to make his 157th international appearance in an exhibition against @entity26 on friday night			1
@entity2 of @entity21 takes to the field during warm - ups on friday ahead of his 157th international the face of @entity8 ' soccer ' for more than a decade , @entity2 thought he was going to his fourth @entity9 @entity2 still says he ' did n't agree with the decision and i still know i should have been there ' in @entity13 looking back , @entity2 thinks getting axed benefited him in an unexpected manner			1
' although i did n't agree with the decision and i still know i should have been there , it was also good for me to say , you know what , it 's not always going to go your way , ' he said			1
' and it took time for me to get to that place			2
i had some very real emotions after			2
but after a while i said : maybe this is a going to be a good thing			2
and i would n't have the opportunity to grow had it not happened			2
i certainly grew a lot more by that happening than if i had gone to the @entity9 and played there , and in that way you can learn a lot from it			0
' i had the opportunity to feel what other players have felt in my career			0
a lot of times when i made a team i was so happy for me that i forgot about the guy who got cut , so for the first time it kind of put that in front of my face			0
' @entity20 sat at @entity2 's side during a half - hour pregame news conference on @entity72 's ' @entity71 ' set , about 20 miles from @entity73 , and maintained his refusal to comment on @entity5 's decision			1
without @entity2 , the @entity21 advanced from a difficult first - round group by defeating @entity77 , drawing @entity78 and losing against @entity79			1
the @entity8 were knocked out with a 2 - 1 extra time loss against @entity81 , and friday 's match was their first at home since leaving @entity13			1
' three , four months ago , if someone asked if this day would happen , i would have said you 're out of your mind and you 're crazy , ' @entity2 said			2
' i give all the credit to @entity20 for sticking with me through some hard conversations and understanding what was important and making it happen			0
' i believe this is a day i deserve			0
i believe this is a day my family deserves for all the sacrifices they 've made			0
' @entity2 anticipated 20 family members would attend , and he said the @entity98 had treated them ' like kings and queens ' this week			2
it helped to alleviate some of his vexation			0
@entity2 reacts as he speaks about his retirement from football during a press conference on friday ' people forget , for those of us who were n't selected this summer to play in @entity13 , it 's not only difficult for us , it 's difficult for our families , ' he said			1
' in many instances , our families had this amazing vacation trip of a lifetime planned , and that was taken from them			0
' the @entity116 forward , the @entity8 career leader in international goals ( 57 ) and assists ( 58 ) , is retiring at the end of the @entity122 season			1
@entity2 played in all 12 @entity21 games at the 2002 , 2006 and 2010 @entity124 , scoring an @entity8 - record five goals			1
his stoppage - time winner against @entity127 four years ago gave the @entity21 first place in its group for the first time in 80 years and created one of @entity8 's iconic moments			1
asked about his relationship with @entity5 , all @entity2 would say is : ' you know			1
' it took him a while to accept @entity20 's offer of a testimonial match			0
' the thought of being in this environment again did n't seem all that appealing at the time , ' @entity2 said			1
' but at the end of the day i looked at the big picture and realized what a special day this could be			2
it 's almost like , if you care to believe this stuff , in many ways it 's meant to be			0
i think it 's no coincidence it 's 10 - 10 today			2
' @entity2 took over the no 10 jersey following captain @entity155 's retirement in 2006			2
but for all @entity2 's accomplishments , @entity5 said thursday he wished @entity157 ' could have done a bit more ' and established a career with a @entity161 club rather than remain in @entity122			1
@entity2 played in 12 games at the 2002 , 2006 and 2010 @entity124 , scoring an @entity8 - record five goals @entity116 forward @entity2 announced he is retiring at the end of the @entity122 season ' i think it 's easy for people to judge others in their career choices and their life choices , ' @entity2 said			1
' i 've always tried to make decisions that were best for me and best for my family and best for my happiness			0
i realize that 's not always popular with people			0
i 'm sure a lot of people wish my career had gone a different way			0
' @entity2 took a four - month sabbatical from football after the 2012 season , a decision that strained his relationship with @entity5 , who believes top players should train virtually year - round			1
@entity2 needed time away - he has been open about his struggles with depression			1
' it 's human nature to have sad periods in life , ' he said			0
' i would much rather feel than not feel things and to go through some of the things we as human beings go through			0
it 's normal to feel that way			0
' he 's not quite sure what awaits			0
attending college and travel are among the possibilities			0
he 'll remain involved with the @entity98 , but how he 's not sure			0
coaching intrigues him , but not pros			0
perhaps the under - 17 team , the level where he first gained world - wide attention in 1999			2
' i would n't want to deal with male soccer egos			2
that 's a headache that i think nobody would want , even though some coaches take it on , ' he said			0
' i think being able to really be hands on early in people 's careers would be helpful , because that 's where i needed the most help			0
