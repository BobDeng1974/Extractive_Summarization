@entity0 insisted his looming court battle with his ex-management company will have no bearing on his golf as he outlined a seven - point plan to rule the world once more in 2015			1
as usual , the 25 - year - old @entity7 is starting his season at the @entity10 @entity9 here on thursday and is targeting an instant winning start			1
‘ i definitely feel like i have unfinished business at this event , ’ said the world no 1			0
last year he took fewer strokes than anyone else but lost out to @entity21 after picking up a daft two - shot penalty during the third round , when he failed to take full relief from ground under repair			1
he would also have won in 2012 but for another two - shot penalty that could easily have been avoided			1
@entity0 ( right ) and caddie @entity30 ( left ) know all roads lead to the masters at @entity33 in april @entity34 ( third left ) , @entity36 ( third right ) and @entity38 ( second right ) joined @entity0 @entity0 posted a picture of himself with @entity40 and the caption ' two best bar men at the @entity43 ' ‘ it is a course i definitely feel comfortable on and , after the year i ’ve just enjoyed in 2014 , i feel like i am going into the event with momentum , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was great to take time off over @entity49 and reflect on what i achieved and watch some highlights of my wins			1
but it ’s time to move on and in practice i ’ve been hitting the ball really well			2
’ as he does every year , @entity0 passed the time away during his first flight of the campaign from @entity58 to the @entity59 by writing down his goals on the back of a boarding pass			1
‘ there are seven written down and obviously i am not going to reveal them publicly , ’ he said			0
‘ but i will keep the boarding pass in my wallet and then take it out at the end of the season and see whether i ’ve achieved them all			0
‘ i did n’t manage it last year			2
in fact , i do n’t think i ’ve ever managed it			0
i set my goals pretty high			2
last year , for example , i wrote down six wins worldwide but only managed four			2
it was still a good year though			2
’ @entity0 is hoping to go even better this year than his @entity78 and @entity79 wins of 2014 @entity0 's swing looked to be in good shape in a @entity83 video he posted last week naturally , @entity0 was smiling broadly when he made that last tongue - in - cheek comment			1
he knows it is going to be exceedingly difficult to emulate a year that saw him win two majors – the @entity78 and the @entity88			1
but he was adamant that spending large parts of next month in a @entity58 courtroom will have no bearing on trying to become just the sixth player to complete the career @entity94 at the masters			1
‘ why should it have any bearing or be a distraction ? ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i literally have not thought about it since i had some meetings with lawyers last november			0
it ’s no big deal			0
i ’m not bothered about having to stand up in court			2
what have i got to be worried about ? i ’ve just got to stand there and tell the truth			2
it ’s no big deal			0
i ’ll be okay at the end of the day			0
’ the @entity109 looked in good spirits during his press conference in @entity112 on tuesday morning @entity0 is both suing and being countersued by @entity113 , and the stakes are high			1
if he loses , it could cost him tens of millions of pounds			0
as for @entity33 , @entity0 revealed he is likely to alter his schedule in the build - up			1
he normally likes to play the week before in @entity118 but is aware the hype will be off the charts by then			0
accordingly , he is likely to take that week off and make the @entity122 event , which takes place a fortnight earlier , his last tournament before the masters			0
‘ it ’s definitely a strong possibility i will play @entity128 ’s event but it depends how i am playing regarding @entity118 , ’ he said			0
‘ if i feel i need to play some more golf then i will definitely add it to the schedule			0
’ as things stand , however , @entity132 is to play five events before the year ’s first major – starting on thursday here in @entity112			0

@entity0 plays for first time in 2015 at @entity9
@entity0 has off - course distraction of court case against former managers
but @entity7 insists he is not worried about court *appearance*
@entity0 revealed he has seven goals this year
the 25 - year - old is targeting masters win and career @entity94
