by @entity0 last updated at 5:47 pm on 5th march 2012 campaign leader : army officer @entity2 , 35 , is responsible for starting the ' i am not a slut ' hashtag on @entity6 following @entity8 's controversial comments about contraception when @entity8 called a college student a ' slut ' over a heated debate on contraception it sparked a national outcry			1
the controversial radio host found himself abandoned by advertisers and was even criticised by @entity19			1
but it was an online campaign through @entity6 which really helped to galvanize women 's outrage over his comments			1
the hashtag ' i am not a slut ' went viral and resulted in hundreds of tweets in an enormous national reaction against mr @entity8			1
and it has now emerged that the woman responsible for starting the online campaign is a 35 - year - old @entity33 officer from @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity2 , who is a company commander and romance novelist , told @entity37 that she had been following the heated debates on contraception and religious liberty for a month			1
but when mr @entity8 called @entity41 a ' slut ' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers ' contraception , she decided it was time to act			1
the second lieutenant , who has served in @entity48 , wrote on @entity6 that she ' used birth control while deployed with my husband so i * would n't * get pregnant & sent home			0
' she then finished the tweet with the hashtag # iamnotaslut which proved hugely popular and sparked a flurry of tweets expressing anger at mr @entity8 's comments			1
speaking to @entity37 , mrs @entity2 , who has two children , said : ' the entire thing is absolutely appalling because her testimony was n't even about sex			2
' it was about a woman who 'd lost an ovary because her insurance would not cover birth control pills she needed to control the ovarian cysts			0
' mr @entity8 had faced repeated calls for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their employees			1
but instead he dialed up the rhetoric , first saying that ms @entity41 , from @entity79 in @entity80 , should film herself having sex and then claiming that she ' had boyfriends lined up around the block '			0
anger : @entity8 , left , sparked a national outrage when he called @entity41 , right , a ' slut ' following a heated debate on contraception however , after a number of firms pulled their advertisements from his show and the president called ms @entity41 to express his support mr @entity8 finally backed down on saturday afternoon , three days after his initial remarks			1
today , @entity96 became the eighth advertiser to drop their adverts from mr @entity8 's show			1
the company posted on @entity6 today : ' at @entity96 one of our core values is that we act with integrity			0
we have monitored the unfolding events and have determined that mr. @entity8 ’s comments are not in line with our values			2
as a result we have made the decision to suspend advertising on the @entity112 '			0
his apology read : ' for over 20 years , i have illustrated the absurd with absurdity , three hours a day , five days a week			0
in this instance , i chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation			0
i did not mean a personal attack on ms @entity41			0
' mrs @entity2 , who has served in the army for 17 years , was left stunned by the reaction her hashtag created when she is not working as a soldier , she writes romance novels with covers featuring near - naked male soldiers			2
campaign : these tweets from @entity2 with the hashtag ' i am not a slut ' resulted in an online campaign against @entity8 's controversial comments her books - part of a series called coming home - focus on soldiers returning from war			1
but despite not seeking a role as an activist , she has not backed down either			0
she says birth control allows her to live the life she wants because she has control over when she can have children			0
mrs @entity2 , whose husband has been deployed to @entity48 four times , also said : ' it 's incredibly frustrating to know that in 2012 , we are still fighting over the basic right of women to be full members of society and not be valued solely for the fruit of their womb			1
' mr @entity19 said he considered mr @entity8 's remarks ' reprehensible ' and called ms @entity41 to express his disappointment that she was the subject of ' inappropriate personal attacks '			1
annoyed : president @entity19 , seen on friday , considers mr @entity8 's remarks ' reprehensible ' and called ms @entity41 to express his disappointment that she was the subject of ' inappropriate personal attacks ' ms @entity41 said on friday that she has been left ' very upset ' by the comments made by mr @entity8			1
' my reaction was the reaction a lot of women have had historically when they ’ve been called these types of names , ' she told @entity168			2
' initially to be stunned by it , and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset			0
' following his apology , mr @entity8 went on to argue that ' personal sexual recreational activities ' should not enter the public sphere , as this undermines notions of ' personal responsibility and accountability '			2
mr @entity8 concluded : ' in my monologue , i posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone 's bedroom nor do i think it is a topic that should reach a presidential level			2
' my choice of words was not the best , and in the attempt to be humorous , i created a national stir			0
i sincerely apologise to ms @entity41 for the insulting word choices			0
' shock : ms @entity41 told @entity168 's today show on friday that she was ' stunned and outraged ' by the comments ms @entity41 was due to testify at a hearing on @entity194 last month about @entity19 's mandate that health insurers provide contraception			1
but committee chairman @entity198 of @entity200 said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused on threats to religious freedom			0
ms @entity41 later put her testimony on @entity206 and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a disorder that caused ovarian cysts			0
the friend subsequently lost her ovary			0
she also spoke of classmates who ca n’t afford contraception			2
female rights activists were left seething and two @entity216 walked out of the @entity194 hearing last month after it was led by an all - male panel			0
ms @entity41 did eventually speak about birth control at a @entity216 hearing led by @entity222 minority leader @entity221 , reported @entity223 .			2
