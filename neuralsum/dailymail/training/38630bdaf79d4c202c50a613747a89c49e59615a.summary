the @entity1 siege has thrown a spotlight on the disturbing growth of terror threats in @entity5 in recent months , with one expert claiming that the country is being targeted because it is a ' soft target '			1
' i suspect that cities in @entity5 or @entity11 are seen as relatively soft targets , compared with @entity13 where you ca n't turn a corner without seeing a heavily armed policeman nowadays , ' said historian @entity17			2
in september , @entity5 police carried out the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country 's history , after uncovering an alleged plot to behead a member of the public just yards away from the @entity26 cafe that is currently under siege			1
it is unknown whether the gunman holding hostages at the @entity26 cafe is a ' lone wolf ' , part of an organised terror cell			1
in november , @entity61 released an audio message purportedly from its self - styled @entity75 @entity74 , calling for jihadists to carry out ' lone wolf ' attacks against @entity79 and @entity80 all over the world			1
he singled out @entity5 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity11 as targets , saying the @entity86 had launched a ' slanderous ' media campaign against @entity61 ' to reduce its supporters and followers			1
' ' dismember their limbs ; snatch them as groups and individuals , ' he said			0
' erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere '			0
in september , more than 800 police officers carried out raids in @entity1 's north - west , detaining 15 people			1
bundles of cash and a curved sword inscribed with black foreign lettering were some of the incriminating pieces of evidence removed from a @entity1 home during the terror raids			2
according to @entity109 , the raids were believed to be linked to the death of 33 - year - old @entity111 , @entity5 's most senior known member of @entity61 , who was reportedly killed in @entity112			1
shortly afterwards , an @entity61 spokesman , @entity113 , urged @entity114 in @entity5 to carry out lone - wolf terror attacks , saying that they should ' not let this battle pass you by ' and kill an @entity5 civilian or soldier — or ' any other disbeliever ' — in ' any manner or way ' , reported @entity109			1
at the time , @entity123 reported that the random beheading was intended to be carried out in the streets of @entity126 in @entity1 's central business district - the location of the @entity26 cafe			1
according to @entity132 , the abducted member of the public would be draped in an @entity32 flag and beheaded on camera			2
this raises fresh fears for the hostages held inside the @entity26 cafe , one of whom has been filmed drawing her hand across her throat in fear			1
the fact that the same location was selected for both operations raises questions about the security arrangements at the site			0
professor @entity149 , a terrorism expert at the @entity151 , said that @entity126 and the @entity26 cafe had been chosen ' because it would get maximum publicity ' and because it represented the spoils of western society			1
@entity126 is one of @entity1 's most high - profile shopping precincts with upmarket restaurants , cafes and bars , high - end fashion boutiques and designer shops including @entity163			1
it is also the location of the @entity167 office , assuring the terrorist of almost instantaneous media coverage			0
although five hostages have escaped from the @entity26 cafe , fears are mounting about the 15 people that remain inside			1
hostages have been seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the flag of extremist group @entity178 , which is fighting the @entity180 government in @entity112			1
the @entity181 reports that many @entity183 leaders attribute the extremism among some @entity5 @entity114 to an event in december 2005			2
a fight between young @entity79 men and two white lifeguards on a suburban beach near @entity1 led to a demonstration			2
about 5,000 non-muslims attended , some chanting racist slogans			0
according to the @entity181 , this mob then ' viciously attacked dark - skinned beachgoers '			0
this led to a spate of street violence carried out by gangs of young people ' of @entity201 descent '			0
about 476,000 @entity114 live in @entity5 , many of them refugees of the unrest in @entity205 in the 1970s and 1980s			2
many are relatively wealthy and have assimilated into @entity5 society			2
the current hostage crisis is the culmination of a steady escalation of terror activity in @entity5 , where all the signs have been indicating that the threat of @entity183 extremism is worsening			2
shortly after police swooped on terror targets in september , an 18 - year - old jihadi stabbed two police officers in @entity219			1
in october , @entity220 , @entity5 's foreign minister , revealed that ' at least 70 @entity5 are in @entity59 and @entity112 fighting with the terrorist organisations now '			1
about 185 @entity5 are known to be involved with extremists in the @entity223 , she said , an increase from about 150 in recent months			1
this number includes those who are supporting such organisations through activities such as recruitment and funding			0
@entity230 , associate fellow on the @entity232 at the think tank @entity233 , said that nevertheless , the @entity1 attack is a ' wake - up call ' that will reverberate around the world			1
' people hitherto have thought @entity5 to be a relatively safe place from this threat of terror , ' he said			1
' in @entity242 the threat is much more serious than in @entity5 , and yet we see this happening			2
a lot of people will be sitting up and taking notice now			0
' a hostage runs towards a police officer outside @entity26 cafe , where other hostages are being held , in @entity126 in central @entity1 hostages flee the @entity253 in central @entity1 , where a man has taken more than 15 people prisoner in response to this burgeoning threat , @entity5 has been aggressively tightening its anti-terror legislation to counter the threat of @entity50 terror on its own shores			1
in november , the @entity263 passed legislation which also allowed the @entity265 to issue ' control orders ' for people suspected of supporting or facilitating foreign fighters			0
this was a controversial move , as it allowed police to detain suspects without charge			0
the new laws enabled the @entity276 ( @entity276 ) to conduct counter-terrorism activities in @entity59 without having to wait for written approval by a senior minister			0
it also changed the means by which the foreign minister , who is responsible for @entity276 , authorises the agency to undertake activities relating to a ' class of @entity5 persons ' rather than individuals			0
attorney - general @entity288 said the orders were not about punishment but preventing terrorist attacks			0
' we 're talking about terrorism here			0
we 're talking about the destruction of lives , the destruction of property , ' he told parliament			0
' once the conduct has occurred , it 's too late			0
' there are concerns that the increased terror threat , coupled with the toughening up of the law enforcement 's response , will lead to a polarisation of society that may turn violent			0
about 70 men have had their passports confiscated in recent months , based on the suspicion that they were planning to fly to @entity112 to join the ranks of @entity61 , authorities have said			1
and on monday , @entity265 arrested a 25 - year - old man from @entity1 on suspicion of financing terrorism			1
it is not thought that there is a link between that arrest and the @entity26 cafe siege			1
@entity319 , @entity5 's prime minister , said : ' the whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves			2
' we have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours , that there are people who would wish to do us harm			0
' that 's why we have police and security organizations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations			0
' in an effort to alleviate growing tensions , 50 @entity79 organisations have released a statement of condemnation			0
' our immediate thoughts go to the hostages and their loved ones , ' it says			0
' we pray for their safety and hope this matter is resolved quickly and peacefully			0
' we reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being , or to instill fear and terror into the hearts			0
' any such despicable act only serves to play into the agendas of those who seek to destroy the goodwill of the people of @entity5 and to further damage , and ridicule the religion of @entity183 , and @entity5 @entity114 throughout this country			2
' @entity5 also used social media to express their outrage , as well as their solidarity with their @entity79 compatriots , in an attempt to counter fears that the hostage crisis would spark a cycle of tit - for - tat violence			2
on @entity377 , the hashtag # illridewithyou quickly started trending , reflecting @entity5 ' view that @entity114 should not be treated with suspicion on public transport in the wake of the @entity26 cafe attack .			1

a beheading plot foiled by police in september was planned to take place just yards from the @entity26 cafe , where hostages are now being held

at least 70 from @entity5 fighting for @entity61 in @entity112 and @entity59
185 @entity5 now thought to have links with *fanatics* in the @entity223
