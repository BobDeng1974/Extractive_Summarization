just right ! @entity3 model @entity2 would past the test , as she looks healthy and is thought to have a @entity4 of 18.8 ultra-skinny models are to be confined to history after the a law came into effect in @entity3 for the start of 2013			1
only healthy looking models with a @entity4 of more than 18.5 , such as the country 's most famous export , @entity2 , will be able to work there			1
the law , approved by the @entity15 ( the government 's legislating branch ) last march , requires models to produce a medical report showing they have maintained a healthy @entity4 for three months before a shoot or catwalk show			1
it also bans the use of models who ' appear underweight ' , meaning advertisers are not allowed to make a model 's body look thinner than it really is using air - brushing			1
brands who digitally alter photographs to trim away unwanted weight from models will have to clearly mark the resulting images to indicate that they have been manipulated			1
the law was brought in to discourage the idealisation of excessively thin bodies following a rise in eating disorders in @entity3 society , particularly among young girls			0
@entity2 is believed to have a healthy @entity4 of 18.8 , at 5ft 8in and 9st 1lb			1
but the 27 - year - old is clearly curvier than some others , and has regularly appeared in @entity46 , as well as modelling for @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
the new law was drafted by @entity52 of right - wing party the @entity55 and @entity56 of centrist / liberal party @entity57 , the @entity54 reported			0
' this law is another step in the war against eating disorders , ' said ms @entity56 , a physician , after a preliminary reading of the draft law in 2011			0
underweight models , she said , ' can no longer serve as role models for innocent young people who adopt and copy the illusion of thinness			2
' she added : ' beautiful is not anorexic '			0
a report presented to the @entity15 in 2002 found that five per cent of young @entity3 suffered from eating disorders			2
of those , 90 per cent were girls between the ages of 12 and 20			0
weigh - ins : models used in marketing campaigns such as this one , seen on an @entity3 billboard , will have to produce medical reports models will now have to produce a medical report before they are allowed to work in the country - but this may not affect many , because @entity3 only has a pool of around 300 working models , according to an article from the time in the @entity87			1
@entity88 , chairwoman of the @entity15 , admitted to a certain level of scepticism over the law at @entity92 last month			0
' as a legislator , [ @entity15 ] is aware many of our laws do not get enforced , ' she said			0
' so i 'm not sure how well this one will be			0
' @entity4 is the globally accepted method for estimating human body fat based on an individual 's weight and height			1
but critics have said the legislation should focus on health , not weight , because some models are naturally thin , and @entity4 does not take genetics into account			1
the issue with super-thin models exacerbating probelms with anorexia is a frequent matter of concern			2
in 2006 , countries including @entity116 and @entity117 banned underweight models from the catwalk after two anorexic models in @entity121 and @entity122 died			2
@entity121 @entity123 , 22 , collapsed and died soon after stepping off the runway , reportedly of anorexia - linked heart failure			0
other governments have taken steps to prevent ' size zero ' medical problems but have shied away from legislation			2
in 2008 , @entity131 banned models whose @entity4 was below 18 , while @entity135 's fashion week bans models with a @entity4 below 18.5			1
the @entity137 and @entity138 have guidelines , but the industry is self - regulated .			0

models must produce medical report for three months before a shoot
their @entity4 is not allowed *dip* below 18.5
advertisers will have to clearly mark images that have been digitally altered
