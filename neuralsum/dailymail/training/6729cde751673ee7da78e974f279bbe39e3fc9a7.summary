this is the moment a rare @entity3 @entity2 float plane was raised from its saltwater grave virtually intact – almost 70 years after it sank			1
the twin - engined @entity6 torpedo bomber was hoisted out of the water by engineers and divers in a recovery operation in a fjord near @entity13 , @entity14			1
now there are hopes the plane will be restored to its former glory and may one day fly again despite it sinking 120ft down to the silty sea floor in 1942 after it was damaged during a botched water landing			1
divers found the aircraft , along with two bombs , which were removed and later destroyed			0
the condition of the plane is considered to be remarkable , owing to it having lain in low - oxygen silt in a part of the fjord where currents are minimal			0
@entity57 : the @entity59 swastika and identification number is clearly visible next to the plane 's rudder recovery operation : years in the planning , last month 's raising of the bomber was the result of sponsorship of local companies wing section : although showing some minor damage to the tips , the plane 's wings appear strong despite decades in salty water after a fundraising effort by enthusiasts and sponsorship from local firms , volunteers were last month able to raise it from the depths leaving it suspended below the surface from a barge			2
it was then transported to the shore in @entity88 by tugs and crane - lifted out of the water			1
before the final lift divers spent several hours washing out silt from within the aircraft to reduce the weight and the risk of the plane breaking apart when it was moved			0
first glimpse : divers and other volunteers take a peek into the plane 's interior through its damaged nose cone propellers : just one @entity105 engine remains on the plane after @entity2 engineers removed the other in 1942 after a botched landing led to the plane sinking crowd - pleaser : local people watched the bomber lifted from the waves by crane @entity115 , 31 , a @entity116 oil worker who witnessed the recovery , said : ‘ it was extraordinary to see plane emerge from the water looking as if it was only lost yesterday			1
‘ it was in remarkably good condition , you could see the swastika on the tail plane and a machine gun still had a belt of ammunition attached			0
’ armament : the plane 's protective machine gun is handled by a worker			0
an ammunition belt can still be seen leading into the weapon carried away : a diver in a heavy - duty wetsuit takes a weapon away , left , while workers inspect the engine , right rare find : the plane is the only salvaged @entity6 - 115 in existence and there are hopes it can be restored to flying condition recovery workers then took the plane to @entity148 in @entity13 where aircraft museum workers dismantled it into five sections before placing it in a freshwater tank where it will remain for two years			1
the museum is already restoring a number of rare wartime aircraft , including a @entity158 , an @entity161 @entity160 bomber and a @entity2 @entity163 trainer , in addition to a @entity105 engine identical to the ones originally fitted to the @entity6			1
crew : @entity167 : 56ft @entity168 : 73ft @entity169 : 21ft @entity170 : 2 @entity105 132k 9 - cylinder @entity172 speed : 203mphcombat radius 1,305 @entity174 : @entity175 : 1 × fixed 7.92 mm ( .312 in ) @entity176 machine gun and 1 × flexible 7.92 mm ( .312 in ) @entity178 machine gun in dorsal and nose @entity180 : five 250 kg ( 550 lb ) bombs , or two such bombs and one torpedo of 800 kg ( 1,760 lb ) @entity186 : one 920 kg ( 2,030 lb ) sea mine remnants of silt and saltwater will be removed during the process , preparing it for further restoration in the same hanger from which it operated during @entity3			2
purchased by the @entity197 from @entity59 in 1939 , the bomber was later used in the ultimately unsuccessful battle against @entity2 forces			0
the occupying nazis then commandeered the plane , using it to bomb @entity203 shipping , reconnaissance and to escort its own vessels			0
the mid-sized , twin - engined float plane was returning from a convoy escort mission off @entity209 when it lost a float on landing and overturned on 29 december 1942			2
none of the aircrew were lost , and the @entity2 were able to salvage the starboard engine and floats before the bomber sank and came to rest upside - down just off @entity219 island , less than two nautical miles from its base			2
of some 300 aircraft made , 8l + @entity43 is the only salvaged he - 115 in existence			0
restoration begins : a worker gets inside the plane , before it is placed in five fresh water tanks to be washed protection : the seaplane was returning from convoy escort duties when it was damaged in a landing accident @entity233 @entity59 bomber : the @entity6 flying boat , pictured during @entity3 , was used to attack shipping and in a reconnaissance role found : the plane was discovered by the island of @entity240 , and will be restored in a hanger at @entity242 a further three ' @entity14 ' he - 115s have been located in the @entity244 farther north , although these have been said to be in a comparatively poor state			1
@entity88 was the scene of an epic @entity248 naval battle in 872 a.d. , which according to most history books was a direct precursor to the unification of @entity14 , and has previously yielded all manner of artefacts from the @entity248 era			2
