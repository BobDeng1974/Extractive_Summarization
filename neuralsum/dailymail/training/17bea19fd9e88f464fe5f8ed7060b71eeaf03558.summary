' he kept persisting and in the end he got his way			2
he had sex with me			2
he was very strong and forceful			1
' the @entity37 was told the sexual encounter occurred during a five year ' improper relationship ' @entity2 had with the woman known as @entity41 whose relationship with her partner was on the rocks			1
the @entity46 hearing was told he was doctor to @entity41 ’s family at the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			1
but trouble began when she began seeking treatment from him in july 2007 after suffering injuries in a horse - riding accident in which she fell out of the carriage of her pony and trap			2
she said : ' i probably should have gone to @entity63 but i had to pick my child up from school and did n’t want any risk of going to hospital so got an appointment at the local surgery			1
' i had mild concussion and severe bruises throughout my body			2
i saw dr @entity2 and i had time before the appointment to clean myself up			1
' i purposely wore green khaki trousers i could lift up so i could show him my knee without having to lift anything up			2
i do n’t like removing items and because it was a male doctor my instinct was that i would wear loose fitting clothing			1
' i think my injuries were more severe than he realised			2
he asked to remove my trousers and i said ‘ no ’ and he respected that			2
' @entity2 later bumped into patient a in a @entity88 store and he gave her his personal mobile number ' in case she needed anything '			1

the following day it was a birthday and she received a @entity109 phone in a parcel which was opened by her boyfriend			2
she then went to see @entity2 for a consultation about her injuries			1
' my suspicions were the was phone was possibly from dr @entity2 , ' said @entity116 ' i do n’t celebrate birthdays and he had made comments about my phone that i could n’t send photos with texts			1
very few people knew it was my birthday			2
' i was n’t in a great position and felt quite rough so he gave me a hug			2
' i did n’t return the hug and that ’s when he made comments saying ' why does n’t any of his patients wear nice underwear ' which i found very strange			2
’ ' i do clearly remember him getting out a bag which contained several sim cards and he said take some of these			2
' he said he was given a lot because he was a good client			0
i set the phone up and at some stage we must have exchanged numbers and that ’s when the texts started			0
' at @entity140 bought her children a @entity144 console as a ‘ reward ’ for a son being brave during a blood test			0
the pair had lunch together and later he told @entity41 he was getting her a @entity11 present			1
she decided that she should buy him a present in return and she went to the surgery on @entity11 only to have intercourse with him			1
@entity2 then prescribed her with antiobiotics for a sore throat to give her an excuse for not being at the carol concert			1
@entity41 said : ' we went to the staff room an he said the cleaners were still cleaning then we went down to his room			1
' i did n’t feel at all comfortable			0
we were the only two people in the surgery			1
there was low lighting and at that stage he made passes towards me			0
' afterwards he said he had to do something on the computer before i could go			0
i already had a prescription for antibiotics then he gave me the morning after pill			0
' he later apologised for what happened on @entity182 eve			0
he described himself as a bastard and said he always put himself first			0
‘ ' he told me he was close to leaving his wife and i was made to feel like the guilty part of it			1
i did in a certain way forgive him			0
' he made about three of four visits to my home during the day time			0
i knew it was wrong			0
there was one time he was around the kitchen table and started fondling me and another occasion he wanted to see my bedroom and take me upstairs			0
' that was when he hit his head on the beam which i had warned him about			0
' finally i was strong enough to say no. there were messages that go on to 2012			1
he would be silent then he would get in touch			0
one time was that he had a pony and trap to sell and wanted my help			0
' in 2012 he passed me when i was on my horse and said something like ‘ nice bum ’ and i text back saying i had a problem with my knee and he gave me an appointment			0
' i purposely wore loose trousers which would roll up so he could see my knee			0
i was with my daughter and the first thing he asked was that i got on the bed and took my trousers off which i refused to do			0
' he insisted that he wanted them off so i started battling with him trying to pull them off and me keeping them on			0
my daughter asked if i was alright			0
' i asked why he needed to take them down and he said he needed to feel my groin area			0
he was trying forcefully to get them down			0
' in the end he stuck his hands down my trousers			0
i said he had n’t even looked at my knee and he said he would give me antibiotics			0
