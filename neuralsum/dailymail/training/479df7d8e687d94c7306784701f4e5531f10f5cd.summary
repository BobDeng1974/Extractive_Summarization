the parents of the innocent @entity2 shot dead by anti-terror police revealed last night they received £ 300,000 compensation from @entity5 – but want more after learning police ‘ spied ’ on them after the tragedy			1
the figure – far higher than previously thought – was disclosed by the couple as they said they would sue the force again over claims that undercover officers gathered private information about them after @entity17 was killed at @entity18 in @entity19 in july 2005			1
in an exclusive interview with the @entity22 at their home , a modest smallholding near the remote town of @entity26 in south - eastern @entity2 , they said they felt ‘ violated ’ at the thought of the police intruding on their privacy as they were grieving			1
' violated ' : the parents of @entity17 , @entity32 , 75 , and @entity33 , 69 , believe they deserve more mr @entity35 ’s father @entity34 , 75 , said : ‘ we are a humble couple , and since @entity38 ’s death we have both suffered with our health			1
we do n’t want to be greedy , but we could really do with some extra money			2
’ mother @entity41 , 69 , said of the ‘ spying ’ claims : ‘ it makes me feel sick			1
they ruined everything for us , and now we ’re hearing that they did n’t even respect our right to grief in privacy			1
‘ there are no excuses that could justify that			2
nobody has contacted us about this			2
‘ they probably think that because we ’re poor @entity2 we wo n’t find out and we do n’t need to know			2
’ mr @entity35 , a 27 - year - old electrician , was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist			1
an inquest jury later found the @entity61 guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation but no officer faced criminal charges			2
details of the privacy intrusion which allegedly followed the @entity35 tragedy were outlined in a damning report on the activities of a now disbanded @entity61 undercover unit , the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			1
officers from the @entity73 collected information on 18 justice campaigns – including those concerning mr @entity35 and the @entity79 case – which resulted in ‘ collateral intrusion ’ on family members			2
shot by mistake : @entity17 the @entity61 said it regretted ‘ enormously ’ the distress caused			1
mr @entity35 ’ parents said they had not been officially informed of the allegations or received any correspondence from the @entity61 since settling compensation with them in 2009 , although their lawyers in @entity19 have been notified of the spying scandal			1
mr @entity35 ’s father said : ‘ we went to @entity19 twice for the inquiry into @entity38 ’s death , and both times our hotel rooms were booked and paid for by the police			1
‘ now i ’m wondering if we were being watched and listened to while we were in there			0
‘ it was the policemen who killed @entity38 who were being investigated , but now it turns out that @entity38 ’s family and friends were being investigated			0
they admitted they ’d got it wrong and @entity38 was n’t a criminal , but then they treated us as if we were criminals			0
‘ i think it is unforgivable			0
if having our son taken from us was n’t enough , they were also spying on our suffering and grief			0
it makes us feel violated			1
‘ we ’re all told that @entity108 is a free country where people ’s rights are respected , but we ’ve seen something very different			0
’ the couple said that with the money they received from the @entity61 , they bought a piece of land and a house in the nearby town of @entity26 , which they rent out for £ 70 a month			1
mr @entity35 ’s mother added : ‘ we wanted to leave something for our other son , @entity122 , and our three grandchildren			0
as well as the rent we get our pensions , but it ’s only enough to survive			0
‘ for our lives to really change for the better , we needed a lot more than what we got			0
but no amount of money could have paid for my son ’s death			0
they could have offered me the whole of @entity19 , i would have preferred to have my son back here alive			0
‘ i ’ve never understood why they killed him without even asking any questions			0
he was a hard - working lad who was just trying to make a life for himself , and help his family too			0
how did he end up being mistaken for a terrorist ? ’ in 2009 , the @entity22 revealed the @entity35 family had reached an out - of - court settlement with the @entity61 but would receive reduced compensation because they were so poor			2
sources said the undisclosed six - figure award was scaled down on the grounds that they could not have expected much cash support from their son			0
although the amount was covered by a confidentiality clause , sources said it would have been much higher if mr @entity35 had left a widow and children or came from a wealthy family			0
but when he died his parents were subsistence farmers living in a dilapidated one - bedroom shack in the rainforest			2
above the road into @entity26 , a sign reads : ‘ land of @entity17			1
victim of terrorism in @entity19			0
’ the parents of @entity79 – who received £ 320,000 from the @entity61 for the blunders that blighted the initial police investigation into his murder – could also be in line for more compensation in the light of the spying allegations .			1

parents of @entity17 received £ 300,000 from @entity5
but they want more after learning police ' spied ' on them after the tragedy
they say they feel ' violated ' at thought of police intruding on their privacy
@entity17 was shot seven times in the head at @entity18 in 2005 by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist
