by @entity0 as he arrived by helicopter to pick up his £ 200million super-yacht , the @entity1 would have hoped he could have sailed off into the sun. but as the 77 - year - old , who is worth nearly £ 500 million , touched down at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , he was greeted by torrential downpours and choppy seas			1
the 164ft luxury vessel , named the @entity14 after his retired @entity12 thoroughbred racehorse , was commissioned in the 1990s and was destined to be the world 's fastest yacht with a top speed of 70 knots ( 80mph )			1
luxurious vessel : the £ 200 million yacht , the @entity14 , set sail from @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , in torrential downpours and choppy waters ambitious : named after the @entity26 's @entity25 racehorse , the yacht is 164ft long and was commissioned in the 1990s in the hope it might be the world 's fastest super-yacht with a top speed of 70 knots ( 80mph )			1
however it has been revealed it can only reach 45 knots but the over-ambitious project has only just been completed and the leader of the world 's 12 million @entity34 has been left with the fact it can only travel at a mere 45 knots ( 51.7mph )			1
originally named @entity38 - it was hoped the @entity14 would break the world speed record for super-yachts as well as beat the transatlantic record he set - two days , ten hours and 34 minutes			1
manufacturer : @entity44 length : 164ft ( 49.9m ) breadth : 36.7ft ( 11.2m ) speed : up to 45 knots ( 51.7mph ) range : 700 nautical miles at speeds of 45 knots , 950 nautical miles at speeds of 35 knots and 1040 nautical miles at 15 knots			1
engine manufacturer : @entity55 ( used primarily by the @entity56 ) @entity57 : six gas turbines and 112 water jets built under a veil of secrecy by @entity44 , it was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts			1
one source involved with the project told @entity67 that the @entity1 was disappointed his dream could not be achieved following years of efforts			2
the project was mired but setbacks from an early stage			2
in 2008 during sea trials , it was forced to return to the docks as it could only travel at 35 knots ( 40mph )			2
according to a statement released by @entity77 and the @entity1 , the project took so long because the mechanical targets were ' challenging '			0
it said : ' state - of - the - art shipbuilding and systems integration technology required to deliver the vessel to specification would have doubtless proved demanding even if employed in a commercial or military vessel			0
' even though the speed has not reached its admired heights , guests on the boat will be given a comfortable ride , because of the gas turbine design			0
according to the manufacturer 's website , it eliminates all mechanical vibration , and counters the effects of pitch and roll			0
in 1992 , he managed to cross the @entity99 in a record two days , 10 hours and 34 minutes with another of his vessels , the @entity102			0
however , the speed of the @entity14 may mean he is not able to repeat that achievement			1
the @entity1 , whose ancestors fled @entity106 for @entity107 two centuries ago , was born in @entity108 , and now spends most of his time in @entity110 , despite having @entity112 citizenship			0
he inherited his title from his grandfather in 1957 and is believed by his followers to be ' the bringer of life '			0
in spite of his sometimes turbulent private life he remains revered for the worldwide charitable works he has directed funds to			0
he also owned the infamous racehorse @entity122 , who was stolen by gunmen in @entity12 in 1983 and never seen again			0
arrival : the @entity1 ( pictured left at the 2013 @entity126 ) is said to have flown to @entity112 in a private helicopter ( right ) to pick up his luxurious purchase slowed : the @entity14 was intended to be a superstar among super-yachts , powered by engines capable of blasting it to more than 70 knots			1
guests will however enjoy a comfortable ride because of the gas turbine design name of a champion : the super-yacht was named after the @entity1 's retired @entity25 racehorse			2
he won five of his nine races in a career which lasted from september 2002 to september 2003			0

the @entity14 set sail from @entity6 in @entity8 during torrential downpours and choppy water
it is *rumoured* the leader of the world 's 12 million @entity34 flew in by helicopter to pick up his purchase
the vessel was commissioned in the 1990s in a *bid* to become the world 's fastest super-yacht
however its top speed is only 45 knots , far behind the intended 70 knots set out when the project began
