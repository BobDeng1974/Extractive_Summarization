by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 11 july 2012 high - maintenance trophy wives , physical attractiveness and @entity4 - type party girls are these days being shunned by @entity6 men in favour of women personality , wit , brains and sophistication , according to new research			1
and it seems both the @entity14 and the economic downturn are to thank for this shift			0
funny girl : @entity6 men look for wit , thoughtfulness and brains in women these days , as opposed to more superficial and high - maintenance traits thanks to the former @entity14 's elegance , classic style and intelligence , @entity6 men have now decided they are most attracted to smart , dark - haired women with sophisticated dress sense and a sense of humour			1
psychologists also believe that poor economic conditions have led to people becoming less materialistic , seeking partners who can provide happiness and security rather than manicured nails and good cleavage			0
nowadays men are least attracted to the energetic , party - girl types seen on tv programmes such as @entity4			1
in fact , 72 per cent of men say they look for a good personality rather than good looks in women , and rather than high - maintenance @entity4 types , most @entity6 men would prefer a @entity14 type : smart , five six with dark brown hair and just a touch of bronze to the skin			1
the research also found half of men say they are most attracted to brainy girls with a funny spark and a classic dress sense			2
interestingly , the same held true for the girls , with exactly 50 per cent saying a brainy chap was most attractive			0
eighty - two per cent of women rank a man 's personality as more important than his looks			1
girl types : most @entity6 men look for a type of woman like the @entity14 , left , while only 20 per cent said they are attracted to party girls such as @entity72 from @entity4 , right thirty - one per cent of men said the ideal woman would be interested in music , 32 per cent would like a woman interested in travel , while 28 per cent are attracted to women keen on movies			1
only 14 per cent of men found sporty girls most attractive - though @entity84 men are getting into the @entity86 spirit , with 18 per cent preferring a sporty girl to any other type			2
only one in 20 men said they are attracted to party animals with energetic personalities , making it the least attractive ‘ type ’ of girl			2
in addition , the most popular character traits in women are funny , sensitive , thoughtful and outgoing			0
party animal psychologist dr @entity103 said : ' the findings suggest that male and female roles are evolving as what men look for in a woman are becoming more in line with what women typically look for in a man			0
' although we are initially attracted to someone through physical features , it ’s now more important to people that their partners are companions rather than ‘ trophies ’			0
' the recent economic downturn could also play a part in this evolvement , as we ’ve become less materialistic as a nation than before the recession , and now seek partners who can provide us with contentment and security ' @entity130 , brand manager at @entity131 , the company which conducted the research , said : ' we ’ve always known guys have preferences for different personality types and it ’s great to see this in our results			0
' it ’s clear that different cultures and upbringings across the @entity6 can make the mating game very competitive within regions , putting pressure on guys to succeed when they meet girls exhibiting a desired personality type			2

@entity149 of @entity150 is the @entity6 man 's favourite ' type '
men least attracted to @entity4 - type party girls , most attracted to brainy ones
