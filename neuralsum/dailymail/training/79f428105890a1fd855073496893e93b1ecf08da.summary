by @entity0 a resilient @entity2 woman has recovered her stolen phone after hunting the thief for a week using an app that emailed her selfies and the location of the culprit			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , stopped by her doctor 's office last week to get a prescription and did n't think twice about leaving her @entity14 windows down -- she just assumed nothing would happen while she was inside for a couple minutes			1
then she came back outside to discover that her @entity16 , which she 'd forgotten on the seat , had been stolen			0
at first , she thought the phone was a goner			0
then a few hour later , @entity20 received an email with a picture of a woman and a map indicating where her phone was last seen			2
' i remembered her because she was wearing the ugliest dress , ' @entity20 , 59 , told @entity28 , recognizing the thief as someone she 'd run into at the doctor 's office			1
' all i could think is how ugly that green dress was			0
' caught : @entity9 used this selfie to capture the thief who swiped her phone , who police later found to be a trailer park resident on the hunt : the app @entity20 used , called @entity39 , sent her maps showing the location of the thief from the moment she swiped the phone as it turns out , one of @entity20 's friends had recently installed on the device an app called @entity39 , which detects when someone is trying to unlock a stolen device and snaps pictures of the thief			1
the app also emailed @entity20 maps of the location where the phone was last used			2
she started posting the thief 's pictures everywhere and even enlisted the help of her local news station			2
one of @entity20 's friends saw her on tv and told her he recognized the thief as a resident of the @entity66 trailer park nearby			1
she went over to the neighborhood and peppered it with flyers with the woman 's face front and center			0
then she waited for the police to call			0
' they just found her ! ' she told @entity75 on friday afternoon			0
' i 'm going over to pick up my phone right now			0
' detective : @entity9 found her phone late afternoon friday after hunting the thief for a week			1
