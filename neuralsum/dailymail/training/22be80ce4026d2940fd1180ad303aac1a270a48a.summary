former marine @entity0 has been detained for psychiatric testing an ex-marine involuntarily detained for psychiatric questioning after posting anti-establishment messages on his @entity6 page has sparked an outpouring of support from protestors who say the move is against his @entity11 right to freedom of speech			1
@entity0 who served in both @entity13 and @entity14 was seized by authorities in @entity17 ’s @entity16 last thursday for posting ‘ ominous posts ’ which refer to an upcoming revolution			1
according to @entity22 one message put up by the 26 - year - old earlier this month stated : ' sharpen my axe ; i 'm here to sever heads			2
' after being questioned by secret service agents and the @entity27 , mr @entity0 received a short hearing , before being detained in custody for 30 days			1
police used a state law which allows emergency , temporary psychiatric commitments upon the recommendation of a mental health professional to hold mr @entity0 at the @entity36 in @entity37 , although he has not been charged with any crime			1
but there has been a public backlash to the move with protesters taking to the street outside the hospital and @entity17 - based civil liberties group , @entity45 , sending an attorney to the hospital to represent mr @entity0			1
@entity49 executive director @entity48 said : ' for government officials to not only arrest @entity51 for doing nothing more than exercising his first amendment rights but to actually force him to undergo psychological evaluations and detain him against his will goes against every constitutional principle this country was founded upon			2
' scroll down to see a video of mr @entity0 being detained this video grab shows the moment mr @entity0 was taken in by officers for psychiatric questioning on thursday night the detainment of the former marine has sparked angry protests by civil rights campaigners who says it goes against the @entity11 thousands of people have joined a string of @entity6 pages in support of mr @entity0 which have sprung up since his detainment			1
speaking from the hospital yesterday mr @entity0 said he was surprised by the turn of events			1
he added : ‘ it ’s ironic , i was considering re-enlisting , i ’ve really enjoyed the six years i spent as a reserve and the two and a half years i spent on active duty			2
‘ i ’ve been very open with the things i ’ve had to say on my wall on @entity6			0
it ’s interesting to me that the government is watching @entity6 in the first place			0
that ought to raise some eyebrows and cause some good @entity87 citizens some concern			0
’ a string of @entity6 pages have been created in support of mr @entity0 @entity0 's mother , @entity91 , said by telephone that the government had overstepped its bounds			1
' the bottom line is his freedom of speech has been violated , ' she said			0
@entity96 said her son , who served tours as a combat engineer in @entity13 and @entity14 , is ' concerned about all the wars we 've experienced ' and believes the @entity87 government was complicit in the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
one of his @entity6 posts , she said , pictured the gaping hole in the @entity107 and asked ' where 's the plane ? ' @entity48 said he found nothing alarming in @entity0 's social media commentaries			1
' the posts i read that supposedly were of concern were libertarian - type posts i see all the time , ' he said			0
the big concern , @entity48 said , is whether government officials are monitoring citizens ' private @entity6 pages and detaining people with whom they disagree			0
@entity123 , an @entity27 spokeswoman in @entity124 , said there was no @entity6 snooping by her agency			0
' we received quite a few complaints about what were perceived as threatening posts , ' she said			0
' given the circumstances with the things that have gone on in the country with some of these mass shootings , it would be horrible for law enforcement not to pay attention to complaints			0
' campaigners have taken to the streets to protest against mr @entity0 's detainment @entity48 said some of the posts in question were made on a closed @entity6 page that @entity0 had recently created so he questioned whether anyone from the public would have complained about them			1
' @entity149 ' facebook pages have drawn significant interest , and other internet sites had numerous comments from people outraged by the veteran 's detention			0
@entity0 's supporters characterized the detention as an arrest , complaining he was handcuffed and whisked away in a police cruiser without being served a warrant or read his rights			1
but authorities say it was n't an arrest because @entity0 does n't face criminal charges			2
colonel @entity165 , the county police chief , said @entity0 was taken into custody upon the recommendation of mental health crisis intervention workers			2
he said the action was taken under the state 's emergency custody statute , which allows a magistrate to order the civil detention and psychiatric evaluation of a person who is considered potentially dangerous			0
he said @entity0 was handcuffed because he resisted officers ' attempts to take him into custody .			2
