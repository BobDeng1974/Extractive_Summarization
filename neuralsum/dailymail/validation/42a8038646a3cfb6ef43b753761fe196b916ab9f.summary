a @entity1 mother and father under investigation for letting their two young children walk a mile home from the park alone have been found responsible for ' unsubstantiated ' child neglect			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , were thrust into the national spotlight just before @entity15 when police found @entity17 , 10 and @entity18 , six , wandering the sidewalk on their own			1
the decision by @entity21 means that the @entity21 will keep a file on the @entity10 's open for at least five years but @entity9 and @entity10 have said they will continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences			1
the @entity31 have deemed them responsible for ' unsubstantiated ' child neglect for allowing their kids to walk home alone from the park before @entity15 unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to them			1
free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			2
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			1
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
it usually comes when the @entity21 has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action			1
this seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the @entity10 's , who both work as scientists , furious			2
incensed by the ruling of the @entity21 , the @entity10 's have said they will continue to allow their two young children to walk unsupervised and reject any suggestions they are bad parents - claiming that giving their children independence is their right as parents			1
' we do n’t feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start , much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect , ' said @entity28 , who confirmed to the @entity95 that she and her husband are to appeal the decision			1
' what will happen next time ? ' she said			0
' we do n’t know if we will get caught in this kafkaesque loop again			0
' indeed , the @entity10 's confirmed that they will ignore the @entity21 and carry on allowing their children independence that most parents would be terrified to grant their own kids			1
back on december 20 , police in @entity106 picked up @entity17 and @entity18 walking home on a saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it			1
guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the @entity10 's make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street defiant : @entity9 and @entity10 have said that they will continue to bring up their children as she sees fit the @entity10 's told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well			1
the @entity21 sent the @entity124 's a letter on february 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the @entity95 they would not be commenting on the process			2
@entity28 does n't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence			2
' we 're just doing what our parents did			0
it was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago , ' she said on today in january			0
@entity10 admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before , but says she was n't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues			2
' well i 've walked home from school before			0
not with my sister , but i 've done it alone , ' 10 - year - old @entity17 said			0
' we walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block			0
the @entity152 describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world			1
both parents are highly educated			0
@entity10 is a @entity163 at @entity164 and @entity9 is an oceanographer			1
usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads ' i 'm not lost			0
i 'm a free range kid ' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house			2
asked what the @entity21 would do the next time they are called , they said they would simply follow procedure			2
what 's wrong ? @entity28 ( right ) appeared on the today show in january with her 10 - year - old son @entity17 ( center ) and 6 - year - old daughter @entity18 about a month after @entity21 launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone parenting choice : mrs @entity28 ( pictured ) says she and husband @entity10 often let their children @entity17 , ten , and @entity18 , six , walk alone to teach them about the world journey : on december 20 , the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents ' if we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen , we are required to investigate			1
our goal is the safety of children , always , ' said @entity208 , spokeswoman for the @entity1 @entity209 to the @entity95			0
the @entity10 's espouse the current ' free - range ' parenting trend , first popularized in 2008 by @entity212 journalist @entity211 , in a piece entitled ' why i let my 9 - year - @entity215			1
' she was railing against helicopter parenting and speaking to the @entity95 said that she was appalled by the ruling against the @entity124 's			0
' the go - to narrative in the last 20 or 30 years for parents was , ‘ take your eyes off your kid for even a second and he ’ll be snatched			2
’ what the @entity10 case did was pivot the story to : ‘ give your kid one second of freedom and the government will arrest you			2
’ speaking about her horror at the decision , @entity28 said she turned to her husband and felt humiliated			0
' i was kind of horrified , ' she said			0
' you try as a parent to do what ’s right			0
even though i know they are wrong , it ’s a painful judgment			0

@entity9 and @entity10 *notified* of @entity21 decision late last month
@entity21 said the two were responsible for ' unsubstantiated ' child neglect
they will be on file at the government agency for at least five years
on december 20 police were called after @entity28 's children were spotted alone , walking about a mile home from the park
parents believe in the concept of ' free - range ' parenting which encourages independence
