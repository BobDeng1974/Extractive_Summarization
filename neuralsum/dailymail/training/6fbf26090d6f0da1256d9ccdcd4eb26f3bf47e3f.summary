published : 04:37 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 3 april 2013 a £ 16 computer designed to help children learn how to write code has sold out across the @entity3 within hours			1
the @entity4 , manufactured in @entity5 just outside @entity6 , has become a huge hit among both children and adults since in launched across @entity10 in february			1
the gadget went on sale on monday in the @entity3 through retailer @entity13 , but the cheapest version , costing just £ 16 ( £ 25 ) is already out of stock			2
the @entity4 model b low cost computer , which has sold out within hours in the @entity3 - and has already sold a million across @entity10 the @entity4 is a tiny no - frills computer that was designed to get children interesting in the nuts and bolts of computing			1
costing just £ 16 , it comes with a processor that uses the arm architecture , a @entity26 technology that is particularly good for small , light battery - operated devices			2
the @entity4 arrives without a case or any other peripherals : you have to add a keyboard and mouse , and plug it into a computer screen or your tv			1
you also have to load the operating system yourself			0
it can run a special version - or ' distro ' - of @entity39 , the open - source operating system , called @entity41			0
there 's even a version of @entity45 's android for the @entity4			0
the @entity47 version of the computer , which only costs £ 16 ( $ 25 ) , has @entity49 of @entity50 , a single usb 2.0 socket , an @entity51 , sd card , and 3.5 audio sockets , but no @entity55 port			1
the £ 22 ( $ 35 ) @entity56 has @entity57 of @entity50 , two usb 2.0 sockets and an @entity55			0
the tiny gadget has already sold a million units in @entity10 , and its creators hope it will become a global hit			1
co-founder @entity63 , who says his job is like getting paid to play with digital @entity65 all day , says the @entity66 initially planned a run of only 10,000 when it was launched in 2009			0
' the fact we have sold out in the @entity3 is very satisfying , ' he told @entity70			1
‘ we did not set this up to sell computers , we set it up because we realised since the @entity75 and @entity76 young people have fewer opportunities to learn to programme computers , ’ he said			1
the firm also recently moved production back to the @entity26			0
' we are manufacturing in @entity5 , in @entity81 , at the @entity82 , after we discovered we could build at the same cost in the @entity26 , ' said @entity63			0
' we 're building a few thousand a week of the cheaper version , compared to tens of thousand of the more expensive model , but we may change that now , ' he said			0
' it turns out people are very enthusiastic and demand has been satisfying high			0
' the co-founders had the idea after meeting at @entity92			0
the low - cost computer – available as a £ 16 or £ 22 model – plugs into a tv and has ports for a keyboard and mouse			1
' the idea behind a tiny and cheap computer for kids came in 2006 , when @entity63 and his colleagues at the @entity92 ’s @entity104 , including @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , became concerned about the year - on - year decline in the numbers and skills levels of the @entity112 students applying to read @entity113 in each academic year , ' the firm says on its website			1
it has been hailed across the industry as a key way to attract students to programming			1
how the @entity4 works earlier this year the @entity66 announced more than 15,000 children in the @entity26 will be given one of their iconic microcomputers for free , thanks to a donation from @entity125			0
@entity126 , executive chairman , @entity45 , said : ' @entity26 ’s innovators and entrepreneurs have changed the world - the telephone , television and computers were all invented here			0
' we 've been working to encourage the next generation of computer scientists and we hope this donation of @entity4 ’s to @entity26 school pupils will help drive a new wave of innovation			2
' despite technology being one of the world ’s fastest growing industries , the teaching of computer science in schools has been in decline			2
over the last decade , the number of people studying computer science in the @entity26 dropped by 23 % at undergraduate level , and by 34 % at graduate level			2
this at a time when the @entity26 needs more computer scientists than ever .			2

credit card sized computer has already sold a million in @entity10 since being released in february
designed to help students learn how to write computer code
