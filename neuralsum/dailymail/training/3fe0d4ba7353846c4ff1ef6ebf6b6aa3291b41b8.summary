it 's an adage as old as time itself : if you want something to taste really delicious , dump it in a vat of boiling hot oil			2
at least , that 's always been true when it comes to cooking doughnuts , those sinfully decadent deep - fried cakes stuffed with jam and cream and toffee and goo and whatnot , averaging about 18g of fat per individual treat - an enormous 90 per cent of the recommended daily fat allowance for a woman			1
one ( moderately ) health - conscious @entity18 artisan chef has taken it upon himself to reduce the fat content in doughnuts without reducing the taste experience			1
and @entity23 , creator of @entity24 , has started by cutting out the deep - fat frying altogether , choosing to bake his scrumptious morsels instead			1
healthy treat ? @entity29 doughnuts are baked instead of fried so have a reduced fat content compared to regular deep - fried doughnuts @entity32 gobble : @entity34 's @entity33 samples a @entity29 croissant doughnut , left , just one of the many flavours produced by the @entity40 - based brand , right speaking to @entity41 , @entity23 , who used to work for @entity43 , said : ' i 've been trying to create the world 's best doughnut since 1997 , but you ca n't just think about flavour , you need to also think about ethics : what people should be eating , and what they should be letting their kids eat			1
the @entity54 : baked croissant doughnut with chocolate buttercream with a chocolate @entity58 : @entity60 - infused buttercream with pistachio on @entity62 : @entity63 preserve with homemade buttercream and fresh @entity65 : coconut cream and chocolate @entity66 : raspberry preserve with subtle layer of caster sugar and neige @entity71 : chocolate ganache and hazelnut ; complete with almond @entity76 brûlée : crème brûlée with crunchy caramel and crème @entity79 : complete with strawberry puree @entity81 : @entity84 puree with custard and @entity86 setting with digestive biscuit topping @entity89 's @entity88 @entity29 : @entity91 doughnut with buttercream and @entity93 with glaze ' since we bake rather than fry you 've already halved the fat content of a regular doughnut			1
' obviously we then add things like cream and jam and chocolate which bump up the calories and fat , but it will always be lower in fat than a doughnut that 's been floating in hot oil for a couple of minutes			1
we do n't even own a deep - fat fryer ! ' our jam doughnuts will have around 6g of fat in them as opposed to the equivalent deep - fried ones which will have about 18g			1
and about 350kcal compared to about 450			0
' he continued : ' the thing is , we 're all adults			0
we want to give people choice			0
but if you 're going to have a treat , make it a really fabulous one			0
' the team at @entity29 is comprised entirely of trained pastry chefs , and all ingredients are fresh and natural : a strawberry creme doughnut contains fresh fruit rather than e-numbers and strawberry flavouring			1
' we make everything from scratch with a baking process we 've developed over the past 10 years			0
' @entity29 come in regular doughnut and croissant doughnut varieties , but @entity23 insists he is n't jumping on the cronut bandwagon			1
' the concept of a croissant doughnut has been around for years - just think of the yum yum			2
it 's only the clever name " cronut " that is actually new			2
' one of our doughnuts - @entity89 's @entity88 @entity29 - is a big yum yum filled with buttercream and dulce de leche caramel with a glaze			1
it was especially commissioned for @entity149 when he asked for one			0
' zebra : the chocolate and plain croissant layered treat is one of the brand 's signature doughnuts the @entity156 will be open at @entity157 , in @entity158 , east @entity33 , from the 25 february			1
the baked doughnuts will be made freshly on a daily basis and will be sold on a first come basis			0
the current pop - up @entity156 at @entity163 is open all week until this sunday			0
the doughnuts have been selling out every day around 3pm			0
traditional @entity166 - style doughnuts cost £ 1.80 each , £ 6 for a box of six			0
@entity29 baked croissant doughnuts are £ 3 each or two for £ 5			1
@entity169 : @entity29 's pop - up doughnut shop is open in the @entity173 shopping centre until this sunday reducing the fat content in something renowned for its devilishly high lard - count seldom turns out well			1
low - fat crisps are toe - curlingly cardboardy , fat - free cheese has the texture of aged rubber , and mayonnaise without fat tastes more like craft glue than anything you 'd fancy putting in a sandwich			2
so what about doughnuts ? would removing the final cooking step - namely , ' deep - fry until outer pastry layer is crackling - crisp , and inside has absorbed just enough oil to soften slightly ' - be the kiss - of - death for this @entity194 ? @entity34 took a box of @entity29 into the lab ( read : back office ) to do the all - important taste test ...			1
gooey : @entity29 doughnuts come in a number of different flavours and are decorated with everything from custard filling to sugar glaze @entity33 : ' i 'm not a huge fan of doughnuts , and these " healthy " versions definitely did n't change my mind			1
they were still coated in sugar - and we all know that 's the real bad guy when it comes to ingredients			2
' plus , mine was stuffed cream			0
since when are cream and sugar healthy ? at least if they 'd put some apple sauce in there it would have seemed healthy			0
for 300 calories i would much rather have six apples , or even three @entity227 bars			0
' @entity228 : ' they may not be deep - fried , but these delicious little calorific cretins are anything but " healthy "			2
while they do perhaps taste marginally less oily than other big - name doughnut brands , flaky butter pastry , whipped cream , fudge sauce , nuts , jam and icing sugar , do not a happy nutritionist make			2
' nonetheless , that did n't stop me demolishing two of the insanely decadent blighters			0
ignore the health aspect and enjoy @entity29 for what they are : indulgent , cronut - style treats			2
' @entity248 : ' i 'm not a big doughnut fan , but one that promises all the flavour without the guilt was too tempting not to try			2
i could n't tell the difference between this one and a regular calorie - laden one ! ' @entity255 : ' my first experience of a @entity29 's cronut was a delicious if messy one			1
filled with cream , you 'd think it would require a good few days on the treadmill to burn off			0
but if each one is really under 300 calories it 's the equivalent of two @entity267 bars - and i know which i 'd rather			0
' the downside ? a hole in the centre of a cream - filled cake just creates more opportunities for spillage			0
it may be less calorific than your average doughnut , but scooping cream off your lap is not the most sophisticated of looks			0
' celebrity fan : @entity283 diver @entity282 , here pictured with @entity29 's creator @entity23 popped in to @entity169 to sample the doughnuts			1
