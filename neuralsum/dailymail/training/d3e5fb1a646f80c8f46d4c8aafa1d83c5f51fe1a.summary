@entity1 chairman @entity0 said it was a ' great honour ' to be launching the @entity4 fourth round weekend on prime - time terrestrial tv after the @entity7 chose the tie at home to @entity10 for a friday night live broadcast			1
it will be viewed by millions at home in the @entity14 and many more around the world , but the problem for @entity18 @entity17 is the unfamiliar logistical test of ticketing a high - demand game at the @entity21 with its 8,000 capacity and out - dated facilities			1
' we could sell the stadium out ten times over , ' said @entity0			1
@entity17 manager @entity27 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) celebrate the club 's promotion at @entity30 @entity1 players also celebrate @entity33 success at @entity30 last season @entity35 is one of a host of @entity10 stars who may feature against @entity17 in the @entity4 fourth round ' we have a few things to sort out quickly			1
we only have one room for hospitality , the toilet blocks are from the 1950s and the stadium is quite an odd shape			0
' the biggest challenge is to make sure the people who come on a regular basis get tickets			0
' to be deemed such an attractive fixture that it will be live on tv at eight o ' clock on a friday is an honour			2
' no doubt it will go around the world and hopefully it can be a good showcase for @entity18 football			0
' people might be surprised by the standard and it might even help us to increase our season ticket sales			0
' the @entity21 - home of @entity18 side @entity1 the tunnel where the @entity17 and @entity10 players will line up prior to the @entity4 fourth round @entity17 are desperate for a new ground and will hope the tv exposure chimes with local authorities which have complicated the club 's attempts to revamp the @entity21 or move to a new site			1
the live @entity7 ties in the third round – @entity77 v @entity76 and @entity79 v @entity78 – both attracted peak television audiences of more than 6.5million			2
@entity10 's win at @entity82 on @entity83 attracted up to 1.2m viewers			0
teams will receive £ 144,000 from the @entity4 in television money and £ 90,000 from the prize money fund if they get no further than the fourth round			1
the view of the terrace at the @entity21 which will be packed to the rafters @entity17 will kick - off the fourth round on friday , january 23 ( 7.55pm )			1
the other live @entity7 game will be on the sunday ( 2pm ) , featuring replay winners @entity94 or @entity96 v @entity98 v @entity97			2
@entity83 will screen @entity78 v @entity99 ( saturday , kick - off 5.30pm ) , @entity100 v @entity77 ( sunday , kick - off 4pm ) and @entity102 v @entity101 ( monday 26th kick - off 8pm )			0
@entity104 will show @entity106 v @entity105 live on saturday 24th kick - off 12.45pm			0
as this is on regional television , each club is paid £ 48,000 rather than the £ 144,000 for a national broadcast			0
third - round replays selected for live broadcast are @entity97 v @entity98 on @entity83 next tuesday and @entity112 v @entity113 on the @entity7 the following night			1
