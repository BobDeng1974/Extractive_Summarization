in the video address , shown to the @entity16 on @entity17 , prince @entity15 said : ' i have watched in despair at how slow progress has sometimes been and how the outright , sceptical reluctance by some to engage with the critical issues of our day have often slowed that progress to a standstill			1
strong words : prince @entity15 made the comments in a pre-recorded video address at a @entity8 sustainability conference in @entity16 , @entity9 ' already levels of @entity32 have exceeded 400 parts per million ; 450 parts per million is the tipping point we have to avoid so every day of delay threatens to make the change more dramatic			1
' he added that scientific evidence shows the potential consequences and warned we can no longer ignore the risk			2
he said : ' one thing is clear			2
we need to be much more informed about the actual state of the planet			0
we do not have nearly enough knowledge on which to base the decisions that will be the best for the long term			0
' until we do , we expose ourselves to the mounting danger of major shifts in policy that are not well conceived , but come as panicked responses to crises that could have been avoided			0
' greener : plants in the @entity59 region are growing greener and taller as a result of global warming , scientists claim pointing to the work of his @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , a foundation set up to campaign on global sustainability , prince @entity15 said a better picture of environmental problems was needed before effective policy could be implemented			1
he said data on energy , water , biodiversity , forestry and soil , which is collected separately , needed to be combined and and analysed as a whole			0

prince @entity15 added : ' we do not have long to capture such a comprehensive picture , and so i would appeal to you as you meet here in @entity16 to make an even greater and concerted effort to persuade policy and decision - makers to act before it is finally too late			1
' @entity16 ( the @entity87 ) takes place this week in @entity89 , @entity9 and marks the 20th anniversary of the 1992 @entity91 , in @entity89			1
