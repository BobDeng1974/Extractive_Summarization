by @entity0 the bizarre way a lizard breathes could make it more likely to survive natural disasters capable of wiping out other species			1
this is according to a @entity8 study that revealed the savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one - way loop			1
the finding is surprising because the unidirectional airflow of birds was thought to have evolved due to the high - oxygen demands of flight			1
the bizarre way a lizard breathes could make it more likely to survive natural disasters capable of wiping out other species			1
this is according to a recent @entity8 study that revealed the savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one - way loop researchers at the @entity26 suggest the trait in lizards may have been an adaptation to lower oxygen levels on ancient @entity31			1
for instance , during the early @entity34 era 250 million years ago , oxygen made up 12 per cent of air compared with 21 per cent today			1
‘ it might explain something about why monitor lizards are so successful , ’ @entity37 , a biologist at @entity38 told @entity39 at @entity40			2
‘ who knows when the next asteroid hits , maybe monitor lizards will inherit the @entity31			1
’ the upper image is a colourised ct scan showing different airways in the lung of a monitor lizard			2
the bottom image shows how air flows in a mostly one - way loop through the lizard 's lung , as measured by sensors implanted as part of a @entity26 study the find suggests one - way breathing may have originated 270 million years ago - 20 million years earlier than first thought			1
other than the @entity8 alligator , the savannah monitor lizard is the only other known reptile found with the ability to breathe in this way			1
this is in contrast to humans and other mammals who have a two - way , or ‘ tidal ’ , breathing pattern			2
tidal breathing means air enters the lungs through airways and then flows back out again the same way			0
rather than being partially filled with stale air , like human lungs , a bird ’s lungs contain air with much higher oxygen content to help them fly			2
' who knows when the next asteroid hits , maybe monitor lizards will inherit the @entity31 , ' said @entity37 , a biologist at @entity38 the study showed that air enters the lizard 's trachea or windpipe , and then flows into the two primary airways , which enter the lung			1
but then , instead of flowing tidally back out the same way , the air loops back in a tail - to - head direction moving from one lateral airway to the next through small perforations between them			0

‘ it has been thought to be important for enabling birds to support strenuous activity , such as flight			2
we now know it 's not unique to birds , ’ said @entity114 , the study 's senior author and an associate professor of biology at the @entity26			0
but professor @entity114 cautioned that , because lizard lungs have a different structure than bird and alligator lungs , it is also possible that one - way airflow evolved independently			2
the evolution would have occurred about 250 million years ago in the archosaurs , the group that gave rise to alligators , dinosaurs and birds			1
the researchers performed ct scans and made 3d images of lizard lungs to visualise the anatomy of the lungs			0
they surgically implanted flow meters in the bronchi of five monitor lizards to measure airflow direction			0
using lungs removed from 10 dead lizards , the researchers measured air flow as they pumped air into and out of the lungs			0
they also pumped water filled with sunflower pollen or plastic microspheres through lizard lungs , and the movement of the pollen and spheres also showed the unidirectional airflow			0
the study showed that air enters the lizard 's trachea or windpipe , and then flows into the two primary airways , which enter the lung			0
but then , instead of flowing tidally back out the same way , the air loops back in a tail - to - head direction moving from one lateral airway to the next through small perforations between them			0
‘ it shows our previous notions about the function of these one - way patterns of airflow are inadequate			0
they are found in animals besides those with fast metabolisms , ’ said professor @entity114 .			0

the savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one - way loop
one - way breathing in birds evolved due to high - oxygen demands of flight
but in lizards it could have been adaptation to low oxygen on ancient @entity31
the find suggests one - way breathing originated 270 million years ago - 20 million years earlier than first thought
