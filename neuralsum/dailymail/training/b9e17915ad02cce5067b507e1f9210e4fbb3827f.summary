@entity0 has dropped his pledge to enshrine the government 's commitment to aid spending in law - after failing to convince @entity7 mps			1
the prime minister wanted to make it legally binding for @entity10 to spend 0.7 % of the country 's income - around £ 1 in every £ 142 - on foreign aid			1
but @entity14 revealed this morning that mr @entity0 had failed to win round his own mps and will not include the bill in the @entity17 next wednesday			1
@entity0 has consistently backed increased spending on foreign aid - insisting that the government would not ' balance the books on the backs of the world 's poor ' - but has backed down in the face of growing @entity7 resistance @entity14 shrugged off last week 's disastrous council and @entity28 election results to come out fighting for a legally - binding commitment to foreign aid spending this morning the deputy prime minister said : ' the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our nation ’s wealth on aid , and also to enshrine this in law , will be in the @entity40 ’ manifesto			1
' as of last year , we are spending 0.7 per cent , and that is a huge achievement			2
' it ’s an open secret that the @entity40 wanted to take the additional step of legislating – which is why it ’s in the @entity48			1
' as you know we have not been able to convince our @entity48 partners to do that , but the @entity40 have not given up – we are going to keep pushing to get 0.7 per cent into law			1
' a senior @entity40 source blamed the decision to drop the aid pledge on @entity7 mps			1
he said : ‘ it is no secret that this was not a popular policy on the backbenches of the conservative party and we were very keen on it			2
‘ it was in our manifesto and in the coalition agreement			2
some at the top of the conservative party still remain convinced it ’s the right thing to do , but it wo n’t be in the @entity17			0
’ @entity7 mp @entity71 welcomed the decision to drop the planned legislation , but said the aid budget should also be cut			2
mr @entity71 said : ‘ i am delighted that we are dropping the idea of fixing this ridiculous target in law but we are still spending far too much			2
‘ at a time when virtually every other government department is having to drastically cut back their budgets we are spending billions more on aid in order to meet an arbitrary target that is nothing more than a sticking plaster			1
we should n’t be shovelling money out of the door at the end of the year in order to meet a target – it should be based on need			2
‘ and if we really want to help the world ’s poor the single biggest thing we could do is open up trade , but the @entity94 blocks that to protect @entity96 farmers			0
mr @entity14 reveled that the government would be dropping the aid target in a speech this morning on @entity100			1
the deputy prime minister lashed out at the ' myths ' that had developed around aid spending			1
mr @entity14 said : ' the @entity10 public believe that around 20 per cent of all the money the @entity97 spends in a year goes on foreign aid			1
' in reality , we spend 0.7 per cent of our nation ’s income			0
that in itself is an historic achievement - we are now the first of the world ’s wealthiest countries to meet this long - held promise			0
' ' it is still a lot of money			0
but , to put it into some kind of perspective , it ’s less than what we spend on takeaways every year			0
' deputy pm @entity14 said the @entity40 will make it a manifesto commitment to make aid spending legally binding he said it was not true the cash was used to ' line the pockets of corrupt officials overseas '			1
mr @entity14 said : ' it ’s simply not the case that people ’s taxes are frittered away , wasted on irrelevant projects or problems we can not solve			0
' the deputy pm added : ' the things we do with this money are also clearly in @entity10 ’s own interests too : making our people safer and more prosperous			1
' when @entity148 ca n’t prevent young men getting radicalised and trained by militants within its borders , that can lead to terrorist attacks on our streets			0
' when @entity153 ca n’t tackle the problem of piracy , it disrupts the trade routes of @entity10 businesses			1
' he said : ' so let the aid sceptics – @entity160 and others on the right - continue to campaign against these efforts			2
their cynicism is , i believe , out of step with our national interest and with the compassion we feel as a country towards those who are suffering elsewhere			0
' they might want to sneer at the generosity of the @entity10 people			1
i lead a party that believes we should celebrate it			0
' mr @entity14 said there were ' millions that still have to live on less than £ 1 a day '			1
he said he disagreed with those who say we should leave @entity183 - @entity182 ’s richest country to ' sort out its own problems '			0
mr @entity14 said : ' one in ten of the world ’s poor now live in @entity183			0
one in six of the world ’s children not in school are in @entity183			0
' the situation is particularly bleak in the @entity191 , where living conditions are as tough as in any warzone			0
targeted attacks by @entity195 on vaccination centres threaten a polio epidemic across the region			0
and just last week , the country was hit by a wave of bombing attacks			0
' what @entity183 shows us is that you ca n’t judge a country ’s progress by its economic statistics alone			0
' he said he did not back a rule to ' arbitrarily cut off our help when a country hits a certain gdp target ' .			2

the prime minister wanted to make aid pledge legally binding
*proposals* would see £ 1 in every £ 142 earned in @entity10 spent on foreign aid
@entity40 and labour back the pledge and it is in the @entity48 agreement
but @entity0 has been forced to remove it from @entity227 's speech
government insists it is still hitting target even if it is not legally binding
