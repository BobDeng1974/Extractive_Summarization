by @entity0 welcome back to the second installment of @entity2 , my blog about the goings on in @entity7 tv show made in @entity8 , mixed up with a few of my favourite things - adrenalin sports , fine - dining , travel , fashion , health , fitness , fast cars , love and romance			1
this week on made in @entity8 i have been plagued by new girlfriend syndrome – the point when your new lady - friend decides it ’s time to mould you into a better man			1
it starts on the little things like your wardrobe and before you know it your whole world has been turned upside down			2
she did it under the sub-text of needing to free up some hangers for her own clothes ( i believe @entity42 do them for £ 1 each , and i do n’t think they are in short supply ) but as we do n't have any @entity47 flat - pack furniture stores nearby in @entity8 so it was a golden opportunity for @entity49 to veto a few more experimental clothing items in my repertoire			2
' this can just go in the trash , ' she charmingly pointed out after pulling out a leather jacket with some sparkly bits on it			2
' who do you think you are ? @entity59 , so shocking honey			2
' she then placed it neatly in the charity shop pile			0
top fashion : other inspired fashion and style moves of the show included @entity69 's cutting edge new haircut the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) for those not familiar with the world of reality tv , @entity30 was also on the tv show @entity76 in @entity77			1
she is blonde , leggy , stunning and is the sister of @entity79 , who appeared on celebrity big brother earlier this year with his wife @entity81			0
i met @entity0 when studying at film school in @entity84 years ago , and lived with @entity85 , who was also in @entity76			1
so when @entity30 planned a trip over to @entity87 , @entity79 asked me to look after her for him			0
( the fact that i was given the task of looking after a stunning blonde was the source of some amusement for many of the cast of @entity0 )			1
in this week 's @entity0 show there have been several outbreaks of flirtatious behaviour – @entity0 and @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 - but it ’s our love affair with fashion that i want to focus on			1
@entity101 was upset at @entity99 moving in on her ex-boyfriend @entity105 and vented her displeasure at @entity100 , but as she opened up her heart about the painful situation , i increasingly found myself distracted by @entity100 ’s holographic rainbow - coloured leopard print sleeves			0
i found that if you stare at them for a long time they have a slightly hypnotic effect , which i ’m sure @entity100 used to its full advantage			0
other inspired fashion and style moves of the show included @entity69 ’s cutting edge new haircut the @entity71 , and @entity123 ’s bold orange jacket at @entity125 's polo			1
the polo was also a great opportunity to show off a wonderful collection of hats ( for the girls ) and sunglasses			0
@entity101 wore an amazing oversized hat which could have been seen from space and @entity99 opted for a more @entity135 style floppy option			1
as for the sunglasses , they were most often worn on top of the head as @entity140 did with a fabulous pair of oversized white frames , whilst @entity99 went for a slightly @entity144 60 's style and @entity145 went for a slightly surreal pair sun protectors which appeared to have model leopards draped over the top of her frames			1
hats off to her style : @entity101 wore an amazing oversized hat which could have been seen from space at the polo i have been continuing with my psychotherapy sessions – both on - and - off air – which i ’ve got to say have been increasingly productive			2
( btw during my tv session last night there was a neat close of up the book @entity162 by @entity164 , which was a nice touch			0
) this week my therapist helped me make a major breakthrough with the realisation that the feelings i hold from my exes may not be entirely appropriate , but it ’s a work in progress and i ’m clearly not fixed quite yet			0
one downside to the week however was that it ended up being rather expensive – i was left to pay for @entity140 ’s bill at @entity176 restaurant , admittedly after gatecrashing her dinner date with @entity178			0
you might be justified in saying that i deserved that one but i also managed to pick up an eye - watering bar tab at @entity125 ’s polo			0
i made the schoolboy error of keeping a card behind the bar			0
all my @entity0 chums must have heard my tab number because they all waded in and by the end of the day i practically had to take out a second mortgage to pay it off			1
therapy : this week my therapist helped realise that the feelings i hold from my exes , like @entity140 ( pictured ) , may not be entirely appropriate , but it 's a work in progress and i 'm clearly not fixed quite yet			2
