@entity1 ’s problems are not confined to the @entity2			1
over the pond , @entity4 manager @entity3 is finding life increasingly difficult following a patchy start to the season which continued on thursday night as @entity9 snatched a late draw in a match which had been bossed for long periods by the men in sky blue			1
the pressure has n’t reached @entity17 proportions			0
it 's too early for that			2
@entity4 's @entity20 opened the scoring before his side were pegged back yet @entity3 and @entity4 will be under no illusions about the task in hand			1
a superb second half strike from @entity20 looked to have put an end to a run of just one win from the first five matches			1
but , as is ever the case in @entity33 , haphazard defending allowed @entity34 to stab in on 86 minutes			1
as long as @entity36 stays fit - he came off at halftime with a hamstring strain here - and the squad continues to gel , @entity35 will arrive here in the summer and join a side who slowly but surely will have adapted to the task in hand by then			1
this though was a reminder of how much work needs to be done			0
the @entity50 sports fans have been quick to adopt @entity1 ’s plans though it will take more time – and a more wins – for the club to really catch light			1
they will never , and do n’t expect to compare to the might of the @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60			0
they are sporting titans in a city bursting with stars			0
certainly a look around @entity66 at kick - off was all you needed to see that the initial spike of interest in @entity4 has quickly dimmed			1
@entity36 was forced off with a hamstring injury at half time on thursday night the opening game attendance of over 60,000 seemed like a hazy distant memory			1
it ’s another reminder , not that the club bosses required one , of the desperate need for a permanent football specific home			2
but , to be fair , as the game wore on the atmosphere and excitement was enough to leave the attendees wanting more even if the @entity2 itself does little to help the product on the pitch			0
@entity33 needs to start acknowledging international breaks like everyone else			1
city ’ s @entity90 , arguably their best player thus far , was unavailable having played for the @entity93 in their win over @entity96 on wednesday night while the likes @entity97 missed @entity2 matches during the last round of @entity100 qualifier			2
that can not help the progress of the game here			0
another quirk this side of the pond saw @entity108 lock horns with @entity3 ’ side just four days after beating them at home 2 - 1			1
it ’s perhaps an attempt to recreate the mini-series of matches like in baseball			2
@entity1 , though , created nothing of note early on			2
@entity36 ’s second @entity33 strike in @entity108 had brought his side level before @entity120 slotted home a late winner yet the @entity124 star was feeding off scraps here			1
indeed the chances were falling at the other end of the pitch , @entity127 striker @entity126 firing just over to keep the stuttering home side firmly on their toes			1
@entity36 sparked into life every time the ball fell at his feet yet his markers were n’t giving an inch			1
three surrounded the former @entity139 forward on 25 minutes and after he was ushered out of play , full - back @entity137 needed no invitation to get stuck into the @entity142 by pushing his square in the chest			0
@entity145 have made a slow start to the @entity33 season , winning just once it was handbags at best			1
yet it showed just how wary @entity9 were of @entity152 ’s class			0
and on 27 minutes , the first moment of magic should have resulted in the opener			0
a sweet flick from the 33 year - old beautifully teed up @entity20 only for the @entity157 to blaze over			2
he really should have scored			0
it goes without saying that @entity152 was emphatically the best player on the pitch			0
a canny dummy helped split the @entity108 backline in half but @entity164 could n’t get round keeper @entity165			2
@entity3 needed the rest of the team to start performing after the break though			0
and , to their credit , they did			0
@entity171 was denied by @entity165 ’s outstretched leg before @entity173 headed wide			0
finally there was some urgency and on 57 minutes , there was a goal			0
it was a superb strike by @entity20 who cut inside with an excellent first touch before curling home			1
@entity108 though , home of @entity183 , stayed strong before delivering that late knock - out blow			2
perhaps @entity3 should give @entity17 a call at some point soon			0
both are enduring tough times .			0

@entity4 's patchy start to the season continued
@entity20 put the home side ahead but @entity34 levelled late on
@entity1 have won just one of their opening six matches in @entity33
@entity36 was forced off at half time with a hamstring strain
