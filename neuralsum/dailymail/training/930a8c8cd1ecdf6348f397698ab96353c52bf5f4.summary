by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 15:00 est , 28 november 2013 @entity3 's @entity2 government today threatened to stop private companies paying their executives too much			2
in a move which will be met with widespread anger in the corporate world , finance minister @entity6 said ' we will have to legislate ' if salaries and other benefits are too high			1
mr @entity6 was reacting to a decision by @entity15 ceo @entity14 to finally turn down a £ 17.5m pension pot. ' we will have to legislate ' : @entity3 finance minister @entity6 ( left ) and the socialist government have threatened to stop private companies paying their executives too much after @entity15 ceo @entity14 ( right ) finally decided to turn down a £ 17.5m pension pot the loss - making car company wanted to reward mr @entity14 with the vast sum , but changed its mind following an outcry from mainly left - wing critics			1
' it was a wise decision , ' said mr @entity6			1
' i 've always said , and this is the government 's position , that we first of all have to make sure that self - regulation works			0
' if it does not , then we will have to legislate			0
what happened yesterday does not change that			0
' mr @entity6 is a key lieutenant of president @entity35 , who famously said ' i do n't like the rich ' during his election campaign last year			1
he has since attempted to introduce a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent , leading to a number of high - profile entrepreneurs and celebrities moving abroad			1
cash - strapped company : under mr @entity14 's stewardship of @entity46 some 11,000 job losses were made and a pay freeze enforced sparking staff demonstrations outside the @entity15 headquarters in @entity50 last year meanwhile , the @entity3 economy has gone into crisis , with unemployment and the cost of living spiralling			1
opinion polls meanwhile indicate that mr @entity35 is by far the most unpopular president in the history of @entity3 and somebody very few people trust to run a major @entity61 country			2
mr @entity35 has backed the scuppering of the @entity46 boss 's pension pot , saying it was ' a wise decision ' , adding : ' that is the least one can say			0
' he was backed by other senior politicians , including industry minister @entity68 who said companies should not over pay			0
mr @entity68 said : ' there should be a bit more self - discipline among those awarding themselves obscene salaries and unacceptable perks			0
but all the evidence points to that not happening			0
' mr @entity68 said the government had been able to put pressure on @entity46 over mr @entity14 's package because it receives support from the state			1
right idea : @entity3 president @entity35 ( right ) said it was a ' wise decision ' and backed the scuppering of the @entity46 boss ' pension pot , as has industry minister @entity68 ( left ) ' for private companies , if self - discipline does not work , the legislature is perfectly entitled to proceed to regulation , ' said @entity93			2
mr @entity14 will retire as @entity46 chief next year , and has now completely waived his right to his proposed package , which would have provided an annual pension worth some 280,000 a year			2
under his stewardship , @entity46 has announced some 11,000 job losses , and implemented a pay freeze .			0
