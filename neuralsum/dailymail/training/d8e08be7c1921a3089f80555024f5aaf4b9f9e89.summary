@entity1 captain @entity0 believes @entity3 's dramatic equaliser against former club @entity4 could prove to be a pivotal moment in the title race			1
@entity3 's late volley against the side he represented for 13 distinguished years kept @entity1 within five points of the leaders rather than an imposing seven			1
' ever since i have been at this club , seasons and big moments have been decided on small events like this one so i will never underestimate what it could mean to our season			0
it could be crucial , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity3 's goal against former club @entity4 could be key to the title race , says @entity0 after 13 years at @entity4 , @entity3 's celebration was muted out of respect after he scored the equaliser ' @entity3 brings quality			1
the goal he scored you would have seen from him for the last 15 years in the @entity29			1
' he is clever and still extremely motivated			0
it is not a word you make up , it is something that helps and it is like his goal : keeping your head cool in a moment when you are under pressure and down to 10 men - how many players would have scored that goal ? ' he has proven it himself in only a few minutes , which is good			2
' @entity3 will not be around when the title race is settled , with a new life at @entity46 waiting for him in the new year , but @entity0 believes both parties are getting a good deal from his short - term loan arrangement			1
@entity3 beat former team - mate @entity50 to a ball in the box before beating keeper @entity53 @entity1 fans celebrate as @entity3 walks away following his 85th - minute goal ' i think it goes both ways			1
he needed what we can offer him and i think we needed what he can bring to us , ' said the @entity63 skipper			0
' if you talk to him i reckon that 's how he sees it as well and his goal was just the icing on the cake			0
' ultimately you play so many competitions you need all the guys to be there and he is another who will clearly make our team stronger			0
' the nature of the @entity78 schedule does offer the tantalising prospect of a future return for @entity3 , though at 36 this would appear to be his farewell to @entity84 football			2
@entity0 does not know if the chance will come again but has no doubts @entity3 is still up to the task			2
' that is not for me to judge , i think he has his personal plans as well , but i can base things on what i see day in , day out on the training ground and he is one of the better players , ' the @entity1 skipper added			0
' that is as simple as it is			0
the rest is not up to me			0
