by @entity0 last updated at 8:21 am on 2nd march 2012 @entity3 is undermining the rights of gipsies and travellers to housing which is ‘ culturally acceptable ’ to them , @entity2 ’s human rights watchdog has warned			1
@entity9 , @entity10 at the @entity11 , also said the eviction of travellers from the illegal @entity15 camp last year was a violation of their rights , ‘ highly regrettable ’ and must never happen again			2
mr @entity9 ’s comments emerged yesterday after it was revealed he wrote to the secretary of state for communities and local government , @entity21 , stating : ‘ the continuing shortage of adequate permanent and transit sites for gipsies and travellers living in caravans is a priority area to address			1
’ @entity2 human rights commissioner @entity9 , left , demanded that the government ease the shortage of caravan sites for travellers in @entity3 as a ' priority ' in a letter to @entity21 , right he said providing such housing was a ‘ pre-condition for the enjoyment of other human rights , including the rights to education and health ’			1
the @entity11 also runs the @entity41 , which @entity42 is currently trying to reform following its repeated interference in decisions made by @entity3 courts and @entity46			2
the court ’s attempts to overrule democratic institutions in this country have provoked widespread demands from @entity53 backbenchers for @entity3 to pull out of the @entity11			2
mr @entity9 ’s comments prompted criticism from @entity55 , @entity53 mp for @entity56 , in @entity57			0
she said : ‘ this is another disgraceful example of @entity2 using the facade of human rights to meddle in our domestic affairs and attack laws passed by our @entity46			1
the commissioner should show respect for the work the government is doing rather than attack it			0
’ human rights : a hooded protester stands behind a burning barricade as riot police and bailiffs advance to evict the @entity15 travellers ' site last october @entity75 : police stand behind their shields in riot formation as they move in to clear the site she added : ‘ @entity2 ’s unaccountable bureaucrats know nothing about planning matters in this country and after the problems at @entity15 , they are out of touch with the @entity3 people			1
’ the latest statistics show that the number of caravans on unauthorised sites increased from 728 to 2,395 between 2000 and 2010			0
around 80 families illegally camped at @entity15 in @entity93 , @entity57 , were evicted last october after ten years of legal battles			0
the process cost taxpayers more than £ 6million as travellers exploited every last legal avenue to try to stave off the bailiffs			0
panic : a woman turns to flee as she is faced by baton - wielding police officers ' ethnic cleansing ' : supporters of the travellers hang banners from a barricade before the eviction despite the intervention of a @entity111 human rights expert , appeals by actress @entity112 and attempts by protest groups to block the evictions from @entity2 ’s largest illegal traveller site , they went ahead			1
however , within weeks , some of the evicted travellers were back with their caravans , either on nearby pitches legally occupied by travellers or in nearby lanes			0
referring to the evictions , mr @entity9 said : ‘ the rights to adequate housing of travellers in @entity93 have already been violated once			0
the authorities should ensure that no further violations take place and should work responsibly towards a solution that is acceptable for all			0
’ the @entity132 - born @entity10 singled out mr @entity21 as he published a 250 - page report on gipsy human rights across @entity2 which was severely critical of @entity3 .			1

@entity2 human rights commissioner *scolds* @entity137 in letter
@entity21 says @entity3 has *strong* *anti-discrimination* legal *framework*
