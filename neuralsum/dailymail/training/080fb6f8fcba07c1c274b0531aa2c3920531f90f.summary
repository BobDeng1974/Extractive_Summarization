@entity0 , headmistress of @entity1 , fears some of her most talented pupils could miss out on places at universities because they have been unfairly denied a * s the exams regulator today said it will look again at @entity7 amid claims that thousands of students have been treated unfairly			1
@entity10 admitted there were ' questions about how grade boundaries were set in a very small number of units across the year '			1
the move comes amid threats of legal action from local authorities and teachers			0
it was revealed this week that the proportion of @entity23 - taken by pupils in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - awarded an a * - c grade had fallen for the first time in 24 years			1
in a letter to the @entity31 , @entity10 chief regulator @entity32 wrote : ' we recognise the continuing concerns among students , parents and teachers about this year ’s gcse @entity25 results			1
' we will look closely at how the results were arrived at			0
we will do this quickly , but thoroughly , so that we ensure confidence is maintained in our examinations system			1
' ms @entity32 said she expected to gather evidence over the next week and that @entity10 would then meet awarding bodies to discuss its findings			1
a @entity47 spokeswoman said : ' we welcome this move '			0
headteachers yesterday demanded the remarking of hundreds of thousands of @entity23 papers and threatened exam boards with legal action amid an escalating ‘ grade - fixing ’ scandal			1
in a furious letter to education secretary @entity57 , they called for an urgent inquiry into the ‘ manifest unfairness ’ of ‘ appalling ’ marking in this summer ’s gcse @entity25 exams			1
the @entity31 , representing 28,500 heads and deputies , called for all @entity25 exams sat in the summer to be regraded against more lenient criteria used for papers taken earlier in the year			1
under fire : education secretary @entity57 has received a furious open letter from headteachers calling for an urgent inquiry into the ' manifest unfairness ' of ' appalling ' marking in this summer 's gcse @entity25 exams a second union , the @entity71 , which has more than 17,000 members , echoed calls for an independent inquiry and revealed it was considering legal action against exam boards on the grounds that ethnic minority pupils and those from poor homes are likely to have been hit hardest by the fiasco			1
private school heads joined the outcry , including the headmistress of this year ’s top school for a-levels , who warned that results in gcse @entity25 appear to have been ‘ artificially depressed ’			2
@entity0 , head of £ 31,950 - a - year @entity1 , fears that some of her most talented pupils could miss out on places at leading universities because they have been unfairly denied a * s. the man who investigated a similar grading scandal in 2002 added his voice to calls for an independent inquiry and encouraged examiners with knowledge of what happened to blow the whistle			2
sir @entity103 ’s inquiry into the deliberate downgrading of a-levels led to nearly 2,000 grades being changed			2
top of the class : @entity108 and @entity109 are celebrating after achieving 11 a * s each he told the @entity110 the problems with @entity112 had ‘ all the similarities ’ with the a-level fiasco a decade ago , which ultimately led to the resignation of the then education secretary @entity116			0
‘ someone needs to look at it because i suspect that there will be a growing dissatisfaction with the system			2
sooner or later that has to be diffused , ’ he told the @entity110			0
‘ i do n’t know what the best mechanism is but something needs to be done to reassure students and teachers one way or the other			0
’ he added : ‘ teachers have said it ’s changed , the boards have got to say it has n’t or the papers were more difficult or whatever			0
’ if an examiner has felt there had been pressure to change the grade boundaries , ‘ someone has to squeal and say “ we were leaned on ” '			1
the mounting furore will pile pressure on education secretary @entity57 , who has been accused of exerting political pressure over results , as well as exam boards and the standards watchdog @entity10			1
the row follows the first fall in 24 years in the number of a * to c grades awarded at @entity23 , from 69.8 per cent to 69.4 per cent			0
@entity25 results fell 1.5 points to 63.9 per cent , and @entity25 literature 2.1 points to 76.3 per cent			0
@entity10 had issued a directive to exam boards to do more to contain grade inflation			1
jumping for joy : @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 from the @entity164 enjoy the moment after receiving their results concern is centred around @entity25 because changes to syllabuses this year presented boards with a tougher challenge maintaining standards on last year			0
they appear to have set grade boundaries too low for papers taken earlier in the two - year course – effectively resulting in too many students getting good grades – and took corrective action this summer to avoid significant grade inflation			1
this involved raising grade boundaries for exams taken in june			1
pupils who took one task set by the @entity188 board in january needed 54 per cent of the marks to get a c but had to get 66 per cent for a similar assignment taken in june			2
heads claim it is unfair because pupils taking exams at earlier sittings will have been at a distinct advantage over those who took their final exams in june			2
they also say that ‘ changing the goalposts ’ means that pupils who believed they were on course for good grades in the summer inexplicably dipped			0
' shambles ' : @entity205 , general secretary of the @entity31 , said it was not fair to discriminate against pupils because they sat their exam in june rather than january @entity205 , general secretary of the @entity31 , branded the problems a ‘ shambles ’ , adding : ‘ it is simply not fair to damage the opportunities of young people in this way , discriminating against them purely because they sat their exam in june rather than january			0
‘ not only does it offend natural justice , this manifestly inconsistent mark scheme risks putting question marks over the grades achieved in january , too			0
parents are up in arms at what they see as the denigration of their child 's hard work and effort			0
‘ as such , we are calling for an independent inquiry as to how this situation has been allowed to happen			2
‘ we are also asking for all papers from june to be remarked using january ’s criteria , thereby ensuring young people are not adversely penalised by this unfair and illogical system			2
’ meanwhile the @entity71 is backing an investigation started by @entity25 ’s largest academy chain into the backgrounds of pupils denied grades vital to their future lives by exam board decisions , the @entity235 reported			0
@entity243 , @entity71 general secretary , said : ‘ we suspect the very ad hoc decision that was made to lift the grade boundaries has disproportionately affected certain groups of students and so we think it is very worthwhile to examine this further and gather evidence			1
‘ if we are advised that legal action is the right way to challenge this , then that is what we will do			0
’ legal action over the controversy is also being mooted by individual schools and local authorities including @entity259 and @entity260			0
but this is the first suggestion that it could focus on alleged discrimination against the already disadvantaged - an outcome that could be deeply embarrassing for ministers who have pledged to improve the education of under - privileged pupils			0
shadow education secretary @entity267 has written to the commons education select committee calling on it to hold an inquiry into @entity25 gcses this summer			2
‘ i have been told of cases where candidates who took gcse @entity25 this summer and submitted their coursework for moderation in june were awarded a grade d , whereas if they had submitted that same coursework for moderation in january they would have received a grade c , ’ he said			0
the @entity280 - controlled @entity279 has already launched its own review of gcse @entity25			0
@entity282 , the administration ’s education minister , accused mr @entity57 of politicising the system			1
‘ it 's a shame that we 're seeing politics brought into the exam process by the secretary of state for education in @entity25 , @entity57 , ' he told @entity26			1
‘ when @entity57 says jump , the head of @entity10 says “ how high ? ”			1

@entity10 admits there questions about how some grade boundaries were set
chief regulator vows to ' ensure confidence is maintained in our examinations system '
