two wealthy couples have spent £ 500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘ a few feet ’ of muddy ditch between their homes , shocked @entity5 judges heard yesterday			1
the couples have lavished six - figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in @entity13			0
businessman @entity14 and his wife @entity15 insist they have a right to drive over the ditch and down the track next to their five - acre property in @entity21 , as a shortcut to @entity23 – home to sir @entity25 and a host of other celebrities			1
land battle : @entity29 have spent £ 500,000 in a dispute over a ' few feet ' of ditch			2
the @entity14 from @entity32 ( right ) wants to drive over it along a track , in red , but the @entity36 , from @entity37 ( left ) , say they are ' breaking the law ' their neighbours , @entity40 , 75 , and his wife @entity41 , 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – say the @entity44 are breaking the law and that their animals are disturbed by traffic passing along the track			1
the @entity36 are asking @entity49 ’s @entity5 to rule that the @entity44 do not own the whole ditch , and have no legal right to drive over it			1
@entity52 said : ‘ this case is about a patch of land a few feet either way			2
what are the costs in the case so far ? half a million ? i imagine that the disputed right of way is worth rather less			0
’ the area surrounding @entity21 and @entity23 is home to footballing royalty , including @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
unhappy : @entity14 won a ruling in their favour last year but his rival @entity40 , right , says their cars disturb the animals they breed on their land @entity52 , lord justice @entity75 and sir @entity76 heard that the @entity44 ’ property and the @entity79 ’ home were originally part of one parcel of land , which was divided and sold off in 1950			1
the @entity79 ’ land has been in their family for years , while the @entity44 moved in in 2004 , said @entity86 , for @entity87 and mrs @entity88			2
after getting on initially , the couples fell out over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track			0
wrangle : the @entity94 use this track as a way to get to nearby @entity23 , which makes their neighbours furious miss @entity86 said the @entity36 saw red when @entity87 and mrs @entity98 began using the bridle path – beside which they grazed their alpacas – as a means of cutting a few minutes off their drive into @entity23			1
years of bitter feuding in and outside court ensued , with the @entity44 insisting they were exercising a legitimate right of way and the @entity36 claiming their neighbours were breaking the law			1
the @entity44 scored a victory at @entity109 in december last year , when the judge ruled that they own the whole ditch and that their boundary lies in the middle of the track , giving them the right to drive over the ditch			2
but the @entity36 are challenging that decision , saying their neighbours ’ boundary reaches only halfway across the ditch , and they are legally blocked from crossing the other half in a vehicle			2
miss @entity86 told the judges yesterday that land registry plans prove the border of the @entity44 ’ home extends no further than the centre of the ditch			0
bitter : @entity98 , left , and her husband @entity129 are battling neighbours @entity88 , right , and her husband @entity131 over the right of way row @entity134 , for mrs and mrs @entity94 , said that even if the couple did not own the whole ditch , they had established a legitimate vehicular right of way through long usage			0
‘ mr and mrs @entity98 have always maintained that a right of way through the gate and over and along the track was necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of [ their home ] because of the size of the property and its particular geographic location , ’ he added			0
lord @entity150 , expressing bafflement over the protracted war over a ditch , asked the lawyers : ‘ what is so special about it ? ’ mr @entity134 said : ‘ using the way for the purpose of travelling to and from the closest town of @entity23 gave rise to a significantly shorter journey than would have been the case had that same journey been made using the public highway			1
’ the judges have reserved their decision until a later date			0
confusion : judges at the @entity169 in @entity49 expressed their shock that both parties have spent £ 500,000 in a legal battle over a ditch			0

@entity29 have been rowing for years over who owns ' thin strip ' of land
the @entity14 family believe they have right to drive over it along a track
rivals the @entity36 say they *'re* ' breaking law ' and *spooking* their animals
@entity14 and wife @entity15 won ruling in their favour last december
now @entity41 and @entity40 have taken that decision to @entity5
lord @entity150 expressed *disbelief* at *spiralling* cost of legal case
