much - maligned @entity1 character @entity0 is killed off in a deleted scene leaked from the @entity3			1
but everything is not as it seems as it appears the scene has been edited by one @entity8 fan to show the character going to his watery grave			2
the minute - long clip , apparently scrapped from the 1999 film , opens with @entity14 ( @entity15 ) and @entity16 ( @entity17 ) surfacing in their ship with @entity20 on a fast - flowing river			1
a panicky @entity0 fails to grab hold of the wire in time and as the force of the water pulls the vessel over the waterfall he is heard plummeting to his death			2
but sharp - eyed @entity1 fans have spied this newly - surfaced clip , shown on @entity40 , may not be the whole story			1
as @entity43 reports , this clip is an cut down version of the actual scene which has an extra 20 seconds of footage showing the @entity48 pulling a soaked @entity0 out of the water before the three of them head away from the shore			1
it is believed the original scene was released on dvd but then cut from later releases			0
fans of the blockbuster films have a long - running dislike of the unpopular character and some hailed the clip as the way the film should have been			2
one commenter wrote : ' i 'm so happy this exists , yet so sad they deleted it			0
' another added : ' i do n't care if it makes kids cry			0
that was the @entity1 we deserved			0
' jedis : @entity17 ( left as @entity16 ) and @entity15 ( right as @entity14 ) manage to get to shore in the clip but ca n't save @entity0			0

fans hail scene showing @entity20 plummeting over waterfall
scene was cut from 1999 film
