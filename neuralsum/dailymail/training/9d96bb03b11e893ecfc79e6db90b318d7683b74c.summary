@entity0 admitted to using @entity1 to con four women out of nearly £ 100,000 a lonely hearts conman who scammed four women out of almost £ 100,000 by posing as a @entity5 on dating website @entity1 has been jailed for four years @entity0 , 31 , a @entity7 immigrant , wooed his victims after falsely claiming to be an army captain who ran an orphanage in @entity11			1
adopting the name @entity13 , he claimed he was looking for romance on the site with two profiles : ' @entity17 ' and ' to live and love '			1
but the pictures he used to create an appealing profile were actually of a @entity5 called @entity21 who was unaware his images were being used by @entity0			1
the unnamed women who replied to his seemingly perfect profile fell for his charms but were then duped out of their money when @entity0 claimed he was robbed at his ' orphanage '			1
the women sent him cash and paid his hotel bills thinking they were bailing out their suitor - only for him to divert the money into the bank account of his wife who shared his home with their two children in @entity40 , @entity41			1
@entity41 @entity42 heard yesterday that @entity0 , a father of three , also splashed out on @entity43 , tvs and designer clothes			1
police who investigated the scam discovered the women had tried to meet up with him but he always stood them up			1
he now faces jail after admitting four charges of fraud but is disputing some of the facts and is running a ' trial of issue			1
' prosecutor @entity56 told the court the four victims were registered with @entity1 and did not know each other			1
she added : ' they were all contacted on the dating site by a man called @entity13 who had two profiles under the mottos ' to live and @entity65 ' and ' @entity17 '			1
' they had contact with him during the period the fraud took place via text message , phone and email			2
' he told them he had been a captain in the army			1
he also said he ran an orphanage in @entity11 called the @entity78 , for which he set up a website with his own mobile phone number on			1
@entity41 @entity42 heard @entity0 , from @entity40 in @entity41 , diverted the money from the unnamed into his wife 's account ' there was a profile picture on his @entity1 accounts and he sent some of the women photographs of himself - all of these pictures were actually of a @entity5 commander called @entity21 who knew nothing of what was going on			1
' @entity94 of the women wanted to find out more about him and were led to believe they were in a relationship with him			2
' although they arranged to meet , he never kept to the arrangements and never did meet any of the victims			0
' miss @entity56 added : ' he told the women that on a trip to @entity11 he was the victim of a crime and needed money			1
the crime meant he could not access his own funds			0
' he said they would get their money back and would be sent letters from the @entity108 to show that he would be able to pay them			2
' these letters were sent , but from an @entity112 postmark			0
he also sent them links to websites which , when logging in with details he gave them , appeared to show that he had a huge bank balance and would eventually be able to pay them back			0
' one woman was asked to pay for a hotel for him			2
when she rang the number he gave her for the hotel , they also confirmed the information and she agreed to pay it			2
' she later received a cheque addressed to him for £ 35,000 to prove he had money , but this was later discovered to be a stolen cheque forged in his own handwriting			1
' over a number of months each woman transferred significant sums of money via bank accounts and @entity136 moneygrams and sent items to the defendant 's home address			1
they bought electronic items , took out credit cards and loans and bought clothes from @entity145			0
@entity0 used a @entity5 called @entity21 's @entity147 pictures to create a seemingly perfect @entity1 profile to attract women ' many of the goods were sent to his home address in @entity40 from where the victims believed they would be forwarded on to the defendant in @entity7			1
' when the women stopped sending money , they never heard from him again			1
' the court heard the total amount stolen including the value of the household goods and @entity136 transfers was £ 98,140			2
@entity0 was arrested in october 2012 at his flat and £ 4,500 in cash was found under his bed			1
a digital camera was found purchased by one of the victims , but containing pictures of the defendant and his wife and children			2
designer clothes and shoes were also found worth £ 2,000			2
@entity0 's wallet was also seized and contained several sim cards , some of which contained the phone numbers of the victims			2
his two @entity181 phones were also seized - on these three different email accounts were in use which were linked to the two @entity1 accounts			2
he was bailed and later tried to call one of the woman again under the name @entity13 and was arrested again			2
when questioned he claimed to know nothing of the orphanage but that the £ 4,500 was his and claimed the majority of the items found in his flat were to go to his mother in @entity7			1
he added all he knew of the bank transfers was that his flatmate @entity194 had asked him to have some money transferred to a relative - and claimed mr @entity194 was responsible			2
he admitted he had used @entity1 between 2010 and 2012 but could not remember when exactly			1
detective constable @entity196 , from @entity197 , told the hearing : ' there has never been any evidence to prove there was someone else involved			0
' there was possibly some help involved somewhere in @entity7			0
there may well have been more than one person assisting him , male and female			0
' but i believe any phone calls made to the victims were from the defendant himself			0
' i believe @entity13 is a made - up name			2
i have made enquiries in our systems but there is nothing to suggest he exists			0
' @entity0 , who arrived in @entity220 in 2009 on a visa to study , said : ' the fraud was @entity194 's idea			1
i got involved because i had a few financial difficulties at the time			0
' i did not speak with the complainants			0
i did not know money was being sent to @entity7 but i knew it was being sent to my bank account and my wife 's bank account			0
' i do not know where @entity194 is at the moment			0
i have no idea about the details of this fraud			0
i did n't even know how many victims there were			0
' but i pleaded guilty because if i had not let my bank account or flat be used , these women would not have suffered in the way that they did			0
' @entity194 said he was expecting some money			0
he said he had no bank accounts to receive the money so i wanted to help him			0
he was owing me rent at the time and this was the only way he could pay me			0
' sentencing @entity0 today , judge @entity247 said : ' the evidence against the defendant is , in my judgement , overwhelming			1
' i am satisfied on the evidence i have heard of the facts that the defendant 's role in the enterprise in which these four women were defrauded was a leading role			1
' he was not working alone and others were involved but the use of his bank account and phones and the items found at his flat all indicate overwhelmingly that the defendant was a principle player			0
' the man called @entity194 has not been traced			0
he may have been an accomplice			0
. if @entity194 was an accomplice and took part in this operation , that does not undermine my conclusion			0
that is my ruling on the issue			0
