by @entity0 published : 02:23 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 10 may 2013 a top novelist has asked her fans to redesign classic novels as if they were being marketed at women in protest at the ' girly ' imagery publishers use on book covers for women authors			1
@entity10 writer @entity9 claims publishers use fluffy imagery to market novels by women , so she asked her @entity15 fans to ' coverflip ' classics such as @entity17 's @entity18 and @entity20 's @entity19 as if they had female authors			1
she was amazed at the number designs sent in from readers sympathetic to her gripe			2
@entity26 : the disturbing @entity19 by @entity20 ( left ) is re-imagined as a book written by and intended for a woman ( right ) horror classic @entity30 by @entity31 , which traditionally has disturbing images of the female protagonist on the cover , was reimagined with a smiling blonde in lipstick and soft pastel shades			2
the female version of fantasy masterwork @entity40 by @entity42 , or @entity43 in this case , boasted a young adult - orientated pink and purple cover with a pretty @entity47 and a cute child wielding a sword			0
@entity52 / @entity51 's @entity50 , a stark psychological drama , now has a beautiful ocean view on the cover and is subtitled : ' a novel of self - discovery '			1
not quite as scary : @entity31 's horror masterpiece is wildly different in its new female - friendly incarnation many women writers feel their work is lumbered with patronising covers by publishers ms @entity9 , the author of the shades of @entity65 and the @entity67 series , said : ' i do wish i had a dime for every email i get that says : " please put a non-girly cover on your book so i can read it â€“ signed , a @entity75 "			1
' she even used one of her own covers as an example			1
the cover of @entity80 to the @entity81 shows a neon pink background , an image of a beautiful teenage girl displaying her midriff , and features the words ' a novel ' in a dark pink heart			0
she told @entity89 : ' it 's about three sisters who are dealing with the sudden death of their father			0
may , the middle sister , is trying to hold her family together and learn how to drive			0
' gender reassignment : even @entity9 's own young adult novel @entity98 is changed into how it may look as written by a man from sinister to silly : crime writer @entity101 becomes @entity102 she added : ' the simple fact of the matter is , if you are a female author , you are much more likely to get the package that suggests the book is of a lower perceived quality because it 's " girly " , which is somehow inherently different and easier on the palate			1
' a man and a woman can write books about the same subject matter , at the same level of quality , and that woman is simply more likely to get the soft - sell cover with the warm glow and the feeling of smooth jazz blowing off of it			2
' it 's @entity123 ( left ) deals with controversial themes like teenage depression and suicide , but you would n't know it from the new female version @entity130 , the million - selling self - published novelist , blogged about the ' gender cover - up '			0
she said : ' more women read books than men , more women write books then men , but only a small fraction of books that win literary awards are written by women			1
' women are the publishing industry 's bread and butter , we are the backbone of the damn entertainment industry , but we are constantly demoted to " fluffy " to " light " to " meaningless "			2
' ' i 'm sick to death of this			0
i am so sick of the constant , blatant sexism			0
and any time any one points anything out as being sexist , they 're accused of " whining " or " nagging " or " not taking a joke "			0
' @entity158 author @entity157 went so far as to drop her publisher after her third book , it 's a @entity162 , was given the tagline ' but it takes a woman to run it '			0
@entity167 by @entity168 loses the pretty model for a distinctly more gender - neutral design @entity9 says she receives messages from male fans who do n't feel comfortable reading her books because of the ' girly ' nature of the cover reception : it 's hard to imagine the reviewers who gave @entity179 ( left ) glowing reviews would praise the book on the right quite as highly			1

@entity9 claims publishers *pigeonhole* books by women
she asked fans to ' coverflip ' books like @entity18 and @entity50
she was *inundated* with classics with new ' girly ' covers
