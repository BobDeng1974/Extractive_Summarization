@entity0 were always masters of the late show			0
they were the team that never gave up until the final whistle , often scoring last - gasp goals that snatched victory from the jaws of defeat			0
under sir @entity11 , they made an art form of it , winning innumerable @entity15 games , @entity17 ties and even the @entity18 through their never - say - die spirit			2
opponents would always have that nagging doubt in the back of their minds as the clock ticked ever - more - slowly down			0
@entity32 's winner against @entity34 on sunday came just after the hour - but that is the latest they 've scored so far this season			1
by contrast , they have conceded eight goals beyond 62 minutes , including four at @entity54 in the league and three at @entity57 in the @entity17			0
@entity32 's goal was his first for the club and proved to be the match - winner at @entity61 @entity62 celebrates his injury time winner against @entity65 at @entity61 in 2003 @entity66 scores his crucial stoppage time goal against @entity69 in april 2009 @entity70 celebrates scoring @entity0 's last - gasp winner in the 4 - 3 win over @entity73 in september 2009 courtesy of @entity75 @entity28 's team seem to have lost the knack of scoring late in games , something that is quite alarming considering their porous defence			1
compare this season to the last 10 under sir @entity11 - 468 goals were scored between minutes 0 and 62 , while 296 came between minutes 63 and the final whistle			1
so during @entity11 's last decade at @entity61 , 38.7 per cent of goals came in the final 27 minutes of games plus that indefinite added period known as ' @entity87 '			2
the late show reached its height in the 2009 - 2010 season when 39 of @entity0 's 86 @entity15 goals - or 45 per cent - came after 63 minutes			1
@entity0 had even retained the knack of scoring late goals under @entity94 last season			0
it was n't quite the dying seconds smash - and - grab raids of @entity11 's era but 21 of their 64 league goals came after 63 minutes			1
unless @entity102 's fearsome front line can ensure every match is wrapped up by the hour mark , it is essential they rediscover that characteristic @entity0 ability to keep going until the bitter end .			0

@entity0 have yet to score later than the 62 - minute mark under @entity28 this season
@entity32 's winner against @entity34 on sunday was their latest goal
@entity0 were *specialists* in late winners under sir @entity11
during @entity11 's last 10 seasons in charge , nearly *40* per cent of goals were scored after 63 minutes
