by @entity0 for the @entity1 he has already been billed as the new @entity2 – and it ’s easy to see why			2
like @entity6 ’s star player , @entity4 was born in @entity7 , the capital of @entity8 , but has chosen to represent the @entity6			1
the @entity10 winger will make his debut for @entity13 ’s under - 20 side against @entity14 in @entity15			1
new star : @entity4 has already made an impression for @entity10 and could soon make his full debut but comparisons with @entity2 extend beyond the 18 - year - old ’s birth certificate			1
both moved to the @entity23 at a young age before being picked up by @entity26 clubs – aarons with @entity28 and @entity2 at @entity29 – only for their talent to be recognised by @entity10 and @entity31 respectively			1
@entity4 , like @entity2 , is blessed with blistering pace and no shortage of skill			1
he announced his arrival on the @entity37 stage with a goal – a rare header – and an assist following his second - half introduction against @entity42 last weekend , only @entity44 ’s injury - time strike denying him a match - winning cameo			2
leading light : @entity48 clings onto @entity27 who scores his first @entity10 goal against @entity42 already there is pressure on @entity53 to hand the teenager his first league start when domestic action resumes next weekend , but @entity4 is a level - headed type guarded against getting carried away with his recent rise			1
‘ it ’s been crazy , ’ he said , ‘ i ’ve gone from under - 21s football ( at @entity10 ) to the first team and to under - 20s with @entity6 in no time			1
‘ but it ’s not hard ( to keep my feet on the ground ) , because it ’s not my personality to get carried away with anything			0
ambition : @entity4 has been compared to @entity6 international @entity2 after bright displays ‘ i like to take things in my stride and i ’m quite humble			1
‘ i ’m still in the reserve - team dressing room and that ’s fine			0
my friends are in there and that ’s cool			0
’ the @entity8 @entity77 tried to persuade @entity4 to opt for the country of his birth during the summer , and he admits it was a tough choice			1
‘ it was n’t an easy decision , because i was born in @entity8 , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity6 is a big opportunity for me and i want to go out there and play and impress and show how good a player i am			2
i ca n’t wait to go out and experience something new with @entity6 and i ’ll be confident because i ’m in a good place right now			2
’ making noise : the @entity10 winger is expected to become a real part of @entity53 's plans on the call up , he added : ‘ i was on the physio table getting a bit of treatment when someone came in with the papers			1
it was a complete shock and i did n’t know how to react to it			0
i ’m happy and honoured			0
’ @entity4 ’ graduation to the senior set - up on @entity102 has even come as a surprise to @entity53 and his backroom team			1
while undoubtedly talented , the youngster , much like @entity2 , found it difficult to adjust to a move north aged only 16			0
but two years under the guidance of former @entity6 legend @entity109 has seen @entity27 mature into the player of today			2
‘ when i first came here i found it mentally tough			0
it took me a while to adapt , ’ he went on			0
‘ but after about a year and a half i stared to feel back to my old self , how i felt when i was younger			0
‘ the coaches and the manager have given me confidence and have worked with me day in , day out to help me be the player i want to be			0
‘ @entity109 has helped me a lot			0
and @entity122 has worked with me as well , and the gaffer too – they ’ve all been brilliant			0
’ @entity4 pointed to the name on the back of his shirt following his first senior goal last weekend			2
‘ i ’m not big headed or anything , ’ he said , ‘ i just want people to recognise what i ’m doing for this team and how much it means to be here			0
’ remember the name : @entity4 .			2
