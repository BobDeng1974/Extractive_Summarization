@entity0 was approached by an angry fan towards the end of the game as the home supporters showed their disgust at going out of the competition - but the former @entity8 man looked far from intimidated			1
@entity9 scored a double to help @entity12 progress with a 5 - 2 aggregate win over @entity14			2
the 19 - year - old cousin of @entity16 came off the bench to punish the @entity19 side who were pushing for a winner			0
@entity22 had earlier taken advantage of some lax goalkeeping to add to his goal from the 2 - 1 win in the first leg , meaning @entity29 's fine strike for the @entity19 side was merely a memory by the time the final whistle blew - with @entity14 down to 10 men after the late loss of @entity34			2
an angry @entity14 fan confronts @entity0 ( centre ) after his side were beaten by @entity12 in @entity19 the supporter was held back by security and a member of @entity0 's coaching staff before being led away @entity0 was no pushover in his playing days and the former @entity8 man was known for his passion @entity9 ( centre ) rounds @entity45 to score for @entity12 and put them through @entity16 's cousin clearly turned a few heads after his impressive cameo performance off the bench @entity50 stunned @entity51 with an early goal blitz to seal their spot in the quarter - finals at the expense of their @entity57 rivals			1
@entity51 might have held a narrow advantage after drawing the first leg 1 - 1 in @entity61 but any hopes of progressing were sunk inside 21 minutes on thursday as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 all netted for @entity50			0
sorry @entity51 finished with 10 men following @entity68 's late dismissal			0
@entity65 celebrates after scoring the third goal for @entity50 as they eased past @entity51 @entity70 remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow @entity74 side @entity73			1
having done most of the damage with a 3 - 1 first leg win at @entity77 , @entity70 finished things off at home with a 2 - 1 victory courtesy of second - half goals from @entity82 and his replacement @entity84			1
@entity73 had netted in - between those strikes through @entity87 ' fine free - kick but almost immediately had centre - back @entity88 sent off as they tumbled out 5 - 2 on aggregate			0
on - loan @entity91 player @entity84 ( centre ) heads home the winning goal against ten - man @entity73 @entity94 are also through after a hard - fought goalless draw against @entity96 in @entity97			1
the @entity57 held a 3 - 1 lead from the first leg and that proved sufficient as they survived a second - leg onslaught from @entity103 's men			0
@entity104 qualified for the quarters despite going down 1 - 0 to a late headed goal from @entity108 's @entity107 at the @entity109			2
@entity104 arrived for the second leg in @entity111 with a two - goal cushion , and it proved just enough for @entity115 ' team to progress after a bruising encounter			0
@entity117 ( right ) heads home the winner for @entity108 but it was n't enough to see them go through finally , @entity122 's extra-time score booked @entity124 's spot on away goals after they claimed a 2 - 2 aggregate ' win ' over @entity128			1
@entity130 fired @entity128 ahead in the 60th minute and levelled the tie at 1 - 1 after @entity124 had taken a 1 - 0 lead in the first leg , however neither side could find a winning goal before the 90 minutes were up , meaning the game went into extra-time			1
@entity124 took the advantage when @entity122 calmly broke to the left edge of @entity128 's box before unleashing a shot which found the bottom right corner , meaning that @entity143 's goal late in extra time served little purpose			0
@entity122 ( 10 ) fires home the winner deep into extra-time to put @entity124 into the quarters			0

@entity0 was approached by a @entity14 fan following the *defeat*
@entity50 *defeat*ed @entity153 high - *flyers* @entity51 with an impressive 3 - 0 win
@entity70 won the *battle* of @entity74 as they *comfortably* saw off @entity73
@entity94 and @entity104 are also into the quarter - finals despite failing to win
@entity124 scored in extra-time to knock out @entity162 's @entity128
