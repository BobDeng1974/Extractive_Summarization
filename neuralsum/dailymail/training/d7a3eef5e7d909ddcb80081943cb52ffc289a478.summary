by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:30 est , 2 december 2013 in the @entity5 battle of the next - generation games consoles , there already appears to a clear winner			2
@entity9 ’s @entity8 has not only became the fastest selling console in @entity12 history - selling a quarter of a million consoles in just 48 hours - it sold 100,000 more than rival @entity14 ’s @entity15 in its opening weekend in the @entity12			1
the sales numbers are not official and they have been compiled from retail sales across the country by market tracking firm @entity19 , although this means the figure could be even higher			1
this beat the previous @entity12 console sales record of 185,000 for the @entity29 which launched in 2005			1
@entity9 also broke the record in the @entity31 after it sold around a million consoles in the two days after launch last month hundreds of gamers camped for hours , and in some cases days , to be the first to get their hands on the fourth - generation console as shops across the @entity12 opened at midnight on thursday			1
@entity31 customers got the console two weeks earlier and the launch was just a week after rival @entity14 started selling its @entity15			1
the @entity8 is the first major game machine the @entity45 firm has built since the @entity46 in 2006			2
it comes with @entity48 of @entity49 powered by a custom 8 - core @entity50 plus a @entity53 hard drive			0
the console also has the blu - ray drive seen in its previous , third - generation model			2
the new version of its dualshock controller includes a ' share ' button that allows players to post gameplay footage and screenshots online			0
it has a two - point touchpad and six - axis move motion sensor that works with a 3d camera placed near the tv set			0
other features include a @entity71 , @entity72 and a built - in mono speaker			0
by comparison , @entity14 's @entity15 sold 150,000 in the @entity12 during its launch weekend			1
globally , however , it sold over a million within the first 24 hours , surpassing the sales figures of its previous @entity78 console @entity79 , left , was the first to receive his pre-ordered @entity8 from game in @entity81 , while @entity82 , right , held the honour of being the first in line to hold his console aloft following last week 's launch friday 's launch signalled the official start of the pre-christmas console battle , yet many gamers could end up disappointed as retailers warned of low stocks			1
other retailers sold out of pre-orders weeks ago			0
before the @entity31 launch on november 15 , @entity97 's @entity96 was given a makeover with the iconic letters from the company 's name transformed to look like the buttons from @entity9 's dualshock controller			1
a @entity8 lounge was also set up on the same day in @entity81 so fans could play upcoming games before their official release			2
@entity14 was the first to announce it would be releasing its next - generation console in time for @entity5 during an unveiling at the @entity14 's @entity112 headquarters in may			1
it costs $ 499 in the @entity31 and £ 429 in the @entity12 , making it £ 80 more expensive than @entity9 's @entity113 first gave a sneak preview of the @entity8 a month later , in june			1
at first glance , @entity9 's new dualshock 4 , pictured , looks similar to its predecessor but the twin analogue sticks are spaced slightly further apart			1
the @entity120 and @entity121 buttons are slightly larger and the start and select buttons are replaced by @entity124 and options following its global launch on 15 november , @entity14 sold more than one million @entity15 consoles , surpassing first - day sales of the @entity78 , the previous - generation model that went on sale eight years ago			1
the new console was launched in 13 countries and the software giant said it sold had out almost immediately at most retailers			2
@entity9 's new dualshock controller for @entity8 includes a ' share ' button as well as a two - point touchpad and a six - axis motion sensing system hoping to compete with @entity14 's @entity139 bookmakers @entity140 slashed the odds on @entity8 outselling the @entity15 in 2013 following the unveiling			1
it chopped the odds on the @entity8 being the top selling console in 2013 from 4/11 to 2/9 while the @entity15 ’s odds drifted from 15/8 to 11/4			1
similarly , @entity145 has predicted @entity9 will sell 2.4 million @entity8 consoles by the end of 2013 , with @entity14 managing a similar amount of 2.2 million @entity15 consoles			1
@entity145 expects existing geographical brand allegiance to continue with @entity15 outselling @entity8 in @entity151 , and @entity8 outselling @entity15 across @entity152 combined			1
over the next five years , @entity145 predicts that @entity9 will sell 49 million consoles , while @entity14 will fall short by around 11 million			1
both companies are also expected to benefit from @entity157 's @entity156 weak sales , with some past @entity156 users adopting the latest consoles instead of upgrading to @entity156 @entity160 : $ 399 ( @entity31			2
) £ 349 ( @entity12 )			1

according to media monitoring firm , @entity200 , there were 40 per cent more comments for the @entity8 compared to the @entity15 across social networks			1
the comments were also three times more positive			0
just under half of comments about the latest @entity15 cited ' issues ' , such as faulty hardware or problems with tv connections , but consumers have been impressed by the hand gesture and voice recognition functionality			2
the most talked about issue in relation to the @entity8 was the need to buy a separate camera , however fans did not appear to have been put off by the additional cost , with only 5 per cent citing it as a negative			0
other main talking points included the @entity8 's graphics , competitive price and social features			2
boxes of @entity8 consoles are pictured stacked at the @entity228 for online retail giant @entity229 in @entity230 ahead of friday 's launch @entity232 , managing director @entity12 of @entity200 , said : ' although the @entity8 has only just had its @entity152 launch , there is still a markedly higher level of online buzz compared to the @entity15			1
' the @entity15 has received criticism in some quarters due to hardware glitches , however , consumers are still very positive about the hand gesture and voice recognition upgrades			0
' if the @entity15 had n't experienced teething problems , we would have expected the proportion of positive comments to rival the @entity8			2
however , it is clear that the @entity8 has a much more vocal online consumer base			0
the question is whether these online advocates help to drive sales			0
