one father , whose daughter suffered vomiting and dizziness , expressed his disbelief that a child had been given the spray in the first place			1
he said : ' it is ridiculous that the school are allowing a girl so young to be prescribed something this dangerous			2
i agree they should be giving them advice , but she is only 12			2
' it could have been a lot more serious , one of them could have been seriously poisoned			0
' a mother , who also asked not to be named , said her 12 - year - old son tried the spray , adding : ' when he was collected he was extremely pale , holding on to the rail outside and some of the others had been sick			1
he 's suffered a toxic overdose			0
' it is understood one pupil even attended the @entity66 's @entity65 for a heart check - up			0
but despite parents ' concerns , the school 's headmaster @entity68 appeared to downplay the ' regrettable ' incident as a practical joke			2

he added : ' all pupils who request support receive an appointment , after which they are required to do some preparation for a quit attempt			0
medication is only recommended at the following appointment			0
' mr @entity68 defended the course , saying that as most of the school 's pupils are underage , ' smoking is illegal , which we take very seriously '			0
@entity112 , which makes the spray , says it is safe for adults and children over 12			2
but the electronic @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , whose information is vetted by regulators , warns : ' products containing nicotine should not be left where they may be misused , handled or ingested by children			0
