@entity7 , 21 , was undergoing exploratory tests in hospital to find out why she and her fiancé had been unable to conceive a baby when she was given the devastating news that she may never be a mother			1
she was stunned to be told her infertility had been caused by an std she had contracted and been treated for as a teenager			2
@entity7 , 21 , caught chlamydia when she was 16			1
when she started trying for a baby with her fiancé @entity18 , 30 , she found the disease had left her infertile now , as she struggles to raise money for @entity22 , ms @entity7 has made the brave decision to talk about her heartbreak in the hope that it will stop other teenagers from repeating her mistake			1
she said : ‘ i was young and i made one foolish mistake that i will pay for forever			2
‘ that single mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life and i want other young women to know that when they have unprotected sex they are dicing with their future and their fertility			0
‘ my dreams have been destroyed because of something that happened five years ago but i want to talk about it to stop it happening to anyone else			0
’ ms @entity7 thought she was being sensible when she protected herself against pregnancy before sleeping with a partner when she was 16			1
but after going for an @entity44 test she was told she had contracted chlamydia			2
she was treated with antibiotics and put it behind her			1
she says : ‘ i ’d learned a horrible lesson at a young age , but what young woman does n’t make mistakes ? ‘ i put it behind me and vowed it would never happen again			0
’ ms @entity7 had treatment when she was 16 and thought she was cured			1
when she struggled to conceive tests revealed her fallopian tubes were irreversibly damaged but ms @entity7 was unaware that the damage had already been done			1
it was n’t until she met @entity18 through her work in a care home , that she was to discover just how much her life had been affected by one mistake			1
the couple quickly became serious and mr @entity18 proposed			1
when they moved into their own home in @entity67 , @entity68 , the couple started trying for a baby			2
but after a year with no joy @entity7 saw her gp in april 2012			1
ms @entity7 and her fiancé are now trying to raise the money needed to pay for @entity22 treatment blood tests came back normal so she was referred to a gynaecologist in june 2012			1
she underwent a series of ultrasounds and x-rays in october 2012 , which revealed blockages in her tubes			0
ms @entity7 said : ‘ i was stunned when they told us what they had found , but was not prepared at all when they said it was usually caused by chlamydia			1
i had n’t even told @entity18 about it because it had happened so long ago , i thought it was in the past			1
’ but now it was affecting her future dreams of motherhood and ms @entity7 was told she was infertile			1
‘ i broke down and cried			0
i just could n’t believe it			0
i was ashamed , embarrassed and shocked			0
‘ i thought because i had been treated i would be fine but the consultant said the damage had likely already been done			1
’ their only hope of a family lies in @entity22 but as mr @entity18 had a daughter with an ex-partner the couple do not qualify for treatment on the @entity108			1
after being dealt the bombshell ms @entity7 suffered with depression			1
she said : ‘ i was just blaming myself every day and wishing i could turn back the clock			0
’ after researching her condition she read about an operation , which could help to unblock her tubes and increase her chances of becoming pregnant			0
her gp explained there was just a 15 per cent chance it would work but gave the go ahead			0
ms @entity7 underwent the operation in january this year but has still not become pregnant			2
ms @entity7 wants to raise awareness about the dangers of unprotected sex as she says she regrets her decision every day and does n't want other teenagers to make the same mistake ‘ they managed to partially unblock the right tube but the left was too badly damaged , ’ she explains			2
‘ there is still a tiny chance i might fall pregnant so i cling to that but i know deep down the only real chance is likely @entity22			2
’ ms @entity7 applied to take part in an egg sharing scheme but was rejected because of the @entity44 at between £ 4,000 and £ 6,000 per cycle the couple are now fundraising to pay for @entity22			1
she says : ‘ after the bills there is hardly anything left to save so i ’m doing what i can to raise the money including car boot sales			0
ms @entity7 has also started a @entity144 page to spread her warning to as many teens as possible			2
ms @entity7 said : ' every day i regret the decision i made as a teenager but i know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and i want to save them this heartbreak ' ‘ i think it ’s unfair that i do n’t qualify for help on the @entity108 because my partner already has a child			1
that should n’t stop me from being a mum			0
i would like to see that rule reviewed			0
‘ every day i regret the decision i made as a teenager but i know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and i want to save them this heartbreak			0
‘ i know there are people who will judge me , but we all make mistakes and nobody regrets it more than me			0
‘ i wish i had never had unprotected sex and i wish i had known the full extent of the damage that can be caused			0
‘ i ’m praying for a miracle and hope that one day i will get the chance to be a mother			0
‘ in the meantime i will do what i can to help other women by raising awareness			0
’ if it is not treated , chlamydia can cause long - term problems			2
in women it can spread to the womb , ovaries and fallopian tubes - this can cause a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease ( @entity193 )			1
@entity193 can cause infertility and persistent pelvic pain			0
it also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy			0
@entity200 can also spread to cause inflammation in the fallopian tubes - this can make it difficult for an egg to travel from the ovary to the womb making conception more difficult			1

if left untreated , it can lead to infertility .			0
