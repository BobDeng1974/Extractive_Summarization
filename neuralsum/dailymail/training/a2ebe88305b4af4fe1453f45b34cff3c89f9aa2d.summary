by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 23 january 2013 @entity1 was widely praised for her live rendition of the @entity3 at the inauguration ceremony but now it appears that her performance may have been lip synched			1
a spokesman for the @entity9 who provided the musical accompaniment for the song said midday tuesday that she did not in fact sing in real time , instead opting for a pre-recorded track of the song			1
hours later , a @entity9 spokesman backed off the claim and insisted he did n't know one way or the other , ' no one in the @entity9 is in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded			1
earlier tuesday master sgt. @entity21 said the band was notified at the last minute that @entity1 would use a pre-recorded voice track			1
instead they used a pre-recorded track for the band 's portion of the song			1
' regarding ms. @entity55 's vocal performance , ' @entity41 's statement continued , ' no one in the @entity9 is in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded			1
' a representative for @entity1 did not respond to requests for comment			2
@entity61 declined to answer further questions			0
earlier in the day , she told the @entity63 that the rest of the inaugural performance was live and they did not know why a recorded track was used for the national anthem			2
' it 's not because @entity1 ca n't sing			1
we all know @entity1 can sing			2
we all know the @entity9 can play , ' she said			2
the news that @entity1 may been lip synching comes as a shock since she went to such an effort to pretend as if she was singing live			2
hints of a lie : @entity1 posted multiple pictures to her blog of the process by which she recorded the track better inside ? it was revealed today that it was @entity1 's choice whether or not to use the recorded track behind the scenes : the track was recorded with the @entity9 , and even they did not actually play at the ceremony the most dramatic moment came when the grammy - winner ripped out her earpiece mid-song - a move that many singers do when the bounceback in the sound system goes haywire and they are unable to hear themselves correctly			1
members of the @entity9 confirmed that @entity1 did not spend more than one night preparing for the event , as she only spent the night before the monday performance in the capital			1
by contrast , @entity99 flew in several days earlier - and she ended up performing live rather than using the pre-recorded track that she made with the band			1
' we had @entity99 in over the weekend to rehearse and record			0
@entity1 , she 's getting ready for the @entity106 , so we did n't have a chance to do anything with her until last night so it 's a very , very tight window of opportunity , ' @entity9 director colonel @entity105 told @entity110			1
' as soon as we get information from the presidential inaugural committee who the guest artists are going to be , we make contact with them , find out how we can prepare arrangements that will really kind of flatter their voices — of course in the right key			0
' @entity1 did not stay around to soak in the immediate praise from the performance either , as she reportedly flew back to @entity124 on monday evening to return to @entity106 preparations			1
though the millions of people who watched the inauguration were kept in the dark about the fake performance , many in the audience apparently knew that something was awry			0
raw talent : @entity99 , who performed @entity133 , sang live during the ceremony and opted against using the pre-recorded track that she also had as an option friendly competition : @entity99 posted this picture to @entity139 , being very complimentary of @entity1 lip synching songs is tool that strikes a controversial chord among @entity143 it is generally accepted at certain large outdoor events ( like the inauguration , say ) because weather conditions can be contentious and techincal difficulties could ruin the show			1
that said , many performers consider it to be ' cheating ' as fans expect that to hear a live performance			0
@entity155 and @entity156 have an infamous , long - standing fued started when he was repulsed by the fact that she won the @entity160 for best live act in 2004			0
' since when has lip - synching been live ? ' he said in response to her win			0
that same year , @entity166 famously flubbed when it was revealed that she was lip - synching because she pretended to sing when the wrong track was playing			0
after initially blaming her band , she later admitted that she had acid reflux and had been advised by her doctor not to use her voice			0
the @entity174 reports that many members of the press - who were seated directly below the podium where @entity1 was ' singing ' - observed that the musicians in the @entity9 were not actually playing their instruments during the song			1
instead , they were pretending blow into their instruments , even as their conductor carried on by visually directing the band			0
his performance , however , was mostly for the cameras			0
even @entity1 hinted that she would not be performing live as she posted a series of pictures of herself singing the @entity31 in a recording studio with the @entity9 in the days leading up to the ceremony			1
the @entity191 confirmed the rumor and spoke directly to an unnamed spokesman for the band who said that inaugural performances are always pre-recorded as a precaution , but it is left up to the artist themselves if they would like to use the safety net or go live			1
@entity1 apparently chose the former			0
' we did pre-record it and it was @entity1 ’s decision at the last minute to go with the pre-recorded version , ' the spokesman said to @entity191			1
' this is our 54th inauguration … there is no question of there not being any music – it ’s not because the performer can not do it			0
' that is certainly the case when it comes to @entity99 , who performed before @entity1 and decided to forgo the prepared back up by actually singing live			2
the prospect of using pre-recorded music is not unusual : at president @entity33 's first inauguration in 2009 , famed cellist @entity220 opted to have the recorded version of the song blasted on the speakers down the @entity225 and played in television broadcasts			0
what was the point : if @entity1 was not actually singing at the time of the broadcast , then she would not have needed to rip out her earpiece as she did so dramatically in the middle of her performance nerves : the singer is a strong supporter of president @entity33 and has performed at a number of events for him in the past , most notably she sang the @entity241 's first dance at the 2009 inauguration that said , he still performed live in addition to using the back - ups			2
' a broken string was not an option			0
it was wicked cold , ' he said to the @entity63 following the performance			0
this is not the only time that @entity1 has been haunted by claims that she did not actually sing when she claimed to : in the @entity254 , she starred in a musical number with the show 's host , @entity256 , and many believed that she did not actually sing			2
the event 's organizers did not clarify , either , saying only : ' as is the case with any live event of this scale and scope , there are always elements of the show that are pre-recorded			2
but i will not go into detail about which elements were on this show			0
' calls to @entity1 's press representatives from @entity275 were not immediately answered			0
the singers ' next major live performance will be at the @entity106 in @entity124 on feburary 3 .			1

midday tuesday @entity9 spokesman said @entity1 opted to use a pre-recorded track and the band was also mimicking
late tuesday *afternoon* he backtracked , saying ' no one in the @entity9 is in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded '
@entity1 did n't practice with band until *sunday* night because she was in @entity124 preparing for her live @entity106 *halftime* show
