by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 19 september 2013 a girl with a facial birthmark the size of a grapefruit has been cured thanks to a new drug treatment			1
@entity7 , four , developed a pea - sized lump on the left side of her face shortly after she was born			1
the mass continued to grow steadily over the next three months until it was almost the same size as her head - prompting her worried parents to fear she had a deadly tumour			2
@entity7 ( pictured at her christening ) was born with a small lump on her face			1
it grew rapidly and by the time she was three - months - old , it was the size of a grapefruit but , following an mri scan , doctors discovered that the swelling was actually a parotid haemangioma , a large collection of blood vessels which had built up under @entity7 ’s skin			1
her mother , @entity28 , agreed to allow her daughter to take part in a medical trial in which she was prescribed propranolol , a type of beta blocker which is usually used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions in adults			1
incredibly , @entity7 ’s birthmark has all but disappeared , leaving just a tiny bit of excess skin around her ear			1
miss @entity28 , 35 , said : ‘ @entity42 really is a wonder drug			0
‘ it is n’t usually used to treat birthmarks , but @entity7 was part of a trial and it has been a huge success			1
‘ to look at her , you ’d never guess she ’d once had a huge lump on the side of her face			2
@entity7 's mother , @entity28 , 35 , initially feared that the growth was a tumour			1
she also worried that @entity7 would be bullied at school and that the growth might be causing her pain @entity7 was treated with propranolol , a beta blocker that is usually used to treat anxiety , high blood pressure and heart disease in adults			1
after two years of treatment , the growth has completely disappeared ‘ i worried she ’d be bullied at school but now you can hardly tell there was ever anything wrong			1
’ miss @entity28 , a nurse from @entity72 , @entity73 , first noticed a small lump on @entity7 ’s face when her little girl was just two - weeks - old			1
concerned , she consulted her midwife , who reassured her it was a benign birthmark and was nothing to worry about			0
but soon the lump had swelled alarmingly to the size of a golf ball and had become hot and pulsating			2
the swelling was a parotid haemangioma - a large collection of blood vessels which had built up under @entity7 's skin			1
@entity7 is pictured shortly after her birth since her treatment , @entity7 has been left with nothing other than a little bit of excess skin around her ear miss @entity28 said : ‘ it was like @entity7 was growing a second head			1
the birthmark seemed to be growing overnight			0
‘ it had made her mouth and eye droop			0
when we had her christened at three - months - old , it was the size of a grapefruit			1
the skin around it had started to split			0
it was dry , cracked , red and oozing pus			0
i worried that it would never stop growing			0

when we had her christened at three - months - old , it was the size of a grapefruit ' ‘ what ’s worse , she was struggling to feed			1
sometimes she could n’t swallow and she ’d stop breathing			0
‘ it was terrifying and i was scared it was all because of the huge lump on her face			2
’ @entity7 was rushed to @entity122 at four - months - old after she went limp during a feed			1
she was transferred to @entity125 where doctors carried out tests			0
miss @entity28 said : ' @entity42 really is a wonder drug			0
it is n't usually used to treat birthmarks , but @entity7 was part of a trial and it has been a huge success ' here , it was confirmed she had gag reflex problems , explaining her difficulty breathing			2
however , a consultant reassured miss @entity28 and @entity7 ’s father , @entity138 , that the lump on her face was unrelated and was n’t causing @entity7 any pain			1
miss @entity28 said : ‘ we were relieved when the doctors said it was a birthmark and could n’t hurt @entity7			2
miss @entity28 said she worried that the lump would never stop growing but a doctor reassured her that it would not cause @entity7 serious medical problems ‘ it had been blocking her ear , which had caused some hearing problems , but it was n’t expected to have any long - term effects			2
‘ they assured us that it was stop growing eventually , but it seemed to be getting bigger , not smaller			0
’ @entity156 , often known as strawberry birthmarks , are usually treated using steroids , with varying degrees of success			0
but doctors instead suggested they treat @entity7 with a course of propranolol in a bid to stem the blood flow through her birthmark			1
the drug is usually used to treat patients with thyroid problems and heart disease , but is currently being trialled on children with similar types of birthmark to @entity7			1
miss @entity28 was delighted when she noticed that the birthmark had begun to shrink almost immediately			2
after two years of medication , @entity7 recently stopped taking propranolol when her birthmark disappeared almost completely			1
although miss @entity28 was warned the lump may reappear , @entity7 has shown no signs of a relapse			2
miss @entity28 said : ‘ i have told @entity7 about her birthmark and shown her photos of her as a little girl , just so she knows what she ’s been through			2
‘ she takes it all in her stride though			0
sometimes at dinner , she makes me laugh by pushing her food to one side of her mouth and pretending the lump has returned			0
the growth was blocking @entity7 's ear causing her to have some hearing problems			1
now that it has gone , her hearing is expected to return to normal ‘ if she wants to have the excess skin around her ear removed when she ’s older , i ’ll support her			0
‘ but she ’s been through so much , i ’m just happy she ’s smiling			0
’ @entity42 works by blocking the release of noradrenaline in certain parts of the body			2
when she is older , @entity7 ( pictured with her mother @entity203 , left , and grandmother , @entity205 , centre ) will be able to decide whether or not to have the excess skin around her ear removed @entity207 is a chemical released by nerves when they are stimulated			2
the noradrenaline passes messages to other parts of the body , such as the muscles , blood vessels and heart			1
it is thought that propranolol helps narrow the blood vessels , reducing the amount of blood running through them			1
this reduces the colour and makes them softer			0
the cells that cause the growth of the haemangioma are also affected so the haemangioma gets smaller			2
