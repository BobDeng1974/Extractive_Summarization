by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 5 november 2013 a group of students have been banned from wearing sombreros and fake moustaches at a fancy dress night because they might be perceived as racist			2
a sports team at the @entity8 had hoped to dress as @entity9 at a @entity10 until a union official told them they would not be allowed in with their costumes			1
students have criticised the ban as ' heavy - handed political correctness gone mad ' , as it also emerged that one person was denied entry to a party because he was dressed as the ' @entity20 ' member of the @entity21			1
@entity22 : students have been barred from club nights at the @entity24 , pictured , because their fancy dress outfits were deemed offensive earlier this year the university 's student union , the @entity29 , announced a clampdown on ' all forms of oppressive and discriminatory behaviour ' at its club nights			1
since then , undergraduates have been barred from events simply because of what they were wearing , while the hit song @entity37 has been banned because of its ' distressing ' content			2
@entity8 basketball player @entity39 , 21 , told @entity41 student newspaper that last saturday his team were not allowed to attend an @entity44 event dressed in stereotypical @entity9 outfits , after the union 's ' anti-racism and anti-fascism officer ' objected			1
' we were dressed as @entity9 which involved only a sombrero and a poncho and potentially a drawn - on moustache , ' he said			2
' i 'm not sure why it 's deemed racist , nor why the ' anti-facism officer ' needs any involvement			0
' would i be offended if someone came as an @entity59 ? ' racist ? @entity61 officials ruled that a sombrero was an unacceptable outfit for a night out ( file photo ) @entity65 , vice-president for sport at the union , wrote to the team saying : ' dressing up as @entity9 would not be ok since it could be seen as imitation of a culture and relate to a stereotype about the race of that particular ethnicity group , even if the intention is by no means harmful at all			1
' we are in the process of creating some guidelines which will offer more direction but in the meantime if you have a back - up theme i would recommend going with that instead			0
' from speaking with venues you would be asked to take off @entity9 - related fancy dress items before coming into the guild			2
' third - year student @entity89 says he was also refused entry to the @entity92 's club night when he dressed as a fictional character from a made - up @entity95 country			1
in an open letter , the 21 - year - old wrote : ' i was refused entry dressed as admiral general @entity100 from the dictator , because my costume was " racist "			2
unacceptable : another student was dressed as the ' @entity20 ' from the @entity21 , pictured ' i 'm still waiting to hear who i was offending , going as a character from a fictional country in a movie which parodies almost every country on earth with no particular bias			1
' last night , i met someone who had gone to fab with his housemates			0
they had all gone as the @entity21 - he just happened to be the one dressed as the @entity20 , wearing a head dress			1
' he was thrown out of @entity115 for being " racist "			0
i 'm still waiting for the guild to ban the @entity117			0
' the union said in a statement : ' @entity92 has a zero tolerance policy against all forms of harassment to include racism , ageism , sexism , ableism , and homophobia and transphobia			1
it is believed that some fancy dress can be deemed offensive when considering the zero tolerance policy			0
' @entity92 would like to reiterate that this policy has been put in place with students ' interests and safety at the heart of its decision			0
' we do however understand that there has been some confusion with fancy dress themes and we are working on clearer guidelines to help inform students â€™ decisions , as well as a wider campaign to raise awareness on these issues			0
' the guild was accused of hypocrisy when it emerged that one of its officers appeared dressed in a sombrero in an official video promoting a local joke shop			0
the university has not commented on the controversy .			0
