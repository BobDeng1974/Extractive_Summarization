@entity2 's @entity1 account has now been suspended			1
after going live tuesday under the guise of its @entity6 website , the official website of the terror organization , the @ shomokhalislam account was suspended sunday after just under 50 tweets			1
the account ’s suspension came only hours after a report critical of @entity1 remaining silent as to why it was allowed to remain online for so long terrifying : @entity2 has started its own @entity1 account first reported friday by the @entity16 , the terror group 's account was open less than a week before @entity1 pulled the plug			1
the decision to take down @entity6 's @entity1 came only hours after @entity19 reported the site was remaining silent on why the account was still up			1
' we do n’t comment on individual @entity1 accounts , for security and privacy reasons , ' @entity1 spokesperson @entity22 told @entity27			1
mr @entity22 then referred to the site 's rules barring targeted abuse or harassment as likely reasons why @ shomokhalislam was suspended as it grew increasingly bolder , tweeting updates about attacks , and even justifications for them			2
the @entity1 account was not locked or kept private , and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers			1
the website administering it is closed to the public			2
some of the postings , translated to @entity46 , were accounts of operations			0
others were religious decrees and links to statements on the @entity6 website and @entity55 videos			0
' @entity56 , the @entity57 today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial be them good @entity61 , and certain after @entity62 , ’ read one tweet			0
potential recruiting tool : new recruits belonging to @entity68 's @entity2 - linked @entity67 rebel group march during a passing out parade ' @entity71 from @entity72 burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross , the explosive device was detonated now targeting bus least the staff of the @entity79 of @entity80 in @entity71 , ' read another , before giving a death toll of 17 , with 35 injured in the attack			0
' the attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise			0
. source brother @entity87 , ' said the most recent tweet sent from the account			2
had it been allowed to remain online , it likely would have been subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny			0
prior to the account 's suspension , terror analysts speculated it was likely a shift in strategy for the notoriously cryptic terror group			1
despite well - known power struggles among different @entity2 factions , the @entity1 account 's administrator had pledged to remain neutral and focus on spreading the terror group 's message , according to the @entity104			1
had it been allowed to remain online , it likely would have been subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny			0
spreading the word : an @entity107 shows his @entity109 machine gun with arabic language professing allegiance to ' @entity2 ' organization ‘ we ’ve seen terrorist groups make increasingly effective use of social media , particularly @entity1 and @entity119 , in recent years , ’ @entity114 , a counterterrorism expert , told the @entity104			1
‘ not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment , ' he added			0
it also may have allowed @entity2 the capability to streamline distribution of directives or celebratory announcements			0
' if the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally , it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another , ' @entity127 , a counterterrorism analyst , told the @entity104			2
no reason has been given for the account 's suspension , but one only needs to look at why the site suspended @entity67 's account multiple times during the @entity144 mall seige			2
the @entity2 - affiliated terrorists also violated rules pertaining to threatening behavior or violence .			0

the suspension comes less than a week after the account went live
it also comes only hours after a media report saying @entity1 *refused* to comment *saturday* on why the account was still live
followers were mostly journalists and curious *onlookers*
