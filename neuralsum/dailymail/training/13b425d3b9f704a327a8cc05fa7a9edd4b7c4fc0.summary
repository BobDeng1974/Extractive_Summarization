it has been widely acknowledged that the new @entity2 manager @entity1 has had a good @entity3 but at the @entity5 on sunday night there might yet be one player who could embarrass him , even though @entity7 departed the tournament on saturday			1
@entity9 , the playmaker in the @entity11 midfield , is in the form of his life			1
although @entity11 ’s semi-final performance against @entity16 has been rightly acknowledged as an extraordinary team effort , if there was one player who provided the nexus for all that slick passing and crisp finishing , it was @entity9			1
but @entity9 is off to @entity32 this summer , even though @entity2 were initially in the forefront of the race to sign him			1
@entity36 was confident that the player would come and other sources at @entity2 confirm that there was an excellent chance of him joining			2
@entity42 ’s appointment saw a change in tack , however			0
getting players out of @entity46 is never easy but @entity42 , who coached there from 2009 - 2011 and knows most of the squad well — including @entity9 — was clear about his preferred players from their pool : @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity51 has since signed a new contract with @entity46 but recruiting @entity52 is still a possibility , though the uncharacteristically calamitous manner in which @entity46 have handled @entity9 ’s contract negotiations may mean that they do not want to let another star man go			1
for @entity9 has been something of an outsider , both at @entity46 and in @entity11 football , until now			1
even a week ago , as his influence on the @entity3 grew , there was still a sense of him having to prove something to those back home			1
‘ i hope i ’ve given a few doubts to those who say : “ you ca n’t count on @entity9 in big games ” , ’ he said			1
‘ i want to produce something special at this @entity3			1
influence : @entity46 's @entity9 brings traditional virtues to the @entity11 midfield ‘ i ca n’t afford to relax			1
world class or not , what is important to me is that i ’m at a higher level than i was a few years ago and that i maintain the level that i showed for @entity46 this season			0
i ’m a different player — busier on the pitch and more dominant			0
’ he has achieved all that and more with his performances against @entity82 and @entity16			0
@entity9 may well be the best midfielder in the world right now , which makes it all the more puzzling that @entity42 has not pursued the deal			1
it is always possible that once @entity32 became involved , @entity2 would have been gazumped anyway			0
but it is clear that @entity2 were a long way down the line towards persuading him to join			0
perhaps @entity42 has memories of the old @entity9 : the one who was blamed for letting @entity94 ’s @entity93 run the game in the @entity97 semi-final , which @entity11 lost ; the one who missed a late chance in the @entity99 semi-final against @entity101 when he came on as a substitute ; the one whose midfield tactical sense was questioned after the 2012 @entity3 qualifier in @entity105 in which @entity11 led @entity106 4 - 0 with 28 minutes to play , only to surrender initiative and end up drawing 4 - 4			1
certainly it is said that @entity9 responded much better to the more avuncular management style of his early coach at @entity46 , @entity111 , than the abrasive @entity42			1
indeed , until recently he never seemed to be part of the inner core of the @entity46 team and that is precisely why the club is on the verge of losing him now			0
@entity9 decided he deserved to be paid a salary ranking alongside the @entity46 aristocrats such as @entity52 and @entity120 of around £ 8 million a year , and went public in his observation			1
snub : @entity9 has impressed in @entity16 but not enough to convince @entity1 to sign him for @entity2 for @entity46 , that was a violation of the unwritten club code that you bide your time and work your way up the hierarchy			1
they offered him around £ 6m , seeing him as a very good club player but not one of the best in the world			0
although his coach @entity132 enthused about him , the club were continuing to treat him like a naughty boy , as recently as march , when the prevailing attitude was that he would be held to his contract until 2015 and then released on a free , rather than be sold			0
the logic was that they needed to make an example of him to other players to demonstrate that his behaviour was not acceptable			0
while some at @entity46 hope that they might persuade him to stay , that there is still a one per cent chance of getting him to sign up beyond 2015			2
too late , it seems			0
@entity9 , transformed from an outsider to the cornerstone of the national team , has settled on @entity32			1
it is an extraordinary example of mismanagement by @entity46 , though not unique			0
@entity150 , another star of this @entity11 team , was once at @entity46 before they let him go to @entity152			1
but @entity9 had all the credentials to be at the heart of @entity46 for years			2
he was homegrown , joining them at the age of 16 from the far - flung village of @entity158 , on the @entity159 in what was the old @entity11			2
born in 1990 , the year of unification , he is the first generation of ‘ @entity163 ’ ( former residents of @entity11 ) to have no experience the old state			2
his mother , @entity167 , was @entity11 badminton champion , a formidable achievement in a state in which success at sport was considered one of the most important criteria			2
his father , @entity175 , is a youth team coach with @entity176 and his brother @entity177 plays for @entity178			0
focused : @entity11 's coach @entity179 keeps close eye on @entity9 and @entity181 during training he burst on the scene at @entity46 , a wunderkind at 17 , becoming the youngest player at the time to make his professional debut for the club , against @entity189			1
he thrived under @entity111 , but not under @entity190 , and was loaned to @entity191			0
@entity42 recalled him but only under @entity192 and @entity132 has he prospered			0
he understands his role precisely			0
‘ i know that my job is to give the team clarity and security with the ball , ’ he said during the @entity3 , though the actual @entity11 phrase he used was : ‘ i know that i ’m predestined to give the team clarity and security			1
’ there is an intensity and seriousness about the way he describes the role ; it also suggests that however strong the lingering @entity207 influences of his upbringing in @entity11 , it failed to eradicate @entity210 values			2
though he left school at 16 and was not the most enthusiastic student — knowing that he had a @entity46 contract lined up could not have helped — he speaks excellent @entity214			0
as for today ’s final , despite the extraordinary nature of the performance against @entity16 , there is a little danger of him or any of the @entity220 getting carried away			2
‘ the feeling in the dressing - room was n’t euphoric , ’ said @entity9 , reflecting on the 7 - 1 demolition of @entity16			2
‘ we ’re all totally focused now on the chance that we have			0
we ’re quite clear that we have come here with aim of becoming world champions			0
and @entity228 are not decided in semi-finals			0
we know that it was just one game in the plan to achieve our goal			0
’ one more game and they could be there ; and @entity9 will be acknowledged among the world ’s best .			2

@entity9 has been in fine form for @entity11 throughout the @entity3
@entity1 is understood to have turned down the chance to pursue the playmaker
@entity11 face @entity243 *tomorrow* in the @entity245 final
