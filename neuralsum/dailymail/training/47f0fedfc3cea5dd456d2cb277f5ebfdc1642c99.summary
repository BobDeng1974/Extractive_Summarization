@entity1 chairman @entity0 has called for the transfer window to be moved			1
the @entity1 chief believes it would be beneficial to clubs if the window closed before the start of the season			2
but @entity0 knows a change is unlikely to happen with the @entity10 reluctant to make the switch			2
@entity12 : @entity0 was happy with @entity1 's transfer business but wants the window closed earlier ' if you spoke to the other clubs in the @entity10 they would all say it 's not ideal , ' he told the @entity19 ' we are all the same in our little league			1
' my ideal would be that you get your squad done and start playing and the window shuts , then you all know where you stand			2
record signing : @entity28 was signed for a whopping £ 10m as the @entity1 reinforced their forward line ' no player thinks that they might be moving and thinking they 'd better not get injured			1
' and players would not be coming to you saying they 're not in the right frame of mind			0
' we have raised it with the @entity10 and said ' close the transfer window at the start of the season '			1
' but they mention the @entity43 , the @entity44 , no winter break , the fact that @entity47 and @entity48 eat into the window			0
star signing : @entity52 international @entity51 became @entity1 's 11th signing of the summer ' all of these things mean we ca n't do it so we 're stuck with it as it is and everybody has got the same set of problems			1
' if we could do it i would certainly be in favour because it would remove a whole load of uncertainty during the season			0
' you try to get things done as early as possible but you ca n't			0
people talk about not doing anything until after the @entity72			0
' @entity1 brought in 11 new players , including record £ 10m striker @entity28 , as head coach @entity75 rebuilt the squad after they narrowly escaped the drop under @entity78 last season			1
and @entity0 insists he is happy with the @entity1 ' business since during the summer			2
he added : ' in a way we have had a major sea - change in the last three months because we wanted to draw a line under what had gone on last season and almost reboot it , start all over again			0
' we have tried to get the right type of player in terms of not only the way they play but also the type of characters involved to take us forward			0

@entity0 said that all @entity10 clubs believe it 's not ideal
peace says that he has raised the transfer window issue with the @entity10
@entity1 signed 11 players this summer including record signing @entity101
