by @entity0 defense secretary @entity1 told @entity2 wednesday that officials of @entity4 negotiating the release of captured @entity7 sgt. @entity6 told the @entity8 that ' time was not on our side ' and a leak about the exchange would sabotage the deal			1
' @entity14 is a dirty business , and we do n’t like to deal with those realities , but realities they are , ' he said			2
he revealed that the @entity18 had been evaluating different ways to retrieve @entity6 for years , and at one point they were considering releasing six @entity22 detainees but that fell through when one of the terrorists died			1
' since the time he went missing we 've been looking for ways to get him back , ' @entity26 said this morning during a hearing on @entity31			0
' this was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him			0
' saying his part : defense secretary @entity1 testified in front of the @entity38 wednesday over questions about the prisoner swap that lead to the release of @entity6 @entity26 testified at a @entity38 hearing that the decision to transfer five @entity44 , @entity45 , detainees in exchange for @entity6 was a tough call for president @entity49			1
he called the five men ' enemy belligerents ' who had not been implicated in any attacks against the @entity8 and said that it was an ' extraordinary ' situation			1
' it was a very unique set of dynamics we were dealing with , ' @entity26 said			0
one of the most tense exchange came when @entity60 congressman @entity59 from @entity61 asked why @entity62 has not been returned to the @entity8 and remains in @entity63 for his medical treatment			1
' you ’re trying to tell me that ’s he ’s being held in @entity68 , @entity63 , because of his medical condition ? ' @entity59 said			2
' congressman , i hope you ’re not implying anything other than that , ' @entity26 responded			0
@entity26 also said that @entity4 has committed to adequate security measures that led him to decide the risks of the transfer were substantially mitigated			0
chairman @entity76 set the tone for the tense exchange by accusing the @entity78 of breaking the law by failing to notify @entity2 30 days before the exchange took place			2
@entity26 tersely disagreed , saying that the @entity82 had given reassurances that their actions - negotiating with the @entity22 via @entity4 leaders for the prisoner exchange that led to the release of @entity6 - did not break the law			1
' i know that trust has been broken			0
i know you have questions ... i ’ll tell you something else , i have always been straightforward , completely transparent with this committee			2
i will continue to do that , ' @entity26 said in his opening statements			0
' that ’s what i always demanded of any administration when i was a member of the @entity100			0
i ’ve been on your side			0
tense : @entity26 said that it was important for all of the military service members serving across the globe to see that the @entity8 will make every effort to rescue them if anything were to happen ' the circumstances were imperfect , but you have to make a choice , you have to make a decision			1
' one such decision was agreeing to release @entity22 leaders , who @entity26 said ' are bad guys , there 's no question that they 're bad guys , of course they are '			1
' i know that trust has been broken ' - @entity1 , to the @entity38 other questions centered on whether @entity6 deserted and whether the @entity8 gave up too much for his freedom			1

' this prisoner exchange was done legally , ' @entity26 told lawmakers			1
rear adm. @entity126 , a @entity18 spokesman , said in advance of the hearing that @entity26 was set to explain why the decision to make the trade was ' the right one			0
' @entity126 said the administration had a ' very small , fleeting opportunity ' to secure @entity6 's release and seized the opportunity , he said			1
@entity126 's description of a small window for the agreement meshed with comments by senator @entity140 , a @entity141 , who told reporters tuesday that the administration finalized the exchange only a day before it took place on may 31			2
the release : army sgt @entity6 is now in the custody of the @entity8 government after being exchanged for five @entity22 terror leaders @entity140 , the @entity100 's no. 2 - ranked @entity141 , also said @entity8 officials did n't learn the pickup location for @entity6 until an hour ahead of time , making the question of advance notification irrelevant			1
critics in @entity2 were n't convinced : in a bipartisan 33 - 13 vote , the @entity156 on wednesday added a provision to a $ 570billion defense spending bill that barred money for the transfer of future detainees from @entity44			1
it also withholds other funds from the @entity18 until @entity26 assures lawmakers that notification rules will be respected			2
' we do n't negotiate with terrorists , ' house speaker @entity167 said tuesday			0
' we 've made @entity8 less safe , here and around the world			2
and we 're going to pay for this			0
' although @entity167 and other lawmakers voiced concerns when told more than two years ago about the possibility of the trade , the @entity60 told reporters he ' was never briefed on any specific negotiation			0
' @entity49 is ' not going to get away with this one , ' rep. @entity179 , a @entity60 , said after a closed - doors hearing of the @entity78 on monday			0
he described the president 's attitude as an ' arrogant thumbing of his nose ' at @entity2			0
@entity6 had been held captive since 2009 and the @entity22 officials who were traded for his release had been at @entity44 for more than a decade			1
under the deal , they have to remain in @entity4 for a year			0
