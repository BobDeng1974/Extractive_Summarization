several prominent conservatives suggested mr @entity13 ’s ‘ appeasement ’ of @entity7 , a staunch ally of @entity15 tyrant @entity3 , had contributed to the current crisis			1
treasury minister @entity20 , a close ally of chancellor @entity22 , said there was a ‘ direct link between @entity13 ’s cynical vote against [ the ] @entity15 motion and @entity7 ’s actions on @entity17 ’ , adding that this made the @entity30 ‘ completely unfit to lead @entity29 ’			1
@entity32 planning minister @entity31 said @entity41 ‘ was right to urge @entity36 to stand up to [ @entity7 leader @entity37 ] @entity38 and punish @entity3 ’s use of chemical weapons , ’ adding : ‘ look where @entity13 ’s weakness has led us			1
’ @entity42 , parliamentary private secretary to the defence secretary @entity43 , agreed that the ‘ car crash ’ of last summer ’s vote against intervention in @entity15 had a bearing on the current crisis			2
mr @entity13 and several backbench conservatives voted down a @entity50 motion on missile strikes against @entity15 last august , despite chemical weapons attacks on hundreds of civilians by its regime			1
in the wake of mr @entity41 ’s worst defeat as prime minister , @entity9 accused the @entity11 leader of privately indicating he would support a motion paving the way for military strikes but then changed his mind , something @entity11 denies			0
the @entity11 leader has since taken credit for persuading the world to turn back from a rush to war in @entity15 , since the shock defeat in @entity36 was followed by retreats by the @entity71 and other western allies			2
@entity38 repeatedly warned that any western military action in @entity15 would be illegal and threatened to prop up the @entity3 administration			1
@entity75 has since agreed to destroy its chemical weapons arsenals			0
some analysts say the failure to act against one of @entity38 ’s key allies has encouraged the @entity7 president , but have blamed president @entity82 rather than mr @entity13			1
@entity3 is a known ally of @entity7 and president @entity38			1
senior @entity9 said there was a ' direct link ' between @entity13 's vote against the @entity15 motion and the @entity17 crisis @entity82 talks on the phone in the @entity89 with @entity7 president @entity38 about the situation in @entity17			1
the @entity71 called movements today an ' incredible act of aggression ' former foreign secretary sir @entity95 agreed that some of @entity38 ’s boldness can be traced back to the @entity15 situation , when mr @entity82 insisted the use of chemical weapons by @entity75 would be a ‘ red line ’ but then failed to act			2
‘ it was one aspect of what has given @entity38 , he believes , the confidence to do what he ’s doing , yes , ’ he said			0
mr @entity82 spoke with @entity38 for 90 minutes on saturday			0
an official described the talks as ‘ candid ’			0
last night mr @entity13 dismissed the attacks on him , saying : ‘ at this dangerous time for the world , the @entity29 people do not expect politicians to be indulging in petty point - scoring			2
what we need is for all parties in @entity29 to put politics aside so we can find a swift solution to the crisis in @entity17			0
’ mr @entity13 suggested diplomatic and economic sanctions offered the ‘ best hope ’ of persuading @entity7 to back down and ruled out backing western military action			1
armed men in military uniform walk outside the territory of a @entity17 military unit in the village of @entity128 , outside @entity129 he agreed there was a case for looking at whether the @entity29 should boycott the forthcoming @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity7			0
‘ all of these options need to be looked at because we ’re in such a deeply worrying situation and because we ’ve got to protect the sovereignty of @entity17 , ’ he said			0
‘ the international community needs to speak with one voice to say that this is unacceptable , this kind of military incursion is unacceptable			0
it breaks the terms of the @entity144 agreement of 1994 and the diplomatic and economic pressure we can put on @entity7 is the best hope we have of what everyone wants to see , which is the de-escalation of the crisis			2
’ mr @entity41 said : ‘ there can be no excuse for outside military intervention in @entity17 – a point i made to president @entity38 when we spoke [ on friday ]			0
everyone must think carefully about their actions and work to lower , not escalate , tensions			0
