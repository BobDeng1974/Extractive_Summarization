by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:45 est , 24 november 2012 updated : 21:03 est , 24 november 2012 anger : @entity5 leader @entity4 condemned ' another appalling case of discrimination ' after a member was prevented from volunteering as a mentor for young adults by leading children 's charity @entity11 a row over two @entity5 members having their foster children removed took a new twist last night when another woman claimed she had been barred from looking after children because she was a party candidate			1
@entity4 , @entity5 leader , condemned ‘ another appalling case of discrimination ’ after former district nurse @entity19 said she had been prevented from volunteering as a mentor for young adults by leading children ’s charity @entity11			1
ms @entity19 , a mother of three , claims she told the charity of her political affiliation and was told it would ‘ not be appropriate ’ for her to perform the role , which involves supporting children coming out of the care system , because @entity5 ‘ opposes multi-culturalism ’			1
the charity said there were other reasons for ms @entity19 ’s rejection but refused to disclose further details			1
the claim came as two investigations were launched into a council ’s ‘ indefensible ’ decision to remove three vulnerable children from their foster parents because of their support for @entity5			1
social workers at @entity43 claimed the married couple ’s affiliation with @entity5 meant they supported ‘ racist ’ policies which made them unsuitable carers for the @entity49 children and there were concerns for their ‘ cultural and ethical needs ’			1
but amid widespread condemnation of their actions yesterday , the @entity54 - run council began an internal review , and education secretary @entity58 announced his own investigation			1
last night , mr @entity4 said he had ‘ no reason ’ to doubt ms @entity19 ’s story			1
he said : ‘ i met this lady at our party conference			2
we knew about this story at the time but she chose not to publicise it			2
she has now decided to make it known , really in support of the couple in @entity43			2
because of all that , i believe her story is genuine			2
’ separately , @entity5 officials said ms @entity19 informed them of her problems with @entity75 ’s several months ago			1
the latest claim emerged in a series of posts ms @entity19 , who stood as a @entity5 candidate for @entity80 in may ’s elections , made on @entity82			1
response : the charity said there were other reasons for ms @entity19 's rejection but refused to disclose further details she wrote : ‘ @entity11 would not allow me to be a volunteer befriender of young people leaving care when i told them i was standing for @entity5			1
@entity75 ’s rationale for this was that “ @entity5 opposes multi-culturalism ”			1
’ responding to a @entity95 reporter , she wrote : ‘ i ’d almost gone through their process and been accepted when i told them i ’d be standing for @entity5 in locals			1
they checked with managers , discussed it , could n’t accept me due to issue of multi-culturalism			2
‘ their rationale was that because @entity5 opposes multi-culturalism it would not be appropriate for me to mentor young people coming out of the care system			1
my argument was that , yes , i do oppose forced marriage and female genital mutilation and family killings but that does not make me unsuitable to befriend young people			2
’ @entity19 said the charity told her it would ‘ not be appropriate ’ for her to perform the role @entity75 ’s denied ‘ blanket banning ’ any applicant			1
it said : ‘ the needs of the child must be paramount when making any decision about matching them with carers and the most important thing is to provide a loving and supportive environment			2
people from all backgrounds work and volunteer for @entity75 ’s but there are many factors to take into consideration when assessing suitability to work with children or young people			2
cultural context is relevant , but so are family background , health , and any previous experience			2
’ the foster couple in @entity43 at the centre of a separate storm claimed @entity140 , the council ’s former director of safeguarding children and families , had taken the decision to separate them from the children in their care without prior discussion			2
they also denied claims their membership of @entity5 affected their treatment of the children			1
the wife said : ‘ we were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language and to teach us their language			2
we enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language			2
‘ these children have now been placed with families who are also white @entity164			0
how are these people going to meet the cultural needs of these children ? ’ the @entity168 said the decision may have breached the parents ’ right to freedom of political opinion			1
mr @entity140 was not available for comment			0
in a statement , @entity43 council announced an immediate investigation and said : ‘ membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children			1
’ labour leader @entity181 called for an urgent probe			0
by @entity58 , education secretary appeal : education secretary @entity58 wants more parents from every background to come forward to adopt i know how important it is to ensure you choose the right family to look after a child who has been in care			1
because i was a child in care			0
and i was brought up by the right family			0
my mum and dad did an amazing job , providing me with love and security , enabling me to enjoy wonderful opportunities			0
i can never adequately repay them			0
but one of the ways in which i ’m trying is my work to reform our care system			0
as education secretary i ’m responsible for @entity207 policy on child protection , children in care , adoption and fostering			1
just last week i laid out how big a job we face to get things right			0
if we needed any reminder of what we ’re up against then yesterday ’s reports from @entity43 powerfully demonstrate just how much change is needed , because children still do n’t come first			0
for years now , child protection has been crippled by politically correct attitudes that put the interests and ideologies of adults ahead of the needs of children			0
on the one hand , we leave children with abusive and neglectful parents for too long , as the case of ‘ @entity233 ’ @entity231 exemplifies			1
on the other hand , we do n’t welcome and support people who want to adopt or foster effectively enough			0
so neglected children are not rescued sufficiently early or placed in loving homes sufficiently quickly			0
a particular problem has been the way in which rules on ethnicity , race and culture have been applied			0
when it comes to adoption the perfect has been the enemy of the good			0
social workers have put the need to find a perfect ethnic or cultural ‘ match ’ for children in care ahead of the pressing need to find those children a loving home			0
so children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds spend longer in care , and get adopted later , than others			0
we know that the earlier a child is adopted the better , so these pc attitudes , allegedly designed to help children , only end up harming them			0
and that is why the decision by @entity43 council to take a child away from loving and successful foster parents for ‘ cultural ’ reasons – because they were members of @entity5 – is so especially harmful			1
it sends a signal to those who want to foster or adopt that they ’re not wanted if their attitudes fall outside a tightly circumscribed and politically approved set of views			0
that ’s offensive to any idea of a genuinely liberal society and a tragedy at a time when we need more parents to foster and adopt. and it ’s why we are changing the law to stop ethnic and cultural considerations being put ahead of a child ’s need for early adoption			1
i want more parents from every background – gay or straight , black or white , @entity297 or @entity298 – to come forward to adopt because there are so many children whose lives will be transformed immeasurably for the better if they are enfolded in the loving arms of kind parents			1
it is also an immensely rewarding choice to make			0
adoption means taking a child not just into your home but into your heart			0
it is a relationship which is – in every sense – for good			0
and there is no more generous gift you can give a damaged , neglected or abused child than a fresh start			0
