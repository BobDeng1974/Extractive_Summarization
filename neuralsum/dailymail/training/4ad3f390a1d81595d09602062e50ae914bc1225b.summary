incredible lost footage of an interview with one of the @entity4 spy ring filmed after his defection to the @entity6 has emerged in @entity7			1
in the film made in 1959 , @entity8 claims he is not a traitor , but admits to being ' a socialist , a @entity12 and a @entity13 '			1
@entity8 caused one of the biggest scandals of the @entity16 when he - along with fellow double agent @entity17 - fled to the other side of the @entity19			0
@entity32 is known about the pair 's lives in the @entity6 - which when they fled in 1951 was still ruled by the iron fist of tyrant @entity36			1
but an archivist in @entity7 has now uncovered an interview which the country 's @entity39 carried out with @entity8 in @entity41 in 1959 , in which he defends his decision to leave @entity31 for the @entity6			1
in the footage , filmed four years before @entity8 's death , he said : ' i want to live in the @entity6 because i 'm a socialist and it 's a socialist country and i enjoy doing so			1
i ca n't imagine living in @entity48 during the @entity16			0
' the disgraced intelligence officer struggles to answer a question about whether he is a traitor or not , stuttering : ' judging from the letters i get from people whose names i wo n't mention ... they certainly do n't think so			0
' he claims the case against him is ' hearsay ' and insists he and @entity17 only went to @entity59 as ' tourists '			0
the interview was filmed by a @entity7 journalist in 1959 but was put into an archive for more than 50 years @entity8 ( pictured , left , in his 1950s passport photo ) caused one of the shocks of the @entity16 when he and fellow double agent @entity17 fled to the @entity6 he insists he has no connections with the @entity6 regime , but backs @entity71 policy by claiming they were the only side trying to ' clear things up '			1
the film footage backs up claims that @entity8 became an alcoholic during his final years , spent cut off from the @entity77 in a small flat in @entity41			1
it is believed the appearance fee he charged for the interview - carried out in a cemetery in @entity41 - was paid in scotch whisky			1
he slurs his words at several points during the 10 - minute interview and waves a cigar about during some of his answers			0
wearing his @entity92 tie and a camel - hair overcoat , he says he would like to return to @entity48 to see his family , but only if he could be sure he would be able to return to @entity59			1
the interview was mysteriously not reported in @entity31 at the time			0
it has now emerged that @entity8 , pictured with journalist @entity98 in his @entity41 flat after his defection , gave an interview to @entity7 tv in 1959 , shortly before his death @entity8 was played by actor @entity102 in a tv adaptation of @entity105 's play , @entity104 the film was then archived under the name of ' @entity108 ' , a poet who was interviewed in the same programme , and so its wider relevance was lost until now			1
after viewing the video , @entity112 's official historian professor @entity111 told the @entity114 the interview would have been approved by @entity8 's @entity117 minders as a form of propaganda			2
he suggested that this could be the reason the interview never saw the light of day in @entity31 , where the media would not have wanted to aid the enemy			0
the ' @entity4 ' spying scandal rocked the @entity126 by revealing @entity6 double agents at the heart of many of @entity31 's most important institutions			2
@entity131 , @entity8 , @entity17 and @entity132 all met at the @entity23 , where @entity132 was an academic and the other three were undergraduates			0
the older man recruited the students to the @entity6 cause before the @entity137 - and they remained devoted to the @entity6 even after the start of the @entity16			0
@entity17 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) were also members of the infamous @entity4 spy ring @entity131 was head of counter-intelligence for @entity142 , while @entity17 was a @entity143 official and @entity8 worked for the @entity114			1
@entity132 was the most eminent of all , as director of the @entity146 and keeper of the royal family 's art collection			0
in 1951 , @entity8 and @entity17 were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by @entity131 they were able to escape to @entity41			2
despite the suspicion surrounding @entity131 , he avoided detection until 1963 , when he too defected to the @entity6			2
@entity132 escaped exposure for even longer - it was not until 1979 , when @entity154 named him as a suspect in the @entity156 , that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles			0
the ' fifth man ' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified , but was named as @entity161 by @entity117 defector @entity162			2
the story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times , including in @entity167 's classic book @entity168 and a 2003 @entity114 series titled @entity170			0
@entity132 ( left ) , the keeper of the royal family 's art collection , was exposed as the fourth member of the @entity23 spy ring in 1979			1
the fifth member was never formally identified , although @entity6 defector @entity162 named ex-british intelligence officer @entity161 ( right ) as the final link .			2

key member of @entity4 spy ring ran off to @entity59 in 1951
@entity32 was known of his life in the @entity6 , where he died in 1963
