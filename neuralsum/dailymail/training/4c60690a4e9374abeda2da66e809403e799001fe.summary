by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 will invite @entity3 for a post-match glass of wine in a bid to make peace with the @entity9 boss			1

’ @entity2 will offer his opposite number a drink in his manager ’s office but believes modern - day media commitments will not allow them the time to do so			2
‘ he ’s absolutely invited for a glass of wine afterwards , but those day are going , the time is so slim now with the number of jobs we have to do after the game with the media , ’ he said			0
‘ managers rarely see each other now			0
the staff have a drink ( instead ) ’			0
@entity2 , though , has seen his media duties cut back by owner @entity66 , who is instructing his manager to only do what is contractually obliged			2
that being the case , there may well be time for the pair to enjoy a glass of @entity15 red on sunday night just yet			0
