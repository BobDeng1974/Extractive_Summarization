by @entity0 published : 23:32 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 02:53 est , 10 january 2014 an x-ray telescope has captured the ' @entity3 ' in space			1
@entity6 's @entity5 , or @entity5 , captured the new image of a dead star nicknamed the ' @entity3 ' since it looks like an open hand			1
@entity5 has been circling earth since june 2012 , on a mission to gather more information about black holes in our universe			1
high five : one of @entity5 's latest pictures is of the ' @entity3 ' which is the remnants of a dead star about 17,000 light - years away ' @entity5 's unique viewpoint , in seeing the highest - energy x-rays , is showing us well - studied objects and regions in a whole new light , ' @entity22 , the mission 's principal investigator at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity21 said on the university 's website			1
this latest image is helping astronomers learn more about pulsars , which are the remnants of dead stars			0
the ' @entity3 ' is a pulsar 17,000 light - years away			2
it 's only about 12 miles in diameter but spins around about seven times in a second throwing around particles from the dead star			2
mission : @entity5 has been orbiting earth for the past year and a half on a mission to capture better images of black holes previous images captured of the pulsar made it look like an outstretched hand ( shown in red and blue in the picture ) , but this new image makes it look more like a fist ( shown in blue )			1
' we do n't know if the hand shape is an optical illusion , ' said @entity61 of @entity62			0
' with @entity5 , the hand looks more like a fist which is giving us some clues			0
' this new picture leads astronomers to believe that the fingers captured in the original picture are physically different areas from the fist			0
astronomers also released another of @entity5 's latest images , showing black holes throughout space			1
each dot shown in the picture is a different black hole in the surrounding galaxies , with the colors representing different types of @entity83 light			0
holes in the sky : another recently released @entity86 black holes in neighboring galaxies			2
the dots in blue are the new black holes @entity5 has been able to pick up on the red and green dots are what the @entity94 captured before and the blue dots are the black holes captured by @entity5			1
the black holes that shine blue are more actively feeding off surrounding clouds of dust and gas			2
@entity5 is the first telescope to capture black holes at such a far distance			1
the point of finding these black holes is to learn more about the evolution of black holes and the galaxies they belong to			0
' this is a hot topic in astronomy , ' said @entity112 of @entity113			0
' we want to understand how black holes grew in the past and the degree to which they are obscured			0

researchers released the latest images captured by the @entity123 telescope
one image shows the ' @entity3 ' - a dead star about 17,000 miles away
another image shows surrounding black holes
@entity5 has been orbiting earth for the last year and a half on a mission to capture better images of black holes
