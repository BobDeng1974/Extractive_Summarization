you can be forgiven for forgetting the name of that new acquaintance just minutes after you 've been introduced , according to memory experts at @entity4			1
scientists revealed that while memories can be recalled several hours after learning them , they are inaccessible to us for a period			1
although it is not fully understood why such lapses happen , it is believed to be because they are a necessary part of the brain 's process to avoid overloading with information			1
what 's your name again ? try as you might , information like a person 's name takes several hours to be consolidated in the brain @entity4 neuroscientists said that any disturbances during these memory lapses disrupt the process and stop memories being formed			1
one of the experts , dr @entity28 , said : ' scientists have long wondered why the brain shows these memory lapses			2
' @entity33 formation is an energy - consuming process			0
' the brain would need to decide if it was worth expending energy for the consolidation of that particular memory			0
' the brain has a restricted capacity to learn things and preventing some memory formation would be a way to avoid overload			0
' in his research , dr @entity28 introduced an unknown substance to snails ' diets to see if they would learn to recognise it as food			0
when they were fed again , scientists found the snails responded to the stimulus , with memory lapses after 30 minutes and two hours , before the memory became consolidated at about four hours			2
but if the snail received another different stimulus during the memory - lapse periods , the memory consolidation became disrupted , it was discovered .			0

brains are overloaded with information , say @entity4 scientists
