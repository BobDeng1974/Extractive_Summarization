by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:54 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 21:05 est , 28 november 2012 @entity2 said yesterday that @entity3 were a ‘ virus ’ blighting politics and that @entity4 would be a second - rate power if it left the @entity6			1
the former prime minister warned that @entity11 ’s policy of trying to repatriate powers would simply pave the way for withdrawal , which was being hastened by some conservatives			1
‘ the @entity19 have got it really bad on this @entity21 thing , ’ he told business leaders at @entity17 in @entity18			0
‘ it is a kind of virus that makes you want to take positions for the sake of asserting them , when a rational analysis says you do n’t need to be in that position			0
’ former prime minister @entity2 warned that it would be ' a monumental error of statesmanship ' for @entity4 to turn its back on @entity21 he said there was a ‘ chasm of error ’ between understanding that @entity21 was in crisis , and saying that the logical response was for @entity4 to leave			1
while @entity4 could operate in the global economy outside the @entity6 , he said withdrawal would be a ‘ monumental error of statesmanship ’ , diminishing trade relations with @entity43 and @entity44 , and influence on decisions about defence , energy and foreign policy			1
mr @entity11 has indicated that he wants to renegotiate @entity4 ’s relationship with the @entity6 , but is resisting pressure for an in - or - out referendum			1
mr @entity2 added : ‘ this is the last moment , the last moment conceivable , that we should start talking about leaving , about quitting the field just as the game starts , marginalising ourselves at the very point at which we should be at the centre of things			2
‘ @entity21 is a destiny we will never embrace easily			0
but it is an absolutely essential part of our nation remaining a world power , politically and economically			0
he added : ' all my life i 've fought ideology on the left			0
the right have got it really bad on this @entity21 thing			0
' but his intervention in the @entity21 debate attracted a scathing response from @entity76 , leader of the @entity4 @entity77			0
@entity11 last week told journalists a deal on the @entity6 budget had not been reached at a summit in @entity82 ' to hear a man who uses snake oil rather than milk on his cornflakes and was responsible for an illegal war talk about statesmanship is remarkable , ' mr @entity83 said			1
' to hear it when it is a merely poor disguise for a job application for the post of @entity6 president must make any decent citizen feel their skin itch			0
' mr @entity11 is under growing pressure from @entity100 mps to adopt a more @entity3 stance , having suffered an embarrassing rebellion when dozens of backbenchers demanded a cut in the @entity6 budget			1
there is growing speculation that @entity107 may be considering committing @entity108 to an in / out poll , mr @entity2 said it was not ‘ sensible ’ to be talking about a referendum at this point			2
the prime minister has ruled out an in - out referendum , but has proposed a renegotiation to bring back powers from @entity82 which would then be put to the @entity4 people in a vote			1
but mr @entity2 said mr @entity11 should ignore the calls from the @entity120 struck down by the ideological ‘ virus ’ of euroscepticism			1
‘ the right have got it really bad on this @entity21 thing , ’ he said			0
he said talk of renegotiating @entity6 membership ‘ is the refuge of those who want to leave but want to persuade people that really it ’s just an adjustment of our relationship ’			2
he went on : ‘ here it is no longer good enough for us @entity135 to claim that the case for departure is made only by atavistic @entity139 , or to pretend that outside the @entity6 , @entity4 would collapse or disintegrate			2
‘ @entity4 could have a future outside of @entity21			0
the question is whether it should			0
we should ask , not : could it be done ; but is it wise ? is it a sensible judgement in our long - term interests ? ’ he said leaving the @entity6 would be ‘ politically debilitating , economically damaging and hugely destructive of @entity4 's true long term interests ’			1
in a globalised world that will increasingly be dominated by emerging giants like @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity4 needs the " heft " of the @entity6 to exert an influence internationally and support its own interests on issues like trade , climate change and defence , he said			2
and he said the @entity4 can best use its influence to shape the @entity6 by making clear it wishes to remain at its heart .			2

former prime minister admits @entity4 could leave the @entity6 but it will be ' hugely destructive '
@entity11 under pressure from @entity100 mps to renegotiate relationship with @entity82
mr @entity2 uses speech to warn withdrawal for ‘ a monumental error of statesmanship ’
