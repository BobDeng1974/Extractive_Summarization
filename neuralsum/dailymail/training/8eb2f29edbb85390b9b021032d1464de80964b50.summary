there are far more pressing matters to deal with , namely , can @entity9 really get away with turning up to conference			0
in a pair of skinny jeans ? we all know the @entity14 want to appear friendly , approachable , modern and not remotely nasty , so animal fur , @entity16 suits , big jewellery and other @entity20 garb obviously had to stay parked in the back of the wardrobe			1
question : can @entity9 really get away with turning up to conference ... in a pair of skinny jeans ? to be fair to @entity27 , there were mitigating factors			1
the prime minister was doing his bit already , trussed up in his regulation suit , white shirt and shiny blue tie but wo n’t mrs @entity37 from the @entity39 , stalwart of party activism and devotee of traditional values , not have felt a little shiver of disapproval at the sight of the @entity49 ’s wife in denim , the most democratic , and dare we say , plebeian , fabric of all ? to be fair to @entity27 , there were mitigating factors			2
the prime minister was doing his bit already , trussed up in his regulation suit , white shirt and shiny blue tie			2
and this certainly was n’t a ‘ conference appearance ’ proper — like that slightly embarrassing , cultish moment when the wife of the leader joins him on stage at the end of his speech , and everyone checks out the awkwardness of their embrace			2
but not even @entity72 at her most subversive , let alone the dutiful @entity74 or @entity75 , ever wore jeans in front of the assembled hordes of paparazzi at a conference			2
perhaps @entity27 is trying to take the competitive conference dressing thing that has sprung up among the leaders ¿ wives here , and in the @entity84 , down a notch ? perhaps @entity27 is trying to take the competitive conference dressing thing that has sprung up among the leaders ’ wives here , and in the @entity84 , down a notch ? however , closer inspection suggests the look was more artfully put together than at first glance			0
the jeans might have been @entity91 — the smart money is on the @entity93 , in indigo , £ 40 , and a fashion favourite because they are skinny but not overtly so — but they were a dark and crisp pair			1
new enough not to look like they ’d rather be at home watching telly			0
the chatelaine of @entity100 perked them up with a pair of ‘ vamp ’ shoes from @entity105 , high heels in black , nude and red , £ 39.99 , and a green top with a white collar from @entity110			1
no one can argue with a suit , but some out - of - towners will never view a pair of jeans as anything but scruff - wear , even if they are teamed with a pair of glamorous heels these three choices — @entity122 ’s mostly @entity121 @entity91 , @entity123 and @entity110 — are canny @entity125 choices			1
for all the wishful thinking in the fashion world , the ‘ struggling middle ’ rather likes seeing its politicians ’ wives in clothes it can afford			0
but jeans and high heels is a particularly urban look , a metropolitan fudge of comfort and effort , that may not translate to the grass roots			1
@entity84 magazine @entity141 has noted that together the @entity142 exude ‘ modern @entity144 posh ’ , where dark denim and interesting shoes are a uniform for the women , and the men generally stick to a plainish suit — suggesting their minds are on more important things than their clothes			1
keeping it casual : @entity155 and @entity9 arrive at the @entity156 prior to the start of the conference no one can argue with a suit , but some out - of - towners will never view a pair of jeans as anything but scruff - wear , even if they are teamed with a pair of glamorous heels			1
and even in the city this new multi-purpose uniform of the metropolitan elite has its limits			0
there are still many occasions — such as on the stage in that hall tomorrow , at weddings , christenings , funerals , court appearances and job interviews — when such a casual look simply does n’t work			2
being tall and @entity183 - trained slender , @entity27 looks extremely elegant in jeans and heels			1
most political wives could n’t get away with it			0
@entity189 , for example , always chooses interesting clothes and has an enviously statuesque figure , but the two times she has worn ‘ designer ’ jeans — a spray - on pair by @entity195 and a pair by @entity197 that appeared to have been spattered with paint — she got mixed reviews			1
the first pair looked like she ’d never get them off			0
fortunately , she did , because it was n’t a look that worked for her			0
her current rival , @entity205 , unashamedly favours £ 2,000 @entity207 numbers , but as her husband is the staunch defender of the one per cent that make up @entity84 ’s wealthiest citizens , we are unlikely to see her attempting proletariat denim anyway			0
while @entity27 ’s jeans might be considered a metaphor for the way the @entity14 are currently viewed : urban , smart , divisive and slightly laid - back , the pm ’s wife needs to be careful not to alienate the ladies and gents of the @entity219 — the bedrock of the party			1
so come the big speech tomorrow , do n’t expect to see her in jeans			0
almost certainly they will be supplanted by a more formal ensemble .			0
