follow the money : the @entity1 has been revealed to track wire transfers domestically and internationally when connected to possible terror suspects they also stipulated that all information gathered under the provision has to be completely destroyed within a certain number of years			1
this is the latest way in which personal information is being collected by government agencies , as earlier initiatives included @entity1 programs with wireless carriers like @entity40 and the @entity42 's work that was revealed following the @entity44 document leak			1
an unidentified intelligence official told @entity46 that there is at least one other way that the government has been tracking @entity14 ' actions that has yet to be revealed			0
