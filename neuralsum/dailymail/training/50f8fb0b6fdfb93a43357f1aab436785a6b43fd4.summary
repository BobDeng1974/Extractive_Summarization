by @entity0 an investigation has found that an elementary school principal in @entity3 who suspended a seven - year - old boy for chewing a @entity5 into the shape of a gun acted properly in her decision			1
however the boy 's family has lawyered up , and are threatening to take the case further			1
@entity12 , a second - grader at @entity13 , said he was trying to nibble his strawberry breakfast snack into a mountain in march 2013			1
but when it started to take shape he reportedly told his classmates : ' look , i made a gun			2
' principal @entity21 then removed @entity12 from school for two days			1
dangerous ? @entity12 , a seven - year - old boy from @entity23 , was suspended from school for two days in march 2013 for shaping a pastry into what his teacher thought looked like a gun			1
he has since left the school unacceptable ? this is a recreation of the so - called ' @entity5 gun ' @entity12 created and which eventually had him suspended			1
a new report says the school acted properly threat : the school sent home a letter with every student informing parents that : ' a student used food to make an inappropriate gesture ' @entity43 , a lawyer who serves as a hearing examiner for several school systems surrounding @entity46 , submitted a 30 - page report on monday agreeing that @entity21 was within her rights			1
' as much as the parents want this case to be about a ' gun , ' it is , rather , a case about classroom disruption from a student who has had a long history of disruptive behavior , ' @entity43 wrote in his opinion , according to @entity59			0
' had the student chewed his cereal bar into the shape of a cat and ran around the room , disrupting the classroom and making ' meow ' cat sounds , the result would have been exactly the same			0
@entity69 , an attorney for the @entity12 family , said that @entity12 may have had ' minor ' disciplinary problems , but suspending him was taking the issue too far			2
' it seems to me that schools need , with all their expertise and experience , they need to know how to deal with seven - year - old second - graders without putting them out of the educational setting , ' @entity69 told @entity59			0
' they need to deal with them rather than just throwing in the towel			0
' if they ca n't deal with 7 - year - olds , how can they deal with 17 - year - olds ? ' @entity69 said that he intends to file exceptions to @entity43 's report to the local school asking them to rescind the suspension			1
if they do n't , he will file to the state school board			0
if that fails , they will take the case to court			0
' i do n't see why this child should be branded in this way , ' @entity69 said			0
' it seems we have a lot of school personnel and they are unwilling to admit they went too far on that particular day			0
' innocent : @entity12 , who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and enjoys art classes , said he was trying to shape the tart in a mountain @entity12 , who has since turned 8 , finished the school year after his suspension and was transferred to another school			1
@entity12 , who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and enjoys art classes , told @entity117 45 at the time of his suspension that his actions were innocent			2
' it was already a rectangle and i just kept on biting it and biting it and tore off the top and it kinda looked like a gun but it was n't			0
' all i was trying to do was turn it into a mountain but , it did n't look like a mountain really and it turned out to be a gun kinda , ' the seven - year - old recalled			2
the boy 's dad found the incident ridiculous			1
' i would almost call it insanity			0
i mean with all the potential issues that could be dealt with at school , real threats , bullies , whatever the real issue is , it 's a pastry			0
. , ya know ? ' he said			0
the boy 's father said the school claimed @entity12 had said ' bang ! bang ! ' while holding the pastry , according to @entity152			1
@entity12 denies that his food art was ever meant to be a gun			2
@entity155 : @entity12 's dad called the incident ' insanity			2

second - grader @entity12 , 7 , tried to bite his breakfast tart into a mountain shape but his teacher thought it *resembled* a gun
the school claimed he said it was a gun but the boy denies this
@entity13 principal @entity21 suspended @entity12 for two days in march 2013
new investigation found she acted properly
boy 's family say they are taking the case further to have the suspension rescinded
