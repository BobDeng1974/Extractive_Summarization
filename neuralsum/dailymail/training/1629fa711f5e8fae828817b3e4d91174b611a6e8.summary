by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 24 july 2013 a mother of twins has told how shocked she was when her seven - year - old boys managed to rack up a $ 3,000 @entity5 bill , despite doing it through a free @entity8 app. @entity9 from @entity10 's , @entity11 , was on a trip to the @entity13 and had left her sons @entity15 and @entity16 at home with her @entity8 , so they could play @entity18 , an app she had downloaded for free			1
according to @entity22 news , after just ten days , the boys inadvertently maxed out her credit card and amassed a whopping $ 3,000 in charges - simply by typing in her @entity5 login password while playing the game			2
expensive : @entity9 from @entity10 's , @entity11 , gave her sons @entity15 and @entity16 her @entity8 to play with while she was away			0
they inadvertently bought $ 3,000 worth of game features by making in - app purchases innocent mistake : the boys ( pictured ) thought they were doing nothing wrong , since their parents had simply told them never to download an app without permission at first , ms @entity9 assumed that the charges meant there had been ' fraudulent or criminal activity ' on her card from the @entity13			1
but in fact , it was her seven - year - olds playing the game - which is one of the highest grossing @entity8 apps of all time - while she was away			2
the boys apparently typed in ms @entity9 's @entity5 password , and were then prompted to buy game features like tokens and gems which ranged in price from 99 cents to $ 99			2
beneath the purchase options in the app , a small banner reads : ' ( costs real money ) '			0
' that kept coming up consistently and they kept tapping it , because it 's just tap purchase , tap purchase , tap purchase , ' said the angered mother			0
she admits the it was her mistake for giving her sons the @entity69 @entity5 password , which they had to use each time they logged in to play the game			0
still , the boys thought they were doing nothing wrong , since their parents had simply told them never to download an app without permission			0
backlash : @entity69 is giving ms @entity9 a full refund for the purchases made , but some parents have decided to sue the company in a lawsuit that may cost up to $ 100million @entity83 costs : clash of the @entity88 ( pictured ) , one of the highest grossing apps of all time , prompts players to purchase tokens and gems that cost up to $ 99 according to @entity92 , @entity69 is giving ms @entity9 a full refund for the purchases made			1
the mother 's experience with an outrageous bill due to in - app purchasing is hardly unique			1
in september , a six - year - old boy from @entity100 , @entity101 , unwittingly charged £ 2,000 to his grandfather 's credit card by buying features within an app called @entity106			1
' they kept tapping it , because it 's just tap purchase , tap purchase , tap purchase ' like @entity18 , the game was free for the boy to download , but acquiring virtual food and coins within the app cost up to £ 70 each			0
the family , who also received a refund from @entity69 , only discovered the costly bill when the boy 's grandmother had her credit card declined at a grocery store			2
@entity69 is also currently in the process of settling a lawsuit filed by five parents who claim to have had similar experiences with in - app purchases			1
the lawsuit could apparently cost the company up to $ 100million .			0

in - app purchases let users buy extra features within an @entity69 app for a *fee*
parents are *increasingly* wary of the purchases , which make it easy for *children* to unwittingly rack up an outrageous bill while playing games
