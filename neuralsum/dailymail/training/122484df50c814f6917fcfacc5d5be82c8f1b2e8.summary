@entity0 today weighed into the debate on whether obese people should pay more to fly			1
the size 12 frequent flyer said she would be ' furious ' if she had to pay more to cover the cost of fuel needed to power a plane made heavier by fat passengers			1
' planes go in the air using fuel and that fuel is calculated on the weight of cargo and passengers			2
if we are all getting bigger then we need to pay more to pay for the fuel , ' she said on @entity19 this morning			1
@entity0 's comments came in response to the opinions of plus size model @entity22			1
she argued that rather than charging obese people extra to fly , airlines should make their seats wider in order to accommodate larger passengers			1
debate : @entity48 said airlines should accommodate larger passengers but @entity0 said they should lose weight who 's right ? @entity48 said a fat tax is discrimination but @entity0 does n't believe she should pay more to cover the cost of fuel needed to power a plane made heavier by obese people @entity48 , 37 , from @entity57 said : ' a lot of people i know have had quite degrading experiences in terms of feeling embarrassed when they have to ask for a seat belt extension			1
i 've never had an issue in terms of fitting in a seat so i think the idea of having to pay per weight is ridiculous			2
' ' i would be furious if my flight prices went up to accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger ' asked whether she thinks obese people should pay for a second seat , she replied : ' i do n't need a second seat , slightly larger people may benefit from it			1
what we need to realise is people are getting bigger - not just around the waist			0
' in the last 100 years people on average are four inches bigger so the airlines need to recognise that and be more customer - focused and start accommodating their passengers not just charging more money			0
' writer @entity0 , 42 , who lives in @entity89 , said she did not agree with @entity48 's view			2
she said : ' not all of us are getting bigger , i fly frequently for work and i would be furious if my flight prices went up to accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger			0
' opposing views : @entity48 said pay per weight is ridiculous but @entity0 thinks it 's fair she added : ' our society thinks we have a god given right to fly , to eat what we like and not to exercise and everyone else is going to pay for us , that 's just wrong			1
' @entity0 argued that rather than expecting other people to pay more for their flights or calling on airlines to provide wider seats , overweight people should instead consider losing weight			2
she cited her own example having been overweight as a child and that of a friend who she said has never felt better since shedding the pounds			0
she explained : ' i was big as a child and it does n't feel very nice			0
one of my friends used to need an extended seat belt ( on a plane )			0
she said the best feeling in the world is going from being clinically obese to normal weight and that not having to ask for seat belt has changed her life			0
' @entity126 recently became the world 's first airline to institute a ' pay - by - weight ' system , where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price @entity48 questioned where the line is drawn over a fat tax given a body builder is n't obese but still weighs more than the average person			1
' this is price discrimination , you ca n't charge a fat person more money for the same service ' she said : ' muscle is denser than fat so body builders and athletes are not seen as fat so it 's a fine line			2
this is price discrimination , you ca n't charge a fat person more money for the same service			0
' the debate was discussed on the @entity157 breakfast show after @entity126 recently became the world 's first airline to institute a ' pay - by - weight ' system , where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price			2
their chief executive @entity166 said this was the ' fairest ' way to charge travellers while addressing the obesity crisis - an acute problem in @entity173 's @entity172			0
another carrier , @entity174 requires its ' customers of size ' who do not fit between the armrests to purchase another seat			0
in a november 2012 report on the issue , dr @entity179 from @entity181 's @entity180 said that a ' fat tax ' is the way to price tickets ' correctly '			1
he said : ' the model can be technically and economically feasible to implement and its proper implementation may provide significant benefits to airlines , passengers and society at large , not just economic transfers			0
