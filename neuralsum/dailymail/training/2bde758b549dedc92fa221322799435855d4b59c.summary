billionaire @entity0 has opened up about his weight , telling an interviewer it does not hurt his feelings when people joke about his obesity			1
in this week 's @entity9 episode , host @entity7 asks the controversial leader whether he is offended by his portrayal as a ' big balloon ' in political cartoons			2
' well not at all , because i know a lot of people who are fat that have got great integrity and are people we can all love and have compassion for , ' @entity0 replied			1
' and i was n't always fat '			2
' we all know that physical appearance in the final analysis is not the most important thing in life , ' he said			2
@entity7 , left , is a vegetarian perhaps scarred by a mishap during filming where the mining magnate turned political mastermind nearly sets her on fire , @entity7 suggested @entity0 was no regular in the kitchen			1
' i think he has not been there that often before , ' said @entity7 , who headed to @entity0 's resort at @entity39 to be served a salmon steak by the billionaire			1
of course , @entity0 - a business owner , the leader of the politically significant @entity42 who is difficult to miss in the media - may not have much time to hone his cooking skills			1
not that he would confess it			2
' he claimed to have been up all night making the food , ' @entity7 told @entity48			0
' i would reserve judgement on that			0
@entity51 ? @entity0 escorts @entity7 around his @entity39 kitchen @entity0 whipped up a gazpacho - a cold vegetarian soup candid discussion : @entity7 quizzed @entity0 , left , about the effect his weight had on his politics ' far be it from me to insult any hosts of mine , there was an element of professional flair in the [ entree ] gazpacho [ a cold vegetarian soup ] that raised my eyebrows slightly			1
the interview did touch on weightier subjects			2
@entity0 himself told the program he saw the role of politicians as involving coming in for ' one or two terms and getting out of there			1
' and @entity7 said there was a question mark over his longevity in politics			0
' i think he 's there to make an impression			0
you can see that in the way he conducts himself everyday			0
' this being the man who is building a second titanic , regularly storms out of televised interviews and , just yesterday , flayed multiple journalists during a press club question and answer session			0
and while much could happen to his political position in the coming months and years , @entity7 neatly captured his way of doing things			0
@entity0 stormed out of a @entity100 interview with @entity101 in late november @entity0 is pictured here untangling himself from his tv cords ' you 're a public figure mr @entity0 - the public has a right to know , ' anchor @entity101 said ' in the mean time , i think he 's certainly embracing the " i 'm here for a good time , not a long time approach , " ' she said			1
in the cooking showdown , @entity0 also reveals his sense of paranoia about people 's loyalty , @entity7 said			1
' it 's a really unusually high degree of anxiety and paranoia , ' she explained to @entity48			0
' he told us that he does n't allow his staff to even be on the @entity122 mainframe of computers because he does n't want to spied on			0
' ' that 's a pretty unusual degree of protectiveness against surveillance			0
and that 's really interesting because it dictates how he deals with people and the government			2
' indeed , @entity0 is often spotted holding meetings around @entity133 at various restaurants and bars			1
on sunday evening , he held a rendezvous with his estranged former @entity42 colleague @entity137 at @entity133 's plush @entity138			1
in an address at the @entity140 on monday , @entity0 said @entity137 - a ' free and independent woman ' - would continue to vote with the @entity42 on most issues			1
it was n't because of anything he cooked			0
