by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			1
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
in this week ’s column , @entity0 talks about his controversial cardigan , why an old rift means he ca n't get along with @entity13 and how he was nearly scared out of the @entity15 studio ... @entity17 's @entity16 i hear my multi-coloured cardigan caused quite a stir when i wore it as a pundit on @entity15 ’s @entity23 highlights show on saturday night			1
i ’ve just moved house and half of my stuff is in storage , so i got it in the @entity29 sales from @entity30			1
i thought it looked ' mad ' ! it was bright , had character and personality			1
it ’s not like the dull , bland , boring clothes you normally see on tv			1
the other option was a @entity42 navy - blue v - neck sweater , but i suppose that ’s just not me			2
you ca n’t beat a bit of colour and a bit of positive energy ; i thought it suited me perfectly			2
what are you saying about my cardy ? @entity0 thought the knitwear matched his personality out of my league i was at the @entity15 studios from 2pm through to half past midnight - we were watching all of the games and then recording the show			1
in between games a young man called @entity59 who is the ‘ runner ’ showed me to my dressing @entity62 could not believe it			2
as i walked down the corridor there was a room each for the @entity68 , there was one for @entity69 , one for @entity70 and another for @entity71			2
the next room i came to , the name read : @entity0			2
i smiled , shook my head and thought : ‘ i am well out of my league here			2
’ high company : @entity0 had his own dressing room , like tv personality @entity69 ( pictured centre ) the ' @entity78 ' @entity23 draw about two months ago , i got a call from a man at the @entity23 asking if i would like to do the @entity23 draw			1
you know , pull the balls out of the bag			2
he said he wanted it to be on the ‘ @entity88 ’ theme			2
i replied : ‘ i think you want my cousins @entity90 and @entity92 , not me			2
’ but he insisted he wanted me to come in and do it			2
well , i ’ve admired , adored and cherished the @entity23 competition throughout my life , and what an honour , what a privilege , to be invited to @entity100 to draw the balls for the first time			1
i always thought they had former international players or famous people			2
i never played for @entity106			2
keeping his eye on the ball : @entity0 was proud to be able to take part in the @entity23 draw you know it ’s live , you know millions of people are watching and you just do n’t want to mess it up			1
it ’s straight forward , picking a ball out and then announcing it , anyone can do it			2
the instructions are : keep your hand shoulder level and hold the ball out for three seconds , then put in the tray			2
after the reaction from saturday night i thought the cardigan should get a second airing			2
i had a text message after the draw from a friend asking if i ’d got it ' buy - one - get - one - free '			1
i see that @entity133 mentioned it , too			2
i ’ll go back to the shop to see if i can pick up a double xl for him			2
the whole experience was amazing			0
watch out , @entity133 ! @entity133 may find himself with a matching version of @entity141 's cardigan if he 's not careful nothing surprises me in this mad world of football – except a spider ! my son @entity146 , who , believe it or not , is an extremely talented mathematician and qualified chartered accountant , is always on at me to get a place on that tv programme in the jungle , called ' i ’m a celebrity ... @entity152 '			1
@entity146 knows my deepest fears and how scared i am of spiders , mice , snakes , and anything creepy - crawly			0
i got a text late on saturday night from @entity146 , telling me a spider was creeping up my arm as i was talking about @entity162 on the @entity23 highlights show			1
i had absolutely no idea			0
if i ’d known a spider was there , i would ’ve been out of that studio in no time at all			0
scary times : @entity0 hates spiders and if he 'd spotted this one crawling all over him he 'd have fled the scene rich owners ruining the cup the magic of the cup was there for all to see at the weekend			1
there were 5,500 @entity179 fans going crazy at @entity180 , there was relief on @entity183 ’ face when @entity184 escaped from courageous @entity185 with a late win and the pained look on @entity188 when @entity162 lost to @entity189 was unmistakable			0
last week , @entity190 made a point that every @entity193 manager is thinking when he said the @entity23 is not as important as the league			1
but @entity92 could ’ve chosen his words more carefully			0
football club owners , financial directors , shareholders and stake holders in @entity193 clubs only have an interest in the bottom line			1
all about survival : @entity190 is not the only manager who does n't make the @entity23 a priority their priority is not silverware , their priority is to make money , make their club a global brand and cash in on the @entity193 tv rights deal			1
there ’ll be managers only intent in staying in the @entity193			0
there are a group of managers trying their best to get the fourth @entity221 place and of course there are three or four clubs attempting to win the @entity193 title			1
the @entity23 , for these managers and these clubs , is most definitely second on the agenda , and even third , for those competing in the @entity221			1
but for all the other @entity231 and @entity232 clubs it is the opportunity to go scalp hunting			1
@entity236 off with @entity235 the furthest i ever managed to get in the competition was the semi-final at @entity180 , playing for @entity240 against @entity241 in 1991			0
the referee that day was mr @entity13			1
he was a decent referee and a good man			0
however , after 22 minutes our centre - back @entity244 challenged @entity247 and mr @entity13 deemed it to be a straight red card			0
@entity241 knocked the ball about in typical @entity254 style and we lost 4 - 1 , conceding two late goals			0
but the @entity100 dream was over with that red card			0
dreams smashed : @entity13 made a mistake when he sent off @entity244 in the @entity23 semi-final to be fair to @entity13 , we had a good chat afterwards and he explained to me that he realised he had made a mistake and just how costly it was to everybody at @entity240			1
he was genuinely sorry and i shook his hand and thought to myself : ‘ fair play to him for apologising			0
’ not many people are man enough to stand up and admit they were wrong			0
last year , at the beginning of the season , i was invited by the @entity272 to meet the head of the referees to go through the new rules and regulations and ask any questions			1
i arrived bang on time , and a nice lady gave me a nice cup of coffee with a saucer			0
i pitched myself quietly on the back row			0
low and behold , sat twenty yards in front of me was their general manager , and he was introduced as mr @entity13			0
i could n’t stop thinking about that red card			0
my cup and saucer started to shake , the eyes got frosty and the froth and saliva was dripping down my chin			0
i never heard a word that was said for the next three hours as i sat there and stared out @entity13			0
not forgiven : @entity0 seethed all the way through a briefing from @entity13 because of this incident @entity300 ’s sour grapes talking of referees , i ca n’t believe @entity300 made a complaint about what @entity303 said to @entity305			1
he supposedly told the player he ’d changed since he played for @entity106			0
so what ? in all honesty i find it quite ridiculous , and respect should be shown to the referee			0
ridiculous : what @entity303 supposedly said to @entity305 was not worth mentioning the improvement in refs in the last 10 years has been amazing			1
with the speed of the game and the scrutiny through the media , it ’s important these men and women are protected and looked after			1
they do a good job in difficult circumstances			0
let ’s face it we have the opportunity to lie on the sofa and watch replays from the front , from the back , from the side , from above , in slow motion , and most of the time it ’s still difficult to decide whether it was a right or wrong decision			0
managers are far too critical of referees after matches nowadays			1
it should be stamped down on by the @entity272 , the @entity23 and the @entity193			1
referees have got a hard enough job as it is			1
distracted by divers referees are not helped by all this diving , either			1
almost 11 years ago i watched @entity349 ’s @entity348 take on @entity350			0
@entity351 , the @entity352 midfielder , was absolutely outstanding			0
he professionally played for fouls to break up the rhythm of the game and take away the intensity of the @entity358 supporters			0
he did this skilfully and craftily			0
by putting his body between the ball and the defender , and waiting for the player to make the challenge for the ball , he was fouled repeatedly			0
back in the day : @entity351 , left , was a talented player and had a knack for winning free kicks afterwards @entity369 , in charge at @entity350 , slammed @entity349 for his tactics and style of play			1
it would be something that the legend @entity254 , with his good @entity377 values , would have despised			0
@entity379 players know how to win a free kick			0
it ’s creeping in more and more to our football , especially when teams have adapted their style of play to pass their way through the middle of the pitch , similar to @entity390 and @entity391 , rather than just look to get crosses in for a man at the near or far post			0
it ’s here to stay and i ’m sure the referees will be clamping down on it and doing their utmost to stop it spreading through the game			1
no way : @entity402 was never going to win a penalty with this awful dive against @entity405			0

i bought the knitwear in the *boxing* day sales but it caused a stir
here 's how you have to act when doing the @entity23 draw
the @entity23 is being ruined by rich owners and clubs who have other aims
referees need to be protected and not *bashed* like @entity300 and @entity303
