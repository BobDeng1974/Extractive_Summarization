by @entity0 published : 02:17 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 19:17 est , 15 may 2012 religious : former prime minister @entity2 told a conference that religion is vital for the world he famously did n’t do @entity6 while in power			1
but @entity2 has revealed he had once wanted to finish a speech while he was prime minister with ‘ @entity10 ’ – until concerned aides told him ‘ this is not @entity13 ’			1
the former premier said the idea of using the rhetorical flourish that echoed the @entity13 presidential sign - off ‘ @entity19 ’ cause consternation among aides			0
he said : ‘ i had to do some address to the country when i was prime minister			0
' you know the @entity13 president finishes an address to the @entity13 people by saying “ @entity19 ” , mr @entity2 said ‘ i had the idea of finishing my address by saying “ @entity6 bless @entity28 ”			1
this caused consternation in the whole system			1
' a committee was convened , and we had to discuss it			1
' i remember we had this debate on and off but finally one of the civil servants said in a very po - faced way “ i just remind you prime minister , this is not @entity13 ” in this very disapproving tone , so i gave up the idea			1
' i think it is a shame that you ca n’t since it is obviously part of what you are			0
‘ i think @entity6 and religion can also be abused by politicians too so you have got to be careful			0
’ mr @entity2 also told a conference organised by a leading evangelical church that a world without religion would be on the road to tragedy and disaster			1
religious belief protects people from doctrines that put people in second place to political objectives , mr @entity2 said			1
vetoed : @entity2 admitted he was forced to drop plans to end a speech while prime minister with ' @entity6 bless @entity28 ' similar to how @entity13 president 's end statements with ' @entity19 ' he said that faith is ' fundamentally a belief that there is something bigger and more important than you , that you are not the only thing that matters , that there is something that is greater and transcendent			1
' i think that essential obligation of humility for humanity is deeply important , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
' it is what allows us to make progress , it is what keeps us from ideology or thought processes that then treat human beings as if they were secondary to some political purpose , ’ he added			0
the speech set out mr @entity2 ’s views on religion nearly five years after he converted to @entity92 shortly after leaving @entity93			1
his declared @entity95 beliefs caused controversy from his days as @entity98 opposition leader - when he was rebuked by the @entity100 leadership for taking communion with his family while he was still nominally an @entity103 - right through to the end of his premiership			0
mr @entity2 was at odds with the @entity107 over his gay equality regulations , which led to the closure of @entity100 adoption agencies which refused to deal with gay couples , and over his liberal attitude to abortion			2
@entity2 , who often found himself at odds with the @entity107 over his gay equality regulations , converted to the religion shortly after leaving @entity93 his @entity93 spokesman @entity115 tried to end speculation about the prime minister ’s religious motivation by telling journalists ‘ we do n’t do @entity6 ’			2
yesterday mr @entity2 told 4,000 people at a conference organised by the influential @entity103 evangelical church @entity124 that he did try to do @entity6			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ for a long period of time , what people thought was that as society became more developed and as we became more prosperous , that faith would be relegated , that it would become a kind of relic of the past - what kind of ignorant people do but not what civilised , educated people do			2
' ‘ i think a world without faith would be a world on the path to tragedy and disaster , i really believe that			0
’ he added : ‘ what is the essence of our faith besides all the things we believe , certainly as @entity148 , about @entity149 and his place in our lives ? ’ mr @entity2 told the audience that his ‘ journey of faith ’ had started in choir school in @entity154 at the age of 10 when his father @entity156 , a convinced atheist , had suffered a serious stroke			2
‘ i remember going to school that day not knowing whether he was going to live or not , ’ he said			0
‘ the headmaster of the school called me into his study and he said , “ i think we should kneel and say a prayer for your father			0
” ‘ i said to him , ‘ i should tell you my father does not really believe in @entity6			0
’ ‘ i will never forget what he said to me - he just said to me “ but @entity6 believes in him , so let us kneel and pray			0
” that made a big impact on me			0
