@entity1 legend @entity0 wants @entity2 to be the new power behind @entity4			1
speaking after @entity2 arrived in @entity5 this week for talks with directors and insisted he was confident of brokering a £ 16million funding package for the @entity10 outfit , @entity0 threw his weight behind the @entity13 - born tycoon			1
the former @entity15 and @entity4 skipper would like the @entity17 businessman to eventually gain control of the club - but is refusing to raise his hopes after seeing too many false dawns in @entity22			1
@entity0 ( centre ) joins radio hosts @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 at @entity27 in @entity5 ‘ it ’s good to see somebody like @entity2 , who ’s been at the club and knows what it ’s all about , in talks , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ ideally , somebody like him would come in but , until it ’s actually signed and sealed , we just do n’t know			0
‘ until i see it in black and white and it ’s done , then you can talk about it			0
things have happened in the past and nothing has come of it			0
we do n’t know how this will go			0
‘ that ’s the biggest frustration for @entity4 fans - my mates and people i meet on the street			1
one minute you think things are going well			0
the next minute it all falls flat on its face			0
‘ i do n’t think any @entity4 fans will be getting too excited right now			2
i ’m the same as the vast majority			0
until we see something happening , we ca n’t get excited because we have hit brick walls before			0
’ @entity2 , pictured here in march , arrived in @entity5 this week for talks with @entity4 directors with the club in danger of running out of cash before the end of the year , @entity2 is trying to convince the board to accept his £ 16m bailout deal			1
@entity69 with former director @entity70 and shareholder @entity71 , he spoke with directors on tuesday about his rescue package in which he would assume a 51 per cent stake in the club through a new share issue			1
but the situation has been complicated by @entity79 owner @entity78 ’s ongoing move to oust chief executive @entity80 and @entity81 as directors , who are both favourable to @entity2 ’s plan			1
@entity2 was a director of @entity4 for 11 years after investing £ 20m in 2000 and although @entity0 does n’t claim to be close to him , he feels he is the right option for @entity4			1
‘ @entity78 has done a hell of a job at @entity79 but if you ask the vast majority of the @entity4 fans they would want a @entity4 supporter to take over and that would be @entity2 , ’ he said			1
@entity0 had two spells with @entity4 totalling 11 years and was once captain of the @entity1 club ‘ we visited his house in @entity96 with @entity4 once			1
he had a lot of memorabilia but i remember the size of his wine cellar more than anything			0
it was massive ! ‘ i spoke to @entity2 a few times			2
we never ever sat down and discussed things as he kept himself to himself			0
‘ but what i do know is he ’s a @entity4 fan and that ’s what you want			2
‘ it ’s a hard one because about a year ago , it looked as though @entity2 was coming back			2
‘ i said then that we needed someone like him to come in , take control and put the club back on the map			2
‘ everyone is sick of it - from the fans to the players , management and staff at the club , they just want it sorted			0
’ @entity0 was promoting @entity27 ’s sponsorship of the @entity25 and @entity126 phone - in show on @entity128 , @entity129 and online .			0
