with its blend of old and modern architecture , @entity0 really is a tale of two centuries			1
it started out at the end of the @entity7 as a folly designed by architect @entity9 , but was given a new lease of life 30 years ago by @entity13 artist and property developer @entity14 , who built its large extension			1
the result is a unique property that is part castle , part modern eco-home			0
along with its tower and ‘ living wall ’ , it also has a roof garden and a secret door leading to a spiral staircase			1
@entity28 , 44 , who lives in the unique home with his girlfriend @entity30 , 43 , bought it for £ 990,000 in may 2012 after only one viewing			1
‘ who ’d have thought we ’d end up living in a castle , especially as we were n’t particularly looking for one , although i have always been fascinated by them			0
’ when the folly was built , it was in the grounds of the mansion that would later become the prestigious @entity51 girls ’ school , in @entity52 , @entity53			1
when @entity28 first saw the property , it required some renovation , but he could see the potential			1
‘ i knew immediately that i wanted it and we moved in after a couple of months – a lot quicker than we expected , ’ he says			0
the spiral staircase is like something you ’d expect to find in a @entity65 movie			1
as we walk through the kitchen , @entity28 opens a secret door – the front of which is a spice rack – revealing the staircase , which is within the turret section of the house			1
the staircase automatically lights up as you enter			0
@entity28 behind the secret door which leads to a spiral staircase at the top of the staircase is a terrace with views of surrounding woodland and , as the decking includes several glass panels , you feel as if you ’re walking on air when you look down			1
@entity28 and @entity30 use the terrace for dining but also have planting boxes there			1
‘ we grow various herbs in each box and the one we normally grow chives in became a nesting area for a mallard , which produced ten beautiful ducklings , ’ says @entity28			2
the spiral staircase has access to all three floors of the house but the property also has another , solid oak staircase , stretching from ground floor to roof level			1
the house , which has four bedrooms and three bathrooms and is on the market for £ 1.25 million , is heavily insulated and has solar panels			2
there are also triple - glazed windows throughout the main property , with double glazing in the top turret windows and in the building ’s conservatory			2
the large bespoke kitchen is modern with solid oak worktops , attractive stone floor and picture windows that overlook a pond surrounded by exotic foliage , including palms , ferns and bamboo			0
there is a meandering pebble water feature and duck house to add to the tranquil setting			0
‘ the pond attracts lots of species of birds and wildfowl and is a constant source of enjoyment to @entity30 and me as we love nature and wildlife , ’ says @entity28			1
kitchen fittings that form part of the sale include a large @entity143 - style fridge , gas / electric range cooker , washing machine and dishwasher			0
‘ we love entertaining and the kitchen is perfect for dinner parties , ’ says @entity28			2
another feature of @entity151 is its ' living wall ' which extends from the ground to the roof terrace ( pictured ) the main living room is light and airy , with a wood - burning stove			0
it backs on to the conservatory / dining room which has underfloor heating and overlooks the garden , which encircles the property			2
on one side of the garden is a large summerhouse that would make an ideal studio , office or gym in a relaxing and picturesque setting			0
another attractive feature of @entity151 is its vertical ‘ living wall ’ , which extends from the ground to the roof terrace			0
various species of bird nest in its abundance of flora and an irrigation system waters the plants			0
close to @entity0 is a park , which has a leisure centre and open - air pool , local cricket and tennis clubs , and woodland and river walks			2
‘ @entity52 has a great range of shops and there are excellent schools in the area , ’ says @entity28			1
‘ travel to @entity192 is also easy			0
’ the couple are hoping to move to @entity194 as they would like to have more land			0
‘ we ’d also like a bigger pond , so we can enjoy our love of wildlife			0
however , we ’ll be sad to leave the area and our lovely castle , ’ says @entity28 .			2
