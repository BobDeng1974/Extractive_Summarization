@entity0 said he got off the @entity2 plane because he feared for the safety of his six - year - old daughter @entity4 a father whose six - year - old daughter has a life - threatening nut allergy says his family was ‘ humiliated ’ and ‘ bullied ’ into leaving a @entity2 flight after asking staff not to serve nuts			1
@entity0 , 42 , claims cabin crew refused his request and were arrogant , snobbish and showed no empathy as he and @entity4 and his girlfriend @entity15 attempted to fly from @entity16 to @entity17 , @entity18 , for a holiday in august			2
vowing to never fly with the airline again , mr @entity0 said he attempted to reason with staff but a customer relations manager told him their luggage was being unloaded and ‘ we are @entity2 and we do not change our service for anyone ’			1
mr @entity0 , an account manager from @entity28 , said they had no choice but to leave the plane and book with a different airline that has previously accommodated his requests for nuts not to be served during a flight			1
when he arrived at @entity16 , mr @entity0 said he spoke to @entity2 staff who were not familiar with the company ’s policy on passengers with severe nut allergies , but told him an announcement on board the plane would be ok			1
he admitted he was not aware the airline serves cashews – which he described as ‘ my daughter ’s killer ’ – with its drink service			0
but after boarding the flight , mr @entity0 said his family was approached by the head cabin steward , who informed him ‘ there was nothing they could do ’ to help			1
@entity2 said on - board announcements can not be provided as they are not part of its peanut policy			2
however , the airline has posted on @entity59 in the past indicating that cabin crew can make an announcement about a nut allergy			1
mr @entity0 carries an @entity63 at all times in case his daughter , @entity4 , who was five years old at the time of the incident , goes into anaphylactic shock			2
he said one of the employees ‘ berated ’ them and upset his daughter and girlfriend while discussing @entity4 's ‘ chances of death ’ and the use of an @entity63 while flying 35,000ft in the air			0
his daughter , who also has a dairy allergy , still talks about the incident			0
‘ she still asks questions about it			0
she was scared after that , asking if everything contains nuts			0
’ as the discussion continued at the back of the plane , he said he was surrounded by four cabin crew and ‘ it felt like i was being bulled and ganged up on ’			0
@entity0 was ' forced to leave ' a flight along with his daughter @entity4 - pictured in an email to @entity2 , he wrote : ‘ eventually i was allowed to talk and said that i understood that they could not guarantee a 100 per cent nut - free environment ( no one can ) but asked if they would reduce the risks by not serving the bag of nuts			1
i even said i would buy those passengers that minded another snack instead			0
’ that ’s when he said he was informed that the request would not be accommodated and his bags were being removed from the plane			0
he said staff gave the family the option of remaining on the flight despite having no understanding of allergies , but he refused to take the risk and was further embarrassed after the family disembarked			2
mr @entity0 said a staff member marched him back onto the flight to collect his bags but he was ordered to sit down while staff ‘ checked the area for any illegals ’ and was then marched off the plane			1
he wrote in the letter to the airline : ‘ i felt like a criminal at best and a terrorist at worst and all this in front of over 200 people , humiliating			0
we were then walked to arrivals to collect our bags and left with no one telling us where our bags would come out and how long it would be			0
' luckily we were sat by the belt they came out of			0
’ he added : ‘ what we experienced once we had walked on the plane and informed the cabin crew about the nut allergy was not only unprofessional but a complete disgrace and embarrassment for @entity2			2
’ mr @entity0 said he was attempting to fly with @entity2 for the first time in more than 15 years after ‘ a number of bad experiences ’ with staff and delays			1
when they flew to @entity18 with @entity172 four days later , the family said staff did not serve any nuts and they made an announcement asking passengers not to open any packages containing nuts			2
mr @entity0 said the incident cost him around £ 2,500 and shortened his holiday by three days			2
in a statement , @entity2 told @entity183 : ‘ we are sorry that mr @entity0 and his family felt our crew were not sympathetic to their needs			1
‘ we do our best to accommodate the needs of all our customers , and our crew explained our policy and the reason for it			0
‘ we do n’t use peanuts in our meals but we are never able to guarantee a nut - free environment on any of our flights , as allergens could remain in the air from previous flights or customers could bring their own food on board			1
‘ we advise customers who suffer from allergies and need to carry emergency medication to inform cabin crew and those travelling with them , or sitting next to them , but we are not able to make announcements as we can never guarantee a nut - free environment			1
’ mr @entity0 carries an @entity63 at all times in case his daughter , @entity4 , goes into anaphylactic shock mr @entity0 said he and his partner complained to @entity2 but did not receive a response until three weeks later			1
he provided @entity183 with copies of two emails – one from a @entity2 customer service representative and a follow - up from the office of executive chairman @entity220			2
the customer service rep informed mr @entity0 that the airline received reports from the employees involved and would not offer a full refund because it was satisfied that staff had followed existing policy			1
mr @entity0 said he never requested a refund			0
the customer service rep wrote that @entity2 can not guarantee a nut - free environment , even with an announcement , because it has no control over what other passengers bring on board , adding that requests for nut - free flights are ‘ politely but firmly rejected ’			1
mr @entity0 said he booked with a travel agent and informed @entity2 by telephone that his daughter is allergic to nuts , but the customer service rep told him the computer system had no record of the conversation			1
four - year - old @entity246 ( left and right with her family ) suffered a severe allergic reaction after a fellow passenger ignored warnings from cabin crew and opened a bag of nuts on a @entity255 flight in august the email from the executive chairman ’s office apologised for how mr @entity0 was ‘ made to feel ’ and indicated that the employees involved have been offered further coaching			1
but the email informed him that the matter had been dealt with in an appropriate manner by the customer service department and he should no longer ' dwell further on these issues '			0
mr @entity0 called the email , which encouraged him to fly with @entity2 again , a ' disgrace '			1
he told @entity268 : ‘ i understand that @entity2 obviously have a policy for peanuts but what still winds me up is how we were treated by the staff and the total disregard for the safety of their passengers			2
’ less than a week before the incident in august , a girl aged four suffered a life - threatening allergy attack on a @entity255 flight after a passenger ignored staff ’s repeated warnings not to eat peanuts			0
the girl stopped breathing after the man opened a packet of mixed nuts despite three warnings that there was a child on board with a severe allergy			0
the girl , who went into anaphylactic shock , had to be revived with an anti-allergy adrenaline injection form an @entity63 and was taken to hospital for treatment after the plane landed			0
@entity255 accommodated the girl ’s family ’s request to not serve nuts and banned the passenger from flying with it for two years .			0

@entity0 said he was ' *disgusted* ' with the way his family was treated
he said staff agreed to make an announcement but then rejected request
@entity2 says it can not guarantee a nut - free flight , even with an announcement
airline *investigated* mr @entity317 ' complaint and said staff followed *protocol*
