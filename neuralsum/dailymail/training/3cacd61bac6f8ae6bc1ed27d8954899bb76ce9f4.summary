located on a commercial street in @entity4 's @entity105 neighborhood , this home was listed for a little under $ 1.2 million , despite being in ' poor condition ' ‘ it already was expensive , and a lot of these high - end markets were n't hammered as hard during the downturn because they were n't exposed to subprime mortgages , so they had less ground to recover in the first place			1
’ @entity116 , an agent with @entity117 in @entity4 , agrees that freshly minted technology millionaires who can afford to bid up a property until they win it with an all - cash offer are helping to drive up demand			2
but unlike during the city 's first tech boom in the late 1990s , the buyers prepared to lay down more than $ 1 million on a fixer - upper in a neighborhood within walking distance of shops and restaurants also include @entity133 investors and retirees from other major cities who already are accustomed to skyscraper prices for shoebox dwellings , @entity116 said			1
