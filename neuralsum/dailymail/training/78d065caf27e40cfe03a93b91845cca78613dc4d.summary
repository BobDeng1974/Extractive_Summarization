by @entity0 killed : @entity1 , 60 , died after a vein in her hip was severed by surgical screws in a botched operation a grandmother bled to death after a surgeon cut into a vein during a botched hip replacement operation			1
@entity1 , 60 , was having a second hip replacement at @entity12 in @entity13 , but after surgical screws drilled into her bones severed a vein and left her bleeding internally			1
surgeons were left defending the decision to use screws in the operation at all - rather than surgical cement , which could have eliminated the risk , an inquest heard			1
mrs @entity1 was especially vulnerable , the inquest was told , as she suffered from brittle bones and osteoporosis			1
at five feet tall and weighing around nine stone , she also had a slight frame			0
mrs @entity1 's brother and two sons are now considering legal action after a coroner in @entity34 ruled that the operation killed her			1
doctors could have decided to use quick - drying cement to replace her hip , which was itself a replacement from a 2010 operation which had fractured			1
but orthopaedic locum consultant dr @entity40 opted to widen the socket of her hip and drill through the bones , which left it at risk of breaking			1
the court heard this fractured her hip in several places			1
some of the screws – up to 35mm long - to hold the hip in place ended up passing through both sides of bone before a vein was ruptured			1
medics tried to repair the tear , but she lost ‘ a significant amount ’ of blood and later died			2
@entity61 dr @entity60 said she was given around six litres of blood in a bid to keep her alive			2
he gave the cause of death as a haemorrhage caused by the ruptured vein			2
existing heart disease may also have impacted her chances of survival			0
dr @entity73 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon , told the inquest that the proportion of operations which use screws as opposed to cement is around 50 - 50			1
but , he added , for a patient with softer bones or osteoporosis it is more difficult to use the uncemented procedure and there was a greater risk of fractures			1
he said : ‘ it appears the first inserted socket was loose and did not fit well when screwed in place			0
it was removed and the socket was drilled up and a larger one put in and in that process a fracture was noticed			0
’ he said the use of a 55cm socket for someone so small concerned him and may have left ‘ the external shell of her pelvis very thin			0
’ operation : mrs @entity1 was undergoing the surgery at @entity12 dr @entity73 described how a metal plate was secured to the back of mrs @entity1 's pelvis with four screws			1
drilling these in was likely to have caused one of her veins to rupture , he said			0
by the end bleeding was noticed , partly caused by the fractured hip , but largely from a punctured vein , he said , which was likely to have been caused by the drilling or a screw protruding through the bone			0
surgeons are supposed to ensure that screws only go into a ‘ safe zone ’ area and avoid them piercing the other side of the bone , dr @entity73 said			2
he added : ‘ if the screw is out of the front of the pelvis towards the vein it was more likely to have been outside the safe zone			0
’ medics realised she was swelling from internal bleeding while sowing her up after the operation and specialist vascular surgeons were brought in to stem the blood loss - but she died days later			2
dr @entity40 , who carried out the bulk of the surgery on may 2 last year , initially stood by his decision saying at the hospital patients under 70 would usually have the uncemented procedure			2
however , he later added : ‘ i perfectly accept if it was cemented it could have prevented the fracture and vein injury and that the cementless option has higher incidents of fracture			0
’ anger : @entity149 and @entity150 , mrs @entity1 's sons , say they are considering legal action in light of the coroner 's decision he added : ‘ the risk of this happening was very low , but unfortunately to everyone here it did happen			1
’ the hospital carried out an internal investigation following the death and have brought in procedures to try to prevent a repeat			0
dr @entity40 said : ‘ i am currently working on a system to drill into bones and avoid vascular injury			2
there have been some changes in practice			0
' hospital guidelines not do not allow cementless operations in any patient over 70			0
that would not have changed it for @entity175 , but it should minimise it			0
’ coroner @entity178 told mrs @entity1 's family : ‘ i hope you feel we have had a full and frank inquiry			1
the conclusion i reach is she died as a result of a complication of a medical procedure which was necessary to relive her pain			0
’ mrs @entity1 ’s grieving relatives said her death could easily have been avoided			2
brother @entity192 from @entity193 , @entity13 , and her sons @entity149 and @entity150 , from @entity195 , also in @entity13 , attended the inquest			1
outside court mr @entity192 said : ‘ this should never have happened			0
for someone with her history of brittle bones they should have cemented the hip			1
there are a lot of unanswered questions from the inquest and we will be looking to take legal action			0

@entity1 was having hip replacement operation in @entity212 , @entity13
inquest heard that a vital blood vessel was ruptured by surgical screws
she was especially at risk *due* to history of brittle bones and osteoporosis
*expert* told hearing in @entity34 that other procedures were available
common to use surgical cement instead of screws for vulnerable patients
dr @entity233 , who operated , admitted cement would have slashed risk
