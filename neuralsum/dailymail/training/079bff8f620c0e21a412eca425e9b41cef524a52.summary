in october 2007 , @entity1 chairman @entity0 travelled to @entity2 to meet the man of the moment			1
on this occasion it was @entity7			2
@entity9 ’s coach had won two @entity10 on the bounce and seemed like a good bet to replace @entity13 as @entity1 ’s new manager			1
a few months after his appointment at @entity17 , central defender @entity15 referred to him as ‘ a proper manager ’ when they progressed to the final of the @entity22			2
@entity1 chairman @entity0 has a tendency to appoint the ' man of the moment ' at @entity17 it looked like they were finally on to a good thing , but that has been said at @entity1 a few times			1
under @entity0 ’s stewardship , this man - of - the - moment mentality has become something of a trend at @entity17			2
they simply have to have it			0
shortly after @entity7 won the @entity22 at @entity36 with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity38 in extra time - the club ’s last major trophy - he was fired after a few dodgy results the following season			1
@entity44 was rewarded for his survival exploits at @entity46 and the victory over @entity48 in the 2008 @entity50 final by landing the @entity1 job			1
again , he was another man of the moment			0
even @entity53 , sacked by @entity38 in february 2012 , was still operating in the after - glow of his treble with @entity56 when he replaced @entity44			1
@entity7 was one such appointment and he won @entity1 's last trophy , the @entity22 in 2008 @entity59 , a former @entity1 player , was brought in from a decent position with the @entity61 to work as the assistant manager			1
@entity59 has since been moved aside and is working as a club ambassador			0
when things are going wrong , as they certainly appear to be at @entity1 , @entity0 will always make moves to appease the supporters			1
@entity7 was sacked by @entity1 later in 2008 which takes us to @entity69			1
the wheels were in motion to bring in @entity73 ’s head of recruitment several days before @entity1 were well beaten by @entity74 at @entity17 on november 9			1
earlier that week @entity69 had reluctantly been paraded by @entity73 at the opening of the club ’s new sparkling training centre , where he spoke enthusiastically about the future of the club			2
by then , he knew he was on his way to north @entity81			0
his reputation has soared in recent months and rightly so			0
@entity69 was part of former executive chairman @entity85 ’s vision for the club			2
the signing of @entity88 is , possibly , @entity69 ’s biggest success			2
during his spell at @entity93 , the @entity91 central defender was overlooked by scouts of @entity96 ’s leading clubs because of a perceived problem with his discipline			0
he was often suspended , missing key games in the @entity101 league because he accumulated too many bookings			0
to @entity69 ’s credit , he had watched @entity104 live so many times that he realised the @entity106 was a victim of the high defensive line employed by the @entity93 coach @entity108			2
@entity73 signed him for £ 8.5m in the summer of 2013 and he looked every inch a @entity111 player in his debut season on the south coast			2
@entity44 was rewarded with the @entity1 manager 's job after his exploits at @entity46 @entity53 was still basking in the glow of his @entity56 treble when he replaced @entity44 a year later he was sold to @entity119 for £ 20m and what has happened to his form since then is @entity123 ’ business , not @entity69 ’s			1
@entity73 ’s capture of @entity88 , and his subsequent performances at the heart of their defence , earned @entity69 respect throughout the club			0
his eye for a player is well known in the game and his enthusiasm for travel has distinguished him from many of his contemporaries at other clubs			0
this bodes well for @entity1			0
@entity0 has started a massive restructuring programme of his scouting and recruitment divisions after realising just how far behind they are in terms of modern methods			1
for too long they have relied on the @entity148 and @entity149 systems to alert them to player performance around the world			0
@entity0 , aware that north @entity81 rivals @entity153 have 12 full - time , paid scouts , has realised they need to get out there and start watching some games			1
he has joined a club that is widely - recognised as the most political in the @entity160 and there are too many people wanting to hang around the first team on matchday			0
part of @entity0 ’s masterplan is to bringing some structure to the club ’s recruitment policy after squandering the @entity171 money in a calamitous supermarket sweep before the transfer deadline in 2013			1
@entity69 , to his credit , is the answer			0
there are few more hard - working men operating behind the scenes and he will go to any game , anywhere			0
@entity69 's task is to overhaul @entity1 's scouting system and have the success he did at @entity73 current @entity1 manager @entity183 lobbied for @entity69 's appointment @entity183 has been lobbying @entity0 for his appointment , promising the @entity1 chairman that he can make the difference behind the scenes			1
it represents quite a change of heart by @entity1 ’s head coach because he has left @entity194 , his sporting director at his previous club @entity195 , high and dry since moving to @entity196			2
there was a time when @entity183 wanted @entity194 at @entity73 and had argued his case for his arrival with @entity85			0
he remained loyal to @entity69			0
there will be more upheaval at @entity1 in the coming weeks as @entity0 recruits some full - time scouts to work with @entity69			1
if it does n’t work out this time , then it will be time for the main man to come under pressure .			0

@entity7 looked like a good bet after winning @entity22 in 2008
however , @entity210 was sacked a few matches into the next season
@entity44 , @entity53 and @entity214 been and gone
@entity1 have hired @entity217 head of recruitment @entity69
@entity0 could be under pressure if things do *n't* start working out
