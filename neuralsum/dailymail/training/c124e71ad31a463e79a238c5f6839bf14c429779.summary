@entity1 leader @entity0 is facing a growing leadership crisis amid claims that @entity4 is plotting her downfall this week			1
at the party 's @entity9 conference in @entity11 there are strong rumours that miss @entity13 is ' ready ' to quit , although this was slapped down by her supporters			1
the party is bracing itself for more in - fighting and soul - searching following last week 's referendum , and the @entity19 @entity18 revealed yesterday that former @entity19 secretary mr @entity4 is already being lined up as the next leader			1
' it 's a bit rich that those who refused to stand for the job when the party was in its darkest hour now think they are the answer , ' said one insider			1
while the party fights among itself , @entity19 's future has become one of the main topics in @entity11 , with @entity9 leader @entity49 today set to use his keynote speech to warn : ' a country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health			1
' mr @entity49 yesterday praised @entity19 politicians who helped defeat the threat of independence , however he gaffed by failing to thank former prime minister @entity57			1
although @entity19 strongly backed the @entity60 in last week 's referendum , the @entity59 campaign triumphed in @entity1 's heartlands of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 – including in miss @entity13 's own seat of @entity67			1
that has triggered despair within the party , and one source said : ' nobody now expects @entity0 to lead the party into 2016			1
' however , miss @entity13 told delegates in @entity11 : ' i look forward to working with @entity49 in @entity76 , [ and ] to lead @entity1 to victory in 2016			0
' rumours have emerged that miss @entity13 is on the verge of quitting , something he supporters deny miss @entity13 was elected leader in the wake of the party 's 2011 election drubbing , beating msp @entity88 and mp @entity90			1
she has performed capably in @entity91 , often beating @entity92 at @entity94 's questions , and launched a controversial full - scale review of the party 's policies in a bid to end the country 's ' something for nothing culture '			2
she is also well liked by members who are grateful to her for taking on the challenge when the party was at its lowest ebb			2
however , she has struggled to create a public profile for herself and observers claim she now looks ' weary ' , with @entity1 still trailing far behind the @entity108 in the polls			0
rumours of her impending resignation came just a day after a @entity113 source told the @entity18 that @entity4 is set to be appointed @entity114 at @entity49 's next reshuffle , replacing @entity116			1
mr @entity4 , who represents @entity117 , was a close ally of mr @entity49 's brother @entity118 , and he is unlikely to get his dream job of foreign secretary if @entity49 becomes prime minister			1
party sources say mr @entity123 is therefore being lined up as @entity19 leader , standing for the top job while still an mp party sources say he is therefore being lined up as @entity19 leader , standing for the top job while still an mp – like @entity92 did with the @entity108 in 2004 – and then switching to the @entity129 at the 2016 election			1
yesterday , current shadow scottish secretary @entity116 admitted the party must face up to last week 's referendum results in its heartlands			2
' we have to be honest when we look at the results and see that some of the people who think that @entity9 ca n't work for them are @entity1 voters , ' she told delegates in @entity11			0
' they are terrified of @entity140 governments , they are worried about the future of our public services , and they are looking at their living standards which have been ground down year on year			0
' we need to understand why they are angry and what we need to do about it			0
we need to understand why , in areas like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity149 people feel so let down that they want to opt out entirely			0
' today , mr @entity49 will say : ' we will show the people of @entity19 over the coming years that they made the right choice , because we are better together			2
' but let 's face it : our country nearly broke up			0
a country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health			0
' he will tell a story about a cleaner called @entity161 he met in @entity19 , who was considering voting for independence			1
' i do n't know how she voted , but i do know the question she was asking : is anything going to make life better for me and my family ? ' he will say			0
' i hear @entity161 's question everywhere , not just in @entity19			2
can anyone build a better future for the working people of @entity9 ? ' ' it was n't just the referendum question			0
it is the general election question			0
' mr @entity49 yesterday praised @entity13 , mrs @entity116 , @entity180 chairman @entity179 and @entity182 @entity181 , @entity4 and @entity183			2
but he failed to mention @entity57 , who made a series of high - profile interventions for the no campaign and made one of the best speeches against independence last week			2
an aide last night insisted the @entity1 leader has already highly praised mr @entity57			0
' i wanted to add my thanks to all of our colleagues for the incredible job they did in keeping our country together , ' mr @entity49 said			0
' @entity0 , i want to thank you for the great job you have done and the leadership you have shown			1
' @entity179 i want to thank you because you could have had an easier life after 2010 and you did n't			0
you did n't because you care so much about our country and we will forever be indebted to you for that			0
