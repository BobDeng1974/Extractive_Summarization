' and i was desperate to make sure that this person was caught because i did not want that happening again to any of my boys			0
' @entity7 commented on the matter on @entity8 this morning			2
' he was my geography teacher , ' he said			0
' if he knows a balaclava 'd man has been hiding under the beds of kids in his boarding house , he then takes it to his boss , i totally understand ( that ) , ' he said			0
