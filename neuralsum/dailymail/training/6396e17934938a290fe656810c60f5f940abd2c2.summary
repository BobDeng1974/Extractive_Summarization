by @entity0 , @entity1 police may have missed a golden opportunity to save kidnapped @entity4 when they went to the small trailer where @entity6 was allegedly holding her captive , five months after she disappeared			1
@entity6 was ordered to hand over his vast arsenal of guns after he was arrested at the start of march and charged with simple assault , criminal trespass and loitering or prowling			1
incredibly the loner , who has been described as a ' gun nut ' by neighbors , actually called police and invited them to his home in @entity17 , @entity1 to seize his weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions			1
a @entity1 state police officer carries ammunition boxes from the home of @entity6 today in @entity17 , @entity1			1
@entity6 is charged with kidnapping @entity4 in october 2013 an officer carries ammunition boxes from the home of @entity6 on friday			1
it was revealed that police had visited @entity6 's home in march to retrieve guns - perhaps missing an opportunity to save the teenage girl that he is believed to have held captive official records show two officers went round to his property at 9.04pm on march 2013 , stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns			1
their visit raises serious questions as it is believed @entity41 , now 15 , was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her october disappearance			1
this has been backed up by the fact investigators have focused all their search efforts on @entity6 's trailer , a storage container in his backyard and a small stretch of river that runs at the back of his property			1
at this stage it is believed this is the only place he could have kept @entity4			0
yesterday the attorney general 's office refused to comment on the incident , but if @entity4 was being held just yards away , while officers were inside @entity6 's trailer , their visit will come under serious scrutiny			1
some friends and neighbors have already questioned why @entity6 , who has an extensive criminal record and used to work just a couple of miles from where @entity41 went missing , was n't already on the police radar			1
@entity6 , was known as , ' @entity70 ' around the trailer park and neighbors have described him as a ' creepy , gun - obsessed , odd - ball ' , who always talked about conspiracy theories and the zombie apocalypse			1
one resident , who refused to be named , said a female relative of his visited @entity78 this week to make a formal complaint against @entity6 after he apparently kept her held in his trailer against her will for more than an hour			1
' @entity70 ' : @entity6 , who had a long , criminal record was described by neighbors on his trailer park as a ' creepy , gun - obsessed , odd - ball ' the incident apparently happened back in february , but the woman , in her early twenties was too scared to report it			1
the relative told @entity91 : ' apparently he had her in there for about an hour and would n't let her leave			0
' i wish she 'd told us at the time , because maybe we could have done something about it			0
we felt it was important to tell the police now so they have every possible piece of information			0
' again the attorney - general 's office refused to comment on the complaint			2
@entity104 , who lives in the trailer opposite @entity6 , remembers march 's police visit			1

he said : ' he was a strange guy , but i just do n't see how it 's possible			0
someone would have seen or heard something			0
there was a girl in her 20 's who used to visit him on weekends and the police were in there			2
' @entity4 ( pictured center ) at the @entity124 office on thursday morning with her mother @entity125 and family friend @entity125 , who helped spearhead the @entity128 effort during @entity41 's nine - month absence however one former classmate @entity130 , is not at all surprised by @entity6 's arrest			1
he claims he was tormented by @entity132 throughout his school years and describes @entity132 as rotten to the core			0
they first met in sixth grade			0

i 'm really shocked no one could connect this to him sooner			0
' describing the moment he heard @entity6 had been arrested in connection with @entity4 's kidnapping , he said : ' i immediately called my mom ( @entity171 ) who was on vacation on the @entity173 and told her an arrest had been made in the @entity4 case			1
' i said , ' i 'll give you three guesses who did it			0
' the first words out of her mouth were @entity132			0
he tortured me and my mom for years			0
' another former classmate , @entity185 , says he remembers @entity6 as a loner who always got in trouble , but not a bully			2
he said : ' i do n't think he was a bully , but from very young , you could see he had the potential to go down the wrong path			0
i was in classes with him all the way from elementary school , right the way up to @entity195			0

he also said 1998 was ' the year of all the bomb threats ' , but he could n't say for sure whether @entity6 was involved			2
and in february of that year , @entity6 was arrested after he bought an @entity216 type weapon and ammunition from @entity218 , using a fake @entity219			2
@entity185 says he does n't know why @entity6 behaved the way he did , but always assumed it may have been down to problems at home			2
very little is known about the suspect 's family life			0
from arrest reports it can be seen he lived with his father @entity228 and his year book references a brother			0
