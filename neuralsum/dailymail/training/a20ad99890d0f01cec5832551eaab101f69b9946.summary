by @entity1 reporter published : 12:59 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 07:00 est , 16 november 2012 cannabis is a class b drug that has been linked in previous research to psychosis people carrying a specific gene may be more at risk of developing mental health problems from smoking cannabis , according to researchers a study from @entity12 found that cannabis smokers carrying the gene @entity14 had double the chance of developing a psychotic disorder and this increased up to seven-fold if they used the @entity20 drug daily			1
the scientists , led by dr @entity22 , said their research could be used to advise people who are particularly at risk of the psychological side - effects			1
previous research has shown a link between smoking cannabis and psychosis			2
there is also emerging data that cannabis exposure during adolescence may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia			1
the team studied 489 patients who had had their first episode of psychosis and 278 healthy controls			0
they looked at the @entity14 gene which is involved in dopamine signaling and known to be abnormal in psychosis			1
they performed genetic tests on all volunteers , and assessed their use of cannabis			0
dr @entity47 said : ' we found that cannabis users who carry a particular variant in the @entity14 gene had a two-fold increased probability of a psychotic disorder and this increased up to seven-fold if they used cannabis daily			1
' although using cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia , most cannabis users come to no harm			2
it has therefore been suggested that those who develop psychosis may carry some genetic vulnerability			0
' our findings help to explain why one cannabis user develops psychosis while his friends continue smoking without problems			0
such findings could also help to design health educational campaigns tailored to reach those young people at particular risk			2
' dr @entity75 , editor of @entity76 says : ' while the @entity14 genotype does not rise to the level of a clinically useful test of the risk for cannabis psychosis , it does show that this source of psychosis risk has a genetic underpinning			1
' this advance also points to cellular signaling mechanisms mediated by @entity14 as being relevant to the biology of cannabis psychosis			2
this may suggest research directions for novel therapeutics for cannabis psychosis			0
' the authors added that further research is needed before the findings can be clinically significant			0

cannabis smokers had double the risk of developing a psychotic disorder if they carried the gene @entity14
research could be used to advise people at *greater* risk of side - effects
