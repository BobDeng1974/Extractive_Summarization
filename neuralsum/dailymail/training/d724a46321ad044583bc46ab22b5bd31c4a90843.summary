with smartwatches rising in popularity , figuring out how best to input text onto them has become a bit of an issue			0
but @entity6 thinks they 've got part of an answer with their handwriting tool			1
called the @entity12 , it lets a user draw letters , numbers and even symbols in the middle of watch , which are then registered by the device			1
the @entity12 lets users write on the middle of the watch ( shown )			1
it can recognise letters , numbers and also some symbols the prototype reported by @entity33 is compatible both with square @entity27 watches and the circular @entity35 so far			1
most smartwatches currently employ some form of speech recognition to carry out most tasks			2
write lowercase - you can enter lowercase @entity43 letters ( print ) , numbers , and basic punctuation symbols			1
@entity48 letters are not supported			2
start slowly and neatly - when using the prototype for the first time , watch the fading strokes on the writing panel and make sure they are legible and properly separated from one another			1
the recognition accuracy should be fairly high that way			2
then try to develop a sense for how sloppy you can write while still getting good accuracy			0
frequent words like ' this ' , ' and ' , ' is ' and so on will often be auto - corrected by the system once all characters have been entered , so it 's generally faster to finish writing these words even if there are wrong letters along the way			2
rare words on the other hand , like names or hashtags , should be written slowly and verified character by character ( auto - correct is suppressed if you pause a little after each character )			0
the backspace key has a repeat function when you hold it down			0
but , as the @entity82 team points out , there are some situations where speaking to your watch is either not appropriate or possible			0
' with the @entity12 we are exploring handwriting recognition for text input on small touch screens , ' the team writes on their site			1
' handwriting , unlike speech , is discreet and not prone to background noise			0
' they also add that a handwriting method allows the whole screen to be used for each character , rather than classic typing methods where part of the screen must be obscured			0
this leaves room on the left for a large backspace button , and on the right for a space bar button			0
for now only lowercase @entity43 letters , numbers and basic punctuation symbols can be used			2
the team advises that you should write slowly and neatly at first in order for the recognition software to get to grips with your writing style			1
in addition words will be auto - corrected so , they note , it is often quicker to finish a word if an error is made rather than going back to fix something			0
while it is available for download now , the team notes that it should be for research purposes only as it is still in a very early stage			0

researchers at @entity6 's @entity23 base in @entity24 have developed a writing tool for @entity27 smart watches
the @entity12 lets users write on the middle of the watch
it can recognise letters , numbers and also some symbols
recognition software can also learn your handwriting style
while it is available for download , they note it is only a prototype for now
it is intended as an alternative to using voice recognition on devices
