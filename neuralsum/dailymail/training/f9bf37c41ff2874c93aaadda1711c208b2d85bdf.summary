among the qualities required in the heat of a relegation battle , a cool head and composure always come in handy			0
the @entity7 captain has spent much of his controversial career tackling his demons and trying to control his anger , not always with the greatest success			2
even by his questionable standards , however , the red card @entity5 received in the 32nd minute at the @entity14 was stupid in the extreme			2

they hit back to equalise through @entity83 but could n’t hold on and conceded a crucial late goal from @entity85 as fellow strugglers @entity22 celebrated what could prove to be a priceless victory in the fight for @entity30 survival			1
there was no need for @entity5 to get involved when @entity51 marred an otherwise impressive debut by lunging into a tackle on @entity42			1
as @entity22 ’s players complained and referee @entity71 reached for his yellow card to book the youngster , @entity5 positioned himself at the centre of the melee to try and defend his teammate			1
he pushed @entity33 and then responded to a shove in the back from @entity16 by swinging a low blow into his opponent ’s groin			2

@entity5 apologised to his team - mates and the club ’s fans on @entity117 afterwards , but the incident was reminiscent of his sending - off on the last day of the season at @entity120 in 2012 when he saw red and received a 12 - match ban for elbowing @entity122 , kneeing @entity123 and then trying to headbutt @entity124			2
@entity5 took to @entity117 shortly after the match to apologise to his @entity7 team - mates following his side 's defeat @entity7 were fighting for their lives that day as well			1
they survived despite @entity123 ’s late title winner , but the price of this defeat could be altogether more costly			0

‘ i did n’t see the incident but everyone tells me that what he did was just ridiculous			0
’ new @entity7 head coach @entity140 dismissed suggestions that he could now strip @entity5 of the captaincy			1
he said : ‘ @entity5 apologised to the boys straightaway ( at half - time )			1
i ’m sure he will be the first one to put his hand up and admit that he probably should have acted in a different manner			0
‘ it ’s always difficult when you have players who have that bit of edge			0
we ’ll have a chat when i see him next which will probably be sunday or monday			0
‘ i ’m more disappointed than anything for the hard work that seems to have gone down the drain			0
’ @entity22 went ahead in the 16th minute when @entity53 headed @entity16 ’s high freekick straight to @entity42 who executed a clinical right - foot volley into the bottom corner			1
despite @entity5 ’s dismissal , @entity7 equalised six minutes before the interval when @entity83 got in between @entity33 and @entity32 to meet @entity167 ’s cross with a glancing header			1
@entity83 , who missed out on a £ 4.5million move to @entity22 in 2013 after failing the medical due to concerns over his knee , celebrated by hobbling off the pitch			1
‘ i congratulated him afterwards , ’ said @entity22 boss @entity133			2
‘ our loss was certainly @entity7 ’s gain			2
’ but @entity43 , @entity33 ’s new £ 2.2m deadline day signing from @entity178 , settled it with his second goal in two games as he headed in from @entity41 ’s cross late on			0

he wrote : ' @entity54 kid making his debut has made a good tackle			0

my job as captain is to protect him			0
' i 've tried to prevent @entity22 's players influencing referee as u can see by me pushing [ @entity33 ] @entity33 away			2
' my actions towards @entity16 were certainly not malicious , it was a stupid reaction to being barged but i can appreciate it was n't right			0
