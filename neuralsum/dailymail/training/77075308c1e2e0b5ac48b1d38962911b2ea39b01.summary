by @entity0 what ’s the best way for single men to land a girlfriend ? according to one study the answer turns out to be a bit of a @entity8 - women prefer men who have had previous relationships , but having too many partners is detrimental			1
in fact , @entity14 researchers found that having too partners many was less desirable than someone who had none at all			1
researchers from @entity20 in @entity14 have found that women prefer men who have had one or two previous partners ( stock image shown )			1
men who had had no previous partners were less desirable , while men with five previous relationships were the least desirable of all the study was published in the journal @entity31 and is somewhat amusingly titled ‘ i want what she ’s having ’			1
men with narrower skulls are less likely to be regarded as dominant than those with wider ones , a study has found			2
psychologists from @entity41 asked volunteers to look at photographs of students with neutral expressions and rate the dominance of their personality			0
they also photographed the volunteers and asked them to fill out a questionnaire about their own levels of authority			0
the research revealed a strong link between the breadth of a man ’s face compared to its height , and how dominant he was considered by himself and others			0
the same could not be said of women			0
in it , @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity20 in @entity62 , @entity14 looked at how human mating compared to the rest of the animal kingdom			0
they noted how non-human animals prefer males that have had had previous association with other females , a phenomenon known as ' mate copying '			1
the researchers investigated ‘ whether humans also exhibit mate copying ’ , and if women preferred experienced men			1
in the study , 123 female university students rated men pictured alone or with one , two or five women represented by silhouettes			2
the silhouettes , or lack thereof , represented how many relationships they had had in the last four years			0
the act of ' mate copying ' , as this phenomenon is called , is something that has been observed in other animals before such as birds ( two red - crowned cranes pictured in a courtship display ) , as well as fish			2
the trait apparently helps the female of a species pick more high - quality mates the findings showed that women preferred men who had one or two previous partners , as opposed to those who ’d had none			1
men with five previous partners , however , were the least desirable			1
‘ maybe that 's an indication that he 's promiscuous or unable or unwilling to commit , maybe he 's a bit flaky - for whatever reason , he just ca n't hold down relationship so that was seen as a huge turn - off , ’ the researchers told @entity108			0
and age was also a factor - younger women were more likely to ‘ mate copy ’ than older women			2
‘ our results suggest that women do not always make mate choices independent of one another [ and ] there appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner , ’ the authors added			0
‘ humans are nothing more than a really pretentious species of animal , ’ @entity60 added .			0

@entity14 *scientists* say that women take part in ' mate copying '
their study showed that females preferred men who had *ex-girlfriends*
researchers found *optimum* number of previous partners was one or two
men with no old flames were less desirable especially with younger women
but males with five previous partners were found to be the least appealing
