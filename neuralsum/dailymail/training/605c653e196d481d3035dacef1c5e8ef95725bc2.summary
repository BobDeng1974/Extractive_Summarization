by @entity0 the smallest library in the world has appeared on the streets of @entity4 - and it has space for just one reader at a time			0
the bright yellow plastic structure houses 40 books and aims to help city - dwellers take a break from the pace of life in the metropolis by chilling out with a good story			2
the @entity15 was designed by a pair of innovative architects using recycled materials to protect the books inside from the elements			1
intriguing : a visitor peers in through the side of the world 's smallest library , located in @entity25 ducking in : the structure , made from an old water tank , has enough space to fit one reader collection : a reader browses through the 40 books held by the @entity15 in @entity32 it was constructed from a plastic water tank and a wooden frame , with holes in the exterior allowing visitors to look in before they enter the structure			1
@entity42 architects @entity40 and @entity43 said the library creates an ' inhabitable ' environment which immerses its users in the experience of browsing and reading books			0
the library in @entity25 's @entity32 neighbourhood has attracted a great deal of interest since it was installed last month			1
' the @entity15 idea was originated about three years ago and rapidly started spreading throughout the country and also popping up in some areas of @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , ' mr @entity40 said			2
' it remains a mystery how @entity4 was one of the very few cities in the country with no libraries			0
' bizarre : the library looks strikingly different from traditional buildings used to house books project : the structure is one of 5,000 @entity71 around the @entity72 and the world design : the architects have spoken of their desire to give @entity4 a chance to withdraw from the city the @entity25 library had its origins in a project set up by the @entity81 in association with @entity83 , and will remain in place until september			2
mr @entity40 added : ' we have a big interest to work recycling materials , but what we find much more interesting is to give materials , or objects , new functions			0
' for the @entity15 we wanted to find the perfect object to re-purpose , one that could not only shelter the books from the weather but also one that a person could inhabit - the water tank suited perfectly , the rest was just resolving how to hold it up			1
' with the library we wanted to create a place where to slow down , a pocket in @entity4 's streets where to have the moment to partially isolate from the surroundings and get immersed into another world - the world of the book you pick			0
' surprise : the funky - looking structure has prompted a great deal of attention from @entity4 tight squeeze : two people can just about fit in to the structure but can not move around inside neighbourhood : the library is located outside a school in the trendy @entity32 district of @entity25 there are currently more than 5,000 @entity120 across the @entity72 and internationally , but most are nothing more than outdoor bookshelves which can not accommodate readers inside			1
the project is intended to give everyone access to reading material even if they live in areas which are not served by public libraries .			0
