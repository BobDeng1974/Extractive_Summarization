by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 03:34 est , 7 january 2014 a driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine - month offending spree yet is still on the road , damning new figures reveal today			1
the motorist , from @entity9 , got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding between october 1 2012 and june 20 2013			1
his total exceeded the previous record of 42 points according to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) which obtained figures from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) following a @entity21 request			1
a driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine - month offending spree yet is still on the road ( stock picture ) drivers who get 12 points within three years can be disqualified			1
but the new figures show that nine drivers have clocked up 30 points or more			2
and more than 7,000 have 12 points or more			2
the new official @entity33 figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system , bringing it ‘ into disrepute ’			0
they say the ministers at the @entity43 and @entity44 must act to clamp down on the scandal which is leaving potentially dangerous drivers unpunished on the nation ’s roads			0
the @entity17 said poor communication between the government ’s @entity19 and the courts - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - and a tendency for courts to take ‘ hardship ’ stories into account means thousands of drivers are still on the road despite exceeding the 12 - point limit			1
the figures obtained by the @entity17 showed : the figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system failing to give the identity of the owner , speeding , and driving uninsured were the most common reasons for points , said the @entity17			1
normally a driver facing 12 points will be subject to an automatic six - month ban - unless they can prove it would cause exceptional hardship			1
a court decides if a driver is banned or has special reasons to be allowed to stay behind the wheel			0
the @entity19 said courts can exercise discretion and not disqualify in a small percentage of cases where a driver has accumulated 12 or more points			0
some drivers given points for failing to disclose the driver had argued that a series of different people had test - driven their the car ahead of a sale and they did n’t know who was at the wheel at the time of the offence , said the @entity17			1
the figures show nine drivers have clocked up 30 - plus points			0
and more than 7,000 have 12 points or more the issue of who was driving when an offence is committed is controversial and can escalate			2
@entity106 say the ‘ vast majority ’ of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving but notes : ‘ magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship , such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant			2
a fine will still be enforced			0
only a very small number of cases are affected by the data - sharing issue and we are working closely with @entity19 to improve this			0
’ a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity19 ’s role is to record the information provided by the courts			0
the courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver			0
