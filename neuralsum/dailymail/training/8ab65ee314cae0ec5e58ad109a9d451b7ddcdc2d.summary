by @entity0 no matter which stars or on show or which teams are competing , one thing will stay constant at this year ’s @entity6 - the ball			1
unveiled by adidas a few months ago , the so - called ‘ @entity13 ’ is the official ball of @entity10 2014 and it ’s the 12th ball adidas have made for the @entity6			1
and now the science inside the ball has been revealed to show how the best players in the world will have the best technology in the world on the pitch			0
the science behind adidas 's football for this @entity6 has been revealed			1
the ball is known as the ' @entity25 ' ( pictured ) and it is apparently a big improvement from the last @entity6			1
it has longer and deeper seams to make it less volatile in the air and that means it will travel further and more accurately during games @entity35 came under fire at the @entity37 in @entity38 as the ball used at that tournament , the @entity40 , was criticised for its unpredictability			1
the @entity13 ball has six polyurethane panels that are bonded to keep the ball the same weight and roundness in even the heaviest of rain			2
the never - before - seen panel shape revolutionizes the game by producing faster flight speed and maintaining true roundness			0
the bladder of the @entity13 ball is made of latex and provides the desired rebound			2
the ball is textured and feels more like the adidas ’ finale 13 , the official @entity57 ball , than the adidas @entity40 used in @entity38 four years ago			2
the @entity25 ball , in a bold white / night blue / multicolor colorway befitting @entity10 , is the most colorful ever for a @entity62			0
the sports giant claims the @entity13 , though , will have vastly improved touch and accuracy			1
‘ we do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths with deviations hardly recognisable , ’ @entity66 , @entity35 football director , told the @entity67			1
the ball itself weighs 437 grams ( 0.96 pounds ) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2 % , meaning it can retain its shape , size and weight even in the rain			0
it is created by six propeller - shaped polyurethane panels being themally bonded together			0
between the seams the @entity13 also has a different geometry to different balls , helping it remain more stable in the air			1
‘ the most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you have , ’ dr @entity92 , an aerodynamics expert at @entity95 ’s @entity94 in @entity96 , told the @entity67			0
smoother balls , as seen with the previous @entity40 , are more unpredictable due to a process known as ‘ knuckling ’			1
as air passes over the seams it can create a force that knocks or moves the ball			2
the @entity13 , with its multiple seams and roughness , will be less prone to the ‘ volatile swoops ’ of the @entity40			1
‘ the smoother you make the ball , the higher the speed at which it knuckles , ’ says dr @entity92			0
‘ in essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball , the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the typical kicking speed in @entity6 soccer			2
‘ by making the ball smoother , that critical speed went up and happened to coincide with the typical kicking speeds , about 50 to 55 miles ( 80 to 88 kilometres ) per hour , especially in free kick situations			0
’ this year ’s rougher ball brings us ‘ back to square one ’ says dr @entity92			0
the ball itself weighs 437 grams ( 0.96 pounds ) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2 % , meaning it can retain its shape , size and weight even in the rain			0
its circumference is 27.2 inches ( 69 centimetres ) and it has a rebound rate from the ground of 55.5 inches ( 141 cenitimetres ) the @entity13 is set to be one of the most aerodynamic balls used at a @entity6 in recent memory			1
its deep and long seams , seen here , ensure that it wo n't move unpredictably in the air another way the @entity13 has been improved over the @entity40 from four years ago is the depth of the seams			1
the @entity13 ’s are about 0.06 inches ( 1.56 millimetres ) , compared to just 0.02 inches ( 0.48 millimetres ) for the @entity40 , about three times shallower			1
the total length of the seams on the @entity13 are also longer , at 128.7 inches ( 327 centimetres ) compared to 79.92 inches ( 203 centimetres ) on the @entity40 all of this combines to make the ball rougher , and it also travels further – like dimples on a golf ball , the seams disrupt the flow of air			1
‘ this agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight , ’ dr @entity164 , a research fellow at the @entity165 at @entity166			0
‘ a perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces			0
‘ the seams of a football disturb the flow of the air			2
‘ this results in a smaller wake - area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force , which slows the ball down			0
the lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance			2
’ the result is that the ball should more closely resemble traditional 32 - panelled balls that most footballers are used to			0
despite this ball having just six panels , the deep and long seams will create one of the most advanced footballs yet used at a @entity6			2
‘ i am pretty sure the @entity13 is going to behave more like the traditional 32 - panel internally stitched ball , so the complaints we got in the last two @entity197 will be minimised , ’ says @entity92 .			0

@entity35 has unveiled how the @entity13 has been improved for the players
the @entity6 football is a big improvement from 2010 's effort
it has longer and deeper seams to make it less volatile in the air
this means it will travel further and more accurately during games
2010 's @entity40 was criticised for being too unpredictable by players
