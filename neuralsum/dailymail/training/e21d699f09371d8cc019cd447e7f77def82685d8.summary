by @entity0 for @entity1 an eight - year - old boy could have survived his fatal asthma attack if an ambulance call - handler had n't marked the case as ' less serious ' , a coroner has ruled			1
@entity7 died after paramedics were delayed because his grandmother 's 999 call was put in a low - priority category			1
if the ' correct response ' had been taken , the ambulance would have arrived before @entity7 collapsed and his chances of survival would probably have been ' enhanced ' , an inquest heard			1
tragic : the ambulance did not arrive for 23 minutes when @entity7 , eight , fell into a fatal asthma attack devastated : his mother @entity19 ( pictured ) heard he could have had a chance of survival if the 999 operator had correctly noted down the call			1
the call - handler marked the case as ' less serious ' @entity7 had been staying at his grandmother 's house when he collapsed , unable to breathe			1
but when his grandmother @entity29 phoned 999 , the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was			1
it meant the next waiting ambulance was sent to another emergency instead - and @entity7 was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the call			1
the young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff , but was pronounced dead on arrival			1
tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack			0
the tragedy - described as a ' subconscious and isolated mistake ' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question , but took the wrong answer , the inquest at @entity43 was told			2
the call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12 - hour shift - asked @entity7 's grandmother : ' is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths ? '			1
but when the operator heard @entity7 mutter something in the background , she wrongly registered the answer as ' no ' instead of ' yes '			2
it meant @entity7 's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13 - minute delay in the ambulance arriving			1
@entity64 , senior coroner for @entity65 , said : ' @entity7 died following an acute asthmatic attack			2
' the evidence at the inquest confirmed that the first of two emergency 999 calls was not processed in line with best practise			0
' full of energy ' : @entity7 was diagnosed with asthma at the age of five , he was described him as ' mischievous ' apology : the @entity78 apologised to @entity7 's mother , grandmother and two brothers for the delay ' had the correct response been generated , then the ambulance would have arrived before rather than after @entity7 collapsed , in which case , on the balance of probabilities , his chances of survival would have been enhanced			1
' @entity19 described her son , one of three brothers , as ' mischievous ' and ' full of energy ' , despite being diagnosed with asthma from the age of five			0
@entity93 , assistant service manager at the emergency centre of @entity95 ( @entity95 ) told the inquest the call handler had been using a series of scripted questions as part of a ' medical priority dispatch system ' that was used nationally and internationally			2
mrs @entity93 said all staff had been reminded of the importance of recording information accurately			0
she added : ' it was an individual error , i do n't believe there needs to be a change in procedure			0
' @entity19 is understood to be taking legal action against @entity95 through criminal negligence lawyers at @entity112			0
solicitor @entity113 said : ' @entity19 and her family would like to thank the coroner for his full and thorough investigation			0
' the evidence was unambiguous that had the initial 999 call been categorised correctly and attended @entity7 in a timely manner , @entity7 's chance of survival would have been enhanced			1
' @entity19 's loss is not something words can describe			0
' @entity7 was a happy and lively young boy who will be deeply missed by his family , especially his two brothers			2
' unambiguous ' : the coroner ruled @entity7 's chance of survival would certainly have been enhanced had he been reached sooner ' i will now be advising @entity19 in relation to pursuing legal action against the ambulance service			2
' @entity133 , director of operations for @entity95 , said : ' @entity134 would like to offer our apologies and express our sincere condolences to @entity7 's family			2
we fully appreciate that this must be a very difficult time for them			0
' the control manager informed the court that an error had been made in the control room at the time of the incident , which unfortunately resulted in a delay in despatching an ambulance to the address			0
' we therefore accept the coroner 's comments and since this tragic incident , have reviewed our processes within our control rooms			0
' the trust is committed to learning from all incidents in order to avoid any similar occurrences and to improve patient care and safety			0
' we would also like to thank the coroner for his handling of this sensitive case			0
