a team hunting for the legendary ' lost city ' of @entity2 in @entity3 has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old , according to @entity7			1
researchers believe the complex of plazas , mounds , a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace			1
it prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the @entity2 , which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and @entity24 explorers around the @entity26 area of jungle in @entity3 for hundreds of years			1
some people call it the @entity30 , after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador @entity36 to @entity38 in 1526			1
since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization , rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding @entity44 '			2
one such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the @entity48 , and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity , symbolized by a large statue			1
@entity52 , writing of his adventures in @entity56 magazine @entity55 , said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city			1
locals even told him that one ' monkey god ' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half - human , half - chimp children			1
the children were then hunted for revenge			0
local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist , according to a @entity3 media report			1
@entity52 said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the @entity79 , and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939 - 40			1
but @entity52 never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954			0
traveling into uncharted territory last month , a @entity7 team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey 's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old			1
the @entity7 's @entity108 wrote : ' the tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth			1
many more evidently lie below ground , with possible burials			0
' they include stone ceremonial seats ( called metates ) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes , zoomorphic figures , and vultures			0
' the most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what @entity123 speculated might be ' a were - jaguar , ' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed , spirit state			2
' alternatively , the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of @entity132 life in @entity133			0
' according to @entity52 , stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city 's central temple , which was built in the shape of the monkey @entity140			1
he described the myth : ' one day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an @entity146 village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens			0
' they took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children			0
' from this union came , however , not human nor partly human children but the small @entity156 or monkeys			0
' @entity158 ? @entity56 explorer @entity52 ( left ) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador @entity36 centuries before			1
speaking to locals , he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey @entity140 akin to @entity167 's @entity166 who is pictured ( right ) hiding @entity168 and @entity169 , two more @entity167 deities , in his heart to protect them			1
the @entity3 monkey @entity140 is more menacing , he said the lost city , believed to be full of gold , has merited two names based on legends			1
texts cite ' la @entity2 ' or ' the @entity48 ' it as the birthplace of the @entity180 and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones			1
other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey - shaped temple			1
there were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half - monkey , half - human babies , warranting the name : the @entity2			1
either way , it has been sought since conquistador @entity36 first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to @entity201 of @entity24			0
it inspired the @entity203 , during which locals roast monkeys over a fire in an apparent act of revenge for stealing their virgins			0
the first mention of the city came in @entity36 ' fifth letter to @entity214 in 1926 , when he wrote that it will ' exceed @entity215 in riches '			0
historians believe , based on his description , that the city was in the region of @entity26 - which was then , and remains now , impenetrably dangerous			2
' â€¦ i have trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces , ' he wrote , ' and of powerful chiefs ruling over them , and of one in particular , called @entity2 , and in another dialect @entity2 , about which i possessed information six years since , having all this time made inquiries about it , and ascertained that it lies eight or ten days ' march from that town of @entity235 , or rather between fifty and sixty leagues			2
' so wonderful are the reports about this particular province , that even allowing largely for exaggeration , it will exceed @entity215 in riches , and equal it in the largeness of its towns and villages , the density of its population , and the policy of its inhabitants			0
' centuries later , in 1939 , @entity52 rediscovered the site , and learned from locals that it was home to the myth of the monkey @entity140			1
writing in the @entity257 on september 22 , 1940 , apologized to his readers that he could not reveal the exact location other than the fact that it was shrouded by towering mountains , a ' rushing cataract , beautiful as a robe of shimmering jewels , cascading into the green valley of the ruins			0
' he added : ' more definite location than this i can not give , because , as i have written , many are they who have sought for the @entity272 , attracted by tales of treasure , and we want to find it unmolested on our return journey in january			0
' his words have been echoed decades later by the @entity280 , director of the @entity281 ( @entity281 ) , who warned the city and the surrounding rainforest could be obliterated in eight years if the government does not rush to protect it , @entity278 reported			2
the latest discovery comes after researchers from the @entity289 and the @entity290 ( @entity290 ) flew over the @entity291 in a small plane shooting billions of laser pulses at the ground to create a 3d digital map of the topology beneath the jungle canopy			0
compiling their data , the analysts revealed what appears to be man - made elevation changes that are thought to show a forgotten city plaza dotted with pyramids reclaimed by the jungle			2
according to legend , @entity2 or the ' @entity48 ' is full of gold and has been sought out by explorers and treasure hunters since conquistador @entity36 first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to @entity201 of @entity24			1
inspired by this legend , cinematographer and @entity2 enthusiast @entity314 sought backing from private investors to pay for the team at @entity317 to use their laser mapping technology to chart the forest floor of @entity26			2
over the course of a week , the @entity290 and @entity289 engineers flew over 60 square miles of forest in their dual - engine @entity324 planes			2
@entity327 's computer - generated images allow researchers to ' see ' through the forest canopy to the ground surface , revealing any evidence of ancient settlements or human - engineered landscapes			2
' the lidar point cloud data clearly show the remains of large settlements that can be characterized as ancient cities based on their spatial complexity , size and organization , ' said @entity342 professors @entity123 , who led the research			0
' we may never be able to tell whether any of these are @entity2 , or whether the legendary city ever existed , but we can clearly see in the @entity348 data evidence that there was a densely settled region with a human modified environment			0
' these conclusions provide important new insights into the @entity132 settlement of this largely unexplored region			0
' this was one of the first times that laser mapping , specifically light detection and ranging ( @entity327 ) had been used to locate ancient ruins			0
investigation : the @entity289 and @entity363 team produced this 3d digital topological map which when examined shows a man - made plaza ringed in red the researchers first flew over the area and captured the treeline ( top ) , and then were able to ' see through ' to the ground below ( bottom image ) the original uses of the technology were to provide intelligence after earthquakes , military spying and for river erosion detection			2
flying above the intended target area , @entity327 operates by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second			0
the @entity289 and the @entity290 team blanketed the @entity26 rainforest with as many as 25 - 50 laser pulses every square metre that totaled up as more than four billion shots during the entire project			1
@entity2 has played a central role in @entity390 mythology			0
texts cite it as the birthplace of the @entity180 and previous reported sightings over the years have described golden idols and elaborately carved white stones , leading to the lost city 's name			2
however , no confirmation of the existence of the city has ever been provided			0
if confirmed , the discovery of @entity2 would be comparable to the popularisation of forgotten sites such as @entity405 , which lay ruined for hundreds of years until reintroduced to western eyes in 1911 by @entity56 historian @entity407 .			1

@entity7 team ventured into @entity3 rainforest to look for the fabled ' @entity48 ' filled with gold
found white rubble which they believe to be remnants of temples built thousands of years ago
@entity56 explorer in the 1940s said people believed a monkey @entity140 raped women and had half - monkey babies
