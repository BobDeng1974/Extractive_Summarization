official records claim a staggering 6.5million ' super-centurions ' have reached the grand age of 112 in the @entity3 - but it is all down to missing death certificates			1
a record - keeping blip means @entity8 records appear to show @entity3 has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of @entity12			2
but in fact there are only 19 people who say they are over the age of 112 in the @entity3 today , and @entity8 admits there are only 13 still getting benefits			1
mistake : a record - keeping blip means @entity8 records appear to show @entity3 has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of @entity12 ( stock picture ) record - holder : just 19 women are over the age of 122 in @entity3 , with @entity25 , of @entity26 , pictured , the oldest among them at 116 years and 255 days old the error has been caused because @entity8 does not have death records for millions of people , the oldest of whom was born in 1869			1
that would mean , were that person still alive , they would be 146 years old - 24 years older than the oldest living person in history , @entity38 @entity37 , who was 122 when she died in 1997			0
they would also be considerably older than @entity3 's oldest living resident , @entity25 of @entity26 , who is 116 years and 255 days old			2
but far from being something to chuckle about , @entity41 senator @entity41 , who represents @entity42 , has raised it as a cause for concern			1
it means there are millions of @entity8 numbers which are still active , so a number could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds			2
problem : senator @entity41 , pictured , says the active numbers are an issue as they can be used illegally ' that is a real problem , ' said senator @entity41			1
' when you have a fake @entity8 number , that 's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things , claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits			0
' @entity41 is chairman of the @entity69 , which plans a hearing monday on problems with death records maintained by the @entity74			1
the agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records			2
however , it would be costly and time - consuming to update 6.5million files created at a time when the agency used paper records , said @entity83 , a senior adviser to the agency 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management			1
president @entity90 signed the @entity8 in 1935 , and the first old - age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940			0
' the records in this review are extremely old , decades - old , and unreliable , ' @entity83 said			0
the internal watchdog 's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these social security numbers - but it raises red flags that it could be happening			2
landmark : president @entity90 signs the @entity8 bill in @entity102 in 1935 for example , nearly 67,000 of the @entity8 numbers were used to report more than $ 3billion in wages , tips and self - employment income from 2006 to 2011 , according to the report			0
one social security number was used 613 different times , while 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each			0
illegal immigrants often use fake or stolen @entity8 numbers to get jobs and report wages , as do other people who do not want to be found by the government , and thieves are known to use stolen @entity8 numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds			0
the @entity122 estimated it paid out $ 5.8billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft			0
but the @entity74 is trying to combat the problem , generating a list of dead people known as the ' @entity127 ' , so employers can compare the numbers they are given with those which should no longer be in use			1
but none of the 6.5million people cited by the inspector general 's report was on the list .			0

millions of active numbers from people who would now be over 112
but there are only 19 women who are 112 or over in the @entity3 today
senator @entity41 fears the active records could be used fraudulently
@entity74 is currently working to deal with problem
but solving the issue is both costly and time consuming , adviser has said
