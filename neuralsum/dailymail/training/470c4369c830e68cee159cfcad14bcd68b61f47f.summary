built to woo the @entity1 , architecture experts are now calling it ‘ the @entity3 of its day			1
’ there is no doubt the views from the top of the 100ft tower , which boasts what were then the biggest glass windows in a secular building in @entity12 , are impressive enough to make you go weak at the knees			1
whether they also made queen elizabeth i swoon into the arms of her favourite @entity18 in the spectacular quarters he created for her exclusive use at @entity22 in @entity23 remains a mystery as intriguing as the rest of their relationship			2
@entity22 in @entity23 has been nicknamed the ' shard of its day ' with its 100ft tower and what would have been the biggest glass windows in @entity12 but @entity31 will tomorrow open the monarch ’s rooms in the tower to the public for the first time following a two - year project to install stairs and platforms allowing access to the chambers at the centre of the affair that set tongues wagging in @entity46 high society			1
yesterday the historic monuments body ’s head curator @entity47 said a door - its arch still visible - from the queen ’s outer chamber , where she would meet the great and the good , in the tower connected her rooms directly with @entity18 ’s living quarters next door , which like much of the rest of the castle were later destroyed during the @entity58			1
there was , believes dr @entity47 , an antechamber between the two sets of rooms where @entity18 , the handsome and flamboyant @entity63 , could well have ‘ lurked ’ until @entity1 was free of other company before popping in to see her alone			1
from there it is just a few short steps into the regal boudoir , where no one was normally allowed except the @entity1 and her ladies in waiting			2
‘ we do not know whether their relationship was ever physical , ’ said dr @entity47			0
‘ but they had known each since childhood , shared passions for riding and dancing , and it was no secret in @entity82 circles that he was a suitor for the queen ’s hand in marriage			0
indeed , @entity18 built the tower expressly to win her hand			2
’ the quarters within the fortress were built exclusively for the monarch by @entity18 , the @entity92 of @entity93 - and their relationship was a talking point at the time head curator at the castle , @entity47 , believes there was also an antechamber between the rooms where the @entity92 could have ‘ lurked ’ until her majesty was free a door arch is still visible from where her outer chamber would have been within the tower that connect her room directly with @entity18 ’s living quarters next door their relationship - portrayed by @entity109 and @entity110 in the 1998 film @entity1 - was much talked about after @entity18 ’s first wife @entity112 broke her neck and died after apparently falling down the stairs at @entity115 , @entity116 , in 1560			1
debate raged over whether @entity18 had got rid of her as an obstacle to his relationship with the monarch			2
@entity18 , who was also the master of the horse , overseeing all the queen ’s equestrian needs for travel and hunting , was granted @entity22 by @entity1 in 1563			2
at a cost equivalent to tens of millions of pounds in today ’s money , he began building the tower for her there in 1570			0
@entity1 stayed at the castle four times during her summer ‘ progresses ’ away from @entity134			1
her last visit in 1575 caused particularly intense speculation about their relationship as she stayed for 19 days from july 9 to 27 - the longest she ever stayed at any courtier ’s house			2
@entity1 ( posed by model ) stayed at the castle four times during her summer ‘ progresses ’ away from @entity134 and her last visit in 1575 caused particularly intense speculation about their relationship as she stayed for 19 days from july 9 to 27 - the longest she ever stayed at any courtier ’s house documentary evidence shows the tower was built right in the middle of the period when @entity18 was getting her to come visit and it was referred to as “ the @entity1 ’s lodge dr @entity47 said : ‘ we know from documentary evidence when the tower was built was right in the middle of the period when @entity18 was getting her to come there			1
people referred to it as ‘ the @entity1 ’s lodge ’			0
‘ she was 41 and he 42 during the 1575 visit and it has long been thought this was his last throw of the dice to get her to marry him			0
he even commissioned portraits of the queen and himself specifically for that visit , which might have been intended to hang in the dancing chamber above her bedroom			0
’ in a letter , @entity172 , a member of @entity18 ’s household , described the tower as ‘ in day - time on every side so glittering with glass , at night by continual brightness of candle , fire and torchlight , transparent through the lightsome windows , as it were the @entity185 @entity184 [ an ancient lighthouse ] relucent unto all the @entity188 coast			1
’ dr @entity47 said : ‘ it is the shard of its day , architecturally extremely daring in its use of large glass windows and what it looked like from the outside			1
but @entity18 ( right ) failed to win ( left ) @entity1 's hand - his chances having probably not been helped by him fathering an illegitimate son to @entity198 in 1574 a painting of @entity22 dated 1620			1
the @entity1 's rooms in the tower will be open to the public for the first time tomorrow after a two - year project to install stairs ‘ it would have formed an impressive backdrop to the deer hunts which the queen and @entity18 went on daily during her stay , with the sun glinting off the windows and the tower reflected in the lake which was then in the grounds			1
’ @entity18 failed , however , to win the queen ’s hand , his chances having probably not been helped by him fathering an illegitimate son by @entity220 in 1574			0
@entity1 never returned to @entity22 and he married @entity221 , @entity221 , in 1578			0
but the queen evidently retained an affection for him and kept a letter he wrote to her shortly before his death in 1588			0
its contents were mere pleasantries , but she wrote on the back ‘ his last letter ’ and kept it in a casket of treasured possessions by her bed until her death in 1603			0
the tower was previously only viewable looking up from its cellar level in what dr @entity47 calls ‘ a @entity240 ’s eye view of history - like looking up a chimney			0
’ now visitors can walk round the remains of all four storeys of the ruined tower and into what would have been its individual rooms			0
elizabethan fireplaces , the vast bay window frames and door arches are still visible , as are holes in the walls where ornate plaster friezes decorated with gold leaf would once have hung			0
tomorrow ’s opening coincides with the 481st anniversary of @entity1 ’s birth this sunday .			2

the rooms within the castle were built exclusively for the @entity1 by @entity18 , the @entity92 of @entity93
