fit or quit ? smartphone health apps have been accused of ‘ fuelling anxiety ’ they ’re designed to make it easier for you to get healthy			1
but in fact mobile health apps are ‘ fuelling anxiety ’ and ‘ eroding people ’s sense of wellbeing ’ , warns a senior gp			1
the ‘ untested and unscientific ’ apps cause stress by making us worry that we are abnormal or unhealthy , says dr @entity14			1
popular apps include @entity16 and @entity18 ’s health app , which is automatically installed on the latest @entity18 smartphones			2
but dr @entity14 warned that newer apps that monitor your heart rate , blood pressure and blood oxygen levels could be causing unnecessary worry without providing any benefit			2
‘ the truth is that these apps and devices are untested and unscientific , and they will open the door of uncertainty ’ , the @entity28 wrote in the @entity29			2
he added : ‘ we should be sceptical of embracing more medical technology			0
one of the problems we face as doctors is that although people are much healthier , there is a lot more anxiety			0
‘ people ’s sense of wellbeing has been eroded and a lot of that is by technology , use of the internet , that type of stuff			0
‘ my concern with the health apps is they have the potential to fuel anxiety without any benefit			1
’ dr @entity14 said that manufacturers were more concerned about making a profit than their customers ’ wellbeing , with apps purposely designed to make people worry about their health so they would spend more money on health technology , diet pills and slimming firms			1
‘ the people who write these apps will clearly have a commercial agenda			0
the underlying ethos of the app will be about profit and not about health ’ , he said			0
@entity18 ’s health app comes pre-downloaded on its new phones and automatically tells you how many steps you have walked each day			0
it can also work out the number of calories you have eaten and burned off , as well as your blood pressure , blood sugar levels and heart rate			0
warning : apps that monitor your heart rate , blood pressure and blood oxygen levels could be causing unnecessary worry , says senior gp and last month the computer giant launched the @entity95 , with prices starting from £ 300 , which can also monitor users ’ health and fitness			1
dr @entity14 said the majority of apps which just monitor your calorie intake or step count were ‘ harmless ’ , but are unlikely to offer many health benefits			1
and he warned there was a risk that patients relying on them would feel ‘ cheated ’ if they developed cancer or heart disease despite trying to follow a healthy lifestyle			0
however , dr @entity112 , editor of the @entity114 website , said there was no evidence health apps caused harm			2
also writing in the @entity29 , he said they had ‘ great potential ’ to reduce death risk by ‘ encouraging healthy behaviour ’ .			1

health apps such as @entity16 ‘ fuel anxiety ’ says senior gp
dr @entity14 calls the health apps ‘ untested and unscientific ’
*defenders* of apps say they are ‘ encouraging healthy behaviour ’
