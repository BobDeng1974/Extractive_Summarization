back home , when @entity2 did what we always knew @entity2 would do , 50 million englishmen would have given everything to wipe that smile off his face			1
sadly , the 11 on the pitch in the @entity9 did not have the same idea			2
you could even make a case that they had no idea			0
@entity16 ’s defence was dysfunctional and disorganised , brutally exposed at the very highest level of the game			1
@entity2 picked them off , scoring two magnificent goals on a magical night for his country			1
@entity16 were petrified by his sheer presence on the field after five weeks out through injury			1
yes he ’s world class and yes it ’s your job to stop him			0
allowing @entity2 to run through unchecked to score their winner five minutes from time is worthy of an @entity52 inquiry			2
what were they doing ? maybe we will never know			0
the @entity52 will be willing the country to forgive and forget , to learn from our mistakes so that we can all be one big happy family at the next tournament			0
no chance , not after this			0
@entity16 are as good as out of the @entity62 in @entity63 and that is unacceptable			1
every time @entity71 made a mistake in the first half , a @entity69 player was all over him			0
@entity74 , @entity2 , @entity75 ... take your pick			2
if your name is @entity79 or @entity80 then you ’ve earned the right to pull out the @entity83 turn on the halfway line when there is n’t a covering defender			0
you do n’t try that sort of stunt if you ’re @entity71			0
finish : @entity2 headed past @entity89 to give @entity34 the lead in the first half on the prowl : the @entity93 striker escaped the attention of @entity71 to give @entity34 the lead that terrifying moment was at the start of the first half and set the tone for some defending that , quite frankly , deserved to be punished			1
at times they were powerless to stop the little exchanges , the knitted passes between @entity74 , @entity2 and @entity101			2
that trio has the ability to pull any defence apart and @entity16 ’s threatened to oblige every time the outstanding midfielder @entity105 was on the ball			1
@entity65 had promised to work on @entity16 ’s defensive frailties after the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity41 in the opening group game in @entity44			1
in reality @entity16 ’s head coach had just one full day back at their @entity113 training base in @entity114 to work on specific details			2
it ’s no time at all			0
@entity117 : @entity65 did n't have enough time to correct the defensive faults from @entity16 's loss to @entity41 back with a bang : @entity2 , who missed @entity34 's opening game , celebrates his first goal in @entity9 lifeline : @entity125 tapped in @entity127 's cross to equalise for @entity16 they were scared witless of @entity2 , even after five weeks without a game because of the knee injury that ruled him out of @entity34 ’s 3 - 1 defeat against @entity132			1
he was short of match practice and high on energy , fuelled by the burning desire to score against a side with five of his @entity93 team - mates starting for @entity16			1
those who want to move on from the @entity140 and @entity141 era are well within their rights and will point to @entity16 ’s defensive record in the qualifiers			1
it was there , in ten games against @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , that they conceded just four goals			0
this is the elite level , a @entity62 in @entity63 and we wo n’t be back here again in our lifetime			2
this is a tournament where several hundred million people around the world are watching each game and dissecting every aspect of every game			0
this is the @entity62 , that ’s what happens , learn to live with it			2
there have been complaints that there has been too much attention , too many demands and too much expectation on the team			0
this is the elite level , where the best players in the world remind their countrymen watching on tv sets back in @entity179 , @entity180 or @entity181 just how good they are			0
heart breaker : @entity2 scored his second and the winner for @entity34 with five minutes to play delight : the @entity69 striker lets out a roar after scoring the decisive goal in @entity9 contrast : the @entity190 celebrate in front of a dejected @entity125 and @entity127 this is a @entity62 group game in @entity63 , boys , and the south @entity195 teams will fight to the death for the right to stay here until the bitter end			1
when @entity2 slips on that blue number nine shirt to play for his country after five weeks without a game , he grows as a man and scores glorious goal			1
just like the two he scored here			0
some of these games are won in the tunnel or when @entity34 ’s national anthem , @entity211 , @entity212 , is belted out before kick off			2
@entity16 had enough tub - thumpers in their team , with @entity89 running over to the @entity16 supporters behind the goal just before kick off , urging them to get behind their team			1
after this , they should be running for cover .			0

@entity2 scores both goals as @entity34 defeat @entity16 2 - 1 in @entity9
defeat leaves @entity16 's @entity62 hopes hanging in the *balance*
@entity16 's defence was dysfunctional , disorganised and petrified of @entity2
for the second game in a row , @entity16 's defensive frailties were exposed by a top - class striker
