created : 03:32 est , 14 july 2014 imams with links to extremist @entity3 groups are helping to turn @entity5 ’s prisons into ‘ state - funded breeding grounds for extremism ’ , an expert has warned			1
the @entity10 ’ association described the threat of inmates being radicalised as a ‘ real problem ’			1
there are 11,683 @entity3 prisoners in @entity5 ’s jails and the government has deployed imams to help steer them away from extremist paths			1
concern : the @entity10 ’ association described the threat of inmates being radicalised as a ' real problem ' however , the @entity9 has sounded an alarm about this process , saying that some extremist imams had ‘ slipped through the net ’ , the @entity28 reported			1
professor @entity29 , head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the @entity33 , told the paper : ‘ our prisons have turned into a state - funded breeding ground for extremism			1
it is completely unacceptable that imams with extremist views are allowed to preach in prisons			1
’ professor @entity29 , in an email to @entity46 , said : ' what these ' preachers ' do is put extreme views to prisoners - for example gays should be hanged , the @entity44 / @entity43 carried out 9/11 , adulteresses should be stoned to death			1
they foment resentments and when you add extremism to resentment you get radicalisation and ultimately terrorism			1
not every radical is a terrorist but every terrorist has been a radical			0
' the solution , professor @entity29 said , has many layers			0
he added : ' we should vet imams much more carefully than we have done in the past ; we should stop confusing ' preachers ' with ' chaplains ' , their religious qualifications should be properly checked , they should be required to preach in @entity71 and told they must keep clear of all political issues			2
' the @entity28 names three imams who are either working in @entity5 jails , or have done in the past , who warrant concern			1
@entity81 head @entity80 has said that an increasing number of prisoners are becoming ' convenience @entity3 ' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism @entity89 prison chaplain @entity88 is a senior member of the @entity91 organisation @entity90 , which has among its ranks a preacher called @entity94 , known for condoning the killing of women who have sex before marriage			1
another in the group , @entity99 believes that beating women will ‘ bring them to goodness ’			0
a red flag has also been raised against @entity105 , who has mentored prisoners in @entity107			2
he has shared material on his @entity110 page from @entity111 , an extremist group that advocates killing adulterers			2
@entity113 , meanwhile , worked for several years at @entity115 high security prison in @entity116			0
whilst mr @entity113 denies that he has ever held extreme views , he nevertheless was general secretary of the @entity118 at the same time			0
this political party allegedly supported anyone displaying homosexuality in public being put to death			0
earlier this year the @entity9 warned that rising numbers of prisoners are becoming ' convenience @entity3 ' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism			1
@entity129 general secretary @entity80 said that many prisoners were turning to @entity131 to win benefits , and to gain the status associated with being part of a gang			2
he said prison staff were coming under threat from groups of @entity3 on a daily basis , and warned that young prisoners were at risk of being radicalised while behind bars			2
in 1991 there were 1,957 @entity3 serving prison sentences in @entity71 and @entity145 , but numbers had risen to 11,683 by 2013			0
mr @entity80 said that many converts , who are known as ' convenience muslims ' , changed faiths because it meant they were entitled to more time outside of their cells and offered better food			0
@entity3 prisoners are also excluded from work and education on fridays so they can attend prayers			2
mr @entity80 said that others wanted the status and security of being part of a particular group while in prison , and that it was relatively common for prisoners to leave @entity131 upon their release			2
' some people also believe that it is better to have a cult status and belong to a particular gang ' what we 've got to guard against is the real threat of the extremists and the radicalisation of young , disaffected prisoners , ' mr @entity80 told @entity28			1
' they are the extremists of tomorrow			0
' however , @entity178 , chief executive of the @entity179 , robustly denied that extremist imams had infiltrated the prison system			1
he said : ' these accusations are inaccurate , unfounded and undermine the incredibly important work currently taking place to tackle extremism in prison			2
@entity187 have a critical role in challenging distorted and inappropriate views - to suggest otherwise is simply wrong			2
' @entity3 chaplains are subject to rigorous security vetting and checks , as are all prison staff			0
any member of staff giving cause for concern will be dealt with robustly			0
' the challenge staff face should not be underestimated but we have a dedicated unit and specific programmes focused on stopping radical extremists from achieving their aims			0
' professor @entity29 , head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the @entity33 , told @entity46 that @entity5 should be worried about its @entity3 prison population becoming radicalised through visiting imams			1
he said : ' since 2011 , 330 people have been convicted of terrorism and sent to prison in the @entity5 , currently more than 120 are in prison - not to mention others convicted of terrorism related offences but not terrorism itself			1
three - quarters of these are @entity5 citizens			1
' the director general of @entity222 said last year there were ' thousands ' of @entity91 terrorist in the @entity5			1
so far in 2014 we 've seen four major terrorist trials , one an attempted re-make of the 7/7 attacks , two plots to kill @entity5 soldiers , one plot to kill @entity233 members			1
we can expect two serious plots each year for the foreseeable future			0
' so it makes no sense to add to the list of recruits to the @entity91 cause			0
' and remember those in prison , even where they 're not in prison for terrorist offence but just ordinary crime , are people who have already broken the law			0
we know that those who have broken one law have demonstrated their contempt for our way of life and will be easy to convince that they should do it again			0
' some of the preachers visiting @entity3 in jail are ' fomenting resentments ' and ' putting extreme views ' to them , professor @entity29 explained			1
he said : ' what these ' preachers ' do is put extreme views to prisoners - to example gays should be hanged , the @entity44 / @entity43 carried out 9/11 , adulteresses should be stoned to death			1
they foment resentments and when you add extremism to resentment you get radicalisation and ultimately terrorism			1
not every radical is a terrorist but every terrorist has been a radical			0
' the solution , professor @entity29 believes , has many layers			0
he said : ' first , we should not be letting extremist preachers into the @entity5 in the first place			1
this has nothing to do with the @entity286 , i should add , but with those in government who give visas to extremists like @entity291 from @entity292			2
many @entity286 countries ban these people			0
' the @entity295 and @entity296 ' , which got almost £ 1m in donations last year arranges for extremists from all over the world to come to the @entity5 and traipse around prisons , mosques , campuses and even gyms			1
they should be dealt with			0
' so why are they let in ? ' this government finds it hard to stand up for strong security policies because it is divided on the issue , ' professor @entity29 said			2
' we 're told by the @entity310 like @entity311 and @entity312 that we are a free country that values free speech			0
but speaking freely in order to incite others to kill women who commit adultery , or extol the virtues of @entity320 is not about free speech , it 's about its opposite			0
civil liberties and lawful security are two sides of the same coin			0
' second , we should vet imams much more carefully than we have done in the past , we should stop confusing ' preachers ' with ' chaplains ' , their religious qualifications should be properly checked , they should be required to preach in @entity71 and told they must keep clear of all political issues			0
