by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 16:16 est , 22 january 2013 it is the brutal murder of two innocents which has outraged @entity4 - a country where thousands of women have been killed in the past decade , but where 90 per cent of cases are not investigated			1
two little girls - one six years old , one 11 - their tiny dead bodies still wearing pyjamas and clutching rosary beads - dumped in a @entity4 city street , apparently strangled			1
elsewhere in @entity14 , a southern district of @entity15 , two women also lay murdered , both shot , one reportedly in the face			2
today , as their bodies are laid to rest six days after they were found - they are revealed as family			2
emotional scenes filled a cemetery in @entity38 , 50 km ( 31 miles ) from @entity15 , as the coffins were carried aloft by crying women before being brought before a mass as family and locals paid their last respects			0
and although it is not yet known why the girls met their violent end , the pictures of today 's emotional funeral serve as a poignant reminder of @entity4 's so called ' war on women '			1
the deaths of the girls come as @entity4 experiences a surge in the number of murdered women			1
some 707 women were killed in @entity4 in 2012 , a significant increase from 431 in 2011 , according to the human rights group @entity62 , which tracks violence in that nation , @entity59 reports			1
at the time of their killing , the murders of 32 women had already been reported so far this year in just 15 days , while 216 men have been killed in the same period , the human rights group said			1
people carry the coffins with the bodies of the two women and two girls killed			2
although it is not yet known how the girls met their violent end or why , the pictures of today 's emotional funeral serve as a poignant reminder of @entity4 's so called ' war on women ' a child stands over a grave during the funeral of two women and two girls killed on wednesday , at a cemetery in @entity38 , 50 km ( 31 miles ) from @entity15 women place candles outside the @entity89 building as they demand justice for the deaths of the two girls according to @entity92 most cases are not effectively investigated and less than four per cent of all homicides in @entity4 result in perpetrators being convicted			1
@entity96 , @entity4 researcher at @entity92 , said : ' there is no let - up in the cases of killings of women and girls recorded every month , despite the national scandal this has become for @entity4			1
the little girls - one six years old , one 11 - were still wearing pyjamas and clutching rosary beads when dumped in a @entity4 city street , apparently strangled ' thousands of cases of killings of women and girls dating from the last decade are still unresolved or end up being archived due to inefficiencies			1
' @entity114 , director of @entity4 's @entity115 confirmed the children had died from asphyxiation			2
he said he suspects that organised crime is behind the killing of the two girls , specifically drug trafficking groups who do not care about age or gender , he said			0
in recent years , @entity4 has had one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world , according to the @entity128 : 40 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010			0
the country is believed to have struggled to cope with an increase of violence generated by drug gangs operating throughout @entity135 , such as the @entity136 from neighbouring @entity137			0
from 1960 to 1996 , @entity4 was engulfed in civil war between left - wing guerrillas and the government			0
rape was widely used as a weapon of war to intimidate opponents			0
more than 200,000 people were killed , most of them by the army			0
in 2008 , @entity4 passed a law aimed at violent crimes against women , but @entity92 has said the authorities are not making full use of powers			2
since 2008 a @entity153 ( @entity154 ) has been supporting @entity4 's justice system and trying to end a deeply - entrenched culture of impunity			0
but @entity92 says more needs to be done			0
@entity96 said : ' by failing to prevent violence , mount effective investigations and ensure those responsible face justice , authorities in @entity4 are sending the message that abusing and murdering women is allowed			1
' @entity92 calls on the authorities to fully investigate the latest killings of the two girls and two women , and to bring those responsible to justice .			0

the bodies of two girls were found dumped on a street in @entity4 , dressed in pyjamas
the children , one of whom was still clutching rosary beads , had been strangled
the *incident* shocks the nation , but violence has long been a *problem* and thousands of women have been murdered in the past decade
however human rights groups say the killers are unlikely to face punishment
