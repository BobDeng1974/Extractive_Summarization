by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 23 june 2013 a man who had his ten - stone testicles removed says he is looking for love after getting his life back			1
@entity5 , 48 , carried his swollen scrotum around for five years until four surgeons spent 13 hours removing the mass in april			1
he had to wear a hooded top on his legs instead of trousers to accommodate his testicles , could not work , and struggled to walk or drive			2
now , mr @entity20 , from @entity21 , says a romantic relationship could help him be happy again			1
' i can not express how ecstatic i ’m feeling about the future , ' he told the @entity25			0
' and if some way somehow or another i can stumble upon love – any kind of love – i think i will finally be happy			2
' i ’m very thankful that i ’ve been given my life back			0
' mr @entity20 could only sit down with a milk crate between his legs after his scrotum swelled up , and said he missed simple everyday activities , such as going to the supermarket and post office			1
he had accidentally squashed his testicles getting out of bed , but antibiotics failed to make them return to their normal size			2
doctors diagnosed him with scrotal lymphoedema , a severe build - up of fluid			2
the extremely rare condition is much more common in @entity46 and south - east @entity47 , where it is caused by parasites , than it is in the western world			0
mr @entity20 was so desperate to escape the ' freak show ' his life became that he considered auctioning his enormous testicle sac on @entity54 to raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for complicated surgery			2
the 48 - year - old bachelor from @entity21 had his surgery two months ago and was filmed for a @entity59 documentary he raised about $ 2,000 in donations after appearing on @entity62 television , but social security officials stepped in and stopped his benefits			1
the testicles were getting heavier by the day and mr @entity20 's health was deteriorating and he feared he could die on the operating table			1
then @entity69 consultant dr @entity68 offered to perform the procedure free of charge as long as @entity73 's medicaid system covered the cost of using a hospital theatre			0
he boasted that he had never lost a patient or testicle in similar operations			0
' there are a lot of shows about makeovers , but this is a real makeover , ' said dr @entity68 , the head of the @entity84 at the @entity85			0
' he 's basically a new man			2
' the operation , which saw 132.5lb of tissue cut away from mr @entity20 's groin , was filmed for @entity59 's @entity90 series and will be shown in @entity91 tomorrow night			1
mr @entity20 could not wear trousers , instead using the arms of a hooded top to cover his legs and zipping the body over his scrotum doctors rebuilt his genitals with skin grafts			1
but mr @entity20 was unhappy that he was left with an inch - long penis instead of returning to what he had before his illness			1
he told the @entity104 : ' i do feel a great sense of comfort that the weight is no longer between my legs			0
it got to the point that it was a danger to my health			0
' but when i look down at what ’s here now it ’s not the same as what it was			0
' my natural look prior to the growth is not what came out of surgery			0
what came out of surgery is a nub an inch long and it does n’t get any larger			0
' mr @entity20 will have another operation later this year , and said he hopes to be loved again one day when he has recovered from his ordeal .			1

@entity5 , 48 , had his swollen scrotum removed two months ago
he hopes to find love soon and says it could help him be happy again
