@entity1 's latest attempt to draw a line under accusations of racism and extremism suffered a fresh blow today as it emerged one of its candidates used his @entity10 page to ' like ' a series of @entity13 war criminals			1
the row threatened to overshadow a bizarre ethnic minority ‘ rally ’ hosted by @entity17 in @entity18 in a bid to show he does not lead a racist party			1
@entity22 and ethnic minority candidates and councillors were paraded at the ‘ myth - busting ’ event in an attempt to counter a string of damaging stories about racist and sexist comments made by some @entity1 candidates			1
anti-racism group @entity50 say the people he ‘ likes ’ include convicted war criminals @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
speaking ahead of last night 's event @entity17 conceded that too many ‘ idiots ’ had slipped through the party ’s vetting procedures and said he planned to ‘ fight back ’ against the impression they had made			1
last night ’s event was targeted by more than 100 anti-fascist demonstrators			2
amid chaotic scenes , more than a dozen were ejected from the hall by security guards after heckling @entity1 speakers			2
a noisy group of around 100 anti-fascism protesters gathered outside the building			0
the party paraded around 50 black and minority ethnic councillors and election candidates on the stage , who stood behind mr @entity17 as he spoke			1
@entity78 , the party ’s small and medium size business spokesman , told the rally : ‘ take a look at all the faces and skin colours represented on this stage and tell me @entity1 is a racist party			1
’ @entity1 ’s drive to feature more diverse supporters underlines concerns about the damage being done by exposure of the racist views of some of its supporters			2
until now , it has tended to claim it is being singled out for criticism and suggested it will not bow to political correctness			0
@entity103 , the star of @entity1 ’s latest political broadcast , was suspended last month for claiming @entity105 is ‘ not @entity106 ’ , @entity107 should ‘ kill themselves off ’ and @entity108 are ‘ bad people ’			2
other council candidates subject to disciplinary action by the party include a conspiracy theorist linking the @entity113 to allegations of paedophilia on the basis that he knew @entity117 , and another who suggested that @entity119 should emigrate to a ‘ black country ’			0
earlier this month mr @entity17 launched the party 's euro - elections billboard campaign , with a controversial picture of an escalator welcoming immigrants to @entity106 addressing last night ’s rally , mr @entity17 said : ‘ i do n’t care if you disagree with us , i do n’t care if you think we ’d be better off in government with @entity129 , @entity105 or @entity130 , i do n’t care if you think uncontrolled immigration is better for @entity106 , i do n’t care what you call us - right wing , left wing , small minded			1
but from this moment on please do not ever call us a racist party			0
we are not a racist party			0
’ he said that only those who share the party ’s views can become members and that its membership forms clearly state that extremists are not welcome			0
but he added : ‘ there will always be a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment			0
i would rather for the ten people out of 2,234 ‎ who have said things that are extremist or offensive that it had n’t happened			0
‘ these idiotic statements of a handful of people have been lifted up as representing the view of the party , but they never have and never will			0
’ the @entity44 candidate who ' liked ' @entity13 war leaders on his @entity10 page dismissed claims it had anything to do with his politics			1
it came after mr @entity40 was condemned by anti-fascist campaigners			2
he insisted his @entity13 ' likes ' merely showed an interest in military history			0
he said he also ‘ liked ’ historical figures such as @entity172 and @entity173			0
hope not hate writer @entity174 said : ' we all have heroes and we all take inspiration from a variety of people			0
so imagine my amazement when i discovered that a @entity44 @entity1 candidate listed a number of @entity13 war criminals as some of the people that inspired him			1
' but on his @entity10 page mr @entity40 defended himself , claiming that @entity50 were trying to imply that ' knowledge and interest in some of the @entity191 implies that in some way my politics is influenced by this ' .			1

@entity1 leader @entity17 demands end to racist accusations against party
but he admits some ' idiots ' have managed to slip through the net
