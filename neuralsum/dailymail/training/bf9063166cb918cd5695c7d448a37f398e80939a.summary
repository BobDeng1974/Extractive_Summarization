sick : the weather might make us miserable , but it could also be making us ill , according to scientists it 's not unusual for the inclement @entity5 weather to make us feel a little miserable , but it could also be making us ill , say scientists			1
more rain and bigger storms could be the cause of more stomach bugs in certain corners of @entity12 , according to new research			2
torrential rain leads drains to overflow , releasing germ and virus riddled water into our waterways			1
if this water is swallowed while engaging in watersports for example , it can make people sick			0
according to research , it is more likely to be viruses that cause us to be ill rather than the germs			1
the research was carried out as part of a project called @entity33 which aims to improve tools for tracking harmful viruses from human sewage in @entity12 waters			1
it has looked at viruses from five @entity12 sites including @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 and one site in @entity46			2
there are two types of virus which could act as a signal to more serious water - based diseases - one belongs to the winter vomiting bug family , the other to noroviruses			0
scientific knowledge on waterborne diseases has been a little sparse until now			2
@entity59 , a virologist from the @entity60 , told @entity61 : ' if we had better data , which @entity65 project @entity63 can gather , and we analyse the data using a health risk - based approach , we could get better estimated disease burdens from recreational water exposures			0
flooding : heavy rains and storms causes drains and rivers to overflow , spreading virus and infection riddled water which can make us ill research : @entity63 , a project shared by a group of universities across @entity12 and @entity46 is looking at the link between climate change and waterborne viruses however , he added that testing water for viruses is still difficult and costly			1
scientists believe that being able to monitor viruses in water could help them predict the effects of climate change and to develop new health protection measures to suit such change			1
it could also help predict a rise in the number of stomach illnesses by exploiting the link to rainfall			0
@entity63 is a shared project between universities in the @entity5 , @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity43 , @entity46 and @entity42			0
a case study of the projects findings will be put together after 18 months research .			0

torrential rain leads to drains overflowing which spreads **bacteria**
the **bacteria** , if *ingested* , makes us ill
