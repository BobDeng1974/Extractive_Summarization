goalkeeper @entity0 is determined not to let @entity2 's season end with a whimper			1
the @entity5 number one has made a rallying call to his team - mates in the hope of sparking a charge through the closing games of the year			1
@entity2 's campaign has fallen apart in 2015 with a run of three wins in 12 games costing them heavily in the @entity15 , @entity16 and in @entity17			1
@entity0 was in inspired form against @entity19 , pictured here saving from man - of - the - moment @entity21 the @entity2 and @entity5 no 1 moved to back his manager despite the team 's last - 16 exit @entity0 arrived back to @entity26 with the rest of the @entity2 squad on thursday afternoon @entity2 now seem unlikely to retain their title having fallen six points behind @entity31 , who have a game in hand , while they were ousted from the @entity35 by a far superior @entity19 side on wednesday			1
but @entity0 is not ready to concede defeat to @entity31 yet and insists @entity2 , who host @entity38 on saturday , still have a lot to play for			1
the 27 - year - old said : ' i will never give up , ever , and i could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either			2
we will see where that takes us			2
' @entity38 is a huge game and we turn our focus to that			2
we have no excuse not to throw everything at the @entity15 now and give our all - to the fans , the owner , to everyone			0
' every game is a must - win now			0
we have no time to lick our wounds , we have to fly into that game			0
' we have to win every game , and that is how we will go into it , and see where it takes us			0
' we have had a few knocks this season , but we have proved it time and time again , and so have our fans , that we come back and we keep fighting			2
' @entity2 's recent form has brought heavy criticism of the team and manager @entity70 , who could now be facing a fight to keep his job			1
but @entity0 , who was outstanding in wednesday 's 1 - 0 loss at the @entity75 , believes all the negativity coming the team 's way is only par for the course and is not overly concerned			1
@entity70 has been beaten four times by @entity19 since becoming @entity2 manager @entity82 scored the only goal of the game as @entity19 progressed at @entity2 's expense @entity86 had praise for @entity2 keeper @entity0 after watching him deny @entity19 a number of times he said : ' that 's part of being at @entity2			1
we all get talked about			0
i have been the worst keeper in the world recently and @entity94 ( @entity95 ) has been the worst defender in the world			0
' we have all had our moment			0
that 's the role of being at @entity2			1
if we do n't win we are going to get slaughtered			2
' it has also been suggested the squad needs a shake - up in the summer but @entity0 continues to back his current team - mates			1
he said : ' we have nine games left with his fantastically talented squad			0
we have a lot of tired legs but we have players to come in			0
they can freshen us up			0
i think we have what we need			0

@entity0 does n't want @entity2 to lose focus this season
