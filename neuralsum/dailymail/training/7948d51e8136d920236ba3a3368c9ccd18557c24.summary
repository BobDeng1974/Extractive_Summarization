by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 shrugged off a shoulder injury caused by a soft pillow to move into contention for a second @entity7 title in the @entity8 on friday			1
@entity1 , 35 , carded an eagle , five birdies and one bogey to return an impressive 66 at @entity12 and lie just one shot behind playing partner @entity14 , who added a 68 to his opening 67			1
' the bed this week is quite hard , which i usually like , but the pillow 's soft , which i 'm not so keen on , ' said @entity1 , who won the @entity19 in 2011			1
in contention : @entity1 's second round 66 moved him to within a shot of the lead at the @entity8 bad sleep : @entity1 shrugged off an injury to his shoulder caused by a ' soft pillow ' ' when i got out of bed this morning i did a few stretches and felt something tweak in my shoulder			1
' it felt a bit sore , then it got progressively worse and on the way in on the bus i was n't even sure whether or not i 'd actually be able to play today			2
' but i went to see the physio as soon as i got to the course and he managed to loosen it up for me			2
he did a great job on it , so i owe him a thanks			2
' @entity14 , whose previous wins came in the @entity43 in 2005 and 2008 , parred the first two holes but then birdied the next four in succession to move into a four - shot lead			1
the 40 - year - old from @entity48 , who failed to record a single top - 10 finish last season and had to regain his card for the third successive year at the qualifying school , dropped his first shot of the day after a clumsy chip on the eighth			1
and although he holed from 30 feet for birdie on the 12th , that proved to be his last one of the day as he missed from three feet on the next			0
' the greens were slightly softer at the start of the round , so that made life a little bit easier for us , ' @entity14 said			1
' i hit a lot of good shots early on and managed to make some putts , so that got my confidence up			0
personal best : @entity1 's only other @entity73 tour victory came at the 2011 @entity74 @entity76 dreams : @entity14 leads the field , despite failing to register a top 10 finish last year ' it 's a nice feeling when you get your distance control right with your wedges because it takes a lot of pressure off your putting			1
' but it got tougher and tougher the longer the round went on because the course got really firm and fast towards the end			1
so whilst it may look and feel easy , it never is			0
' i 've been doing some great work with my new coach , @entity93 , over the last few weeks , and my game is feeling a lot more solid as a result			0
' so while i did n't maybe expect to play this well here , it 's not a complete shock to me either			0
' @entity102 's @entity101 is two off the pace on seven under after a 68 , with @entity105 's @entity104 six under after also shooting 68 and defending champion @entity106 another stroke back following a flawless 67			0
' i 'm very happy with five under , ' the 28 - year - old @entity108 hopeful said			0
' i made some nice saves for par and that 's what you have to do around this course			0
local boy : @entity116 needs a win at his home tournament to qualify for the @entity119 ' you are going to be out of position sometimes and you have to play smart and try to save par. ' i am right back in there and that was the goal today , to try to make some ground on the leaders			0
we will see what happens and we have still 36 holes to go			0
' home favourite @entity116 , who needs to win to secure his place in the @entity119 next week - second place might also be good enough depending on results elsewhere - is six off the pace after a round of 70 marred by a three - putt bogey on the last			2
the best recovery of the day had come from @entity137 @entity136 , who played his first four holes in five over par but the remaining 14 in seven under to return a second round of 70 and finish one under par.			2

@entity1 moved to within one shot of the lead at the @entity8
