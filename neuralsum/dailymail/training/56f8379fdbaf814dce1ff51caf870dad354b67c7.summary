nothing says ‘ mood - killer ’ like having to ask a judge for permission to sleep with your partner , even if it is a soon - to - be - divorced partner			0
but that is just what couples will have to do if the @entity10 legislation is passed in @entity11			1
the bizarre bill proposes that couples that are going through a divorce and have children must seek a judge ’s permission before having sex in their marital home			1
no sex before divorce ! a proposed bill in the @entity11 wants spouses who are divorcing , and have children , to abstain from having sex or any sort of romantic date without permission from a judge not only that , couples on the brink of divorce wo n’t even be able to go on a dinner date with each other until their divorce is finalised			1
the bill bans any sort of romantic gestures between the two separating people that has not been pre-approved by the judge			2
in the current state law , there is a 120 day waiting period for an uncontested no - fault divorce			2
@entity47 senator @entity46 proposed the bill @entity48 in @entity11 on behalf of a loyal voter who had gone through a difficult divorce otherwise , the entire process should take less than six months			1
@entity11 also permits fault divorces , which have a residency requirement of 1 year			1
@entity47 senator @entity46 wants to amend @entity11 ’ current divorce law to the following : ‘ in divorce , separation , or 209a proceedings involving children and a marital home , the party remaining in the home shall not conduct a dating or sexual relationship within the home until a divorce is final and all financial and custody issues are resolved , unless the express permission is granted by the courts			1
’ the bill was first proposed in early 2013 , and it went through various hearings last week			0
on thursday march 20 , it received an extension for consideration in the @entity77 until june 30 , reports @entity73			0
in a bizarre twist , @entity46 himself has claimed that the bill is , ‘ going nowhere in the @entity81			2
’ he has hit back at criticism from the media , arguing that that he merely filed the bill at the request of a constituent , or loyal voter , who had gone through a difficult divorce			0
the senator even wrote on the bill , ‘ by request , ’ meaning he disagrees with it , but is filing it for a constituent			0
it ’s not clear precisely what benefit the bill would have , what the penalty is for pre-divorce sex between spouses , or how the bill proposes to check up on such affairs .			0

state sen. @entity46 has proposed legislation @entity48 in @entity11
if passed , divorcing couples *ca* *n't* have sex or share a romantic dinner
