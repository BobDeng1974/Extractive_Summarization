@entity11 's @entity10 was the scene of a highly - professional , high - stakes raid last @entity14 , @entity9 heard			1
thieves escaped with an 18th century jade bowl and a @entity18 porcelain figurine which dated from the @entity19 in a night - time break - in last april			1
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 both deny taking part in the raid , but admitted conspiracy to burgle @entity20 , 35 , and @entity21 , 32 , both from @entity25 , admitted conspiracy to burgle at a previous hearing on the basis that they were recruited to help unnamed figures who carried out the break - in			1
that basis of plea was rejected and judge @entity35 is hearing a trial of issue to determine what role they played			2
the two will be sentenced on friday , along with four others			0
@entity20 , tall and with a clean shaven head , told the judge he and @entity21 were recruited from the @entity43 to help figures in the @entity45 after chatting to associates at a garage in @entity25			1
he said they travelled to @entity49 , without knowing what they were to be asked to do , as they needed ' to earn some money '			0
there , they met some people in a silver mercedes at a car park , who asked them both to go into a building - the museum - and grab @entity4 artefacts , the older the better , @entity20 said			1
' they said : " get any @entity4 pieces for us you can " , ' he told the court			0
thieves tunneled into @entity49 's @entity10 before making straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a @entity18 porcelain figurine tunneling in : @entity4 treasures worth nearly £ 2 million were stolen from the @entity72 in the raid but security staff made him check in his rucksack so they had no opportunity to break into the cabinets and grab the items			1
@entity82 images played in court showed the men testing the locks on the cabinets in preparation for the raid later , the prosecution claimed			0
when the men left empty - handed , the gang in the car outside were angry , @entity20 said , and grew aggressive			1
so he offered to provide them with stolen cars , for a fee of £ 1,000 each , he claimed			0
that explained a series of journeys police have traced using number plate recognition cameras between @entity25 and @entity49 over the following days			0
@entity20 insisted he did not take part in the raid at the museum which took place in the evening of april 5 last year			1
@entity104 , prosecuting , said @entity20 was telling ' a pack of lies '			2
@entity20 declined to name any of the people at the garage in @entity25 or in the @entity45 , saying his life would be in danger			2
thieves escaped with an 18th century jade bowl during the night time raid in april a @entity18 porcelain figurine was stolen from the @entity10 in @entity49 after thieves smashed their way through a wall he claimed @entity119 had warned his family last year that they and he were at risk mr @entity104 told @entity122 : ' you are a man who has considerable experience of burgling			1
' he replied from the dock : ' a long time ago			0
i have never been involved in stuff like this before			0
' both stolen items were recovered later			2
they were from the @entity19 , the last imperial dynasty in @entity4 , which ruled from 1644 to 1911			0
the large green jade bowl , dating from 1769 , is from the collection of sir @entity136 , a @entity137 collector of jades and hardstones			2
