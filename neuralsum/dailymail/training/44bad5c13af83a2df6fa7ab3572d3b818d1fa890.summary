by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:49 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:49 est , 17 december 2013 mention binary numbers and images of modern computers and complex arithmetic are probably evoked			1
but a new study suggests this code was invented by natives of a remote @entity10 centuries before the concept of a computer even existed			0
researchers in @entity14 made the discovery after studying the language of the tiny @entity18 island of @entity19			1
binary arithmetic , which is at the haert of modern - day computers , is said to have been invented at the start of the eighteenth century by the @entity25 mathematician @entity24 they noticed that @entity27 had words for numerals one through to 10			1
but for numbers 20 to 80 they used a binary system , with separate one - word terms for 20 , 40 and 80			1
' those were probably the numbers that were most frequent in their trading and redistribution systems , ' study co-author @entity34 , a cognitive scientist at the @entity35 told @entity40			1
' for that specific range , it was helpful to have these binary steps that make mental arithmetic much easier — they did n't have a writing or notational system , so they had to do everything in their mind			2
' researchers in @entity14 made the discovery after studying the language of the tiny @entity18 island of @entity19 it is generally thought that it was invented at the start of the eighteenth century by the @entity25 mathematician @entity24			1
pure binary arithmetic works according to the ' base two ' system - ' 1 's and ' 0 's - rather than the conventional ' base 10 ' - 1,2,3,4,5 etc - system of counting which many cultures are thought to have used due to counting on ten fingers			2
@entity24 showed that the system could be used in a primitive calculating machine			0
for instance , they used the word takau ( denoted by @entity68 ) for 10 ; paua ( p ) for 20 ; tataua ( @entity70 ) is 40 ; and varu ( @entity71 ) for for 80			2
the system retains the arithmetical simplifications of true binary , in that it does n’t require the user to memorise lots of facts but instead follows a few simple rules , such as 2 × k = @entity78 pure binary arithmetic works according to the ' base two ' system - ' 1 's and ' 0 's - rather than the conventional ' base 10 ' - 1,2,3,4,5 etc - system of counting which many cultures are thought to have used due to counting on ten fingers			2
@entity34 and @entity83 at the @entity35 in @entity14 looked at the number systems in related @entity10 languages			0
they discovered the @entity88 system evolved to help people solve complex mental arithmetic			0
researchers believe the system helped keep track of this intricate trading network			1
up until the mid- 1400s , @entity27 traded across long distances for items such as turtles , octopuses and fruit			0
today a binary system forms the backbone of all modern computing systems			1
it is generally thought that it was invented at the start of the eighteenth century by the @entity25 mathematician @entity24			0
@entity24 showed that the system could be used in a primitive calculating machine			0
the ancient numbering system is thought to be the only known example of a binary code that predates @entity24 ’s invention			2
today the locals use the @entity113 digits and the decimal counting system used in large parts of the world			0
researchers noticed that @entity27 had words for numerals one through to 10			0
but for numbers 20 to 80 they used a binary system , with separate one - word terms for 20 , 40 and 80			1
pictured is a view of @entity19			0

discovery was made after studying language of the island of @entity19
*experts* found for numbers 20 to 80 @entity132 used a binary system
they believe the system helped keep track of an intricate trading network
today a binary system forms the backbone of all modern computing systems
