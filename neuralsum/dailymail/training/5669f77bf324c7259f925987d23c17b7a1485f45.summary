an ex-orthopedic surgeon and an architect claim to have discovered the holy grail of fashion footwear : high heels that are genuinely comfortable			1
dr @entity5 , a 47 - year - old single mother - of - three based in @entity6 , already built a $ 40 million business with her first namesake shoe collection , and has now launched a @entity10 campaign to fund her next chapter : ' wing shoes			1
' the collection of heels are the brainchild of architect and designer @entity16 , and have specially constructed carbon fiber ' wings ' built into the insoles , which support and cushion all three arches of the foot ; the medial , lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one			1
' this provides comfort and decreases swelling in your feet			0
' she adds : ' these wings make your feet feel stable , supported and secure , and gives them a " platform " to rest on so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel			0
' the pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle does n't wobble			0
' mr @entity16 came up with the first prototype , after which he approached dr @entity5 to come on board			1
formerly a @entity63 champion , mr @entity16 introduced strong but flexible materials to the shoes that are traditionally used to shape and streamline surfboards			2
pretty fly : the wings ( pictured ) support and cushion all three arches of the foot ; the medial , lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one secret weapon : the shoes are fitted with hidden platforms to rest on , so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel			2
pictured , the platform stiletto ( left ) and the classic stiletto ( right ) fancy feet : their design also means that the pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle does n't wobble			0
pictured , the laser - cut bootie ( left ) and the wedge ( right ) ' mr @entity16 brings a lot of different perspectives and industries to the shoe industry , which has n't really changed in 100 years , ' dr @entity5 points out			1
the collection includes flip - flips and sneakers as well as classic stilettos , platform stilettos , wedges , peep - toe sandals and booties ; all in a range of colors			2
prices start at $ 350 and run up to $ 1995 , but donors to the @entity10 campaign are rewarded with shoes from the line at up to a 50per cent discount			1
as the company builds its customer base , they aim to lower the prices where possible			0
the campaign , which is hoping to raise $ 100,000 by november 5 , will fund the manufacturing molds needed for the new wing technology			2
teamwork : mr @entity16 ( left ) came up with the first prototype , after which he approached dr @entity5 ( right ) to come on board with her industry knowledge engineered to fit : the wings ' flutter ' as you walk to provide a pumping action , which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet , thus decreasing swelling dr @entity5 explains : ' we felt that with @entity10 , it 's a way for us to build the community from day one			1
' this is a way for someone to be a part of our company from the very beginning whether it 's a $ 5 pledge or a $ 10,000 pledge			0
' she and mr @entity16 have chosen to donate a sizable portion of the net profits from their shoes to philanthropic causes concerning water , education and health ; something that might be unattractive to private investors , but she feels is crucial			2
so how did dr @entity5 make the transition from orthopedic surgeon , to a shoe business she started in her garage , to a multi-millionaire footwear designer ? ' as an orthopedic surgeon - and fashionista - i saw women who wanted to wear fashion shoes but suffered from how uncomfortable they can be ... especially high heels			1
' and of course , i dealt with several broken ankles from women falling off their heels , usually with the help of a few cocktails			0
' construction : dr @entity5 enlisted architect and engineer @entity16 to help design the collection , and the @entity10 campaign will fund the molds used to construct the shoes ( pictured ) dr @entity5 , who earned her @entity174 from the @entity175 , was the first to use a memory foam - type material called @entity177 on shoes she crafted for diabetic patients to absorb shock			1
she then had the idea to marry the passion she had for her male dominated field - only around ten per cent of foot surgeons were women at the time - and her love of fashion			0
she became the first designer to use @entity190 in a line of fashion shoes , a collection she designed in her garage 17 years ago with mr @entity16			1
' when i saw the prototype that he had made on my kitchen table it took me two seconds to realize , " this is the real deal ... the next big revolution in footwear "			0
' then and now : dr @entity5 had the idea to marry the passion she had for orthopedic surgery with and her love of fashion , and gave up her medical career in 1997 to start her first shoe label , which she sold off in 2008 women loved the shoes and dr @entity5 sold her first collection to @entity213			1
over the next ten years , she stopped practicing as a surgeon and built a $ 40 million revenue business instead			2
' once i had the time to look at what i had accomplished , i realized i 'd actually built a great company , ' she recalls			0
' it was hard to grasp			0
' one of the stunts dr @entity5 pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three - inch pumps			1
she sold her @entity5 line in 2008 and spent the next eight years planning her next move			2
mr @entity16 came back on board two years ago , and inspired by a butterfly , the new wing technology was born			2
we 're convinced ! one of the stunts dr @entity5 pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three - inch pumps ( pictured ) the surgeon - turned - designer , who is mom to @entity237 , 14 , @entity238 , 10 , and @entity239 , 9 , estimates she owns around 287 pairs of shoes currently			1
' it 's human nature to want to be desirable , and high heels do wonders for that , ' she says			0
' they make your legs appear more toned and elongated , your lower back more arched and your " booty " more prominent			0
' and for those of us who ca n't wait for her wing shoes to go to on sale , estimated to be june 2015 , dr @entity5 gave us her top tips for high heel shoe - shopping so as to to avoid ending up in pain			1
' @entity258 when your feet are most swollen , and look for shoes with some form of padding for your forefoot , since there 's a lot of pressure in that region , ' she advises			0
' look for shoes with a built - in platform to decrease the actual pitch of the shoe , and try not to go with shoes narrower than 1 cm of your own foot			0

the collection is priced between $ 350 and $ 1995
former orthopedic surgeon dr @entity5 created the shoes in *partnership* with architect @entity16
