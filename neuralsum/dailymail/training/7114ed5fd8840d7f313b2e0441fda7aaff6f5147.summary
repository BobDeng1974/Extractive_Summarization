unhappy : @entity0 , 45 , of @entity1 , south @entity2 , complained about the use of the word a chef who apologised after he mentioned the old ‘ golliwog ’ label on @entity9 ’s jam in front of a black colleague was still guilty of harassment , top appeal judges ruled today			1
@entity13 used the word when his back was turned to @entity0 in a discussion about food labelling in the kitchens of the @entity19 halls of residence , in @entity20 , where they both worked			1
after 45 - year - old miss @entity0 complained , an employment tribunal described mr @entity13 ’s use of the words ‘ golliwog ’ and ‘ golliwog jam ’ as ‘ unwanted ’ and ruled that what he said amounted to ‘ an isolated act of harassment ’			1
that was despite the fact that mr @entity13 had swiftly apologised to his co-worker after the incident in january 2009 and said he had not intended to violate miss @entity0 ’s dignity or to ‘ create an intimidating , hostile , degrading or offensive environment for her ’			2
three @entity38 judges today upheld the tribunal ’s harassment finding , even though mr @entity13 had spoken with his back turned , in a quiet voice and his comments were not aimed at @entity43 , of @entity1 , south @entity2			1
her legal team had argued that the use of the term was ‘ inherently racist , whatever the context ’			1
and @entity50 agreed that the word ‘ gollywog ’ was ‘ obviously racist and offensive ’ if used in the presence of a black person			0
the most important issue in the case , he said , was ‘ why did mr @entity13 say what he did ? was it because he knew he had used the word on the grounds of her race , but dressed it up as innocent chat ? or was it for some other reason ? ’ brand : @entity13 said a conversation turned to @entity9 's jam and the fact that its label had changed mr @entity13 had himself recognised that the term would be ‘ down right offensive ’ if aimed at a black person , and the judge said he had ‘ not been truthful ’ in repeatedly denying , including before the tribunal , that he had in fact uttered the word			1
@entity50 , sitting with @entity74 and @entity75 , upheld the tribunal ’s finding that the ‘ the most likely explanation was that mr @entity13 had used the word because of miss @entity0 ’s race ’			1
he added : ‘ his failure to be truthful about the fact that he had used the term at all , coupled with his own subjective view that any use of the term in the presence of a black person would be offensive , formed an adequate evidential basis for the tribunal ’s finding that the words had been used by him on the grounds of race			2
’ however , miss @entity0 was told that she had lodged her complaint too late and that it would not be ‘ just and equitable ’ to allow her to continue with her compensation claim against the @entity19			2
the effect mr @entity13 ’s comments had on her , whilst upsetting , was ‘ evidently short - lived ’			0
he had quickly apologised and matters seemed to have settled down in the kitchen before miss @entity0 lodged a formal grievance five months later			0
scene : mr @entity13 used the word when his back was turned to miss @entity0 during a discussion about food labelling in the kitchens of the @entity19 halls of residence ( pictured ) , in @entity20 , where they both worked mr @entity13 ’s account was that he and miss @entity0 had their backs turned to each other as they innocently discussed food and packaging			1
after chatting about @entity116 , he said the conversation turned to @entity9 ’s jam and the fact that its label had changed			0
' white people do n’t get called golliwogs			0
the word is an overtly racial comment			0
‘ @entity125 can not be interpreted in any other way ' @entity127 , for miss @entity0 @entity127 , for miss @entity0 , had earlier told the court : ‘ white people do n’t get called golliwogs			0
the word is an overtly racial comment			0
‘ @entity125 can not be interpreted in any other way			0
what the authorities make clear is that , when something is inherently discriminatory and clearly has racial overtones , there is no further debate			0
’ however , the @entity19 ’s barrister , @entity141 , insisted that mr @entity13 ’s use of the word - spoken quietly and quickly - did not come anywhere close to racial harassment			1
‘ i say it is unsatisfactory that somebody should be labelled with a finding of harassment on racial grounds when the actual context in which the word was used was innocent and inoffensive , ’ he told the court			2
the @entity38 judges dismissed miss @entity0 ’s challenge to the dismissal of her case on grounds of delay			1
her other claims of race discrimination had earlier been rejected by the tribunal , although she still has a victimisation claim against the @entity19 extant .			2
