by @entity0 last updated at 1:31 pm on 31st october 2011 only a third of @entity3 homes currently have a carbon monoxide alarm , while just one in five people realise the gas can kill , according to a new study			1
campaigners are trying to cut the annual toll of deaths and injuries caused by carbon monoxide poisoning , which saw 4,000 @entity3 treated in hospital last year alone			1
experts warned that carbon monoxide poisoning , which killed at least 50 in the @entity3 last year , is often unrecognised because its early symptoms can be easily mistaken for tiredness , flu or food poisoning			1
faulty boilers are one of the most common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning @entity24 of @entity25 - be alarmed ! said : ' we are urging people to go out and buy an alarm now - but there are also two simple steps we 'd like the government to take			1
' firstly , building regulations should be amended so that new homes come with alarms already installed			0
secondly , providing an alarm should be part of a landlord 's annual gas safety inspection			2
' inhaling carbon monoxide reduces the blood 's ability to carry oxygen , leaving the body 's organs and cells starved of oxygen			1
it can lead to severe confusion , coma and death			0
early symptoms such as nausea , stomach cramps and dizziness are often mistaken for flu or food poisoning			2
however , carbon monoxide does not cause a high temperature			1
the gas has no colour , taste or smell the only effective way to detect it is with an audible alarm			2
carbon monoxide is produced when fuels such as gas , oil , charcoal , coal and wood do not burn fully			1
the most common cause of this is when appliances such as a boiler or cooker is installed incorrectly or is poorly maintained			0
carbon monoxide can also build up when flues , chimneys or vents are blocked			1
alarms are available from many diy stores , supermarkets , high street shops or directly from energy suppliers			0
they can cost as little as £ 15 and many retailers will be offering special discounts in support of the campaign			0
@entity90 carried out last month found that 63 % of @entity3 homes do not have a carbon monoxide alarm and 78 % of people do not know that the gas can kill			1
the poll of 2,001 adults was conducted by @entity97 , on september 26 and 27			0
@entity98 , an @entity100 advisor from @entity101 in @entity102 , said a carbon monoxide leak in her home put her whole family in grave danger , earlier this year ... we could have died : @entity98 with her husband and two sons			1
they already had their boiler checked each year but did n't have a carbon monoxide alarm mrs @entity98 , 30 , said : ' it was the school easter holidays and we had just returned from a week away in @entity116 on @entity117 when my husband and our two boys - @entity121 ( 4 ) and @entity122 ( 2 ) first started to feel unwell			1
' it had been a really hectic week and we had done a lot of travelling so when we all started to feel tired , at first we simply put it down to normal fatigue			0
but then the tiredness became much more severe - at one stage i could hardly keep my head up i was so drowsy , and my four year old son who is usually full of beans was sleeping all the time			2
' my husband , who is really fit and active , was napping in the day , something i had never known him to do			0
i would never describe us as a ‘ couch potato family ’ , so when things had n’t changed after four days , we realised that something was up			0
' it was my husband who first thought about the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning , and on a hunch he bought an alarm			1
when we turned it on , the alarm went off immediately and kept going off			0
' despite this , we still did n’t quite believe it as we had no problems with our heating or water			0
my husband decided to buy another alarm – one that showed carbon monoxide levels so we could be absolutely sure			1
' when this showed really high levels , we immediately called the gas board and a plumber			2
the gas man turned off the gas and when the plumber arrived he tested the levels of carbon monoxide in our home			1
normal levels are around 10 - our levels were above 200			0
life savers : campaigners have urged more homeowners to install carbon monoxide alarms after it was revealed one in five do n't realise it can kill ' it was a fault with our boiler than had caused the carbon monoxide leak			1
we did all the right things and got our boiler checked every year , so it just goes to show you can never be sure you are safe unless you have an alarm			2
' after we realised what the problem was we evacuated our home and stayed at my mother in laws			0
after a week , we returned home			0
we now have two carbon monoxide alarms , which we test almost every day			1
' i feel so lucky that we are all alive			2
it was unusual for all four of us to be home together for that amount of time – if it was n’t the school holidays it is likely we would n’t have realised what the problem was in time			0
' the doctor told us there was high change we could have all died in our sleep			0
there is not a day that goes by that i do n’t think about what could have happened			0
' the fact that the highest levels of carbon monoxide were found in my oldest son ’s bedroom still sends shivers down my spine			1
the thought that i was so close to losing a child will haunt me forever			0
