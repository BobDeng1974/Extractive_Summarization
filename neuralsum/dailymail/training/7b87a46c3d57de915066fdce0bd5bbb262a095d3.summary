by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:27 est , 21 november 2013 a ‘ @entity5 gene ’ which causes people to develop freckles , brown hair and blue eyes has been discovered by scientists			1
a study of 2,230 people in @entity12 identified a gene variant that is strongly related to sensitivity to the sun , brown hair , blue eyes , and freckles			1
normally , the further from the equator people come from , the less pigmentation they have in their skin , hair and eyes			0
a ' @entity5 gene ' which causes people to develop freckles , brown hair and blue eyes has been discovered by scientists this makes them more sensitive to the sun , but means they can more easily absorb sunlight to generate vitamin @entity35 , a nutrient important for healthy bones			2
the study looked at a particular variant in the gene @entity40 which is part of the immune system and produces a protein that helps to fight off viruses and harmful bacteria			1
@entity40 appears to act like a ' dimmer switch ' regulating the amount of melanin in surface skin cells , called keratinocytes , which protect us from the uv light which causes sunburn			1
they discovered a variant of @entity40 can reduce the amount of melanin getting to the keratinocytes resulting in freckles , but they still have n't found the exact cause , according to the study published in the journal @entity61			1
dr @entity62 , scientific director of the @entity63 , in @entity64 near @entity65 , said : ‘ genes involved in skin pigmentation also have important roles in human health and disease			0
‘ this study explains a complex molecular pathway that may also contribute insights into skin diseases , such as melanoma , which is caused by the interaction of genetic susceptibility with environmental factors			0
’ the gene makes people sensitive to the sun. mr @entity5 is pictured looking as though he has been in the sun the findings could provide insights into skin diseases , such as melanoma			0
@entity85 ( pictured ) could also have the gene variant dr @entity87 , co-author and senior investigator at the @entity89 said : ‘ genome - wide association studies are uncovering many genomic variants that are associated with human traits and most of them are found in non-protein - coding regions of the genome			2
‘ exploring the biological pathways and molecular mechanisms that involve variants in these under - explored portions of the genome is a challenging part of our work			0
‘ this is one of a few cases where scientists have been able to associate a variant in a non-coding genomic region with a functional mechanism			0

study looked at variant in gene @entity40 which is part of the immune system
@entity40 acts like a ' dimmer switch ' , regulating the amount of melanin in surface skin cells - melanin protects us from uv light and sunburn
a variant of @entity40 can reduce the amount of melanin getting to the skin cells resulting in freckles - but it is not known exactly why this causes freckles
