by @entity0 published : 01:25 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 9 august 2012 now that @entity3 has finally joined the fun , the @entity2 men 's basketball team appears complete			1
there are some major defensive flaws but that hardly matters to this suped - up , scoring machine that goes from zero to 100 points in seconds			2
overpowering and dominant in a way not seen since the 1992 @entity13 , the @entity2 are now two wins from a second straight olympic gold medal			1
dominated : @entity16 of @entity17 moves the ball against @entity19 of @entity2 @entity20 awaits			1
@entity21 said : ' we 're ready			2
' pushed by teammate @entity23 to ' turn it on ' , @entity3 scored 20 points - all in the second half - and the @entity2 team stomped its way into the semifinals with a 119 - 86 win on wednesday night over @entity17 , which scrapped as hard as it could until the world 's best team put the game away			1
@entity3 made six 3 - pointers , @entity34 racked up a triple - double with 11 points , 14 rebounds and 12 assists and the @entity2 moved a step closer to gold on the 20th anniversary of the ' 92 team 's historic rampage in @entity44			1
with @entity46 commissioner @entity45 and two - time olympian @entity47 watching from the stands , the @entity2 set up a rematch in the semifinals with @entity20 - a team they buried by 29 in the preliminary round			1
unless the @entity20 , with their roster of thirty - somethings , can find a way to slow down the @entity2 , another lopsided loss seems inevitable			1
' we have maybe a five - percent chance of winning , ' forward @entity58 said after @entity20 beat @entity61 82 - 77 to set up a third straight meeting with the @entity2 in the semifinals			1
' but we are going to fight for that			2
' @entity3 had been more spectator than spectacular since coming to @entity65			2
he entered the quarterfinals averaging just 9.4 points per game , touching off questions about whether he was hurt , disinterested or perhaps unable to produce the same way @entity21 , @entity23 and @entity34 have been			0
nobody 's wondering any longer			0
at halftime , @entity21 and @entity23 both pushed the man nicknamed the @entity3 to do more , and @entity3 struck back with a barrage of 3 - pointers that sent the @entity2 bench into a towel - waving frenzy			1
' he was a little sleepy out there , ' @entity21 said			0
' i guess i woke up the @entity3 and he responded			0
' @entity19 added 18 points , @entity81 and @entity23 14 for the @entity2 , who pounded @entity20 126 - 97 on monday night in their preliminary - round finale			1
tempers flared in that one when @entity20 guard @entity84 intentionally punched @entity21 in the groin			0
@entity84 said he retaliated for being punched earlier by @entity2 guard @entity86 , who never denied that he took a swipe at @entity84			1
@entity21 does n't expect the @entity20 to play nice again			0
' you just have to go out there and take them punches - not literally , ' he said			2
' we 're excited about it			0
just now in the huddle we said we got ta prepare for them			0
' winning side : @entity34 runs with the ball in the game which took the @entity2 to the @entity99 semi-finals down by 14 at halftime , @entity17 was determined to make it a game and scored the first 11 points of the second half , cutting the @entity2 ' lead to three			1
the @entity2 was only ahead by six before @entity3 , who had struggled with his shot and foul trouble in previous games , finally broke out			1
he made a 3 - pointer , batted away a pass and chased it down along the left sideline			2
feeling a rhythm that had been missing , @entity3 pulled up and dropped another 3 that made it 70 - 58			2
two shots in 18 seconds was all it took - @entity3 was back			2
' somebody made him mad			0
i could see it in his eyes , ' @entity23 said			0
' i wanted him to kind of turn it on and that 's what he did			0
that was the first time we 've seen it here			0
he got so upset and when he does that he 's in another world			0
it was just a matter of time			0
' @entity3 laughed when told there were doubters back home			0
the @entity17 knew he was dead serious			1
' @entity3 got a little bit sniff , ' @entity16 said			0
' and for great teams , that 's all they need and they stretch it out			0
' @entity16 scored 26 points and @entity139 had 19 for @entity17 , which had the misfortune of running into the @entity2 in the quarterfinals for the second straight @entity99			1
by the time @entity3 got done , even the @entity17 fans were cheering for him as he walked to the locker room , bumping fists with a @entity17 ' kangaroo mascot wearing boxing gloves			1
this was another knockout , albeit one in the late rounds , for the @entity2			2
all that 's between the @entity2 and a gold medal now is @entity20 , a dangerous team with swagger and experience , and a matchup with the @entity158 - @entity157 semifinal winner			1
the @entity2 have tangled with the @entity157 before , beating them in the gold - medal game four years ago			1
a matchup with @entity158 would rekindle @entity162 memories and the 1972 final in @entity164 , when the @entity2 had its 63 - game winning streak stopped amid a controversial ending still debated today			1
the @entity2 has shown moments of vulnerability in this tourney			2
not many , but a few			0
it came in as the team to beat , and through six games , that has n't changed			0
' we do n't have no weaknesses , ' @entity21 said			0

@entity2 heads to semi-finals after beating @entity17 119 - 86
