by @entity0 a monster female @entity2 who is so notorious she has been nicknamed @entity3 has forced the closure of a popular beach			1
the beast - the largest ever tagged in @entity7 - is more than 16ft long , weighs around 1.6 tonnes and is believed to have made more than a dozen appearances in the last month			1
a photo taken by scientists reveals the moment they won a two - hour struggle to roll @entity14 onto her back and insert a sophisticated electronic tagging device into her gut			1
she is more than 16ft long only some of the enormous animal was visible as a looming figure underneath the boat - and one of her giant fins was almost as large as the scientist tagging her			1
@entity33 from the @entity34 told @entity35 : ' the shark [ was ] upside down , which induces a state called tonic immobility			2
in a sense , the shark basically goes to sleep			2
' once she was rolled back over , he said , ' the shark came almost instantaneously back to life so she was quickly released , and she swam off very strongly			0
' the shark believed to be @entity14 was then registered multiple times off the coast of @entity23 , @entity7 , including nine times on saturday alone			1
@entity48 beach had to be closed after the string of sightings , which were believed to have been prompted by a dying whale calf which had washed up on the sand			1
scientists said the whale calf 's distress signals and later , smells and blood , would have attracted @entity14 - who has been tagged once before - to the scene			1
sighting : the shark has made several appearances at @entity60 on the coast of @entity7 @entity62 , a popular part of @entity48 beach , had to be closed after the string of sightings , which were believed to have been prompted by a dying whale calf which had washed up on the sand since then @entity14 has been spotted again as recently as today , when she triggered receivers at @entity23 's @entity60 just before 6am			1
a @entity70 spokesman said on saturday : ' ​ after nine detections of a tagged white shark early today , the @entity34 is advising water users at @entity48 beach to exercise additional caution			1
@entity48 beach has been closed by the @entity75			2
' the detections occurred over the period from 3.55am to 7.22am			0
the shark was detected by a receiver that forms part of the @entity83 ’s @entity82			0
' water users should adhere to any beach closures advised by your local government rangers or @entity88			2
' they should also exercise caution when entering the water at @entity92 beaches and we encourage them to use patrolled beaches at all times			0
' @entity97 were reportedly the source of the nickname @entity3 , given in tribute to the 1400s @entity103 fighter @entity101			1
danger : authorities said swimmers should be cautious and only use patrolled beaches ( file photo ) she was just 19 when she was burned at the stake by the @entity112 during the @entity113 after helping lift the siege of @entity115 in just nine days			0
she was later made a saint			0
her shark namesake , meanwhile , is one of several being tracked by @entity7 's @entity34 using satellite data and hundreds of monitors on the sea bed			0
updates are sent live via @entity122 to swimmers and surfers , who have every reason to be cautious			0
a series of maulings , some of which were fatal , prompted authorities in @entity7 to set up a shark cull and spend almost $ 4million improving their warning systems			0
a @entity134 was formed in 2012 and last week authorities asked to extend their culling programme for another three years			0
the rules allow officials to kill and dump the bodies of any @entity2 , tiger or bull shark more than 10ft long after catching them using baited lines out to sea .			2
