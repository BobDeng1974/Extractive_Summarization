boy , would @entity0 like to find a fairway here , ’ said former professional @entity4			1
‘ preferably one attached to this hole			2
’ it was that sort of day			2
@entity0 had worked so hard on his short game , the other quality needed to take a safe passage through these parts had been forgotten			1
he chipped like a champion ; he drove like a boy racer			2
somewhere in the ether , golf ’s gods pointed and mocked			2
so @entity0 ’s short game is killing him ? opposite			1
there has been so much yip yap these last few weeks it was forgotten that @entity0 was becoming more erratic off the tee , long before his chipping went west			1
from the first , when he drifted into a bunker on the right , to the final par five , when he fired one into the crowd , castigating himself as a ‘ dumbass ’ — although a shout of ‘ fore ’ might have been more helpful — woods took the long road around @entity33			1
the galleries were packed as crowd favourite @entity0 struggled on his first round at @entity33 @entity0 reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell @entity0 feels the heat at @entity33 with the world no 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round that he recorded a relatively respectable score — some significant distance off the lead , but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months — was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent			1
@entity0 dug deep and his play around the greens saved him			1
it was remarkable , really , considering his crisis of confidence			2
on the sixth , a par three , @entity0 missed the green again			1
he looked more than irritated , he looked worn down , fed up with a sport he once held on a string			2
he no doubt remembers how it used to be , too			2
how he must miss that old @entity0			1
he walked to the ball , perched at the top of a small incline to the right of the green			2
rolled it down the slope , got it near enough			2
but , even so , it was a tell			2
the best poker players do n’t have tells and @entity0 likes @entity74 as much as any high roller			1
but he saw his hand and , on that occasion , he blinked			2
it was still a @entity0 gallery , of course			1
still the biggest , still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius			1
but they would have recognised this as @entity0 bluffing			1
rewind through a decade and he would have conjured something small and miraculous with a short iron , made the ball pitch and spit and stop almost at his command			2
he would have shown the mastery of a charmer with a mesmerised snake			2
putting from off the green ? that was for the old guys and the also - rans , those without the bravery or the genius to make the ball obey			2
so @entity0 got it close and made the solid up and down			1
sure , they ’re part of the game and every pro relies on them , even the all - time greats			2
but he was coming to need them , more and more			0
he wo n’t be entirely comfortable with that			0
he could n’t putt at the 11th , when he again missed right and left himself a rascal of a chip			0
if @entity0 ’s short game was as bad as it had looked last time , the ball could easily have taken a bath			1
instead , he recovered , just like old times			0
then put it in the water at the 12th instead			0
@entity117 ’s gods thumbed their noses and pulled faces behind his back			0
‘ i made two dumb mistakes , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that apart , it was a good day			0
the short game was my strength , it was the reason i worked my butt off — to make it my strength again			0
’ even so , dramatic saves were n’t all the old @entity0 was about			1
there was a shot on the seventh that would have been a contender for play of the day			0
that is why they continue to hurry when he has played , no matter the needs of his patient partners			0
@entity0 hits and off they go to see @entity0 hit again			1
but @entity0 is hitting more and more			1
not the 82 times he hit at the @entity141 in january perhaps , but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at @entity33 in the old days , when he would n’t have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes			1
boy it was a beauty			0
he was behind a tree , left of the fairway , barely in sight of the green			0
he took a giant hit , dug it out but with such power and ferocity			0
the crowd lost the flight , the cameraman too , but @entity159 did n’t			1
he skipped and peered around the forestry to see the ball drop out of the sky , onto the green to a sunday afternoon reception			0
momentarily it was 1997 all over again			0
and then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short			1
@entity169 woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th , but he managed to salvage par on the hole @entity159 ' beau @entity176 was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel woods , @entity182 and @entity184 walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day 's play increasingly , his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena can not cash			1
they were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee			1
eight on one side , six on the other , five marshals , wrestling with rope , and several baseball - hatted @entity200 security men			0
a local sheriff marched past , perspiring through his regulation white shirt			0
even for @entity33 in april it was unseasonably warm : 89 , according to the @entity205			1
it was approaching 1.48pm @entity207			0
the 14 rows fidgeted expectantly			0
@entity0 breezed through , to applause , cheers and the odd whoop ; the love of the common people			1
he nodded in appreciation once , mouthed a noiseless thank you , smiled a tight anti-smile			0
and then he was gone			0
swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him			1
will he , wo n’t he ? could he , could n’t he ? they had seen the man , but would they ever see the man ? he was coming here with a new game , and a new mindset , but was this a new @entity0 ? woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15 - time major winner had a solid start to the day @entity0 shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth , but he managed to steady the ship woods patrols the @entity33 fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world no 1 no. not a new @entity0 like the old @entity0 anyway			1
too much , too soon			0
he was better than the @entity0 that departed @entity240 in february , with fears for his long - term future			1
better for all that graft , that sun up to sun down perseverance			0
but he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world			1
a bit rusty , a bit erratic , a bit brilliant , a bit fallible			1
there were fine moments , but they were fleeting			0
he got better through the round , but he would have eaten this place alive in the good old days			0
and that is @entity0 ’s problem			1
it ’s a bit like @entity260 in @entity261			2
every time he tries to get out , they pull him back in			0
the creaks , the chunks , the odd crisis of confidence that just was n’t there before			0
he starts to get going , he works his ass off , but it is hard			0
he three - putted the first , birdied the second			0
hit a tree off the tee on the third , but got a lucky kick onto the fairway			0
found a bunker , then missed the green on the par three fourth , played a quite stunning second from a poor fairway lie on the fifth			0
it was the golf of a competitor still battling against the years , and the aches of a creaking back and — whisper it — maybe yips that could resurface at any time			0
he wo n’t go quietly , the competitor remains , but he is vulnerable now			0
if it is is n’t one thing , it ’s the other			0
@entity0 wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera @entity159 looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still @entity296 skies on a perfect day for golf woods finished the day at one over as he looks forlornly at a shot on the eighth			1

the @entity303 crowd wanted @entity0 to do well at @entity33
he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world . a bit erratic , a bit brilliant , a bit rusty , a bit fallible . and , fleetingly , a bit marvellous too
the gallery was 10 , 12 deep around the greens . still in awe . still ready to applaud even the tiniest glimmer
but the sizeable gallery is writing cheques the man in the arena can no longer cash
