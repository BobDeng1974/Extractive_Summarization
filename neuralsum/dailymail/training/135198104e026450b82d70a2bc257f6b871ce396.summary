so when the 24 - year - old saw an @entity12 news story about @entity13 , the 8 - year - old @entity14 girl waiting for a heart transplant , she says she could relate to her struggle			1
but she also noticed that @entity13 , like her , was a big @entity17 fan as well			1
on late tuesday morning , ms @entity2 , her mom , @entity35 , and dad , @entity37 , made a surprise visit to @entity13 in her hospital room to present her with the two tickets hidden inside a plastic @entity17 bag			1

ms @entity2 had contacted tv reporter @entity47 soon after she saw the story about @entity13			1
that paved the way for tuesday			0
as the big moment approached , several @entity4 staff waited in the hall , eagerly awaiting @entity13 's reaction , and @entity13 's mom , @entity55 , had her @entity56 ready to take video and pictures			1
strangers ; @entity13 did n't know @entity60 before tuesday morning when the 24 - year - old came into her hospital room with the purple @entity17 bag , seen overwhelming : @entity64 smiles after @entity22 discovered the two tickets hidden inside a @entity17 gift bag , before becoming overwhelmed and hiding , keeping both tickets in hand once news crews and ms @entity2 and her parents arrived in @entity13 's room , she presented @entity13 with the gift bag			1
@entity13 , who sat in a red @entity4 wagon — her back to the crowd — found a @entity17 book and @entity17 tattoos — but for a short period , the big gift was missing in action			1
finally , she dug it out from beneath piles of tissue paper			0
' do you know what those are ? ' @entity13 ’s mother @entity86 asked her			2
' tickets , ' said @entity13			2
' to ? ' her mom nudged			0
' a concert , ' @entity13 said			2
' who are you going to go see ? ' at that point , the 8 - year - old became just a little overwhelmed by all the excitement			0
thankful : @entity13 's mother @entity86 , right , was overcome with emotion from so many people , total strangers , that have reached out to help her daughter in the smallest ways in their time of trouble ' this is your surprise , @entity13			1
you get to go see @entity17 , in concert , ' her mother said			2
the crowd burst into applause			0
@entity13 had known for a while about a surprise — but she never imagined tickets to his concert			1
ms @entity2 told the @entity111 that initially , her family had planned to sell the extra tickets after mistakenly buying two more than needed , but when she saw the story about @entity13 , she knew , ' that 's where i wanted to give them			1
' ms @entity2 , who was born with a congenital heart defect , feels a strong connection to @entity13			1
' that 's the link to this story that makes it very , very sweet , ' said @entity124 , @entity2 's mom			2
her daughter has had three surgeries at @entity4 and now goes to the @entity4 outpatient center			0
@entity124 said the tickets are ' hope for the future — something for @entity13 to look forward to ' as she awaits a heart transplant			1
but ms @entity2 has other plans up her sleeve			0
much in common : @entity22 playfully hides behind a @entity17 cardboard inside her hospital room beside @entity2 , left , with both able to relate to not only a love of @entity17 but needing a heart transplant she 's working through social media and other means to try and arrange a meeting between @entity17 and @entity13			1
she 's emailed @entity141 , who is friends with @entity17 , and she 's also tweeting @entity17 ( but has n't heard back )			2
before the @entity144 left , ms @entity2 spent time talking to @entity13 and she hopes to come back and visit			2
@entity124 shared with @entity13 and @entity55 what had happened earlier in the day			0
the family had planned to bring a balloon bouquet , but then learned they could not take latex balloons into the hospital because of concerns about possible problems with allergies			0
