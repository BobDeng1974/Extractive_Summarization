by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 16 october 2013 car buyers are being forced to pay extra if they want the vehicle in a colour that the manufacturer says is beyond the norm , an investigation has found			1
it can cost buyers hundreds of pounds for basic colours			1
even white now costs extra as it overtakes metallic tints in the popularity stakes			0
experts fear motorists are becoming victims of ‘ fifty shades of rip - off ’			2
pricey : this @entity18 would cost you extra as it is not in the standard @entity20 , according to @entity21 an investigation by @entity21 magazine reveals that most mainstream brands now offer only one ‘ flat ’ or basic colour free of charge			1
and in most instances , customers will have to ‘ upgrade ’ to get greater choice - which pushes the price of the paint job beyond £ 500 for the majority of makers			0
the report says @entity35 car maker seat - part of the giant @entity36 - only sells a new @entity37 in @entity20 at no extra cost			1
it notes : ‘ however , if you want white paint , you ’ll have to shell out £ 175			0
prefer deep black metallic ? the price rises to £ 500			0
go a step further to the bronze - like @entity46 , and you ’ll pay £ 635			0
’ ' @entity47 ' : this white @entity48 comes at no extra cost , but any other colour commands a premium explaining why drivers are being forced to stump up more for a colour other than a flat red , a @entity34 spokesman told the magazine : ‘ the trend for white paint over the past five years has had the effect of diminishing the take - up of metallic over the same period			1
' obviously , paint is something we as a manufacturer have to purchase			0
and with fewer buyers choosing metallic as a cost option , we have to plug the financial gap by charging a nominal fee for certain ‘ flat ’ paints			2
' the @entity70 has only white as a ‘ no - cost ’ paint			2
the @entity21 investigation found that car makers charge the following range of prices for a non-standard paint job , depending on the exact colour and finish : @entity79 : £ 340 to £ 715 @entity48 : £ 450 to £ 600 @entity80 : £ 300 to £ 460 @entity81 : £ 495 to £ 545 @entity82 : £ 450 to £ 500 @entity83 : £ 435 to £ 495 @entity84 : £ 650 to £ 790 @entity85 : £ 550 to £ 800 @entity86 : £ 570 to £ 645 @entity87 : £ 450 to £ 720 @entity70 : £ 450 to £ 550 @entity88 : £ 450 to £ 550 @entity89 : £ 558 to £ 801 @entity90 : £ 495 @entity91 : £ 450 to £ 700 @entity36 : £ 460 to £ 595			1
the magazine says : ’ any other colour is offered as metallic only , and carries a £ 500 price tag			2
similarly the @entity48 has a flat white colour as the sole no - cost option			1
nor does the cost to the customer of these flat paint finishes vary according to the size of the car			1
@entity34 ’s non-metallic white costs the same £ 175 on smaller models like the @entity106 city car as it does on the much larger @entity37 seven - seater			0
at the super-luxury end of the market , @entity108 customers can pay up to £ 20,000 for their preferred satin finish and colour on a @entity113 or @entity114			0
it ’s a similar tale with @entity116 for its historical tints such as @entity118 , and @entity119			0
@entity21 editor in chief @entity121 said : ‘ never mind @entity122			1
one has to wonder whether motorists are victims of fifty shades of rip - off when it comes to a car ’s paint job			1
‘ paint specialist @entity128 who runs ‘ shine smart repair told @entity21 that several factors were to blame including an @entity132 directive in 2006 - 07 that all paints must be water - based rather than oil - based adding to research and development costs			1
he said : ’ this , of course , has a knock - on effect - and somebody has to pay for it			0
’ improved paint quality also comes at a price : ‘ look at a red car from 10 years ago , and it ’ll be pink because of oxidisation from the sun. that no longer happens			0
’ and the fashion for greater personalisation is giving car - makers some extra margin : ‘ about 30 to 40 per cent of the paint price is the genuine cost			2
the rest is what you have to pay for the ability to personalise your car			0
