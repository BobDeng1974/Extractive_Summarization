by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 31 october 2013 at a cemetery on the eastern fringes of @entity4 in @entity5 , a sombre , yet grand ceremony was taking place			1
a prosperous citizen was being buried just outside the city boundaries - no @entity9 , however rich , could be buried within the city walls to prevent the spread of disease			1
mourners muttered prayers to the sun god , @entity16 , as the body was laid to rest in its dark mausoleum			1
overlooking the body , at the far end of the tomb , loomed a majestic stone sculpture of a roman eagle clutching a writhing snake in its beak			1
this noble eagle would guarantee the protection of @entity28 , king of the gods , in the afterlife			1
beautifully preserved : @entity32 cleaning the sculpture of a @entity35 eagle and serpent which has been unearthed in the @entity37 after nearly 2,000 years			1
such tomb ornaments were prized by @entity9 nobility the sculpture , believed to be the best - preserved ever in @entity4 , was unearthed near @entity41 just outside the @entity9 city wall			1
not even the richest noblemen were buried inside the city for fear of disease spreading after nearly 2,000 years buried under the silt and mud and rubble of @entity4 , that eagle has been resurrected			1
if it had n’t been for a keen - eyed archaeologist , it might have remained hidden for many centuries more			1
on the last day of a dig in the @entity56 , archaeologist @entity54 came across a clump of muddy stone , clogged with clay			1
the sculpture was found at an archeological site , pictured , run by the @entity62 he and his team had been excavating the earth beneath a planned development of a 16 - storey hotel near the @entity68			1
the developers were due to begin construction the next day			1
the team had found a few interesting artefacts in the dig - a bit of pottery , some animal bones - but nothing as spectacular as what they were about to unearth			1
‘ i could n’t tell what it was at first , ’ says @entity54			1
‘ i washed it and came across a beak , then a gap , then a wing			1
and i realised it was an eagle			2
’ it was no ordinary eagle			2
it was a @entity9 eagle , from the first or second century @entity5 , in mortal combat with a snake			2
more than that , the eagle is the most sophisticated piece of @entity9 sculpture ever found in @entity4 - almost complete except for a chip on its wing			2
the eagle - on show in the @entity62 - symbolises @entity28 , the greatest of the @entity9 gods			2
and it adds another crucial layer to our understanding of @entity9			2
at the time the eagle was carved , @entity103 - as it was then known - was far from being a remote backwater of the @entity106			2
@entity107 , or @entity108 , may have been the capital of @entity9 , but the 330 acres of @entity103 - enclosed by three miles of @entity9 wall , much of which survives today - made it the biggest town in the country			1
not long after the @entity115 invaded @entity9 in @entity116 , @entity103 began its journey to becoming the metropolis it is today			1
we are discovering more and more about everyday @entity103 life , largely thanks to the development of new , modern buildings			2
earlier this year , 10,000 finds were excavated on the site of the new headquarters of the @entity128 media empire near @entity129 in central @entity4			2
among the discoveries , 23ft below ground level , were 250 leather shoes , pewter dinner plates , wooden writing tablets , copper brooches and lead plaques of prancing bulls			1
not to mention the biggest collection of phalluses from a single @entity142 - @entity141 site			2
these phalluses were used as good - luck charms , carried as aides to sexual potency and even used as decorations on horse harnesses			2
the @entity149 had a much more easy - going approach to sex - and its public display - than we do today			1
young girls were often captured and forced to work as sex slaves			1
it was one brutal way the @entity149 sought to subjugate the people they had conquered			1
brothel - tokens , such as this one on show at the @entity160 , right , were a little more racy than modern - day pound coins - routinely depicting couples in the act of love coins and tokens depicting sexual positions have been found in the mud of the @entity169			2
roman legionaries would have handed these to the brothel - keeper as payment for the act they desired			2
the poor girl who served them would never have seen any of the money			2
@entity178 , the @entity9 poet , wrote that the politicians in @entity180 kept the city ’s people under their thumb through ‘ panem et circenses ’ - bread and circuses			2
the same went for the residents of @entity4			2
give them food and entertainment , the thinking went , and they wo n’t rebel			0
in 1987 , @entity4 ’s @entity9 amphitheatre was unearthed in the @entity193			0
among the discoveries was a timber sliding trapdoor , used to release wild animals into the arena			1
@entity199 of the bill would have been shows in which animals were set against each other , public executions and gladiator battles			0
if they were successful in the ring , gladiators could become pin - ups			0
one @entity9 cup , discovered by archaeologists , is signed by a gladiator and a glamorous dancing girl , perhaps at the request of an early autograph - hunter			0
but even if they won the adulation of the crowds , gladiators and dancing girls were still slaves			1
if you were lucky enough to be a free @entity9 , life was sweet			0
when the @entity149 arrived , they set about importing their home city ’s luxuries to this damp and ill - provisioned island			1
archaeologists have found elegant furniture such as marble tables , cabinets and chairs with delicately carved lion ’s claw feet			0
excavated under @entity4 's @entity234 in 1988 , the city 's @entity232 was one of @entity9 's most spectacular archeological finds			0
features included trap doors from which animals could spring into the arena this artist 's impression shows how the amphitheatre would have looked in @entity244 , its @entity9 heyday londinium jewellery was as finely worked as anything on @entity248 today			0
finds include an amber amulet in the shape of a gladiator ’s helmet and exquisite hairpins			0
the @entity149 were great shoppers and party - givers			1
archaeologists have found wooden tablets inscribed with extensive shopping lists or invitations to lavish dinner parties			0
those tablets also reveal the names of @entity103 ’s inhabitants - showing a mixture of latin names and @entity266 ones			0
invaders lived right alongside the invaded			0
@entity268 - the @entity9 historian whose father - in - law , @entity269 , was governor of @entity9 from @entity270 to 85 - wrote about how striking the @entity141 natives were			0
the @entity272 had red hair and big limbs ; the @entity275 had dark skins and curly hair			0
the @entity141 were a superstitious lot , he added , given to aggression			0
when they settled in @entity4 , the @entity149 transformed the stodgy diet hitherto eaten in the city ’s taverns , introducing exotic imports from the @entity285			1
@entity4 archeologists have been unearthing landmark finds for many years			0
a temple to the sun god , @entity16 , was discovered in the street of @entity291 , @entity37 , in 1954 @entity292 , or urns , were brought over loaded with spices , wine and olives			0
pheasants - now the most common bird in the @entity141 countryside - were introduced by the @entity149 , who had encountered them in south - west @entity300			1
differences persisted , though , between the @entity9 and the native diet			0
in @entity5 , roman legionaries , serving at the @entity305 fort in @entity306 , wrote home to their families , asking for food packages : garlic , fish , olive oil , olives , lentils and wine			0
they did n’t care for the northern stodge favoured by the @entity317 , cereal and pork fat			0
what really got the @entity9 invaders down was the weather			0
in @entity323 , @entity268 said of our climate : ‘ @entity326 crebris imbribus ac nebulis foedum ’ - ‘ the @entity141 sky is obscured by constant rain and cloud ’			0
still , their oppressed @entity331 subjects had a lot more to be grumpy about : there was no doubt they were second - class citizens			0
no wonder that , in @entity339 , a great revolt against the @entity149 was led by @entity340 , @entity341 of a @entity266 tribe			1
during the rebellion , @entity103 was burnt down			0
the revolt was suppressed by @entity9 military might - and @entity340 died , either through illness or taking poison			0
the @entity149 subsequently changed their tactics , finding more subtle ways to control the natives			1
@entity268 explains how governor @entity269 set up latin schools for the sons of the native @entity141 upper class and introduced them to ‘ things with a touch of sinfulness to them ’ : drawing rooms , hot baths and elegant dinner parties			0
as @entity268 writes : ‘ in their stupidity , the @entity141 called this civilisation when it was all part of their servitude			0
’ the @entity149 did n’t just introduce us to baths , but also the gym			1
fragments of thermae - public baths combined with gyms - survive in the @entity37			0
we can thank them , too , for the @entity9 roads that head out of @entity4			0
for all their brilliance , those roads left one unfortunate legacy to the modern commuter : the narrowness of train and tube seats			0
the first @entity381 trains were built to the same width as horse - drawn wagons , which had themselves been designed to fit the ruts left by @entity9 chariots			1
the standard @entity141 rail gauge - 4ft 8½in - still mirrors the specification for a @entity9 war chariot			1
that figure , the @entity149 thought , reflected the size of a horse ’s bottom , with a little wriggle room on either side			1
as our own bottoms have grown bigger , those seats have become more and more uncomfortable			0
so next time you ’re tightly packed into the 5.37 from @entity401 , you know who to blame : the @entity403 of @entity103			0
@entity0 is author of @entity404 , @entity405 , @entity406 and all that — how to become a latin lover ( @entity408 ) .			0

find is the latest in a long line of *breathtaking* discoveries in the capital
@entity149 had a liberal attitude to sex , with brothels and sex slaves common
@entity420 stayed even into @entity381 era , *dictating* the standard rail gauge
