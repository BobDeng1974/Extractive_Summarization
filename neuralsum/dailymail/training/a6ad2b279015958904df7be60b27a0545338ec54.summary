@entity0 has told his @entity2 team - mates they must fight hard to ensure their unbeaten run stretches long into the new year			1
@entity4 endured a difficult start to life in @entity7 , but his @entity2 side are third in the table and are through to the fourth round of the @entity11 after an 11 - match unbeaten run			1
the last time @entity2 went on such a run was in sir @entity15 's final year in charge when the @entity17 went 18 matches without defeat			1
@entity2 defender @entity0 has called on his team - mates to work even harder to maintain form @entity4 's side are unbeaten in their last 11 matches - with their last defeat coming against @entity25 provided they beat fourth - place @entity27 on sunday , @entity2 's fixture list suggests they have a decent chance of stretching their current sequence to a similar length			1
@entity32 's team face @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 in the coming weeks , but @entity0 knows there is still plenty of hard work ahead if @entity2 are to remain unbeaten and cement their position in the top four			1
' @entity46 on the back of a good run means that it 's a case of working even harder to climb the table and get as many points as we can , ' the defender told @entity53			2
' we need to do as much as possible on the pitch and , as an individual , do as much as we can in terms of recovery and extra work			2
' after taking 13 points from his first 10 matches , @entity32 was keen to emphasise that @entity2 's form would improve once the principles of his philosophy had sunk in with the players			1
that philosophy has never been explained in public since @entity32 moved to @entity7 , but whatever its components , it is clearly rubbing off on the squad			2
' i think the key is to keep to the principles that the manager has set , ' smalling added ' the run shows that we 've got a bit of consistency			2
@entity0 appeared in @entity2 's last match against @entity80 outfit @entity79 @entity4 revealed on friday that @entity81 was @entity2 's only injured player ' i think we 've really shown our team spirit in games where we 've had to dig in or come from behind			1
it shows how well we all get on			0
' we 're all happy no matter what position we 're in and we work for each other			0
' if we can prolong our consistency and continue our hard work in training , things will click and we 'll creep up the league			0
' @entity32 is likely to stick with his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation due to some encouraging news from the treatment room			0
the @entity95 smiled broadly when he revealed only one player - @entity81 - was unavailable for sunday 's game against his old adversary @entity98			1
@entity99 has overcome an ankle injury and is fit to face his old club and @entity102 is also in contention after a two - month knee injury layoff			0
@entity105 has trained this week despite fracturing his cheekbone against @entity107 , but @entity32 is unlikely to take a gamble on the @entity109 as @entity110 is back after a groin strain			0
@entity99 and @entity105 are both available to face @entity27 on sunday afternoon ' they [ @entity99 and @entity105 ] can play , ' the @entity2 boss said			1
' they are both not injured			0
@entity105 was of course operated on [ his cheekbone ] , and maybe we do n't take any risk with him , but @entity99 can also play			0
' @entity32 is facing a dilemma regarding whether to play @entity118 , who was deemed fit enough only for a substitute appearance in the 2 - 0 @entity11 win over @entity107			0
' @entity118 has only played 20 minutes because of the match rhythm i gave him , ' @entity32 said of the @entity122 , who missed three matches over the festive period because of a hamstring injury			2
' i have said i only have one injured player but i do n't have 100 per cent match - fit players			0
' i have to select the best team and watch the qualities of @entity27			1

@entity0 has been *pleased* with his side 's recent *results*
@entity2 are unbeaten in their last 11 matches
