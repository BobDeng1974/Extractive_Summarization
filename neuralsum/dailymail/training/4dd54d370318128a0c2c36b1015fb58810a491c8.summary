moved by the @entity5 regime 's rapid advance , the @entity2 administration could decide this week to approve lethal aid for the beleaguered @entity8 rebels and will weigh the merits of a less likely move to send in @entity12 airpower to enforce a no - fly zone over the civil war - wracked nation , officials said sunday			1
@entity17 meetings are planned over the coming days , as @entity8 president @entity5 's government forces are apparently poised for an attack on the key city of @entity21 , which could cut off @entity8 's armed opposition from the south of the country			1
as many as 5,000 @entity26 fighters are now in @entity8 , officials believe , helping the regime press on with its campaign after capturing the town of @entity30 near the @entity32 border last week			2
opposition leaders have warned @entity34 that their rebellion could face devastating and irreversible losses without greater support , and the warnings are prompting the @entity12 to consider drastic action			0
secretary of state @entity40 has cancelled a @entity42 trip to be present at @entity17 talks over @entity8 running out of time : experts believe @entity12 intervention could be straw that finally breaks the back of @entity8 president @entity5 secretary of state @entity40 postponed a planned trip monday to @entity50 and three other @entity42 countries to participate in @entity17 discussions , said officials who were n't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity			1
while nothing has been concretely decided , @entity12 officials said president @entity2 was leaning closer toward signing off on sending weapons to vetted , moderate rebel units			1
the @entity12 has spoken of possibly arming the opposition in recent months but has been hesitant because it does n't want @entity61 - linked and other extremists fighting alongside the @entity64 militias to end up with the weapons			0
@entity2 already has ruled out any intervention that would require @entity12 military boots on the ground			2
other options such as deploying @entity12 air power to ground the regime 's jets , gunships and other aerial assets are now being more seriously debated , the officials said , while cautioning that a no - fly zone or any other action involving @entity12 military deployments in @entity8 were far less likely right now			2
the president also has declared chemical weapons use by the @entity5 regime a " red line " for more forceful @entity12 action			1
@entity12 allies including @entity85 and @entity86 have say they 've determined with near certitude that @entity8 forces have used low levels of sarin in several attacks , but the administration is still studying the evidence			0
the @entity12 officials said responses that will be mulled over in this week 's meetings concern the deteriorating situation on the ground in @entity8 , independent of final confirmation of possible chemical weapons use			1
@entity17 spokeswoman @entity100 said @entity2 's advisers were considering all options to hasten a transition in @entity8			1
" the @entity12 will continue to look for ways to strengthen the capabilities of the @entity8 opposition , " she said			0
civil war : to date 100,000 people have been killed in the war between @entity5 's regime and rebel fighters any intervention could have wide - reaching ramifications for the @entity12 and the region			1
t would bring the @entity12 closer to a conflict that has killed almost 80,000 people since @entity5 cracked down on protesters inspired by the @entity119 in march 2011 and sparked a war that has since been increasingly defined by sectarian clashes between the @entity123 - led rebellion and @entity5 's @entity125 - dominated regime			1
and it would essentially pit the @entity12 alongside regional allies @entity126 , @entity128 and @entity129 in a proxy war against @entity131 , which is providing much of the materiel to the @entity8 government 's counterinsurgency and , through @entity26 , more and more of the manpower			2
@entity8 's precarious position in the heart of the @entity42 makes the conflict extremely unpredictable			0
@entity32 , across the western border , suffered its own brutal civil war in the 1970s and the 1980s and is already experiencing increased interethnic tensions			1
@entity143 , to @entity8 's east , is mired in worsening violence			0
and @entity50 to the southwest has seen shots fired across the contested @entity147 and has been forced to strike what it claimed were advanced weapons convoys heading to @entity26 , with whom it went to war with in 2006			0
@entity131 could wreak havoc in the region through its support of @entity158 militant groups , and @entity12 officials fear @entity131 may seek to retaliate for any stepped - up @entity12 involvement by targeting @entity50 or @entity12 interests in the region			0
it 's also unclear what @entity12 action would mean for relations with @entity166 , which has provided @entity5 with military and diplomatic support even as it claims that it working with the @entity12 to try to organize a @entity8 peace conference			1
at the same time , it 's unclear how @entity34 could fundamentally change the trajectory of a conflict that has increasingly tilted toward @entity5 in recent months without providing weapons to the opposition forces or getting involved itself			2
the administration has been studying for months how to rebalance @entity8 's war so that moderate , pro-democracy rebels defeat the regime or make life so difficult for @entity5 and his supporters that the government decides it must join a peace process that entails a transition away from the @entity186 's four - decade dictatorship			1
but @entity5 's military successes appear to have rendered peace efforts largely meaningless in the short term			0
while @entity40 and his @entity166 counterpart @entity190 have been trying to rally support for the planned conference in @entity193 - first envisioned for may and since postponed until july at the earliest - even @entity12 's allies in the @entity8 opposition leadership have questioned the wisdom of sitting down for talks while they are ceding territory all over the country to @entity5 's forces			1
force : the @entity202 has 300,000 soldiers while the number of rebel fighters is estimated at around 35,000 beyond weapons support for the rebels , administration officials harbor deep reservations about other options			2
they note that a no - fly zone , championed by hawks in @entity213 such as sen. @entity214 , @entity215 , would require the @entity12 to first neutralize @entity8 air defense systems that have been reinforced with @entity166 technology and are far stronger than those that @entity220 dictator @entity219 had before the @entity12 and its @entity222 and @entity223 allies helped rebels overthrow him in 2011			1
and unlike with @entity220 , @entity34 has no clear international mandate for authorizing any strikes inside @entity8 , a point the @entity2 administration has harped on since late 2011 to explain its reticence about more forceful action			2
@entity21 has one of the biggest @entity125 communities in @entity8 and is widely seen as @entity234			0
the rebels control the city center , however , with regime forces besieging them on the outskirts			0
many towns north of @entity21 also are rebel - controlled , while to the south @entity26 - backed government forces have been clearing rebels from villages and towns			0
fierce fighting there over the past three weeks has killed dozens of rebels , troops and @entity26 fighters and wounded hundreds			0
seizing control of @entity21 would clear a path for the regime from @entity252 to the @entity254 coast , and firm up its grip on much of the country .			0

nearly 80,000 people have been killed during the @entity8 civil war
