when you next visit your gp , or have to see a hospital consultant , you probably wo n’t mind whether he or she went to a private or a state school			1
what we want most of our doctors is that they should be competent and caring			0
but it is nonetheless a shocking fact that half the schools in this country do not produce a single pupil to study medicine			1
that means more than 2,000 institutions educating many tens of thousands of children can not muster one prospective doctor between them			1
the devastating report by the @entity19 also shows that about half of applicants to do medicine come from private schools ( which educate only 7 per cent of children ) and grammar schools ( of which there remain a mere 164 in @entity27 )			1
half the schools in this country do not produce a single pupil to study medicine			1
that means more than 2,000 institutions educating many tens of thousands of children can not muster one prospective doctor between them there are only 8,000 places a year at medical school , and competition is incredibly stiff			1
given the number of foreign doctors , some of whom speak bad @entity27 and are poorly trained , one wonders why there are not more places for home - grown students			0
in other words , your bright child hoping to be a doctor might as well forget it , unless he or she is fortunate enough to attend a private school , a grammar , or one of the best comprehensives			1
of course , it ’s very hard to be accepted to train to be a doctor			0
half our schools have very few , if any , pupils achieving a * grades at a-level in subjects such as @entity63			1
there are only 8,000 places a year at medical school , and competition is incredibly stiff			1
given the number of foreign doctors , some of whom speak bad @entity27 and are poorly trained , one wonders why there are not more places for home - grown students			0
but even if there were , there ’s no reason to suppose they would be filled by any of those 50 per cent of schools currently failing to supply any applicants			1
what ’s true of medicine is also true of the law , investment banking and maybe even the media			1
tens of thousands of gifted children are not getting a look - in because they are unlucky enough to be educated at what @entity88 ( @entity89 ’s spin doctor ) once described as ‘ bog - standard comprehensives ’			1
there are still many hundreds of them			0
according to @entity96 ’s annual report published yesterday , there are now 170,000 pupils in inadequate schools ( up from 70,000 more than two years ago )			1
nearly a third of secondary schools are rated as requiring improvement			1
is n’t @entity96 being wildly over-generous ? the 50 per cent of state schools which are not producing any would - be doctors are surely all deficient , and stand urgently in need of a shake - up			1
not that they are likely to get one			0
think of the appalling waste and the injustice of it all — the thousands of able children , nearly all from poor backgrounds , who will never be doctors or lawyers because the education they have received does not even get them to first base			1
and whereas 30 years ago the acting profession was led by people from such a background , now it is brimming with those educated at private school , and quite often @entity123			1
@entity124 - pictured above in @entity126 - @entity125 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 all benefited from the wonderful theatrical resources at that school , while @entity132 went to @entity133 but it is not just the citadels of medicine and the law from which they are excluded			1
according to a survey in 2010 , 60 per cent of pop singers are privately educated			1
that ’s one line of business in which working - class people were once expected to predominate			0
and whereas 30 years ago the acting profession was led by people from such a background , now it is brimming with those educated at private school , and quite often @entity123			2
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 all benefited from the wonderful theatrical resources at that school , while @entity132 went to @entity133			2
half of @entity152 ’s gold medallists at the @entity153 were privately educated — and thus enjoyed superior sporting facilities — though 93 per cent of children attend state schools			1
and , of course , we have a prime minister who went to @entity123 , a deputy prime minister who attended @entity161 , and a chancellor who , besides being the heir to a baronetcy , was lucky enough to go to @entity165 in @entity166			0
thirty or 40 years ago , this reassertion of privilege would have seemed incredible			0
then , it seemed crystal clear that the hold which the privately educated had on the great prizes of politics and the professions was loosening , and that @entity152 was becoming an increasingly open and meritocratic society			1
well , it has n’t turned out like that			0
the clock has turned back			0
and the main reason it has done so is that the path by which clever children from poorer backgrounds were once able to advance has been narrowed by the virtual demise of grammar schools			1
it ’s obvious that the @entity187 , which killed off most of the grammars , has no solution to the widening gulf between private schools and the state sector which is so injurious to our society			2
there was a time when the best grammar schools were academically equal , or even superior , to the best private schools , supplying as many , and sometimes more , students to @entity200			2
the few that remain generally do an excellent job , but are sadly limited to a small proportion of pupils			0
it ’s obvious that the @entity187 , which killed off most of the grammars , has no solution to the widening gulf between private schools and the state sector which is so injurious to our society			2
all it does is wail covetously at the privileges and the facilities of private education , which it aims to undermine but dare not abolish			0
meanwhile , the @entity216 has fiddled at the edges			0
with the utmost respect to @entity220 — who was a brave and enterprising education secretary until his recent sacking — his academies and his free schools , welcome though they are , will not fill the gap left by the abolition of the grammar schools			2
ironically , i ’m sure mr @entity220 shares my analysis			0
he passionately believes that bright pupils from poorer backgrounds deserve a better chance in life			2
yet he can not bring himself to embrace grammar schools because @entity234 weakly regards them as too toxic an issue			2
will there ever be change ? despite the obduracy of the @entity239 and the feebleness of the @entity216 hierarchy , i ’m not without hope because the weight of evidence is so irresistible , and the public increasingly realises that it is			0
the question politicians must address is how children from disadvantaged backgrounds are ever to be put on an equal footing with the children of the well - off without some sort of return of selective education for the brightest			2
no one has proposed a more plausible solution than the revival of grammars			0
the question politicians must address is how children from disadvantaged backgrounds are ever to be put on an equal footing with the children of the well - off without some sort of return of selective education for the brightest			2
no one has proposed a more plausible solution than the revival of grammars			0
arguments about the evils of separating children at 11 are sterile			2
selection could possibly be done later			0
and obviously no one is proposing a return to secondary moderns			0
grammar schools would sit alongside , and compete with , comprehensives			2
fortunately , there is some evidence of a shift in @entity216 sentiment			0
in recent weeks , @entity279 ( another @entity280 ) has declared that scrapping grammar schools was a ‘ real tragedy ’ for @entity152 , while his rival as a future @entity216 leader , @entity283 , has supported the creation of a new grammar school in her constituency			1
sixty @entity216 mps , including @entity290 secretary @entity289 and former shadow home secretary @entity291 , are calling for an end to the ban on the creation of new selective state schools			2
if @entity187 should win the next election , the 164 grammar schools will be lucky to survive			0
but if the @entity299 were to emerge victorious , and @entity234 were at last to show some guts and conviction , there is a chance that the greatest single engine of social mobility could be restored			1
look at the facts , and weep			0
half of schools — half of schools — do not put forth a single candidate to become a doctor			1
what a shameful waste and dereliction this is			0
sir @entity315 , the discoverer of penicillin , went to a fine grammar school that has become a less distinguished comprehensive			0
the same is true of @entity319 and @entity320 , the two pioneers of @entity322			0
would any of them even be admitted to medical school today ? i doubt it			0
like thousands of talented people abandoned by the state education system , they probably would not be given a chance .			1

half the schools in the @entity152 do not produce a single pupil to study medicine
tens of thousands of children are not getting a chance *due* to their school
pop stars , actors and top *athletes* are all coming from top schools
