shocking scene : dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black @entity11 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in @entity15 , @entity16 fall : one animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf , dismounting a rider , after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump which could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs a number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event on march 28			1
one rider reported visiting @entity44 to be treated for badly bruised ligaments after her horse fell			2
one complaint sent to welfare officers warned that ‘ someone could have been killed ’ at the event			2
it said : ‘ the public were asked to attend a charity “ hack ” which is supposed to be a casual walk ; trot through road or forest trails with your horse with an odd natural fence to jump – i.e. trees or ditches			2
‘ in reality some the horses were made jump extremely dangerous obstacles , one being a car with glass still within and over atrocious ground conditions which is nothing short of animal cruelty			1
' it added : ‘ from these pictures some of these animals are clearly not fit enough to be partaking in any jumping activities , ridden by people who had no regard for the safety of them			0
’ the complainant said a friend had attended the event , believing it would be in a good cause for charity , but was ‘ utterly shocked at what she witnessed , advising many horses were beaten ’			2
‘ one particular horse left with the skin from his chest between his legs torn and hanging off , ’ they added			0
‘ there was a flap of skin hanging down between the horse ’s legs			0
’ getting up : a number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event in @entity3 the @entity103 said today that complaints had been made after the horses were ‘ exploited and abused ’ in the ‘ obviously dangerous ’ event			1
a spokesman told @entity107 : ‘ people have quite rightly felt the animals were being exploited and abused			0
our point would be that the riders have the choice , but the horses do n’t			0
’ @entity114 - which has the power to prosecute , unlike the @entity116 - said its animal welfare and agriculture officials are aware of the incident and are investigating			1
but @entity120 , 34 , who organised the event , said she had originally planned for the car to feature as a jump obstacle - but it was intended to be a ' photographic prop ’ on the day			1
she told the @entity126 : ‘ on the morning of the ride - out i had delegated a number of tasks , one of which was to close the pallets across the approach to the jump and hang a red flag on it			0
‘ unfortunately due to time constraints and confusion within the delegated voluntary assistants , this instruction was not executed , with the unfortunate consequence that a few riders out of the entire field of 65 riders elected of their own will to deviate from the designated clearly marked route which involved a modest jump over a ditch			0
’ the charity supported by the race , @entity150 , said its trustees were not aware of the fundraiser - and would only comment on what had happened once it had investigated the matter .			0
