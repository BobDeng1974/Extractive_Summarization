@entity1 's suitability to run a human rights charity in @entity3 has been brought into question because of his record in hushing up torture concern was growing in @entity3 yesterday over @entity1 ’s suitability to run a human rights charity given his track record in hushing up torture			1
his past involvement in covering up the dark practice threatens to tarnish the reputation of the @entity15 , its supporters warned			1
some donors to the highly regarded humanitarian charity are now openly questioning whether he is the right man to be its president			1
they are demanding he clear the air by returning to @entity22 to give evidence to a judge - led inquiry			0
mr @entity1 , who landed the £ 300,000 - a - year job last year after quitting @entity28 politics , has always denied suppressing evidence of torture			1
in 2010 , however , he spent £ 213,000 of taxpayers ’ money in legal fees battling in the @entity34 to stop details emerging of the appalling treatment of @entity37 , the @entity28 resident and former @entity39 inmate			1
now his role in the cover - up is coming under renewed scrutiny following the appalling torture revelations by the @entity3 @entity45 committee			2
dr @entity46 , a retired kidney specialist who , according to the charity ’s website , donated between $ 5,000 ( £ 3,100 ) and $ 10,000 to the @entity15 last year , said he would be ‘ very surprised ’ if , as foreign secretary , mr @entity1 had not known what was going on			1
the 63 - year - old professor at @entity52 in @entity53 said : ‘ the question really comes down to : did @entity1 know there was , what i would consider , torture being used ? if he knew about that , if he had anything to do with it , i think that ’s an important issue			1
‘ maybe somebody who knows something about that , and does n’t say anything , should give some justification as to why they kept quiet			0
and if they ca n’t , it makes you wonder if they should be leading an organisation like the @entity15			2
’ @entity71 , another $ 5,000 - $ 10,000 donor , said that it was an ‘ ethical ’ organisation and he did not want anything to tarnish that			0
@entity1 paid £ 213,000 of taxpayers ' money in an attempt to stop details emerging of the appalling treatment of @entity37 , a @entity28 @entity39 inmate the 78 - year - old , from @entity82 in @entity83 , said : ‘ being forthcoming is best			1
i certainly would n’t want anything to harm the @entity15 because they do good work helping some of the poorest people in the world			2
’ asked if mr @entity1 should return to the @entity28 to give evidence before @entity90 , @entity91 , 81 , who lives in @entity93 and has donated a similar amount , said : ‘ yes , i agree			2
’ the @entity15 , founded at the request of @entity96 in 1933 , helps refugees from 40 countries including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
its directors and ‘ overseers ’ include @entity105 , former @entity107 chief @entity106 and princess @entity108			0
working from an office in @entity110 , mr @entity1 earns more than @entity111 and counts former president @entity112 among his friends			0
@entity1 also secretly plotted to hand @entity114 to the @entity116 authorities while leading his family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the @entity28 last month , he was schmoozing with singer sting and @entity120 actor sir @entity119 at a gala dinner at the @entity122			0
in the @entity3 , he is called mr @entity123 , following the @entity3 custom of using his old title as foreign secretary , but he has spoken of enjoying being relatively ‘ anonymous ’ in @entity53 compared with his high profile in the @entity28			0
the @entity15 ’s funding comes mainly from taxpayers – including £ 110million of @entity28 aid money – in the form of grants to fund its international relief programmes			0
speaking in advance of the @entity45 committee ’s findings on the @entity137 , mr @entity1 said torture was ‘ reprehensible ’			1
he claims that he ‘ was n’t suppressing anything ’ , but he has also acknowledged for the first time the possibility that the @entity3 misled @entity28 ministers .			0
