@entity1 rugby head coach @entity0 has been told performances during the autumn series were unacceptable			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity4 said he felt ‘ frustrated ’ and ‘ disappointed ’ watching @entity1 extend their losing streak against @entity7 and @entity8 to five tests before victories over depleted @entity11 and @entity12 belatedly salvaged the autumn			1
@entity4 , who awarded the @entity1 coaching team unprecedented six - year contracts in october , will hold a full review with @entity0 in the coming weeks , but his end - of - term report delivered to the head coach clearly read : must do better			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity4 has demanded that @entity0 improves @entity1 's performances @entity0 has been told he must get more out of his team with the @entity21 taking place next year though stopping well short of questioning @entity24 ’s future and insisting @entity1 remain firmly on track for next year ’s @entity21 , @entity4 said : ‘ we have to be and we should be in a position where we go into every game expecting to win and wanting to win			1
‘ therefore if you lose , whether it ’s to @entity7 or @entity8 , it ’s a combination of frustrating and disappointing			1
we need to make sure we ’re doing all we can to remedy that			2
‘ @entity11 and @entity12 it was nice to get a couple of wins			2
but to be clear ; we should be expecting to win every game we play			2
we are extremely committed to ensuring that happens			2
you find it very frustrating			2
i sat in @entity7 and watched us lose three			2
you then lose again to them			0
‘ for a lot of the games we were highly competitive			0
but we still fell short , so it ’s not an accident when you lose four out of four			0
’ @entity1 began the autumn missing seven @entity45 through injury while @entity0 ’s decision to select inexperienced backs , including @entity49 youngsters @entity50 and @entity51 , left the side lacking some international experience			1
@entity0 was criticised for picking the inexperienced duo of @entity51 ( left ) and @entity50 ‘ i ’m not going to sit here , and i do n’t think @entity0 does either , saying there are reasons why this happened or that happened , ’ @entity4 added			1
‘ i do n’t think it ’s really worth doing that			0
‘ we have to make sure that , come the most important day next september we are absolutely in the right place to do that			1
do n’t take anything in terms of “ this is a development team ” or “ we ’re a learning team ”			0
‘ no , no , no. we need to be and have to be competitive and beat those teams			0
we have to be in a position of beating every team			0
‘ i think it ’s been a very good schedule			0
i do n’t make any apologies for that because i think we want to be playing the best in the world and judging ourselves			0
but we want to do better			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) congratulates @entity1 team captain @entity75 after victory over @entity12 @entity1 ’s next match is against @entity78 in @entity79 on february 6 and @entity4 remains confident @entity24 and his coaching team will turn results around			1
‘ do i still believe fervently that we are in a good position for next season and for @entity21 ? i absolutely do , ’ he added			1
‘ i think we have the talent , the ability and i think we have the resources and commitment to back up the team			0
