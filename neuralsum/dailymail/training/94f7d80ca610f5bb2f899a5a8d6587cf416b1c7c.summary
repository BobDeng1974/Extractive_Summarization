yesterday it was reported she had initially been sent home three times after going to a gp and @entity21 complaining of sickness			0
investigation : five members of staff at @entity26 have been vaccinated after coming into contact with the woman each time she was sent home because doctors believed her symptoms were ‘ vague ’			1
now hospital staff claim the diagnosis was hampered because she failed to mention her trip or the dog bite			2

specialist treatment : the patient is in an isolation room at @entity44 , @entity41 ( above ) after developing symptoms within the last fortnight she returned the next day but the hospital refused to admit her believing she was suffering from a mild illness			2
a source at the hospital said : ‘ had the staff been properly informed about this woman ’s trip to @entity7 , and especially that she had been bitten by a dog there , alarm bells would have rung immediately and the whole approach to her treatment would have been totally different to what happened			1
’ it was only when she visited her gp again last friday – four days after the first appointment – rabies was suspected			2
deadly : the grandmother 's illness is the first case of rabies in @entity86 in almost seven years			1

but even if she had been diagnosed sooner it is unlikely her chances of recovery would have been any higher			0
