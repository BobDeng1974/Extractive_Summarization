@entity0 was resigned to feeling ill forever			1
for four years she lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness , distorted vision and chronic tiredness , with doctors at a loss to explain what was wrong			1
@entity0 had also become sensitive to light and noise			1
‘ gradually my symptoms became more and more frequent until they occurred daily and meant i could n’t work for ten months , ’ says @entity0 , 42 , a customer service adviser who lives in @entity12 with her partner @entity13 , 49 , who works in retail			1
she had been back and forth to doctors dozens of times and wrongly told she had everything from the ear complaint labyrinthitis to chronic fatigue syndrome to vertigo			1
for four years @entity0 , 42 , lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness , distorted vision and chronic tiredness			1
her symptoms were actually migraines , brought on by the early stages of the menopause the correct diagnosis , when it finally came , was a surprise			1
her symptoms were actually migraines , brought on by the early stages of the menopause			1
‘ i had n’t had any other menopausal symptoms , such as night sweats or hot flushes , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ and i had no idea migraines could be a sign of the menopause or that migraines could occur without a headache			1
’ many women , like @entity0 , are unaware that the onset of migraines , or experiencing more frequent or severe migraines , can be a sign the menopause is approaching — but experts say it ’s surprisingly common			1
the problem is that these women may not necessarily develop headaches — the symptoms vary widely and can include visual disturbances such as seeing flashing lights and zig - zag lines , fatigue , neck pain , mood change , poor memory , restless legs , dizziness and sensitivity to light and noise			1
usually these occur in the days preceding the headache — known as the premonitory phase of the migraine — but in some people the headache never strikes			0
‘ i regularly see female patients in their 40s whose migraine became chronic , meaning they occur on more than 15 days each month in the lead up to the menopause , ’ says dr @entity68 , a consultant neurologist from the @entity69 in @entity12 , who treated @entity0			1
‘ often they have n’t realised they are perimenopausal			0
some have never had migraine before			0
’ the perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts , on average , for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts			1
research recently presented to the @entity86 found women get as many as 60 per cent more migraines in the years before and at the start of the menopause , and that along with hot flushes and depression , migraine can be a symptom of the menopause			1
there is a strong hormonal link to migraines — which may explain why women are more likely to get them than men			2
the perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts , on average , for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts and , says dr silver , it ’s not just when a woman is menopausal — migraines often occur at stages of hormonal change , but because they can bring a variety of symptoms they can be easily overlooked or misdiagnosed			1
‘ oestrogen drops in the middle of the menstrual cycle and just before each period starts , which are the most common times for migraine to occur in women , ’ says dr silver			0
‘ when a girl ’s periods first start , they may experience a headache and / or a form known as abdominal migraine — causing predominant tummy pain			0
' because they can occur without headache , this can sometimes be dismissed as period pains			0
’ many women find their migraines improve during pregnancy when the hormones remain relatively constant			2
after pregnancy , however , they often return , but the symptoms , which can include fatigue and depression , may be mistaken for post-natal depression especially as these symptoms can seem more prominent than a headache			2
‘ women may be given anti-depressants unnecessarily , but because they can improve migraine in some people , they think a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis was correct , though other treatments may be more appropriate , ’ says dr silver			2
but it ’s not just these women who get misdiagnosed			0
dr @entity68 says : ‘ up to 80 per cent of migraine and headache disorders may be given the wrong diagnosis , ’ and often people mistakenly get told they have psychological problems or even stress instead			2
migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors			0
when they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound			0
when it comes to treating hormone - related migraines , there ’s some disagreement among specialists			1
‘ when evidence clearly shows women are having migraine related to hormones , for example during the perimenopause or at the start of every period , an oestrogen gel which stabilises oestrogen levels can be prescribed by @entity189 , ’ says professor @entity175 , a former consultant gynaecologist at the @entity176 and @entity177 , @entity178			0
‘ this virtually always stops migraines for good			2
but not enough people are treated with it as they should be , because neurologists and gps often try preventative anti-migraine drugs instead			0
' they are n’t aware of the oestrogen treatment or do n’t always realise the migraines are linked to hormones			2
‘ women put up with a lot of suffering without treatment			0
’ migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors however , dr @entity68 disagrees and believes hormone treatment should typically be a last resort , saying it can occasionally be risky and have side - effects			2
instead , he says these patients should be treated the same as others with migraine			0
changing lifestyle factors can dramatically improve migraine in 40 per cent of patients , he says — this includes drinking more water , eating meals regularly , sleeping and waking at the same time each day , avoiding caffeine ( in coffee , tea , green tea , cola and chocolate ) and regular use of painkillers			0
if this does n’t help , the next options are drugs such as candesartan , propranalol or topiramate that are also used to treat epilepsy and high blood pressure or anti-depressants which work on chemical messengers in the brain			0
@entity240 injections are also used and are thought to reduce pain signals from various receptors to the brain			0
‘ when none of these measures work we can look at hormonal treatments , usually a low - dose @entity249 patch , ’ says dr silver			2
@entity249 works like oestrogen gel , to balance out levels of oestrogen in the body			0
some may also contain a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone			0
however , in women under 50 who experience problems with aura — usually visual disturbances such as flashing lights or zigzag lines — this treatment doubles their risk of stroke , although the overall risk is still very low			0
most women with hormone - related migraines will find they stop or become less frequent after the menopause			1
@entity0 finally discovered what was causing her crippling symptoms when a physiotherapist helping with her balance issues told her she had migraine - associated vertigo , not headaches , and referred her to dr silver			1
by then , her migraines had taken over her life			2
‘ @entity13 and i used to travel and socialise a lot but by then we could n’t even watch telly together because the screen would set me off , and i could n’t stand any noise without it causing pain , ’ says @entity0			1
migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors			0
when they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound			0
migraine is among the three most prevalent health conditions worldwide , along with anaemia and hearing loss			0
severe migraine attacks are classified by the @entity297 as among the most disabling illnesses , comparable to dementia , quadriplegia and active psychosis			0
it is the least publicly funded of all neurological illnesses relative to its economic impact			0
in the @entity307 there are an estimated 190,000 migraine attacks every day			0
‘ sometimes my fatigue was so bad i ’d sleep for 14 hours and then by the time i got down the stairs i ’d feel exhausted again			2
’ when dr @entity68 looked back through her medical history , he could see she had been having hormone - related migraines earlier in her life			1
' @entity0 had n’t realised what it was , but as a teenager she had felt ill on the first day of each period for a couple of years			1
‘ i would get awful stomach ache which i thought were just period pains			0
‘ i ’d never thought they were migraines as i did n’t have headaches , but looking back i realise they were — as well as abdominal pain , sometimes i saw flashing lights , my hearing would go , and i ’d feel sick and faint			1
’ when dr @entity68 explained the link between her latest symptoms and the menopause , it immediately made sense			2
‘ shortly after the dizziness and visual symptoms started , my periods became lighter and less regular — signs of the perimenopause , ’ explains @entity0 , whose mother and grandmother both had an early menopause at 40			1
as she was under 50 and experienced migraine aura she was not given @entity249 , but tried a number of treatments that did n’t work			0
however , since last august she has found taking candesartan blood pressure pills , prescribed by dr silver , combined with @entity240 , acupuncture and reflexology has reduced the severity of her migraines , so she can now work from home and socialise again			2
‘ my life still is n’t back to normal , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i never knew the menopause could trigger anything like this , or that migraines could be so debilitating			1

@entity0 suffered debilitating migraines for fours years
she went back and forth to the doctors and was diagnosed with the ear complaint *labyrinititis* , chronic fatigue and vertigo
her true diagnosis *shocked* her - she was in the early stages of menopause
she said : ' i had no idea migraines could be a sign of the menopause '
