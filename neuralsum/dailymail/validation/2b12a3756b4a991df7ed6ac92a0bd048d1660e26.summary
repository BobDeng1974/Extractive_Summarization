a left - wing ‘ super-union ’ with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of @entity3 ’s biggest donor unite and the biggest civil service union after the election , senior conservatives fear			1
they warn that a merger between the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) and the unite union would threaten the impartiality of @entity14			1
half of all civil servants are members of the @entity11 , which is not currently politically affiliated			1
if the two unions merged , they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is @entity3 ’s biggest financial supporter			2
unite , which has donated millions to labour since @entity22 became leader of the party , could be set to merge with the @entity10 unite is at least five times larger than @entity11 , which claims a membership of 270,000			1
unite , which has made £ 14.3million in donations to @entity3 since @entity22 became leader in 2010 , has 1.42million members			1
a @entity32 source said : ‘ a takeover of @entity11 by @entity3 ’s biggest donor , @entity25 , would make over half of all civil servants members of a @entity3 - affiliated union			1
‘ @entity11 and @entity25 must come clean about their secret plans			2
no takeover can be permitted to imperil the perceived impartiality of the civil service			0
’ the @entity11 has been in financial difficulty following cuts to the civil service , as well as an end to a system where @entity47 departments automatically deducted union dues from the payroll			0
a leaked document suggests it plans to sell its headquarters to a private equity fund and suspend national elections for this year			0
the union blames its financial crisis on the downsizing of the civil service , now a fifth smaller than it was in 2010			0
the end of the ‘ check off system ’ , which saw union fees deducted automatically from salaries by many government departments has also squeezed the @entity11 @entity63 have warned a left - wing merger between the @entity11 ( @entity25 protest pictured ) would threaten the impartiality of @entity14 cabinet office minister @entity67 has overseen the closure of this scheme at the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , the @entity73 and the @entity74			1
in addition , the government has clamped down on so - called ‘ facility time ’ , whereby union officials are paid by the taxpayer to work for a union			0
the overall cost of such taxpayer - subsidised union officials has fallen by more than two - thirds , while the number of full - time union officials paid for by the public purse has fallen from over 200 to fewer than ten			0
last year , the @entity11 discussed the possibility of a merger with @entity25 at its annual conference , but the idea was shelved			1
a source at the @entity11 played down the prospect of the deal with @entity25 being revived , saying : ‘ it ’s no secret that we had informal discussions			2
these proposals were never driven by finances			0
our conference voted against a motion from the national executive saying we should carry on exploring it , and said we should set more formal conditions			0
so it ’s not on the horizon			0
’ @entity25 ’s general secretary @entity104 suggested last year there would be ‘ no further progress ’ on merger talks with the @entity11 unless it changed its membership rules			2
hinting at the reasons for the breakdown of talks , he told delegates ‘ our rules do n’t change , our structures do n’t change ’			0
@entity11 members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with @entity25 if their union membership fees contributed to @entity3 coffers .			1
