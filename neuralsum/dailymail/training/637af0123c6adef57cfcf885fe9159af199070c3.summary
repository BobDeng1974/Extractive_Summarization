a feckless father who has 18 children by ten women says his human rights have been violated – because council bosses only gave him a four - bedroom house			2
@entity6 , 64 , says the town hall has a ‘ duty of care ’ to upgrade him and his large brood to a six - bedroom home on the @entity11			1
a larger property would be worth at least £ 300,000 but mr @entity6 , who has not worked for more than 20 years , lives off benefits and claims he had to give up work to care for his offspring			1
on handouts : @entity6 ( seated left ) , five of his children , two children , and his son - in - law @entity20 , who stays at the house four nights a week			1
mr @entity6 says the council has a duty of care to give them more space the single father says his current home is too cramped for himself and the five children and two grandchildren who live there – son @entity28 , 19 , daughters @entity33 , 18 , @entity34 , 15 , @entity35 , 14 , @entity36 , 17 , and her one - year - old twins @entity38 and @entity39			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ they are making out i ’m a bum			1
why does it matter that i ’m on benefits ? ‘ they are discriminating against me and the kids			0
the council has a duty of care , to make sure we have a decent place to live			2
‘ they have abused my human rights			0
they are treating me and my children like second class citizens			0
’ mr @entity6 said the family like their home in @entity57 , but claims one room is covered in mould and the fourth bedroom is so small it ‘ may as well be a cabinet ’			1
their living conditions become desperate when four of his other children come to visit at weekends and have to sleep in the living room , he said			2
the father of @entity36 ’s twins @entity20 , 24 , also stays four nights a week to help take care of his children			2
plea : the family says this four - bedroom house in @entity57 is too cramped and in poor condition none of the children who are of working age have jobs and mr @entity6 says he relies instead on state handouts like housing benefit and child tax credit to get by			1
he said : ‘ they are all in further education so they can get some qualifications and get good jobs			0
’ mr @entity6 , who claims to have nine further children – with whom he no longer has contact – added : ‘ i have 18 children with about ten women			1
i made some mistakes when i was younger but now i ’ll do anything to make my kids happy			0
‘ i hate to see the children have no space , no privacy			0
they have nowhere to do their homework so they are doing badly at school			0
’ - @entity6 , 64 ‘ getting a larger house would mean the world to us			1
it would mean we could get some peace and space			0
’ he said : ‘ i hate to see the children have no space , no privacy			0
they have nowhere to do their homework so they are doing badly at school			0
’ incredibly , mr @entity6 successfully complained to the @entity105 that the property , which he moved into in september 2011 , was too small			1
the watchdog agreed that one of the rooms was too tiny to be legally classed as a bedroom and ruled that mr @entity6 and his family had suffered a serious injustice as a result of failings by the @entity115			1
however the authority this week rejected the ombudsman ’s recommendation to pay the family £ 1,000 in compensation and bump them to the top of the housing register because it was against policy			0
members agreed a lesser amount of £ 250 was sufficient			0
councillors in @entity57 , @entity11 , have blasted mr @entity6 's request , claiming he is working the system to his own advantage			1
they have also rejected an ombudsman recommendation to pay him £ 1,000 compensation cllr @entity133 , the authority ’s cabinet member for housing , said mr @entity6 was ‘ operating the system to his own advantage ’			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i spent two years pursuing the case with the ombudsman and the council have ignored his report			1
‘ what is the point of an ombudsman if all the council do is ignore the findings ? they ’re basically sticking two fingers up at the whole process			0
’ however , mr @entity6 may yet get his dream home			2
the council says it does not have any six - bed homes available but is now considering buying a property big enough for them – or knocking two together to create one large house			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t care about the money , it is about the children and their human right to live			2
‘ it ’s an ongoing injustice but i will never give up on my children			0
