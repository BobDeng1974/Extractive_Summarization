while you were stuck in a traffic jam this @entity4 , the @entity0 of @entity1 continued their lifelong adventure across the world 's most beautiful locations , exclusive beach - side restaurants and star - studded parties			1
your average package holiday wo n't do for these youngsters who travel by private jet , sleep in presidential suites , wake up to scrambled eggs topped with truffles - and spend the rest of the day lounging on a luxurious yacht			1
@entity21 caught up with the world 's most extravagant 18 to 26 - year - olds who blew their cash in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 to name but a few cities before indulging in their stratospheric nightlife during @entity32			1
while the glamorous @entity35 sisters ' partied with @entity37 movie stars ' , self - made millionaire @entity33 continued to earn hundreds of thousands in minutes over online trades – even when he was sunbathing on the beach			1
and their message to the ' haters ' remains exactly the same : ' keep watching and enjoying			0
there is more to come			0
and no one does it quite like 18 - year - old @entity49 who ' constantly needs to be on the move ' and hates being in ' one place for two weeks '			1
in the last two months alone , the @entity87 has flown to @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , where he stayed in the famous @entity94 and skied every single day			0
but not before heading down to @entity95 to pick up a gold and brown document holder worth over £ 750 which has made several appearances on his opulent @entity1 account			1
the young investor says it 's not all fun , games and champagne - telling @entity21 : ' i would n't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while i travel i 'm not just sitting there and relaxing i 'm always networking or doing meetings			1
' but the concept that life is just one long fun trip that is constantly moving around definitely can describe my mindset			0
' 20 - year - old @entity35 and her sister @entity75 - who have been travelling back and forth between countries since they were young children - have become pretty used to the jet - setting lifestyle			1
@entity35 told @entity21 : ' we were just in @entity119 partying with our usual crowd and a lot of the same friends we hang with in @entity123 's			0
' we hung out at the @entity124 a lot with some friends who are actors we 'd prefer not to name , and went to some cool house parties in the hills			0
' but @entity33 who describes himself as a self - made man believes vacations should be spent relaxing with a beautiful girl			1
he told @entity21 : ' unlike the other kids i have had to work for the money so '' vacation '' is what i do			2
i ca n't just be away all the time because i 'm running a business but i still try to take time off as much as i can			0
' high - fliers : while most 20 - somethings would shack up in a local hostel , the jet - setting @entity35 sisters spend their vacations in @entity28 in the cafe scenic : and instead of hiring a cheap rental car for a cross-country road trip , @entity55 does the trip in his @entity151 before enjoying a beautiful panoramic view of @entity154 fjord wish you were here : 20 - year - old businesswoman @entity35 says she travels to promote her jewellery business as much as to have an adventure ca n't stop : @entity49 who ' constantly needs to be on the move ' used his mind - blowing trip to @entity162 in @entity163 to satisfy his need not to be ' one place for two weeks ' playtime : after spending time in @entity167 and @entity74 , @entity35 was delighted to be back in her ' playground ' of @entity169 unlike most 23 - year - olds who would book into a local hostel , he spent his time between the presidential suites of the @entity175 in @entity176 which set him back around £ 1,000 - a - night and the @entity178 in @entity179 which costs at least £ 500 - a - night			1
for @entity35 who grew up between @entity26 , @entity74 and @entity28 , travelling both a hobby and a necessity to promote her luxury jewellery company @entity183 around the world			1
she said : ' in the last few months i 've invested a lot into my new up and coming jewellery collection which involves rare sapphires , rubies , emeralds and diamonds			2
' and despite his own desire to unwind and relax , even @entity33 takes time away from the jet - ski and presidential suite to make a quick ' 209k profit '			1
the online trader 's @entity1 account is packed with huge piles of cash in different currencies and screenshots of his enormously lucrative trades			2
following a post of @entity33 asleep on a bed of money is a which suggests he made a staggering € 209,000 in a single day			2
he told @entity21 : ' money never sleeps and too much is never enough			0
i admit that i work a lot			2
i do n't like being lazy			0
i 'm very motivated and always wish to grow more and expend			0
' same is the case for globe - trotting @entity49 who told @entity21 : ' i would n't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while i travel i 'm not just sitting there and relaxing i 'm always networking or doing meetings ! ' @entity220 round : 26 - year - old @entity55 spends his time in the @entity222 at the glorious @entity223 with his friends soaking it in : @entity35 ( pictured ) , prefers to spend her time working on her tan on a west - @entity229 rooftop in @entity167 getting dirty : go - karting is a no - go for native new - yorker @entity49 who enjoys a spot of dirt racing in sunny @entity88 big money : self - made @entity179 businessman @entity33 ca n't bare to leave the office at home and manages to make a quick few hundred thousand while on vacation stunning : the @entity35 sisters @entity35 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) still manage to fit in a bike ride on @entity240 in between their many meetings despite the extreme levels of wealth he flaunts on his social media site , the 18 - year - old insists he is not out to make people jealous or infuriate the so - called ' haters ' - but to inspire people to reach higher			1
he said : ' to me i think anyone who takes @entity1 that serious is just being silly			2
my followers like luxury content and inspiration to do better and when i can give that content its great			0
' i hope that all my followers are happy with the content i bring to them and with every like and every comment i am motivated to keep it up			0
in addition , keep in mind there are certainly people out there who are crazier than me and spend much , much more and whenever i look at their pages i do n't get mad			0
@entity56 real - estate developer @entity55 once joked that he preferred his @entity269 over his exquisite @entity270 ' for the comfort '			0
he previously ran the marketing department in the family business and used his savings - and a little borrowed cash from the family - to buy his apartment in @entity154 , @entity56			0
he has been spending his spring break relaxing on his yacht in @entity25 harbour , enjoying @entity282 's beautiful open golf courses and road - tripping across @entity284 in his pristine @entity151			2
mile high : @entity49 even relaxes in style wearing his vintage @entity287 and expensive time piece in the back of a £ 2million personal jet chilling : @entity292 ' choice of hang - out spot after a yacht ride and a round of golf in @entity25 is n't too shabby either , as he stretches his legs in the @entity299 residence in @entity25 where apartments cost up to £ 3.2million @entity302 cocktail : what better way to relax and watch the sunset after a busy day of business meetings in @entity306 than dinner at the exclusive @entity309 restaurant rooftop cheers : and @entity33 who says he is ' unlike the other kids ' because he ' had to work for the money ' says there is nothing better than using your vacation to kick back and relax			1

@entity318 of @entity1 have been spending @entity32 in the most glamorous hotels in @entity28 , @entity26 and @entity176
they travel on £ 2million private jets , stay in £ 1,000 - a - night hotels , eat truffles with *breakfast* and lounge on yachts
but some , including 20 - year - old luxury jewellery designer @entity330 , have simply gotten used to jet - setting
others can not leave their work behind as @entity33 continues to make ' hundreds of thousands ' while on holiday
