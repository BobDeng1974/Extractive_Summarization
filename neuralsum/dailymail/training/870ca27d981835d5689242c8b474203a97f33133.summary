the former compound of a @entity2 couple who infamously held off federal agents there to arrest them in a 90 day standoff has hit the market for a very reasonable $ 250,000			1
the property is located in @entity8 on 100 acres and a features a large main house			2
the only problem is the somewhat high likelihood there are also unknown explosive booby traps hidden around the grounds			0
then , when it finally came time to turn themselves in on these charges following their trial , the two stockpiled weapons and held off federal agents for 90 days , gaining a rather large following of supporters in the process			1
at this same time , @entity19 noted that there were explosives hidden around the property to scare off trespassers			2
for this reason , federal agents wo n't even let interested buyers tour the property			1
strong stand : during the standoff , @entity62 posted no trespassing signs and legal claims outside the door no luck : the first auction bought in no interested buyers the house is being auctioned off , starting at $ 250,000 , with all money going towards the @entity73 massive tax bill			2
@entity20 is currently serving 37 years in prison and @entity19 for crimes relating to both their tax evasion and the subsequent standoff they had with federal agents			1
the two were finally arrested when two undercover officers pretending to be followers of their ideas and leanings were allowed in the house in october 2007			0
also on the market is the property that housed @entity20 's old dental practice , which is pricier at $ 507,500 and located in nearby @entity88			0
according to the @entity89 , @entity88 is owed $ 286,242 in back taxes for the dental property and @entity8 is owed $ 198,908 for the compound			0
not one person bid on the @entity95 property at the first auction .			0

the home and @entity19 and @entity20 who are serving time in prison for tax evasion is up for auction with the bid starting at $ 250,000
after being *convicted* of tax evasion the two *refused* to *surrender* , stockpiling weapons and holding off for federal agents for 90 days
at this time @entity19 *implied* that the entire property was surrounded by booby trap explosives to keep people away
now people buying the property ca n't tour the 100 acres of outdoor space as federal agents do n't know where these bombs could possibly be
