by @entity0 , political correspondent @entity1 was accused of resorting to a ‘ crass ’ class war by members of his own party last night over a political broadcast depicting @entity8 ministers as out - of - touch toffs who bully @entity11			1
the four - minute film , broadcast as part of @entity15 ’s campaign for this month ’s @entity17 parliament elections , makes no mention of either @entity17 or the party			1
instead , @entity15 has produced a parody of a 1950s b - movie , featuring actors playing @entity24 ministers with caricature posh voices receiving afternoon tea from servants around the @entity30 table			1
by the end of the film – a parody of the @entity37 1957 movie @entity38 – he is a tiny doll - like figure			2
the ad is thought to be the first product of @entity15 's new collaboration with @entity37 election guru @entity58 one @entity8 ‘ minister ’ suggests he should be hunted , before an actor playing @entity60 sets the @entity62 cat on him			1
the @entity37 - style attack ad is thought to be the first product of @entity15 ’s relationship with @entity37 elections guru @entity58			1
a @entity15 source said : ‘ it was aimed at younger people who do n’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective			2
’ party election campaign co-ordinator @entity73 said the film was ‘ a bit of fun ’ but made a ‘ serious point ’			2
but critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition			2
some mps said it recalled the 2008 @entity87 by - election when an attempt to paint @entity8 candidate @entity90 as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat			1
one former minister described the film as ‘ crass ’			0
he added : ‘ we tried waging class war in @entity97			0
it failed then and it will fail now			0
' the trouble is the kids in the leader ’s team are probably too young to remember that			0
’ another @entity15 mp said the broadcast was ‘ depressing ’ , adding : ‘ where was the positive vision to attract swing voters ? ’ @entity109 , editor of the influential grassroots website @entity111 , said the film lacked a ‘ positive agenda ’			0
left - wing @entity115 columnist @entity114 said it was ‘ a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away ’			0
the advert takes place around the @entity30 table as ' posh ' @entity8 lead by an actor playing @entity60 force @entity11 to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees as @entity11 abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit			1
however @entity15 critics say the ad does n't mention @entity17 or their party mr @entity11 tried to laugh off the film ’s efforts to ridicule him			1
he said : ‘ they spent money on this ? particularly from @entity1 who is the sort of missing man in @entity141 politics			0
‘ he has n’t breathed a word about the issue we ’re supposed to be debating , which is whether we ’re in or out of @entity17			0
