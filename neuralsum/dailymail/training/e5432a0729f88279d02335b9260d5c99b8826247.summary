by @entity0 there 's a bitter battle being fought on the @entity3 between retail titans @entity5 and @entity6			1
what are they fighting over ? well , that would be you , mrs @entity11			1
it seems that every move @entity5 makes , @entity6 quickly copies it			1
take the surprising similarities between @entity6 's spring / summer own - brand catalogue for the industry , released late last month , and @entity5 's , which came out in november			1
the pictures of models in little stripy dresses , floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable			1
@entity23 put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist @entity27 , founder of fashion consultancy company @entity28 , to give her verdict ... @entity6 : @entity30 by @entity32 wide - leg trousers , £ 99 , and silk jacket , £ 140 @entity5 : jacket , £ 69 , and @entity5 trousers , £ 55 wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers , which are an on - trend look this season			1
the @entity6 print is lovely			1
the @entity32 trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire @entity6 collection			1
yes , they 're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes , but definitely worth it			1
you could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work			1
and thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg , you could dress them up for a sexier look at night			1
these trousers would be flattering whatever your size			1
sadly , @entity5 misses the mark			1
its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you 'd sell in a @entity66 range , not put in a spring collection			1
i 'm not a fan of the trousers either , particularly after seeing the excellent @entity6 version			1
these are creased even on the hanger and they 're cut very straight at the hip , which is going to be a problem for pear - shaped women			1
one good thing is that they 're properly lined , so at least your knickers wo n't show through the white fabric			1
personally , i 'd spend the extra money and buy the @entity85 trousers at @entity6			1
winner : @entity6 @entity6 : @entity88 jumper , £ 69 , and collection pink trousers , £ 59 @entity5 : @entity91 jumper , £ 65 , and @entity5 pink trousers , £ 59 both retailers have gone for acid brights , with varying degrees of success			1
the @entity6 sweater is dull and dated - it 's limp on the hanger , so it 's going to look awful after a bit of wear			1
the rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap			1
on the other hand , the trousers are well - cut , with ample room round the bottom			1
they 've designed them with women 's curves in mind			1
knitwear is one of @entity5 's strong suits and this jumper is lovely			1
the longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive			2
the cashmere is much heavier than the @entity6 version , despite the fact they 're almost the same price			2
however , the trousers , are not good			2
the crotch is too low and there 's too much fabric in the waistband			2
and why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side ? winner : @entity5 for cashmere , @entity6 for trousers @entity6 : dress , £ 89 @entity5 : @entity138 and ivory dress , £ 35 the @entity6 dress would suit any age			2
it 's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape			2
the nautical look is n't overdone ( no sailor collars or brass buttons ) , so it could work in the office or at a wedding			2
the fabric is a little bit retro , which again will appeal to an older woman			2
nautical stripes are n't a particular trend for 2014 , but they 're a spring / summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and i think @entity6 have executed this look well			2
oh dear - then we come to @entity5			2
i wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this ? it 's too floppy and girly to wear to work , but too prim to be sexy			2
the scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively , particularly at the seams			2
yes , it 's cheap , but i just ca n't see many people looking good in it			0
winner : @entity6 @entity6 : collection white dress , £ 79 , @entity174 @entity5 : per @entity5 dress with leather panels , £ 199 , marksandspencer.com at first glance , these dresses are similar - until you put them on			0
though a fitted , white dress is n't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim , @entity6 has made their cotton version as flattering as possible			0
the waist seam curves upwards slightly , drawing the eye away from the tummy			0
and the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette			0
then there 's the @entity5 version , which i really do n't like			0
yes , they 've picked fashion - forward snakeskin-esque fabric ( which feels rather cheap to me ) , but it 's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps			0
then there 's that high neckline , which makes even our model look broad - shouldered			0
i 'm surprised this is from @entity5 , which is where i often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20			0
i ca n't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress , or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it			0
and the final blow is that it 's more than double the price of @entity6 's version			0
my advice is to steer clear			0
winner : @entity6 @entity6 : floral print top , £ 49 , and trousers , £ 59 @entity5 : autograph floral top , £ 65 , and trousers , £ 75 the @entity6 shirt is just about ok if you want to get this on - trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong , but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team ? look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it 's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line			0
it 's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person			0
if i were a betting woman , i 'd say these will be on the sale rail before long			0
i 'm also not convinced by the @entity5 boxy floral top			0
i do n't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy			0
but the @entity5 trousers are brilliant			0
despite being a critic of the store 's normal range , there 's often much better tailoring in the autograph collection than in @entity5			0
the @entity5 designers have really thought about this print			0
it 's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person , but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider			0
i 'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse			0
the designers have made a very good job of this fashion - forward look			0
winner : @entity5 pictures : l + @entity271 & make - up : @entity273 using @entity274 and @entity275 : @entity276 at milk management www.dressme.biz			0
