by @entity0 it is a feat which would put @entity2 to shame			0
a bright green bus with 600,000 miles on the clock has been saved from the scrapyard - and turned into a holiday cottage			1
the 31 - year - old double decker boasts two double bedrooms , carpets , sofas , a kitchen , idyllic country views and even a log - burning stove in a creation reminiscent of the 1963 hit film @entity16			1
not your average campervan : @entity20 @entity19 , 42 , bought this bright green double decker bus on @entity22 for £ 4,500 and and turned it into a holiday let with a kitchen , bedrooms and even a log burner summer holiday : @entity27 entered service in 1982 and was almost sent for scrap			1
its owner now lets it out to up to six people at a campsite in @entity34 , @entity35 - with the remains of the seats still intact cosy : the bedrooms on the top deck swap sticky floors for carpets and include a vintage lemonade advert in the film @entity2 played a bus mechanic who turned an iconic red @entity48 double decker into a touring campervan and drove it across @entity50			1
the @entity52 metrobus was the same sickly green colour as it is now when carpenter @entity19 , 42 , bought it on @entity22 for £ 4,500			1
one of more than 4,000 buses of its type , it entered service in 1982 with route number 2464 and spent almost 30 years on the streets of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			2
it clocked up 600,000 miles - almost the distance to the moon and back			1
mr @entity19 spent six months full - time on the project and scoured homeware shops for matching cushions and paint , spending more than £ 10,000			2
he said : ' i saw an old double decker rotting in a farmer 's field while driving through the countryside last @entity78			0
by the time i was home i had already planned in my head how it could be done			0
unusual : most buses today have little room for pushchairs , but this one has found space for a log - burning stove watching the world go by : the £ 15,000 project includes an original seat on the top deck with idyllic views parts of the 31 - year - old bus could be mistaken for a 1970s caravan - but it is far more sprawling than that @entity100 : the double and bunk beds on the top deck call to mind the carriage of an old - fashioned sleeper train mr @entity19 spent £ 10,000 fitting out the bus - and finding green furnishings to match the paint ' i had a look on @entity22 and found that double deckers were not as expensive as i would have thought , so bought one for £ 4,500			1
' i quite simply wanted to give people the experience of staying something like this , and i think people are interested because it 's the type of bus they may have taken to school			2
' he named it the @entity122 and lets it out starting at £ 150 a night at a rural campsite in @entity34 , @entity35			1
with an extra pair of bunk beds - at the back of the top deck for the naughty children - the unique ' cottage ' sleeps up to six people			2
the carpenter added : ' it was hard to do and it took up all my time for over six months			0
' i ran out of money and had to take a carpentry job to raise more cash which put more pressure on the deadline			0
' if i 'd have known just how hard it was going to be i probably would have thought twice before taking it on , but i had blind enthusiasm , and thank @entity142 i did			0
' the whole project is one massive recycling exercise			0
the bus was coming to the end of its working life and would have been scrapped			0
but i saved it from a horrible death and turned it into something amazing '			0
back row boys : the holiday let 's green sofas give new meaning to hanging around at the rear of the bus instead of having to inch past passengers with their shopping , @entity19 's punters see vintage advertisements no paraffin stove here : the bus goes one better than a campervan and includes a full - scale oven for guests it may seem unorthodox , but the bus 's size gives it a natural advantage over other modes of camping tickets please ! parts of the bus which were installed when it entered service in @entity62 in 1982 are still intact hold tight : the stairs to the upper deck have been decorated with a collage of photos of the sea mr @entity19 spent £ 15,000 on the project but wanted to keep it like a bus which people took to school on the buses : the bus calls to mind @entity2 's 1963 hit film @entity16			1
he played a mechanic who transformed a @entity48 double decker into a holiday campervan and drove it across @entity50 to @entity195 the @entity122 now lives on a campsite in @entity34 , @entity35			1
its creator , carpenter @entity197 , 42 , said : ' the whole project is one massive recycling exercise			2
i saved it from a horrible death '			0
