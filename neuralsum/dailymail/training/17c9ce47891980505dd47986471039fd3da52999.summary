even while recovering from the removal of a cyst from his foot last month , @entity0 was so desperate to be on a tennis court that his joint coach , @entity5 , had to improvise			2
‘ he was sitting on a collapsible chair on the court because he could n’t run and i was feeding him balls to hit for an hour , ’ recalled @entity5 after his charge had beaten @entity7 to make tonight ’s @entity9 final			1
such dedication is why 24 - year - old @entity14 is poised to become a superstar of @entity17 sport , and why he has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of @entity19			1
something special : @entity0 , 24 , has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of @entity19 preparation : @entity0 , the @entity22 no 10 seed , practices in @entity24 ahead of the @entity9 final ten years after arriving as a homesick boy at the renowned @entity28 / @entity27 in @entity29 , he is in his first @entity31 final and will start as favourite against the comparatively towering @entity33			1
it is the first @entity31 men ’s final in nearly nine years not to feature one of the so - called ‘ @entity37 ’ of @entity7 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
but neither of the two surprise finalists would have been top of the list to depose the established order			0
@entity33 , 25 , has spent most of his career on the periphery of the top 10 , while the fear around @entity0 , the son of an engineer and a piano teacher , is that he is not physically equipped to make the very top			1
at 5ft 10in and weighing less than 11 stone his body has often failed to cope with the physical aspect of the modern game , although his natural talent has never been in question			0
he has always possessed an outstanding backhand and won his first @entity60 title at @entity61 as an 18 - year - old			1
subsequently the questions have not just surrounded his physique but his mentality , particularly when it came to facing the best players			0
over the past week he has answered all of that with consecutive five - set wins over @entity70 and @entity71 , followed by saturday ’s semi-final against @entity7 , who he outlasted over four sets in brutal heat and humidity			1
coming of age : @entity0 's beaten @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity7 en route to the final @entity79 , who formed part of his coaching set - up in 2011 , describes him as ‘ very quiet and shy ’			1
his faltering mastery of @entity83 may have been a part of that , and @entity79 would email him tactical instructions for matches , rather than talk to him			0
the missing ingredient appears to have been the addition of @entity91 winner @entity90 to his team , part of the trend set by @entity40 when he hired @entity95			2
like @entity95 , @entity90 has managed to get through to his charge in a way that did not happen before			0
‘ we get on great , ’ said @entity90			0
‘ with myself being @entity101 and @entity102 there are cultural differences but also similarities because we are both @entity17			2
if we are going out to eat we do n’t have to say “ do you want @entity17 food ? ” it has been easy for us to adapt to one another			2
’ @entity0 missed several tournaments last month due to the cyst , but @entity90 believes that this has proved to be a blessing in disguise			2
‘ it was n’t the best preparation but after three weeks off he arrived fresh and hungry			0
some guys have a great summer but by the time the @entity9 comes around they are tired			0
support network : @entity0 has shone since @entity90 took over as his coach ‘ i told him if he could get past the first two rounds anything could happen			0
i keep reminding him he has beaten everyone here , and not to be satisfied with what he has achieved already			0
’ @entity90 was a terrific fighter with lightning foot speed			0
@entity0 is also quick but his natural timing gives him more potent weapons than his coach ever had , despite his relative lack of size			0
it has led him to become easily the best player ever from @entity22 , which has always produced good female players but struggled much more on the men ’s side			1
their previous best of the modern era was @entity138 in the nineties , who is perhaps best remembered for suffering a spectacular bout of cramp that led to the rules being changed about on - court treatment			0
@entity0 would become the first @entity22 man to win a tennis major , and the commercial possibilities of that would be almost limitless			2
either way , tennis is going to get its least predictable men ’s @entity31 champion since @entity154 upset @entity38 at @entity155 five years ago			1
@entity38 was phlegmatic after his straight - sets defeat by the hugely impressive @entity33 , but this was a golden opportunity missed for him to add to his 17 @entity31			1
@entity0 has a 5 - 2 record over @entity33 and has beaten him twice this year			1
yet the @entity160 has improved significantly and is an outstanding mover for his height , meaning that the @entity22 can only be considered a marginal favourite			0
no pressure : although towering over his opponent , @entity33 goes into the final as the underdog giant : 6ft 6in @entity33 beat @entity38 in straight sets to win his place in the final @entity0 first round v @entity172 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 second round v @entity174 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , retired third round v @entity176 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 fourth round v ( 5 ) @entity70 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 quarter - final v ( 3 ) @entity71 3 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 4 semi-final v @entity7 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 3 @entity33 1st round v @entity181 6 - 3 , 3 - 1 retired 2nd round v @entity183 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 3rd round v ( 18 ) @entity186 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 4th round v ( 26 ) @entity188 5 - 7 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 quarter - final v ( 6 ) @entity189 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 ( 6 - 4 ) semi-final v ( 2 ) @entity38 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 @entity192 : monday , september 8 @entity193 , @entity194			1
