the @entity1 subway is cramped with people , but a new study shows that the underground system may be much more crowded than we realized			2
scientists from @entity7 have unveiled their findings after 18 months swabbing turnstiles , ticket kiosks , railings and benches for dna on the world 's largest transport system			1
they found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders , including bubonic plague , dysentery and meningitis			1
zoom in on the map to find out which subways stations have the most bacteria ... principal investigator dr @entity27 and his team released findings from their ' @entity31 ' study on thursday , a map of all the microorganisms and dna present on surfaces in the @entity1 subway			1
the study , which used a super computer to study more than 10 billion biomedical fragments , was apparently inspired by dr @entity27 seeing his daughter , then in preschool , sticking toys in her mouth in 2010			1
scientists and volunteers started the project in 2013 and found 637 known bacterial , viral , fungal and animal species when swabbing the spaces between commuters and street musicians and logging the data in real time with a mobile app. most of the bacteria the group found were harmless , though nearly half ( 48 per cent ) of the @entity13 found matched no known organisms , according to the published study at @entity61			2

the red areas show the areas with the most bacteria , according to their findings , while the cooler colours reveal less bacteria pictured are some of the most popular stations in @entity1 , along with a common type of bacteria found in the area			2
many are associated with different diseases such as food poisoning and infections the @entity1 subway system is famous for being grimy - but commuters may not have realised just how much until now			2
traces of anthrax and the bubonic plague have been found in central areas ( pictured ) @entity86 linked to diseases including bubonic plague and staph infections ( left ) are found at a number of stations around the city , along with dysentery and meningitis the mysterious finding ' underscores the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas , ' project leader @entity95 said			1
researchers also saw 67 different bacteria species associated with diseases on the subway 's surfaces in about 12 per cent of their samples , though bacteria in general made up nearly 47 per cent			0
some bacteria associated with ailments such as food poisoning are found at nearly half of the 466 open stations shared by germs , riders and rats			1
thankfully , more serious bacteria are less common			0
the most diverse station was the g train 's @entity118 stop in @entity120 , with 95 different bacteria researchers also saw 67 different bacteria species associated with diseases on the subway 's surfaces in about 12 per cent of their samples , though bacteria in general made up nearly 47 per cent			0
pictured are the hotspots the microbes associated with dysentery was only found at three stations , as was the bacteria that causes bubonic plague			1
scientists , who include researchers from six @entity1 medical centers and other institutions around the world , said that the plague microbes were shown not to be alive			2
the @entity1 @entity136 disputed the finding of plague on the subway , according to the @entity140			2
the most diverse station was the g train 's @entity118 stop in @entity120 , with 95 different bacteria groups			0
@entity145 station , which was submerged and temporarily closed after @entity146 in 2012 , showed unique sets of bacteria normally found in marine environments			0
dr @entity27 said that someone who licks a subway pole ( held above by former mayor @entity152 ) would ' probably be fine ' scientists said that most of the harmful bacteria are found in low quantities and good or neutral bacteria may be out - competing them			1
bubonic plague found at 3 stations dysentery 3 stations @entity160 56 stations food poisoning 215 stations meningitis 9 stations @entity166 infections 66 stations tetanus 9 stations city dwellers ' immune systems are also equipped to handle all the microbes thrown at them during the typical day			1
' you would n't want to lick all the poles , even though you 'd probably be fine , ' dr @entity27 said			1
the principal investigator advocated exposing young children to germs when speaking at the @entity178 , according to @entity179			0
' the best thing to do with newborns is roll them like sushi on the subway ground , ' he said			0
researchers also mapped microorganisms that were not bacteria , including those that likely came from popular @entity1 foodstuffs such as @entity191 mozzarella and kimchi			0
215 stations in @entity1 had traces of bacteria associated with food poisoning such as salmonella ( pictured ) the most common dna besides bacteria came from insects , plant matter and humans , who represented 0.2 per cent of the material collected			1
the @entity31 study hopes to eventually create a ' weather map ' or microscopic organisms to be able to warn people about potential disease outbreaks			0
scientists believe studying how microbes move around urban environments will help them keep track of long - term health trends			0
other researchers in 14 states are undertaking similar projects to map the microbes in transit systems			0
subway studies are also underway in @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224			0

dr @entity27 and his *colleagues* swabbed subway system for 18 months
scientists mapped 466 stations and found 15,000 types of microbes
germs associated with bubonic plague and dysentery found at 3 stations
nearly half of dna collected did not match any known organisms
most common *non-bacteria* dna found was from bugs , plants and humans
