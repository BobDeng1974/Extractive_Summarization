to the trained eye , this ' penguin ' is clearly a machine - but that has n't stopped it fooling and infiltrating a large group of notoriously shy emperor penguins			1
biologists are using the penguin rover to approach the group and learn more about their feeding habits , health , and interactions			2
and it is so convincing , penguins in the group were spotted talking to it , as if it was a potential mate for their chicks			0
the device was designed to snuggle up to shy penguins and track their health			1
the baby penguin robotic spy lets scientists check heart rate , stress levels and other penguin parameters emperor penguins are difficult to study because they are shy and easily intimidated			1
when researchers approach , these penguins typically back away and the stress of the encounter causes their heart rates to increase			2
emperors are the largest species of penguins , and an average bird grows to almost 4ft ( 1.1 metres ) tall			0
like all penguins , the animals ca n't fly			0
emperors live on the @entity45 ice and have developed so - called cooperative behaviours to handle the harsh winds and low temperatures			1
for example , the birds huddle together to protect themselves from the wind and conserve energy			0
individuals take turns moving into the centre of the group , before moving to the outside when it has warmed up			0
females lay a single egg before leaving the male to look after it as she goes hunting			0
at sea , emperor penguins can dive to 1,850 feet ( 565 meters ) for krill and other fish - and can stay underwater for more than 20 minutes			2
mothers can be away for up to two months , and when they return they regurgitate the food into the newly hatched chicks ' mouths			0
the males then go hunting			0
to monitor the birds ' health , without causing them unnecessary stress , a group of scientists and filmmakers , led by @entity79 from the @entity80 in @entity81 , created the remote - controlled rover , disguised as a chick			1
the penguins themselves were fitted with heart - rate loggers			2
the experiment took place in @entity93 , @entity45 - the same place where the 2005 documentary ' @entity96 ' was filmed			1
after sending the rover into the group , researchers watched from a distance of 650 feet ( 198 metres ) away			2
the first disguised version of the rover , made of fiberglass , scared the real birds , professor @entity79 said			2
in total , the researchers experimented with five more versions of the rover before finding a design that worked			1
the rover is covered in grey fur , has black arms and a black - and - white painted face , plus a black beak			1
it is fitted with cameras and sensors that connect to the researchers ' computers			0
the penguins did n't scamper away and even sang to it with ' a very special song like a trumpet , ' professor @entity79 said			0
professor @entity79 suggested that the adult penguins were trying to find a mate for their chicks and they were listening for a response , but researchers did n't program the rover to make a sound			1

the study suggested that the adult penguins were trying to find a mate for their chicks and they were listening for a response , but researchers did n't program the rover to make a sound researcher @entity152 ( pictured ) tried five versions of robotic penguins during tests ' they were very disappointed when there was no answer , ' he said			1
' next time we will have a rover playing songs			0
' at other times , the rover crowded in with a group of chicks , acting as ' a spy in the huddle , ' professor @entity79 continued			0
researchers worry that just by coming close to some shy animals they change their behavior and can taint the results of their studies			0
a number of rovers are being used , and a similar model was seen in the @entity178 series @entity179 in the huddle			0
professor @entity79 also used a rover without any animal disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals , because those animals do n't flee strangers			1
the king penguins attacked the small rover with their beaks , unless it stayed still , but even that allowed the device to get close enough to get readings			1
the large elephant seals did n't budge when the rover zipped by and around them			1
in the future , the researchers plan to use a more autonomous robot to spy on the emperor penguins			2
the idea is to use devices on the rover to read signals from radio tags on the birds			0
the study is published in the journal @entity205			0
experts also used a rover without any disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals			1
the undisguised rover is shown approaching an incubating king penguin ( top left ) , that has been fitted with a heart rate ( @entity214 ) logger			2
@entity215 ( b ) shows the increase in heart rate when the rover , and the human , approaches the birds			0

scientists created a remote - controlled rover disguised as a penguin chick
device is designed to snuggle up to shy penguins in @entity93 , @entity45
in total , the researchers experimented with five designs of the rover
the finished design is covered in grey fur , has black arms and a black - and - white painted face , plus a black beak
researchers also used the rover to spy on king penguins and elephant seals
