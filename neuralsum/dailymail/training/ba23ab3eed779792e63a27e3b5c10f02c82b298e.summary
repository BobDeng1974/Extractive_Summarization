three - quarters said rebel mps were right to defy his three - line whip			2
mr @entity48 admitted yesterday that he must ‘ work harder ’ to persuade his backbenchers he is on their side			2

‘ the prime minister says now is not the time to talk about @entity71 because of the need to fix the economy			0
but the public see the two things going hand in hand - we can not fix the economy until we get out of the claws of @entity5 , which is bleeding us dry			1

’ in a sign of the @entity97 tensions over the issue , deputy prime minister @entity37 yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from @entity5			1
‘ that simply is n’t on the cards , ’ he said			0
‘ it would n’t work , it ’s not possible			0

not moving fast enough ? mr @entity48 , pictured speaking with @entity112 chancellor @entity111 , has ordered every @entity61 department to draw up a list of powers to be grabbed back from @entity5 @entity29 @entity116 said the time had come for the prime minister to face down his @entity97 partners			1
‘ the fact that people are coming to see the prime minister as out of touch should worry him			0
' there is always a danger that prime ministers become detached from what the public think			0
but in this case the real problem is that we are hogtied by the @entity109			0
‘ we can not have a party that commands only eight per cent support in the polls having a veto on bringing powers back from @entity5			1
’ the poll findings came as it emerged that mr @entity48 has ordered ‘ urgent ’ work to draw up a comprehensive blueprint that he can take to @entity5 if eurozone countries seek a major change in the treaties which govern the @entity9			1

coalition tensions : deputy prime minister @entity37 yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from @entity5 the prime minister opened a two - front war on @entity5 yesterday , launching a broadside at the @entity158 for making ‘ daily attacks ’ on the @entity160			1
he said work has begun to examine the balance of powers between @entity164 and @entity5 - a pledge contained in the coalition agreement			1
senior sources say the work on repatriation of powers has gone much wider than previously admitted			2
ministers have previously conceded only that employment laws and fisheries policy are under the spotlight			0
the project being coordinated by the @entity176 includes every single government department			0
they have all been asked to draw up details of the ‘ risks and opportunities that could arise if there is a renegotiation of treaties ’			0
the blueprint will also cover the @entity9 ’s @entity186 , which enshrines much of the @entity187 - which has led the courts to make controversial rulings in favour of foreign prisoners in deportation cases			1
senior officials expect there to be a minor revision of the treaties in december - but they believe making major demands at that point would endanger the @entity199 and the @entity1 economy with it			1
that is bound to disappoint @entity29 eurosceptics and the public			2
but senior sources say a major treaty revision will be necessary as early as next year , with a full - blown inter-governmental conference to draw up a new set of rules to recognise the changed relationship between those inside and outside the eurozone			2

the @entity105 survey for the @entity12 has revealed a growing divide between the sexes , with 54 per cent of men saying that mr @entity48 is doing a good job			0

the survey follows a poll earlier in the month which found that one in four voters believe mr @entity48 ’s attitude to women is ‘ sexist ’			2
@entity29 strategists are concerned that the @entity97 ’s cuts are seen as particularly harmful to women , with recent figures showing that the number of unemployed women has reached a million			2

a leaked report of the @entity253 report , commissioned by the pm , is said to suggest that mr @entity48 scale back on his pledges to extend flexible working rights			0
concerns over @entity64 ’ loss of female support has prompted mr @entity48 to go on a charm offensive in recent weeks			0
