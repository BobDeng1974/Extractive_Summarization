by @entity0 last updated at 10:54 pm on 28th august 2011 some children kick up a big tantrum when they ’re refused toys or receive the wrong type of birthday card - but it does n’t usually end up like this			0
@entity8 , who raised @entity9 , now 23 , and @entity10 , now 20 , in a $ 1.5million home in @entity12 , was sued by her own children			1

screaming : @entity8 , who raised @entity9 , now 23 , and @entity10 , now 20 , has been sued by her own children for ' bad mothering ' ( file picture ) they alleged @entity8 failed to take @entity10 to a car show and threatened @entity9 with phoning police if he did not buckle his seatbelt			1
the children claim she ‘ haggled ’ over dress prices and called at midnight to tell @entity10 to come home from a party , reported the @entity29			2
but after two years of battle an appeals court has dismissed the ‘ emotional distress ’ case , ruling @entity8 's conduct was not ‘ extreme or outrageous ’			1
a positive ruling ‘ could potentially open the floodgates to subject family childrearing ( to ) excessive judicial scrutiny and interference , ’ it said			0

the card said : ‘ son i got you this birthday card because it ’s just like you ... different from all the rest ! ’ ' it would be laughable that these children of privilege would sue their mother for emotional distress , if the consequences were not so deadly serious ' @entity67 , @entity8 ’s lawyer @entity8 ’s attorney @entity67 complained of her ex-husband trying to seek ‘ ultimate revenge ’ of her children , accusing her of ‘ being an inadequate mother ’			1

‘ ( the children ) do not view their ( lawsuit ) as an attack on mothering , but rather on accountability , ’ the children ’s father mr @entity16 wrote			0
