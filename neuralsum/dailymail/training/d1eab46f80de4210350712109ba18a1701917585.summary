by @entity0 with the swollen @entity1 already flooding homes , and thousands more at risk this week might not have been the best time to launch plans for outdoor swimming pools along the river			1
thousands of homes have either already flooded or are at risk of doing so , with the @entity1 bursting its banks in both @entity11 and @entity12			1
and yet developers have chosen this week to launch their scheme for public swimming areas along the river in @entity17			1
fancy a dip : this scheme to build swimming pools in the @entity1 was launched in the same week that hundreds of homes were flooded by the river location : this pool would be situated at @entity24 , close to a proposed super sewer vent architects studio @entity29 , the designers behind the scheme say the 25metre pools , would offer users a place to exercise , but would also provide a ' habitat for fish , birds and a wide range of flora			1
' ' the improvements in water quality open the possibility for once again swimming in the tidal @entity1 , ' said @entity42 - @entity41			1
' these proposals look to re-establish this intimate and playful link between @entity45 and the historic lifeblood of the city			0
@entity45 have an opportunity to reclaim ownership of their largest outdoor public space			0
' the fixed pools would be split across two levels and sit on a concrete slab suspended on the steel frame , while the second adjoining floating structure would be free to rise and fall with the tide			0
plans : the fixed pools would be split across two levels and sit on a concrete slab suspended on the steel frame , while the second adjoining floating structure would be free to rise and fall with the tide natural : the designers behind the scheme say the 25metre pools would offer users a place to exercise , but would also provide a ' habitat for fish , birds and a wide range of flora ' as the supporting structure weathers , the designers hope it would be colonised by algae , ferns and saline plants such as sea beet and sea aster , while the pool itself would also be home to salt marsh species such as rushes and water plantains			2
over the next 10 years @entity86 is planning major improvements to the @entity17 sewer system , including so - called new super sewers			1
the current system , designed by sir @entity91 , opened in 1865 and 150 years later the sewers are running at full capacity			0
in 2012 , 57 combined sewer overflows discharged 39 million tonnes of sewage into the @entity1			2
weathered : as the supporting structure weathers , the designers hope it would be colonised by algae , ferns and saline plants such as sea beet and sea aster the designers behind the scheme have earmarked the @entity104 for the sites of the proposed @entity107 vents : @entity108 in the east of the city and @entity24 in central @entity17			1
' our scheme does n’t rely on the @entity107 it relies on the government taking action and commissioning a clean - up programme for the @entity1 as the ( existing ) @entity117 sewers are near capacity , ' said mr @entity119			2
he added : ' the @entity24 site was chosen for both the @entity107 vent but also because of its proximity to both the @entity123 and @entity17 ’s cultural quarter ( @entity125 , @entity126 etc )			2
i love places in cities that are not defined by one profession / type ; where @entity123 workers , tourists , the arts , sport and leisure are all mixed up			0
funding : the designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme , as with a similar project in @entity141 , as well as looking for individual investors ' we are still meeting lots of people in connection to the proposals to understand where we will go from here			0
we ’ve had such a positive response it has renewed momentum			0
' asked about the project being launched in the same week that much of the @entity1 flooded mr @entity119 said that the flooding highlighted the need for action to be taken on the current sewer system serving @entity17			1
' this is one of many major infrastructure projects that need to occur to look after our beloved city , ' he said			0
the designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme , as with a similar project in @entity141 , as well as looking for individual investors			0
the project is a collaboration between @entity166 , engineers @entity168 and @entity169 , who were chosen to conceive visions for the @entity1 as part of @entity173 ’s programme ‘ @entity17 as it could be now ’ project			1
the teams were encouraged to explore ideas that increased interaction with the waterway and raised awareness of this important artery running through the capital .			0

architects have submitted plans to build swimming pools in central @entity17
@entity187 launched as hundreds of homes are flooded by the swollen @entity1
the 25m pools would be located at vents for proposed super sewers
