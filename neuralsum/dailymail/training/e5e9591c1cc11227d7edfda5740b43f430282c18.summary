with his chiselled features , piercing blue eyes and a surname that opened just about any door in @entity5 , @entity0 must have been all but irresistible to the women he tried to seduce			0
the fact he was married with children seems to have given neither him nor his many lovers pause for thought			0
yet when he had bedded yet another woman , he would go home and write in a diary that the liaison constituted yet another ‘ mugging ’ — of him , not his companion			1
he also wrote that if he went a day without adultery it was a ‘ victory ’			1
a 2001 diary belonging to @entity20 , pictured with late wife @entity21 , has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child unfortunately , there were far too few days when his ‘ lust demons ’ , as he called them , did not win their battle			1
in the extraordinary diary discovered by his wife shortly before she committed suicide in grief over the break - up of their marriage , the son of @entity37 — and the nephew of @entity39 — recorded serial philandering which puts even the priapic ways of his presidential uncle in the shade			1
when challenged by a journalist who had been handed the bombshell diary , @entity20 , a 59 - year - old former heroin addict , initially insisted it did not exist , but yesterday belatedly admitted it was indeed his			1
across 398 pages , in puerile detail , the thick , red journal records his every conquest during the year 2001 — and in the process becomes the latest shameful chapter in the history of @entity5 ’s most venerated yet most dysfunctional family			2
bad example : ( from left ) @entity64 , @entity37 and @entity67 @entity20 , pictured at his wife @entity21 's graveside in 2012 with their children , wrote in his 2001 diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her part self - flagellating @entity78 mea culpa , and part smutty schoolboy boasting , the diary includes a scorecard in which he recorded the names of all the women he slept with , alongside a number between one and ten denoting how far he went with each			1
the numbers corresponded to sexual acts , with ten denoting intercourse			0
at the back of the diary , in the section marked ‘ cash accounts ’ , @entity20 noted the names of all 37 women with whom he cheated on his wife that year — 16 of whom got tens			1
they reportedly include a lawyer , a doctor , an environmental activist and the wife of a famous actor			0
the shocking details were revealed by the @entity103 , which has seen the @entity105 timing of his adultery was particularly awful			0
not only did @entity21 give birth to their fourth child in july of that year , but many of his adulterous liaisons came at a time when the rest of @entity5 was deeply traumatised by the september 11 attacks			0
it seems even that horror was not enough to quash his addiction to sex , which led @entity20 — on november 13 , 2001 , his diary reveals — to seduce three women in a single day , although only one was a ‘ ten ’			1
@entity124 with his late wife @entity20 , left , in 2008 and , right , with girlfriend @entity125 in 2011 on the same day , he mustered enough energy to squeeze in a charity fundraising dinner at a @entity129 hotel , where he sat next to the paralysed @entity132 star @entity131			0
that month alone , as @entity20 travelled around the @entity5 for his work as an environmental campaigner , he listed one woman ’s name on 22 different days			1
in may , he hosted a dinner for @entity138 in @entity139 , but ‘ got mugged on my way home ’ — noting the woman ’s name , and the fact she inflicted a ten on him			1
‘ i ’ve got to do better , ’ he added , as though confessing to a priest			1
sometimes he managed to resist			0
‘ i narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team [ two women ] , ’ he related in a february diary entry			1
‘ it was tempting , but i prayed and @entity150 gave me the strength to say no. ’ serial adultery is a weakness among the testosterone - fuelled male @entity154			1
patriarch @entity156 showed the way with his open affair with actress @entity159 , reportedly telling his sons — @entity64 , @entity37 and @entity161 — to get ‘ laid as often as possible ’			1
it seems the infidelity gene has been inherited in a third generation			0
even to his diary , @entity166 could n’t be completely honest			1
despite @entity37 ’s own track record , his son comically insists he was ashamed by what his father might think of his own philandering			2
and he makes clear in the book that he is one of many younger @entity154 who have had trouble living up to the family ’s gilded ‘ @entity177 ’ reputation			1
after his father was assassinated in 1968 , @entity166 ‘ struggled to be a grown up ’ , he told his @entity178 went on : ‘ i felt he was watching me from @entity180			1
every time i was afflicted with sexual thoughts , i felt a failure			0
i began to lie , to make up a character who was the hero i wished i was			0
’ since when was having ‘ sexual thoughts ’ a sign of failure in the thrusting @entity20 family ? @entity20 spent 30 days in a @entity192 jail alongside rev. @entity193 in july 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a @entity195 training facility			1
but the @entity197 - @entity5 clan has always been able to hide its transgressions behind its supposedly staunch @entity78 , and @entity166 himself used @entity201 imagery to describe his own womanising			1
‘ despite the desperate things happening in the world , my life is			2
great , ’ he wrote on november 5 , 2001			2
‘ so i ’ve been looking for ways to screw it up			2
i ’m like @entity208 , and i can have everything but the fruit			0
but the fruit is all i want			0
’ on another occasion , he told himself to be ‘ humble like a monk			1
keep your hands to yourself			0
he should avoid women , he added , as he did n’t have the strength to ‘ resist their charms ’			1
when he spent a month in a @entity192 jail over his involvement in a protest against @entity5 bombing exercises on a local island , he told his diary : ‘ there ’s no women			1
i ’m happy ! ’ on the eve of being released , he claimed he had a ‘ three - point plan ’ to fix his ‘ greatest defect			1
such high hopes appeared to last little more than two weeks before he was again recording the names of women he had seduced			0
the infidelity in the 2001 diary alone would be enough for any philanderer , but inevitably it was only one chapter in @entity20 ’s bed - hopping lifestyle			1
@entity242 is serial adultery was cited ten years later in the breakdown of his marriage to @entity21 , whom he had known since she was 14			0
they also shared a history of alcoholism , which @entity166 compounded with a drug problem , being convicted of heroin possession in 1983			1
@entity21 was pregnant with their first child when they married in 1994 , just a few weeks after he divorced first wife , @entity254			0
@entity37 , far left , photographed in 2001 at a charity event for the @entity256			0
according to his secret diary , @entity20 had dalliances with three different women , including intercourse with one , during the evening @entity20 — who has talked in the past about running for the @entity262 — clearly regards himself as a public figure			2
he has endorsed various democrats in presidential campaigns and appeared in an ad campaign for @entity267			0
yesterday , he faced further embarrassment as the @entity103 published what he revealed in his diary about fellow public figures			2
@entity166 , who has positioned himself as a lion of the @entity273 , described @entity274 as ‘ an idiot and a puppet ’ a day after 9/11			1
but he was equally damning of black allies on the @entity273			0
civil rights activist and presidential contender @entity193 was a ‘ buffoon ’ whose ‘ venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership ’			2
fellow civil rights firebrand @entity283 was , he wrote , a publicity addict who made him feel ‘ dirty ’			2
the @entity20 brand remains so strong that @entity166 will be forgiven his political posturing in time , but his sexual antics will be rather harder to sweep away			2
his compulsive infidelity is particularly damning given that the @entity154 have been in a bitter dispute with his wife ’s family over the circumstances of her death			0
@entity21 was found hanged in a garage at her home in @entity296 , outside @entity139 , in may last year			2
she had been struggling with depression , alcoholism and financial problems as she fought a vicious divorce and child custody battle with her estranged husband			2
the year before her death , the @entity20 camp leaked a shocking court affidavit from @entity166 in which he asked for a protection order against his wife			2
@entity20 claimed she had been violently abusing him since they married , and once — in a rage about his friendship with his ex-wife @entity254 — hit him in the face , her engagement ring crushing his tear duct and causing permanent damage			0
but even he implied she was justified in telling their children he was a ‘ sex addict ’			2
by 2001 — the year covered by the diary — he was ‘ committing numerous infidelities to keep my sanity ’ , he admitted in the affidavit			1
after @entity21 ’s death , @entity20 — who was dating the actress and @entity324 star @entity125 at the time — said his wife had phoned him the day before her death pleading for help			0
‘ she told me that she was sorry for everything			0
that everything was her fault , ’ he told police			0
but her family were so appalled by his behaviour towards her that they insisted on holding a separate memorial service , from which the @entity154 were excluded			0
we now know at least partly what might have sent @entity338 out of her mind — even , according to their housekeeper , once attacking her husband with a pair of scissors as he sat in the bath			0
some women would say he was lucky she did n’t kill him , given the way he behaved			0
the ‘ curse of the @entity154 ’ may have become a part of @entity5 folklore , but from the evidence of @entity166 ’s self - pitying diary , no one believes in it more than the family does .			1

when he had bedded yet another woman , he would go home and write in a diary that the liaison constituted yet another ‘ mugging ’ — of him
there were far too few days when his ‘ lust demons ’ , as he called them , did not win their battle .
part self - flagellating @entity78 mea culpa , and part smutty schoolboy boasting
after his father was assassinated in 1968 , @entity166 ‘ struggled to be a grown up ’
