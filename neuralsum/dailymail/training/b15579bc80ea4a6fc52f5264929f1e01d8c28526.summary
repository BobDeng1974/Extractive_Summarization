by @entity0 a new bus timetable is giving commuters a real pain in the neck - because it has been placed 7ft up a lamppost			2
the sign , on a street in @entity8 , @entity9 , is so high up that it it completely out of sight for some passengers			1
@entity14 , who spotted the sign , said the information board was so high up it was almost useless			1
bus users have been left with a pain in the neck after a bus timetable has been positioned seven feet up a lamppost anyone hoping to read the top of the sign would need the help of a foot stall or ladder			1
mr @entity14 said the position of the sign was ' useless '			1
the 62 - year - old said : ' i am about 5ft 9in and have pretty good eyesight , but i find it hard work to see the bus times			0
@entity14 , who spotted the sign and is 5ft 9 , said the information board was so high up it was almost useless ' after studying it for a while i got a real crick in my neck			1
' you would have to be 7ft tall not to have to crane your neck			0
' i do n’t know how anyone smaller than me or with worse eyesight is going to be able to see any of the information			0
' the timetable is the normal small print and is going to be very , very hard for anyone to read if the information they need is at the top of the timetable			2
' i really do n’t know why anyone would put an information board up so high on a lamppost			0
' it just does n’t make any sense at all			0
' the timetable is supposed to be there to help people but it ’s not going to be much help if people ca n’t read the information , is it ? ' mr @entity14 spotted the notice when he was helping to cut the hedge at a church in the street			1
he said he thought the shape of the lamppost , which has a ' bulge ' on the lower part , might be the reason behind the placement			0
however , he said : ' if they ca n’t put the timetable on any lower because of the shape of the lamppost , then surely it is better not to put it on at all			2
' it is just no good to anyone as it is			0
' @entity78 - spokesman for @entity79 - said the company had an occasional problem with people moving timetables on lampposts			1
' it sounds as if someone has pushed the timetable up the lamppost , ' he said			2
' i shall send out a team to reposition it at a more sensible height and tighten the brackets to make it more difficult to move in future			0

the sign , on a street in @entity8 , @entity9 , can barely be seen by some
@entity14 , who spotted the sign , said timetable was almost useless
but @entity79 say it may have been ' moved up the post by a *vandal* '
