by @entity0 mystery : the naked and decomposing body of @entity3 , 31 , was found locked inside a holdall in the bath of his home in @entity8 , central @entity9 , in august 2010 the @entity12 spy whose body was found locked in a sports bag may have been killed by a secret agent , his family said yesterday			1
their barrister suggested a sinister cover - up had left them with no way of knowing how and why @entity3 died			1
one theory is that he died at the hands of a colleague			0
another is that a foreign agent killed him because of his espionage work			0
the discovery of the body in his flat near the @entity12 headquarters in @entity9 sparked a 20 - month police inquiry that has drawn a blank			2
at a public hearing yesterday , it emerged that the flat may have been swept clean of evidence , with no fingerprints or @entity40 anywhere			2
it was also revealed that – far from being a back - office worker – mr @entity3 had just completed training for deployment on operations			1
other revelations included : the unclothed body of the super-fit maths prodigy was found in a large padlocked @entity51 bag in the bath of his @entity53 - owned @entity8 flat in august 2010			2
the codebreaker from @entity57 , @entity58 , had links to @entity9 's bondage and gay scene and it had already been suggested a sex game , possibly with a colleague , may have had a tragic end			0
but @entity66 coroner dr @entity65 was told yesterday his grieving family fear whoever is responsible expertly covered up the evidence			0
their barrister @entity71 rejected the conclusion of an internal @entity12 inquiry that mr @entity3 's death ' had nothing to do with his work '			1
suspicions : relatives believe a third party was either present when @entity3 died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence , lawyer @entity71 said mr @entity3 , pictured riding his bike , was found dead inside a body bag similar to the one pictured , right he said : ' there is a high probability that some third party was in the flat when @entity3 was placed in the bag			1
evidentially there seems to be no trace of an unknown party in the flat			0
' our impression is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts or secret services			0
' or perhaps evidence has been removed from the scene post-mortem by experts in those arts			2
' mr @entity3 was nearing the end of a one - year secondment from the @entity109 listening station to the headquarters of the @entity12 , or @entity12 , in @entity111 , @entity9			1
dr @entity65 was told a wide - ranging and highly sensitive police inquiry has left many questions unanswered over the circumstances of his death			2
experts believe it would have been ' difficult , if not impossible ' for mr @entity3 to lock himself in the bag but can find no evidence of anyone else being present			1
his body was found curled in the foetal position in the 140 - litre black and red holdall with the keys to the @entity127 travel padlock beneath him			0
pathologists found no evidence of injuries or that he attempted to fight his way out			2
it remains possible that his dead body was put inside the bag			0
last images : @entity137 released @entity138 of his last known movements at @entity141 tube station questions : the family want to know why the alarm was not raised when mr @entity3 failed to turn up to work and why it took his sister @entity147 , pictured left at his funeral , to ring police to make them aware he was missing dr @entity65 said that whether mr @entity3 was alive inside the bag and locked it himself ' was at the very heart of this inquiry '			1
she may order officials to recreate how he could have got inside it at the full inquest which is due to take place next month			0
experts have been unable to agree on exactly how mr @entity3 died , favouring asphyxiation or hypercapnia , a catastrophic build - up of carbon dioxide in the blood			1
their work was hampered by the heavily decayed state of his body and his @entity12 colleagues face questions over why they did not raise the alarm earlier			2
it also emerged yesterday that @entity174 detectives spent almost 20 months pursuing a dna trace on his body that was left by a clumsy forensic scientist			1
the chief executive of @entity178 will be hauled before the inquest to explain the astonishing blunder which was discovered only two weeks ago			0
red herring : it also emerged that a @entity184 couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to mr @entity3 's death the inquest also heard that a @entity184 couple who called at mr @entity3 's block had nothing to do with the case			1
detectives released e-fits of the couple and have now traced them			0
they were looking for a friend 's house			0
the inquest heard that mr @entity3 's family were unhappy about several aspects of the inquiry , including the role of counter-terrorism officers who dealt with @entity12 and @entity109 staff			1
they have raised questions about who ordered a second post-mortem examination and what happened to mr @entity3 's possessions held in a work locker			1
the family also want to hear more details about the nature of his work but @entity12 representatives said disclosing the information could endanger national security			0
dr @entity65 attacked police for delaying the handover of evidence and questioned why the names of some witnesses had been withheld			0
she said some sensitive letters had gone missing			0
@entity12 has applied for several of mr @entity3 's colleagues to give evidence anonymously and from behind screens .			1

@entity3 's family believe a third party was either present when he died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence
crime scene forensic scientist ’s own dna was found on mr @entity3 ’s hand
relatives wanted to know why the alarm was not raised when mr @entity3 failed to turn up at work - by then his body was badly decomposed for *analysis*
it also emerged that a @entity184 couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to mr @entity3 ’s death
an expert seeking signs of forced entry said he was hampered because the front door had been taken from its hinges and locks removed ;
pathologists still can not agree on how mr @entity3 died . the 31 - year - old suffered no *visible* injuries and could not have locked himself in the bag according to police ;
@entity40 found on his hand that police rated as highly *significant* was in fact left by a bungling forensic scientist .
