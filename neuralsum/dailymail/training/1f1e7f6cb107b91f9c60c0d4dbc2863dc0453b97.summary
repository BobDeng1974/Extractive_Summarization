a gleaming green comet tore across the @entity1 in its closest encounter with @entity3 to date			1
@entity4 lit up the night 's sky on wednesday , shooting north			1
it was the final burst for the newly - discovered meteor , which has already been seen rocketing over @entity8 and @entity9			0
and the astronomer who first spotted the rare wonder said next time it may come even closer			0
' there is also excitement around what the comet might do , so there is a couple of days before it is possible to determine the future path of a comet which has a large bearing on how close it will get to us and how bright it might get			0
' for the past week , the comet has been getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the @entity37 to spot @entity4 , is around 43 million miles from @entity3 and was thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second			1
the comet , also known as @entity40 , was first spotted by @entity42 @entity41 , who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers			1
to date , mr @entity4 , from @entity45 , has discovered five comets , all using relatively simple equipment compared to what 's found at a professional observatory			0
it was first spotted on august 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world			2
stunning : views of the comet are expected to be best in around a week 's time when it will be visible ' from light - polluted city suburbs ' this graph shows how @entity4 's trajectory is taking it northwards outside our planet 's orbit - it will be closest to us on january 7 comets are essentially piles of rock , gravel , and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice			1
as the comet nears the sun , its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight			0
they also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the @entity3 's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers			2
as the graph shows though , the comet 's trajectory does not take it inside the @entity3 's orbit			2
at its current levels of brightness , @entity4 can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult			2
a comet 's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale , lower numbers indicate more intense brightness			0
at its current levels of brightness , @entity4 can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult it was first spotted on august 17 and in recent weeks was dramatically captured on camera by stargazers in @entity108 , above @entity4 started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5 , the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope			1
as @entity115 reports , comet @entity4 should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-january , which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet ' from light - polluted city suburbs '			0
some observers were able to spot @entity4 in late december as it reached magnitude 5.3			0
@entity4 's striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet : cyanogen and diatomic carbon , which both glow green when sunlight passes through them			1
guide : stargazers hoping to see the celestial body can use this graph to locate the comet 's position in relation to well - known constellations			1

@entity4 first spotted in august by an amateur astronomer and is currently shooting northwards past @entity3
the celestial body is leaving a magnificent trail of glowing green ice and gas in its wake as it passes over our skies
