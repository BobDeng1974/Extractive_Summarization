by @entity0 for @entity1 dangerous or just creative ? authorities in a @entity4 school district suspended @entity6 teacher @entity5 and some claim it was over fear he 'd turn his sci - fi novels about school shootings into reality a @entity4 @entity6 teacher is on academic probation after authorities became concerned that he might act out his sci - fi novels about mass shootings			1
if the novels first tipped authorities off last month about @entity19 , his ' several aliases ' and the model school building he kept in his @entity23 home got them seriously worried			1
but the 23 - year - old first - year teacher was never arrested , leading some to suggest his treatment is little more than a witch hunt			1
however , authorities said tuesday that it 's @entity30 's mental wellbeing and not threats of violence that had them worried			2
so why did authorities search the school where @entity5 taught eighth grade language arts for bombs before students returned for class last week ? ' [ we ] agreed that the prudent thing to do was search for any type of weapons or implements or devices that could be damaging to children , ' sheriff @entity41 told the @entity50 on tuesday			1
that decision came after the area school board was told about a man named dr. @entity54 , who 'd written the novels the @entity56 and a sequel called @entity58			1
that man also once went by @entity60 , whose name was legally changed to @entity5			0
authorities also searched @entity5 's home , where he lived with his mother , and they discovered the model school building			1
the k - 9 bomb - sniffing units sent into @entity68 's @entity67 suggest authorities feared @entity30 would act out some grim fantasy			2
however , state 's attorney @entity71 now claims authorities acted out solely out of fear for the teacher 's mental health			2
evidence ? @entity5 wrote a book set in the year 2900 , as well as a sequel , about a gruesome school shooting under the pen name dr. @entity54 according to the @entity50 , officials revealed after the search that @entity5 had written a letter with ' suicidal undertones ' to school higher - ups			1
instead , he was taken in for a psychological evaluation			1
however , authorities chose not to share all of the details of the case until this week			0
the tight - lipped authorities gave free speech proponents room to launch a campaign demanding @entity5 be reinstated			2
' this superstitious demonizing of literature strikes at the heart of our most fundamental liberties , ' reads a @entity99 petition , which boasts nearly 2,000 posted in support of @entity30			0
@entity101 has now denied the books had anything to do with the actions of his office			0
' it did n't start with the books and it did n't end with the books , ' he told the @entity110			0
' it 's not even a factor in what law enforcement is doing now			0
' an attorney for @entity30 , @entity116 , told @entity110 that his client ' is receiving treatment			0
' police were concerned enough over a letter @entity5 wrote to sweep the middle school where he taught for bombs			0
however , the @entity123 later said they feared only for @entity30 's mental health and that the letter had ' suicidal undertones '			0

authorities in @entity4 's @entity130 worried about 23 - year - old @entity19 's ' several aliases '
the language teacher used the pen name dr. @entity54 on his two science *fiction* novels that deal with school shootings
@entity5 was put on *administrative* leave from his 8th grade teaching *job* and given a psychological evaluation
