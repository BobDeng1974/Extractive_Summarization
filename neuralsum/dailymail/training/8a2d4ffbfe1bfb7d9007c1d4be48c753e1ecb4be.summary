@entity0 claimed welfare reforms had left claimants ' forced to steal to survive ' a former @entity4 minister has urged juries not to convict people for stealing if their benefits have been withdrawn			1
@entity0 , an ex-environment minister , claimed that @entity9 ’s welfare reforms had left claimants ‘ forced to steal to survive ’			1
in an inflammatory newspaper article , he said the policy of removing benefits from those who failed to attend scheduled job interviews was ‘ crucifying millions of people ’			2
and he said it would be ‘ perfectly reasonable ’ for jurors to follow the example set by those in the 19th century , who refused to convict desperate food thieves to save them from being hanged			1
@entity22 chairman @entity21 called mr @entity0 ’s comments ‘ ludicrous ’ and said they amounted to an amnesty on crime			1
mr @entity0 , who served in @entity28 ’s government , wrote : ‘ a million people have been sanctioned by government ministers over the last year , which means they are deprived of all their benefit for often petty infringements such as being five minutes late for a job interview – and hence have no money for at least four weeks and sometimes three months , forcing them to steal to survive			1
‘ @entity9 supervises the sanctioning – though it ’s outsourced to a privatised firm doing his dirty work for him – while [ justice secretary ] @entity39 takes care of the imprisonment			0
’ the mp for @entity43 and @entity44 added : ‘ during and after the napoleonic wars there were up to 200 offences for which a person could be hanged , usually for stealing to keep their family alive			0
‘ the people of this country sitting on the juries finally got round this draconian repression imposed by the ruling class by refusing to convict			1
that is what juries and magistrates should do now when faced by the stark injustice of the criminal justice system			2
’ writing in the far - @entity63 newspaper , he accused ministers of ‘ crucifying millions of people even to the point where they ’re denying them food and shelter ’			0
asked about his comments on @entity72 yesterday , he gave examples from his constituency of two people who had their benefits removed for missing job interviews			0
one said the interview letter had been sent to an old address , and another had told the @entity80 he was having an operation that day			0
mr @entity0 told presenter @entity83 that people who could not find a job in their area had no to option but to steal			1
‘ that person should never have been put in that position , the authorities should n’t have removed benefit , ’ he said			2
callers to the programme were split on the issue , but some who disagreed had previously received benefits			0
mr @entity0 blamed @entity9 ( left ) , secretary of state for work and pensions , and @entity39 ( right ) , the secretary of state for justice , for depriving people across @entity100 however mr @entity21 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s ludicrous comments betray how out of touch the @entity4 are			1
@entity4 have opposed every decision we ’ve taken to get people off benefits and back into work			0
and now they want an amnesty on crime			1
hard - working taxpayers would pay the price			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said that ‘ the @entity4 does not condone illegal behaviour ’			0
the @entity80 said sanctions were only applied to 6 per cent of claimants			2
benefit payments were stopped 853,000 times in the year to june 2014 , a slight fall on the previous year , for failing to attend appointments or rejecting job offers			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it ’s unhelpful to make these claims without demonstrating any solid evidence			0
‘ sanctions are a necessary part of the benefits system , but they are used as a last resort in a tiny percentage of cases where people do n’t play by the rules			0
’ he added : ‘ we also have a well - established system of hardship payments for benefit claimants who have little or no other resources available to them			1

*ex-minister* @entity0 urges juries not to convict benefit thieves
he claimed welfare reforms had left claimants ' forced to steal to survive '
but *critics* slam his ' ludicrous ' idea as creating an amnesty on crime
