a gp has made a passionate attack on the sickness benefits culture by using professor @entity3 as an example of someone not held back by disability			1
dr @entity7 was so incensed by the thousands of patients ‘ hell - bent ’ on trying to prove they are ill just to claim benefits that he considered displaying a poster of the physicist with the caption : ‘ this bloke is not on the sick			2
’ he described how entire surgeries are filled with the ‘ disgruntled unworking well ’ who are ‘ full of indignation at being considered reasonably healthy ’			0
sign : professor @entity3 suffers from motor neuron disease , but is one of the most celebrated theoretical physicists in the world the doctor , who practises in @entity26 , said it was absurd how he was being asked to spend so much time trying to prove patients were ill when he was meant to be making them better			1
‘ we are , as a profession , dedicated to making our patients as healthy as possible , and yet a proportion of punters are hell - bent on trying to prove they ’re really ill , and need us to confirm it , ’ he said in a column for the doctors ’ magazine pulse			0
‘ the fact is , nearly everyone is capable of some kind of work			0
i had considered , at one point , putting up a portrait of professor @entity3 in my consulting room with a caption that said , “ this bloke is not on the sick			1
” ’ professor @entity3 has motor neurone disease , which has left him almost entirely paralysed and only able to communicate through a speech - generating device			1
criticism : gps should not be responsible for signing people off as too ill to work , argues dr @entity56 ( file picture ) despite his disabilities , he is one of the most eminent scientists in the world and has won numerous awards for his research			1
dr @entity7 said gps were ‘ wasting far too much time ’ assessing whether patients were well enough to work			2
work and pensions secretary @entity66 has argued many people on sickness benefits are capable of work ‘ the dilemma of constantly dealing with requests to confirm illnesses that i have already sorted out is wasting far too much time and muddying the doctor - patient relationship , ’ he wrote			0
government figures published earlier this year showed that only one in eight people on sickness benefits was really too ill to work			0
yet polls have shown that three quarters of gps feel obliged to issue the sick notes to patients even if there is no medical need			1
dr @entity7 , who has been a gp for 26 years , said being deemed ‘ fit to work ’ did n’t mean that patients had to be available for a strenuous job			0
‘ being found fit for some kind of employment by @entity94 [ the firm that oversees the assessments ] does not mean you ’re necessarily capable of being an @entity99 agent or a lumberjack , ’ he wrote			2
‘ however , you might be able to work at a desk on a telephone , or hold a lollipop on a zebra crossing			0
‘ and we all know , without any shadow of a doubt , that any form of regular employment is not only financially beneficial but also leads to less depression , greater social contact , increased well - being , a decreasing tendency to addiction and social deprivation , and an increased likelihood of being in a stable relationship			0
’ in may a poll of 4,000 family doctors by the @entity120 found that three quarters felt obliged to issue sick notes , which allow patients to claim benefits , even though they were not strictly ill. many doctors admitted they did not know enough about the system and were compelled to sign patients off if they had emotional problems .			1
