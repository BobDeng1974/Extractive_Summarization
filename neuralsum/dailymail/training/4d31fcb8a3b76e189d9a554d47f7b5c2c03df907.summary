we have been treated to some cracking @entity2 action this season with some excellent individual performances			1
@entity6 lead and have been dominant , but only three points separate them and @entity8			1
we ’re almost half way through as we enter 2015 and here is @entity12 columnist @entity11 's @entity2 team of the season so far ... goalkeeper @entity16 ( @entity17 ) over the last two years he has been the only @entity17 player performing at the levels you would expect of that club			1
he has matured , gets more reliable with every game he plays and is now absolutely key to any success they have			0
@entity16 makes a superb save to deny @entity26 in one of his many excellent displays this season @entity29 has been @entity17 's best player this year , earning them valuable points defence @entity33 ( @entity34 ) @entity33 ’s has been an incredible rise			1
he has gone from @entity36 to @entity34 to @entity37 and not once looked out of his depth			2
it will be a job for anyone to replace him in @entity42 ’s team			2
@entity33 has developed hugely at @entity34 this year , putting in a string of top performances the @entity34 full back 's form has earned him an @entity37 call - up this season @entity48 ( @entity6 ) @entity49 has been good but @entity48 is now @entity6 ’s main man in defence			1
he has learned from his partner but is an excellent defender in his own right			0
he is strong , committed and one of the key reasons behind @entity6 ’s fantastic start			2
@entity48 has been a rock at the back for @entity6 alongside @entity49 as they have dominated the league @entity61 ( @entity8 ) he has suffered with some injury niggles but @entity61 is still a supreme defender			1
more than that , his qualities as a man are so impressive			0
he carries himself and his club with dignity and is a class act on and off the pitch			0
despite injury problems , @entity61 has shown this season that he is still a top class defender @entity72 ( @entity73 ) his team might be struggling for form , but @entity72 is still my top left back			1
he put his @entity79 disappointment behind him and has attacked with great freedom for @entity73 this season			2
@entity72 had a poor @entity79 but is getting back to his best for @entity73 despite his club 's struggles midfield @entity86 ( @entity6 ) he ’s like a boxer you just ca n’t hit			1
hazard is so fast and tricky and he is now dictating games			0
he decides when he wants to go past defenders — they have no say in the matter			0
when he is at his best , as he has been so far this season , @entity86 is almost unplayable for a defender hazard has scored six @entity2 goals already this season , and is one of @entity6 's main threats @entity101 ( @entity6 ) i was surprised to see him move to @entity6 , but he has been sensational			1
there is a great simplicity to his passing game and he is playing the best football of his career			0
even after time at @entity111 , this team give him the best options he ’s ever had			2
@entity101 is enjoying life at @entity6 , conducting things from midfield with options all around him @entity117 ( @entity6 ) @entity117 perfectly understands his role in this @entity6 team			2
he is good in possession but knows the value of getting back to slam the door shut			0
his defensive platform allows @entity6 ’s attackers to do what they do best			2
sitting in front of @entity6 's back four , @entity117 gives his team - mates the platform to build from @entity130 ( @entity131 ) when he plays on the left , the picture is clearer for him — he cuts inside so well and his work - rate is infectious			1
with that he has great quality and has scored important goals			0
since joining from @entity111 , @entity130 has fast become @entity131 's most important attacking player strikers @entity140 ( @entity8 ) shifts direction in an instant and his change of pace leaves defenders for dead			1
he is strong , level - headed and shows perfect balance , physically and mentally			0
just behind @entity148 he would be unstoppable			0
@entity140 celebrates scoring at the @entity150 - the striker has been prolific this season for @entity8 @entity148 ( @entity6 ) a brute of a striker			1
he does n’t stand and wait to be kicked — he makes sure he kicks defenders first			0
he lays down @entity148 ’s law and has adapted perfectly to @entity158 football			0
since arriving from @entity159 , @entity148 has been something of a goal machine @entity148 has netted twelve times in the @entity2 since joining @entity6 at the beginning of the season manager @entity166 ( @entity6 ) selling @entity167 for £ 50million is enough to win manager of the year ! he saw weaknesses in his team and fixed them in the transfer window			1
perhaps the only blip was letting go of @entity174			0
will he come back to haunt @entity166 ? @entity166 has put together a strong side with good transfer dealings , and @entity6 are top of the league			1

three @entity37 *internationals* make @entity11 's team of the season
three *summer* *signings* are also in the @entity2 xi
@entity6 are top of the league , and four of their stars are in the team
just one @entity8 player features , but which one does @entity11 pick ?
