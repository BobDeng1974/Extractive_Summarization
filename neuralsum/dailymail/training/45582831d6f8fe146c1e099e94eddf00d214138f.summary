by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 20:18 est , 9 january 2013 high street stalwart @entity1 is on the verge of collapse			1
the photography chain looks likely to become the first major retail failure of the @entity6 after appointing administrators today			1
branch closures are said to be ‘ inevitable ’ and the future appears grim for the 2,000 staff at the company ’s 200 stores			1
camera specialist @entity1 could soon be 2013 's first major high street casualty and customers who bought products in the run - up to @entity17 will struggle to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods			1
it appears that poor festive trading was the final nail in the coffin for a @entity26 ’s only specialist nationwide camera retailer , a fixture on @entity28 for almost 80 years			1
@entity1 has struggled to cope with changes in technology , specifically the shift to digital technology			2
most smartphones now have powerful cameras built into them , which means families have no need of a separate device			2
and most people store and share their photographs digitally rather than paying to print them			0
@entity41 ’s @entity40 said his firm was holding discussions with stakeholders to see if the business could be preserved			0
he said : ‘ trading in the stores is hoped to continue , but is critically dependent on these ongoing discussions			1
however , it is inevitable that there will be store closures			0
’ @entity1 was tonight offering its gift vouchers , despite administrators saying they would no longer be accepted			1
the gift cards – available in denominations between £ 20 and £ 500 – were on sale on the retailer ’s website			1
administrator @entity41 said @entity1 was not in a position to honour the vouchers at present , and it would also not accept returned goods			0
@entity41 said the company ’s core market had seen a ‘ significant decline ’ in 2012 and its position had ‘ deteriorated ’ in the run - up to @entity17 , as a result of reducing confidence in @entity69 retail			1
forecasts for 2013 indicated the decline would continue , @entity41 added			1
it said extra funding was made available to the company , but @entity1 did not generate the profits it had planned over @entity17			1
mr @entity40 said discussions to raise additional financial support had been held between the directors , lenders and suppliers over the past few days			0
but the directors had appointed administrators in light of ‘ irreconcilable differences ’			1
1935 - @entity1 started trading when @entity86 opened his first store in @entity88 selling 16mm cine films			0
the business expanded significantly when @entity86 ’s son @entity91 came on board , and set about transforming it into a cut - price retailer of photographic equipment			1
1970s - @entity1 moves to a new 20,000 sq ft site on @entity88 's @entity97 , which is later named as the largest photography store in the world by @entity100			0
1980 - a second store is opened on the @entity102 in @entity103			0
by the end of the decade the retailer had 50 stores			1
1996 - @entity91 retires and firm is sold in a management buyout			0
2001 - the 200th store opened in july			0
the retailer had expanded to cover @entity111 to @entity112 , as well as stores in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
2002 - @entity117 acquired a controlling interest in the business			0
2004 - the retailer was floated on the @entity121			2
2008 - @entity1 ' @entity97 premises in @entity88 is closed			0
2009 - @entity1 narrowly avoided administration by securing a debt - for - equity swap with its lenders @entity125			0
2012 - the retailer made losses of £ 5.2million , when it also lost both its chief executive @entity128 and chairman @entity129			2
the chain was launched in 1935 by @entity86 , who opened the first photography store in @entity88			0
but the firm has had a rocky few years			0
it managed to avoid administration in 2009 after its bank wiped out its debts in return for a 47 per cent stake in the business			0
a number of household names – @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , blacks , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 – all went into administration in 2012 and the @entity150 has warned the pattern could continue into 2013			2
@entity150 director general @entity152 said : ‘ if you look at the amount of money people have got in their pockets , that is expected to continue to be under pressure			2
’ @entity1 looks likely to become one of several household names that has fallen into administration in recent months as struggling families cut down on spending			0
the number of @entity167 chains going bust has increased by almost a fifth in two years , figures released last week showed			1
some 194 stores and chains fell into administration during 2012 , compared to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010 , according to data from @entity174			2
everything must go : last year saw the demise of @entity144 , left , and @entity142 , right , among others , as consumers cut back on their spending in 2012 last year saw the demise of @entity142 , @entity144 and @entity147 , with @entity148 , blacks and @entity146 also entering administration			0
but the number going under in the run - up to @entity17 dropped , with 37 chains folding in the final three months of 2012 , compared with 42 in the same period in 2011			1
should @entity1 go fully into administration it will mark the first high profile retail collapse of 2013 , with others certain to follow			2
online retailer @entity189 is to shut down its retail business and become solely a marketplace for other retailers from march			2
the @entity114 - based company blamed the end of the @entity196 loophole which allowed items under £ 15 to be sold to the @entity69 vat free from the @entity199 .			1

camera retailer has become first major @entity167 casualty of 2013 after calling in administrators
the move puts more than 2,000 jobs at risk at its 193 stores across the @entity69
@entity210 reported worse than expected @entity17 clothing sales
