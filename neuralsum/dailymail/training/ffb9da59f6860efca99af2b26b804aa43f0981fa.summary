the tragedy happened when the @entity9 , believed to be on a reconnaissance mission , came down in a mountainous @entity12 stronghold close to the @entity14 border			1
soon after the crash at 11am local time , @entity12 insurgents claimed they had shot the helicopter down with a rocket			1
dangerous work : a @entity22 9 helicopter flying over the desert in the @entity25 province , @entity7 ( file picture ) the @entity22 helicopter and crew were believed to have been based at @entity29			2
the crash occurred near the @entity14 border at 11am local time but military sources told @entity33 that the @entity1 - made helicopter , which has an excellent safety record , suffered a catastrophic technical failure and that no enemy action was involved			1

there was speculation last night that some of those on board may have been special forces			0
it is the first time @entity1 helicopter crew have been killed in more than a decade of flying in @entity7 , and comes just months before all combat troops on the @entity65 - led mission pull out of the country			1

’ the helicopter crashed near a village in the @entity104 district , near @entity105 in south - east of @entity7 , and only a few minutes ’ flying time from the helicopter ’s base			1
there were no reports of enemy activity in the area of deserts and mountains , which is outside @entity1 ’s main theatre of war in @entity25			2
but @entity29 remains volatile and one @entity12 spokesman claimed in a text message to local journalists that the ‘ mujahedeen ’ had brought the helicopter down with a rocket launcher			1
insurgents also wrote online that the ‘ wreckage caught fire as it smashed on to the ground , killing all invaders onboard ’			0
but local officials insisted the crash had been a tragic accident			2

an inquiry will be carried out by the @entity141 to establish the cause of the crash			0
the @entity22 helicopter and her crew were believed to have been based at @entity29			0
the base is home to 657 squadron @entity42 , which flies the @entity22 in an escort role protecting transport helicopters such as the @entity151 and @entity152 which are more vulnerable to attack from @entity12 gunmen			2
those killed are thought to be two passengers and three crew members from the @entity42 , the unit @entity5 , above , belonged to when he flew @entity44 helicopter gunships in @entity7 last year there are 2,000 serving personnel with @entity42 , including specialists from the @entity163 who repair helicopter , and officers , such as prince @entity5 , who are attached from their own regiment – in his case the @entity169			2
@entity170 , belongs to 7 @entity171 , a unit supporting the @entity172 and @entity173			0
@entity22 helicopters , made by @entity175 in @entity176 , are the world ’s fastest and can reach speeds of 185mph			0
a decade ago four @entity49 servicemen died when a @entity22 ditched into the sea off @entity181			0
and in may 2006 five @entity1 personnel were killed when a @entity22 helicopter crashed in @entity184 , southern @entity185 , after it was struck by a surface - to - air missiles fired by insurgents			1

sometimes they have to fly helicopters in conditions that no civilian would , such as evacuating casualties or delivering supplies			0
‘ i would certainly pay tribute to the bravery of anybody who is prepared to put their life on the line like that			0
’ he said in hostile territory helicopter pilots often had to fly at great speed or close to the ground , often hampered by dust storms			2
