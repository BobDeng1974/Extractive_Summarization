by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 14:47 est , 18 january 2013 a department of @entity3 ’s equivalent of the @entity4 installed surveillance cameras and assigned a surveillance officer to capture a suspected toilet roll thief on their premises			1
the @entity9 , which track white collar criminals , organised gangs and terrorists , spent thousands on the investigation after cleaners reported an ‘ unusally high ’ usage of toilet paper			1
a secret camera was installed in the stairwell of @entity19 5 in @entity20 , @entity21 and a detective who used to listen to covert telephone recordings of crooks was assigned to overall command of ‘ @entity26 , ’ as the media have dubbed it			1
paper thief : the @entity3 federal police spent thousands of euros on the investigation to find out who stole the toilet roll cleaners in the building reported that rolls were going missing from their delivery bags when left unattended			1
however , once the cameras were set up , and the bags containing the prize were left unguarded , the investigation failed to catch anyone stealing the loot			0
the public prosecutor ’s office in nearby @entity46 was informed of the secret op which ran for a year - and - a - half but was suspended in 2011			0
it has only come to light now after an internal inquiry ruled the ‘ personal rights ’ of all employees in the building had been violated			0
always watching : the department installed a @entity56 camera which was watched by a designated investigator private investigation : the @entity9 department ran the secret operation for 18 months officials who sanctioned the covert operation would have needed the permission of a judge to make it legal - something they did n’t do			2
lawyers have argued that the case is of ' petty crime ' and the use of surveillance does not match up to the the thefts			0
@entity3 ’s main police trade union has now demanded an independent commission of enquiry about the affair and disciplinary proceedings against those who sanctioned it .			2

@entity3 police spent ' thousands ' to catch the office *'s* toilet roll ( *translated* into @entity3 ' *klopapier* ' ) thief
designated surveillance *expert* in charge of ' @entity26 '
yet after installing the camera , no *evidence* of theft was found
