by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:03 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 14 september 2012 naked rambler @entity2 - who has spent years in solitary confinement in a @entity6 jail - was branded arrogant and self - indulgent by a sheriff after refusing to get dressed and go home to @entity9			1
@entity2 , from @entity10 , was brought into a draughty courtroom naked but for a pair of handcuffs today to be quizzed on why he had refused social work and psychiatric help			1
the ex-marine was jailed for five months at @entity18 , @entity19 , for committing a breach of the peace			1
@entity2 arrives at @entity22 in 2004 after completing a 900 - mile walk naked			1
over the course of the journey @entity2 was arrested numerous times he was found guilty of the offence last month after strolling naked near a swing park where children were playing in @entity30 , also in @entity19 , and refusing to put on clothes			1
sentence had been deferred for social workers to assess whether he needed psychiatric intervention			0
his arrest in july came just three days after he had been freed from prison in @entity37 , 30 miles to the north , after spending six years in solitary for previous offences involving nakedness			1
@entity2 , 53 , who insists he is not a naturist and claims his naked rambles are ' a protest , ' was initially removed from the dock after only five minutes when he refused to sit down so his privates were hidden by the wooden dock			1
he said : ' i just want to be treated like anybody else			0
' after he was brought back in , and agreed to sit , the court heard he had refused to meet social workers and so no assessment was available			0
prosecutor @entity53 said the @entity54 was prepared to help him go back to @entity9 if he co-operated			0
mr @entity53 said : ' the authorities are prepared to facilitate his return home if his behaviour does n’t cause alarm to the public			0
' pictured behind bars in the nude : @entity2 leaving @entity63 in july			1
he decided to represent himself rather than have a solicitor at his trial determined : @entity2 ( pictured here with his girlfriend @entity67 ) has been jailed for five months for committing a breach of the peace sheriff @entity70 told @entity2 , who has refused legal representation , said that he was concerned that he had not met or co-operated with social workers drawing up the background report ordered			1
the sheriff said : ' will you meet with them and assist them ? ' when @entity2 responded , ' no , not really ' , sheriff @entity70 said he had been left with no choice but to jail him for five months			1
the sentence was backdated until july 20th , the date of his arrest , meaning @entity2 will be freed again before @entity84			1
if he wins 50 percent time off for good behaviour - unlikely unless he drops his protest - he could be out in three weeks			0
he is likely to serve his sentence in @entity88 ’s tough @entity88			0
sheriff @entity70 told @entity2 he realised his motives for refusing to get dressed were not ' sinister , ' but slammed him for his refusal to co-operate with the preparation of a social background report			1
he said : ' i had hoped it [ the report ] would assist me in dealing with you without sending you back to prison - but you leave me no choice			2
' the police officers who arrested you told you that if you carried on your journey you would pass a playground occupied by children			2
unshaven : @entity2 pictured in july as he arrived at @entity63 after being arrested for walking around naked ' you were given three options - one , change direction , two , cover your private parts , or three , enter a police van which would take you around the playpark and release you on your way at the other side			1
' despite that , you refused , which showed disregard for other members of the public , in particular children who have the right not to see naked men			1
' that self - indulgence carries on today			0
' i have no other alternative option but to impose a custodial sentence			0
' @entity2 , of @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity10 , now has 18 convictions for nakedness			2
he first achieved notoriety during a naked walk from @entity130 to @entity22 in 2003			2
he went on to be repeatedly arrested and jailed for walking naked , and refusing to get dressed			2
he had tasted only minutes of freedom - usually being re-arrested at the prison gates for being naked - until his release from on july 17th			1
earlier this month @entity2 ’s former partner @entity134 , the mother to his two children , @entity136 , 16 and @entity137 , 14 , said she could not comprehend why he had given up family life , and knowing his children , simply to walk around naked			1
she said : ' i do n’t think @entity141 is a bad person , but he ’s made bad decisions			0
' i feel very sad for him , for what he ’s given up			0
' he lost his relationship with me			0
he has two beautiful children who are a real joy , but he has n’t been a father to them			2
' the price he ’s paid for his determination to go naked is too high			2
' when i told @entity141 , ‘ you ca n’t see the kids if you ’re going to go naked ’ , he said , ‘ @entity152 , i wo n’t see them			0
' he chose his cause over his children and he ’s continued to do so			0
' a @entity156 spokesman said : ' the actions of the accused made his arrest and prosecution necessary			0
' mr @entity2 intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents			1
' the evidence in this case clearly established that despite repeated police requests not to do so , he was determined to deliberately walk naked past a busy children 's play - park in @entity19			1
' he knew that in doing so he would provoke anger and upset			0
the sheriff held that his conduct constituted the crime of breach of the peace			0
' the spokesman said the police had gone to great lengths to to preven further offences being committed by mr @entity2			2
' for example , ' he said , ' on release from @entity88 in 2007 , police officers offered to take @entity2 to an address of his choosing in @entity186			2
' although he originally agreed to go with them , he changed his mind and attempted to walk from the prison along the @entity190 when he was arrested again			0
' the authorities are prepared to facilitate his return home providing his behaviour does not , as in the current case , cause public alarm and necessitate arrest to protect the public .			0
