@entity0 has called for a masters tournament for women at @entity3			1
@entity0 , who won the 2010 women 's @entity4 , first floated the idea on @entity7 following @entity9 's stunning victory at the masters on april 14 stating : ' i hope @entity10 will consider a women 's masters soon			1
they do so much to grow the game			0
fastest area of golf growth is women ! # @entity18 ? ' in the lead up to this week 's @entity20 in northern @entity21 , @entity0 suggested a women 's event could be staged the week following the men 's showpiece in april			1

why would n't you ? , ' @entity0 said			2
i think @entity3 and the masters and everybody with that event , they want to grow the game so badly			2
' that 's what it is , about growing the game and giving people opportunities			0
there 's no reason why we ca n't do that in women 's golf			1
we 're just as much a part of growing the game			0

i think somebody 's got to speak up and somebody 's got to say something			0
' it 's an idea , i do n't think that people should be ashamed to talk about it			0
i 'd like to know truthfully why we would n't be able to have a tournament there			0
