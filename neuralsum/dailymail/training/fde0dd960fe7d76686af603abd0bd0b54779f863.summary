despite no solid proof of its existence ever being found , it is one of @entity6 ’s most feared animals			2
but newly - unearthed records have revealed a six - month @entity9 investigation into the @entity10 proved it was far from a monster – and , rather , just a large pussycat			0
the probe in 1995 into the @entity13 and other unknown animals reported to have been roaming @entity6 found there was no ' verifiable evidence ' of exotic cats loose in the @entity6			1
@entity43 journalism professor @entity42 - an expert on contemporary myths - found the findings in a file at the @entity47 , reported @entity49 journalist @entity48			1

in july , @entity87 reported a recent alleged sighting of the ' beast ' when a teenager taking photographs in fields near his home in @entity26 spotted ‘ something run across the field ’			1
@entity96 , 19 , said at the time that the animal was ‘ absolutely massive and was hopping up and down like a large cat - there 's no way it was a fox or a dog ’			2
