by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 7 december 2013 a woman left heartbroken as a teenager after her date stood her up in the early 1980s has tracked down her man and now the couple are set to wed. @entity7 , 48 , and @entity8 , 50 , both from @entity9 , @entity6 met on holiday in @entity11 and were inseparable - until a week later a 19 - year - old @entity8 failed to turn up for a date with @entity7 , leaving her alone at a bus station			1
he did n't have her home phone number or address so he could n't contact her			2
@entity7 , who first met @entity8 in 1982 , aged 17 , said : ' we spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the sunday			1
together after 30 years : @entity8 , 50 , and @entity7 , 48 , are to walk down the aisle 31 years after they first met ' i arrived to meet @entity22 in @entity9 bus station and waited two hours but he never came and i was devastated			1
' in the year that followed , i looked for @entity8 in various places in @entity26 but never found him			2
' the months turned into years and @entity8 was always in my mind			0
' i searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end			0
' @entity7 spent 30 years looking for @entity8 and finally managed to track him down on @entity30 when he accepted her friend request it was because he thought she was interested in his fishing business			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity26 , @entity6 , said : ' i have no idea why i did n't turn up to meet her - i really ca n't remember			1
full circle : the couple celebrated their reunion by returning to the place it had all started - the @entity6 resort of @entity11 stood up : @entity9 bus station , as it is today , where @entity7 waited for two hours for @entity44 - to no avail ' i only joined @entity46 to promote my fishing pole repair business and i never normally accept friend requests from women unless they have something to do with fishing			1
' for some reason i assumed she was involved with fishing so i clicked to accept it and within seconds she had sent me a message			0
' things very quickly just clicked into place and we both decided we wanted to be together			0
aisle be yours : the pair are set to wed next summer ' it was just too good to be true			2
we both knew we had met the right person - i only wish i 'd known that 30 years ago			2
' @entity7 could n't believe her luck when she finally found @entity44 online			1
she said : ' i searched and there he was , that cheeky face which i recognised straight away			0
' ' i could n't believe it was my childhood sweetheart - i sent him a friend request and he accepted			2
' he said later he would n't normally accept a request out of the blue but it must have been meant to be			0
' we started texting and messaging each other and the bond between us became stronger each day , and our love grew stronger as each day passed by			0
' we eventually decided it was time to meet up after over 30 years apart and it was the scariest thing i have ever done			0
' @entity8 proposed to @entity7 18 months after she first found him online and now the couple are looking forward to their wedding next summer			1
@entity7 , who has five children from a previous marriage , said : ' as soon as i saw @entity8 , i knew from that moment all my hopes and dreams had come true			1
' i do n't know why @entity8 did n't turn up at the bus station back then and he ca n't remember why , either			0
' our story shows that it is never too late to find love			0

pair had a week - long *whirlwind* romance as teenagers
*lovestruck* @entity7 said she never forgot about her holiday beau
