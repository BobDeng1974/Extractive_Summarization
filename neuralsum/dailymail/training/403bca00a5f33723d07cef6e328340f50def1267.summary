from pulling petals off daisies to counting letters in people ’s names , people have used many dubious methods to work out whether they have a future with someone they fancy			0
but now a new home test claims to tell the difference between a fleeting fling and a relationship that could mean a couple live happily ever after , by using a combination of genetic and psychological tests			1
the kit offers an ‘ affordable way to test chemistry and compatibility long before a life - changing commitment is made , between a couple , ’ according to @entity17 , @entity19 - based firm , @entity20 , which devised the tests			1
happily ever after ? instant chemistry , a new home test , ( pictured ) claims to tell the difference between a fleeting fling and an enduring relationship using a combination of genetic and psychological tests the cad $ 149 ( £ 81 ) test comprises two ‘ quick and non-invasive ’ tests			1
instant chemistry collects a dna sample from an individual using a cheek swab and identifies the genetic make - up of part of their major histocompatibility complex ( @entity44 / @entity43 ) and serotonin uptake transporter ( 5 - @entity46 )			1
both people in the relationship must stow their spit in provided tubes and send the samples to the company so that it can analyse dna			2
the results are shown in an ‘ @entity54 ’ which is used to assess the person ’s compatibility with other individuals based on their @entity58			0
analysis of the genetic make - up of two individuals can help determine whether they will experience physical attraction and compatibility when they meet for the first time			1
or if the couple is already together this assessment can help determine strengths and weaknesses in overall compatibility in order to improve relationship success , the company said			0
scientists test for six gene variants in the @entity43 system that are associated with increased physical attraction and relationship success			0
they also analyse ‘ serotonin uptake transporter , ’ which is associated with emotional response and marital success			0
couples who have taken the test can log in to a secure online portal , complete the personality test and look at their compatibility results			0
the company claims to have come up with the first ever at - home compatibility test that is backed by scientific and psychological research – but it comes at a cost of cad $ 149 ( us $ 164 ; £ 81 )			1
the kit comprises three tests including one that compares the genetic strands of two people to report on their long - term compatibility and chemistry			1
‘ through intensive research scientists have found that long - term relationship satisfaction stems from two constants – your dna and core personality – and how those match up with your partners , ’ said dr @entity98 , chief science officer of @entity20			0
‘ the science behind @entity20 ’s kits is based on this research			0
by combining biological and psychological tests , we can determine how compatible you are with your partner and provide ways to offset incompatibilities , for example changing a small habit			2
’ the @entity117 contains two biological tests , one based on relationship satisfaction and the other on long - term chemistry			2
the @entity123 test , which is backed by research from @entity125 , determines how two people ’s brains process serotonin , revealing differences in their emotional reactions to varying situations			1
@entity132 is associated with relationship success and marital success			0
the second biological test , called @entity136 , is based on 20 years of research and looks at how well partners ’ genetic makeup complements each other			2
people taking the test send away a sample of their spit and let the scientists carry out the two biological tests , as well as taking an online personality test			2
they can log in to the company 's website to see how they are compatible in different ways - an example is pictured the kit comprises three tests including one that compares the genetic strands of two people to report on their long - term compatibility and chemistry			1
artwork of @entity36 is pictured this information can be used to look at key components of dna , such as how partners react to scent - a proven way to determine how physically attracted partners will be years from now , the firm explained			0
finally , a couple can do an online psychological compatibility test to identify each other ’s personality traits and what they mean in terms of stability and happiness in a relationship			2
‘ combined with the biological tests , @entity20 is able to determine the underlying compatibility of partners and recognise what will help a relationship to further grow , ’ the company claims			1
if compatibility is lacking , @entity20 provides ways to detect conflict before it arises and advice on ways to improve a relationship			0
wedding bells ? ' combined with the biological tests , @entity20 is able to determine the underlying compatibility of partners , and recognise what will help a relationship to further grow , ' the company claims			1
it is billed as the modern way to see if a relationship might have marriage potential ( illustrated )			0

a company in @entity17 , @entity19 , created the kit , to test chemistry between lovers before ' a life - changing commitment is made '
it comprises two biological and one psychological test for cad $ 149 ( £ 81 )
one test determines how two people 's brains process serotonin , another analyses their genetic make - up - all from a cheek swab
the company claims its compatibility test is the first to be backed by scientific and psychological research that can be done at home
