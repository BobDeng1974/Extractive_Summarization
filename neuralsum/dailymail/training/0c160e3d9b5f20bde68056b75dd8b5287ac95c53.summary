we all get a bit grumpy on an empty stomach - but there 's no need to get angry and violent about it			1
but try telling that to these two herons , who were literally at each other 's throats after fighting over a fish			1
the pair were fishing for their supper in the @entity16 area of southern @entity17 and it seems that one may have snatched the tasty catch right out of the other 's mouth			1
and as these pictures , by @entity26 photographer @entity25 show , his friend did n't take to kindly to it			1
that was mine ! this hungry heron gets ready to give its friend a few choice words and well - aimed pecks after missing out on a tasty fish supper angry birds : squaring up eye - to - eye and beak - to - beak , the heron lets rip at the fish thief flying feathers : a third heron nearby ( bottom left ) looks on in astonishment as the other two start fighting @entity25 , 45 , was delighted to capture the hilarious exchange			1
he said : ' i spent a couple of hours photographing the herons , and these two had been standing together looking for fish for a long time			2
' they were obviously getting very hungry , and probably a bit grumpy			0
suddenly , another heron in the group caught a fish , and there was a squabble for it			2
' one of the herons did n't end up getting any of the fish , and was obviously a bit put out			2
' the flock got really angry and quite aggressive , and they stood in silence for a while			0
' then , one of them suddenly approached the other , and went right up into his face			0
' it made me chuckle because he looked so angry - and his friend was taken completely by surprise			1
back off ! the heron looks quite horrified that his friend should take losing a fish so personally and another thing ! the pictures were taken by photographer @entity25 in the @entity16 area of southern @entity17 calm down ! the attacker finally backs off , as the other heron looks on haughtily ' i love photographing the birds , but they are very shy creatures			1
' i have to use a hide when i 'm taking pictures			0
i use a very light hide that is similar to a poncho - it covers just me and the tripod with the camera			0
it is very portable and light			0
' there are so many birds and they 're all different			0
there is a different way to photograph each species and this is very stimulating because you have to take a different approach every time			0
