those who claim @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity3 humiliate their contestants will be foaming at the mouth when they hear about @entity7 's latest prime - time saturday night extravaganza			1
when international illusionist @entity10 introduces an extraordinary new generation game - type tv show tonight , viewers will see what happens when the contestants who are competing to win pots of money are given bizarre instructions under hypnosis			1
they end up doing the most mind - bogglingly embarrassing things – to the extent that while your toes do curl for them , you have to remind yourself that they have willingly volunteered to make fools of themselves			1
hypnotist @entity10 with five contestants on @entity7 's new show you 're back in the room hosted by @entity30 , @entity7 's you 're back in @entity29 pits five hypnotised strangers against each other as they take on apparently simple game - show challenges straight out of @entity35 's 70s heyday , such as making balloon animals and doing impersonations of pop stars			1
the twist that brings it into the 21st century @entity42 - style arena is when @entity10 – who 's already hypnotised them – then sabotages their chances of winning by telling them to do the weirdest things			1
so for example , when a clutch of five contestants is asked to make sculptures out of clay , one is made to believe that the clay is a miracle face cream , while another is certain it smells of dog dirt			2
a third is convinced she really is a mad @entity59 sculptor , a fourth that everyone else 's sculptures are obscene and the final one , when triggered by hearing that famous @entity64 song , believes he 's @entity65 in the amorous pottery scene from the film ghost			2
of course the question of how safe it is to play with the volunteering contestants ' minds like this , and just how humiliating the results are once all inhibitions are removed , is going to make this one of the most controversial shows ever			2
@entity10 , an @entity77 hypnotist and magician who has appeared on stage and tv all over the world and also uses his technique to help people overcome phobias and shyness , admits even he was n't quite sure what would happen			2
@entity87 , with host @entity30 , believes her sculpting clay is face cream after being hypnotised ' they were like greyhounds coming out onto the track , ready to accept any suggestion i gave them , ' he says			1
' but i was a bit worried they might run amok because while @entity30 is on stage at all times , i 'm not			1
so even though the contestants could n't see me i still felt i had a duty of responsibility to keep control over their behaviour			2
' hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination , so while i give instructions to them under hypnosis the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways			1
for example , 60 - year - old contestant @entity115 was a polite and gentle soul off - camera , but after hypnosis i could get her to do anything			1
when she was told to be a frustrated @entity59 sculptor , she got very , very angry			2
@entity30 was shocked ! ' another contestant was asked to throw a pizza off stage			1
her imagination went wild and she threw it over a member of the audience who happened to be beautifully dressed for her birthday celebrations			2
that proves just how spontaneous the show is			1
' every week members of the studio audience who 've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis – and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs			1
then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage			1
' anyone can be put into a trance but everyone has different levels of susceptibility , ' explains @entity10			2
' one studio audience test i did where i got people to imagine their hands are glued together was classic			2
many of them , even the cynical ones , found they could n't pull their hands apart			2
' once we 've picked our five candidates i take them backstage and put them into a deep trance , which takes about 20 minutes			2
first i make sure they shut down their physical bodies by getting them to sit comfortably , focus on their breathing and relax			0
then i get them to imagine they 're at the top of the stairs and to count down , imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they 're walking down , so that by the time they reach the bottom they 've drifted into a calm hypnotic state			1
from there i 'm able to implant suggestions into their minds			0
' @entity10 then brings the contestants round before they emerge onto the stage			0
but they 're still in a waking trance , and although they 're speaking and acting normally in this state , @entity10 only has to say the word ' sleep ' and they instantly nod off			1
at this point he can implant instructions into their minds which will get them to behave totally out of character – and hinder their progress during each round of games			0
' once you 've hypnotised someone once , you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards , ' says @entity10			1
tv chef @entity201 is served dinnerby a hypnotised contestant on the show the instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects			1
one episode involves the contestants serving a champagne dinner to four popular tv chefs – @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity201 and @entity213 – in a supposedly ' posh ' restaurant			0
but once @entity10 suggests ideas into their minds , it quickly turns into more of a dog 's dinner			0
one woman is told she 's lost her expensive ring in the mashed potato , while another participant is convinced the guests are toddlers who need encouragement to eat their food and the girl serving the gravy thinks she 's aboard a ship in rough seas			0
because detailed portrayal of the way @entity10 manages to put the contestants into a state of deep trance is banned under stage hypnosis laws , it naturally begs the question of whether the participants are acting , or at least playing to the gallery			0
@entity10 insists it 's all bona fide			0
' @entity30 was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they would n't normally do			1
after each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything i do is real			1
but putting someone into a deep trance ca n't be shown on tv for legal reasons in case someone does it at home and they do n't have me there to wake them up afterwards			0
' @entity258 , a @entity259 hypnotherapist who treats a range of issues from weight loss to giving up smoking , says , ' people have been using hypnosis to cure themselves and others since ancient @entity268 times			0
@entity269 brought the positive aspects of hypnosis to the forefront with his tv shows in the 1990s			0
he showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety , bed - wetting , losing weight and giving up smoking			1
but the onus is on the therapist to use this technique in accordance with a moral code			0
does this show do that ? that 's not for me to say , it will be up to the viewer to decide			1
lots of people have never seen hypnosis being carried out and may want to investigate more			0
i know of @entity10 but have never met him , but he 's morally bound to make sure no harm comes to anyone taking part			0
' hypnosis should be used to help people and not used to encourage others to laugh at them			0
no one can be forced in their behaviour , under hypnosis they are simply following a suggestion			0
it 's a heightened state of awareness			0
perception at its most open			0
' whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know			1
@entity10 says at the end of each show his final task is to ' de-fry ' , as he calls it , the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness			1
' i remove all the game show suggestions i 've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way , ' he insists			1
then he shows them the footage of what they got up to – and if you want proof of the authenticity of what goes on , married mother @entity87 offers it			0
' i 'm a bubbly person but there 's no way i would normally have been able to do what i did under hypnosis , ' says @entity87 , 30			0
' i was told to fall in love with @entity30			1
i believed i was utterly in love with him and i believed he loved me too			0
i was waiting for him to propose to me any moment			0
meanwhile my husband @entity343 was in the audience and a man next to him , said , ' good grief , can you imagine what her boyfriend will say ? ' @entity343 said , ' that 's my wife ! ' we know we live in an age when people crave to be famous – or even infamous			0
@entity87 , like all the other contestants i spoke to afterwards , said how much she enjoyed the whole experience			0
@entity356 , a 33 - year - old musician who 'd been told he was naked on stage , told me , ' i truly believed i was naked even though i could see i was actually wearing clothes			2
but after the show i felt energised – as if i could accomplish anything			2
' those who believe in self - control will watch with their hands over their eyes but @entity30 , who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to @entity368 , is convinced it will be a hit			1
' it 's absolutely hysterical			0
i had no idea what to expect , but the contestants completely lose their inhibitions under hypnosis			0
i think one of the highlights was @entity87 professing her love for me – you really have to see it to believe it			0
' you 're back in the room , tonight , 8.20pm , @entity7			1
