could it get any worse ? president @entity1 is riding a wave of public disgust with his health insurance overhaul that threatens to put him decidedly into @entity6 territory			1
his latest public approval rating , just 37 per cent , is the lowest measured by a major poll since he took office			0
a month ago , that number was 46 per cent : low but manageable for a president in his second term			2
but the @entity14 's disastrous website launch , and its accompanying millions - strong wave of insurance cancellation letters , appear to have damaged the president more deeply than his administration 's earlier scandals , judging from wednesday 's @entity21 poll numbers			1
that 's because more and more @entity23 either have their own @entity14 horror stories to tell , or have heard them from people they know personally			2
the @entity45 's @entity44 scandal only resonated with the @entity47 's right wing			0
but just as the @entity49 press corps found its aggressive voice when the @entity51 admitted spying on reporters , @entity23 who have been personally touched by @entity14 's ham - fisted rollout are venting their spleens â€“ to pollsters , at least			1
and the pool of disaffected taxpayers is growing			0
compare @entity1 's numbers to those of president @entity61 at the height of public angst over the @entity65 war , and the depth of his @entity68 nightmare becomes clear			1
once promising , @entity1 's historical legacy now seems doomed to feature his flailing health insurance agenda at this point in his presidency , @entity61 's rating was 35 per cent , just two points away from where the foundering @entity1 presidency now sits			1
@entity76 sat at 65 per cent approval in the first november of his second term in office			2
@entity34 's number was 58 at that point			1
no gloating , speaker @entity83 : congressional republicans are faring worse than the president , with just 21 per cent of @entity23 approving of their job performance key constituencies are abandoning @entity1 in droves			1
he has lost ten full percentage points in women 's approval since october , now winning over just 39 per cent of them			1
he has also lost nine points among men , only 34 per cent of whom back his job performance			0
worst of all , @entity1 's support among swing - voting independents has dropped like a rock			2
just 29 per cent of them now say they view his presidency in a positive light , a loss of 12 points since october			0
a month into the national experiment with healthcare.gov , just 1 in 10 @entity23 believe the project is going well			2
two - thirds say it is n't			0
a paltry seven per cent say the @entity14 should be left in place as - is			0
a far larger group , 48 per cent , now want it repealed			0
the rest favor keeping the law with some changes			0
as the president 's coat - tails shorten , democrats in tight 2014 congressional races have begun to walk away from him			0
and @entity119 , the likely @entity36 standard - bearer in 2016 , has used her husband , the former president , to put distance between herself and the current @entity122			0
@entity34 made waves when he said @entity1 should honor his promise to let @entity23 keep their health insurance policies if they wanted to			1
@entity34 's comments started both sides of the political aisle on a sprint to craft a proposal doing just that , and @entity1 himself pre-empted @entity132 with his own announcement last week .			1

@entity1 's approval sits at an all - time - low 37 per cent
fully 48 per cent want the @entity14 repealed
the president has lost nine points since october as the @entity14 *fiasco* has become front - page news
at this point in their presidencies , @entity76 rated 65 per cent positive and @entity34 's number was 58
just 1 in 10 @entity23 say the health insurance rollout is going well
