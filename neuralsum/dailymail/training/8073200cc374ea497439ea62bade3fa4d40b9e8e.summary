by @entity1 reporter published : 09:37 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 10:40 est , 31 august 2012 @entity3 prosecutors have sparked outrage after charging 270 miners with the murders of 34 of their striking colleagues who were shot dead by police			1
the mass killing of the strikers at the marikana mine this month was one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994			0
and now the arrested miners have been charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a ' common purpose ' in the murder of their co-workers			1
president @entity55 has seen his support erode , with his enemies saying he is more interested in getting close to industry and powerful labour groups than miners working deep underground			2
@entity55 , speaking at a congress of the @entity63 on friday , did not comment on the murder charges			0
his justice minister , @entity65 , has demanded an explanation			1
taking cover : protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer			2
more than 30 people are reported to have been killed surrounded : police form an armed cordon around strikers			0
it is unclear whether these miners are injured or lying down for officers to conduct searches at the centre of violence : the @entity82 mine , near @entity38 , 100km north - west of @entity83 , where around 3,000 miners walked out on august 10 over wages			2
since then there have been serveal fatal incidents under pressure : president @entity55 ' there is no doubt that the decision has induced a sense of shock , panic and confusion within the members of the community and the general @entity3 public			2
it is therefore incumbent upon me to seek clarity , ' he said in a statement			0
prosecutors on thursday charged the 270 miners , already under arrest on suspicion of murder in a earlier shooting at the mine , with the august 16 murder of 34 co-workers at the marikana mine of the world 's third biggest platinum producer , @entity82			2
the 34 were shot in a hail of police bullets in what has been dubbed the ' @entity117 ' with videos of the killings broadcast worldwide			0
police will not be subject to punishment until the conclusion of a government probe early next year			2
common purpose was often used by the apartheid government against blacks to sentence numerous people for crimes committed by only a few			1
@entity130 , a former @entity46 cabinet minister and now leader of the @entity133 opposition party , was imprisoned during apartheid in a case where the common purpose doctrine was invoked			1
he said the decision to charge the miners was a setback for democracy			2
@entity55 is facing re-election as the @entity46 's leader in december and poor management of the shooting would strengthen his opponents who see him as running an ineffectual government			1
he has ordered an investigation into the responsibility of police , @entity82 and the feuding unions that caused the strike at @entity152			0
the panel 's report is due a month after the @entity46 vote			1
@entity55 has made little progress on his main policies since taking office in 2009 , with unemployment increasing , corruption perceived to be getting worse and the gap between rich and poor - already among the worst in the world - growing wider			0
many striking miners have avoided pointing fingers at @entity55 so far , preferring to criticise @entity82 and the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) for not doing enough to help them			0
violence : a mine worker is pictured licking his spear at @entity152 platinum mine in @entity3 , where police opened fire on striking miners armed with machetes and sticks bloody scenes : a police spokesman has confirmed that at least 30 were killed in the shooting on thursday - one of the worst in @entity3 since the end of the apartheid era ' i blame the management of the company			1
they are the ones who called out the police			0
@entity165 is too busy with politics to help us , ' said @entity190 , a striking miner			0
but trouble with the @entity165 could taint @entity55 and the @entity46 , where many of the union 's former leaders have taken up senior positions in the ruling party			1
legal experts said the charges will likely collapse when a court hears bail applications for the 270 next week			0
they see the move as a clumsy tactic to prolong the miners ' incarceration that is only making an already tense situation worse			1
sticks and stones versus bullets : miners can be seen between police vehicles throwing rocks at officers			0
victims on both sides have been killed in recent days gun battle : in the heat of the incident , dust flies and police take cover			0
water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire police are facing pressure on a related front			1
the @entity229 , a government watchdog , said it had received nearly 200 complaints from the arrested miners who said they had been assaulted and abused while in custody			1
prosecutors said they invoked the ' common purpose ' measure because the miners were at the scene with weapons and therefore complicit in the killings			0
members of the government 's @entity241 questioned if prosecutors knew the law			1
' it seems unthinkable that @entity3 now with this fantastic new democracy and @entity249 , that the agents of the state are relying the remnants of apartheid brutality , ' said @entity252 , associate professor at @entity254 's @entity253			1

*controversial* law was used by apartheid government against blacks
critics condemn move as clumsy tactic to prolong the miners ' incarceration
