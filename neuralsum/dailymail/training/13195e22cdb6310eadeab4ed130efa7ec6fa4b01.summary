one in five travellers is not counted in and out of @entity1 or checked against terror and criminal watchlists			1
catastrophic it failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers escape full screening every year			1
launched seven years ago by @entity10 , the @entity9 system was supposed to log every journey to and from the @entity1			1
despite the huge outlay , only 80 per cent of trips are being logged by what remains of the @entity9 programme			2
six million people arriving by train – which includes @entity31 – do not undergo advance checks			1
only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged – the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics			1
failings : six million people arriving by train - which includes @entity31 - do not undergo advance checks unchecked : only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged - the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics even though airport coverage is 95 per cent , almost four million people still arrive every year without having their details checked			1
the failings mean officials are denied the full use of a vital weapon in the fight against terrorism			0
sir @entity56 , who runs the @entity57 , has told mps that – when it works – the @entity9 system ‘ provides extremely valuable information to the intelligence services and to the police ’			1
the system , however , is unable to fully count people in and out , leaving officials in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration			1
mps on the @entity69 home affairs select committee last night vowed to reinvestigate the shambles			0
@entity74 mp @entity73 said : ‘ this is an absolute disgrace			0
@entity9 is a fantastic tool to stop illegal immigrants , dangerous criminals and terrorists coming into the country			0
vital : sir @entity56 ( left ) , who runs the @entity57 , has told @entity68 that the @entity9 system ' provides extremely valuable information to the intelligence services and to the police ' , but @entity74 mp @entity73 ( right ) has branded it ' an absolute disgrace ' ‘ it ’s been up and running successfully in @entity86 and @entity87 for years			1
but because of the absolutely disastrous , catastrophic contract the last @entity10 government entered into , we have not got it			0
’ when the full plans for eborders were drawn up in 2007 @entity10 ministers promised to ‘ export the border ’ to other countries by forcing anyone trying to get into @entity1 to reveal their personal information in advance			1
passed on by carriers , it is then checked against watchlists and security databases and logged on a vast database			2
extremists , criminals and wanted criminals could either be arrested at the airport or turned away			0
alternatively , they can be put under surveillance to identify terrorist plots			0
by the end of 2013 , 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by the system			2
this was expected to rise to 100 per cent by early this year			0
but , from the outset , the system turned into a shambles			0
it was delayed by @entity119 countries refusing to participate on the grounds that it breached @entity123 directives , including on data protection			0
arrivals : even though airport coverage is 95 per cent , almost four million people still arrive every year without having their details checked scheme : by the end of 2013 , 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by @entity9 system there are still six airlines on the continent refusing to participate , sir @entity56 recently told mps			1
in a devastating report , @entity139 , the chief inspector of borders , warned the ‘ electronic borders ’ project had descended into a shambles			0
technical problems mean people arriving on ferries , @entity31 trains , cruise ships and small planes are not screened in advance			1
and , even when known criminals and illegals are flagged by the system , airports may not be phoned in advance to warn about their impending arrival			2
last night a @entity159 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity1 ’s border security is among the toughest in the world and @entity162 is just one of a number of checks we carry out			2
‎ this includes carrying out passport checks on everybody arriving in the @entity1			2
‘ new powers in the @entity171 will enable carrier and port operator staff to play a role in carrying out these embarkation checks to improve our already robust security at the border			0
