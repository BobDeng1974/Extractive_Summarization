@entity0 has been forced to apologise to a family after their flight home from @entity5 was delayed by 54 hours and they were put up in a ' disgusting ' hotel			1
@entity8 , 32 , of @entity9 , was returning from a week - long holiday in @entity11 with her mum , @entity13 , 55 , and auntie , @entity15 , 60 , at a picturesque seaside resort			1
the trio had paid £ 296 each for an all - inclusive stay at the three - star @entity20 to celebrate @entity13 's 55th birthday			2
@entity8 , 32 , of @entity9 , was delayed 56 hours in @entity11 and put up in a ' disgusting ' hotel but their trip home turned sour after their initial return flight to @entity29 was delayed on friday , october 24			1
they were eventually taken to the @entity31 at 5am the following day and told to return to the airport at 9am for a replacement flight			2
@entity8 was on holiday with her mother @entity35 ( left ) and auntie @entity15 ( right ) however , after three hours sleep , the family returned to the airport only for their second flight to be cancelled , forcing them to spend another night at the hotel			1
unhappy with the standard of the accommodation , @entity8 took photos showing exposed wires , dirty marks on the floor and windowsill , and a filthy bathroom			2
the holidaymaker said she found bed bugs on the mattress and flies over the floor , as well as a toilet which leaked every time it was flushed			0
they were returned to the airport at 9am on the sunday and eventually arrived back in the @entity60 at 4pm that afternoon			0
the flight delays , blamed on the combination of a broken - down plane and poor weather conditions , meant it took the family 54 hours to fly home			1
on friday , single mum - of - two and carer @entity8 slammed @entity0 for putting them up in a dirty hotel while other travellers were taken to a four - star resort			1
she said the unsavoury end to their trip made it a holiday from hell			2
' i am angry at how we were treated			0
i came back in tears , ' she said			0
' the holiday was completely ruined by those last days			2
we went together to celebrate mum 's birthday so it was important that we had a nice time			2
' over those two days i was frustrated and tired so i ca n't imagine how the people with kids felt			0
we were n't looked after properly and treated the way customers should be			0
' the hotel they took us to was n't even a @entity0 hotel			1
there were bugs in the bed and there were flies all over the floor			0
' the bed sheets were wet and you could n't turn the air - con off cold			0
they also stank like they had n't been washed for years			0
your feet stuck to the floor and when you flushed the toilet the water was coming out of the bottom			0
' we had no toiletries left so we could n't shower and when we asked the staff they pointed at other hotel guests and told us to ask them so we had to scrounge			0
a dirty pipe ( left ) in the room and the view from the @entity31 , where they were put up by @entity0 ' it was disgusting			1
i kept crying my eyes out			0
every time we asked for something the hotel staff either said " no " or that they could n't speak @entity127			0
you could n't get any help			0
' when they arrived at the airport on sunday @entity8 said fellow travellers were comparing notes and photos from a different hotel they were sent to and saying ' what a brilliant time they had '			1
' i want an apology from @entity0			2
they did n't look after our well - being at all			0
it was a real holiday from hell , ' @entity8 said			1
@entity8 's mum , @entity13 , from @entity144 , @entity145 , who suffers from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , added : ' i still feel stressed thinking about what happened			1
i have been on holiday with @entity0 for 20 years and never had a bad experience			1
@entity8 took these images of exposed wires ( left ) and a power socket that is detached from the wall ' we had such a good time until the flight was delayed and we were taken to a filthy hotel			1
i 've never been treated like that before			0
' holidaymakers are entitled to receive between £ 200 and £ 480 compensation for flight delays of at least three hours in countries within the @entity164			2
the ruling follows a landmark legal victory by former teacher @entity167 , who took @entity0 to court over a 22 - hour flight delay in @entity169			1
@entity8 ( centre ) with @entity13 ( left ) and @entity171 ( right ) during their holiday why but @entity8 , @entity13 and @entity171 , from @entity174 , @entity145 , have been told they will have to wait at least a month before finding out about their compensation claim			1
@entity0 has now apologised to all customers affected by the flight delays			1
a spokesperson for @entity181 said : ' we ’d like to sincerely apologise to our customers for the long delay to their flight from @entity11 to @entity29 , which was caused by an unexpected technical fault , after a diversion due to bad weather , which required repair overnight in @entity5			1
the @entity31 , which @entity8 complained was below her expectations ' we provided welfare and hotel rooms overnight for our customers			1
we know how frustrating these delays are , and we ’d like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding			0
” ' we ’d also like to apologise further to those customers that were moved from their hotel during the day on the 25th october – we have worked hard to ensure that they had suitable overnight accommodation for the evening of saturday 25th october prior to their departure on the sunday			0
