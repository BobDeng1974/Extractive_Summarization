during the absence of daylight cues , migrants have been , surprisingly , seen flying in the expected southerly direction			0
it ’s been suggested they use geomagnetic cues to help navigate when day light cues are unavailable to them during migration			0
tests in the simulator revealed that the butterflies used the inclination angle of @entity94 ’s magnetic field to guide their movement			0
' this is the time when they are easier to approach and i could get as close as possible without spooking them			0
' each of the butterflies are adults , varying in size from three to seven centimetres when measured from their heads to their tails			0
