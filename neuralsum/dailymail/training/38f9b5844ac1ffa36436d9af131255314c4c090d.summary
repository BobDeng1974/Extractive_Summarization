the @entity10 rocket launched at 1.02pm est ( 6.02pm gmt ) from the @entity11 along @entity4 's central coast			1
@entity13 said the protective nose cone around the @entity16 satellite had separated and fallen away from the rocket as planned			2
the @entity16 satellite is the eighth of its kind to be launched since 1972 to track glaciers , forest fires , crop production and coastlines			0
a @entity13 spokesman said : ' the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is the future of @entity16 satellites			2
it will continue to obtain valuable data and imagery to be used in agriculture , education , business , science , and government			0
' @entity28 will join the aging @entity40 and @entity16 7 satellites in orbit and continue to produce stunning pictures of @entity45 ’s surface along with a wealth of scientific data			0
preparations : a rocket carrying an earth observation satellite is scheduled to blast off from the @entity4 coast today on a mission to keep a continuous eye on the planet 's resources vital : a @entity13 spokesman said : ' the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is the future of @entity16 satellites			1
it will continue to obtain valuable data and imagery ' preparations : a truck moves the first stage booster of a @entity85 to @entity86 at @entity11 in october @entity28 will measure @entity45 ’s surfaces in the visible , near - infrared , short wave infrared and thermal infrared , with a moderate - resolution of 15 to 100 meters , depending on spectral frequency			2
for four decades , @entity13 's @entity16 satellites have looked down on @entity45 - monitoring natural disasters , watching cities such as @entity95 expand and watching resources such as water			1
the satellites images have provided critical data on human population growth and changes in the planet , including the first ' full ' images of @entity104			0

last year @entity13 said , ' this continues the @entity16 ’s critical role in monitoring , understanding and managing the resources needed for human sustainment such as food , water and forests			2
' as our population surpasses seven billion people , the impact of human society on the planet will increase , and @entity16 monitors those impacts as well as environmental changes			0
' with the longest unbroken data stream of @entity45 ’s surface as seen from space , @entity13 ’s @entity45 - observing @entity16 fleet has provided the world with unprecedented information on land cover changes and their residual effects since 1972			0
