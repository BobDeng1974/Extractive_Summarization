by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 5 july 2013 @entity3 countries were told that @entity5 whistleblower @entity4 was aboard the plane of @entity8 president @entity7 which was diverted to @entity9 , @entity1 claims			1
according to @entity1 's foreign minister the information was ' clear ' that @entity4 was inside the plane , which was grounded and searched last week			2
@entity13 did not reveal who supplied the information , but said the decision to force the @entity8 presidential plane to make a u-turn over @entity3 was based on the information			2
his plane 's route is pictured flight ban : mr @entity7 had come under suspicion of harbouring @entity23 fugitive @entity4 ( pictured inset ) on board his flight from @entity34 ' they told us that the information was clear , that he was inside , ' @entity13 said friday on @entity38			1
meanwhile , @entity8 president @entity7 is threatening to close the @entity23 embassy in @entity24 after the incident			1
his warning comes after his plane was forced to make a u-turn over @entity3 on tuesday after he was apparently barred from flying through @entity46 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity1 airspace following suspicions that @entity23 fugitive @entity4 was on board			1
mr @entity7 has since blamed the @entity23 government for pressurising the @entity3 countries into the ban , which has caused a diplomatic furore			1
grounded : the @entity8 presidential airplane is parked at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity9 , on tuesday no asylum : @entity58 appears to be losing patience with @entity5 whistleblower @entity4 according to the @entity60 , mr @entity7 said : ' my hand would not shake to close the @entity23 embassy			1
' we have dignity , sovereignty			0
without the @entity23 , we are better politically and democratically			0
' reports claimed @entity69 's flight was brought down because there were suggestions that @entity23 @entity5 ( @entity5 ) leaker , @entity4 , was on board , after the @entity8 president said casually in @entity34 that if @entity4 was to apply for asylum , his case would be considered			1
@entity58 meanwhile appeared to be losing patience with former @entity23 spy agency contractor @entity4 's stay in the country			2
deputy foreign minister @entity81 said that the country had received no official request for political asylum and that @entity4 has to solve his own problems			0
he has spent 11 days in the transit area of @entity34 's @entity86 since arriving from @entity87			0
holed up : @entity4 has been at @entity34 's @entity86 for 11 days although @entity58 president @entity89 has refused to extradite @entity4 and @entity58 officials have apparently delighted in him evading capture by the @entity23 , it seems he is becoming increasingly unwelcome there			1
mr @entity81 told @entity93 : ' he needs to choose a place to go			0
' as of this moment , we do not have a formal application from mr @entity4 asking for asylum in the @entity58			0
' @entity89 has also urged him to leave as soon as he can			0
he will only grant @entity4 , 30 , asylum if he agrees to stop actions that could harm the @entity23 - a condition that saw @entity4 withdraw his application			0
@entity46 and @entity45 have also turned down requests from @entity4 for asylum say @entity93			0
although @entity23 and @entity58 relationsions have been somewhat strained since @entity89 returned to power , the two nations are said to be talking every day about the @entity4 issue .			2

@entity1 claims @entity3 countries were told @entity4 was on @entity69 plane
@entity8 president 's plane was grounded in @entity9 on tuesday
@entity7 has since threatened to close the @entity23 embassy in @entity8
@entity69 had apparently been banned from airspace over much of @entity3

@entity58 has said it is growing increasingly *frustrated* with @entity4
the @entity5 whistleblower has been holed up in an airport outside @entity34
