' @entity3 , now 54 , had to be rescued by firefighters from the bathroom floor at her doctor 's surgery after falling moments after an appointment where she discovered her weight had ballooned to 41 stone having battled her weight for a decade , the nightclub owner from @entity35 , made the decision to lose weight once and for all after falling again , 10 years later on her driveway			1
she took an hour to crawl to her front door			1
after revolutionising her diet , ms @entity3 has shed almost 20 stone the nightclub owner from @entity35 , @entity42 , said she had always been overweight			1
' the lifestyle was a lot of drink and greasy food , ' she added			1
' when the club shut i always stopped at @entity49 for a quarter pounder with extra cheese			2
' but gradually i began to wonder what sort of toll it was taking on my body			2
' i loved to dance the night away but it was n't as easy as it once had been			0
' ms @entity3 went to see her doctor in the early 2000s , and for the first time stepped on the scales			1
she said : ' they had to get the freight scale they used for weighing packages , i could n't believe it			1
' i was amazed but it was n't that much of a shock			0
' my size 66 jeans would n't do up anymore			0
when i could n't do up my size 66 jeans , i just bought a bigger size and another			0
i had to order all my clothes online			0
' while everyone knew me as fun - loving , party girl @entity73 , but i was sick of being heavy			1
ms @entity3 asked her doctor if she could be referred for a gastric bypass operation , but was refused because it was deemed too dangerous at the time during the early 2000s , when the surgery was not routinely offered			1
' on my way out the surgery , i went to the loo , ' she said			0
' when i locked the door , i slipped and fell			1
' she was unable to get up , or get out of the way so anyone else could get in			0
' i desperately tried to pull myself back onto my feet , ' she recalled			0
' but each time my huge arms failed my mammoth weight			1
my chunky legs buckled beneath my huge frame			0
' after half an hour , the surgery called the fire brigade			2
five firefighters managed to break in and get me out			2
' i felt so ashamed			2
' ms @entity3 managed to cheat a gastric band operation , gradually learning to eat more and ballooning in size again within five years			1
by 2010 , having had the surgery in the early 2000s , she weighed 35 stone once again as a result her doctor agreed to refer ms @entity3 for surgery			1
the operation took place a few months later , and was a success			0
in just a year , ms @entity3 lost more than 20 stone			1
' friends barely recognised me and i felt fabulous , ' she said			0

' it was 2005 and the beginning of a slippery slope			0
ms @entity3 reverted to her previous unhealthy diet , and began to pile the weight back on			1
by 2010 she weighed 35 stone again			1
she said : ' i 've stared every discrimination in the eye and vanquished it			0
i 've completely turned my life around ' ' i felt miserable , ' she added			0
' but i did n't do anything about it			0
' ' big portions no longer made my stomach ache , ' she admitted			0
' so i started downing loads of sickly sweet spirits and mixers and greasy burgers			0
' but as i put on weight i lost my hope and passion			2
' but it was n't until the following year that another fall was to prove the turning point			2
while walking up her driveway , ms @entity3 slipped and fell			1
' i was so hefty , i could n't move , ' she said			0
' i felt like a beached whale and because i was so ashamed i did n't call for anyone to help me			2
' instead i crawled to the front door myself			1
' what should have taken a few moments , took ms @entity3 an hour			1
' i was so exhausted i slept on the hall floor for an hour , ' she said			2
' but i knew this was my lowest point			1
' i was petrified about my health			0
i was scared i 'd die if i carried on eating and drinking as i had			2
' if i wanted to change , then i had to do it myself			0
' ms @entity3 gave her diet a massive overhaul , ditching the junk food and alcohol in favour of salads and diet drinks			1
' it has n't been easy , ' she said			0
' but i am moving in the right direction			0
i 'm now 20 stone and i have so much more energy			2
i 'm half the woman i used to be but i 've never felt more whole			0

she finished : ' i 've quit drinking completely , which was difficult because i still owned a bar			0
' i 've gone back to college			0
i 've stared every discrimination in the eye and vanquished it			0
' i 've completely turned my life around			0
