@entity0 is the classic enigma			2
one of the world 's best when he 's in the mood , but infuriating to watch as he fluctuates in and out of on - the - field strops			0
@entity6 says @entity8 's £ 16million purchase of the striker as a ' calculated risk ' , but highlighted @entity0 's goalscoring record			1
his stats are indeed impressive , but there is far more to look into when evaluating a player like @entity0			2
here , @entity15 looks at the most intriguing numbers of the @entity18 's latest hitman			2
@entity0 scored just 14 goals from 152 shots , a conversion rate of 13.3 per cent			1
misfire : @entity0 's goal conversion rate in the @entity51 last season was the worst in @entity46 @entity63 assists 9 chances created 84 @entity30 assists 1 chances created 37 @entity24 assists 6 chances created 52 just one assist in 54 @entity18 appearances for @entity30 arriving as a 19 - year - old with quite an ego , it was clear from the start that @entity75 would struggle to handle his former @entity63 protege in @entity77			1
not one for team spirit , @entity0 was credited with just one spirit during his stay at the @entity81			0
mind you , it could n't have been more crucial			0
the striker 's through ball found @entity86 in 2012 against @entity87 , with the @entity88 firing home in stoppage time to secure the @entity18 title			2
some time to get that assist : @entity0 set up @entity86 's crucial winner against @entity87 in 2012 @entity0 at @entity30 150 @entity0 in @entity49 146.8 @entity18 ... minimum 45 goals 1 ) @entity86 120 2 ) @entity96 122 6 ) @entity97 146.9 @entity0 's minutes - per - goal ratio in @entity49 is up there with the very best @entity86 's goal in @entity30 's 3 - 1 win against @entity8 on monday night put him at the top of the charts for impact in the @entity18			1
among those on the list of minutes - per - goals was @entity97 , the league 's record goalscorer , with 147 minutes per goal			1
credit to @entity0 , his ratio in @entity49 is 146.7			1
there 's no doubting he makes an impression			0
plus side : @entity0 's minutes per goal ratio was superb at @entity30 and in @entity49 one of the best : but @entity0 's @entity51 recird was better than @entity97 's in the @entity18 @entity0 in @entity77 fouls committed 93 yellow cards 12 red cards 3 @entity0 in @entity49 fouls made 256 yellow cards 33 red cards 1 three red cards in the @entity18 , one in @entity51 what is it with @entity0 and @entity77 ? @entity0 was never sent off at @entity63 as a youngster , and was dismissed just once with @entity24			1
but with @entity30 , the @entity49 was sent off three times			0
he clashed with @entity129 against @entity130 , and was dismissed for two bookable offences in crucial away games against @entity8 and @entity133			0
so that 's what @entity6 means about that calculated risk ... poor record : @entity0 racked up three red cards in the @entity18 ... he had just one in @entity51 11 yellow cards in @entity51 last season , just two for fouls @entity142 , strops and scuffles are three words that best describe @entity0 's attitude in @entity49			1
manager 's often defend @entity0 's temper , and it 's true he rarely sets into a tackle looking to hurt the opposing player			0
but there 's only so much a referee will put up with			0
defenders know they can wind up the striker , and bookings often follow			0
youngster : @entity0 was raw potential at @entity63 , but backed up his talent on the pitch bench life : the @entity49 had to get used to becoming an impact sub at @entity30			2

@entity8 sign @entity0 from @entity24 for £ 16million
the striker has been described as a ' calculated risk ' by @entity6
@entity0 had lowest shot conversion rate in @entity46 last season
better minutes - per - goals ratio in @entity49 than @entity97 in @entity18
three red cards in @entity77 , just one in @entity49
