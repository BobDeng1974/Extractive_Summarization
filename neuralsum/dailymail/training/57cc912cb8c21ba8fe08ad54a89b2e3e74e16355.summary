@entity0 take on @entity2 opponents for the first time on tuesday when @entity4 visit @entity5			1
the @entity6 – held 1 - 1 by @entity7 in their last home outing – can not afford another slip - up if they ’re to enjoy a smooth passage into the knockout phase of the @entity12			1
so who are the visitors from the former @entity14 ? @entity15 brings you more … first things first , a bit of history ? @entity4 's @entity20 ( right ) takes on @entity22 's @entity21 in the @entity12 back in 1999 in recent times they have been the dominant force of @entity2 football and are currently defending what would be a fifth straight title			2
they were only formed in 1960 in the wake of @entity31 ’s closure			0
@entity32 were another club from @entity4 who were accused of poisoning their opponents ahead of a playoff match and were subsequently disbanded			2
the newly - formed club survived a bribery scandal in the early @entity40 – for which they were relegated to the @entity14 third division – and following independence won the first @entity43 in 1992			0
twelve titles and seven more cups have followed , as has participation in the @entity12 , this season ’s entry being their second in the competition ’s group stages			0
so how are they faring this season ? @entity54 , son of @entity2 football legend @entity55 , has been in great form for @entity4 this season they are six points off top in third position but have a game in hand over leaders @entity63 and remain strong favourites to take the title , although they were beaten 2 - 1 at home to @entity68 on saturday in what was a shock result			1
they do , though , boast the league ’s top scorer in the form of eight - goal @entity54			1
@entity54 ? i recognise that name … yes , the 18 - year - old is the son of @entity2 ’s greatest - ever player and record goalscorer , @entity55 , who is now the director of football at @entity4 , his hometown club			1
@entity54 was born in @entity80 during his father ’s playing career in the country and joined @entity85 ’s youth ranks before moving to @entity4 as a teenager			2
he is now a @entity2 youth international but qualifies to play for @entity87 and is fluent in @entity2 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
@entity2 's @entity91 celebrates scoring against @entity92 at @entity93 in @entity94 who else should we look out for ? @entity98 striker @entity97 is a club legend			1
the captain has scored 121 goals in eight seasons with @entity4 and became the club ’s record marksman in may			2
he is skilful and daring and is the one to watch , for sure			0
@entity4 's @entity98 striker @entity97 has scored 121 goals in eight seasons with the @entity2 who is the boss ? @entity108 was assistant to @entity109 – the current @entity110 boss – for three seasons before taking the reins himself in 2013			1
he was a player back in 1999 when @entity4 made it to the @entity12 group stages and finished bottom after picking up four points from @entity22 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
@entity4 's @entity2 manager @entity108 speaks to the press before his side 's clash with @entity0 @entity110 boss @entity109 spent five seasons in charge of @entity4 before leaving for @entity124 what can we expect from them ? they ’ll be well organised and compact with @entity97 probably operating as a lone striker			1
they ’ve forced two draws against @entity7 and @entity131 and beat @entity132 to reach the group stages			0
they ’ll try to frustrate @entity0 in the hope that @entity136 – or perhaps @entity54 from the bench – can nick a goal			0
but given the disparity in quality of the two squads , the hosts should run out easy winners .			0

@entity0 take on @entity2 opponents for the first time
the @entity6 were held to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity7 in their last outing
@entity4 are strong favourites to win @entity2 @entity152 title
