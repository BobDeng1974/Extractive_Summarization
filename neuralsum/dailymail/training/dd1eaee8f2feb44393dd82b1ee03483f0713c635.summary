by @entity0 pope @entity1 and his predecessor @entity2 embraced today in a historic meeting of two popes at @entity5			1
the men met on the helipad at the papal summer retreat , before praying together in the chapel			0
@entity2 offered @entity1 the kneeler traditionally used by the pope when he prays			1
but @entity1 refused to take it alone , saying ' we 're brothers ' , and the two used a different kneeler in the pews and prayed together , side - by - side			0
today 's meeting is the first between two popes in more than 600 years as the @entity36 finds itself in the unusual position of having two alive at the same time			0
traveling from the helipad to the palazzo , @entity1 sat on the right - hand side of the car , the traditional place of the pope , while @entity2 sat on the left			1
@entity1 brought a gift to @entity2 , an icon of the @entity46 , and told him that it is known as the ' @entity47			2
' ' i thought of you , ' @entity1 told him as he presented the gift			0
' you gave us so many signs of humility and gentleness in your pontificate			0
' @entity2 replied : ' @entity56 , grazie			0
' @entity58 spokesman rev. @entity57 said he understands @entity2 reiterated his pledge of obedience to the new pope , while @entity1 thanked @entity2 for his ministry			1
he said they both wore white , though @entity2 was in a simple cassock and a quilted white jacket without the traditional sash and cape worn by @entity1			1
walking with a cane , he looked frail compared to the robust 76 - year - old @entity69			0
outside the villa , the main piazza of @entity5 was packed with well - wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of history as the two popes broke bread together and presumably discussed the future of the @entity36			0
they chanted ' @entity79 ! @entity79			0
' @entity2 has been living at the papal summer villa since he officially retired on february 28 , the first pope to step down in 600 years			2
he has said he plans to live out his final years in prayer and remain ' hidden from the world			0
' the @entity58 is downplaying the lunch in keeping with @entity2 's desire to remain in private and not interfere with his successor 's papacy			1
the men spoke privately for 45 minutes before sharing a meal with the two papal secretaries			0
the two men both wore the white robes of the papacy , but @entity2 chose a cassock and quilted jacket , leaving the cape and sash to @entity1 the @entity58 press office issued photographs of the pair praying together and exchanging gifts before they were left to speak privately there was to be no live coverage of the private meeting , only a few still photos from the official @entity108 photographer			1
the @entity58 said @entity2 was at the helipad in the villa gardens to welcome @entity1 , and that the two were meeting in @entity2 's library and having lunch together			1
@entity1 will then return to the @entity58 later today , where crowds were gathering in @entity115 ahead of the @entity117 mass tomorrow and @entity118 leading up to @entity119			2
earlier , he flew to the town on an @entity123 @entity122 helicopter in scenes reminiscent of the night @entity2 officially retired from the @entity36			2
the @entity58 spokesman said they would issue a general comment about the meeting but will not be giving a detailed account			0
@entity2 's resignation paved the way for the first pope from @entity132 , the first @entity133 , and the first to call himself @entity1 after the 13th century friar who devoted himself to the poor , nature and working for peace			2
there was speculation that the two popes may discuss the big issues facing the church : the rise of secularism in the world , the drop in priestly vocations in @entity145 , the competition that the @entity36 faces in @entity132 and @entity147 from evangelical @entity149 movements			0
@entity2 left a host of unfinished business on @entity1 ' plate , including the outcome of a top - secret investigation into the leaks of papal documents last year			2
@entity1 may want to sound @entity2 out on his ideas for management changes in the @entity58 administration , a priority given the dysfunctional government he has inherited			1
after their private chat , @entity1 and @entity2 were joined for lunch by the two papal secretaries after their private chat , @entity1 and @entity2 were joined for lunch by the two papal secretaries an @entity69 flag waved outside the papal summer residence today as crowds awaited @entity1 's arrival @entity58 spokesman father @entity57 spoke to the media in the piazza to report on the @entity179 ' meeting then over coffee , they may discuss the future of monsignor @entity183 , @entity2 's trusted aide who has had the task of escorting his old pope into retirement and then returning to the @entity58 to serve his successor in the initial rites of the office			1
@entity183 , who wept as he and @entity2 made their goodbyes to staff in the papal apartment on february 28 , has appeared visibly upset and withdrawn at times as he has been by @entity1 ' side			0
the @entity58 has said @entity1 's primary secretary will be monsignor @entity196 , who had been the no. 2 secretary under @entity2			1
a nun holds a small statue of the @entity22 as they wait outside the villa in @entity5 the helicopter with @entity1 on board flew over @entity202 earlier on its way to @entity5 , in scenes reminiscent of the night @entity2 resigned @entity1 visited @entity2 at @entity5 today , where the former pope blessed crowds from the balcony as he appeared in public view for the last time on the evening of february 28 pope @entity1 was inaugurated on tuesday and led his first mass as pontiff in @entity115 in the @entity58 a week before the inauguration , the former cardinal @entity1 appeared on the balcony of the @entity58 's @entity213 after his election was announced @entity2 's resignation and the emeritus pope 's personal choices about his future have raised the question of how the @entity36 will deal with the unusual situation of having one reigning and one retired pope living side - by - side , each of them called ' pope ' , each of them wearing papal white and even sharing the same aide in @entity224			1
after a few months in @entity5 , @entity2 is to return to the @entity58 to live in a converted monastery in the @entity108 gardens , just a short walk from @entity202 and the shrine devoted to the @entity46 where @entity1 went to pray on one of his first walks as pope .			1

@entity1 flew to @entity5 where the retired pope is staying
the @entity58 said the pair would lunch together before @entity1 left today
both men wore the white of the papacy , with @entity2 in a simple cassock
