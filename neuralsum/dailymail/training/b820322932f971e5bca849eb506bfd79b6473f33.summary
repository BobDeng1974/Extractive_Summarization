the now - dead subject of an @entity2 - nominated film is causing an argument - and it is not about whether the documentary about her will win			0
a messy legal fight over who owns the rights to photos shot by @entity12 nanny @entity11 is raging and the copyright battle threatens to slow , or even stop , new releases of her once - unknown work			1
@entity11 , whose life is chronicled in @entity2 nominee ' finding @entity11 , ' died penniless five years ago			1
@entity11 's intimate and often - gritty photography , which she made no attempt to sell commercially in her lifetime , focused on everyday people			2
since interest in her work exploded , prints of her photographs have sold for thousands of dollars			1
now , two men @entity11 never knew are tussling over who holds the rights to print , sell and display the images she created			1
center stage in the dispute is @entity26 , a 33 - year - old former @entity12 real estate agent who features in and co-directs the documentary			1
he bought a box full of @entity11 's negatives at auction for $ 400 from a repossessed storage locker in 2007			2
@entity26 now owns the vast majority of her work , more than 100,000 images , that are mostly in negatives or undeveloped film			2
he traced @entity11 's whereabouts in the @entity12 area in 2009 , just days after she died at age 83			1
@entity26 defends his project — now his full - time job — of managing his @entity11 collection			1

the documentary about @entity11 is up for an @entity2 on sunday @entity26 ( center ) said the photos are ' a blessing and a curse ' and his life is ' 100 per cent on this project ' it was @entity91 - based @entity90 , a longtime commercial photographer who read about @entity11 as he completed a law degree , who sparked the legal fight by filing a notice in a @entity12 probate court last summer			1
deal 's filing identifies a relative of @entity11 's in @entity100 , retired bureaucrat @entity101 , as @entity11 's closest relative — a first cousin once removed			2

@entity26 believes he has copyrights because a different @entity106 he contends is @entity11 's closest relative , @entity106 , signed over the rights to him			1
deal argues that @entity26 should have launched probate proceedings himself years earlier to establish who @entity11 's heirs were			1
he says it is @entity26 's own fault @entity11 's growing ranks of fans could be deprived of much of her work			1
@entity90 said : ' we would n't be in this position today if he 'd not cut legal corners			0
