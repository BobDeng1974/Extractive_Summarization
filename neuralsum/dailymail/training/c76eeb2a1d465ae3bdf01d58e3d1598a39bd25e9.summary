that ’s the promise from @entity14 - built technology @entity12			1
the @entity12 tracker costs $ 99 ( £ 59 ) and uses infrared light sensors to locate features of a viewer ’s eyes			1
software can then take an accurate guess where they are looking , also known as the point of gaze , and move the mouse cursor to the relevant point on the screen			2

software can then take an accurate guess where they are looking , also known as the point of gaze , and move the mouse cursor to that point on the screen , pictured @entity12 uses infrared illumination sensors to locate the features of a person ’s eyes			1
it then uses an advanced mathematical formula to determine their point of gaze			2
the @entity12 can be calibrated to pick up 9 , 12 or 16 points on each eye and works up to a distance of between 17 and 29 inches			1
the current tracker can be fitted to pcs and @entity47 tablets			0
the firm has also now made the technology available to @entity51 developers			1
the current tracker can be fitted to computer monitors and @entity47 tablets			0
the firm has also now made the technology available to @entity51 developers for the first time			1
to install @entity12 on a computer , the user needs to add a small amount of code to the operating system and this is why the technology is aimed at developers , rather than consumers			1
however , the technology can be fitted to smartphones , in place of front - facing cameras for example , so future versions may be integrated into new handsets and tablets			0
the company was set up in 2011 by @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 after they left the @entity76			0
‘ we ’ve spent a tremendous effort on making [ @entity12 ] easy to set up and fully automatic so that it works accurately and reliably in a wide range of environments , ’ explained the founders			2
the current tracker can be mounted to computer monitors and @entity47 tablets , pictured			0
the firm has also now made the technology available to @entity51 developers			1
to install @entity12 on a computer , or tablet , the user needs to add a small amount of code to the operating system ‘ we have also built the world ’s only eye - tracking solution for @entity51 that allows for a seamless integration into everyday products such as smartphones , tablets , consumer electronics and cars			1
’ @entity12 works with standard glasses , but the firm said there can be accuracy problems with bifocals and other special lenses , or glasses that have coating - including polarised glasses			2
the first batch of trackers was released last year but sold out			0
customers can now pre-order trackers from the second batch which will be shipped in @entity113 this year			0
although the @entity116 technology is aimed at developers , it can be fitted to smartphones and tablets in place of front - facing cameras for example , pictured			2
future versions may , therefore , be integrated into new handsets or other devices			0
customers can pre-order trackers for delivery in @entity113 this year			0

the @entity12 uses infrared light ( @entity131 ) to track the position of a viewer ’s eye
it then uses an advanced *algorithm* to determine their point of gaze
the technology can be calibrated to 9 , 12 or 16 points of a person ’s eye
@entity12 costs $ 99 ( £ 59 ) and currently works with pcs and surface tablets
the @entity14 firm has also released the code to @entity51 developers
