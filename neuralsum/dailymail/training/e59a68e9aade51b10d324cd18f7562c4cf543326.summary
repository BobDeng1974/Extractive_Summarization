by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 ' record $ 2.84 billion loss did n't come as a shock for a former flight attendant who worked 12 years for the company			1
once known as the high - flying luxury airline , mr @entity7 says the iconic @entity10 brand fails to meet its high standards			1
mr @entity7 , who spent his career attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class @entity3 flight attendant , told @entity1 why @entity17 is spiralling downhill and will continue to do so until the @entity10 government addresses ' the white elephant in the room '			1
' when i started , we gave our amenity packs which had ear plugs , pajamas , face mist sprays , face masks , expensive moisturisers , ' he said			0
' the economy class got a little kit too and there was even something for the children			0
' mr @entity7 , who maintains contact with his former colleagues who currently work for the airline , says passengers have to specifically ask for such services which puts them in ' an awkward position '			1
this is one of the reasons why he believes passengers are no longer getting their value for money			2
' @entity3 has taken away the little intricacies and although that may not be the stand alone reason why people do n't fly with them anymore , people are paying top dollar and they 're not satisfied , ' he said			0
@entity3 services and staff are failing to meet the expectations of passengers staff morale is at an all - time low mr @entity7 says his colleagues used to be proud of working for such a landmark @entity10 brand			1
' they would put on their uniform with pride - just as if it was like a military uniform , ' he said			0
' but now they 're embarrassed , fearful for their jobs and disheartened with the union			0
' he says there 's an overall dark element surrounding staff and it 's affecting passengers and their flight experience			0
mr @entity86 says management and the board - including @entity3 chief executive @entity89 ( pictured ) - should be held responsible @entity90 and management are terrible â€¦ and refuse to take responsibility and it all comes down to the board and management			1
mr @entity86 says both should be changed immediately with intervention from the government			0
' we need to address the white elephant in the room , ' he said			0
the government needs to intervene to help @entity3 financially and also get rid of @entity89 [ @entity3 chief executive ]			0
' he also made mention that @entity3 has ' forgotten its @entity10 identity '			2
' passengers felt like they were home flying with @entity3 - they even got little jars of @entity107 - but that feeling of comfort is n't there anymore , ' he said			2
' and that 's such a shame because @entity3 is such a beautiful iconic @entity10 brand			1
' the running down of economy class mr @entity86 says passengers in economy class are getting the short end of the stick if they fly with @entity3			2
' with the prices that they pay , the normal passengers should be getting the same respect as business class and quite frankly they 're not , ' he said			0
' me as a consumer - i would n't pay top dollar when you 're treated just the same , if not better , on other airlines for a cheaper price			0
' @entity3 no longer has ' the whole package ' , mr @entity7 said poor service and staffing this also includes the dwindling number of cabin crew on board @entity3 flights compared to other carriers			1
' there are n't enough staff on board to tend to the passengers and this is another huge factor , ' mr @entity7 said			1
the staff are also ' disengaged ' and often miss the attention to detail			0
' we used to be an airline with 100 per cent customer satisfaction , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' let 's face it , it 's not like this anymore for both passengers and staff			0
' so where 's the airline going now ? ' on a rapid downhill slide , ' mr @entity7 told @entity1			2
