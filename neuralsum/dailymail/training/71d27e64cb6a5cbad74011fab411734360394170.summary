the idea of losing weight while you sleep may seem too good to be true for many dieters			0
but , following a ground - breaking new scientific study , it could just be possible			0
researchers have discovered that sleeping in the cold can help you shed pounds because the body 's metabolism speeds up to keep you warm			0
experts think sleeping in cooler rooms or under thinner blankets could lead the body 's metabolism to speed up the study suggests that people who sleep naked , under a thinner duvet , or who turn down their bedroom radiator could be reaping the rewards in terms of their weight			1
experts from the @entity24 asked male volunteers to sleep in climate - controlled bedrooms during the experiment , to see how their temperature affected their weight			1
the research subjects were given identical meals to ensure they all took in the same amount of calories over the four - month period when the study took place			2
they were also given the same sheets and night - clothes to make sure that did not affect the experiment			0
the men then spent different months sleeping at different temperatures ; one month at @entity43 , two months at @entity44 and one at @entity46			1
scientists noticed that , during the week that the men slept at the lowest temperature , their bodies changed to enable them to lose weight			2
a study in which men slept at different climates found their bodies changed according to the temperatures experts say the amount of ' brown fat ' , which produces heat by burning calories , doubled during the weeks at the cold temperatures , effectively speeding up the men 's metabolisms			1
when the men slept at the higher temperatures for a month , the effect went into reverse			0
@entity68 , a professor at @entity69 , told the @entity70 : ' these were all healthy young men to start with , but just by sleeping in a colder room , they gained metabolic advantages that could , over time , lessen their risk for diabetes and other metabolic problems			1
' @entity78 fat , which produces 300 times more heat than any organ in the body and so burns off calories very quickly , is plentiful in babies but levels drop to almost zero as people become adults .			0

researchers asked men to sleep in controlled temperatures for study
men spent one month at @entity43 , two months at @entity44 and one month at @entity46
study found their metabolism sped up for the month when room was coolest
experts think levels of ' brown fat ' increase in colder bodies , burning calories
scientists say the study could be used to help those at risk of diabetes
