by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity4 is to blame for the growing popularity of @entity6 , @entity3 cabinet minister @entity2 has claimed			1
the @entity7 said the former @entity3 prime minister was ' such a phenomenal leader ' that today 's leaders are just ' shades of monotone '			1
he said @entity13 's party were just ' a mirror image ' the the main political parties - and should not be treated as radical outsiders			1
@entity13 has benefited from today 's politicians all having to accept @entity19 's legacy , claims @entity2 mr @entity2 ' comments are likely to cause anger in @entity22 over the suggestion that mr @entity24 does not have the pulling power of the @entity19			1
the communities secretary was asked in an interview with @entity28 about the rise of @entity6			1
he said : ' in many ways it 's mrs @entity4 's fault			0
she was such a phenomenal leader			1
she affected not just the @entity3 but the @entity32 and the @entity33			0
she brought the middle ground to the right			1
' what 's the difference between what @entity38 was trying to do and the difference between @entity41 and @entity38 ? it becomes shades of monotone			1
he added that the way to tackle @entity6 was to ' connect with the man on the street '			1
mr @entity2 said : ' it 's always tempting for a political party to say " well , if we just do this , if we just have this policy , if we just make this pledge , it will shoot their fox "			0
no. ' you 've got to see these things in context			0
i do n't doubt the next election is really a choice between ' do you want to see @entity24 or @entity64 through the door of @entity22 '			2
' i think people will make that decision , but it is n't enough for us to do that			2
the reason why @entity6 has done well is something that we need to understand about the way we connect			1
' mr @entity2 added : ' they 're kind of a mirror image of us			0
i do n't believe that @entity6 is different from any other political party			1
' it will have some very nice people within it ; it will have some less nice people within it			0
i 've always been of the view that there is n't a silver bullet about @entity6			1
' it 's not about @entity87 and it 's not about immigration			0
it 's about the political system			0
and it 's a @entity95			0
' the only way you can beat @entity6 is be good councillors , be good mps , connect with the population , the man on the street , talk to folks and do all of the types of things you would do if you were fighting a @entity108			2
' thatcherite cabinet minister @entity2 said mrs @entity4 had been so ' phenomenal ' that other leaders paled in comparison but he suggested the party 's rise could actually benefit the @entity113			2
he said : ' i saw something on the doorstep this year which i had n't seen before			2
i 'm talking about @entity118			0
' it was , i think , in @entity120 , in a sort of housing estate , a very traditional @entity32 voter , and they said they were going to vote @entity3 for the first time to keep @entity6 out			2
' that 's very unusual			0
in all the years of fighting @entity128 and the protest vote , i 've never come across somebody who wanted to actually stop the protest vote			0
' i thought that was really interesting			0
i have n't entirely got my mind round it but i think it offers us some possibilities .			2

communities secretary said she was so ' phenomenal ' others ca n't compare
she ' brought middle ground to right ' leaving it all ' shades of monotone ' now
@entity6 leader @entity13 has *exploited* the *muddle* to win support
