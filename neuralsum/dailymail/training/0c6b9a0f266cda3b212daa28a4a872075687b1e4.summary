blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to @entity3 is set for the final countdown as @entity5 moved the huge @entity7 rocket that will launch it into space onto the famous @entity11 launch pad			1
it will blast the experimental capsule in orbit - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by @entity5 's even bigger space launch system			1
' we 've been working toward this launch for months , and we 're in the final stretch , ' said @entity20 director @entity20			0
during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity31 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity33 off the @entity35 coast			0
during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			0
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity51 flights			1
the capsule will re-enter @entity31 's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph , generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity56 , before splashing down in the @entity33			0
the @entity7 rocket , built by @entity23 , made its move on tuesday night to nearby @entity25 at @entity11			1
the rocket 's three @entity58 were tested , processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to @entity51 's service module			1
it then was raised wednesday from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration			0
' @entity51 is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into space is on the launch pad			1
' we 're 64 days away from taking the next step in deep space exploration			0
' @entity51 was moved sunday out of the @entity72 at @entity5 's @entity73 in @entity74 as its launch abort system was fitted			1
this system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket			0
during the december , uncrewed flight , the jettison motor , which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency , will be tested			1
for @entity51 's dry run , the @entity89 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules , and the three systems are tested together , the @entity51 spacecraft will be considered complete			1
it then will wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-november , when the @entity7 rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft			2
meanwhile @entity51 was moved sunday out of the @entity72 at @entity5 's @entity73 in @entity74 as its launch abort system was fitted			1
the three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			0
each has an rs - 68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust			2
all totaled , the three @entity7 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust			1
the second stage of the @entity7 rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			2
it uses one @entity123 engine , also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust			2
the three primary core elements of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) @entity7 rocket have now been put together , forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send @entity51 far from @entity31 to allow @entity5 to evaluate the spacecraft 's performance in space			1
the three @entity133 were attached in @entity23 's @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , at @entity11 in @entity74			0
the @entity135 building is located at @entity25 where the mission will lift off			0
the first booster was attached to the center rocket in june with the second one was attached in early august			0
' the day - to - day processing is performed by @entity23 , ' said @entity142 of @entity5 's @entity143 of the @entity144 ( @entity144 )			2
' @entity5 's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up			2
' @entity142 explained that during major testing experts from @entity5 's @entity144 monitor the work on consoles in @entity153 at @entity11			2
@entity154 is home to the @entity73 's upgraded @entity156			0
the facility allows engineers to monitor voice , data , telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions			0
the huge @entity7 rocket w earlier this week put together for the first time at @entity11 in @entity74 ahead of a first test flight of the @entity51 capsule in december , a mission known as @entity169 - 1			1
@entity5 's @entity74 spaceport is also where @entity51 was built and is being processed			1
the @entity7 rocket stages were assembled at the @entity23 plant in @entity173 , @entity174 , about 20 miles west of @entity175			2
after completion , the rocket components were shipped down the @entity178 and @entity179 , a canal , to the @entity180			0
from there they traveled to @entity11 , arriving on may 6			0
the elements of the rocket 's first stage were then transported to the @entity135 for preflight processing			0
' after the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing , the struts were attached , connecting the booster stages with the center core , ' @entity142 said			0
for @entity51 's dry run , the @entity89 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
a @entity7 rocket will do the heavy lifting			2
it will eventually be launced by @entity5 's new @entity205 ' megarocket '			2
for its first flight test , @entity205 will be configured for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity51 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit			1
in its most powerful configuration , @entity205 will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , which will enable missions even farther into our solar system , including such destinations as an asteroid and @entity3			0
when asked by a reporter , @entity20 said he wishes @entity51 's flight pace was quicker			1
' but it is what it is , ' he said			0
' given the budget that we have , i think we 've got the best program that you could imagine			0
' @entity51 has its roots in the @entity230 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity31 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity236 project .			1

three @entity7 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust
@entity51 capsule will *undergo* first test flight in december
comes as @entity5 *bosses* *reveal* *private* contracts for shuttle replacement so they can concentrate on the project
