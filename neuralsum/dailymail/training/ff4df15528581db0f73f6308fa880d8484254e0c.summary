@entity0 suffered a major setback in his pledge to balance the books today - after official figures showed borrowing had gone up over the past year			1
borrowing spiked by £ 3.7billion – or 6.1 per cent – in the 12 months to october compared to the year before			1
it means mr @entity0 is well off the government ’s target to cut the deficit by 12 per cent this year			2
@entity11 's mounting debt pile has now hit £ 1.5 trillion - up £ 150 billion in just a year			1
october 's data showed receipts from income tax and capital gains tax up 1.5 per cent on the same month last year			1
these are 0.4 per cent lower on the year - to - date , despite economic growth running at around 3 per cent and a surge in employment			2
the poor performance is blamed on the proportion of new jobs which are low - paid or part - time , meaning a lot of the new wages generated do not meet the £ 10,000 threshold for paying income tax			0
central government current spending grew by £ 1.1 billion partly due to a £ 500 million increase in benefit spending which the @entity38 said was a result of increases in the state pension			0
the @entity11 's underlying debt was £ 1.449 trillion , a fall on the month before but higher when compared to the £ 1.352 trillion in october last year			1
it now represents 79.5 per cent of gross domestic product , down from september 's 79.9 per cent but ahead of 77.7 per cent a year before			1
@entity46 's shadow chancellor @entity45 has criticised the government 's record cutting the deficit the overall scale of public sector debt was revised downwards as a result of @entity53 being reclassified as a private sector body after the government 's share in it was reduced to 25 per cent			2
net debt including the public sector banks had been £ 2.285 trillion in september or 125.8 per cent of gdp but this september figure has now been revised down by £ 522 billion to £ 1.763 trillion or 97 per cent of gdp			1
for october it fell slightly again to £ 1.761 trillion or 96.6 per cent			1
@entity62 mp , @entity46 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , responding to today ’s public sector finance figures , said : ‘ these figures are yet another damaging setback for @entity0			0
‘ borrowing so far this year is now £ 3.7 billion higher than the same period last year			1
@entity0 ’s promise to balance the books by next year lies in tatters			0
as the @entity72 has said , stagnating wages and too many people in low - paid jobs are leading to more borrowing			0
‘ @entity46 will balance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next @entity76 , but we will do so in a fairer way			0
‘ our economic plan will reverse the £ 3 billion tax cut for the top one £ of earners and stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest pensioners			2
we will raise child benefit by just one £ for two years and cut ministers ’ pay by five			0
' and our plan will deliver a recovery for the many not just a few , with the rising living standards and more good jobs we need to get the deficit down			0
’ but a @entity38 spokesman said : ‘ while today 's public finance figures show borrowing is down this month compared to last year , the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances			2
‘ at the same time , we have to recognise that the @entity11 is not immune to the problems being experienced in @entity100 and other parts of the world economy			0
that 's why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient @entity11 economy			0
