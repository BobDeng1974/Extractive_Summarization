over half of men ( 53 per cent ) admit to frequently preening and using beauty products to improve their appearance , according to @entity112			0
this is a dramatic shift away from traditional male behaviours in the ascendant when the term ‘ metrosexual ’ was coined almost 20 years ago			0
the @entity118 factor : @entity119 , @entity120 finalist and celebrity @entity121 winner , famously spends a lot of time on his looks beautification methods used run the gamut , with one in seven men ( 15 per cent ) plucking or waxing unruly eyebrows , seven per cent wearing concealer to cover up a spot and one in 20 ( five per cent ) using fake tan			0

@entity154 cricketer @entity153 's flawless skin and bright , white teeth are enough to make any girl or guy jealous some men are attempting to improve their image out of regard for their partner ( almost one in 10 ) , or because of pressure from other male friends to look good ( 12 per cent )			2

body image expert and campaigner @entity209 said , ' i 've noticed that there 's been a major attitude shift in men under the age of 25 and there 's more pressure on men now to " take care of themselves "			2
' i think it 's great that men now have the freedom to experiment with how they look , but we have to learn from what 's historically happened to women – with beauty and grooming can come a lot of insecurity , if it 's not presented and handled in the right way			2
' men need to resist the pressure to conform to an identical look			0
