a university professor has decided to live inside a dumpster for an entire year in a radical experiment to see if people would be happier living a simpler lifestyle			1
after formulating and finalising his plans for the undertaking last year , professor @entity5 has now been housed in the 36 - square - foot container for more than seven months			1
he may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer			2
the heat hit @entity30 in the summer and reaches -5c in the winter			0
having now built temperature controls , though , he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project			0
however , managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue			2
he said : ' we hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing , energy sustainability , science education , and higher quality of life			2
' ultimately , the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing			0
' this is an outlier experiment			0
the students and university , thought they thought the experiment a bit odd , have warmed to the idea , even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to			0
' professor @entity5 ( left ) holds a phd in @entity59 , while pictured right is the storage space below the dumpster which contains his belongings mr @entity5 's bed and living space inside the dumpster			1
