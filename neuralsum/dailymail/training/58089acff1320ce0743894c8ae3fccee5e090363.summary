@entity12 ruled friday that @entity5 ' 2004 voter - approved amendment to the state constitution violates the rights of gay couples , clearing the way for the first same - sex marriage in a traditional southern state			1
he did n't put his ruling on hold as some judges in other states have done			0
that caused confusion among the state 's 75 county clerks , said @entity80 executive director @entity79			0
he said @entity12 should have issued a stay , just to avoid saturday 's scramble			2
' the court did n't give us any time to get the kinks worked out , ' @entity79 said			0
attorney general @entity87 said he would appeal the ruling and asked it be suspended during that process			0

' @entity108 did a tremendous disservice to the people of @entity5 by leaving this in limbo			0
' @entity5 ' amendment was passed in 2004 with the overwhelming support of @entity5 voters			2
@entity12 's ruling also overturned a 1997 state law banning gay marriage			1
' the exclusion of a minority for no rational reason is a dangerous precedent , ' he wrote			0
the @entity124 @entity123 last year ruled that a law forbidding the federal government from recognizing same - sex marriages was unconstitutional			2

@entity5 ' ruling came a week after @entity87 became the first statewide elected official to announce he personally supports gay marriage rights			1
but he said he would continue to defend the constitutional ban in court			0
@entity165 , @entity87 's spokesman , said friday the attorney general sought the stay because ' we know that questions about validity of certain actions will arise absent a stay '			0
gay marriage is legal in @entity174 , @entity175 and the @entity176			2
though technically considered southern states by the @entity179 , they were not part of the old @entity181 , like @entity5 .			0
