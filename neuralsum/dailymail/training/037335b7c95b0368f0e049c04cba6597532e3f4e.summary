roadside bombs were set off , leading to a gun battle that left 52 prisoners and eight soldiers dead , the officials said , adding that another eight soldiers and seven prisoners were wounded			1
it was not immediately clear if the prisoners were killed by soldiers or militants , or if the @entity35 group , who have seized large areas of land in @entity34 's north west , was involved			1
so far , no one has claimed responsibility for the bus attack , which left the vehicle as a burned - out shell on the side of the road			1
the motive for today 's killings is not immediately clear			2
much of @entity34 's recent bloodshed is linked to sectarian divisions that have deepened since @entity74 militants seized large swathes of northern @entity34 last month and declared an @entity77 empire			0
sunni militants have been carrying out attacks around the southern edge of @entity4			1
in response @entity82 militias have been abducting @entity74 they suspect of militancy in rural districts of @entity4 , with many later turning up dead			1
