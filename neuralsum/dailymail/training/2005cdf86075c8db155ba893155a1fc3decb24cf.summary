no one paid much attention to the centenary of this titanic struggle			2
given that in 1915 all the main parties were preoccupied with the @entity6 , it was an understandable oversight			2
one century further on , and we have no excuse this time			1
so why is our educational establishment not merely playing down the 200th anniversary of the @entity11 , but ignoring it altogether ? you do not have to be an old soldier or a historian to regard 1815 as one of history ’s almighty milestones			1
the removal of @entity19 from the stage helped to redraw the map of @entity22 and , indeed , the world			1
whether you regard that as a good thing , a mixed result or a downright abomination , it still accounts for the fact that , to this day , most of the world speaks @entity45			1
but this was also , emphatically , a multi-national victory ; @entity32 troops were actually outnumbered by their @entity50 and @entity51 allies , so much so that @entity53 lord @entity52 has called @entity11 ‘ the first @entity55 operation ’			1
an eminent consortium of academics and military experts are now putting together an impressive series of anniversary projects for next year			1
and this is certainly not some triumphalist dig at the @entity63			0
rather , it is all about teaching future generations to understand the importance of a battle which , as a turning point , was as fundamental as the defeat of @entity70			0
and the response of our educational establishment ? sorry , but we ’re too busy			1
history enthusiasts gathered in in @entity75 , just south of @entity76 , in 2005 to reenact the famous battle on its 190th anniversary june 18 next year will see @entity79 packed to the rafters			1
it has been booked by @entity82 , the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary			1
the great and good will be invited , of course , but so , too , will more than a thousand members of the public , particularly children from any town or village that can unearth a @entity11 connection			1
for the main point of the charity is to engage schools all over @entity32 – and @entity93			2
‘ we really want to get schools everywhere , particularly state schools , learning about this historical watershed , ’ says a spokesman for the charity			2
while @entity82 boasts some illustrious backers , not to mention the current @entity101 and his family , it has a dedicated educational arm			2
a committee of experienced teachers from across the academic spectrum have drawn up a full range of educational tools and resources			2
and very impressive it is , too			0
some 200 historical items connected to the battle – from swords to medical kits – will be distributed among schools for study and discussion			2
special packs for every age range have been designed and will be freely available to any teacher			0
june 18 next year will see @entity79 packed to the rafters			1
it has been booked by @entity82 , the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary as the charity prepares to put all this on a dedicated website , created with support from the @entity128 , the organisers are understandably keen to ensure that schools across the country know about all this freely available material			1
hence their astonishment after writing to the @entity133 to seek a meeting with the @entity135 , @entity136 , or one of her officials to discuss it all			1
@entity139 came a short letter saying that mrs @entity141 and her staff had ‘ no room in the diary ’			0
when i call her department , a spokesman refers all questions to the @entity149 , through which @entity11 200 received the lottery support for its website			1
so there we have it			0
a great big – and free – educational opportunity is served up on a plate and the commissars in charge of education will not even discuss it			1
next year ’s restaging of @entity11 on the actual battlefield is set to feature more than 6,000 re-enactors no doubt if this was about , say , global warming or transgender issues , officials would be falling over themselves to offer advice and outreach programmes			1
but a landmark in @entity32 history ? straight in the bin faster than you can say ‘ @entity174 ’			0
i just wonder whether mrs @entity141 ever knew about the charity ’s request in the first place			0
the @entity82 organisers are clearly disappointed			0
‘ i just hope we can find other ways of ensuring that history teachers know what is available , ’ says its chairman , @entity182 sir @entity180			0
among some historians , there is disbelief			0
speaking from @entity191 , having just received the @entity192 from @entity63 ’s @entity193 for his new biography of the ex-emperor , the historian @entity190 is dumbfounded			0
‘ this is a magnificent opportunity to educate young people about one of the most important episodes in our history , and yet our educators are not being told about it ? ’ he asks			0
@entity136 and her staff had ‘ no room in the diary ’ for a meeting with @entity11 200 , the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary @entity11 certainly has some heavyweight backers in the @entity212 , not least the chancellor			1
last year , @entity214 , a keen student of military history , announced that the @entity216 would provide £ 1million toward the renovation of the farm at @entity219 – a central feature of the entire battle			2
the @entity11 200 organisers are not asking for major funding or even a state occasion			1
they are doing it themselves			0
all they want is a little help			0
this official response surely goes deeper			0
is it not typical of the same pusillanimous mindset that led to the bicentenary commemorations of the @entity234 being rewritten to avoid offending the @entity63 ? famously , @entity32 ’s grand re-enactment of the battle in 2005 did not involve @entity32 or @entity63 forces , but a ‘ blue ’ fleet and a ‘ red ’ fleet			0
there are already reports that next year ’s restaging of @entity11 on the actual battlefield , with more than 6,000 re-enactors , will involve a @entity63 ‘ win ’ on one day and an allied victory the next			1
not exactly , says organiser , @entity246			0
‘ one day will focus on the @entity63 cavalry and one day will focus on the allied infantry , ’ he explains			2
‘ and a lot of it will be about life among the bivouacs and so on			0
’ in other words , there will be no great winners or losers – although the @entity51 are said to be very excited about it			0
at long last , they can look forward to a major @entity22 military anniversary where they are cast as the good guys .			2

june 18 next year will be the 200th anniversary of the @entity11
@entity265 removed @entity19 from stage and helped *reshape* the world
but educational establishment *unwilling* to focus on the date in schools
and education *secretary* @entity136 could *n't* spare time to hear initiative
