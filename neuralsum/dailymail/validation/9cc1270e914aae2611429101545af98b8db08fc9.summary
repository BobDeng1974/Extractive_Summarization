they were winning the old @entity8 title that year , ending an eight - year spell outside the top flight , one of the rare periods in their history when they have played below the elite			2
in the 110 seasons they have played league football since promotion from the @entity20 to the @entity8 of the @entity21 in 1893 , they have finished , on average , eighth			0
that means they have the highest average finish , all - time , of any club			0

those were their inaugural season , plus 1895 - 96 , then 1904 - 05 , then the eight - year spell between 1954 and 1962			0

@entity30 have been in the top division non-stop since 1919 - 20 but had 13 seasons in the second tier at times before that			2
although famously a top - four team since @entity95 arrived in 1996 - 97 , they have finished outside the top 10 as recently as 1994 - 95 ( when 12th ) and were distinctly mediocre and finishing well down the pecking order in the mid- 1970s			0
