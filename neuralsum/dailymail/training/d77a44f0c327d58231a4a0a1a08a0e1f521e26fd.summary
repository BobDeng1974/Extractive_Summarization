viva forever ! the musical set to open at the @entity2 on december 11 it 's been four years since they reunited for their @entity6 tour			1
and following months of speculation whether or not they would join forces again , all five members of the @entity6 got together in @entity10 today to announce details of a @entity13 musical based on their songs			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 went back to where it all began - the @entity22 in @entity10 , where they filmed their @entity25 video in 1996			2
the musical , entitled @entity29 ! , will tell the story of ' a beautiful , talented girl and her best friends who get swept up in the obsession of today 's tv celebrity culture '			1
the musical ' charts her journey into the world of overnight fame and its impact on her relationships with her mother and the friends she thought she 'd have forever '			1
@entity15 , arguably the most successful financially since leaving the group , flew in specially from @entity52			2
write caption here not a tracksuit or platform trainer in sight : the five - piece are fortunately a lot more sophisticated these days will you see the @entity6 musical ? will you see the @entity6 musical ? now share your opinion looking more military than ' @entity15 ' , the mother - of - four , 38 , wore a black dress and peep - toe knee - high boots			1
however , while her former bandmates had wide smiles , @entity15 kept her usual stony - faced demeanour			2
@entity18 , 37 , who looked far from ' scary ' in a grey shift dress and spiked christian louboutin heels , had flown in from her new home in @entity75 via @entity52			2
@entity19 , 39 , and @entity16 , 36 , were going for girlie looks in short dress and killer heels , with the @entity79 appearing to be wearing the same @entity81 strappy sandals worn by the @entity82 recently , albeit in gold instead of silver			2
back to where it all began : the group famously filmed the video for their debut single wannabe at the same hotel in 1996 on a budget : the @entity6 in their @entity25 video when the hotel was out of use in 1996 @entity17 , 38 , appeared to have left her @entity17 persona firmly in the past with a floaty white @entity98 maxi dress , which has also been worn by @entity99 and @entity100			1
the five women had joined forces to announce details of @entity29 , a musical based on their songs and written by comedienne @entity106 and producer by @entity108 , the theatrical impresario behind the success of @entity110 ! speaking at the press conference , @entity108 hailed the group : ' i loved what the @entity6 did for women 's confidence			1
there 's something very empowering about them			2
' @entity106 , who cameoed in their film @entity119 , said : ' the second i knew this project was up for grabs i rang my agent and said i had to be involved			0
' all that hard work is going to pay off : producer @entity108 and scriptwriter @entity106 well heeled : the girl group team up with @entity106 and @entity108 for a group photo @entity29 ! is the latest ' jukebox musical ' to hit the @entity13 - that use original songs as a basis for an original storyline			1
while @entity110 ! ( @entity135 ) , @entity136 ( @entity137 ) and we will rock you ( @entity140 ) , have been a huge success , other musicals such as @entity133 ( @entity134 ) have not been as popular			0
in the run - up to today 's announcement , all five @entity6 have been hinting on their respective @entity145 pages			0
fighting for attention : the press conference saw the five bandmembers jostling to speak very serious : @entity15 looked miserable in comparison to smiling @entity16 and @entity19 on saturday , @entity15 hinted : ' @entity151 event next week , what should i wear ? ? ' excited to be travelling to @entity10 tomorrow ! ! ! packing ! ! ! ! ' @entity18 wrote this morning : ' whoop whoop where my spice biatches at ! ! ! lovin all spice fans always ! ' @entity18 's time to speak : @entity18 takes charge of the conference @entity159 has been good to them : @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity18 all look gorgeous in their demure ensembles over the past few years , @entity18 has often hinted of a possible reunion for the girl group , but it is yet to come to fruition			0
however , @entity15 was said to be against the idea because she is focused on her career as a fashion designer			0
in march , @entity17 dismissed speculation they would reunite for the @entity172 : ' not true			0
it was an honour to be asked ( for the @entity174 ) , but not everyone is comfortable about doing it so we have to respect each other ’s feelings about that			0
' chatterbox : @entity18 distracted the group as they pose up a storm providing all the laughs : @entity16 , @entity19 and @entity17 were all seen laughing as @entity18 appeared to tell a joke which @entity15 did n't seem quite understand write caption here while not directly addressing the @entity6 reunion speculation , @entity186 said this year : ' i was never going to be the best singer and it was n’t my passion			1
' the group 's reunion today comes four years after their sell - out @entity6 world tour , which ended prematurely after they cancelled the gigs in @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
during their four years in the charts , they enjoyed nine no.1 singles and two no.1 albums in the @entity205 , including one no.1 single and album in the @entity208 the musical is due to open at the @entity2 in @entity10 's @entity13 on december 11			1
