by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the fixtures for the 2014 - 15 @entity4 season have been released and there are a number of key clashes which could decided the destination of the title			1
here @entity10 previews 10 of the big ones which will have fans the length of the country glued to their tv sets when the action gets underway in august			0
champions again ! @entity20 captain @entity19 lifts the @entity4 trophy in may @entity20 v @entity22 ( saturday , august 23 ) the top two of 2013 - 14 do not have to wait long to square up this time around			1
the champions , who dropped just five points at home last season , came from behind to win this duel on @entity30 , with @entity22 gaining revenge with a 3 - 2 success at @entity33 later in the season			2
time for one better ? @entity35 and his @entity22 side travel to @entity20 early in the season @entity40 v @entity38 ( saturday , september 27 ) the @entity41 did the double over their biggest rivals last season , with a pair of 1 - 0 victories			1
the teams were separated by 10 points at the end of the campaign , so the first derby match could be key in the race for a top four placing - with new @entity38 boss @entity52 getting his first taste of a north @entity55 derby			0
keenly contested : the north @entity55 derby between @entity40 and @entity38 is one of the better games @entity60 v @entity59 ( saturday , october 25 ) the early season fixtures appear kind to new @entity60 boss @entity62 , with the visit of @entity59 looking the most testing of the first quarter of the campaign			1
the outcome of a game against @entity70 ’s men could be an indication as to how the @entity73 ’s rebuilding job is progressing - particularly with a derby against @entity20 next on the agenda			2
bang ! @entity76 fires beyond @entity60 goalkeeper @entity77 at @entity78 last year @entity22 v @entity59 ( saturday , november 8 ) @entity35 ’s slip in this match last season was a defining moment in @entity22 ’s unsuccessful title bid			1
it enabled @entity59 to complete the double over the @entity86 , whose manager @entity87 will know there can be no room for errors this time around			2
@entity60 v @entity22 ( saturday , december 13 ) the @entity92 tore @entity60 apart in this one in 2013 - 14 , loosening @entity94 ’s grip on the manager ’s job a little more			2
@entity60 , low on confidence , had no answer to the @entity86 ’ attacking verve , succumbing to a sixth home defeat of the campaign			0
if @entity103 makes a positive impact at @entity105 , it is unlikely to be as easy for the visitors next season			0
did a job on them : @entity59 had no problem disposing of @entity22 at @entity33 back in april all smiles : @entity112 and @entity113 shake hands ahead of a clash at @entity105 last season @entity20 v @entity40 ( saturday , january 17 ) @entity40 had no answer to @entity20 ’s free - flowing football at the @entity119 in december , losing 6 - 3			1
@entity121 ’s men led the table despite this defeat - but finished fourth			0
they also suffered heavy defeats at @entity22 and @entity59 , so this game could provide an indication as to whether they have made significant progress in their bid to be serious title contenders			1
nipped in : @entity132 scores for @entity20 as they beat @entity40 at the @entity119 @entity133 v @entity22 ( saturday , february 7 ) @entity134 , who last week signed a new long - term deal , is the latest @entity133 manager seeking to close the gap between the @entity138 rivals			1
however , recent form suggests it will take time - @entity133 last beat @entity22 three and a half years ago and despite an impressive campaign , still finished 12 points adrift of them in 2013 - 14			2
tucked home : @entity143 slots beyond @entity144 as @entity22 hammered @entity133 at @entity33 @entity145 v @entity20 ( saturday , march 14 ) home form is likely to be key if the @entity145 are to retain their @entity4 status			1
the last time they were in the top flight , 2010 - 11 , they were unable to manage the feat - but they bloodied a few noses at @entity154 along the way			0
@entity60 and @entity133 were beaten and @entity40 could only escape with a point - however , @entity20 won 6 - 1 there			2
grinning : @entity158 , then at @entity20 , celebrates scoring against @entity145 in the 2009/10 season @entity40 v @entity59 ( saturday , april 25 ) the @entity161 have had the upper hand in against their @entity55 rivals recently , with the 6 - 0 drubbing at @entity78 last time out highlighting this			1
if both are in the running for the title when this game takes place - four weeks before the end of the season - it could be a classic			0
controversy : @entity173 wrongly sent off @entity174 for an alleged handball away at @entity59 @entity133 v @entity38 ( sunday , may 24 ) the most appealing of the final day ’s fixtures			0
these teams threatened to claim a @entity179 place last season , before having to settle for the alternative of the @entity182			0
if a top - four place is available to either at @entity185 , it will ratchet up the tension			0
battle : @entity189 and @entity190 tussle for possession as @entity133 travelled to @entity38			0

@entity20 *hoping* to retain @entity4 title
@entity22 finished second last season with @entity59 third
first @entity198 derby is at the @entity119 on november 1
