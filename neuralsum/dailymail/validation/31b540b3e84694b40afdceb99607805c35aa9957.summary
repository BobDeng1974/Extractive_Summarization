' @entity2 , who is homeless , is a @entity17 citizen who was born in @entity20			1
he grew up using @entity32			0
he has learned @entity33 , but he has never learned more than rudimentary written @entity34			0
maj. @entity35 , a spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office , which runs the jail , declined to comment on the specific allegations			2
she generally defended the jail 's ability to handle deaf inmates and others with disabilities , and said several deputies in the jail are proficient in sign language			2
but she also acknowledged that communication with a deaf inmate is more problematic in cases where the inmate ca n't communicate in written @entity34			0
in court papers filed monday , lawyers for the sheriff ask a judge to dismiss the case , arguing that even if @entity2 's allegations are true , they fail to show intentional discrimination because they attempted various different ways to communicate with him , including handwritten notes			1
and even if the discrimination were intentional , the lawyers write that it would not violate federal law because there is a rational basis for the discrimination : ' it takes extra resources and creates additional security considerations to bring in an @entity33 interpreter , ' they write			2

it was not until he was arraigned feb. 4 , and a court interpreter was present , that he understood the charge against him			2
when he was offered an opportunity to communicate , he said the jail provided a @entity106 device			0
@entity2 said the machine was useless — it types out @entity34 text he does n't understand , and as a practical matter , he said , no one in the deaf community still uses a @entity106 device			1
he needed instead access to a videophone or video relay service that is more commonly used , he said			0
maj. @entity117 , director of the jail for the sheriff , also declined to comment specifically on @entity2 's care , but generally defended the use of a @entity106 machine			1

@entity158 , an attorney with the @entity159 , who is helping on @entity2 's case , said cases like his are ' distressingly common			1
there 's an assumption that persons behind bars have no rights			2
' the @entity156 itself does not spell out exactly what kind of accommodations a jail must make for deaf inmates			0
but since the law was passed , several lawsuits have addressed similar issues			0
in 2010 , the @entity176 reached a settlement requiring it to provide qualified interpreters during the booking process and when providing medical care , among other things			2
