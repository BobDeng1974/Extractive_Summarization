by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 18 november 2013 charge : a think - tank suggests the @entity2 could use money earned from gp visits towards opening hours patients should be charged £ 10 a night to stay in hospital and £ 10 every time they see their gp , according to a think - tank			1
it also wants to raise prescription fees , make dying patients pay for end - of - life care and impose £ 10 fines for every missed appointment			1
reform , an independent think - tank , says the charges could be used to improve certain @entity2 services such as funding surgeries to open at weekends			1
it also claims the fees are ‘ unavoidable ’ as the @entity2 is incurring billions of debts footing the bill for the care of the aging population			0
but campaigners fear such charges will unfairly penalise the elderly and those with long - term conditions and may deter them from seeking help			0
estimates show the health service will have annual debts of £ 30billion by 2020 and there are growing concerns that standards are far worse compared to other countries in @entity40			2
around two - thirds of @entity43 countries charge patients to see their gp ranging from 80p in @entity45 to £ 18 in @entity46 , with an extra £ 5 for a home visit			1
and half make patients pay for hospitals visits or stays including @entity46 where they are £ 7.50 per night and @entity51 which makes them pay £ 8 every time they go to @entity55			2
@entity56 , research director at the think - tank said : ‘ the government must find a way of generating more money for the @entity2			1
‘ we currently have a system which is very generous			0
‘ a lot of people who are reasonably well off would n’t mind paying £ 10 for a @entity8 appointment on a saturday morning , for example			0
’ ‘ few will want to debate higher @entity2 charges but the funding outlook for the service makes it unavoidable			0
prescription charges are the easiest route to new revenue , with exemptions for people on low incomes built in			0
’ the think - tank also recommends charging patients £ 10 for every night they spend in hospital and would consider making them pay for unnecessary @entity55 visits			1
poll : more than half of gps are in favour of the change , with some suggesting charges of up to £ 25 it would also raise prescription costs from £ 7.85 to £ 10 and make the elderly and pregnant women pay - currently they are exempt from charges			1
controversially , it wants to impose a means - tested system for end of life care meaning the majority of dying patients would pay for pain relief and extra nursing			2
this summer a poll found that half of @entity84 are in favour of charging patients for appointments - with some wanting to impose fees of between £ 5 and £ 25 a time			1
a poll of 440 gps by @entity108 magazine found that 51 per cent were in favour of making patients pay to deter them for turning up unnecessarily			2
one , dr @entity111 , a gp in @entity112 in @entity113 , said : ‘ i work in a walk - in centre			0
‘ the amount of people who come through the door for practically no reason at all and say “ i was out and saw this sign for a walk - in centre where one can see a doctor , so i came in			0
” ‘ people do n’t value the things if they get it cheap , worse still if they get it for nothing			0
