a former @entity1 intelligence officer has claimed in a new book that members of the @entity5 police force tipped - off senior republicans about a plan to arrest the entire organisation 's leadership in 1974			1
@entity10 , who is now a barrister in the @entity11 joined the @entity1 in the last 1960s and claims that senior @entity5 police officers colluded with the @entity1			1
mr @entity10 's book alleges that as well as members of the @entity5 police force , an @entity15 , the provisional @entity1 were also assisted by a top banker , a stock broker , a journalist as well as several mainstream politicians			1
@entity10 , pictured , claims the @entity1 received tip - offs from the @entity5 police force in advance of arrests mr @entity10 , who is now a barrister in @entity23 , joined the @entity1 in the late 1960s served as an intelligence officer mr @entity10 told @entity25 : ' i think that the army council had particular contacts with those in the security area which were n't even shared with me			1
we had contacts in the law offices of the states and contacts in the upper echelons of the guards			0
' mr @entity10 said much of the republican leadership was in talks with members of the @entity42 clergy in @entity43 , @entity44			1
he said : ' take something like @entity43 , the place was raided and they ( the leadership ) got away			0
because a tip - off was received that the special branch were on their way to @entity43 and that tip - off came from within the @entity15			0
' it was n't just in 1974 and it was n't just concentrated in border areas like @entity55 , it was some individuals but it was more widespread			0
' mr @entity10 's allegations come as the @entity59 in @entity60 reported that there was no evidence to suggest that the @entity63 had colluded with the @entity1 in the murder of @entity65 in 1974 in @entity66			1
the @entity59 said that while there had been failures in the police investigation , there was no evidence to suggest any form of cover - up			1
a review by the @entity59 of @entity60 found no evidence of collusion between the @entity1 , pictured , and the @entity63 over the murder of @entity65 who was shot in @entity66 on august 15 , 1975 dr @entity79 of the @entity59 's office said : ' we have looked in great detail at all the available information and intelligence , both about the murder itself and about the various people family members thought were linked to it			1
' we found no evidence that would indicate police knew about the planned attack beforehand and could have done something about it , or that anyone was protected from arrest or prosecution because they were a police informant			2
' @entity65 was shot at @entity100 close to its junction with the @entity102 in north @entity66 on august 15 1974 and died in hospital several weeks later			2
the @entity1 claimed responsibility for the fatal attack			2
in a complaint to the @entity59 's office , a member of the @entity65 family alleged that police colluded with the killers by failing to investigate the murder properly in order to protect police informants within the @entity1			1
they also claimed police had destroyed the murder weapon , lost significant exhibits and failed to pursue the names of five suspects which had been supplied to them			0
dr @entity79 said : ' investigative failures are not in themselves automatic evidence of collusion			0
' we did not find any evidence that police chose not to pursue relevant lines of inquiry or that information was withheld from the detectives investigating the murder			0
' the ombudsman 's investigation found that 12 spent cartridges and a bullet head were recovered from the scene by the @entity63 and military personnel , as was a piece of card with writing on it which was attached to a coat hanger which was also found			2
the report said although detectives were able to speak with mr @entity65 in hospital several times and to his wife , the interviews did not open up any new leads			2
mr @entity65 's family claimed that @entity63 officers protected the killers because they were informants in the @entity1 days after the attack , on september 23 1974 , it was revealed police had received a report that a rifle , ammunition and clothing had been found in a flat in @entity100 and that forensics had linked the weapon to mr @entity65 's murder and two other shooting incidents			1
a man was arrested in 1974 , but the ombudsman said there were no notes available to indicate whether or not this person was interviewed			0
three years later , in 1977 , police authorised the destruction of the rifle and ammunition which had been found			0
but in 1978 , a police search of a social club in @entity66 on an unconnected matter uncovered a handwritten document which appeared to be a debrief of mr @entity65 's shooting			1
the document made reference to the involvement of three people , two of whom were subsequently arrested and interviewed			0
in 2005 , a member of mr @entity65 's family provided police with names of people they believed were involved in the murder but police later recorded that there was nothing to link them to the killing			1
in 2007 , the same family member provided the @entity196 with the names of two people believed to be involved in the attack			0
the @entity59 said records indicated that one of the suspects was in prison at the time of the murder , while the other one was in police custody			2
dr @entity79 concluded that police did not manage the crime scene properly and that critical evidence had not been preserved or examined			0
similarly , he found no meaningful investigation into how police responded to the discovery of guns , ammunition and clothing			0
the @entity59 said there was no evidence that the person who reported this material to police was ever interviewed ; no rationale why police submitted the rifle and ammunition for examination but not the clothing , and no audit trail of what happened to any of these items .			2
