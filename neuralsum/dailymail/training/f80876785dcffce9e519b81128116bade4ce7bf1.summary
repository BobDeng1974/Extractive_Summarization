by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 29 march 2013 only 6 per cent of those questioned would trust the secretary of state for education @entity2 parents are concerned about the effect the government is having on their child 's education , a poll suggests			1
around one in 12 ( 8 per cent ) parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact on the education system since it took power , while almost half ( 44 per cent ) said the impact has been negative			1
the survey of around 2,000 adults , commissioned by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , indicates that the majority would entrust their child 's education to school leaders			2
asked who , other than themselves , they trust the most to educate their son or daughter , more than half ( 59 per cent ) of those questioned said head teachers , followed by the local authority ( 16 per cent ) and school governors ( 13 per cent )			1
around 6 per cent said they would trust the secretary of state for education , a post currently held by @entity2 , and the same proportion said they would trust an academy chain			1
the poll also reveals that just 2 per cent believe politicians should be able to prescribe what teachers teach , while a third ( 35 per cent ) said teachers should be able to exercise their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils			0
the survey comes as the @entity18 meets for its annual conference in @entity45			0
@entity18 general secretary @entity46 said : ' the fact that only 8 per cent of parents think that the government has had a positive impact on the education system is very significant			1
' she added : ' it appears that it is now only the secretary of state who believes that his policies are taking education in the right direction			1
@entity2 's proposals for examination reform , the national curriculum and academies and free schools are all being questioned			2
' the poll shows that mr @entity2 ' does not have the confidence of the profession or parents ' , ms @entity46 said			1
nearly half of parents do n't trust the coalition with their child 's education ( stock image ) parents were also asked if they were in favour of the government 's plans to allow schools to decide on teachers ' pay - a key issue in the @entity18 's current dispute with the government			1
one in four ( 25 per cent ) said that every school should have to set its own pay system , while 60 % were in favour of a national pay system for all teachers			2
ms @entity46 acknowledged that the survey had not asked parents if they would back teachers if they proceeded with strike action over pay			0
the @entity18 and @entity92 teaching unions are proposing to stage a series of regional walkouts , followed by a national stoppage before @entity96 in a continuing row over pay , pensions and workload			0
she said that if they were to ask ' do you want your child 's teacher to go on strike ? ' the ' greatest likelihood ' is that they would say no. general secretary of the @entity18 @entity46 said that strike action disrupts a child 's education and should be avoided when possible ' strike action inconveniences people , ' ms @entity46 said			1
but she added that the action was not just about pay and pensions , but also workload and " the umbrella question underlying it , which is , ' is what 's being done to your children 's education the right thing ? '			0
" ms @entity46 said the @entity18 is planning a series of rallies to meet parents , governors and young people to ask , " do you think what 's going on in education is right ? "			2
a @entity132 spokesman said : ' this survey in fact demonstrates the high level of parental support for our reforms			0
' almost two - thirds of parents want heads and teachers running their schools , rather than councils - that is why we have given schools more freedom than ever before to do just that through our academies programme			0
' our new national curriculum will be significantly slimmer than the current one , and does not tell teachers how to teach its content - this poll finds that 98 per cent of parents support us in that			0
' additionally , the vast majority of our new free schools are so popular with parents that they are over-subscribed			0
' there is much to do but our package of reforms will again give all parents the confidence that their child is receiving the first - class education they deserve			2
' the @entity163 poll questioned 2,008 adults between march 12 and 18 .			0
