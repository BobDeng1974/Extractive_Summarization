by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 15:15 est , 20 march 2013 @entity1 has conceded his season has been ' not brilliant ' as @entity4 's players put on a show for their junior colleagues today			1
@entity8 's team were in lockdown today as they prepared for two crucial @entity11 qualifiers against @entity12 ( friday ) and @entity13 ( next tuesday ) , but the @entity4 under 17 squad - and @entity15 - were able to sneak in for a privileged view of their training session			1
@entity1 stopper : @entity4 goalkeeper @entity1 springs into action at @entity21 , motivated by @entity23 's return to the international fold ice - cool : @entity23 makes a save during a training session at @entity21 @entity1 , 25 , admitted his own season has ' not been brilliant ' in contrast to last year , when he won the @entity31 title with @entity32 and participated in @entity33 , as @entity23 returned to the @entity4 fold to challenge for the no 1 jersey			1
and although he welcomes the return of @entity37 ’s @entity23 after a two - year break from international football , @entity1 is determined to try and keep hold of the goalkeeping jersey			1
' @entity42 good enough to push me ? yes , but i ’ve felt that every time i ’ve come away with @entity4 , ’ said @entity1			1
' my job when i was first involved was to really push hard			1
we all train like we are going to play and push each other and it ’s really good			1
senior moment : @entity4 's @entity50 watch @entity8 's squad train ahead of their qualifier against @entity12 on friday @entity53 : @entity55 squad members from left - @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 ) video : @entity4 @entity55 watch @entity8 's behind - closed - doors session ... how the stand : @entity4 's group ' if anyone of the three played , then we ’d be in a strong position			1
' however , @entity1 will not give up his position easily			1
he said : ' i ’m in that privileged spot at the moment			2
i did n’t dream of this spot because i did n’t think it would happen			2
' i ’m doing what i ’ve always wanted to do , i love it , i ’ll keep working and training hard if there are no keepers or 1,000 keepers			1
group h : fixtures ' that no 1 spot is one i want to keep and last summer ( @entity86 2012 ) was a real high point in my career			2
“ it was one of the best footballing things i ’ve done			2
to play in a tournament like that is a dream			2
' @entity1 concedes himself and @entity32 have struggled to maintain last season ’s standards , but he still refuses to give up the title to @entity97			1
he said : ' my season has not been brilliant			2
it ’s had its good times but it ’s football			2
it ’s what i love doing			2
' i ’ve enjoyed it , it ’s been tough , things have n’t always gone my way			2
i ’m enjoying the fight and getting back in there			2
' sometimes you take knocks , that ’s football , you take opinions , but you ’ve got to be strong			2
' i feel strong , good , that i ’m doing the right things and hopefully i can have a good end to the season			0
' i understand you have your great nights and sometimes things do n’t go the way you want			0
that ’s the way it is			0
playing for keeps : @entity4 's goalkeepers ( from left ) @entity1 , @entity121 and @entity23 during a training session in @entity123 ' i ’m my strongest critic but i would never bury myself			1
it ’s pretty obvious when you make a mistake as a keeper , you do n’t need to dwell on it too long			0
' @entity1 added : ' with @entity32 , it ’s not been last year that ’s for sure			1
we are not in the position we want to be in			0
' we remain focused and hard on the case of what we need to do			0
we are still in one cup , a little further away than we would like to be in terms of the league			0
' but we need to nail down that second spot and in doing that it will push us to really go for the title as well			0
' you ca n’t not go for it			0
it ’s a long way off but we ’ve got an awful lot to fight for and it ’s a big couple of months for us			0
' meanwhile , the @entity11 fires are burning brightly for @entity149 now he has finally recovered from the achilles injury that threatened his international future			1
the @entity57 man returned from @entity33 requiring surgery on a long - term problem			0
@entity155 : @entity149 ( second right ) , @entity157 ( right ) , @entity158 and @entity159 ( left ) warm up at @entity21 ahead of the @entity11 qualification double - header the boss : @entity4 's manager @entity8 the operation kept him out until december , but after making 13 successive starts for @entity57 , @entity149 is feeling good again			1
and he is starting to train his sights on the greatest show on earth in @entity168 next year			0
' now i am amongst it again , the fire rumbles in my belly to get there for @entity168 , ' said @entity149			1
' i have not had many massive injuries in my career but the ones you do have give you that hunger again			0
' i need to take things one step at a time but , now i am in the squad , if i get my chance i need to take it			1
' @entity186 through his first major tournament last summer , @entity149 did outline a theory that it could be his last			1
still only 32 , it seemed an extreme assessment given his status as @entity4 ’s most natural defensive midfielder			0
yet part of @entity149 ’s thinking may have been formulated by the knowledge his troublesome @entity196 injury , which flared up towards the end of last season , was going to need sorting out			1
and , as the former @entity201 man is acutely aware , nothing can be taken for granted in the recovery stages from such significant surgery			0
' i did n’t really have any pain during @entity33 but there was a slight problem with my achilles during the summer and in the end i needed to have an operation , ' said @entity149			1
' and if you ask any player when they have been out for some time , doubts do cross your mind about when you are going to come back			0
' there are long days when you are feeling unfit and everything seems a struggle			0
then negative thoughts do set in			0
' but once you are out of pain and on the road back towards playing again , your focus changes			0
' although @entity149 has not featured for his country since that disappointing penalty shoot - out defeat by @entity226 in @entity227 last june , the experience of being in @entity222 and @entity223 has fuelled a passion to be part of another major tournament with @entity4			1
' i had a fantastic time at the @entity86 , ' he said			0
' it was a great experience for me and it did explode at quite a late age but i would love to be involved in a @entity11 squad			1
' a lot can happen between now and then			0
if i can stay fit and maintain my form hopefully i will have a chance			0
