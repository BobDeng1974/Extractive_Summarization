by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:17 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 17:23 est , 22 april 2013 @entity4 ’s plan to enshrine an increase in foreign aid into law has been shelved , it emerged yesterday			0
the government is committed to fixing international development spending at 0.7 per cent of @entity10 , one of the highest levels in the western world			1
increasing foreign aid is an article of faith for the prime minister , but he is opposed by many @entity20 mps who want it cut			1
prime minister @entity4 , pictured today during an q&a session in @entity23 , has promised to pass the 0.7 % target into law before the 2015 election all three main parties signed up to the policy before the last election and the @entity30 and @entity31 wrote it into the coalition agreement in 2010			1
the @entity33 has been ready for more than a year , with ministers promising it will be introduced when time allows			2
the rumoured omission will delight many @entity20 mps who have called for rises in foreign aid to be curbed and protections lifted at a time when other areas such as defence and police are suffering budget cuts			1
the @entity48 ’s @entity47 , published in january , stated : ‘ we have committed to increasing overseas aid to reach 0.7 per cent of @entity50 from 2013			0
’ it would mean that future governments would have to change the law if they wanted to cut overseas aid below the @entity55 target - met for the first time by the @entity57 this year			1
chancellor @entity58 announced in last month 's budget that @entity57 would meet the target this year but campaigners fear that a failure to include it in the government 's agenda for the year ahead announced by the @entity65 on may 8 would indicate a waning commitment to fulfil the promise by the end of this @entity69			1
mr @entity4 's official spokesman today told a @entity72 media briefing : ‘ the position is as set out in the coalition agreement , which the mid-term review clearly restated			0
’ the spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the @entity80			0
in last month ’s budget , chancellor @entity58 said that the @entity57 was already meeting its target without it being set down in law			1
he told @entity38 : ‘ we deliver in this coming year on this nation ’s long - standing commitment to the world ’s poorest to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on international development			1
‘ we should all take pride , as i do , in this historic achievement for our country			0
as previously , the @entity93 budget will be adjusted to ensure we do n’t spend more than 0.7 per cent			0
’ @entity94 , head of advocacy at development charity @entity96 , said : ‘ news that the government may be dropping its long - standing commitment to legislate to spend 0.7 % of national income on aid is extremely disappointing			0
‘ to do so would break the promise made by all three political parties at the last general election to the @entity57 people and to the poorest people in the world			2
‘ we know that aid is most effective when it is predictable and so the certainty provided by legislation is crucial			0
now is the time to enshrine that commitment in law , not to back away			0
’ the row comes as international development secretary @entity115 said more @entity57 aid money must be spent on ' disaster proofing ' earthquake - prone countries			1
today she visited @entity57 - funded projects in @entity120 where a catastrophic tremor left 230,000 dead in 2010			2
in the wake of the @entity124 earthquake in @entity125 , @entity126 , international development secretary @entity115 promised more @entity57 aid for quake - hit countries miss @entity115 said saturday 's deadly quake in rural @entity126 which killed at least 200 people and injured more than 11,000 was a fresh reminder of the fact that natural disasters tend to ' hit the poorest hardest '			1
miss @entity115 said the @entity57 could not just wait for the next natural disaster she said : ' @entity57 is a world leader in humanitarian emergency response but it makes complete sense to invest in helping @entity120 to take earthquakes and hurricanes in its stride			2
as the devastating earthquake in @entity126 this weekend has shown , natural disasters hit the poorest hardest			0
' there is no point in getting involved only when the latest catastrophe hits if we know that simple improvements to infrastructure and training people to consider the risks of natural events mean that the country 's development is not wiped out every time a major disaster strikes			2
' miss @entity115 was in the @entity158 nation - one of the most natural disaster - prone on the planet - with former @entity162 prime minister and head of the @entity165 @entity164 and @entity166			1
@entity57 has devoted £ 10 million to dealing with the aftermath of the @entity120 earthquake - almost a quarter of the 1.5 million displaced people remain in camps - and helping it prepare better for future disasters			1
miss @entity115 used the visit to announce a £ 300,000 project to provide legal support and counselling for up to 500 victims of rape and violence and build ' safe spaces ' for up to 300 girls aged 10 - 14			2
' improved rights and safety for women is just one ingredient necessary for @entity120 to have a social , physical and financial infrastructure able to withstand setbacks and to continue on its path to development and growth , ' she said			0
' @entity120 can only have a bright future if @entity120 of both genders play a full and confident role in building prosperity			0

all main parties said it should be written into law to prevent cuts in future
move is opposed by some @entity20 mps at a time of *austerity* in @entity57
@entity33 will not be included in next month 's @entity80 , say *reports*
international development secretary @entity115 says more money must be sent to earthquake - prone countries
