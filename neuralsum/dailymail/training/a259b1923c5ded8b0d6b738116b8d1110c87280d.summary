by @entity0 published : 15:35 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 15:35 est , 15 march 2013 in the leafy avenues and boulevards of @entity4 a very middle - class protest has erupted over the future of just one tree			1
the old elm tree has stood in the same place for more than 170 years , surviving two world wars and the ravages of @entity11			1
ironically the threat to its future existence comes not from some private owner or property developer but from @entity18 ’s first ever @entity17 council			1
locals have started a protest as they oppose the destruction of a 170 - year - ol elm tree in @entity4 the protesters have occupied the tree while posting messages and posters opposing the destruction of it the council says the roots of the elm are causing major problems on the pavement and the road and is also posing difficulties for wheelchair users and prams			1
and the local authority says the only way to solve the problem would be to fell the 60ft tree close to the @entity43 roundabout			1
the plan has caused uproar among the middle classes and trendy inhabitants of @entity48 who have decided to occupy the tree			2
protesters clambered up the ancient elm while others have turned to a more artistic forms of expression to voice their opposition			1
a message and poem that was posted onto the tree explaining why it should be kept poems , ribbons , pictures of weeping faces have all been pinned to the tree as part of the protest to stop the bulldozer moving in			2
@entity68 , who owns the @entity69 in @entity4 , is one of the protestors who climbed the tree to prevent the felling			2
he said : ‘ most people in the area do n’t want this going ahead			0
we will stay up here until they tell us they will not cut it down after all			0
’ the green party council say that the tree 's roots are causing disruption for prams and wheelchair users on the pavement the local @entity88 mp @entity87 has come down on the side of the protestors not the council another protester said : ‘ this is a fairly organic protest , it has n’t been strictly organised but local people feel so strongly about it they have just turned up to show their support			1
those protesting argue that tress makes up a vital part of the planet 's eco system and should not be destroyed for petty reasons ‘ we already have 5,000 signatures from locals and businesses showing their support			2
the elm is a healthy 60ft tree and i ca n’t see how it is in the way of their plans			1
’ the row has also led to a very public difference of opinion between green mp @entity87 and @entity4 ’s green - administration leader @entity118			0
the mp has come down on the side of the protesters saying : ‘ i have been written to by many constituents who are deeply concerned that as part of plans for this area there are plans to remove this tree			2
it is very clear to me that this tree is hugely loved by many people who do n’t want to see it come down			0
’ @entity4 and @entity132 say the tree would be felled as part of the improvement scheme but around 8 - 10 new trees will be planted			0
the council said : ‘ it is causing increasing structural problems to the surrounding pavement and carriageway			0
' the tree is also causing the adjacent pavement to become very narrow and uneven which can cause problems for people in wheelchairs or with buggies , and there are concerns that visibility to the new zebra crossings will be obscured if it is left in place			0
’ @entity4 and @entity132 say the scheme will improve the visual aspect of the area , the pedestrian environment and cycling infrastructure and the road design and layout			0
the move has caused an uproar amongst @entity4 's environmental population last night @entity163 , the council executive director , said : ‘ we are listening to concerns and ensuring that the issues surrounding this project are fully understood			1
‘ any matters raised will be carefully looked at by council officers			0
we are very much committed to working together with interested parties to move the scheme forward			0

the @entity17 council said the tree created a *hazard* for wheelchair users
locals have occupied the old elm tree in opposition to the move
the tree has survived two world wars and @entity11
