by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:32 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 05:58 est , 9 october 2013 @entity3 politicians have been accused of trying to ‘ offload ’ @entity5 refugees on @entity6 in a growing row over who should give them asylum			1
scores of @entity5 have occupied the @entity13 ferry terminal including a dozen who are on hunger strike and two threatening to kill themselves if they are not given safe passage to @entity6			1
but a @entity3 mep has come under fire after urging the @entity21 to back their call to be allowed into @entity6			1
about 40 @entity5 have refused to move from a passenger gangway			0
ahead of a debate in @entity33 , @entity3 mep @entity31 wrote to all meps with a message from the refugees in which they complain they are sleeping outside ' just because we have chosen to go and live in @entity39 '			1
she said : ‘ considering the debate we have today on the @entity44 's response to the flow of refugees as a result of the conflict in @entity5 , i would like to convey the call from @entity5 who are now in @entity13 ( @entity3 ) and want to reach @entity6 to apply for asylum			1
’ but @entity6 politicians are outraged at the suggestion that @entity3 should not take responsibility for people in their own country while viewing the @entity6 as a ‘ soft touch ’			1
@entity56 mep @entity55 wrote back to miss @entity57 : ' since they are already in @entity3 why do n't you propose that @entity3 offers them asylum ? ' about 60 @entity5 refugees , of whom 40 are on a hunger strike , have occupied a key point in the northern @entity3 port stand off : @entity3 @entity68 riot police stand guard as @entity5 asylum seekers occupy the ferry terminal in @entity13 ' first of all , we are very thankful to what have already been done for the @entity5 people who suffer from disastrous killing			1
' children , women , men and even animals and plants are being killed or destroyed			0
so , we feel that there are some sides which are being fed on the @entity5 blood because till now no one can stop this terrible war			0
' firstly , we want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the @entity5 are facing in some parts of @entity89 especially in @entity3 and @entity90			2
' for example , in @entity13 , @entity3 , we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in @entity39			1
in other hand , in @entity90 the police take our prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else			0
' secondly , we hope all @entity89 countries to do what @entity101 has done to save the @entity5 people			0
we also hope to make the asylum procedure faster to reunion and stop the pain			0
' the @entity5 in @entity13 are insisting to go to @entity39 which we want to show that it stands and support the @entity5 people and it should try to find a way to take us from @entity13 , @entity3			1
' finally , we need immediate action in order to save humanity and peace in @entity5			0
' we also beg you to do it fast because our families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to @entity39 as fast as possible to work and send them money			0
' mr @entity55 , the @entity6 @entity56 ’s spokesman on security and defence , said later : ‘ the suggestion that @entity5 refugees in @entity13 should be sent post-haste to @entity39 is absolutely outrageous			1
‘ these people have made their way across @entity89 with the intention of landing up in the @entity6			0
this is contrary to the @entity124 on refugees that says they should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to			2
‘ they want to come to @entity6 because of our reputation as a soft touch			0
they may indeed be refugees , but they are attracted to @entity6 because of the generous housing , benefits , and social services systems made available to foreigners			2
‘ if they @entity3 have not prevented their entry into @entity3 , as they were entitled to do under the @entity124 , then the @entity3 should offer them asylum , not try to offload the problem onto the @entity6			2
’ when @entity3 riot police tried to clear the refugees at the weekend , two men climbed on to the roof of the ferry ticket hall and threatened to jump			1
others erected placards reading : ‘ we want to start a new life in @entity39 ’ and ‘ we want to talk to @entity148 ’			0
many said @entity6 was a ‘ better ’ place to settle , despite @entity5 ’s close historical links with @entity3			2
in the message circulated to @entity153 , in broken in @entity39 , the @entity5 's describe themselves as being ' stucked in @entity3 '			2
they add : ' we want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the @entity5 are facing in some parts of @entity89 especially in @entity3 and @entity90			2
' for example , in @entity13 , @entity3 , we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in @entity39			1
' in other hand , in @entity90 the police take our prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else			0
' we also beg you to do it fast because our families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to @entity39 as fast as possible to work and send them money			0

a dozen refugees are on hunger strike at the @entity13 ferry terminal
two *vowed* to jump off the roof of the building unless demands are met
they claim to have been treated ' like dogs ' by the @entity3 *authorities*
