acceptance : @entity12 and @entity72 said they accept the @entity1 's apology but said they 'd like to see the agents better trained in sensitivity and how to handle children and those in wheelchairs @entity17 magic : @entity13 went to @entity17 , and got to meet @entity80 while she was there happiest place on earth : the family of five made it to @entity17 in one piece and posted this snap on @entity87 ‘ it bothers me because my daughter was singled out specifically because my daughter is in a wheelchair , ’ mr @entity19 told @entity63			1
as @entity92 reports , the @entity91 were attempting to fly to @entity40 to enjoy a family vacation at @entity17 and were flying out of @entity94 in @entity4			1

according to the @entity1 website , ‘ passengers who can neither stand nor walk will be screened by a thorough patdown while they remain seated			2
’ the site adds : ‘ a patdown procedure is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology			0
’ checkpoint : the @entity1 states on its website that those in wheelchairs and scooters who can not walk must go through a comprehensive patdown the government agency offers a notification card for those with medical issues , but it is clearly stated on the card that presenting it to agents does n’t exempt passengers from screening			2
