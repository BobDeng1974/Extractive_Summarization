by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:18 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 has a point when he says @entity5 is a specialist in failure			1
it is all @entity5 has known since 2005 – no other top club in @entity9 would accept this state of affairs			1
whether you love @entity5 or not , whether you buy the excuse about the stadium or not , @entity14 have been without a trophy for too long			1
it really is that simple			2
the pomposity of the @entity5 supporters out there among the press and in football has been cringeworthy			1
they ’ve wasted no time accusing @entity3 of lacking class			1
was what @entity3 said any more insulting than @entity5 telling his own fans that fourth place is a trophy ? but did @entity3 need to say what he said ? he could have made his point in a more subtle fashion , that ’s for sure			1
that would probably have had more impact			0
( please do n’t include the @entity51 as meaningful success for @entity14			0
it ’ll be a good day out for the fans , but that ’s all			0
they ’ve waited too long to settle for the trophy @entity56 won last year			2
) 2 ) @entity3 ’s response to being humiliated by @entity58 in @entity59 ( when @entity60 lost 5 - 0 at the @entity61 ) was to get very personal with his rival			1
in the short - term it worked , @entity58 was exhausted by it all and quit , @entity3 won a title , but ultimately left the job in disgrace and widely considered more a failure than a success			1
getting personal did n’t work back then , and it may not work now			0
3 ) @entity3 has once again made himself the only mouthpiece for @entity44 - the figurehead and the chief representative of the club			1
this power trip contributed massively to his downfall first time at @entity77			0
and his departure at @entity79			0
and his fallout with the hierarchy at @entity60			0
@entity3 had won a lot of admiration after @entity44 ’s brilliant win at @entity85 in the @entity39			1
i do n’t know why he decided to pick on @entity5			1
@entity3 ’s trophy success stands up comfortably against @entity5 ’s , so maybe the @entity44 boss should pick on someone his own size			1
they ’re both in @entity92 for massive @entity94 games this week , but for me @entity95 are still in @entity97 ’s shadow			1
sure you can throw last season ’s semi-final at me , where with @entity100 unfit but playing in the first leg - unable to play in the second leg - the @entity102 totally swept @entity97 aside			1
they ’ve gone 46 games unbeaten in the @entity105 – they ’re a fantastic side			0
think again ! @entity95 are still in @entity97 's shadow - despite winning the @entity40 last year but i ’m talking about @entity97 at their peak , who won three @entity40 finals in six years			1
the third success , at @entity111 against @entity112 in 2011 , had even sir @entity113 admitting he could n’t compete with such a brilliant side			0
@entity113 had a tactical plan to exact revenge on @entity58 after the defeat in the final in 2009 in @entity119 - one he had his players practising for 10 days up to the final			0
but not even the great sir @entity113 could match @entity58			0
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 were all singled out for criticism by @entity113 , but in truth @entity112 were second best in all departments			0
during their dominant era , @entity97 absolutely overwhelmed @entity60 with a stunning display of beautiful passing and devastating finishing , not once but twice : there was the 6 - 2 win at the @entity136 with @entity138 ’s right foot on fire , and with @entity100 and @entity140 totally dominating @entity142 ’ side on their own patch ; and then there was the 5 - 0 mauling at the @entity61 , @entity3 ’s first @entity146 , a beautiful team display of perfect football			1
habit : @entity97 have won @entity9 's premier competition three times in the last eight seasons - including 2011 difficult : sir @entity113 admitted the @entity153 were just too good for @entity112 at @entity111 down and out : @entity97 were so good in their 5 - 0 win against @entity60 in 2010 that @entity155 dumfounded easy ! @entity156 carried this front page after a super @entity100 display on virtually a weekly basis , @entity97 played some mesmerising football in @entity161 and the @entity40			1
it was a joy to watch			0
they still hit those peaks now of course , but not as regularly			0
as @entity166 said this week , the fear factor around @entity97 has waned a little			2
@entity97 ’s era of dominance in @entity9 lasted for at least six years			2
@entity95 have been top dogs for only a year and a half so far			2
they have finally put @entity171 in their place , but needed to spend an absolute fortune to do it			0
@entity40 defeats in the past 12 months at home against @entity14 and @entity85 , both yet to be true winners in @entity9 , cost them very little in the bigger picture , but hint at a fragility undermining claims @entity180 are better than @entity97			2
let ’s pay due respect to what could turn out to be the best club side we ’ll ever see in our lifetime			0
@entity97 deserve more respect than to be considered second best to this @entity95 outfit			1
have the @entity188 reached the levels over a sustained period of time that @entity97 achieved ? not in my opinion , not yet			2
@entity194 ’s @entity97 were the very best			2
@entity194 ’s @entity95 have a long way to go before comparisons can properly begin to be made			1
growing : @entity58 's @entity95 have a long way to go in their quest of replicating @entity97 's dominance @entity200 are being laughed at across the country			1
@entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 are all managers , and have all at some point this season been hired by the club			0
if things are n’t going well , just keep appointing managers seems to be the logic			0
in the meantime players are coming and going – indeed two players – @entity216 and @entity217 - were deemed surplus to requirements in january , yet while @entity200 hurtled headfirst towards the bottom of the table , these players were picked up by @entity223 and @entity224			2
both have already scored for their new clubs			0
potted : @entity200 dispensed of @entity203 as manager after less than three months in charge incoming ! @entity206 has been brought in to try and arrest the slide to the championship it ’s a club on the face of it blundering its way towards the @entity230			1
but there is another way of looking at events at @entity238			0
it takes a brave chairman to admit he got something wrong with such regularity			0
and if he ’s prepared to face up to his own mistakes , and make a wise choice in rectifying the problem , he should be rewarded at the end of the season			0
sticking with the wrong manager ca n’t be a good idea			2
but change is only good if the right man is brought in			0
let ’s see if @entity206 is better than the four other managers given various roles at @entity200 this season			2
one that got away : @entity217 ( left ) has already made an impression by scoring at @entity223 tactical masterclass : @entity259 switched formations three times during the win at @entity263 on monday night i took my son to @entity263 to watch our club , @entity266 , try to get to @entity111 for the @entity268			1
we witnessed a tactical masterclass from @entity259 – he changed formation three times in the second half , ending up virtually 3 - 6 - 1 to seal a draw on the night - and a show of nerve during the penalty shootout , ending in @entity266 booking their trip to @entity111			1
it ’s the stuff memories are made of – me and my boy will be talking about it for years			2
it ’s the kind of night that makes a boy proud to support his club , while the other kids at his school in the @entity287 support @entity288 , @entity14 , @entity112 and @entity44			1
@entity266 fans will have a great day out at the very least this season – and that means even though we support a small club , in a lower division , we will enjoy our season far more than the vast majority of supporters across the country			1
the fans of @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 and others wo n’t have a day out at @entity111 , or a comparable high this year			0
big night ! @entity0 and his son celebrate as @entity266 progress at the @entity307 off to @entity111 ! @entity266 reached the @entity268 final after the penalty shootout win bleak : peterborough are likely to enjoy more success than @entity112 this season you see it does n’t matter what division you ’re in , or what competition you get to the final of			1
what matters is that the team you love give you great times			0
and there is no doubt my team did that on monday night			2
even @entity112 fans are unlikely to enjoy anything remotely close to the kind of excitement my son and i will have as we build up to the big day , and then head to @entity111 itself for the game			0
the @entity113 family still have something to shout about , despite @entity112 ’s season from hell .			0

@entity3 was spot on to lay into rival @entity5
but @entity44 boss should pick on someone his own size
@entity95 have a long way to go if they want to replicate @entity97
manager *fiasco* leaves @entity200 the laughing stock of the country
