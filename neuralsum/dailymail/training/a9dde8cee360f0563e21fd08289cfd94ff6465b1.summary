by @entity0 disgraced @entity1 has returned home to @entity3 to a hero 's welcome despite being kicked out of the @entity6			1
standing on the deck of his mother 's home in @entity11 , near @entity12 , he looked carefree as waved to crowds while holding his son @entity14 and daughter @entity15			0
while @entity14 might not yet be old enough to know not to sink his teeth into others , perhaps @entity15 could teach her father a thing or two about acceptable behaviour			0
fans flocked to @entity37 to greet the arrival of the banned striker who was handed a nine - game international ban and four - month suspension from all football			1
supporters turned out in force to greet the @entity28 star , with some wearing masks as a tribute			1
@entity50 president @entity49 was at the airport at one point , but returned home because @entity1 's flight was delayed			1
because of the delay , the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await his arrival			0
@entity1 fans flocked to @entity37 to greet him , some with oversized images of his face @entity1 was still very much a super star in his home country , with fans holding cutouts of his head aloft @entity1 was earlier seen with the rest of the team in @entity31 as they were pictured arriving at their hotel			1
the @entity73 are preparing an appeal against the severity of the sentence , which also includes a £ 64,000 fine			2
but there is no chance of @entity1 appearing at @entity80 2014 again			2
@entity82 ’s strict regulations barring him from any involvement in football mean he can not even watch @entity28 or @entity3 in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from @entity28 ’s @entity88 training ground			1
@entity1 can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but can not personally join in negotiations in mooted moves to @entity35 or @entity94			1
biting may have got @entity1 kicked out of the @entity6 and banned from all football for four months , but that did n't stop his fans from making fun of his sinister move while they awaited his homecoming @entity28 are taking specialist legal advice before deciding what to do about @entity1 — a world - class footballer who comes with more baggage than any other elite star			1
given the length of his ban , @entity28 , who have not been contacted by @entity82 or the @entity3 @entity109 , feel aggrieved to be punished for something in which they had no part			1

it ’s an extremely excessive punishment , there was not enough evidence and i have seen more aggressive incidents			0
it feels like @entity3 have been thrown out of the @entity6			0
we all know what @entity1 means to @entity3 and to football around the world			1
@entity1 will travel home to recover with his family			1
’ following this third , high - profile biting incident , it is no surprise that @entity1 ’s major sponsor adidas are thinking of ditching him			2
he has already been punished for racially abusing @entity135 and biting @entity136			0
@entity1 can be seen biting the shoulder of @entity139 @entity138 in this still from tv footage of the game a statement said : ‘ @entity144 does not condone @entity1 ’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players			2
we have no plan to use @entity1 for any additional marketing activities during the @entity6			1
we will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with @entity1 and his team after the tournament			2
’ another of @entity1 ’s backers , 888poker , are likely to drop him , with a spokesman saying : ‘ 888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			2
’ the independent @entity82 disciplinary committee , chaired by @entity165 of @entity166 , reached the decision to hand @entity1 a @entity6 record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over wednesday night and thursday morning before it was announced at @entity82 ’s daily briefing at the @entity171			1
the player and the @entity3 @entity109 had been informed minutes beforehand			0
the suspension starts with immediate effect			0
the committee took into account that this was the third time @entity1 had bitten an opponent			2
his first victim was @entity181 ’s @entity180 in 2010 , for which he received a seven - match ban , and then @entity183 ’s @entity136 in 2013 , which brought a 10 - game ban			0
@entity165 said : ‘ such behaviour can not be tolerated and in particular not at a @entity6 when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field			0
the disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of mr @entity1 ’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code			0
’ the @entity50 media claimed that @entity165 ’s committee had come under pressure from @entity204 chiefs , including the @entity207 - hating @entity206 football president @entity205 , not to punish @entity1 too severely			1
but @entity82 insisted that there was no interference at all in the process			0
the world body ’s president @entity211 had been in @entity213 watching @entity166 beat @entity214 and flew back to @entity31 while the @entity1 hearing was going on			1
meanwhile , the @entity216 , who made @entity1 their player of the year last season , decided not to strip the @entity28 star of his title			1
@entity3 face @entity33 in the last 16 on saturday @entity223 defender @entity222 said the team were ‘ more united than ever ’ , while the country ’s sports minister @entity225 commented : ‘ we are hurt by this excessive sanction			0

’ @entity234 ’s @entity82 vice-president @entity233 said : ‘ the punishment is fully justified			0
