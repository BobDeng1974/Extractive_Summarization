by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 has two words for those who want president @entity5 to deport @entity6 : no comment			1
it looks like @entity6 wo n't be going back to @entity9 any time soon			1
despite nearly 275,000 non-beliebers who signed an internet petition calling the @entity9 - born teen idol reckless and asking @entity5 to revoke his green card , the @entity2 says it 's sorry to disappoint , but it wo n't be commenting			1
the government promises to review a petition once it receives more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days			1
the baby singer got that amount in only six days			0
the @entity2 is citing a caveat that allows it to decline to address certain petitions			1
playing it safe , president @entity5 's administration said : ' sorry to disappoint , but we wo n’t be commenting on this one , ' have n't they enough on their plate ? : the @entity2 promises to review all petitions that receive 100,000 signatures in a month - @entity6 got that amount in six days but the politicos could n't resist getting one message across , adding : ' we ’ll leave it to others to comment on mr. @entity6 ’s case , but we ’re glad you care about immigration issues			1
because our current system is broken			0
' too many employers game the system by hiring undocumented workers , and 11 million people are living in the shadows			0
' they argue that an immigration overhaul could shrink deficits by nearly $ 1 trillion over two decades			0
the @entity2 says that 's equivalent to 12.5 billion concert tickets — or 100 billion copies of @entity6 's debut album			1
the petition , titled ' @entity72 and revoke his green card , ' was launched the same day news broke about the @entity76 's brush with the law			2
just six days later , the petition topped 100,000 signatures , the threshold needed for a @entity2 response			1
in trouble : @entity6 was photographed for the records by @entity84 after his arrest for alleged @entity86 , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license on january 23 it 's official : the @entity34 page on the @entity2 's website had 273,968 signatures as of saturday morning the petition starts , ' @entity94 … would like to see the dangerous , destructive , and drug abusing @entity6 deported and his green card revoked			1
' it also states : ' he is not only threatening the safety of our people , but he is also a terrible influence on our nation ’s youth			0
' @entity34 would like to remove @entity6 from our society			2
' then 19 , the troubled star appeared glassy - eyed when he was booked at @entity106 at around 4.30am			0
toxicology reports revealed he was still under the influence of marijuana and also had @entity110 in his system			0
the @entity2 response took far longer than normal as requests from such petitions are usually answered in 30 days			1
the @entity116 hitmaker pleaded not guilty to charges of @entity86 , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license			0
his trial is due to begin on may 5 in @entity121			1
@entity6 's criminal defense attorney has denied that prosecutors have offered a plea deal in the case			2
@entity126 - who defended @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 among others , says that no plea deal was offered and his legal team is ' vigorously preparing ' for the upcoming trial			0
is he a @entity134 ? : president @entity5 - who welcomed the singer to his home in 2010 - is not commenting in 2012 a petition was filed to have @entity139 deported but it did n't work			0
he is still living in @entity140 with his family			0
despite @entity6 's recent offenses that included a dui , resisting arresting and driving on an expired license , he would have had to have done something much more severe , like murder , to get kicked out of the @entity24			2
it was highly unlikely that the petition would eve have amounted to anything more than a bit of teasing			0
@entity6 has already performed for @entity5 's two daughters @entity153 and @entity154 - who are big fans of the star - at the @entity2 in 2010			1
however , it 's fair to say that @entity6 has done nothing to help his public image since his run - in with the police in @entity121			1
not the tv attention he wanted : the pop star , then 19 , appeared in a @entity106 court via closed circuit tv as the judge set bail at $ 2,500 so much has changed in five years : the star in 2014 ( left ) and in 2009 ( right ) after holing up in a @entity106 rental with his father @entity170 , aged 38 , and model @entity172 , aged 21 , he went to @entity26 with his entourage to film a music video on the beach			0
his manager @entity176 as well as his mentor @entity177 and mother @entity178 had visited the star in the tropical location urging him to get help			0
no comment : the @entity2 says it ¿ s sorry to disappoint , but it won ¿ t be commenting			2
it ¿ s citing a caveat that lets the @entity2 decline to address certain petitions			2

@entity6 , who is a citizen of @entity9 and has a performer 's visa , is unlikely to face deportation
the petition *garnered* far more than the 100,000 signatures needed to *trigger* a response from the @entity2
it became one of the site 's most popular online petitions ever
@entity6 is set to face trial on may 5 in @entity121
