by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:54 est , 25 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:10 est , 26 december 2013 one 15 - year old boy with cerebral palsy got a very special @entity6 gift this year -- the ability to communicate with his family with words for the first time in his entire life			1
@entity12 , a high school student from @entity13 , gathered with friends at the @entity15 on @entity16 on monday night to accept his gift of a hands free eye - gaze communication device from the @entity20			1
@entity12 suffers from cerebral palsy , a disease that keeps him from speaking , eating anything through his mouth , even swallowing his own saliva , reports the @entity26			1
@entity27 gives an eye - gaze communication system courtesy of the @entity20 of @entity13 to 15 - year - old @entity12 and his family @entity12 has never said the words , ' i love you			1
' but his mother can read the emotion in his eyes			0
the machine also relies on the user 's eyes in order to create a tool for communicating thoughts and feelings with words --- or in the case of the machine , menu choices			1
the machine employs imaging technology that creates a computer portrait of the user 's eye			1
after calculating the location of the user 's gaze on the computer screen it allows the user to hold his or her gaze on a menu option			1
@entity12 is able to create words and sentences by holding his point of view on a specific option or menu choice			2
using the machine has been an extraordinary challenge for @entity12 because he suffers from nystagmus , a condition characterized by involuntary eye movement			1
the machine operates by locating where the eye is looking			2
since @entity12 suffers from involuntary eye movements he has had to endure copious amounts of therapy in order to learn how to use the machine properly			1
his teacher @entity81 along with others at @entity84 's special education program have helped him control his eye movements enough so that he use the machine to its fullest			2
with practice , @entity12 has been able to control his eye movements so that he can use the communication device which relies on taking a digital portrait of his eyes in order to help him communicate verbally @entity92 , ceo or @entity94 that assists thousands of disabled residents in @entity96 and all over the world spoke highly of the communication technology that is still in development			1
' it 's an extraordinarily liberating thing , ' said @entity101			0
' @entity12 's family not only believes he can communicate , but that he can communicate everyday			1
at one time , @entity104 could n't tell his family he needed to go to the bathroom			0
he could n't make jokes or express his complex thoughts in a way that his family and others could understand			2
@entity104 can not read , so for now his use of the machine is with pictures			0
he can recognize images pertaining to the bathroom , hunger , or thirst			0
with time , his use of the machine will become mature as he matures			0
he 's a teen : @entity12 's menu options reflect his youthful personality and he can say things like , ' hey pretty lady ' gifted : @entity12 's father thinks the device will help his son to learn and that he may end up to be the next @entity127 ' there are times when something is wrong , and he tries to get our attention , ' said his mother to the @entity134			1
' we know he needs something			0
what we 've always done is try to guess			0
' unfortunately , after months of learning how to use the communication device , @entity104 's family cold not afford to pay the $ 6,000 it would cost to keep the machine the family tried to get coverage for the machine under their insurance company for over a year but were continuously denied			1
the @entity20 decided to grant @entity12 's wish to keep the machine so that he could build relationships with those around him			1
' we call it the power of wish ' said @entity154 , a spokeswomen for the @entity20 in central @entity13			0
@entity12 was overcome with joy on monday night when he unwrapped his eye - gaze machine			1
@entity12 is 15 years old and his parents say that his menu choices on the machine reflect his youthful energy			2
' he 's kind of a little flirt , ' his mom said , laughing			0
' he has one that says , ' hey , pretty lady			0
' ' the system will grow with @entity12 , ' his teacher @entity81 said			0
' the more he learns , the more it will grow with him			0
' @entity12 's father @entity170 , greatly supports his son 's progress			2
' @entity12 has a lot of love to share with the world , ' he said			0
' who knows , we may have another @entity127 here , ' he told the @entity26			0
his father also ca n't wait for his son to say things like , ' go @entity182			0
' the family keeps a blog to document @entity12 's progress called ourlifewithraymond.blogspot.com for those who wish to read more			2
@entity12 's father hopes that one day he can say things like , ' @entity189 ! '			2

the @entity20 gave @entity12 , 15 , a $ 6,000 machine he can use to form sentences and express his needs
@entity12 suffers from cerebral palsy , a disease that keeps him form speaking , eating anything form his mouth , and even swallowing his own saliva
the machine creates a digital portrait of @entity12 's eyes so that when @entity12 stares at a menu option on the device 's computer screen , it communicates what @entity12 is thinking
@entity12 also suffers from nystagmus , a condition that causes involuntary eye movement , so @entity12 has had to work extremely hard on controlling his gaze so that he may use the machine
the family tried to get coverage for the machine under their insurance for over a year but were denied
