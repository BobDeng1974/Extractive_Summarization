by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has thrown his hat into the ring for the @entity6 job after @entity7 became the first managerial casualty of the new season on thursday			1
the former @entity11 boss was immediately installed as 3/1 favourite for the vacancy in @entity14 following the shock sacking of @entity7 and his father @entity16 , @entity6 ’s director of football			1
and @entity2 , who won the @entity17 with the buddies in 2013 but was replaced as manager by assistant @entity20 in may , expressed his interest by describing the @entity23 outfit as ‘ a model club			1
’ ' @entity25 ' : former @entity11 boss @entity2 is favourite to take over at @entity6 slump : @entity6 have lost four consecutive league games this season former @entity28 boss @entity27 will also be a strong tip , but @entity2 said : ‘ it is an attractive proposition and it certainly interests me			1
i spent time at @entity6 towards the tail end of my ( playing ) career and it is a lovely place with lovely people			2
‘ the northerly location might put some off , others might be put off by the success @entity7 had and think he ’s taken @entity6 as far as they can go			1
‘ personally , i think a great foundation has been laid for someone to go and pick that up and take over			0
they have a great stadium , great facilities and , in many ways , they are a model club			0
despite four straight defeats in the @entity46 , @entity7 launched a spirited defence of his @entity6 record after being told on wednesday night that he was being dismissed			1
chairman @entity49 said terminating the @entity7 ’ contracts was the most difficult decision he had made in football , but hinted that a breakdown in relations was a key factor			2
coach @entity56 and captain @entity58 will take charge for tomorrow ’s game with @entity61			0
a bitterly disappointed @entity7 released a statement citing his pride in taking @entity6 up through the divisions to the @entity46 and to a @entity66 final on a budget substantially lower than top - tier rivals			1
defiant : @entity7 defended his record in a statement following his release ‘ i have always believed the test of a manager is in consistently outperforming his resources and i believe i achieved that with @entity6 , ’ it read			1
‘ i have watched with immense pride as @entity6 has grown from the @entity77 through two promotions to the @entity46 , where we are now in our third season			1
‘ the fact we achieved this progress while setting an unbeaten record in @entity87 league football for the modern era of 40 matches and reaching a @entity66 final along the way gives my coaching team and myself great satisfaction			0
‘ considering that @entity6 has had i believe one of the lowest , if not the lowest , wage bills in the league in the last couple of seasons , i believe this shows our @entity98 has notched victories against the @entity100 of @entity87 football more often than we might have reasonably expected			2
‘ this is most clearly demonstrated by our victories against @entity104 , especially in the @entity66 semi final when at that time we were a @entity106 side			0
‘ as part of the financial realities of working at @entity6 , i have become accustomed to working in a challenging environment			2
‘ for the last few seasons while working with a low wage budget , we have had to build almost entirely new teams to start each season without ever spending a transfer fee - a massive challenge that we have been able to meet by retaining our @entity46 status			2
family affair : @entity7 father @entity16 was also sacked as director of football ‘ while this has been extremely challenging , i believe it makes the journey we have taken even more remarkable and i am very proud to have been a part of it			1
’ chairman @entity49 surprised journalists with an unscheduled appearance at a routine press conference due to be attended by @entity7 yesterday , before admitting ‘ chemistry ’ had been a factor in the dismissals			0
declining to expand on his reasons , the club owner paid tribute to both @entity7 and @entity135 , but admitted he is likely to scrap the director of football role			1
‘ we have nothing in mind , ’ said the @entity6 chairman			0
’ we have to sit down and look at it			0
‘ will it be a director of football and manager again ? i doubt that will happen			0
it will be a different relationship			0
by and large it worked for us , but it is very unusual nowadays in @entity87 football			0
