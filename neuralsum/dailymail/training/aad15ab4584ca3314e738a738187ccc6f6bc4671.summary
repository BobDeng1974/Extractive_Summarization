by @entity0 published : 16:45 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 16:46 est , 20 september 2013 @entity1 was engulfed by bitter recriminations yesterday after a new book reopened the wounds of the @entity5 years			1
@entity6 was forced to deny claims from former spindoctor @entity8 that he knifed his politician sister @entity9			1
the shadow foreign secretary is said to have told @entity11 ‘ that she had to quit ’ following a row about donations to her @entity16 @entity1 leadership campaign			1
allegations : @entity8 claims that @entity6 , left , knifed hi politician sister @entity9 , right , allegations that he denies ‘ if i was sometimes cold - blooded about how i did my job , i had nothing on @entity6 that day , ’ mr @entity8 wrote in his memoir			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i always supported my sister and i never supported @entity8			1
that might explain why he writes about me in those terms			2
' he was discredited when he left @entity27 and that ’s really all there is to say			0
‘ the style and approach of the politics he embodied has been completely discredited and thankfully the @entity1 has moved on			0
' i support @entity36 ’s efforts to remove that type of politics from our party			0
’ when asked whether mr @entity8 was lying , mr @entity6 replied : ‘ it ’s what @entity8 does			1
’ explosive allegations : @entity8 made a series of claims in his new book the @entity47 asked his sister yesterday about the claims and she simply said ‘ i ’ll leave that ’ before closing the door			1
a senior @entity1 source said : ‘ @entity8 helped us lose the last election and now it looks like he ’s trying to lose us the next one as well			1
’ mr @entity8 revealed in his book that he sought to end the careers of former home secretaries @entity57 and @entity59 by leaking damaging allegations about them			1
neither was prepared to comment yesterday but @entity63 , another @entity1 home secretary , rounded on mr @entity8			1
he said : ‘ it takes no intellectual effort at all to churn out scurrilous tittle tattle and to rubbish those who you were supposed to be supporting , and whose lives were spent improving the wellbeing of others			0
‘ i had very few dealings with @entity8 and no policy or campaigning contact with him at all			1
' this now turns out to be extremely fortunate			0
it also demonstrates that , whatever @entity8 thinks , the world did not revolve around him or his machinations			1
’ @entity82 ’s former spindoctor @entity81 tweeted : ‘ politics is a team game and the best players are the team players			0
‘ @entity11 had many many strengths and did some great things			1
but why he needed people like @entity8 and @entity89 [ is ] a mystery			2
’ @entity91 , who was former health secretary @entity92 ’s special adviser , said : ‘ usually i do n’t get agitated but this @entity94 stuff is really p * * * ing me off			0
’ hitting out : @entity63 rounded on mr @entity8 and his ' scurrilous tittle tattle ' @entity96 , an adviser to the former deputy prime minister @entity97 and @entity98 @entity99 , suggested mr @entity11 should have fired mr @entity8 , who was branded ‘ @entity101 ’ by his critics			1
‘ i never witnessed anything like @entity104 confession , ’ he wrote			0
‘ both my ministers would ’ve sacked me forthwith			0
’ @entity106 , who worked for @entity107 , said : ‘ exactly			0
i had a very clear understanding of what was acceptable and what was not			0
@entity111 would have meant exit			0
’ in a bizarre echo of the @entity5 wars that tore @entity1 apart for a decade , @entity113 – a former aide to @entity114 – yesterday sought to undermine mr @entity8 ’s revelations			1
he leaked his @entity27 emails at the time of the ‘ @entity120 ’ , in which mr @entity11 ’s allies succeeded in forcing @entity82 to name a date for his retirement			2
mr @entity113 calls mr @entity94 ‘ @entity124 * * * kface ’ in the emails			0
he wrote yesterday : ‘ @entity11 ’s team were convinced the answer to every problem which @entity1 faced was that @entity82 should go			2
‘ the sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not reflect well on any of the participants – me included			0
everyone who participated in them , from ministers , mps , advisers and many more civil servants than is ever acknowledged , should reflect on what else could have been achieved if we were n’t fighting			0
’ mr @entity8 hit back , saying : ‘ i suppose the virtue of publishing old emails and diaries is it does n’t require any self - criticism from those whose egos prevent that			2
’ @entity147 , @entity1 communities spokesman , told the @entity148 : ‘ this is the past , we ’ve changed			2
‘ some of what happened is pretty unedifying but it is a postscript on the past			0
@entity8 in the end lost his job , and rightly so given what was revealed , but that was a long time ago			2
