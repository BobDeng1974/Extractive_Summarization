@entity0 is facing an excruciating choice - deciding which handful of @entity3 patients will receive an experimental drug that could prove either life - saving or life - threatening			1
@entity6 , the untested @entity3 drug , arrived in the @entity9 country late yesterday			1
@entity0 's minister of foreign affairs , @entity10 , couriered the two boxes of @entity12 himself on a commercial flight from the @entity14 to @entity15 , where it was unloaded at a @entity18 terminal			2
the government has said two doctors will receive the treatment , but it was unclear who else would			0
these are the last known doses of @entity6 left in the world			2
the @entity14 - based company that developed it has said it will take months to build up even a modest supply			0
@entity9 's ebola virus outbreak has overwhelmed the region 's already strained health systems and sparked an international debate over the ethics of giving drugs that have not yet been tested for safety or efficacy to the sick			2
the charity group @entity75 , which is running many of the @entity3 treatment centres and whose staff have tussled with whether to provide @entity6 , said such choices present ' an impossible dilemma '			1
crisis : policemen dressed in riot gear disperse a crowd of people that blocked a main road in @entity15 after the body of someone suspected of dying from the ebola virus was not removed by health workers tensions : @entity9 's ebola virus outbreak has overwhelmed the region 's already strained health systems and left people living in a climate of fear and confusion over a disease that is killing half the people who get it now @entity0 officials are facing those questions			1
the first @entity0 patients expected to be given @entity12 will be @entity31 and @entity32 , two doctors who caught ebola virus while treating patients			2
' the criteria of selection is difficult , but it is going to be done , ' said dr @entity110 , who helped @entity0 obtain the drug from @entity112			0
' we are going to look at how critical people are			0
we are definitely going to be focusing on medical staff			0
' dr @entity110 said people who were past the ' critical phase ' and looked likely to survive would not be treated with it			0
the @entity120 told @entity121 only around 10 to 12 doses of the drug have been made and this raises difficult ethical questions about who should get priority access			2
the worst - ever outbreak of @entity3 has already claimed the lives of 1,069 people and there are 1,975 probable and suspected cases , the vast majority in @entity134 , @entity0 and @entity135 , according to the @entity137 health agency			1
the doctors will be the first @entity47 to receive the treatment , though it has already been given to a @entity51 priest who later died and two @entity14 aid workers who are reported to have shown signs of recovery			2
authorities are also concerned that @entity6 's unproven status could leave them open to the charge that humans are being used as guinea pigs			1
' this is not the panacea to the problem			0
it is at the risk of the patient , ' @entity0 's assistant health minister @entity55 told journalists at @entity15 's main airport			2
information minister @entity160 told @entity121 the drug merely offered a ' glimmer of hope ' and its use was little more than a gamble			0
a woman prays at an @entity167 in @entity15 : the worst - ever outbreak of @entity3 has already claimed 1,069 lives and there are 1,975 suspected cases , mostly in @entity0 , @entity134 , and @entity135 ' glimmer of hope ' : @entity0 information minister @entity160 said the new drug was little more than a gamble a boy rests as his father reads the @entity178 : there are mixed opinions in @entity0 regarding use of @entity12 even so , the clamour for it is strong given that the contagious haemorrhagic disease is killing more than half of its victims and there is no known cure or vaccine			1
if you bring them the medication it will make them stronger to fight @entity3 , ' said stationery seller @entity200 , in @entity15			2
but highlighting the dilemma , @entity202 , the first @entity0 doctor to survive @entity3 , said he would not have used @entity6 when he was fighting for his life because @entity14 authorities said they were not responsible for any adverse effects			1
' any drug that has not been approved by @entity208 should not be administered , ' he told @entity121			0
and doctors treating a @entity135 physician , dr sheik @entity210 , defended their decision not to give him the experimental drug , saying today they feared it was too risky			1
calling it ' an impossible dilemma , ' @entity75 explained in detail last month 's decision in response to a @entity219 story on the case			1
it would have been the first time the experimental drug was tried in humans but at the time that the experimental treatment was being considered for dr @entity210 , his immune system was already starting to produce antibodies suggesting he might recover , @entity75 said in a statement			1
dr @entity210 was also due to be transferred to a @entity231 hospital that would be more capable of handling problems that might arise , it said			0
the men in white suits : health workers arrive to bury the body of @entity237 who succumbed to the deadly ebola virus along with her husband @entity240 and daughter @entity240 in the village of @entity243 , @entity0 testing : health workers take blood from @entity246 , whose parents and sister succumbed to ebola virus			1
@entity246 , 15 , tested negative for the virus but is still shunned by his fellow villagers the youngster shows where he sleeps : @entity255 , some 90 miles from the @entity0 capital @entity15 , is at the heart of one of the quarantine zones established in a desperate bid to try to contain the spread of ebola virus one of the epidemic 's most tragic consequences is the toll on health care workers who have become infected themselves due to inadequate protection or diagnoses of patients that came too late or were inaccurate			1
the @entity120 said this week that 170 health care workers had been infected and at least 81 had died			1
another @entity135 doctor , @entity274 , became the latest medical practitioner to die of @entity3 , a health ministry spokesman said on tuesday			1
he contracted the disease after treating a patient who later proved to have the virus and died			2
his death followed that of dr @entity210 , @entity135 's leading @entity3 doctor , who was offered @entity12 , only for medics from @entity75 to decide no to give it to him			1
the experimental drug , @entity6 , is designed to boost the immune system to help it fight the virus			1
since dr @entity210 's body was already producing an immune response , the doctors may have feared that any boost would kick it into overdrive			0
in the end , the treating physicians decided against using the drug			0
they never told dr @entity210 of its existence because they felt it would be unethical to tell him of a treatment they might not use			0
shortly after their decision , however , dr @entity210 's condition worsened , the statement said , and the company providing the medical evacuation decided not to transfer him			0
he died a few days later , on july 29			0
' every day , doctors have to make choices , sometimes difficult , about treatment for their patients , ' said the @entity75 statement			2
' trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult decision , particularly in the light of the " do no harm " principle			0
' meanwhile , eight @entity320 health workers are in quarantine in @entity135 because they may have contracted @entity3 , according to the spokesman for the @entity320 embassy in @entity324 , @entity325			1
the seven doctors and one nurse treated patients at two @entity320 - run hospitals in @entity324 who later died from @entity3			1
one of the doctors has emerged from quarantine after a 21 - day observation period , mr @entity331 told @entity121			0
@entity3 is real : a sign warning of the dangers of @entity3 outside a government hospital in @entity324 , @entity135			1
two doctors in the country have died from the virus and eight @entity320 health workers are in quarantine there despite the stir caused by @entity6 , preventive public health measures will be crucial to containing the outbreak , according to the @entity137 health agency			1
as a result , @entity9 and other governments , including some which have seen no cases of the virus , have taken measures intended to prevent the spread of the disease			0
@entity355 has decided to close its frontier with eastern neighbour @entity134 , prime minister @entity354 told a news conference			0
@entity360 on today urged its nationals to leave @entity0 , @entity134 and @entity135 , though the request did not apply to medical workers or @entity360 diplomatic staff , a foreign ministry spokesman said			1
the outbreak has brought fresh attention to efforts to find a cure			0
scientists in the @entity14 studying @entity3 say they have found how it blocks and disables the body 's ability to battle infections in a discovery that should help the search for potential cures and vaccines			2
the scientists found that @entity3 carries a protein called @entity378 that interferes with a molecule called interferon , which is vital to the immune response			0
' one of the key reasons that ebola virus is so deadly is because it disrupts the body 's immune response to the infection , ' said @entity388 of the @entity389 , @entity27 , who worked on the study .			0

@entity6 drug poses ethical dilemma for authorities over who to treat
who figures show 1,069 have died of @entity3 and 1,975 more are sick
@entity320 health workers are held in quarantine in @entity135
@entity75 defend not using @entity12 on patient last month
