by @entity1 reporter space - age slap : the new @entity3 by @entity4 , which already has a waiting list of 12,000 women who are keen to get their hands on it thousands of women are clamouring to sign up for a designer foundation that claims to use space - age technology to keep it working for 24 hours			1
nearly 12,000 women are already on the waiting list for @entity4 ’s @entity3 – three weeks before it is released nationwide			1
the hi - tech make - up contains a material called lipophilic acid , which is used to capture space dust			1
this interstellar ingredient makes the product the most technologically advanced make - up in the world , say @entity4			2
the microscopic substance absorbs grease from the face , leaving an even , matte surface for up to 24 hours			1
this is because the lipophilic acid has a honeycomb - shaped texture , allowing it to absorb up to four times its own weight in moisture , it is claimed			1
the formula also contains a ‘ hydrophilic agent ’ – a clay - like mix of minerals which acts like ‘ an invisible sponge ’ , soaking up moisture from the face , as well as a ‘ beautyleaf extract ’ designed to mimic the fatty acids found on the surface of the skin			0
@entity41 , @entity4 's scientific communications director , said : ' @entity3 is a ground - breaking response to modern demands for trustworthy , perfect coverage that lasts for up to 24 hours without compromising on texture			1
' this combination of active agents is a first for @entity48			0
@entity3 contains a new blend of hydrophilic and lipophilic agents and tamanu oil			1
' this hybrid technology means the volatile oils in the foundation evaporate quickly after application - leaving just the pigments and actives behind on the skin			0
' created by @entity48 skincare laboratory in @entity61 , the formula contains ' pure , milled pigments each with a micro-coating that merges perfectly with the surface of the skin , thus ensuring it remains uniform , weightless and long - wearing , ' @entity4 said			2
model @entity66 , the face of the new @entity4 product : the hi - tech make - up contains a material called lipophilic acid , which is apparently more commonly used to capture space dust creative director of make - up at @entity4 , @entity76 , said : ' other formulas tend to be quite thick in texture , a little heavy and form a barrier on the skin			1
this has a lightness of texture which is completely new			0
' as a make - up artist , my criteria for foundation are that i do n't want to see it on the skin , it has to be invisible and weightless			0
' so the aim was to create a weightless formula with an invisible , long - lasting coverage and that 's what we have			2
it has a natural - looking , mattifying effect on the skin - without appearing dry or caked on			0
and it lasts the entire day			0
' @entity4 claimed that unlike other foundations , this product is not too heavy and will not form an impenetrable barrier over the skin			2
the dispenser for the foundation was inspired by the way a calligrapher would dip his quill in a pot of ink , which @entity4 said was designed to eliminate the fashion faux - pas of applying too much make - up			2
it said the dispenser 's plume is fanned at the base and tapered at the tip , which it says allows the optimum amount of foundation onto the skin without any surplus			0
the foundation will be available exclusively from @entity121 from august 10th and then nationwide from august 20th .			0
