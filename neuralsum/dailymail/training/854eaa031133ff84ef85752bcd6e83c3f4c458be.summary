by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 19:33 est , 16 november 2012 @entity1 yesterday told of his fury at being ' sullied ' by association with the @entity5 child abuse investigation			1
the former radio 1 dj denied any wrongdoing after being released by police investigating accusations of sexual assault made by two women dating back to the late - 1960s			1
he said the case against him amounted to nothing more than allegations of ' fumbling ' , adding : ' i do not want to be sucked into anything that talks about paedophilia			0
' i think that sometimes us guys who are a bit older are , shall we say , tactile – which is not a terrible thing to be			0
in the old days you put your arm round someone and gave them a kiss or a cuddle , yeah , that 's fine			2
nowadays you 'd have to stop to think – is this an assault ? ' now i 'm not saying that i have n't put my arms around someone and i 'm not saying that any of this is right or wrong at the moment			0
but i 'm just trying to get the facts out ... ' the 67 - year - old @entity60 continued : ' things were different in those days … those were lax days			1
' several claims have already been made that @entity1 groped women colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s			1
tv and radio broadcaster @entity65 claimed he ' jiggled her breasts ' while live on @entity68 in the 1980s			2
mrs @entity65 , 55 , claimed @entity1 clamped his hands over her jumper as she made a live announcement			1
@entity1 categorically denied any wrongdoing and said he was surprised the allegations were being made now			1
upset : @entity74 came out of his house in @entity76 and said he spoke out because he did n't want to be ' linked to something that bloody evil ' he said : ' we are not talking about rape or attack or anything like that			0
it 's not as if someone has to keep this quiet			2
if something like that happened you say , “ hey , he grabbed my boobs ”			2
' he added : ' of course i 've groped women 's breasts , @entity98 i 'm a man			1
women have groped me as well			2
anxious : @entity1 said he had to speak out because he did not want to be mentioned in the same breath as @entity5 ' i 'm a human being i 'm a man			1
but i have never walked up to a woman and groped her without her knowing			0
' the former @entity60 's main anger was the way his arrest had been linked to the investigation into paedophilia involving some of his fellow former celebrities			1
he said : ' my name appeared in papers alongside @entity114 and @entity5 – that 's not on			1
' he added : ' this is nothing to do with kids , all right ? i do n't want to be even mentioned in the same breath as @entity5			0
' he said he had no warning that he was about to be arrested at his home in a small village in @entity123 at just before 8am on thursday			1
he spent over 12 hours at the station where he drank hot chocolate and ate a cheese and tomato sandwich			0
he said he had given the opposite of a ' no comment ' interview			0
' it 's not my style			2
i have lots of comment			0
i answered every question they asked me			0
' yesterday it was announced that @entity1 has been taken ' off air with immediate effect ' by radio station @entity140 after his arrest			1
a spokesman for @entity143 which owns @entity140 said : ' while we can make no judgment on the matters under investigation , we believe it would be inappropriate for him to broadcast until they are resolved			1
' police said the allegations against @entity1 did not directly involve @entity152 , and were classed under the strand of their investigation termed ' others '			2
÷ two more celebrities are to face legal action from @entity159 for falsely implying he was a paedophile on @entity160			0
the unnamed pair join @entity162 and @entity164 columnist @entity163 , and each could be forced to pay the peer up to £ 100,000 for spreading untrue gossip			0
statement : the @entity60 , who has been suspended by @entity140 , said that he is accused of ' jiggling ' the breasts of two ' grown women ' @entity1 and @entity5 pictured together on @entity172 's @entity171 in 1975 the mammoth payouts would reflect the fact that the four prolific @entity160 users have hundreds of thousands of followers			1
the speaker 's wife has already been sent a letter by the wronged peer 's lawyers urging her to apologise and agree a damages settlement , it is understood			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
