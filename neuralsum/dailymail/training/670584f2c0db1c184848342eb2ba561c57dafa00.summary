by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 8 april 2013 the terrifying moment two skydivers almost collided thousands of feet above ground has been captured on film			2
the pair were falling at up to 240mph when they missed each other by centimetres			1
both skydivers were freeflying and had not yet pulled their parachute , meaning a collision would almost certainly have been fatal if either had been knocked unconscious			0
the close call was captured by mr @entity12 's helmet camera as he jumped from the plane			1
the @entity23 dare - devil immediately begins a head - down skydive but within seconds his friend can be seen hurtling straight towards him			1
with minimal control , the quick - thinking skydiver manages to curl up just as his friend plummets past			1
mr @entity12 lifts his knees up and his friend also pulls his limbs into his body as they narrowly avoid colliding			1
he said on his @entity32 page : ' thing happens very fast in freeflying , and we were lucky this time			0
' safety first , know your limits			0
' @entity39 is a more extreme version of skydiving and participants travel at up to double the speeds of a normal ' belly - to - earth ' fall			0
the dive began uneventfully but within moments his head camera picks up his friend hurtling towards him the pair only avoid missing one another by curling up their legs and arms the speed of the fall means jumpers have to be extra careful to avoid collisions with other skydivers , who will be travelling slower			1
it is not clear where their dive took place			0
in december , a skydiver in his 30s died after colliding with another parachutist above @entity65			2
he was knocked unconscious and landed outside the designated zone , according to police			0
in 2011 , @entity68 died following a jump at @entity70 , near @entity71 , @entity72 , when he collided with skydiver @entity73			0
mr @entity73 pulled on his brakes when he realised mr @entity68 was below him but could not stop his knees hitting his friend 's canopy and their parachute lines became tangled .			2

@entity12 and his friend missed each other by centimetres
@entity12 's helmet camera captured the skydiver hurtling towards him
they only avoid each other by pulling their legs and arms out of the way
