by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 10 january 2013 the @entity1 has formally declared that a future daughter of the @entity3 and @entity4 will be a princess			1
with a long - awaited royal baby due in late spring or early summer , the monarch has issued what is known as a @entity9 to announce that the couple 's baby would become an @entity12 – his or @entity12 – even if she is a girl			1
in doing so , she rectified a century - old anomaly that meant a royal daughter would not automatically become a princess			1
parents - to - be : the @entity3 and @entity4 on the balcony at the @entity18 during a visit to @entity20 a decree made by @entity22 in 1917 stipulated that while a son would become a prince , a daughter would not become a princess			1
the king had ordered that the titles @entity12 and prince and princess should be restricted to the children of the sovereign , the children of the sovereign 's sons , and the eldest son of the eldest son of the @entity38			2
that means that princess @entity40 and princess @entity41 automatically had the title of princess at birth as prince @entity46 's daughters , but @entity47 did not – although her mother , @entity48 , had already rejected titles for her children			2
prince @entity52 's son and daughter were similarly entitled but he and his wife @entity54 chose for them to be styled as the children of an earl in order to give them a more ' normal ' childhood			0
they are now known as @entity61 and @entity62 , @entity63			0
royal sources said the @entity1 felt it was time such a long - standing imbalance was formally rectified			1
the @entity1 's proclamation was issued through the @entity68 on december 31 but made public only yesterday			2
the @entity1 rectified a century - old anomaly that meant a royal daughter would not automatically become a princess pregnant @entity4 and @entity72 , pictured outside hospital in december , have yet to reveal the due date of their baby it reads : ' @entity1 has been pleased by @entity9 under the @entity78 dated 31 december 2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of the @entity38 should have and enjoy the style , title and attribute of @entity12 with the titular dignity of @entity38 or princess prefixed to their @entity86 names or with such other titles of honour			1
' while the announcement is no great surprise , it is , nevertheless , an important milestone for the future third in line to the throne			0
@entity9 are a form of public proclamation and a rare exercise of extra-parliamentary power by the sovereign – although they tend to be issued with informal government approval			0
@entity102 refused to comment last night on the timing of the announcement and whether it meant that @entity4 was now safely past the crucial 12 - week stage of pregnancy			0
however , well - placed royal sources suggested that the @entity1 had been keen to make the announcement for some time			2
the duchess , who celebrated her 31st birthday yesterday , was taken to hospital in early december with acute pregnancy - related sickness and has retained a low profile ever since			0
last month the @entity114 was published , proposing to end the system of male primogeniture , meaning the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity20 's first child would succeed to the throne regardless of gender .			0

@entity1 issues the @entity9 - declaring @entity12 *credentials* of *unborn*
in doing so she makes *historic* *change* to a @entity22 decree
until now , a royal daughter would *n't* automatically become a princess
