by @entity0 most of us like to dab on a little perfume in the morning but , for most of us , the fragrance only lasts until lunchtime			0
now a jewellery brand has come to the rescue of those who hate carrying clunky bottles around , courtesy of a set of pendants and bracelets that emit fragrance			0
although obo bijoux look like stylishly modern jewels , each pendant is actually a mini perfume bottle that can be detached from the chain and used in the same way as a roll - on scent			2
looking good : a model poses in an obo black and white bracelet which contains a mini perfume bottle while the perfume inside lasts no longer than a regular scent , around six hours , wearing it around your neck means no more carrying bottles around			0
' the simple idea behind @entity33 is to apply perfume , anytime and anywhere , ' explains designer , @entity36 , 29 , from @entity37			1
' we wanted to make a beautiful accessory that can perfume your skin			0
' mr @entity36 , who is currently running an @entity43 crowd - funding campaign in an attempt to raise the money to put his big idea into production , hopes the product will find favour with busy women hoping to make their life a little bit easier			1
and to ensure the final design is completely fool - proof , he has been conducting an extensive series of tests to rule out embarrassing spillages			0
stylish : a £ 49 obo perfumed cuff ( left ) and the perfumed pendant , which will cost £ 57 , left ' the perfume is leak - proof and it has been tested under high pressures to ensure that our roll - on gives the same results as a classic pump dispenser , ' he reveals			1
the obo range , which comes in a choice of black or white bracelets and necklaces , uses magnets to attach the perfume bottles to their chains and will cost between £ 49 and £ 57			1
once launched , the range will include eight different fragrances , which will be sold in sets of three capsules alongside the jewellery			2
' we worked with the perfumers @entity82 and @entity85 - @entity84 and they created eight unique fragrances , ' adds mr @entity36			1
' each piece of jewellery contains around 3ml of perfume which gives between 20 and 25 applications on the skin			0

@entity36 , 29 , from @entity37 , is the designer behind the new obo range
mr @entity36 is running a crowd - funding campaign to pay for production
once launched , jewels in the range will cost between £ 49 and £ 57
