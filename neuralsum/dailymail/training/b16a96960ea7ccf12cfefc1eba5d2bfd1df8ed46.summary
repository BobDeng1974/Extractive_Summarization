how will the universe end - with a bang or with a whimper ? according to this video it is very much the latter , but only after all life on @entity7 has long since disappeared			2
host @entity8 ( @ jtotheizzoe ) takes us on a journey from near future to far future , and ultimately shows us how the universe might come to an end			1
he says that within 500,000 years we can expect a climate - altering large asteroid to hit our planet , while in a billion years all life will be gone in the video called ' the @entity26 ' he starts with the postulation that most people on @entity7 alive today wo n’t be around in 100 years			1
in a closed universe , gravity will halt the expansion and the universe contracts into a single point , known as the @entity34			2
in an open universe , as described in the video , the universe will continue to expand forever until all the stars go out , known as @entity39			1
this concept is discussed brilliantly in @entity42 ’s short story ‘ @entity43			0
’ finally , in a flat universe , the cosmos continues to expand forever but at a decreasing rate , ultimately reaching the same fate as an open universe			1
in 100,000 years the position of @entity7 in the @entity50 will have changed to such a degree that the constellations will look completely different in the night sky			2
any time in the next 500,000 years , meanwhile , we can expect @entity7 to be hit by an asteroid large enough to significantly alter our climate			0
in 600 million years photosynthesis becomes impossible as too much carbon dioxide gets trapped in @entity7 's crust			0
a billion years from today all multicellular life , including us , will be eradicated as the sun boils our oceans and destroys our greenery according to @entity8			1
‘ we would n’t want to be around for what comes next anyway , ’ he jokes			0
in 600 million years the sun will have caused so much carbon dioxide to be trapped in @entity7 's crust that photosynthesis will cease says @entity8 , leading to all multicellular life being eradicated			0
by the billion - year mark , all oceans and life will have disappeared from the surface of @entity7 , leaving it looking somewhat like @entity75 in four billion years our @entity50 will collide with the @entity77 but , owing to the huge spaces between stars , it is unlikely many collisions will occur			1
in fact , it 's possible that only six out of a total of a trillion stars will hit each other at the four billion year mark , our @entity50 galaxy collides with the @entity77 but , although they will interact , most of the galaxies are empty space			1
this means that only about six out of a trillion stars might actually collide			2
in 7.9 billion years , when our sun runs out of gas , it starts to expand and consumers the inner planets @entity97 and @entity98 before deflating into a white dwarf 1.6 billion years later			1
about 150 billion years later , changes on the scale of the universe start to take place			1
as the universe expands , we would lose sight of all galaxies from @entity7 if we were still around as they are too distant for their late to reach us			0
at the trillion - year mark , stars stop forming , and 110 trillion years all of the stars will have exhausted their energy and flickered out			1
‘ this is where the sky goes dark , ’ says @entity8			0
in 7.9 billion years , when our sun runs out of gas , it starts to expand and consumers the inner planets @entity97 and @entity98 before deflating into a white dwarf 1.6 billion years later in 110 trillion years all stars will have died out while in a quadrillion years our planet , now a lifeless hunk of rock , will fall into what is left of the sun ( now a black dwarf ) as its orbit decays ultimately the universe will continue to expand until everything in it is dead			1
all matter will be so spread out than , in essence , nothing will remain and the cosmos will be completely empty , says @entity8 one quadrillion years from now , what remains of @entity7 is pulled into the black dwarf that is now the sun as its orbit decays			2
further ahead from this point , however , seems to be a bleak future for the universe			2
‘ anything that remains will be stretched so far apart that it really does n’t , and is n’t , matter at all , ’ says @entity8 in the video			0
‘ after that the universe is basically empty			0
’ this is , of course , just one theory for the end of the universe			0
others include the universe ending in a ‘ @entity34 ’ that in turn leads to another @entity153			0
whatever the case , however , our @entity7 will be long gone before the universe has even begun to edge towards its conclusion .			0

@entity159 called ' the @entity26 ' looks ahead trillions of years
it takes a look at the ' open universe ' *scenario* for the cosmos
this would see the universe continuing to expand until nothing is left
it also describes how our planet will be almost dead in just 1 billion years
and in 110 trillion years all the stars in the cosmos will have died out
