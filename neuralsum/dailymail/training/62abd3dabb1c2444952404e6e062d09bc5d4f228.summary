by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 17 july 2013 the proportion of @entity3 with dementia has unexpectedly fallen by about a quarter in the last twenty years @entity3 are less likely to develop dementia today than two decades ago , researchers claim			1
a major study found the chances of developing the disease in old age has fallen by a quarter since the 1990s			0
however , the overall number of dementia sufferers is on the rise because more of us live to an age when the illness is most prevalent			1
it is not yet clear why the dementia risk has dropped but the @entity20 researchers think it may be partly due to better treatment for heart disease – including improved uptake of drugs for high blood pressure – which could protect against dementia			2
it could also be down to improvements in education over the last century			0
children who stay at school for longer are less likely to get dementia later in life			2
but the researchers warned that dementia – including @entity38 – remains a huge burden on the @entity40 and society , which will only increase in the coming years			1
the study also found that the percentage of care home residents with dementia had increased from 56 per cent to 70 per cent , with fewer residents in better health			1
this places a considerable burden on staff and means patients may be at risk receiving of poor @entity54 researchers said the development could be because the elderly and frail are more likely to receive support at home from carers , using residential homes only as a last resort when they are too ill to care for themselves			0
the study , published in the @entity64 , followed 8,000 randomly selected over- 65s between 2008 and 2011 , recording how many participants had dementia			2
they compared the findings with the results of another group of 7,000 adults who had been followed between 1989 and 1994			2
the proportion diagnosed with dementia dropped from 8.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent over the 20 - year period , a fall of 24 per cent			1
a study of almost 15,000 people revealed that within the general population there are now 200,000 fewer cases than predicted two decades ago			1

but individually someone aged 65 has a lower risk than they did 20 years ago			1
‘ obviously as the population ages there will be more people in the 65 - and - over category			1
‘ we think that risk factors associated with heart disease have declined dramatically			0
’ researchers think that one cause may be the increasing use of drugs for high blood pressure such as beta blockers , which are thought to have a protective effect because they help maintain a steady flow of blood to the brain			0
another cause may be a fall in the numbers of smokers			0
tobacco is known to increase the risk of getting the disease			0
dementia prevalence is higher amongst women than men over 65 with 7.7 per cent thought to have dementia , compared to 4.9 per cent of men an @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ this interesting study could indicate that better heart health and education are combining to play a role in reducing dementia prevalence			1
‘ while this is good news , this is one study which needs careful examination and may not indicate a continuing trend			0
‘ dementia remains the biggest health and social care challenge facing the @entity3			1
’ dr @entity138 , editor - in - chief of the @entity64 said , ‘ a reduction in prevalence of dementia in the older population is an important and welcome finding			2
‘ but it is not a signal for government to deprioritise investment in dementia care and research			0
‘ dementia remains a substantial challenge for those affected , their families , the @entity40 , and the @entity155			0

there are now 200,000 fewer dementia cases than predicted 20 years ago
*670,000* people in the @entity3 have dementia compared to the predicted *884,000*
dementia is more prevalent among women - 7.7 **%** of women over 65 have dementia , compared to just 4.9 **%** of men
