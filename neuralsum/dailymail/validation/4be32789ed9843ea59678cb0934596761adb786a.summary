what do @entity1 , birthday cake and the way your eyes move have in common ? they 're all conspiring to get you to spend more money when you eat out			2
while we are all prepared to splash out in restaurants , it 's become clearer that restaurateurs have devised crafty ways to make sure we spend more than we had planned to			2
and while it might not seem unacceptable to charge corkage for when you bring your own wine to an eatery , there are now a number of @entity23 restaurants who charge cakeage fees - a sum to serve diners birthday cake - which can sometimes come up to £ 9 per person			1
playing with numbers and omitting dollar and pound signs restaurant menus tend to attach prices that end with the number nine to dishes as it indicates a bargain is being had			1
for example , a diner would be willing to pay for a dish that costs £ 19.99 then they would for something which is marked as £ 20			0
according to the @entity63 , prices which end with .95 instead of .99 are even more conducive to making people spend as they ' feel friendlier ' to diners			0
the publication reported : ' in the world of menu engineering and pricing , a dollar sign is pretty much the worst thing you can put on a menu			0
' @entity74 , a menu consultant in @entity75 said to news.com.au : ' dollar signs remind people of money			0
when you use dollar signs , your food looks more expensive			1
' a study by @entity85 's @entity84 , @entity86 , found that when dollar signs were left off a menu , sales increased by eight per cent			0
@entity91 's @entity90 in @entity23 's @entity92 ( pictured ) charges £ 9 per person for birthday cake anchoring another key trick is known as ' anchoring '			1
this is where a restaurant places a highly expensive dish prominently on the menu — solely in order to make the other dishes nearby appear relatively cheap			1
so the next time you see a £ 70 steak , look at the item below it , which will seem like a bargain when you compare prices			0
@entity112 , author of priceless : the myth of @entity115 said : ' restaurants do not expect to sell many of these costly ' anchor ' items			0
that is not their job — instead they are simply there to make the other dishes look like good value			1
' suddenly spending £ 21 on a plate of lemon sole does n't seem so outlandish			0
identifying body and eye language korean studies have shown that diners take an average of 109 seconds to read a menu			0
so menu consultants have a limited time to make their sell to us , which is why more expensive items of food are always place on the top right hand corner of the page ( this is where the eye naturally falls when we look at a page )			1
the most profitable dishes are usually placed there			2
this subliminal messaging also works in most printed matter , such as newspapers and magazines			0
menu boards which omit prices ( left ) and classical music such as works by @entity1 ( right ) are some of the ways restaurants make diners pay more for their experience tests , which were carried out over three weeks by @entity159 researchers , monitored the effects of classical , pop music and background silence on spending			1
they found that when subtle classical melodies were played , diners spent more than £ 24 per head on average on food and drinks			1
when pop music was played , less than £ 22 was spent by each diner and without any background music the spending fell to only £ 21.70 per head			2
in the same test , diners were spending over £ 1 each on coffee with classical music , compared to only 80p with pop music and 54p without any background noise			1
@entity183 , proprietor of @entity185 restaurant in @entity186 , where the research was carried out , said : ' the sort of music you play does affect people 's mood			1
' it is quite amazing how much it sets and creates an atmosphere in the restaurant			2
sometimes you play what you personally like rather than what the clients like , so i think this research will definitely affect what we play in the future			0
' overblown descriptive language how much would you pay for a chicken nugget ? we reckon not more than £ 2 at most			0
but what if you were presented with homemade chicken goujuns in a sesame seed crumb dusted with paprika powder and @entity213 sea salt ? then you might be more inclined to fork out in excess of £ 7 for what is essentially a jazzed - up @entity217 's favourite			0
the language used when writing a menu indicates the exclusiveness of the dish			0
this is why we now are now seeing incidences of heirloom vegetables , heritage potatoes and artisan breads popping up in every menu			0
sauce is now jus or froth , potatoes are ' lightly crushed ' and salad dressing is ' tenderly forked through '			0
professor @entity233 , a psychologist at @entity234 , the co-author of @entity236 : the @entity237 said : ' there 's research that demonstrates that if you give food a more descriptive label , people will enjoy it more — and they 'll also pay more for it			2
' one common example of this is to attach somebody 's name to a dish			0
for instance a lot of restaurants have dishes that include the name of the butchers or suppliers , which makes it seem like the dish has been carefully chosen – and thus justifying the price hike			1
manipulation through music while music may well be the food of love , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity1 could also burn a nasty hole in your pocket , research has suggested			1
scientists have discovered that classical music makes restaurant diners feel more affluent and encourages them to spend more money			1
the less sophisticated tones of @entity276 as background music saw people typically spending around 10 per cent less on their meals			2
researchers at the @entity159 found that classical music , often associated with affluence , was the most successful in encouraging people to part with their cash			1
when no music was played , the amount of money spent by diners was dramatically less			2
dr @entity288 , senior lecturer in psychology at the university , said : ' when you hear a piece of music it activates all types of knowledge			2
if you hear classical music , it has got all sorts of connotations of sophistication , affluence and wealth and it makes you feel a bit posh			1
' in a restaurant , this has the effect of making you spend a bit more money			0
where people were really spending the money was on the luxury items , such as starters , desserts and coffees			0
' @entity316 while corkage fees have become the norm , there is now a trend to charge diners ' cakeage ' for when they bring in their birthday cake			1
prices can go up to as much as £ 9 per person at @entity326 in @entity23 's @entity92 , which is the same price at dessert			1
@entity330 in @entity23 , charges £ 7 per person serving charge although their staff inform punters that they can provide a cake if you would rather that			1
fork out £ 45 for a medium or £ 65 for a large cake , depending on the size of your group			0
other restaurants charging cakeage include @entity345 's @entity344 and @entity347 restaurants in @entity23 , which demand £ 5 a head , and barbecue chain @entity349 's , charging £ 1.50			1
but some restaurants are still keen not to spoil the party			0
chain restaurants including @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity359 's @entity358 , @entity360 's and @entity361 's do not charge diners for bringing their own cake			2
@entity365 's bar in @entity366 does not charge cakeage ' as long as it 's not a five - tier cake that has to be wheeled in on a horse ' .			2

tricks include using only numbers to indicate price of dishes
@entity23 eateries introduced a per person charge for serving cake
classical music in a restaurant will make you order more expensive food
