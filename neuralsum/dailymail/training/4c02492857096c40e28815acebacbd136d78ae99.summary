' i am offended , outraged , and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the @entity29 from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner , ' @entity12 said in a statement			1
@entity37 's body was brought back to the @entity19 after being killed in @entity21 on october 6 , when his family was told the benefits payout was at risk respect : the @entity29 has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and secretary of defense @entity0 was at @entity14 when @entity37 's body arrived ' if @entity10 were trapped in a car that sunk down in a river , i would swim to the window , and i would look them all in the eye and say , " suck water , " ' said @entity52 , the father of 24 - year - old @entity53 who was killed in the field			1
earlier on wednesday , the @entity24 said president @entity55 was ' very disturbed ' when he heard about the lapse and had directed lawyers at the @entity29 and @entity24 budget office to find a way to immediately resume the payments			1
under the agreement , @entity61 will advance the death benefit to military families using its own funds until the @entity29 can reimburse it once the shutdown ends			1

' it is upsetting because my husband died for his country , and now his family is left to worry , ' @entity79 quoted his widow , @entity84 , as before the @entity29 announcement			0
' my husband always said if something happened to him we would be taken care of			0
' @entity89 senator @entity89 said on tuesday that members of @entity10 should be ' embarrassed ' and ' ashamed ' for the lapse			2

on tuesday , the @entity24 passed an act ordering that all military pay and allowances - including the death benefit - would continue to be disbursed			1
even with death gratuity payments resolved , the impact of a prolonged government shutdown could still be felt acutely by veterans throughout the country , @entity19 officials say			1
father : special agent @entity76 , 24 , leaves behind a wife and 20 - month - old son those injured in the @entity123 and @entity21 wars are among those who could see monthly disability and other benefits cut - off from november 1 due to projected cash crunch , the @entity121 warned @entity10 on wednesday			1

` the @entity61 will provide the families of the fallen with the benefits they so richly deserve , ` defense secretary @entity0 said in a statement , adding that the @entity29 would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ended			1
@entity12 said @entity61 , which works with veterans and their families , had approached the @entity29 about making the payments			1
the @entity29 typically pays families about $ 100,000 within three days of a soldier 's death , but officials say the shutdown was preventing those benefits from being paid			1
a senior defense official said the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations , but could accept an offer			2
determined : @entity172 speaker of the house @entity173 has tried to submit a bill approving the payment of ' death benefits ' to military families but @entity179 do n't want to take a piecemeal approach to the budget approval process the failure to make the payments has stirred outrage both on @entity185 and at the @entity24			1
@entity55 spokesman @entity186 said wednesday that the president was ` disturbed ` when he found out the death benefits had been suspended and demanded an immediate solution			1
` the commander in chief , when he found out that this was not addressed , he directed that a solution be found , and we expect one today , ` @entity186 said before the @entity29 announced the agreement with @entity61			2
the @entity24 unanimously passed legislation wednesday to restore the death benefits but it 's unclear whether the @entity179 - led @entity198 will take up the measure or whether @entity55 would sign it			1
@entity55 has threatened to veto other legislation passed by the @entity24 in recent days that would reopen individual funding steams , arguing that a piecemeal approach was unacceptable and the entire government must be reopened			2
the names of the five soldiers who were killed have been released - sgt @entity94 , special agent @entity76 , @entity37 , @entity102 lcpl @entity206 , lt @entity95 - and @entity209 reports that they are all under the age of 25 years old			2

mr @entity37 was not the only grieving family member to speak out , and a number of others have come forward			0
‘ the government is hurting the wrong people , ’ @entity224 , who lost her son , marine lance corporal @entity226 , over the weekend in @entity21 told @entity227			1
‘ families should n’t have to worry about how they ’re going to bury their child , ’ she added			0
‘ families should n’t have to worry about how they 're going to feed their family if they do n’t go to work this week			0
’ @entity235 was on his fourth deployment to @entity21 , he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier			2
‘ sgt. @entity94 was a brave and incredibly talented ranger , ’ lt. col. , @entity239 , the commander of the 3rd battalion , told @entity227			0

‘ tomorrow , the @entity24 is going to act specifically on this and i hope the president will sign it , ’ he said during a tuesday press conference			2
the payment of the so - called ' death benefits ' has become a political issue on its own as @entity173 speaker @entity173 has blasted @entity179 for failing to support his bill to fund the payouts before the budget is approved fully			1
' i think it 's disgraceful that they 're withholding these benefits , ' he said			0
the seemingly obvious move to pay the benefits is steeped in political motivations , however , as @entity173 and the @entity172 have repeatedly tried to push through smaller single - issue funding appropriations without agreeing to end the shutdown by approving an entire budget			1
president @entity55 was reportedly ' disturbed ' to find out that it would take longer than the standard three days to get the ' benefits ' to the relatives and press secretary @entity186 said that a solution would be found wednesday			1

' i 'm a stay - at - home mom , which is what my husband wanted			0
he wanted me to take care of our son			0
' the five soldiers whose funeral payments are being fought over are far from the only ones who face financial letdown			0
continued rhetoric : president @entity55 gave a press conference on tuesday saying that he would not negotiate under threat but @entity172 want certain services funded before approving the entire budget about 3.8 million veterans will not receive disability compensation next month if the partial government shutdown continues into late october , veterans affairs secretary @entity132 says			1
some 315,000 veterans and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped			0
@entity132 is spelling out some of the dire consequences of a longer - term shutdown in testimony wednesday for the @entity317			2
the short - term consequences have meant that disability claims production has slowed by an average of about 1,400 per day since the shutdown began october 1 , and that has stalled the department 's efforts to reduce the backlog of disability claims pending for longer than 125 days			2
in all , more than $ 6 billion in payments would be halted with an extended shutdown			0
' in some areas , like health care delivery , there are fewer adverse effects			0
in others , such as reducing the claims backlog , we have already seen a negative impact , ' @entity132 says in written testimony obtained by @entity338 in advance of the hearing			0
the @entity24 has passed legislation that would provide veterans disability , pension and other benefits in the event of a prolonged shutdown , but the @entity24 has pushed against the piecemeal approach			2
@entity132 plans to make that case as well , saying it 's not the best solution for veterans			0
he 'll note that even if the @entity353 were fully funded , some services to veterans would suffer .			0
