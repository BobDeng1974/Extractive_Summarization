scientists believe green tea could be used to develop drugs to fight cancer it has been shown to lower cholesterol , improve blood flow and protect against heart disease			1
and now scientists believe green tea could be used to develop new drugs to fight cancer			1
a chemical extracted from the beverage is an ideal carrier of proteins that combat the disease , according to research by the @entity18 , @entity19			2
green tea is made up of a class of chemicals called catechins , the most abundant of which is @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
it is believed @entity25 is responsible for green tea 's health benefits and could have anti-cancer effects			1
dr @entity30 and her colleagues have shown anticancer protein @entity33 can combined with @entity25 to form a stable and effective complex to deliver a drug to a tumour site			1
she said : ' when designing drug carriers , the drug to carrier ratio is an important consideration because the use of high quantities of carriers can result in toxicity as a consequence of poor metabolism and elimination of the carriers			0
' however , these issues would be of less concern if both the drug and carrier had therapeutic effects			0
when injected into mice , the @entity33 loaded nanocomplex demonstrates better tumour selectivity and growth reduction , as well as longer blood half life , than free @entity33			2
' ' it effectively protected the proteins against many obstacles from the point of administration to the delivery sites			0
the combined therapeutic effects of the green tea based carrier and the protein drug showed greater anticancer effect than the free protein			1
' the researchers injected the combination of @entity25 and @entity33 into mice and found it was better at targeting tumours and reducing growth , as well as lasting longer in the blood			2
it is hoped the finding reported in @entity80 could help build better drug delivery systems			0
when designing drug carriers several factors must be considered , including that it must be specific so it just attacks the cancer			0
using high quantities of the carrier could result in toxicity if the body can not metabolise it			0
the complex will be ineffective if the body attacks and eliminates it too quickly			0
a chemical extracted from the beverage is an ideal carrier of proteins that combat the disease , according to research by the @entity18 , @entity19			2

scientists believe green tea could be used to develop drugs to fight cancer
drink is made up of chemicals including @entity25 ( @entity25 )
researchers from @entity19 think @entity25 could have anti-cancer effects
it has been combined with anticancer protein @entity33 to target tumours
@entity18 and *nanotechnology* finding could prove crucial
