by @entity0 published : 15:12 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 20:55 est , 23 january 2013 a woman who lost her home and business when she split from her partner of more than three decades is a victim of sexist property laws , a top judge said yesterday			1
@entity6 , 55 , had worked with @entity7 , 52 , at his kennels and cattery			1
but after their relationship ended in 2010 , a county court judge ruled that she had no right to a share in the business , or the home where they had lived together			1
@entity6 , 55 , was left penniless when her 30 year relationship with @entity7 , 52 , ended but has been given the right to appeal a ruling that said she had no right to share the business or the home where they lived miss @entity6 was left penniless , with her belongings placed in storage while she stayed with any friends who could take her in			1
but she is now able to appeal the ruling after judge @entity30 said she is a victim of unfair and old - fashioned property laws that are biased against women of her age and position			1
‘ sadly , the appellant found herself in the classic position of a woman jilted in her early fifties , having very much made her life with the respondent for over 30 years			0
the law of property can be harsh on people , usually women , in that situation , ’ he said			2
‘ bluntly , the law remains unfair to people in the appellant ’s position , but the judge was constrained to apply the law as it is			2
’ the @entity54 heard that the couple began their relationship as teenagers in the @entity58 , and remained ‘ an item ’ until their split three years ago			2
they lived and worked together at @entity61 and @entity62 near @entity63 , @entity64 , which was bought in mr @entity7 ’s name in 2007			1
workplace : the couple lived and worked together at @entity68 , a kennels and cattery business near @entity63 , @entity64 which was bought in 52 - year - old mr @entity7 's sole name in 2007 miss @entity6 said she had ‘ trusted ’ in her partner that , if they ever split up , she would be given a ‘ fair share ’ of the property and business , bought for a total of £ 750,000			1
however , when the case reached the @entity81 last may , judge @entity79 concluded that the couple had not established a business partnership			2
miss @entity6 told @entity30 yesterday that she had put a lot of hard work into making the business successful , but was left with nothing to show for it			1
' sadly , the appellant found herself in the classic position of a woman jilted in her early 50s , having very much made her life with the respondent for over 30 years.the law of property can be harsh on people , usually women , in that situation			2
bluntly , the law remains unfair to people in the appellant ’s position , but the judge was constrained to apply the law as it is ' lord justice @entity30 ‘ i was absolutely stripped of everything , ’ she said , sobbing in court			1
‘ the person you see sitting here today is not the person i was , because i have been destroyed			0
’ lord @entity108 said judges ‘ ought not to be affected by human sympathies ; they must apply the law as they see it ’			0
however , he added : ‘ it was extremely difficult not to be affected by a sense that the appellant has , in truth , been treated unfairly			0
‘ she describes herself as a nobody , but with a profound sense that what ’s happened was not just			0
she says she worked really hard at the kennels and got nothing for it			0
’ he added that , given judge @entity125 said she believed miss @entity6 was essentially a truthful witness – and that mr @entity7 himself had at times suggested to third parties that the business had truly been a partnership – miss @entity6 should have permission to bring a full appeal against the initial decision			1
mr @entity7 was neither present , nor represented at the hearing			0
a report published by the @entity135 in 2007 had recommended that property laws be reformed as they were unfair to those in @entity139 ’s position			0
the body wanted to give those in cohabiting relationships the same rights as married couples in order to ‘ reflect the growing prevalence and public acceptance of cohabitation ’			0
however , the government announced in 2011 that it had no plans to change the law .			0
