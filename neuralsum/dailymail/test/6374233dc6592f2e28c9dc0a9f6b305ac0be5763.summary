@entity1 's grip on the @entity3 title was loosened further after a controversial @entity5 goal put @entity6 on the way to a 2 - 1 victory			1
@entity5 fired @entity6 ahead in the first half , despite both he and @entity10 appearing to be offside , and @entity11 crashed in a superb second to deal what looks to be a fatal blow to @entity1 's already slim hopes of retaining their crown			1
the fading champions pulled one back through @entity18 but are now nine points adrift of leaders @entity20 , having slipped to fourth place			0
@entity6 striker @entity5 ( left ) celebrates after opening the scoring against @entity1 @entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity24 7 made two good saves of @entity27 efforts in the first half and marshalled his defence well			1
@entity29 6 has not been out of team all season , made his 100th appearance last night and was reliable as always			0
@entity10 6.5 @entity33 thinks he ’s up there with the best centre backs in the division			0
certainly underrated on the evidence of this game , he made a few vital interceptions and played part in the goal			2
@entity1 appealed for offside but @entity5 's first - half goal stood on monday night @entity44 6 picked up a booking for cutting down @entity46 but otherwise solid			1
@entity47 6 a lovely low ball into the penalty area in the second minute to almost set up a @entity6 goal if @entity51 could have converted			2
@entity52 6.5 put his body on the line to resist a @entity1 onslaught in the first half			2
@entity57 8 a superb , full hearted performance by the midfielder who made several vital clearances			1
@entity61 appeals to the officials as @entity5 celebrates after putting @entity6 ahead @entity63 6.5 should have put @entity6 ahead in the second minute but sliced shot high and wide of the target @entity65 6 might not be renowned for his defending but made an excellent first half tackle on @entity18 when the midfielder looked ominous @entity11 7.5 his curling free kick to double @entity6 ’s lead was superb , worked tirelessly and made an important first half tackle on @entity18			1
@entity5 8.5 against the run of play does not do justice to his 35th minute tap in but it was his fifth in as many games and he was a constant threat in the air , too			1
very lucky to get away with a blatant handball			0
subs @entity80 83 , @entity81 and @entity82 88 manager @entity84 8 is making @entity86 ’s decision to get rid of him seem even more ridiculous with every passing game			0
set up his side to defend deep and try do some damage on the counter attack			0
19 points from 10 games			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity18 ( right ) hammers home the equaliser @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity61 6 was tested just once in the opening half @entity97 6.5 right back 300th premier league appearance @entity100 6 seemed distracted by feelings of injustice after the @entity6 goal which he deemed to be offside @entity1 striker @entity46 could not find a way through a steadfast @entity6 defence @entity107 6 rightly booked for a hefty challenge on @entity5 @entity109 5.5 he and @entity97 struggled to deal with the pace of @entity111 and @entity51 and offered little in attack			1
@entity113 5 another game where too many of his passes routinely went astray and replaced by @entity117 before the @entity18 goal			0
will have to reassess his pre-match comment that @entity1 were still title contenders			0
@entity122 6 made a senseless and unnecessary challenge on @entity5 to give away the free kick which led to the second goal			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity122 failed to sparkle at @entity126 @entity18 7 was quiet in the opening half and twice prompted wolf whistles with his shots high into the stands at @entity126 but his goal was an absolute scorcher			2
@entity27 7.5 @entity1 ’s best man , hungry for the ball and characteristically intelligent passing			0
forced a couple of saves from @entity139 in the first half			0
@entity141 5 a quiet game for the striker who seemed furious at his manager at being replaced by @entity145 after 66 minutes but surely he could have no complaints ? the pressure is mounting on @entity1 manager @entity148 @entity46 6 expert at finding space in a crowded penalty box and hit the post in the first half , just could not find a way through a steadfast @entity6 defence			1
subs @entity145 66 - 5.5 , @entity117 and @entity156 88			0
manager @entity148 5 @entity159 ’s premier home removal firms might look to clear some space in their diary around the end of may because surely his time at the @entity164 is limited			1
referee @entity166 5.5 a mixed game for the youngest referee in the @entity169 ’s @entity3			0
he does not lack cojones , backing up his linesman who was probably right to rule @entity10 and @entity5 onside for the goal and dealt well with the excessive protestations of @entity1 players			1
but he missed an obvious @entity5 handball in the second half			2
@entity179 gives a thumbs up despite @entity1 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity6			2

@entity5 was man of the match and scored fifth goal in five games
midfielder @entity57 also put in a superb , full hearted performance
@entity148 's time is surely up after another *disappointing* defeat
