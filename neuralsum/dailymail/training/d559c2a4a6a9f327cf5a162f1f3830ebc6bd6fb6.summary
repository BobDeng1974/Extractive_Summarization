top lawmakers have agreed to a $ 1.1trillion spending bill - just two days before federal agencies were due to run out of money			1
the agreement , unveiled by the @entity6 - led @entity5 on tuesday night following days of backroom negotiations , would likely avoid a partial government shutdown			1
it would also fund most of the government through next september and delay a politically - charged struggle over president @entity13 's new immigration policy until the new year			1
' this bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government , preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy , cost jobs and hurt middle class families , ' said @entity24 sen. @entity23 , a @entity25 , and @entity27 rep. @entity26 , a @entity6 , in a joint statement			1

the spending bill will now go to the chamber 's rules committee to be prepared for debate and a @entity5 vote by thursday - the day the government technically runs out of money			1
despite grumbling from conservatives that it is too big , the @entity5 and @entity64 are expected to adopt the measure			2
there was no immediate reaction from the @entity5 to the bill			2
at 1,603 pages , the spending bill adheres to strict caps negotiated earlier between the @entity5 and deficit - conscious @entity6 , and is also salted with @entity6 policy proposals			1
president : the agreement would delay a politically - charged struggle over president @entity13 's ( pictured ) new immigration policy until the new year as described by unhappy liberals , one would roll back new regulations that prohibit banks from using federal deposit insurance to cover investments on some complex financial instruments			1

' the federal government 's going to run out of money in two days			1

speaker @entity105 said he hoped for a vote on the measure on thursday , and officials expressed confidence they could overcome opposition from tea party - backed @entity6 and avoid a government shutdown			1
@entity114 @entity113 issued a statement that said she was hopeful her rank and file could support the bill , but needed to review the final language			0
@entity64 approval would then be required to send it to @entity13 â€” one of the final acts of a two - year @entity124 far better known for gridlock than for accomplishment			2
not only a two - year @entity124 , but also a political era was drawing to a close as the lights burned late inside the @entity129 on a december night			0
for the first time in eight years , @entity6 will have a @entity64 majority in january after their hugely successful midterm election , and newly elected @entity6 senators - elect participated in closed - door strategy sessions during the day			0

proponents of campaign finance reforms decried a provision slipped in at the last minute that would sharply increase limits on the amount that an individual can contribute to various national political party accounts and committees each year from $ 32,400 to $ 324,000			0
that means individuals could give $ 648,000 per two - year campaign cycle , with a married couple capped at almost $ 1.3 million for an election cycle			2
the compromise spending bill will permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the sept. 30 end of the fiscal year , with the exception of the @entity177			2
funds for that one agency will run out again on feb. 27 , when republicans are expected to try and use the expiration as leverage to force @entity13 to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 4 million immigrants living in the country illegally			0
not all @entity6 agreed with the strategy of postponing a fight over immigration			0
some conservative lawmakers demanded a change deny the use of federal funds to carry out the president 's new policy			1
earlier in the day , @entity5 @entity6 removed one obstacle to passage of the spending measure by announcing they would pass legislation separately to renew a requirement for the federal government to assume some of the insurance risk in losses arising from terrorism			1
in talks with sen. @entity210 , @entity211 , republicans led by rep. @entity207 , @entity208 , agreed to the renewal , but said they wanted to roll back portions of the 2010 @entity215 law that tightened federal regulation on the financial sector			0

' we have a plan here that first and foremost works for the members of the unions , the workers in these companies and it works for the companies , ' said @entity229 , retiring at year 's end after four decades in @entity124			0

' also driving the talks was concern over the financial fate of the fund that insures multiemployer pensions at the government 's @entity261 the agency said in its most recent annual report that the fund 's deficit rose to $ 42.2 billion in the fiscal year ending sept , 30 , up from $ 8.3 billion the previous year , and that the likelihood of its bankruptcy is 90 percent by 2025			1
