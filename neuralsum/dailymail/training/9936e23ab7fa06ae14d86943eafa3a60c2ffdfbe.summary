battle : @entity9 wanted the book to be scrapped , but publishers printed it in a strongly - worded statement , he added : ' i will have to buy ' my autobiography ' in order to learn the extent of the errors and inaccuracies of the content of the book , but the damage is done			1
' in one excerpt , published today by @entity92 , the hacker gives his version of the background to the sexual assault allegations , claiming he met both women - named only as a and @entity97 - in @entity42 during the furore that surrounded his website 's leaking of sensitive @entity18 documents , before having consensual sex with them			2

the @entity3 - who admits he is ' some kind of weirdo ' with a reputation for ' workaholism and infrequent bathing ' - travelled the world carrying only ' a bag of socks and underwear , and a bigger bag of laptops and cables ' , and once had his hair cut as he worked at his computer			1

' this book was meant to be about my life 's struggle for justice through access to knowledge			0
it has turned into something else , ' he said			0

' i may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but i am no rapist , and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one			0

' he claims in the book that a contact in a @entity194 intelligence agency told him just before the rape allegations emerged that the @entity18 government was considering dealing with him ' illegally '			0

@entity9 does not confirm that @entity207 provided his organisation 's biggest revelations , saying @entity1 's ' deniability structures ' made it impossible for him to know whether he was the source			1
but he says the young @entity18 soldier would be ' a hero of democracy and justice who had taken a role in saving lives ' if he had supplied such information			0
@entity9 , 40 , who made headlines around the world with revelations from leaked @entity18 military files and diplomatic cable , also reveals how a contact in a @entity194 intelligence agency told him that the @entity18 government was considering dealing with him ' illegally '			2
