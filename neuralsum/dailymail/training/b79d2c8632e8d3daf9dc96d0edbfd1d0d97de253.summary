by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 17 december 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 has been branded the divorce capital of the world with judges free to award generous payments to former partners , a survey has shown			1
the flexibility given to judges presiding over divorce proceedings in @entity2 and @entity11 means spouses are more likely to receive generous maintenance payments than in 13 other countries , the research finds			1
the survey examined spousal maintenance payments in jurisdictions across @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
new research has revealed @entity2 is the divorce capital of the world when it comes to generous payments to ex-partners			1
in 2008 , @entity27 was awarded £ 23.4million following her divorce from sir @entity29 the study , by @entity31 law firm @entity30 , revealed a wide range of issues that judges can take into account when deciding on a settlement , set @entity2 and @entity11 apart from other jurisdictions			1
@entity40 's courts have long been earmarked as the divorce centre of the world following a raft of generous awards to ex-wives			2
generous settlements include that awarded to @entity27 following the break down of her marriage to sir @entity29 2008			0
following the four - year marriage , @entity50 received £ 24.3million			0
last month @entity52 was awarded a £ 20million sum after parting ways with her ' bankrupt ' husband @entity55			0
in 2006 @entity56 , the former wife of insurance magnate @entity57 was awarded a £ 48million settlement by the @entity2 courts in proceedings which took two years			2
mr @entity57 appealed the decision but the pay out , which made legal history at the time , was upheld in 2007			0
the businessman claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay his ex-wife anything , prompting a bitter dispute after she alleged he was worth millions			0
@entity69 , family law partner at @entity30 , said in other countries judges face more ridged rules dictating the affect the circumstances of the divorce has on a settlement , and the amount and duration of maintenance payments			1
@entity52 was awarded £ 20million last month following her divorce from ' bankrupt ' husband @entity55 she said while common themes were found in the ' most basic aspects of setting maintenance ' in some jurisdictions there are ' striking exceptions '			2
' and of course , it is these differences that favour certain jurisdictions , such as @entity2 and @entity11 , ahead of others in forum rates on divorce , ' ms @entity69 added			1
in all the areas studied , courts had the power to order maintenance payments on the breakdown of marriage , but in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , the length of time maintenance can be paid is strictly limited			0
most other jurisdictions give judges greater ' scope and independence in their decision - making ' but ms @entity69 adds ' @entity2 and @entity11 stands out for the broad judicial discretion it applies in considering all aspects of each and every case '			1
it is that freedom which ' frequently comes into play when deciding the quantum and duration of maintenance payments '			0
in @entity101 the courts use official guidelines , the @entity122 , when deciding on the size of payments to ex-partners			0
the formula provides a degree of certainty and predictability in calculating maintenance			0
the £ 48million settlement awarded to @entity56 , left , when she divorced her insurance magnate husband @entity57 , right , made legal history in 2006 meanwhile the @entity134 take a more informal approach			0
in many areas the concept of ' fault - based ' divorce allows factors including adultery , desertion and unreasonable conduct , to be used as a reason to refuse a claim for spousal maintenance			0
ms @entity69 added : ' @entity2 and @entity11 has an international reputation as an attractive divorce forum for the financially weaker spouse , and we should be proud of the courts ’ efforts to reach a fair result in each and every case			1
' however , the @entity154 is currently examining various issues in the family law arena , and changes to the law on the treatment of spousal needs , the definition of non-matrimonial property and the efficacy of prenuptial agreements are anticipated			1
t will be interesting to see whether future reform impacts on the extent to which the system in @entity2 and @entity11 is attractive to international couples			2
' the study looked at maintenance rules in @entity172 , @entity99 , @entity2 and @entity11 , @entity134 , @entity101 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity21 , @entity178 , @entity100 , @entity20 , @entity179 and @entity102 .			1

@entity2 and @entity11 are *deemed* divorce capital of the world
