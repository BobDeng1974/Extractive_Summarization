@entity2 - based @entity1 team @entity0 have officially stopped trading with the loss of over 200 jobs			1
@entity0 , absent from the @entity6 @entity5 and this week â€™s race in @entity8 , had hoped to take part at the season finale in @entity11			1
but their administrators @entity14 confirmed on friday that the financially - stricken team , whose headquarters are in @entity17 , @entity18 , will not race again			1
' @entity0 were placed in administration on october 27 and despite stringent efforts over the last few days to find a buyer and keep the team afloat , they have ultimately come to nothing			1
@entity28 added : ' whilst the team made significant progress during its relatively short period of operation , operating a @entity1 team requires significant ongoing investment			1
' the group was put into administration last month following a shortfall in on - going funding and the administration process provided a moratorium to allow for attempts to secure a long - term viable solution for the company within a very limited timeframe			2
@entity0 were placed in administration on october 27 and despite stringent efforts over the last few days to find a buyer and keep the team afloat , they have ultimately come to nothing ' sadly no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form			1
' we would like to thank all the staff for their support during this difficult process			0
' as joint administrators our immediate focus will be to assist staff who have lost their jobs and provide them with the necessary support to submit timely claims to the redundancy payments service			0
' the team will not be participating in the two further rounds of the 2014 championship in @entity83 and @entity11			1
the joint administrators will continue with their statutory duties to realise the assets of the business in the best interests of all the creditors			0
' @entity0 joined the grid under the guise of @entity91 in 2010 , funded primarily by @entity2 entrepreneur sir @entity92			2
they won the first points of their history at the @entity97 in may after @entity98 finished the race in ninth			0
but the team have since been rocked by the @entity103 's horror crash at @entity104 when he ploughed into the back of a tractor during the rain - lashed race			0
he remains in @entity109 hospital in a critical condition			0
after being taken over by @entity113 industry magnate @entity112 , @entity0 's own future was secured , but as it has proven only in the short term			2
with mounting debts and rising costs , @entity112 pulled the plug a fortnight ago after his home grand prix			0
and it now remains to be seen whether struggling @entity121 will follow suit as they , too , are currently in administration and fighting for survival .			0

more than 200 employees have been made redundant as @entity1 team folds
@entity0 placed in administration on october 27 and tried to find a buyer
but @entity30 confirmed on friday that the they had ' ceased trading '
team wo *n't* be present at final two races in @entity8 and @entity11
