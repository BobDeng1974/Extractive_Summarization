hundreds of ambulances specially designed to deal with obese patients weighing more than 50 stone have been rolled out across the @entity3			1

a quarter of @entity3 adults are obese			2
experts said spending up to £ 100,000 for specialist ambulances demonstrates the need for tougher measures to stop people becoming overweight			1
a reinforced , wider ambulance ( right ) , compared with a normal vehicle designed to carry extra-heavy patients ambulance services began introducing small numbers of specially equipped ' bariatric ' vehicles about four years ago to deal with the growing obesity epidemic			1
but figures obtained under the @entity31 revealed how there are now more than 800 ambulances in the @entity3 equipped to deal with obese patients			1
one trust , the @entity34 , recently trialled the new wider ambulances and over a period of eight months , were called upon 260 times			2
the most common call - outs were for falls or patients with blood poisoning			2
paramedics said it is also now common for them to treat patients housebound by their weight			1
@entity47 of the @entity34 , a council member of the @entity49 , said : ' a lot of the time we 're only finding patients when they reach crisis point because they have n't sought the routine checks and help they need out of embarrassment or simply because they can not get out of the house			0
' we have situations where two or three ambulances and a fire truck arrive in a street and we have to remove a window to get the patient out of their home and that attracts a lot of attention and can be just awful for that person			0
' it is really important to paramedics that they can treat patients , who are often collapsed or in an awkward situation , with dignity			1
having the right equipment and training is a big part of that			0
' we do n't want to be in a situation where we ca n't treat a patient because of their size - they deserve a good service , just like everybody else			0
' there are now more than 800 ambulances in the @entity3 equipped to deal with obese patients the new ambulances include wider doors and a stretcher for patients weighing 56 stone but @entity93 of the @entity94 said more should be done to tackle the obesity crisis			1
he told the @entity96 : ' there is no getting away from the fact that if you have these people , you have to cater for them and have extra-heavy ambulances			0
' but what we 're doing is spending a sack of money on treatment , when what we 've really got to be doing is stopping people getting fat in the first place			0
' the @entity111 said it operated 119 bariatric vehicles and aimed to upgrade its entire fleet by the end of 2017			0
it said this was a good use of funds as these vehicles could be used 24/7 whereas dedicated bariatric ambulances would sit idle until needed			0
@entity120 said that 295 vehicles — 98 per cent of its fleet — could deal with bariatric patients			2
