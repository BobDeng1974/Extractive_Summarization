by @entity0 @entity1 says light was incredibly bright , and bits of the world were ' missing ' earlier this year , the acclaimed @entity6 author @entity5 fulfilled his ambition of moving to @entity8 for the ' wonderful ' weather and outdoors lifestyle			1
he and his wife @entity11 quickly fell into a routine of coffee and almond croissants at a local cafe at 8am ; she 'd then go off to work ( as chief curator of the online gallery , @entity19 ) and he 'd go home to write			1
every other afternoon , he 'd cycle to the tennis courts at @entity23 as the sun set over the @entity25			1
two weeks after they 'd moved to @entity8 , @entity1 was getting ready to head out with @entity11 when he remembered he had to put out the rubbish			1
within seconds , he found himself in the middle of a medical emergency that might easily have cut this idyllic existence brutally short			1
' i bent down to put the rubbish in the bin , but when i stood up again , half the world - everything to the left - hand side of me - had disappeared			1
' initially , i thought i 'd lost the sight in my left eye , but i soon realised it was more complicated			1
i could see the frame of the mirror , but my face was n't reflected in it , as though i was a vampire			2
' @entity11 came out of the bedroom and i could see her up to chest level , but from there upwards she was missing ; no shoulders , no head			2
' although this was ' disorienting and disturbing ' , @entity1 was n't unduly worried			2
he was fit , slim and a non-smoker ; he 'd no reason to suspect anything serious			2
@entity11 called the hospital 's ophthalmology department and made an appointment for 9.30am			2
with an hour to wait , they decided to keep to their routine and go to the cafe first			2
@entity1 , however , found himself scrabbling around to gather his belongings			2
' i was incredibly confused , ' he recalls			2
' i kept saying “ where are my keys ? ” and @entity11 would tell me that i was holding them			2
' on the five - minute walk , i had to cling on to @entity11			2
the light was incredibly bright , and bits of the world were still “ missing ”			2
' at the hospital , an eye test established that the problem was not his eyes but his brain			1
' the doctor said the options were a migraine or a stroke - and as i 'd never had migraines , i feared it had to be a stroke			1
' a neurologist did tests , then sent him for an mri scan			2
within an hour , the neurologist delivered the bad news : @entity1 had had an ischaemic stroke - caused by a blood clot in the back of the right half of his brain			1
' my heart sank , ' says @entity1			2
' two hours earlier , the world had been fine			2
now i felt a series of trap doors was opening up beneath me			0
i thought : “ oh no , it 's my brain			1
my whole writing life comes from there			0
” ' @entity1 , 55 , is the author of 14 books , and in 2011 , his collection of essays , otherwise known as @entity103 , won @entity105 's @entity104			1
a neurologist did tests , then sent him for an mri scan			0
within an hour , they delivered the bad news in many ways , his stroke did n't make sense			1
he cycles six miles a day , plays tennis and table tennis , and his diet is healthy			0
' i hate all the food you 're meant to avoid , such as fried , fatty foods , but i do have a fondness for pastries			0
' he does n't smoke and drinks only moderately			0
nor was there any family history of strokes			0
' of all my contemporaries , i 'd have thought i was least at risk from a stroke , ' he says			1
strokes affect 150,000 a year in @entity130 , and are the third most common cause of death			0
' the majority of sufferers are over 75 , and it is linked to factors such as furred - up arteries and high blood pressure , ' explains dr @entity138 , consultant neurologist at the @entity139 in @entity140			1
' however , one - quarter of all sufferers are under 65			0
in younger patients , most strokes are caused by a clot which has formed in the heart or blood vessels and then travelled to the brain			1
' after his initial diagnosis , @entity1 stayed in hospital overnight for more tests			0
his eyesight was steadily improving , and by 9pm he ' could just about see to type '			0
his wife brought in his laptop and he began reading up about strokes			0
one of the things he learned was that strokes can often be preceded by mini strokes , or @entity160 ( transient ischaemic attacks ) , which can last anything from a few seconds to 24 hours			1
these are regarded as warnings that a major stroke is on the way			1
number of people who have a mini stroke and then have a full stroke within a year @entity1 now realised that he had suffered several of these episodes over the previous two years			1
' several times , but for less than a minute each time , my vision went all weirdly sparkly and was incredibly bright			0
' and once , in spring of last year , my thumb and index finger went totally numb for a few minutes			0
it was startling enough for me to comment on it to @entity11			0
but then it passed - and i forgot all about it			0
' in fact , anyone experiencing a sudden onset of neurological symptoms such as numbness or weakness in the limbs , drooping of facial muscles , speech problems or loss of vision , should be checked out immediately at @entity193 , says dr @entity138			0
he says national guidance now is that such patients should then be seen by a stroke specialist within a day if they are deemed to be at high risk of a further stroke , within seven days if they are low risk			1
this approach was introduced following a 2007 study by the @entity203 at @entity204 that ' sent shock waves ' through the specialism , said dr @entity138			0
' by seeing @entity160 patients immediately and with aggressive management with statins ( they asked patients to take the first dose in front of them ! ) , the medical researchers were able to prevent 80 per cent of strokes that would have happened when the patient would n't have seen a specialist for several weeks			0
' it 's also very cost - effective			0
you do n't have to prevent many strokes before you start to reduce the massive expense of disability			0
' by noon next day , @entity1 was relieved to find more of his left side vision had returned			0
the signs of a mini stroke or @entity160 ( trans ischaemic attack ) are similar to those of full - blown stroke but they tend to last just a few minutes			1
if you suspect you 've experienced one , it 's vital to be checked by a doctor as soon as possible			0
signs to watch out for are : ' the neurologist said they did n't know whether the blockage had cleared or whether the brain , with its great ability to re-route stuff , had just got round the blockage , but it all seemed pretty good			1
' he was discharged with low - dose aspirin to prevent another clot and a statin to be taken daily ( 20 mgs @entity246 ) for cholesterol - lowering as a precaution			1
' the next day , the neurologist rang to say my cholesterol results were through the roof , and the statin dose was doubled			0
' the precise cause of his stroke was never established but @entity1 was one of the lucky ones			1
while a third of stroke sufferers recover fully , one - third die and a third are left with a physical disability			1
' it was incredibly lucky to have had such a mild one , ' he says			0
after three months , his statin dose was halved as his cholesterol levels were down to a respectable 4.25			0
today , he has 98 per cent of his vision back			1
but @entity1 admits that it 's only recently that he 's stopped feeling vulnerable			0
' i worried that a bigger stroke might be on the way			1
' his stroke , he says , has highlighted ' how very precarious this thing of good health is '			1
@entity1 's latest book , @entity273 : life aboard the @entity275 , is published by @entity276 , £ 25 .			0
