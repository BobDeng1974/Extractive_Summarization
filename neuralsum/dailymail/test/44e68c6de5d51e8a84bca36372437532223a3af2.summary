it 's the fat - shaming / fit - shaming controversy that 's refusing to go away online fitness company @entity1 caused a @entity3 storm recently with its @entity5 poster of a genetically - blessed model in a small yellow bikini , asking : ' are you beach body ready ? ' the poster , promoting weight loss , came under fire from some feminists and body image campaigners who branded the campaign body - shaming and called for the offending images to be removed			1
@entity17 are in the process of removing the ad , and now internet pranksters have hit back with their own version of the poster , this time featuring three curvaceous women and featuring the caption : ' yes			1
we are beach body ready			0
we are beach body ready ' : an unknown internet source has recreated the controversial @entity1 ad , with curvy alternatives the original poster , from @entity1 , has been subject to much controversy , with many citing it as ' body - shaming ' the spoof advert follows the same striking format as the @entity1 original , with an eye - catching yellow background and bold font , and is marked up as a @entity43 product ( @entity43 's real beauty campaign encourages women to appreciate their bodies , regardless of size and shape ) but the brand have denied being involved			1
after being made aware of the copycat image a representative for @entity43 said : the ad was not created by @entity43 but we do believe that every woman is beach body ready ! @entity43 added : ' in 2004 , 75 % of women felt advertising and media set unrealistic standards of beauty			1
today , that figure is 66 % , with the perception being that more diversity is portrayed in the images of women we see around us			0
' we have clearly made some progress in the 11 years since @entity43 started @entity68 but there is still much to do			1
two thirds of @entity72 women would prefer to see more women of different weights and shapes , different ages and without digital enhancement in the media			2
this is why @entity43 will continue to champion beauty for everyone because looking and feeling your best makes you feel happier			1
' the image , which was posted on the @entity5 , is now being removed following complaints billboards such as this one , were defaced , as a result of anger from body image campaigners and bloggers it comes as plus - sized fashion label simply be also created its own poster			1

i love being able to show off my curves , so it 's great to see brands like simply be representing real women in the @entity72			2
' simply be spokesman @entity110 said that the controversial @entity1 advert was ' at best outdated , at worst insulting '			2
he said : ' while the @entity1 model , @entity114 , is undeniably beautiful and i 'm sure very healthy , it is irresponsible to project something that is largely unachievable as the ideal			0
' we need to make people feel great about themselves and this poster does the opposite			2
' because it so literally flew in the face of our ethos of self - acceptance , we wanted to get our message out further , hence taking ad space in one of @entity5 's busiest tube stations			2
' the original yellow billboard image received around 270 complaints to the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) , mostly insisting that it objectified women and that it carried the insinuation that only svelte models were ready to go to the beach			2
