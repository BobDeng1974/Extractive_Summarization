' i did n't feel any pain just shock			0
i could n't scream i was very frightened			0
my friends tried kicking it			0

' he had had the dog since it was eight weeks old and it was 14 - months - old when the incident happened			2
' he also told the court that the dog had never shown any aggression towards @entity27 's 16 nephews and nieces , who are aged between one and 16			1
he said : ' he has to concede the efforts he made to secure the garden were inadequate			0
' the dog having escaped , he did everything right after that			0
he pulled the dog off and made efforts to make sure it was secure			0

he asked them to take the dog away			0
his understanding is the dog was destroyed on that day			2
' after the case @entity27 , a van driver , said : ' i do want to apologise but the police say i should n't otherwise i could be accused of intimidation			2
' it was me who rang the police to get him put down			0
we heard screaming on the day but we thought it was kids playing , we heard it again and i ran out			2
' i jumped on the dog and told the rest of the kids to take him to his mum 's and ring an ambulance and then i shouted to my my aunt to ring the police and i wanted him put down			1
we did it that day			0
' we think @entity17 has gone for the ball			0
i 've got nieces and nephews one to 16 - years - old and we have never had any problems before			0
' he was a big dog , and did bark if you came near the house but he was playful too			0
we gave him bones from the butchers but never gave him them raw so it 's not as if they have had raw food			0
' we 're not belittling what has happened , we felt that everyone was thinking we did n't give a damn which we did			0
it 's a little kid at the end of the day and for that i 'm very sorry			1
