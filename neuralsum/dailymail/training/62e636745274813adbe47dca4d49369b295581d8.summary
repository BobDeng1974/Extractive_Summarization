trainer @entity0 says @entity1 has been showing ‘ electric ’ form in his home work as he attempts to win the @entity5 ’s @entity4 for the second year running			1
@entity6 was fourth to @entity8 ’s own in the two - mile @entity9 at the start of the month , his first run since finishing second to @entity12 , one of his rivals on saturday , in the @entity15 on @entity16			1
that effort from the 3 - 1 favourite , his first since recuperating from a pelvis injury , left some questioning his status going into the more suitable longer test			1
trainer @entity0 expects a strong run from @entity1 on saturday after recovering from pelvic injury but @entity24 , who combined with @entity26 to win the @entity27 with @entity28 , is in no doubt			1
‘ he had n’t run for 10 and a half months , ’ said the trainer			2
‘ we were giving away stacks of weight			2
@entity6 is positive , he said , “ would any of the three - mile chasers we are taking on have done any better in that race ? ” i doubt it			1
‘ it has sharpened him up brilliantly			2
i said after his very first race that no - one could hold him and he is a bit like that now			0
he has gone from coming up the gallops just off the bridle to electric			0
’ @entity26 , who also won the opener at @entity5 on @entity47 ’s @entity46 , added : ‘ i have been buzzing about this horse since @entity49			0
‘ some people questioned the form but i think it was a blinding run			0
i think you will see a great horse			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity55 will decide on saturday the punishment @entity58 winning trainer @entity57 must face after banned anabolic steroids were found at his @entity61 stable .			0
