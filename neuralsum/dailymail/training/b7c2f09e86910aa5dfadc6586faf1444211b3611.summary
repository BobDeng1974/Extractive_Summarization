two out of three @entity1 pilots were sleeping minutes before one shouted ' f * * * : we 're dead ! ' as their plane plunged into the sea with the loss of all 228 people on board			1
horrific details of the last moments of @entity10 , which claimed the lives of five @entity12 and three @entity13 , have emerged in a disturbing new investigation into the 2009 disaster involving an @entity16 330			1
published in the october edition of @entity20 magazine , it raises terrifying questions about safety aboard civilian passenger jets , and the ' culture ' of the @entity1 pilots on board			2
referring to @entity58 , a ' @entity59 ' on the @entity62 - @entity61 flight , the piece reads : ' with most of the weather still lying ahead and an anxious junior pilot at the controls , @entity63 decided it was time to get some sleep			1
' chief investigator @entity69 is quoted as saying : ' if the captain had stayed in position through the @entity73 , it would have delayed his sleep by no more than 15 minutes , and because of his experience , maybe the story would have ended differently			0
' but i do not believe it was fatigue that caused him to leave			0
it was more like customary behavior , part of the piloting culture within @entity1			2
' and his leaving was not against the rules			0
still , it is surprising			0
if you are responsible for the outcome , you do not go on vacation during the main event			0
' the @entity32 crashed after suffering a loss of lift - or a ' stall '			2
but instead of lowering the plane 's nose to deal with the stall , as they should have done according to normal procedures , the pilots raised it ( stock image ) victims : @entity30 doctors @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) were among the 228 victims on board the doomed flight @entity108 and @entity109 ( both pictured ) were the two @entity13 among the 228 victims who died in the plane briton @entity112 ( seen right at a weddnig ) was also killed when their plane went down shortly after taking off from @entity62 up until now it was known that @entity63 was sleeping off a night in @entity62 with his girlfriend , an off - duty hostess and opera singer who was on the doomed flight			1
' i did n't sleep enough last night			0
one hour - it 's not enough , ' said @entity63 , before he went to sleep			2
referring to ' the flight - rest compartment , a small cabin containing two berths just behind the cockpit ' , the piece describes how @entity128 was also ' dozing there '			0
the article continues : ' on the night of may 31 , 2009 , the pilots of @entity10 certainly did not serve their passengers well			1
' the plane was suffering from a loss of lift - or a ' stall ' - and its airspeed sensors had malfunctioned			0
but instead of lowering the plane 's nose to deal with the stall , as they should have done according to normal procedures , they raised it			1
@entity63 finally entered the cockpit 1 minute and 38 seconds after the pitot tubes malfunctioned , but by that time panic was setting in			0
anguish : relatives and friends arrive at @entity151 airport in @entity62 , @entity152 , 01 june 2009 , to receive information about the crash long search : it took two years to retrieve bodies from the bottom of the sea , along with essential records such as the flight 's voice recorder @entity128 said : ' f * * * , we 're going to crash ! it 's not true ! but what 's happening ? ' soon after , either @entity128 or @entity58 are heard to say : ' f * * * , we 're dead ' before - 4 hours and 15 minutes into the flight - it crashes into the @entity169			1
it took two years to retrieve bodies from the bottom of the sea , along with essential records such as the flight 's voice recorder			1
@entity1 has denied that its pilots were incompetent , but has since improved training , concentrating on how to fly a plane manually when there is a stall			1
both @entity1 and @entity16 are facing manslaughter charges , with a judicial investigation led by @entity61 judges under way .			0

@entity1 *447* crashed into @entity169 on may 31 2009 killing all *288* people
it took 2 years to find all the dead , who *included* 5 @entity12 and 2 @entity13
now , flight recorder reveals conversations of pilots moments before crash
they were captain @entity10 , 58 , and two junior *co-pilots* , 37 and 32
@entity63 had been up all night in @entity62 with his girlfriend , an opera singer
so when plane stalled inexperienced @entity10 , 32 , was at controls
but instead of lowering plane 's nose as per stall *protocol* , he lifted it
