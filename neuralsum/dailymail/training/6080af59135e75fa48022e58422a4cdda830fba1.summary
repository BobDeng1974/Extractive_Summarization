judge @entity2 raised his concerns about @entity4 after hearing the case of 17 - year - old @entity16 who bit off part of his friend 's ear ' it would have been appropriate if your brother could be in court today ' it was disgraceful , pathetic , juvenile behaviour - messages some of which were deeply offensive and of a violent nature			1
