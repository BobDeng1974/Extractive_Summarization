@entity1 secretary @entity0 told reporters on monday that there is ' absolutely no evidence ' that the @entity5 will lose jobs as a consequence of implementing the @entity8			1
but the nonpartisan @entity9 declared on february 4 that the @entity8 law would suck the equivalent of 2.5 million full - time jobs out of the @entity5 economy by 2024			1
' there is absolutely no evidence , and every economist will tell you this , that there is any job loss related to the @entity8 , ' @entity0 insisted monday in @entity20			0
@entity5 secretary of health and human services @entity0 continues to plug the @entity8 , claiming that it wo n't reduce employment the @entity1 chief and former @entity27 governor had at least 17 conversations with president and other @entity31 bigwigs leading up to the @entity8 system 's disastrous launch , it emerged last week ' part - time positions are actually down since 2010 , not up , ' she noted			1
' the number of full - time workers continues to increase			0
i know that ’s a popular myth that continues to be repeated but it just is not accurate			0
' but the @entity9 projected something dramatically different , concluding that so many @entity5 would stop working that the @entity5 workforce would shrink by millions			1
on february 10 vice president @entity42 seemed to agree with what @entity0 would say a week later , telling time that ' there is zero evidence that this is costing people jobs now			0
' the @entity31 immediately spun the @entity9 report as good news , saying that those ' choices ' reflected new flexibility for @entity5 who will soon be able to keep their health insurance without going to work every day			1
and @entity31 minority leader @entity53 claimed that ' it 's not going to cost jobs			2
it 's going to shift how people make a living and reach their aspirations			0
' ' this was one of the goals ' of the @entity8 , ' she added			0
@entity0 could have worded her statement differently , saying that @entity8 would n't drive employers to hire fewer people			2
but by choosing to say there would not be ' any job loss , ' she has left herself open to attacks from @entity71 members of @entity72 who are growing impatient with the @entity75 administration 's handling of the law 's implementation			0
the president has n't directly addressed the @entity9 report about @entity8 job losses , but his spokesmen have spun it as a positive when working @entity5 can make the ' choice ' to leave their employment the @entity31 has already announced 29 unilateral changes , many of which contradict the plain text of the @entity8			1
' this is going to drive @entity92 conservatives nuts , ' a @entity71 campaign operative in @entity89 told @entity93 on tuesday			1
' this year 's election is a referendum on @entity8 , ' he said			0
' it 's bad enough that the @entity31 is playing emperor in order to keep the law from a death spiral , but now the woman in charge does n't seem to understand how bad it 's going to be for the economy			2
' @entity1 did not respond to questions about how @entity0 ' statement could be reconciled with the facts the @entity9 has put on the record			0
but some in @entity72 had already piled on the notion that @entity8 will cost jobs			2
' just like when the president promised , ‘ " f you like your plan you can keep it , " those in the @entity113 who promised that @entity8 would n't negatively impact the job market could n't have been more wrong , ' @entity112 @entity71 senator @entity71 wrote in an essay for the @entity120 blog			2
and @entity122 chairman @entity121 said in a statement that the @entity31 seemed to believe ' that it ’s a good thing to discourage people from working			1

@entity127 insists @entity8 will not cost the economy jobs
the @entity9 wrote on feb. 4 that the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs will *disappear* from the economy by 2024 because of the health insurance law
the @entity31 spun that report as ' a good thing , ' saying @entity5 should be happy when they can keep medical insurance without working
' this is going to drive @entity92 conservatives nuts , ' a @entity71 campaign operative said
