by @entity0 for @entity1 at first glance , these portraits appear to be the work of a skilled photographer			1
and even upon a closer look , the extraordinarily detailed images seem too life - like to be anything but a high - definition picture			1
but the hyper - realistic works are in fact paintings , created in a @entity13 studio by a budding 23 - year - old artist			1
@entity15 describes his work as ' centred around high - realism ' in portraiture			1
more than 100 images are taken until he is satisfied with three working from his @entity13 studio , he takes between eight and 12 weeks to complete an oil portrait after photographing the subject			1
' i use oils primarily because of the way it interacts with light			0
this serves to give a greater sense of depth			0
' i like the solitary nature of painting			0
in a world saturated with technological stimulus it can be very redemptive to sit alone in silence painting for long stretches of time , ' he said			0
' the intricate nature of painting realism affords a kind of meditative state which can be deeply nourishing when going well ; the flip side of this of course is the low that comes from long periods of what you might call artistic block			2
' the process begins with the artist visiting a client at home or inviting them to his studio for photographs			1
he takes more than 100 until he is satisfied			2
' this stage usually takes around two hours			2
more than a hundred photos are taken until a set of three are chosen that i like			0
' this informs a series of tonal drawings that allow me to better judge which would best suit a painting			0
the painting process itself takes around 6 - 9 weeks			1
' towards the end of the portrait a further sitting of an hour will be performed to further compare my values against those of the painting			0
once the painting is complete it will be unveiled to the client			0
' this can either involve a private unveiling at my studio or the painting being sent to your address			0
' from inception to completion a portrait normally takes around 8 - 12 weeks to complete			1
' untitled 13 will be on display at @entity120 in @entity13 from september 25 , while @entity121 has been sold to a private collector for an unknown sum			1
the artist then works from tonal drawings to complete the portrait with oil paints			1
untitled 13 will be on display at the @entity120 in @entity13 from september 25 after photographing his subject , the artist takes more than 100 images back to his studio to begin work using a variety of brush - strokes and hues untitled 13 will be on public display next month while @entity121 was sold to a private collector for an unknown sum			1
portraits by the artist start at £ 3,400 and vary in size portraits by the artist start at £ 3,400 for 130cm x 90cm with larger canvasses ( 160cm x 110cm ) costing £ 5,000 , and are restricted to human subject matters			2
describing his technique , @entity15 says : ' i do not believe there is any dichotomy present in the idea that an almost perfect rendition of the human form can also be intensely expressive			0
' expression in painting - for me at least - comes from the deeply individual and selective nature the artist 's voice carries			2
' where i choose to apply paint thickly or turn form using a particular hue , are as intrinsic to the expressive nature of painting as the selection of a particular word is to a poet			0
' to extend the metaphor ; as in poetry , it is not the correct selection of words , as much as it is their ability to co-exist harmoniously with both a semblance of reality and the artist 's sentiments on the world - or in my case - the sitter present			2
