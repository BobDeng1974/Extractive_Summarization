the @entity3 chancellor yesterday announced she wants to encourage talks on whether the @entity15 should ‘ give something back ’ to member states this autumn			1
in a major boost for the prime minister , mrs @entity2 said : ‘ we do n’t have to do everything in @entity6			2
’ she signalled that she wants negotiations to begin after next month ’s @entity3 general election			0
mr @entity8 has said he will renegotiate the @entity25 ’s relationship with @entity6 before holding an in - out referendum in 2017			1
the @entity27 can reveal that mrs @entity2 has privately signalled to @entity28 that she wants to do a deal to help mr @entity8 to help him get what he wants so that @entity25 stays in the @entity15			1
senior sources say she has assured mr @entity8 of her support as long as he does not force her to ‘ choose between @entity25 and @entity33 ’			2
mrs @entity2 has opened a secret back channel to @entity36 mps who are working with the @entity37 to draw up a list of demands for the renegotiation			1
she sent an envoy from her @entity42 to talk to members of the 100 - strong @entity45 group of mps – and he promised to support the @entity25 as long as their proposals do not involve changing @entity15 treaties			1
@entity45 , which includes influential backbenchers @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity53 , has visited @entity54 and is planning further trips to @entity33 capitals to pave the way for renegotiation			0
a senior member said : ‘ @entity2 sent an envoy from her party to speak to @entity45			2
we were given the explicit message that she had seen what we were proposing and could support it			0
’ uphill struggle : @entity8 , pictured on a visit to @entity67 , wants to claw back powers from @entity6 before holding an in - out referendum a source in @entity54 said while they were not in favour of ‘ re-opening existing treaties ’ they were in favour of handing back power from @entity6 to national and regional government			1

‘ they also see @entity15 competitiveness as vital and recognise that it has made itself too cumbersome			0
’ among the ideas being proposed by @entity45 is an emergency brake on future @entity15 legislation that affects the @entity105 and a scaling back of the @entity15 ’s powers over employment and social legislation			2
sources suggest @entity25 could secure a partial or complete opt - out from the @entity112 as the price for supporting further harmonisation of the @entity116 economies .			0

talks could begin soon after @entity123 elections on *september* *22*
