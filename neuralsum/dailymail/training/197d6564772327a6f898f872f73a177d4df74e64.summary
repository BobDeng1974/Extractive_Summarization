@entity1 families may soon be using waterless toilets and recycling their urine , according to new research			1
chemical engineers at the @entity6 have been looking at ways to extract phosphorus - a life - sustaining element - from urine , before it enters the sewage system and becomes diluted			2
since estimates suggest that phosphorous - which occurs as phosphate rocks and is mined for crop fertilizer - could be exhausted in the next 50 to 100 years , urine recycling may be the key to conserving the non-renewable resource in the future			1
natural resource : scientists at the @entity6 say waterless toilets , which make it easier for life - sustaining element phosphorus to be extracted from urine - may be installed in @entity1 homes in the future @entity26 , an element we take into our bodies in the form of phosphates from foods like bran , cheese and nuts , is essential for human health , especially for bones and teeth			1
according to @entity40 , a phosphorus deficiency can lead to lost appetite , anemia , muscle pain , rickets and a weakened immune system			0
but with the extensive mining of phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer , it risks becoming scarce in the near future - an issue the scientists at the @entity6 sought to address in their research			1
under lab conditions , the researchers were able to successfully extract about 97per cent of the phosphates in urine within five minutes			2
they achieved the extraction with a scientific technique called ion - exchange using @entity61 resin , which may form the basis of systems to be installed in @entity1 homes in the future			0
@entity65 , chief executive of the @entity66 , said of the findings : ' our attitude and whole approach to recycling will need to change as we come under increasing pressure to conserve valuable , non-renewable resources like @entity26			1
' the research is another great example of chemical engineers providing alternative approaches and solutions to the creation of more sustainable approaches to issues like waste water management and recycling			0
' if urine - extracting toilets actually came into use , it would n't be the first time we have utilized our bodily functions in such a way			0
according to @entity94 , ancient cultures in @entity92 and @entity93 commonly used their own urine to provide nutrients to fertilize crops			0
and in parts of @entity101 , phosphate extraction from human urine is already underway			0
in 2002 , the tiny @entity103 town of @entity104 launched an initiative requiring homes to only have ' urine - separating ' toilets , to help combat the future global shortage of phosphorus .			2

@entity26 , which occurs naturally and is mined from phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer , may run out in the next 50 to 100 years
urine also contains a high level of phosphorus
introducing waterless toilets , so that phosphates may be more easily extracted from urine , may be the key to *saving* this non-renewable resource
