family members told @entity136 and the film 's researchers that @entity7 was well - educated and prosperous and that the family believed the doctor had used drugs to control her			2

' i wanted to get family members on both sides to tell their side of the story , ' @entity136 said			0

' in the black community , the @entity7 case was spoken of only in whispers , said @entity201 , a history professor at @entity202 who grew up in @entity11			2
' with @entity7 there was so much shame in the black community because of the sexual liaison , they really did not want to talk about it , ' @entity201 said			0

@entity136 hopes the documentary helps inspire funding for a feature film , which actor @entity220 has signed on to direct , should they get the money			0
