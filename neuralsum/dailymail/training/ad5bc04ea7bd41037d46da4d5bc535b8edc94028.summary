by @entity0 for many people diagnosed with cancer , losing their hair is one of their biggest fears and often one of the most upsetting parts of the illness			1
and for @entity10 , who lost her hair , eyebrows and eyelashes after chemotherapy , it was no less painful			1
diagnosed with breast cancer at just 29 and determined to stay positive , she decided to turn the experience into a project to track her hair growing back			1
she is pictured right just after she shaved her head and before her eyebrows fell out every day for the last 18 months , she has taken a photo of herself using an app to track her hair growth			1
beginning three months after chemotherapy finished , she went make - up free in each one to assess the progress of her eyelashes and eyebrows			1
now , two years to the week of her diagnosis , she has created a timelapse video of the pictures , charting her progression from looking like a ' baby chick ' to sporting a pixie crop			1
it is a far cry from the long , brown hair she used to have			2
but cancer , she says , ' forces you to get used to a new normal where image is secondary '			0
' that ’s not to say that my vanity has gone out the window , but it does mean i ’m delighted with my new pixie - do , even though i have a bald patch , ' she said			0
' as much as i envy women with beautiful , long hair , i ’m just grateful to have my health			2
' writing on her blog , she said : ' being bald has n't exactly been the best thing to ever happen to me , but it certainly is liberating			0
' you can take your wig off when you get too hot , you can have a totally different look every single day , and you save a fortune on shampoo and conditioner ( though it does n't quite offset the money doled out on expensive wigs ... )			2
every day for the last 18 months , she has taken a photo of herself using an app to track her hair growth ' the slight bald patch on the top of my head might never go away , but i 'm content with what i 've got			1
' miss @entity10 , a journalist , was diagnosed with cancer in june 2012 , a month before her 29th birthday			1
' i discovered the lump in february while on holiday in @entity76 and as soon as i got to @entity77 , i had a mammogram and ultrasound , ' she said			0
' doctors determined it was a fibroadenoma – a harmless lump with smooth edges that moves around			0
' they told me it was nothing to be concerned about , but i could get it double checked when i got home			0
' the lump was an inch big and felt like a small golf ball , but it never caused me any pain or discomfort			2
' but four months later , having moved to @entity91 , an ultrasound detected something unusual and she was sent for further tests , including another mammogram , ultrasound and biopsy , where a needle was inserted to take a tissue sample			0
days later she received the devastating news the lump was cancer			0
she said : ' as much as i envy women with beautiful , long hair , i ’m just grateful to have my health ' within a month , she had undergone life - saving surgery to completely remove the tumour from her left breast			1
but she still required six months of chemotherapy and two of radiation - with the first meaning she would lose her hair			1
' the truth is that losing your hair to chemotherapy is entirely different to shaving it off à la @entity122 popstar @entity121 , ' she said recently			1
some people having cancer treatment find that it does n’t affect their hair at all			1
but patients having chemotherapy often experience hair thinning or lose it completely			1
hair follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like cancer tumours , they are made up of rapidly growing cells			1
this is why chemotherapy can lead to hair loss , although it is almost temporary radiotherapy to the head always causes some hair loss			1
' for almost a year after my first chemo treatment , i had to get used to the double takes and pitying glances			2
' despite the occasional ignorant remark – like the man who shouted ' chemo ! ' at me while i was walking down the street – people were kind and reassuring about my baldness			0
' firstly , you have the emotionally painful experience of waiting for your hair to fall out			2
' secondly , it stops growing from below the root , so you end up with a polished egg look , rather than a stubbly rock chick one			0
' the worst thing , though , is losing your eyebrows – often the defining part of a face and the slowest thing to grow back			2
' a year after finishing chemo , mine are still a shadow of their former bushy , caterpillar - like selves			0
' but she says the fear of losing her hair again never leaves her - and she constantly touches her head to check it is still there			0
she admits she looks ' completely different ' to 18 months ago - but is unphased by it			0
' as much as i envy women with beautiful , long hair , i ’m just grateful to have my health			0
' my haircut is n’t a fashion statement or a choice			0
it ’s a side effect of the treatment that saved my life			0
