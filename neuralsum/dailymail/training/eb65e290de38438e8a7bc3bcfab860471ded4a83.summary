@entity1 striker @entity0 believes his side 's thrilling @entity3 win over @entity5 last month could have made all the difference in the bid to retain their domestic crown			1
since @entity11 's hat - trick sunk the @entity12 at the @entity13 , @entity1 have put a tough series of top - flight results behind them and earned emphatic away victories at @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity11 was on target twice more in the 4 - 1 win at the @entity22 on wednesday night and @entity0 says it is plain to see his side are playing with renewed confidence after pegging back leaders @entity28 to just six points			1
@entity0 unleashes his left - footed shot to put @entity1 in the lead at the @entity22 @entity0 told @entity1 's official website : ' honestly in the @entity3 we have not played well this season but the game against @entity5 helped us a lot			1
' now we are in a very good moment but we must continue like this because we are playing every three days and that can change , so we need to give 100 per cent in every game and be behind @entity28 and expect them to drop points			2
' we have more confidence because we had some bad times two or three weeks ago when we did n't play so well			0
' city boss @entity43 is hopeful captain @entity44 will be fit to return for next week 's crucial @entity3 clash with @entity46 after missing out on the trip to the north east with a hamstring injury			0
@entity0 points out his provider @entity11 after finishing off a slick build - up from @entity1 @entity44 is also definitely out of saturday 's clash with @entity54 and it was initially feared he could be sidelined for longer , but initial scans suggest the injury is not as bad as was first feared			1
meanwhile , @entity19 boss @entity58 has injury problems to add to issues of fatigue as he prepares his side for their third big game in a week at @entity65 at the weekend			0
@entity58 's men are clearly struggling after back - to - back clashes with @entity28 and @entity1 and @entity69 's substitution with an apparent back injury 55 minutes into the @entity22 clash will give cause for concern			1
but there could be better news on midfielder @entity76 who missed wednesday night 's game against his former club with a minor injury which should clear up for the trip to @entity81			0
@entity0 believes his side 's thrilling win over @entity5 last month could have made all the difference @entity58 said : ' @entity76 had a muscle problem at the end of the game ( against @entity28 ) and he was very close ( to playing ) but it was not enough			2
' @entity76 was replaced by another former @entity90 man , @entity89 , who admitted the @entity19 squad are feeling the strain of their hectic and high - profile fixture pile - up			2
@entity89 told his club 's official website : ' obviously it was a massive effort on saturday and a good point but it does take it out of you , and hopefully we can look ahead now and have a good performance against @entity65			0
' we do n't like to dwell on bad performances and results so we will look to get it out of our system as soon as possible			0
we need to find a bit of the performance against @entity28 and take it to @entity81 and do a bit better			0

@entity1 beat @entity5 3 - 2 at @entity13 in @entity110
since then they have comfortably beaten @entity18 and @entity19
city are second in the @entity115 , six points behind @entity28
