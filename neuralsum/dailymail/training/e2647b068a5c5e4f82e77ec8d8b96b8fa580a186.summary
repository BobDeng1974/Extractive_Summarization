activist hackers linked to the collective known as @entity3 have secretly accessed @entity5 government computers in multiple agencies and stolen sensitive information in a campaign that began almost a year ago , the @entity0 warned this week			1
the hackers exploited a flaw in @entity12 's software to launch a rash of electronic break - ins that began last december , then left ' back doors ' to return to many of the machines as recently as last month , the @entity0 said in a memo seen by @entity19			1
the memo , distributed on thursday , described the attacks as ' a widespread problem that should be addressed			0
' it said the breach affected the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and perhaps many more agencies			1
@entity5 government officials are ' very concerned ' about the amount of personal information the hackers obtained investigators are still gathering information on the scope of the cyber campaign , which the authorities believe is continuing			1
the @entity0 document tells system administrators what to look for to determine if their systems are compromised			0
an @entity0 spokeswoman declined to elaborate			0
according to an internal email from energy secretary @entity46 ' chief of staff , @entity45 , the stolen data included personal information on at least 104,000 employees , contractors , family members and others associated with the @entity26 , along with information on almost 2,0000 bank accounts			1
@entity54 ( left ) took an advantage of a security flaw in @entity58 software which is used to build sites the email , dated october 11 , said officials were ' very concerned ' that loss of the banking information could lead to thieving attempts			1
officials said the hacking was linked to the case of @entity54 , a @entity67 resident indicted on october 28 for allegedly hacking into computers at the @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity27 , the @entity69 and elsewhere			1
investigators believe the attacks began when @entity54 and others took advantage of a security flaw in @entity12 's @entity58 software , which is used to build websites			1

@entity3 has also launched technically more sophisticated attacks against @entity102 and security firm @entity103			0
some of the breaches and pilfered data in the latest campaign had previously been publicized by people who identify with @entity3 , as part of what the group dubbed ' @entity111			2
' among other things , the campaigners said the operation was in retaliation for overzealous prosecution of hackers , including the lengthy penalties sought for @entity119 , a well - known computer programmer and internet activist who killed himself before a trial over charges that he illegally downloaded academic journal articles from a digital library known as @entity88			2
despite the earlier disclosures , ' the majority of the intrusions have not yet been made publicly known , " the @entity0 wrote			0
' it is unknown exactly how many systems have been compromised , but it is a widespread problem that should be addressed			0
