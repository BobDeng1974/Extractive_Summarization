by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 18 november 2013 it opened in the @entity2 with a blaze of publicity , but within weeks it had been dubbed the art world 's ' @entity5 '			1
now @entity7 , a £ 72million black and pink themed gallery in @entity10 , is to close just five years after it opened			1
the reason is clear - @entity7 simply could n't attract the great @entity13 public			1
@entity7 in @entity10 has been consigned to history after it was closed by @entity15 as a result , @entity15 have had to pull the venue 's annual £ 1.6million subsidy			1
now the site will be transformed into a sixth form college			2
plans for the gallery had been hailed as one of @entity13 's largest and most ambitious cultural building projects , at the centrepiece of a £ 500million regeneration of the town			1
but when it opened in 2008 there was a storm of controversy			2
the project was more than £ 32million over budget , it opened three years late and in the weeks after it did open , it was beset by technical problems which prevented it from charging visitors			1
even the free concerts put on at the venue to bring people in attracted few visitors			2
one performance , by the soul singer @entity44 , drew an audience of just 17 people			0
originally planned to open in 2005 , @entity7 had problems from the beginning			1
six months into construction architect @entity50 went into receivership			0
the gallery had been hailed as one of @entity13 's largest and most ambitious cultural building projects , at the centrepiece of a £ 500million regeneration of the town @entity7 went way over budget and costs spiraled to £ 72million as it was built - then it was best by technical problems new architects were appointed but in 2006 the project was put into administration when the budget spiraled			1
after 18 months the administrators decided that the building should be finished and the project was transferred to the direct control of @entity15			1
on saturday , the venue finally attracted a bumper crowd as thousands of people turned out to say goodbye to the ' @entity5 '			0
@entity72 , a 46 - year - old nurse from @entity73 , told the @entity74 : ' it is absolutely devastating			0
in my view @entity7 is one of the best things to have happened to @entity10			1
' i have come to see a lot of events and shows and they have all been fantastic			0
it has also been a great place to bring children to learn new things			0
' i think it a very sad day for the town			0
' @entity88 , a 47 - year - old artist from @entity89 , @entity90 , said she had exhibited works at the venue and was ' gutted ’ to see it go			0
' the decision to close @entity7 now makes no sense			1
with the completion of @entity98 this is the time the venue is most needed			0
instead it is being shut			0
' i ca n’t help but think if a building like this had been in another area , such as @entity106 , it would have been saved but because it is in @entity10 it is n’t			2
' @entity110 mayor @entity109 said : ' i was here at the opening when many were very much against even the idea of an arts centre in @entity110 and branded it complete nonsense			2
' now we are here to celebrate its life and mourn its passing as many are now so very much for the idea of an arts centre in @entity110			0
' we have gone full circle in a very short time			0
' @entity15 leader @entity123 said : ' i 've been charged by the people of @entity110 to protect front - line services , and that is what i am trying to do			1
' it 's a difficult decision , i 'm sorry that we 're having to make this decision , and i do appreciate why some people are upset			2

@entity7 was meant to cost £ *40m* , but costs spiraled to £ 72m
@entity15 have had to subsidise it to the tune of £ 1.6m annually
gallery was hailed as one of @entity13 's most ambitious cultural building projects
but its opening was beset by technical difficulties right from the start
