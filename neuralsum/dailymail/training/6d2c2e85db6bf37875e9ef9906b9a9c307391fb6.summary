a @entity1 government lawyer has reportedly conceded that tens of thousands of long - missing emails belonging to former @entity4 official @entity3 – messages the @entity7 administration has claimed were lost in a 2011 computer crash – were safely backed up along with the computer records of every other federal employee , claims conservative group @entity11			1
the documents are key to a congressional investigation into a political targeting scheme @entity3 allegedly masterminded , which involved singling out conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive scrutiny – based on words in their names like ' tea party ' or ' patriots ' – when they applied for tax - exempt charitable status			1
@entity11 president @entity22 , whose group is suing the @entity4 over its failure to provide the records to @entity26 , said monday that the revelation came on friday from an attorney who works in attorney general @entity30 's @entity29			1
' all the focus on missing hard drives has been a diversion , ' he said			0
' the @entity7 administration has known all along where the email records could be – but dishonestly withheld this information			0
you can bet we are going to ask the court for immediate assistance in cutting through this massive obstruction of justice			0
' @entity22 said during a monday afternoon @entity58 broadcast , ' that it turns out the federal government backs up all computer records in case something terrible happens in @entity64 and there is a catastrophe , so the government can continue operating			2
' the catch , he added , is that the @entity29 attorney also claimed ' it would be too hard to go and get @entity3 's emails from that backup system			1
' the @entity29 is representing the federal government in the lawsuit			2
' so everything we 've been hearing about scratched hard drives , about missing emails of @entity3 , [ and ] other @entity4 officials , other officials in the @entity7 administration , ' @entity22 told @entity58 , ' it 's all been a pack of malarkey			1
' ' they could get these records , but they do n't want to			0
and they have n't told anyone about it , frankly , until we were able to get it out of them on friday			0
' ' and there 's no such thing as @entity3 's missing e-mails , ' he insisted			2
' it 's all been a big lie			0
they 've been lying to the courts , to the @entity1 people and to @entity26			0
' @entity4 commissioner @entity102 and @entity104 press secretary @entity103 have been particularly insistent that @entity3 's emails were gone forever			1
@entity102 told a congressional panel on june 20 that @entity3 's hard drive ' was recycled then destroyed ' because ' it was determined that it was dysfunctional and that , with experts , no emails could be retrieved			1
' hours later during a @entity104 briefing , @entity103 was asked why two years of @entity3 's emails were missing			1
' well , because there was – the computer crashed , ' he responded			0
' and what we 've seen is a demonstrated effort by this administration and by the @entity4 to try to cooperate with legitimate questions that have been posed by [ @entity26 ] on this			0
' the @entity119 is running a parallel investigation into whether @entity3 or anyone else in the @entity122 broke federal laws by targeting conservative groups for political retribution , or by covering it up when @entity26 began to subpoena records from the administration			1
@entity129 , co-founder of @entity130 , one of the groups the @entity4 hamstrung for years , said monday that the latest revelations are ' part of a continuing pattern of dishonesty and thuggery we 've seen from this administration			2
' ' when the government launches intimidation campaigns against private citizens simply because they may not agree with the government – and then lies about evidence being " lost " – it should outrage all @entity1			0
' @entity4 commissioner @entity102 has appeared in several @entity147 - dominated congressional hearings , insisting that @entity3 's emails are gone for good and her faulty hard drive was ' recycled ' ' everything we 've been hearing about scratched hard drives , about missing emails ... it 's all been a pack of malarkey , ' @entity22 said monday federal judge @entity157 demanded two weeks ago that @entity4 officials sign sworn statements describing efforts that were made to recover the @entity3 emails			1
none of the affidavits sent to his court so far has mentioned anything about an all - encompassing backup system where the records might still be awaiting discovery			0
' we want to know why they had n't told the court about this backup system , ' @entity22 said monday on @entity58			2
' if this backup system is working , @entity3 's emails are there			1
there are half a dozen other @entity4 officials whose emails have supposedly disappeared as well			0
and we 've heard from other agencies , like over in the @entity180 over @entity181 , emails disappearing there			0
' ' we 've been led to believe that once they disappear they ca n't be found again , ' he said , ' when in fact they back up everything , as most people suspected [ and ] now the government has confirmed			0
' @entity22 's group plans to ask judge @entity157 to rule that the @entity7 administration has gone out of its way to avoid turning over documents that it knew were readily available			2
if the @entity4 has been withholding evidence from the courts , it 's also been withholding it from @entity26			0
what about the backups ? @entity104 spokesman @entity103 said on june 20 that @entity3 's computer ' crashed ' and claimed the @entity7 administration had tried to ' cooperate with legitimate questions ' ' @entity11 will press its concerns on monday , august 25 , before @entity1 magistrate judge @entity205 , ' @entity22 said late monday in a statement			1
@entity157 has appointed @entity205 , an expert in the courtroom ' discovery ' of electronic records , to manage the back - and - forth between the administration and @entity22 's attorneys about missing records			2
some of that wrangling concerns exactly what happened after @entity3 reported that her hard drive had malfunctioned			2
an @entity4 information technology official wrote friday in a sworn statement that while tech experts allegedly sent the device for testing and data recovery , no one thought to examine her government - issued @entity223 to see if copies of her emails could be saved			1
there is ' no record of any attempt by any @entity4 it employee to recover data from any @entity223 device assigned to @entity3 in response to the congressional investigations or this litigation , ' the it expert , @entity227 , wrote .			1

a conservative group suing the @entity4 for a former official 's emails tied to a political targeting scandal says the @entity29 now concedes the records exist
@entity11 's lawsuit *initially* led the federal government to claim a hard - disk ' crash ' destroyed tens of thousands of @entity3 's emails forever
@entity3 led the @entity4 *department* *accused* of singling out right - wing groups for intrusive scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status
' they could get these records but they do n't want to , ' said @entity11 president @entity22
new court records also show that after @entity3 's hard drive crashed , the @entity4 never tried to recover data from her government - issued @entity223
this first *paragraph* *ofthis* article has been *updated* to further *clarify* that the claims made by the @entity1 government lawyer relating to the missing emails come from conservative group @entity11 .
