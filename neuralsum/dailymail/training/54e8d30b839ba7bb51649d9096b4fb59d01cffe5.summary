nowadays , more than half of children in the @entity2 are born out of wedlock , but five decades ago the outlook for an unmarried mother was bleak			1
this is the reason that @entity7 was given by her parents in 1965 , when they forced her to choose between her boyfriend @entity9 and her unborn child , who they named @entity12			1
after discovering that their child was pregnant at the age of 18 , her mother and father gave her an ultimatum – keep your baby or leave your boyfriend			2
@entity7 made the heart - breaking decision to put her baby up for adoption and she and @entity9 ended up marrying and having six more children together , but they never stopped thinking about their firstborn			1
@entity7 , 68 , from @entity29 , ( ( left ) was forced to choose between her baby and boyfriend @entity9			1
she picked @entity9 ( right ) and the couple married and had six more children together , but spent years searching for their firstborn			1
fifty years on , they have been reunited with their son , who is now called @entity36 ( centre ) now , 50 years later , the couple have been reunited with their son - who is now called @entity39 - and the three adults are finally learning how to be a family			1
@entity7 has now revealed that until she reconnected with @entity36 , she always felt like a piece of her was missing			1
the 68 - year - old from @entity29 , south @entity44 , was given no choice but to give up her child by her parents , and tried for years to find him after being made to give him away to a couple in @entity49 , @entity50			0
she was sent to a mother and baby home in her last trimester and after he was born , was given just five weeks with him before her mother picked her up and drove her to @entity49 to hand the child over			2
@entity7 told @entity58 : ‘ every time i was pregnant it brought it all back			2
i 'd wonder what @entity12 was like , what he was doing			0
‘ i think they thought i 'd forget , but you do n't forget a baby			0
’ @entity36 as a baby after he was given up for adoption @entity7 and @entity9 first met aged 14 and starting dating four years later			1
when , just a few months into their relationship , @entity7 discovered she had fallen pregnant , her parents were outraged and locked her in her room			2
@entity7 and @entity9 on their wedding day in 1966 they gave her an ultimatum of her baby or @entity9 after deciding that the young couple would n’t be able to give their child a decent start in life with the minimal salaries they earned as a tv electrician and an audio typist			1
after picking @entity9 , @entity7 was forced to return to work , where her colleagues often questioned her about her unborn child – the due date and the baby ’s father			1
although @entity9 and @entity7 both desperately wanted to keep their baby , a @entity2 law at the time which has since been changed , forbade anyone under the age of 21 from getting married without their parents ’ permission			1
but to prevent her from being the subject of unkind gossip as an unmarried pregnant woman , @entity9 bought his girlfriend a fake engagement ring and wedding band			2
she said : ‘ if you walked around with a bump and did n't have a ring on people would stare			0
’ after giving birth , @entity7 moved back home and tried to continue her life , requesting a transfer at work so that she would n’t have to face any questions from colleagues about how her baby was getting along			2
a year later , @entity7 and @entity9 were married and went on to have four other sons - @entity115 , 45 , @entity116 , 43 , twins , @entity117 and @entity118 , 32 - and two daughters , @entity120 , 36 , and @entity121 , 34			1
but they always wondered what became of their first child			0
after a few years , @entity7 started trying to find her son , but as she was never given the birth certificate , she had no leads to start with			2
@entity36 as a boy @entity36 's adoptive parents , who he says gave him a wonderful childhood desperate , she joined a missing person ’s website and posted every detail she could remember about her child from the few weeks she ’d had with him			0
then three years ago , the couple discovered that a change in the law meant she could apply for @entity12 ’s birth certificate and she set about finding him , posting a new message every year on his birthday			0
with the help of her local council , she tracked down @entity12 , who was now called @entity39 , to a three - bedroom terraced house in @entity149 , @entity150			0
@entity36 , who is a married accountant with three children of his own , @entity152 , 23 , @entity153 , 13 , and @entity154 , 11 , was amazed to receive a letter from his birth parents			1
after being given a happy childhood by his adoptive parents – a housewife and engineer – he was reluctant to get in touch with his birth family in case it upset him			0
@entity7 and @entity164 with their son @entity36 who they gave up for adoption now reunited at their home in @entity44			1

there were a few tears			0
