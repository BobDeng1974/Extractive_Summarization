they were @entity15 , who became @entity16 , @entity17 , the @entity18 and @entity19 , the @entity20 seven identical documents were signed by the brothers at @entity31 and for each one a layer of pink blotting paper was placed over the top to dry the fountain pen ink			1
there would have been seven pieces of blotting paper but only one has survived and that was kept by @entity8 who later gave it to a foreign diplomat as a memento			1
the pink slip of paper has been looked after and handed down through the anonymous diplomat 's family			2

' it is from the time when @entity8 sat down at a desk in the drawing room of @entity31 with his brothers to sign the @entity10			2
' it was the first time in modern history a monarch had abdicated and there were n't any procedures for it to go by			0
' i imagine lawyers and consitutional experts recommended that all four brothers signed the document			0
' the blotting paper was quite thick because it was absorbent			1
it would have been placed over the signed document to dry the ink and make sure it did n't smudge			0
' in his memoirs , called a @entity107 that was published in 1951 , @entity8 wrote : ' by breakfast the next morning the official copies of the @entity10 , locked up in my familiar red despatch box , were already on my desk			2
' my three brothers arrived ... we assembled immediately in the octagonal drawing room			0
' sitting at the desk with my three brothers watching , i began to sign the documents			0
it was all quite informal			0
the room was filled with a dignified dull murmur			0
' when i had signed the last document i yielded the chair to my brothers who in turn appended their signatures as witnesses in their order of precedence			2
' dr @entity78 said the seven copies of the @entity10 are held in the @entity129 but this is the only sheet of blotting paper known to exist			1
he said : ' @entity8 kept the blotting paper as a memento and shortly afterwards gave it to a friend and it has been in their family ever since			1
