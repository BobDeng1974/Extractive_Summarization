by @entity0 published : 00:30 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 07:27 est , 23 january 2014 can you remember what you were doing this time yesterday ? perhaps not , but scientists have proved what @entity6 was doing at 4.53pm on february 5 , 1883			1
the great @entity9 impressionist was standing on a rocky beach in @entity11 , looking at the sunset			1
a five - strong team of astronomers looked at the painting @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and used the position of the dark red setting sun to work out exactly when @entity6 took his inspiration			1
an exact science : a team of astronomers has decided @entity6 took the inspiration for this painting at 4.53pm on february 5 , 1883			1
they studied the position of the setting sun compared to the needle of rock hard work : the team from @entity34 , including professor @entity35 , right , used postcard - sized copies of @entity6 's paintings to work out where on the @entity11 beach he was standing art - lovers : from left , researchers @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 travelled to @entity9 the work was one of three painted by @entity6 during a three - week stay in 1883 , but the only one containing the disc of the sun. physics professor @entity35 , from @entity34 , said this was the crucial detail which allowed his five - strong team to date the work			1
he said : ' the canvas shows the orange disk of the @entity59 sinking toward the horizon near a spectacular line of cliffs			0
' we like to use astronomy to show students how science can solve real - world puzzles			0
' we asked , " could we use the dramatic rocks in the landscape and the position of the setting sun to determine where and when , specifically , @entity6 created this beautiful masterpiece ? " ' to start with , the researchers paced up and down the @entity9 beach to decide where @entity6 had stood when he took in the view			1
a fine art : the unusual rock formations meant the scientists could work out where @entity6 had stood			1
in this photo , they worked out the exact location of the painting known as @entity86 iconic : this painting , @entity88 , took in the famous @entity88 stone arch in the cliffs they had been told where the artist was said to have stood , but they quickly realised art historians had got it wrong			1
instead , using postcard - sized copies of his paintings for reference , they figured out @entity6 had been standing 425 yards away on a rocky beach under an overhanging cliff			0
then they had to work out the date and time			0
they knew @entity6 had visited the area in winter 1883 , so they used planetarium software to compare the modern sky to that of the @entity113			0
with the crescent moon for reference , they discovered the sun must have set along the path depicted in the painting on february 5			1
just to be sure , they checked two days on either side by combing through the artist 's letters			1
on february 3 he was working on a different beach ; on february 4 he was entertaining his brother ; on february 6 the tides did not match the painting and on february 7 it was raining			2
natural beauty : @entity6 was inspired by the cliffs and later returned to paint them in this work from 1886 seen by many as the greatest impressionist , @entity6 showed his world in rough , wild brush strokes lastly , the researchers worked out what time the work was painted			2
they compared sunset charts to the needle - like @entity141 rock , calculating exactly when the sun would have passed the formation			2
mr @entity35 added : ' we were going out there at low water - it 's just safer that way			0
' @entity149 , [ one of the researchers ] , is accustomed to difficult hiking terrain , and she said that the beaches near @entity153 had the most difficult footing she 'd ever been on in her life			0
' and as you get farther out , it gets worse , because it ’s slippery , with the rocks covered with seaweed that ’s still wet from the previous high tide			2
' @entity6 went out there with all of his painting equipment			2
walking in @entity6 's footsteps : the team stand on the same spot where he took his inspiration ' we were able to determine the month , day , hour and precise minute , accurate to plus or minus one minute , when @entity6 was inspired by that beautiful scene			0
' @entity6 observed this sunset on february 5 , 1883 at 4.53pm local mean time			0
' the extraordinary discovery was made possible because the sun follows a slightly different path on each day of the year , because of the changing seasons			2
in winter it follows a short , shallow arc across the sky but in summer it rises further to the east , lifts higher in the sky and sets further to the west			0
the findings have been published in the latest issue of @entity187 by mr @entity35 , a veteran of ' forensic astronomy ' who has studied works by @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 .			0

the @entity195 , @entity17 , @entity18 was painted during a trip to @entity11 , @entity9
scientists *focused* on the position of the setting sun in the painting
they calculated where he stood and where the sun would have been
@entity34 also combed through letters and tide *tables*
