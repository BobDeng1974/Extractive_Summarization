by @entity0 for @entity1 a motorcyclist who filmed himself careering off ' @entity4 's most dangerous road ' at 60mph has been found guilty of dangerous driving after police spotted the video on @entity9			1
the shocking footage shows then 21 - year - old @entity11 flying off his bike and down a 40ft ridge as he swerved to avoid a car on the notorious @entity15 in @entity16			1
somehow @entity11 escaped with only minor injuries , despite the clip showing him repeatedly somersaulting down a hill			1
it has repeatedly been branded @entity4 's most dangerous due to its sharp bends and steep drops - between 2007 and 2011 there were 44 fatal or serious accidents on the road			1
@entity11 posted the video of his crash on @entity9 in order to ' warn other riders ' about the dangers of the road , but it became such a hit that it drew the attention of police , who decided to prosecute			1
the video has racked up more than 100,000 views , and shows @entity11 overtaking two bikes before veering into the wrong lane and coming within inches of colliding with a car on a corner			1
he then flies off into a field and is thrown from his 600cc @entity57 , with the whole incident filmed by a camera on his helmet			1
steep fall : after avoiding the car , @entity11 heads down the hill and somersaults repeatedly the dazed @entity11 is then seen getting to his feet , dusting himself down and clambering back up the hill to greet concerned onlookers who had stopped to help			1
his only wound was a cut hand - which he received when he grabbed hold of some barbed wire as he walked away from the crash			2
@entity11 , an engineer from @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ' i ca n't believe i walked out of that , not even with a broken bone			1
' when i went over the ridge i was like helicopter spinning			2
i thought , this is it			0
my bike stayed at the top of the ridge and i continued down			2
high - speed racing : the cat and fiddle road is notorious for motorbike racing and is @entity4 's most dangerous warning shot : @entity11 shared the video as a warning to other bikers , but his plan has now backfired ' if my bike had followed me and crushed me , i would not be standing here today			1
' @entity11 was found guilty at a hearing at @entity93 and will be sentenced later this month			1
he has been banned from driving any vehicle in the meantime			2
the bike , which stopped at the top of the ridge , was written off and has been sold for parts			2
because of its winding nature , the @entity15 draws a large racing crowd , and is particularly popular with motorcyclists			0
in the 12 @entity105 charity reports since 2002 , it has been come top of the list of most dangerous roads in eight			2
at 1,680ft it is also one of the highest roads in @entity112			0
