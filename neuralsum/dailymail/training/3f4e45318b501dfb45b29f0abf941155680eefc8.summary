' it 's still there to fuel to me - the way it happened			1
they blew us away in the end			0
' i learned from that game , that it 's not about trying to win the game early			0
' it 's a general big - time test match where you try and win as many moments as you can			2
' it was a lot better in the second game and we showed them a lot more respect			0
' everyone thought " oh @entity69 no " when @entity6 went ahead but we had to trust our plan and we got the win which was really good			2

it 's refreshing to see because it 's an exciting brand of rugby			0
