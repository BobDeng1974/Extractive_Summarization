' i ca n't really remember much of it , but i remember @entity19 saying " the baby 's coming "			0
help from my friends : @entity10 ( pictured with baby @entity16 with from left @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 ) started to feel a few stomach cramps at the party but dismissed it as nothing important as she wasnt due for another two weeks ' i was shocked at how quick it all was - it was all very surreal			1

happy parents : @entity22 ( @entity73 ) teamed up with her friends to organise her special day to welcome the baby at their home but did n't expect little @entity16 to make an appearance but when she had disappeared upstairs for a long time , her friends went to check everything was alright			1

' then @entity16 was born at 4.10pm			1
surprise : @entity22 and @entity10 had decided not to find out what sex their baby was , as they wanted it to be a surprise , which it certainly was ' we 'd called 999 but the baby was born before the first responder arrived			1
it was all so quick			0

@entity18 , 33 , who lives in @entity113 and works as a sales manager for a cider company , said : ' i was on the phone to the 999 woman and repeating everything she told me - she was fantastic			0
' then @entity16 came - it was quite unbelievable ' " it was one of the best moments of my life , but a bit frightening at the same time			2
' when the first responder arrived a few minutes later , @entity16 was snuggled up on her mum 's chest , surrounded by her family			2
@entity10 's mum was then invited to cut the umbilical cord			2
mother and baby were taken by ambulance to the women and @entity135 at @entity136 , where they stayed until monday afternoon			0
