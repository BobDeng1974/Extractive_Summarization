a pair of three - month - old baby gorillas have made their debut at the @entity3 after being delivered just 48 hours apart back in january			1
the @entity4 have been spotted roaming around the zoo 's @entity6 exhibit with their mothers @entity9 and @entity10 , who are both 16 years old			1
pictured riding around on their mother 's backs , or cuddling up in their arms , the duo have been welcomed by the other 17 gorillas in the enclosure , including @entity18 , 32 , who is father to them both			1
but that has not stopped them from winning over crowds at the zoo as they explore their new home			0
because of their young age , they are not always on display for visitors , with appearances depending on conditions such as temperature and weather			0
the eldest of the pair was delivered on january 17 this year , while the younger arrived just 48 hours later , much to the excitement of animal keepers			1
while they weighed just 4lb at birth , they will eventually grow to weigh more than 400lb as adults			0
the new babies are joined by two other youngsters who were born earlier in 2014			2
fitting in : the two new youngsters join another pair of gorillas that were born earlier in 2014 , along with 13 adults in the zoo 's @entity6 exhibit having a cuddle : while the babies have different mothers , they share a father , 32 - year - old @entity18 who was nowhere to be seen in these pictures the western lowland gorilla is an endangered species in the wild , but while exact numbers are not known because of their remote habitats , they are believed to be more common than mountain gorillas			1
lowland gorillas can be distinguished by their slightly brown coat and long arms , and usually live in communities of around 30			2
the group will be lead by one dominant male , the alpha , sometimes called the silverback because of the shock of silver hair which usually covers his shoulders			0
thanks largely to disease and destruction of habitat , the numbers of @entity85 gorillas living in the wild have dropped by 60 per cent in the last 20 to 25 years , making zoo conservation efforts all the more vital			0
surviving : while the @entity93 is thought to be among the most common gorillas in the wild , they are still an endangered species , making programs like this important to ensure their survival			0
