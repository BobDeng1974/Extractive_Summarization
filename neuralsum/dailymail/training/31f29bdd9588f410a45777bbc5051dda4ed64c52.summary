@entity1 's display against @entity2 was so bad , according to @entity4 newspaper as , that they refused to even give him a rating for his performance			1
there was n't an @entity10 player out there who particularly shone on a fairly harrowing night for @entity10 , but it was @entity1 's unfortunate role in both of @entity15 's goals that probably led to him receiving such harsh marks			1
the captain was beaten to the ball all too easily in midfield before @entity2 swarmed forward for the first , and got underneath a header from a long ball , from which @entity15 pounced upon for the winner			2
goalscorer @entity40 , @entity41 and fullbacks @entity42 and @entity44 all managed to must a two			0
and , unsurprisingly , the superb @entity15 who was only the man given full marks on the night			0
critical : @entity49 sports paper @entity47 were equally scathing of @entity1 's performance , awarded him a 3/10 over in @entity49 , meanwhile , sports paper @entity47 were equally scathing of @entity1 's performance - awarding him just a 3/10			1
@entity35 was also given the same low mark , with only @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity40 given more than a five			0
@entity2 , naturally , fared a lot better , with captain @entity56 their only man venturing below halfway in the ratings .			0

@entity1 's display so bad that @entity4 paper as refused to give him rating
@entity49 sports paper @entity47 also only award him 3/10 for his display
2 - 1 defeat to @entity2 puts @entity10 on the verge of @entity70 exit
@entity15 scores twice with @entity1 playing role in both goals *conceded*
