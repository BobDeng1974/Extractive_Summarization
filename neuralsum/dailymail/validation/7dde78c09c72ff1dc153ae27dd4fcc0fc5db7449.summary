a young boy was in need of a fix that only his local pub could provide			0
filmed at home in @entity8 , the 20 - month - old boy named @entity5 stands in front of his mother with tears streaming down his cheeks			1
he urges her and his father to take him to the local pub - where he usually receives sweets and hot chocolate - instead of the doctor 's surgery			1
the youngster stands in front of his mother crying , clearly disappointed about having to see the doctor after allowing him to catch his breath , his mother asks him to tell his father – who is presumably the recipient of the recording – why he is crying			0
choosing to ignore her question , the youngster carries on snivelling , so his mother asks him : ‘ where do you want to go ? ’ the boy replies with the rather blunt and humorous answer , ‘ pub ’ , to which his mother retorts : ‘ no , but we have to go to the doctors			0
’ refusing to back down , @entity5 continues to suggest the pair go the pub until his mother offers a compromise			2
when his mother asks @entity5 where it is he wants to go he hilariously replies by saying ' pub ' she says : ‘ ok , you know what ? when daddy gets home we will ask him			2
we will ask him if you can go to the pub later			0
’ please with her response , although not entirely convinced , the youngster immediately reminds his mother to ask			0
according to @entity5 ’s father , @entity48 , he normally takes his son out of the house and down to the local pub to give @entity5 's mum some peace and quiet			2
he said : ‘ i always get a beer and @entity5 always gets his hot chocolate			1
‘ true to the principles of @entity58 now associates sweets and hot chocolate with the pub. ‘ my guess as he gets older he 'll feel the same but his choice of chocolate will move to his choice of cask ale			1

the 20 - month - old named @entity5 is *relentless* in his demands to visit the pub
his mother proposes that they go to the pub later in the *day*
@entity75 says that he associates the pub with sweets and hot chocolate
