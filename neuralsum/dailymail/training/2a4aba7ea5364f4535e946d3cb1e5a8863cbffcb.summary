a chestnut pony found on the brink of starvation after suffering years of cruelty is now healthy and looking for a new home			1
@entity5 was found emaciated and infested with lice , but rescuers have now transformed him into the picture of a healthy horse			1
he was rescued by the @entity10 after he was found on a farm in @entity12 in april 2011 , with barely any hair remaining on his body and was nervous of almost all human contact			1
@entity5 , pictured with his trainer , was found emaciated and infested with lice , but he is now healthy and happy he was riddled with worms and left to wander in a concrete yard with no food or shelter			1
vets feared the pony , aged 18 months , would not survive , but after three years of intensive rehabilitation , @entity5 is almost unrecognisable			1
@entity24 , manager of the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ' we have put in a lot of time to help @entity5 gain confidence and become the healthy , happy horse he is today			1
' we are delighted that our efforts have developed him into a wonderful horse and hope to see him finally settled in a home of his own soon			0
' we 've seen many animals in extreme need but we 'll never forget the day that 18 - month - old @entity5 came to @entity10			2
' he was underfed , weak and infested with lice			0
the terrified pony 's muscles were severely wasted and he was riddled with worms			1
the chestnut pony , pictured in 2011 , was found emaciated on a farm in @entity47 with barely any hair on his body ' @entity5 's condition was so critical that it was going to be a battle to keep him alive			1
' he had been living in squalor , left to roam in a cement yard without any proper food , shelter or veterinary care			2
' she explained the rescue team first treated @entity5 's lice and worms before beginning a ' long , uphill process ' of building up his strength and teaching him to trust again			2
she added : ' after his traumatic past , it took him quite some time to adapt to life at the centre			0
' he did n't have much confidence , so his training progressed slowly , but surely			0
then , towards the end of last year he had a real breakthrough and his training came on in leaps and bounds			0
' sadly , we often never get to find out what happens to the owners who let animals get into this state , because prosecutions are handled by the @entity79 - all we know is that his previous owners handed him over willingly to @entity79 inspectors			0
' we had to be very patient with @entity5 , gradually getting him used to being handled and led out and about by the team here at the centre			2
' he 's a completely different pony to when he arrived all those months ago and he 's progressed so well that he 's now ready to be rehomed			0
' @entity10 helps over 40,000 sick , injured and unwanted pets every year			0
