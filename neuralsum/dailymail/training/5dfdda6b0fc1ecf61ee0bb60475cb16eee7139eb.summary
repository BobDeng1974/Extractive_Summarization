so when she emerged to find her mother and father and others in their party had vanished from the bar and outside she was naturally a little bemused			0
' where are my parents ? ' the eight - year - old asked staff at @entity13			2
whoops : @entity15 , pictured holding his daughter @entity16 at a wedding in 2007 , thought @entity18 had all their children but she thought @entity16 was with him they were clearly nowhere to be seen and had obviously left without her			1
but thankfully the landlord was well aware where these particular parents might be … because they were @entity15 and @entity18			1

' an insider at the pub added : ' i know there were a lot of children there that day but i still do n’t quite understand how they lost their daughter in such a small pub and then drove off without her			2

mr @entity162 added : ' he ’s a decent bloke who will come over and shake my hand			0
but how could you do that ? walk away and leave a baby ? ' parents on website @entity174 also expressed surprise at mr @entity15 ’s forgetfulness			0
one wrote : ' i do n’t understand how this could happen when they surely have police protection officers with them			0

the @entity54 only realised @entity16 was missing once they arrived home , two - miles away from the pub
@entity15 and @entity18 were travelling in separate cars and both *assumed* the little girl , 8 , was with in the other *vehicle*
@entity16 had gone to the toilet on her own without telling anyone
when @entity18 returned to collect her - after 15 minutes - she was found ' happily helping ' pub staff
landlord of the family pub leapt to @entity15 *'s* *defence* describing the @entity201 as a ' great father and genuine family man '
*spokeswoman* said @entity54 take full *responsibility* for looking after their children and were not *blaming* security officers
an *internal* police review is underway to discover how the little girl came to be left in the pub
