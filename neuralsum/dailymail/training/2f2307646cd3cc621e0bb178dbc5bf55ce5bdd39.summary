by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 10:02 est , 13 january 2014 a sadistic mother who masterminded a sickening attack in which her own sister - in - law was held captive in a flat and tortured for five days has been jailed for four years			1
@entity5 , 32 , and two men tied @entity7 up in a room in a flat in @entity10 , @entity11 , burned her with a gadget used to ' zap ' insects , cut her with a knife , cut all her hair cut off , and forced her to swallow a ' noxious substance ' along with a cocktail of medication			1
the incident apparently took place after the group ' took exception ' to something 36 - year - old @entity7 , who has learning difficulties , had said to @entity24			1
@entity25 : @entity5 was jailed along with @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) for torturing her sister - in - law @entity7 , who has learning difficulties , over a five day period in august 2012 at one stage @entity7 was taken to hospital when her lip ended up partially hanging off and became infected			1
but after treatment she was allowed back to the flat in @entity34 , @entity10 , @entity11 , when @entity24 ordered her to falsely tell medics she had been beaten up in the street			0
back at her makeshift cell , she was then subjected to yet more ' cruelty and degradation ' before one of the gang made a 999 call when she passed out			0
paramedics found @entity7 in a ' very dire state ' and was said to be ' very incoherent , injured , wrapped in a dirty duvet '			1
she woke up in hospital and is now recovering from her ordeal			0
details of the attack emerged at @entity50 where @entity24 - the mother ' of a number of children ' - admitted wounding , false imprisonment , administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon			1
@entity27 , 20 , from @entity57 was locked up for 42 months and @entity26 , 18 , of @entity10 , was given 12 months			0
the attack took place in a flat on @entity34 in @entity10 , @entity11			0
@entity7 had arrived with her husband @entity61 only two months earlier and initially stayed with her attacker before moving to a flat upstairs both admitted false imprisonment , administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon			1
earlier @entity68 , prosecuting , said the victim was a ' vulnerable young lady , with significant leaning difficulties			1
' she arrived in @entity10 in june 2012 with her husband @entity61 and initially stayed with @entity24 before moving to rent the flat upstairs			0
mr @entity68 added : ' between august 13 and august 17 , 2012 , @entity7 was subjected to a prolonged , cruel and degrading attack at the hands , at various times , of the three defendants			1
' she sustained physical and emotional harm during the course of that time			0
' the prosecutor said the attack began after the victim ’s husband was admitted to @entity82 unbeknown to his wife			2
she went downstairs in search of him and found @entity24 lying asleep on the sofa with two men inside the flat			2
mr @entity68 said @entity27 then ordered @entity7 to the floor by the window and then put the table over her , so it ’s legs were by her head at one end and her knees at the other			1
heaters were then put either side of her and she was ' tightly encased ' in that position			0
@entity27 then got a yard brush , put it on top of the table and she recalled feeling something wet on her legs			0
she thought it might be urine			0
the victim felt tingling in her legs and described what she thought was a ' zappy thing ' , which turned out to be a prohibited taser - type device , which had originally been used as an electronic fly swatter			1
the prosecutor said : ' clearly , at some stage during the course of that week - long period , she sustained an injury to her mouth , a serious tear to the upper lip			2
the lip was partially hanging off and became infected			0
' brutal : @entity5 admitted wounding , false imprisonment , administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon at @entity50 ( pictured )			1
she was sentenced to four years in prison @entity24 took the victim to hospital where she received stitches but told her sister - in - law to say her injury had been caused by two girls			1
but @entity7 did not go to the @entity130 for further treatment as advised			1
the prosecutor added : ' one can not say how exactly , or who exactly , caused that injury to the lip			0
the fact remains it was caused during the time of the false imprisonment			0
' the prosecutor said when the victim returned to the flat , she was made to go under the table again and one of her legs was tied up to the cord of one of the heaters			2
he added : ' the following day , as she believed it was , @entity27 zapped her on the arm four times with the taser and cut her hair			2
some of her husband ’s medication was there and @entity5 told the complainant to take some			2
' ' @entity27 made her drink some yellow fluid			2
he was part and parcel of the false imprisonment , administering the noxious substance and tasering			1
it beggars belief what these defendants were doing to her			0
' mr @entity68 said at one point @entity24 had taken a knife and started to cut downwards on @entity7 's arm until the victim passed out			1
paramedics were eventually called to a report that @entity7 had taken an overdose , only to be horrified when they arrived at the scene			1
one of the paramedics said			0
' she appeared as though she had not been cared for in any way			0
' in mitigation defence counsel @entity180 said : ' it ’s impossible to explain what would lead three people to behave in the terrible , despicable way that they did towards @entity7 , a lady who had done absolutely nothing to them			2
' ' the best guess is that something was said by @entity7			2
individually , none of the people in the dock would have behaved in the way that they did			0
' it would appear together they conducted themselves in a way that was out of character and out of the norm			0
the incident was dreadful and must have been terrible for @entity7 to endure			2
' @entity202 , judge @entity203 said : ' over several days this incident occurred which led to harm to @entity7 in a most cruel manner			1
this was a dreadful case			0

@entity5 , 32 , kept her sister - in - law in a ' dire state ' for five days
