we have all heard of killer heels , but how about shuddery stilettos ? or pubescent pumps ? @entity5 artist @entity4 has created a pair of hairy heels in the name of art , and the results are all kind of ewww			1
the flesh - coloured shoes , ironically called ' @entity16 ' , feature pointed toes , spiked heels and patches of human hair attached to silica gel			2
@entity5 artist @entity4 has created a pair of pink ' hairy ' pointed heels - called @entity16 would you wear these ? the heels are tied up as part of an exhibition by @entity4 in @entity5 standing at more than four inches high walking in them might be a tall order , even if you could get over the stomach - churning sight of the tufty toes			1
but the eye - catching shoes are not made for dancing the night away and are in fact designed to highlight how women 's footwear is sexualised			0
@entity4 , who was born in @entity5 but moved to the @entity40 in 2002 , implanted the individual hairs by hand before tying them together with chains and displaying them as a sculpture			1
height of fashion ? the hairy shoes have been described as ' the stuff of nightmares ' the pink , four - inch pointed heels are covered in human hair the hairy shoes have been described as having a ' revolting appearance ' design site @entity55 describes the piece of work as ' strands of hair [ that ] have been carefully implanted into the foot - shaped form , loosely arranged to highlight their undoubtedly revolting appearance			0
' the explicit connotations are evident as the sculptural wearables seek to convey their primary function as sexual commodities and as tools to increase attractiveness and lust			0
' the fash pack , though , are less impressed , @entity71 calling them ' the stuff of nightmares ' .			0

@entity5 artist @entity4 implanted each hair by hand
