by @entity0 published : 03:54 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 18:19 est , 29 january 2013 @entity1 apologised for the ' grotesque , offensive cartoon ' by @entity4 cartoonist @entity3 @entity1 and the acting editor of the @entity4 have apologised for a ‘ grotesque , offensive cartoon ’ published in the newspaper , which has been described as anti-semitic			1
the cartoon , by @entity3 , showed @entity10 prime minister @entity9 building a wall using what appeared to be the blood and limbs of @entity15			1
published on @entity17 and carrying the strapline ‘ @entity10 elections			1
will cementing peace continue ? ’ , it was condemned by chief rabbi @entity20			0
yesterday the acting editor of the @entity4 apologised for the cartoon at a meeting with representatives of the @entity26 community			2
@entity27 said : ‘ you will know that the @entity4 abhors anti-semitism and would never set out to cause offence to the @entity26 people – or any other ethnic or religious group			2
‘ everyone knows @entity3 is consistently brutal and bloody in his depictions , but last weekend – by his own admission – he crossed a line			1
the timing , on @entity17 , was inexcusable			0
’ in a statement mr @entity27 had said that insulting the memory of @entity17 victims or invoking blood libel was ' the last thing i or anyone connected with the @entity4 would countenance '			0
' the paper has long written strongly in defence of @entity10 and its security concerns , as have i as a columnist , ' he said			1
' we are , however , reminded of the sensitivities in this area by the reaction to the cartoon , and i will , of course , bear them very carefully in mind in future			0
' his apology followed that of mr @entity1 , who in a tweet , wrote : ‘ @entity3 has never reflected the opinions of the @entity4			1
' nevertheless , we owe major apology for grotesque , offensive cartoon			0
’ in a message to the @entity67 , in which he denied the newspaper permission to reproduce the cartoon , he said he ' very much regrets ' the timing of the cartoon			1
he said he had not been aware it was @entity17			0
@entity1 said @entity3 ( pictured ) , political cartoonist for the @entity4 , did not reflect the views of the paper jewish community leaders said they were disturbed by parallels they saw between the red - tinged drawing and historical anti-semitic propaganda			1
speaking to yesterday 's radio 4 today programme , @entity81 of the @entity67 said : ' i think you have to separate the difference between the right to publish something , and whether you always have to be offensive			1
' clearly there was a mistake made in printing the cartoon			0
i think the cartoon itself is disgusting			1
' whether there is a right to publish the cartoon is a different issue , i think it was a misjudgement and @entity98 have handled it absolutely right by apologising			0
' the @entity99 said it had lodged a complaint with the @entity101 as his cartoon of @entity9 was reminiscent of a blood libel – the centuries - old racist myth that @entity26 kill @entity107 children to drink their blood			2
the deputies said in a statement that the depiction of a @entity26 leader using blood for mortar ' is shockingly reminiscent of the blood libel imagery more usually found in parts of the virulently anti-semitic @entity118 press '			0
@entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , said he welcomed the ‘ genuine apology ’			0
earlier , @entity20 said the cartoon ‘ whether anti-semitic or not , has caused immense pain to the jewish community ’			0
he added : ‘ the danger of such images is that they reinforce a great slander of our time : that @entity26 , victims of the @entity17 , are now perpetrators of a similar crime against the @entity15			2
’ @entity133 , cartoonist in the @entity134 , jumped to the defence of @entity3 's cartoon			1
he said : ' for once , this was n't a bad cartoon			2
the problem with the state of @entity10 and the @entity143 lobby is that they never acknowledge the crime of ethnic cleansing on which the state was founded			1
' mr @entity3 said : ‘ this drawing was a criticism of @entity9 , and not of the @entity26 people : there was no slight whatsoever intended against them			2
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
