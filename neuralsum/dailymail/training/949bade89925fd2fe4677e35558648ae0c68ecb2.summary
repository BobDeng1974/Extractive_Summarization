' plastic - looking ' computer - generated characters in films and video games could soon be a thing of the past , thanks to a new high - definition animation technique			2
the results will be so lifelike that audiences will be able to see individual skin cells and hair follicles on animated characters played by real - life actors			2
researchers , whose previous methods were used in the 2009 film @entity14 , now say that they can scan patches on skin on a human face in such high resolution that every blemish , line or change in colour for different facial expressions can be captured on screen			1
new high - definition scanning techniques could make the faces of computer - generated characters look more realistic			1
previous methods developed by the same team were used in the 2009 film @entity14 , starring @entity30 teams from the @entity32 and @entity33 have developed a way of scanning centimetre - square patches of skin all over the face at a resolution of 10 micrometres			1
it means that just one skin cell covers three pixels on screen , reports the @entity43			1
the patches are then mapped on to the 3d model of the actor , which has been created by the actor wearing motion sensors as they perform			0
the scanning , which takes place in a laboratory , can also pick up the light that penetrates the surface of the skin and how it reacts to different types of light			2
professor @entity57 , of the graphics research team at @entity32 , told the newspaper : ' the bumpiness of the surface of the skin , at the micron scale , actually affects how light reflects off the surface			2
' that 's what makes it look healthy or oily or pasty or chalky			0
it makes someone look like a human being made out of organic material and not like a computer - generated zombie			0
' the new technique will make it cheaper and easier to add things such as spots , wrinkles and moles to the cgi faces , the @entity43 reports			0
it cost Â£ 150million to carry out the time - consuming work on @entity14 , directed by @entity81 , which was 60 per cent computer - generated			1
the cast , which included @entity30 , @entity85 and @entity86 , performed their roles with motion sensors attached to their bodies and faces and were then transformed by digital animators into the blue - skinned @entity92			0
characters created by computers , such as the @entity92 in @entity14 , will no longer be so ' plastic - looking ' video games developers at @entity96 have already come up with an algorithm that mimics the new scanner to speed up and reduce the cost of the process			1
dr @entity101 , of the computing department at @entity33 , has since worked with cosmetics firm @entity103 to see if the scanning facial technique could be used to analyse how skin reacts to make - up			0
he told the @entity43 that the detail involved in the technology could be used by medics and dermatologists , as well as shoppers wanting to find out how different shades of foundation will suit their skin .			0

high resolution scan means a skin cell would take up three pixels on screen
