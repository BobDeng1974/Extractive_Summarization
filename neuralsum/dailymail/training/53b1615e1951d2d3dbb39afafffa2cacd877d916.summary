when a strange ' highway ' was spotted in the skies in @entity3 , few people knew what had caused the unusual astronomical phenomenon			2
after investigating , meteorological experts think the bizarre pathway was created by a combination of sunbeams ' cast from over the horizon , ' clouds high in the sky and shadows			2
the striking photos of the unusual astronomical phenomena were spotted in the sky above @entity17 of @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity3			1
an unusual astronomical phenomena above the sky in @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 in @entity3			1
few people knew what had caused the unusual astronomical phenomenon @entity24 , forecaster at the @entity25 , told @entity26 : ' it ’s hard to be completely sure from a picture , but it ’s likely this [ sight ] is due to a phenomenon known as crepuscular rays - or sunbeams - being cast from over the horizon			1
' the sun is dim but still shining on parts of the cirrus cloud high up , but the dark blue section is due to shadows being cast			1
' the shadows are most likely caused by clouds which ca n't be seen from the observer 's point of view due to the curvature of the earth , ' he explained			0
@entity49 clouds are a type of atmospheric cloud generally characterised by thin , wispy strands , giving the clouds their @entity55 name , meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair			0
the cloud strands sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form and are referred to by the common name of ' mares ' tails '			0
meteorological experts from the @entity25 think the bizarre pathway was created by a combination of sunbeams ' cast from over the horizon , ' clouds high in the sky and shadows however , a spokesman for the @entity25 said the type of cloud ' is n't too important ' but it is the height of the clouds that really matters			1
he said : ' @entity49 is a high level cloud - normally with a cloud base at around 18,000to 40,000ft - and that ’s reflecting the light from the sun. ' the meteorological experts believe that lower level cloud - perhaps a cumulonimbus , which has a cloud base of about 1,200 to 6,500ft - is possibly causing a shadow , which is seen as the darker band or ' highway '			2
@entity91 rays play a key role in this strange sight and occur when the sun is behind irregular cloud which cast shadows			1
the @entity25 's spokesman explained : ' where there are no shadows , you get the effect of well defined sunbeams			2
@entity24 of the @entity25 , said : ' it ¿ s likely this [ sight ] is due to a phenomenon known as crepuscular rays being cast from over the @entity107 sun is dim but still shining on parts of the cirrus cloud high up , but the dark blue section is due to shadows being cast			1
' ' in the case of the picture , there is only one shadow , which creates the dark patch across the sky			0
' however , the experts could not rule out the unlikely possibility that high mountains could have cast the shadow instead of a cloud without an in - depth knowledge of the region 's geography			0
@entity127 , founder of the @entity128 , agreed with the @entity25 's explanation and added that the optical effects caused by the shadow cast by convection clouds are coming from behind the photographer , as is the light from the sun. he said : ' the shadows that these tall clouds are casting onto the layer of cloud ahead appear to converge towards a point on the horizon due to the effect of perspective			1
it is similar to the way that train tracks appear to converge off in the distance			0
' mr @entity148 that the effect could actually be described as ' anti-crespular rays ' as they converge as they recede into the distance			0
' anti-crepuscular rays are not common , especially rare and dramatic examples like these , ' he added .			0

the strange sight was photographed above @entity17 of @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity3
the @entity25 said image is due to a phenomenon known as crepuscular rays - or sunbeams - being cast from over the horizon
the sun is dim but still shining on parts of the cirrus cloud high up , but the dark blue section is due to shadows being cast by lower clouds
