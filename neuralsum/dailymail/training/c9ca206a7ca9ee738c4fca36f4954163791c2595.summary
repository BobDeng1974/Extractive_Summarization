for the purists and the patriots , there can be only one winner when the race for the @entity6 crown reaches its climax just before 5pm on sunday			2
and it will not be @entity9			2
@entity9 ’s players suspect that respect for them and their football is the one quality that is in short supply as they sit just 90 minutes away from their second title in three seasons			1
and their concern can only be heightened by the admission from @entity20 chairman @entity19 that he finds it ‘ depressing ’ that a team can challenge for the biggest prize in the @entity24 game with so few englishmen among their ranks			1
so close : @entity9 will win their second league title in three years if they do n't lose to @entity29 @entity19 , who has drawn up controversial proposals that have now been published following an investigation into the dearth of top - quality @entity24 players , used the occasion to again voice his fears that top clubs are paying scant regard to the needs of the national side			1
‘ it ’s been a brilliant league this year , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ but there are only two regular @entity24 players at @entity9 , and two or three at @entity44 , and that ’s pretty depressing			1
’ although @entity9 seem destined to be champions , plenty of neutrals would prefer to see @entity49 win the title			1
and @entity19 acknowledges the part played in the @entity54 club ’s challenge by their @entity24 contingent			1
‘ it ’s good news for @entity58 and good news for the campaign in @entity61 , ’ he said			2
the statistics tell their own story			0
while six @entity24 players have featured in more than 20 matches in @entity49 ’s challenge , only @entity64 and @entity65 at @entity9 have played in more than 10			1
and while @entity49 have had englishmen on the field for more than 40 per cent of the total time played , that figure is an alarmingly low 14 per cent at @entity9			1
quota : @entity49 have had six @entity24 players play more than 20 matches in their title challenge even @entity9 ’s achievement in scoring @entity77 goals has gone largely unnoticed while the @entity78 have hogged the limelight thanks to the scoring exploits of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
homegrown : @entity65 is one of two englishmen to play over 10 games this season in the league for @entity9 with @entity9 needing just a point at home to @entity29 today to be champions — @entity49 must beat @entity91 in case @entity93 ’s men slip up — nobody feels the lack of respect more deeply than @entity9 defender @entity98			1
after savage criticism , it is personal			0
written off as a slow , pony - tailed buffoon as @entity9 were beaten by @entity44 and @entity102 , the former @entity103 and @entity104 defender has come to symbolise the club ’s great comeback			1
from being regarded as a joke by @entity9 fans and lambasted in tv studios , he is fast - emerging a popular cult figure and his remarkable renaissance has vindicated @entity93 ’s decision to bring the 33 - year - old over from @entity114 where they had worked together at @entity115			1
‘ the people who criticised me needed to be more respectful of me and what i ’ve done during my career , ’ said @entity98			0
‘ i ’ve now played nearly 11 years in @entity119 , including eight at @entity103 and i ’ve won many trophies			0
that is not by chance			0
but i ’m very grateful to @entity93 for the support he has shown me			2
’ @entity98 also scored for @entity104 at the last @entity125 but that pedigree was ignored when he was sent off in the @entity127 for bringing down @entity128			0
it was only when he became the team ’s leader after @entity132 was sent off at @entity133 on march 15 that his and @entity9 ’s season was transformed			2
32 per cent of players who featured in the @entity6 this season were qualified for @entity24 — the lowest ever			1
169 of the 532 players who appeared in the top flight are available to @entity24 boss @entity58			2
103 of those have played more than 900 minutes , the equivalent of 10 games or more , and just 75 have played more than half the minutes possible			2
23 per cent of the total minutes possible were played by @entity24 players at the top four clubs			1
14 per cent of those total minutes played by @entity24 players at @entity9			1
16 per cent by @entity24 players at @entity144			1
24 per cent by @entity24 players at @entity44			1
40 per cent of total minutes by @entity24 players at @entity49			1
5 @entity24 players aged 18 - 21 played more than half the possible minutes			1
13 countries at this @entity125 have stars who ’ve had more time per player in the @entity6 than @entity24 players this season			1
solid : city petered off after a fine winter period , but have come back strong ‘ i did n’t read and i try not to listen to too much of the criticism , but there was too much of it , ’ he said			0
‘ the penalty against @entity128 and @entity102 was one incident in a match where i actually thought i was playing really well			0
represent : @entity64 is the only other @entity162 player to play more than 10 league games ‘ i started the season with an injury and i needed time to adjust physically			1
but as time has gone on , i have found my rhythm and been on an upward curve			0
and since that @entity102 game , i feel i ’ve played at a high level for the last three months			0
‘ i ’ve been through a lot of this through my career			0
but at no point did i stop believing in my own ability			0
i always thought i could do this and i ’m now where i want to be			0
i was well - respected in @entity177 who won many titles			0
there were no problems in @entity182 but i was a newly - arrived foreign player here			0
’ what was damaging when @entity98 struggled was that it reflected badly on @entity93 ’s judgment			2
while @entity49 boss @entity186 was lauded for his attacking philosophy and @entity44 ’s @entity188 hailed as a master of tactics , @entity9 lost their way after @entity193 ’s injury problems began in late january and the old doubts over @entity93 — he has never won a major trophy in @entity119 — resurfaced			1
defeats against @entity102 and @entity197 in the @entity198 destroyed a tilt at a unique @entity200 although @entity9 did win the @entity201			2
yet when @entity44 and @entity49 slipped recently , @entity9 took advantage			1
@entity44 lost at @entity203 , @entity49 only drew there but @entity9 won 2 - 0 at @entity204			1
having failed to lift @entity114 with @entity205 , @entity93 is about to become a major winner			2
and he thinks the @entity6 would be a bigger achievement			2
‘ the @entity6 is the hardest to win			2
it ’s the most competitive , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity102 and @entity205 have important players , so do @entity103 , but here there are five or six teams with a lot of potential in their squad			0
the intensity makes it different to anywhere else — every game is a final			0
’ he is taking nothing for granted today even though @entity29 are safe and have nothing to play for			2
‘ we ’ve planned for @entity29			0
we always consider the other team and their characteristics , ’ he said			0
national man : @entity19 says it would be depressing for @entity9 to win the title with such little @entity24 representation ‘ @entity227 is a very important player			1
@entity29 play a lot to his strengths and we must be worried about that , pay attention and concentrate with our defending			0
’ @entity9 nearly slipped up two years ago in the final game against @entity233 before @entity193 ’s late winner , so there will be no complacency today			1
@entity98 is amused at the prospect of a duel with another ‘ pony - tail ’ in this title decider			2
‘ @entity227 ’s hair is more tied up in a bun really , ’ he said , smiling ‘ i ’ve never played against him before but he ’s not the only big striker in the @entity6			2
i trust in my experience and know how to deal with him			0
’ if ‘ @entity248 ’ was the hero in 2012 , there are no shortage of candidates this time around			0
@entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 have each scored more than 20 goals this season and @entity256 is the best player in the league on current form			0
title if @entity9 win today , they will win the title whatever happens @entity263 draw , then @entity49 can win the title by beating @entity91 by a 13 - goal @entity265 lose , any win for @entity49 will be good enough to take the title			1
a draw wo n’t be			0
@entity269 @entity263 , @entity49 , and @entity44 will go into the @entity127 group stage directly , and @entity144 into the play - off @entity271 will go into the @entity272 , and be joined by @entity273 unless @entity273 lose at home to @entity275 and @entity276 win at @entity277 , in which case @entity276 not @entity273 will go into @entity272 qualifying			1
@entity133 are @entity281 football via being @entity198 finalists			0
relegation @entity283 and @entity284 are down and will be joined by @entity285 barring an impossibly freakish win over @entity144 at the same time as a home defeat for @entity288 by @entity289 in which @entity285 overturn a 17 - goal goal difference between themselves and @entity288			2
success : @entity9 are on the verge of winning their second league title in three years @entity296 , newly picked for the @entity61 @entity125 party , thinks @entity9 ’s squad have given them the advantage			1
‘ we have a lot of options			0
we can change the games with substitutions and the manager has made a lot of good decisions on that			0
’ if @entity9 win today , their fans will hope it ushers in a new era of domination , similar to @entity49 and @entity276			1
financial fair play restrictions might be their biggest obstacle in the long term but @entity296 said : ‘ what happens tomorrow , nobody can know			0
but the club has built a team to win trophies			0
‘ we ’ve won one title this year already and now we have the chance to win a second one			0
and the next years we ’re going to try to do the same thing			0

@entity93 *'s* side have used just two englishmen for more than 10 league games this term - @entity65 and @entity64
challengers @entity49 have used six englishmen for over 20 league games
@entity19 : ' there are only two regular @entity24 players at @entity9 , and two or three at @entity44 , and that ’s pretty depressing ’
@entity9 will win the @entity6 title if they avoid defeat to @entity29
