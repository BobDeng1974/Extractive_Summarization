by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 12 november 2013 a coroner has warned of the dangers of so - called ' legal highs ' after a teenager died from taking a drug he ordered online marked ' not for human consumption '			1
@entity7 , 18 , died on august 18 this year after taking the psychoactive substance @entity8 at his home in @entity11 , @entity12 , after purchasing it from a website			1
an inquest heard how the keen football fan had told a friend he planned to take the drug , which he believed had the same effects as ecstasy , but died four days later			1
@entity7 , 18 , died in hospital four days after taking the drug @entity8 after ordering it online he told his friend that he had bought two grams of the substance , as well as etizolam , though there was no trace of the second drug in his system			1
@entity7 's mother , @entity30 , returned home from work to hear her son calling for help from his bedroom			2
' he was sweating and shaking			0
she immediately phoned for help and ambulance staff arrived a short while later and took @entity7 to hospital , ' the inquest was told			2
the teenager died four days later at @entity42 after being put in a medically - induced coma			2
the inquest heard police discovered @entity7 had researched @entity8 and legal highs on the internet after his computer was seized			1
packets containing the drugs were also found , with each bearing a ' not for human consumption ' warning			0
@entity54 dr @entity53 said a post mortem found he had died of multiple organ failure caused by taking almost 1g of the drug , @entity8			1
he said : ' one of the problems of buying medicines from unregulated manufacturers is the individual awareness of the concentration of the substance in the drug provided may bear no resemblance to the actual concentration , that puts an even greater risk in the ingestion of substances that are unregulated			2
' detective sergeant @entity71 , of @entity12 police , said that @entity7 had been looking forward to watching an @entity74 football match with his father on the day			1
he said : ' @entity7 was an 18 - year - old male who enjoyed a normal , happy life living with his mother			1
he was a happy person with lots of friends , he enjoyed normal activities including computer gaming and football			0
' coroner @entity83 ruled his death had been accidentally caused by experimenting with the drug , before warning : ' anyone taking this kind of drug in any kind of quantity is potentially walking into the unknown , into disaster really			2
' speaking to the boy 's family he added : ' it was sadly an experimentation gone wrong			0
i would like to express my very sincere condolences to everyone			0
' the teenager died in hospital in @entity11 four days after being put in a medically - induced coma by doctors mr @entity83 also advised parents to raise the issue with their children , especially if they were behaving unusually			0
though the drugs @entity8 and etizolam are not prohibited under the misuse of drugs act , they are not safe to use , according to mr @entity71			1
he explained the difficulty of legislating against such substances as a slight change in their composition could lead to them falling into a different class of drug that would is n't prohibited			0
speaking after the inquest , he said : ' our concern is that people have the perception that because they are marketed with the term legal high that they are safe			1
' the point we are trying to make is that there is no process to ensure what is written on the packet is what is in there because they are unregulated			0
' people consider them to be safe because they are not illegal but in fact they can be more of a danger than other substances on the market			2
' @entity8 , which has similar effects to amphetamines , was developed to tackle depression but was later ruled out as a suitable medication because of its hallucinogenic properties			2
ms @entity30 and @entity7 's father , @entity142 , released a statement through police paying tribute to their son at the time of his death			1
@entity7 , who ' loved football and was a @entity151 season ticket - holder ' was described as a ' very normal young man '			2
' he did well at school and just two years ago he left with 11 gcse a-c passes and had gone on to study electrical engineering at college in an attempt to follow in his dad â€™s footsteps , ' his parents said			0
' he was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly			0
one of the things we will always remember though about him was his fantastic sense of humour			0
it is very hard to think we will not get to laugh or talk with him any more			0
' his life had such potential and was all in front of him			0
sadly it has been cut prematurely very short			0
' ' legal highs ' like mephedrone , pictured , are often marketed as plant food or bath salts ' legal highs ' are substances which produce a similar effect to drugs like cocaine , cannabis and ecstasy , but are not controlled by the @entity183			1
these new substances are not yet controlled because there is not enough research to base a decision on			0
more and more ' legal highs ' are being researched to see the dangers they pose , and if they should be made illegal			1
the drugs can not be sold for human consumption and so they are often marketed as bath salts or plant food to get around the law			0
while not considered illegal , that does not mean ' legal highs ' are safe			1
you can not be sure what is in the substance , or what effect it might have on your body			0
' legal highs ' including @entity205 , @entity206 and 5 - it have been directly linked to emergency hosptial admissions , and in some cases deaths			1
' legal highs ' fall into one of three categories : taking ' legal highs ' carries a great risk and can be very unpredictable			1
the chemicals they contain in many cases have not been used in drugs for human consumption before and so have not been tested to show they are safe			2
the risk can be augmented if the substances are taken with alcohol , in extreme cases the mixture can result in death			0
it is likely that drugs marketed as ' legal highs ' may contain substances that are actually illegal to possess .			1

@entity7 , 18 , died after taking one gram of drug @entity8
@entity234 bought the substance online after researching ' legal highs '
police expressed concern people think drugs are safe if considered legal
