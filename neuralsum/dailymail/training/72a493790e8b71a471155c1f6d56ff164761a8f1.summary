a @entity1 tourist faced down a charging elephant and stopped it in its tracks with just a wave of his hand			1
@entity7 , 27 , was visiting @entity8 , northern @entity1 , when the elephant came charging straight towards him out of the dense jungle			1
but rather than understandably screaming and running for his life , mr @entity7 simply held up his hand up to the animal , which stopped , turned around , and walked away			2
you shall not pass ! @entity14 wards off an elephant charge with a wave of his hand maybe i wo n't squash you after all , human : the rampaging elephant amazingly seems to comply err , yes : the beast gives an almighty shriek and turns away from the intrepid tourist ... who wastes no time in holding up his camera and firing off a few frames of the departing pachyderm a video of mr @entity7 's bravery has now been viewed millions of times online			2
mr @entity7 , an engineer from @entity30 , near @entity31 , told the @entity32 that he had quit his job out of boredom and was spending a month travelling around his country while he looks for new direction in life			1
it was the afternoon of february 28 when he was making his way along a dirt path at @entity8 with his friend @entity41 , on their way back to civilisation after going to see a dinosaur footprint			1
the reserve is home to around a hundred wild @entity49 elephants , cared for by the @entity1 royal family - sponsored @entity50			1
mr @entity7 was visiting during the local summer season , when @entity8 blossoms with colourful dendrobiums , white wild orchids , and white and red rhododendrons			1
mr @entity7 told @entity32 reporter @entity56 that when he first saw the elephant , a moment not included in the clip , he froze and stared at it for a long time			0
he tried to edge away , but the elephant tracked his every move , he said			0
mr @entity7 admitted he was afraid			0
extending his hand at the animal was merely his first reaction , he admitted - a completely unpremeditated response			1
' but i 'm sure , ' he said			0
' it did n't want to hurt me			0
' and indeed it did n't for , as the video shows , mere inches from mr @entity7 's outstretched arm , the elephant stops , lets out a fierce shriek , and turns away			0
fear : mr @entity76 said he had spent a long time frozen to the spot staring after he saw the elephant in the bush he said he was frightened when it charged , but looking back he thinks it did n't want to hurt him as it pads off into the bush , mr @entity7 showed just how much composure he had maintained by holding up his camera and capturing a few shots of the retreating animal for his photo album			1
he then turns to mr @entity41 , who was filming the incident , and chuckles			0
mr @entity7 told the @entity32 his sanguine reaction in the face of near certain death beneath the stomping feet of the elephant was just down to his positive attitude			0
' i always think ( everything that happens to me ) is a special moment and i think i 'm lucky to have had the chance to experience that , ' he was quoted as saying			2
' i do n't need ( to think of things ) as bad memories			0
so i smile to make it a good situation			2
' despite their popular association with @entity1 , often as domesticated beasts of burden , @entity49 elephants are an endangered species because of the illegal trade in ivory			1
they grow up to 10ft tall and can weigh as much as 5.5 tons .			0

@entity76 was visiting a *wildlife* reserve as he travelled around @entity1
he said his actions came as a *spontaneous* response to the situation
the @entity1 engineer says he looks back on the experience positively
