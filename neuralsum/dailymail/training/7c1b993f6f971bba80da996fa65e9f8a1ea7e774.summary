@entity1 co-owner @entity0 has condemned those @entity3 fans who contributed to helping paying off a fellow supporter 's fine after he was convicted of invading the pitch during their @entity8 opener against @entity9			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , became an internet sensation after he kicked the ball towards the goal when @entity1 were defending a free - kick at @entity3 last month			1
the 22 - year - old was convicted for the offence of ' entering the playing area ' and was told to pay £ 305 but was sparred a ban from attending future matches			1
@entity32 believes that @entity10 's example could set a dangerous precedent in the future which could lead to dire consequences with more fans potentially misbehaving in grounds on the basis they know their fine can be split amongst other supporters			1
' well meaning fans have paid the ' pitch invaders ' fine , ' @entity0 tweeted			1
' i 'm fearful that this will encourage more such events , with dire consequences			0
whilst in court , @entity10 apologised for a ' moment of madness ' as he pleaded guilty to a charge under @entity52 of the @entity53 1991 , which states that it is an offence to go on to the playing area without lawful authority or excuse			2
naughty boy : @entity10 saw his £ 305 fine paid off with the help of fellow @entity3 fans passing sentence at @entity63 in @entity64 , district judge @entity65 said : ' on the afternoon of august 16 about 35,000 football fans sat down at @entity3 to watch 22 men in shorts and football boots kick a football around for 90 minutes			1
' those 22 men were paid for that , to entertain			0
' some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch			2
you were n't paid to do that			0
' the judge said he proceeded to run ' some 70 yards ' across the pitch , chased by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where @entity9 were lining up a free kick			1
hold up : @entity10 ( right ) was fined after he ran onto the pitch during @entity1 's clash at home to @entity9 the judge said : ' you took it for them			1
to be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball			0
' it was a longer run than was strictly necessary			0
' you had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like @entity101			0
' regrettably it was about 30mph slower than @entity101			0
' @entity103 away : @entity10 celebrated his effort wildly whilst running away from the match stewards the judge said the effort was ' easily ' saved by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity108 but referred to @entity110 's subsequent effort after play restarted , saying : ' i understand that the professional footballer who followed you did not do any better			1
' judge @entity65 said the shot drew ' the cheers of the crowd ' before he was tackled ' in the customary manner ' by stewards			0
he also said it was a ' small mercy ' that @entity10 had ' decided to remain fully clothed '			2
showing restraint : an intoxicated @entity10 ( centre ) tried to fight off the presence of stewards after being caught @entity10 , who smiled as the judge compared his effort to the former @entity128 captain , told police it had been a dream of his to play at the home of his favourite team @entity1 from a young age			1
the judge said : ' you told the police and you tell this court that having achieved your childhood ambition you wo n't be doing it again			0
' others need to be deterred from attempting to do what you did otherwise football matches would become very tedious affairs if everyone was allowed to run onto the pitch			0
' the judge said a greater risk was that ' drunken hooligans ' may invade the pitch and attack players though he said he accepted that @entity10 had ' no violent motivation '			1
he said he could not condone the offence but must also put it into perspective			0
the judge declined to impose a football banning order called for by the prosecution , saying he was taking into account @entity10 's previous good character , his ' motivations ' on the day , the remorse he expressed and the fact that ' you will not want disappoint your young son ' by repeating the stunt			1
let 's ' ave it : @entity10 sticks his tongue out to the @entity3 crowd as he is escorted away from the ground @entity10 told police in interview he had been a @entity1 fan since he was a little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to ' run on the pitch and kick the ball ' , the court heard			1
@entity176 , prosecuting , added : ' now he could say he had done it			0
he also said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it again			0
' earlier @entity10 told the judge he was ' sorry ' for committing the offence and admitted he had drunk around six beers before the match but denied being a ' hooligan ' , ' thug ' or ' yob '			2
asked what was going through his mind , @entity10 said : ' nothing really - it was just a moment of madness			2
it was a spur of the moment thing			0
' the judge said he had seen footage of the incident on @entity199 and asked : ' were you intending to take the free kick ? ' @entity10 replied : ' no. all i was going to do was run and as i was running i just saw the ball there so i thought i would just kick it			2
' matchwinning moment : @entity9 won the game 1 - 0 thanks to a late @entity23 ( left ) strike @entity10 , who works as a receptionist at a hotel , said he has a ten - month old little boy			1
referring to the prospect of a banning order , he said : ' i was a bit concerned that when my little boy grows up i want to take him to watch the football			0
' the judge asked if his mother had ' expressed disapproval '			0
@entity10 , who represented himself , said : ' at first she was concerned because she did n't know the consequences but when she saw the @entity199 video she saw the funny side but she has had a go at me , as a mother would			2
' mocked : one fan on @entity228 commented that @entity10 's free - kick was better than @entity110 's effort he declined to comment after the hearing			1
the pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media , with one fan saying the effort was better than @entity238 's free kick once play had resumed			2
he wrote on @entity228 : ' fair play to that pitch invader at @entity1 v @entity9			1
. he got the free kick on target when @entity110 could n't			0

@entity0 is worried that @entity1 fans have set a dangerous precedent
@entity1 fans helped pay off a @entity10 @entity10 's £ 305 fine for pitch invading
@entity10 , a @entity1 fan , ran onto the pitch during club 's @entity8 opener against @entity9
@entity32 believes the actions of @entity10 and those who paid the fine could lead to more *frequent* *unsavoury* events
