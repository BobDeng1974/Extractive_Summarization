the father of the @entity2 woman ordered by @entity4 judges to give up her baby after a forced caesarean has backed the court ’s decision to put the child up for adoption			1

' she 's a threat ' : @entity11 has backed the court 's decision to put his daughter 's baby up for adoption ‘ it may seem harsh , ’ mr @entity11 said , ‘ but i do not believe my daughter should be allowed to keep the baby			1
’ the child , now 15 months old and who can not be named for legal reasons , is in care in the @entity4 on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive @entity34			1
the case has sparked a wave of anger with mps condemning the treatment of @entity12 , 35 , as totalitarian			2
but speaking last night , mr @entity11 , 73 , said : ‘ at the time i did question whether the @entity4 authorities were being heavy - handed , but knowing @entity12 like i do , i believe they were acting in her best interests			2
‘ at that point she had stopped taking her medication and was extremely agitated			2
she was not mentally well enough to take care of her baby			1
together : @entity51 , who suffers from bipolar disorder , is pictured with her child in @entity54 ‘ my worry is that if she is given custody and stops taking her medication again , as she has done countless times , she will become a threat to the child			1
‘ i see @entity12 most days and i have asked her , “ how can you cope as a mother ? you already have two children who are looked after by your mother so how can you care for a third ? ’ ’ ’ mr @entity11 said his daughter began suffering from bipolar disorder after moving in 2001 to @entity65 to work as a waitress			1
‘ within three months she had married and fallen pregnant			2
it was around that time that her behaviour became very strange			2
‘ i visited @entity12 five or six times while she was in @entity70 and i was shocked by what i found			2
‘ it was as if she was two people , one minute normal and fine , the next paranoid and talking about how people were spying on her			2
‘ she became obsessed with keys and would steal them from friends , family , whoever			2
all over her house she had drawers full of keys			2
‘ she was always very paranoid about losing her own keys			2
she would lose them all the time but would think people were stealing them			0
‘ it began to affect her work and she started going into the restaurant dressed in increasingly bizarre outfits			0
her manager became frustrated with her and urged her to seek help			0
her response was just to get angry and in the end she had to let her go			0
’ mr @entity11 said that @entity12 separated from the father of her child in 2004 and the child was adopted by the father ’s sister in @entity70			1
@entity12 finally sought help from a doctor in 2007 and was given medication that helped with her erratic moods			0
however , once it started to work , her father said , she believed she did n’t need it any more and stopped			1
‘ her symptoms flared up again and in 2008 her mother @entity109 and i had become so worried that we begged her to come home to @entity2 so we could take care of her and she agreed			1
outrage : how the story was reported in the @entity115 last week close family : miss @entity51 is pictured with her eldest child , father @entity117 and mother @entity109 in the @entity70 in 2004 ‘ she came to stay with me and i convinced her to go to see a doctor at hospital			1
the doctor told her that she would benefit from a stay at the psychiatric ward			0
’ she was discharged after a week ’s stay in @entity127 near @entity128 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder			0
mr @entity11 said she applied to have her child returned from @entity70 in 2008			1
the application was granted on the grounds her daughter would live with @entity12 ’s mother , who is divorced from her father			1
he said : ‘ @entity12 was receiving the right treatment and started to get things back together but wanted to go back to @entity70 to meet an old boyfriend			0
she went in 2009 and came back a few months later pregnant with his child			1
’ @entity12 stopped taking her medication in case it harmed the unborn baby and became unwell again			1
she was admitted to a psychiatric clinic in @entity145			0
her father said : ‘ she was discharged and came to stay with me to give birth to her second daughter			1
social services made a court order and the second baby also went to live with her mother			1
she was very angry and accused us of stealing her children , but it was a decision made by a court and for her best interests			1
’ but after this , @entity12 went back on her medication , held down a job at a hotel and was seeing her children every day			0
then in 2012 she met a @entity164 man in a @entity166 nightclub who said he was a basketball player			0

in a closed hearing , the local health trust made an application to the @entity34 on august 23 and were granted permission by mr @entity200 to perform a caesarean without her consent			1
the judge ruled it was in the mother ’s best interests and she was too mentally ill to make the decision herself			1
the following day @entity208 applied for a temporary care order and the newborn baby was taken away			1
mr @entity11 found out what had happened and @entity12 was flown back to @entity2 , accompanied by @entity4 social workers			0
ruling : following miss @entity51 's unsuccessful appeal , @entity214 , pictured , obtained permission to place her child for adoption he said : ‘ i met them at the airport			1
the social services asked whether @entity222 or @entity109 would take the baby , but i am too old and @entity109 is already looking after @entity12 ’s other two children			1
‘ the authorities even went to ask the father in @entity166 if he would take care of the child but he is an illegal immigrant with no job so was not a suitable father			1
’ again , @entity12 began taking her medication and she was well enough to get a job caring for an elderly couple near where her mother lives with her daughters , now aged 11 and four , in @entity236			0
in february , judge @entity237 began the adoption process at @entity239			2
in may , @entity12 applied through the @entity2 courts for custody of the child , but the court ruled that the baby must remain in @entity54			1
she challenged the decision in october at @entity246 but her appeal failed and @entity214 obtained permission to place the child for adoption			1

last night , @entity12 ’s @entity2 lawyer @entity256 said he would lodge an appeal			0
@entity12 , who is allowed to visit the child during her visits to @entity54 for hearings , has said she is committed to her medication and would like the child to be returned to a foster home in @entity2 so she can prove she is a responsible mother			2
she said : ‘ i may have had three children by three different fathers , but it does not mean i am not a good and caring mother			0
i have never done anything to hurt my other two daughters and i never would			0

‘ it was almost the tenth anniversary of when my baby boy – whom i had named @entity295 – was killed and it brought back the horror of what was done to me			2
‘ this country needs to look at the way hospitals treat women who are distressed			0
' too often they brand them as seriously mentally ill , in my view to cover up the appalling shortcomings in the system and the way they deal with them			0
’ in ms @entity273 ’s case , the health trust admitted that she had not received adequate counselling and that the procedure had gone ahead without confirmation of her consent or consultation with a surgeon			0
ms @entity273 , of @entity318 , @entity208 , was 36 when she fell pregnant to her fiance in 2003			0
