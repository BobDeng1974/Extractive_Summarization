@entity0 admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against @entity3 as he eased to a lop - sided points win in @entity5			1
the 24 - year - old has been billed as the next @entity7 due to his impressive fan base and close to 10,000 packed into the @entity9 on saturday night			1
accompanied to the ring by @entity12 , the featherweight was never in trouble but failed to deliver the stoppage that had looked a formality during the contest			1

@entity3 fought for the same belt last december when he drew with @entity35 and the @entity37 's record of 19 wins from 24 fights suggested he would struggle against @entity40 who is now unbeaten in 21 contests			1
the 24 - year - old has been billed as the next @entity7 due to his impressive fan base @entity0 admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against @entity3 ( right ) @entity3 , a year older than his opponent , had previously boxed at both bantamweight and lightweight before opting to settle for the division in between			1
and he was certainly the smaller man in the ring as @entity40 made a fast start , picking the visitor off with punches to both head and body			0
@entity3 had previously been stopped twice and was content to fight on the back foot , his face marking up in the second round although the @entity37 did attempt to mount a response			2
he briefly threatened midway through the third session with his first sustained attack but @entity40 finished the stronger			0
@entity3 of the @entity37 looks to land a punch during the bout at the @entity9 in @entity5 after an even fourth , @entity3 stepped on the accelerator in the fifth before @entity40 fought back			2
bizarrely , the bell to end the stanza did not ring until four minutes had passed , allowing the home favourite to drive home his advantage			0
@entity3 looked exhausted as he retreated to his corner but was given a brief break in the sixth round when a beach ball thrown from the crowd interrupted the action			2
the timekeeper then stopped the action almost 60 seconds early , attempting to rectify his earlier mistake			0
judges awarded @entity40 a landslide victory by scores of 119 - 109 twice and and 119 - 110 @entity3 looked ready to fold several times during the seventh and eighth rounds before showing remarkable heart to find a response			1
if there has been a criticism of @entity0 's career to date it is that he lacks the power needed at the top level and despite throwing everything at @entity93 , the @entity37 was still standing at the start of the penultimate round			0
and he deservedly heard the final bell as @entity40 failed to deliver the stoppage in the last session before the judges awarded him a landslide victory by scores of 119 - 109 twice and and 119 - 110			0
