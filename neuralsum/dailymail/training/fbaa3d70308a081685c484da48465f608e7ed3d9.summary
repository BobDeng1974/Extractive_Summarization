the number 10 has always inferred something mystical , implying an almost divine talent to elevate the sport into the heavens and produce the game ’s defining moments			2
from @entity8 and @entity9 , to @entity10 and @entity11 , these are the ‘ game - changers ’ , the graceful technicians who glide effortlessly like ice - skaters and instinctively seek out space and angles among the gangs of opponents			2
they are the headline - makers , the ones who speak a language unintelligible to us mortals			0
this @entity23 has been no different , the star performances produced by those whose jerseys are adorned by that famous number : @entity28 for @entity29 , @entity30 for @entity31 , @entity32 for @entity33			1
change : traditional centre forwards have struggled in @entity29 and number 10s like @entity28 have flourished class : the @entity23 has always featured great number 10s like @entity38 's @entity11 memorable : @entity31 's @entity8 was also a number 10 and a legend of the game @entity42 : @entity29 's @entity10 is another great @entity23 number 10 skilful : @entity38 's @entity9 was a brilliant number 10 in the 1980s poor : traditional centre forwards like @entity48 's @entity47 have struggled at the @entity23 others special showings have come from those players awarded the freedom to flit between the lines and commit opponents , such as @entity55 for @entity56 and @entity57 for @entity58			1
these five players , without question the most influential in @entity29 , have twenty goals between them and make up five of the top six scorers in the competition			1
there is nothing new in the phenomenon of the magical number 10 , yet their overbearing influence on this @entity23 , assuming all the striking responsibility , presents the question as to where the conventional forward has disappeared			1
the central striker have fallen into a black hole , the number 10 ’s deprived of a lethal partner , increasingly tasked as the solo artists that must bring the rest of the band to life			2
so what of the number 9 , is he now consigned to the role of foil , offering merely perspiration to facilitate the inspiration of mr 10 ? the evidence of this @entity23 would presume so			1
star : @entity31 's @entity30 has lit up the @entity23 in @entity29 with four goals in four games clinical : @entity32 has netted five goals and number 10s make up five of the top six scorers for @entity29 , @entity97 has barely registered , a lamentable apology for the host nation ’s whose heights have been scaled by @entity101 and @entity102 in recent years			1
he has touched the ball just ninety times in four games , compared to the 264 times that @entity28 ’s golden boots have caressed the @entity107			1
others have fallen beneath their usual level , @entity110 and @entity111 the shade to @entity30 ’s light for @entity31			1
@entity114 forward @entity111 has played four matches , failing to score or complete a dribble and offering just one assist as a contribution			1
this @entity23 has exposed the traditional centre forward role as a dying art , deemed as a luxury as tactics evolve			1
theories abound over the need to contribute to every phase of play , to take part in the defensive effort rather than merely apply the finishing flourish			0
would a @entity129 or @entity130 be indulged by an international coach in this era ? possibly not			0
goals are no longer the currency by which strikers are judged			0
awful : @entity29 centre forward @entity97 has struggled to show any sort of form during the @entity23 unusual : @entity56 's @entity138 has bucked the trend of centre forwards and scored three goals @entity47 toiled with little success for @entity48 before being dropped			1
@entity58 have not started with a conventional centre - forward in any game , only hailing for the poacher @entity145 when behind against @entity146			2
@entity147 , the @entity148 forward with a better international striking ratio than @entity30 and @entity101 , did not start a match in @entity29 for @entity151			1
there have been some impressive showings , with @entity138 outstanding for @entity56 in his first two games , before rather tailing off in the knockout round against @entity151			0
@entity156 has scored three for @entity38 , netting two against @entity158 and one against @entity159 , but must now produce in the knock - out rounds			0
students of modern coaching , however , would argue that @entity163 and @entity156 are ‘ nine - and - a - halves ’ , to borrow a phrase from @entity166			0
speaking with @entity168 this time last year , @entity167 diagnosed the ‘ number 9 ’ malaise as an issue for @entity174 football			2
‘ everyone wants to play a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , with just the one striker , ’ @entity167 explained , ‘ we had so many talented @entity174 strikers in the @entity180 , with @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 but they were mostly playing in partnerships , too			0
changing of the guard ? traditional centre forwards like @entity181 are disappearing from the game @entity191 : out and out scorers like @entity186 are becoming less common as time goes by ‘ now , there is the no 9 and the @entity196			1
the 10 plays behind the nine so they are never really playing as a genuine partnership			0
that might have hindered the number of forwards coming through			1
you can only play the one so youngsters may be thinking of playing somewhere else because there is just the one striking position up for grabs			0
that may have something to do with it			0
i have played in the lone striker role and my game was not really suited to that			0
if i were playing now , i would try to play in the no 10 position			0
’ in october , @entity213 then went one step further , arguing that this is a continental - wide epidemic in @entity216			2
the @entity221 manager , explaining why his pursuit of attacking reinforcements had proved so troublesome , said : ‘ @entity216 still produces fantastic football players but if you look closely , we do not produce top strikers anymore			2
all the big strikers now come from @entity229			0
during the summer , @entity230 went to @entity231 , @entity218 went to @entity219 , everybody wanted to sign @entity232 and @entity111 went to @entity114 for big money			2
scarce : @entity221 manager @entity213 believes there are a dearth of centre forwards in @entity216 ‘ that ’s an area where in @entity216 it is difficult to find great strikers			1
even in @entity58 , where i can remember so many great strikers from years gone by , they are producing many exceptional players but not young strikers			0
is that a consequence of the way we coach ? of modern life ? i do not know			0
’ the feeling from this @entity23 in @entity29 suggests that @entity213 was well - reasoned but perhaps he underestimated the debate , for this is an issue that will engulf youth coaches worldwide in the years to come .			1

@entity29 has been *dominated* by number 10s @entity30 , @entity28 and @entity32
traditional number 9s have struggled to make an impact at @entity23
@entity259 @entity97 and @entity260 @entity111 have been poor
number 10s make up five of the top six scorers in the *tournament*
@entity213 has argued that centre forwards are disappearing
