@entity1 ’s worst mass poisoning of modern times may have left six children from one family with lifelong disabilities			1
the @entity7 family live near @entity8 , @entity9 , where a huge quantity of aluminium sulphate poisoned the water supply 26 years ago			1
and of the seven children in the family , six have disabilities			1
plight : the @entity7 children ( top row left - right ) @entity17 , two , @entity19 , 10 , @entity20 , 11 , holding baby @entity21 , 12 weeks , and @entity22 , six			1
front row ( left - right ) @entity23 , four , and @entity26 , eight last month , a mail on sunday special report revealed that three deaths have been linked to the incident			2
and now , @entity31 , a professor in bioinorganic chemistry at @entity33 , who has investigated the deaths , has been contacted by @entity35 and her husband @entity36 who believe their family has been blighted by the poisoning			2
the incident happened in july 1988 when a relief tanker driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate – a chemical used to keep drinking water clear – directly into the water supply instead of into a storage tank at @entity8 ’s @entity47 water treatment works			1
as a ten - year - old , @entity35 unwittingly drank the heavily contaminated water			1
@entity31 , a professor in bioinorganic chemistry at @entity33 , is investigating the deaths the eldest of the couple ’s children , @entity54 , 11 , was born 15 years after the event			2
the youngest affected child , @entity17 , is two			0
for years the couple have struggled to understand why their children – two of whom use wheelchairs – have problems including delayed development , anxiety issues , speech problems and possible autism			2
in 2012 , a blood test found that mrs @entity35 had aluminium levels in her blood 20 times higher than normal			2
professor @entity31 said : ‘ could that impact on her children ? it could			0
studies in animals show that if you feed mothers aluminium in the water supply , the offspring will exhibit developmental problems			1
’ he fears hundreds of children born since 1988 to the 20,000 people estimated to have drunk the contaminated water could also be at risk			1
he said : ‘ everybody wants to know if there are people who were affected at the time who still have higher than normal levels of aluminium in their bodies			0
' if they have had children since then , there ’s a chance those children have been affected as well			0
’ mrs @entity35 , 36 , has not visited @entity8 since 1998 – even though she lives just a short drive away in @entity100			0
she said : ‘ i have nothing against the people , but it holds so many unhappy memories for me			0
’ six of her children – @entity54 , 11 ; @entity19 , ten ; @entity26 , eight ; @entity22 , six ; @entity23 , four ; and @entity17 , two – have a condition called @entity105 ( @entity105 )			0
a relief tanker driver in @entity8 ( pictured ) accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate - used to keep drinking water clear - into the water supply instead of a storage tank at @entity47 waterworks in 1988 the type they have means their joints bend too much and can dislocate with ease			1
they also suffer fatigue and joint pain			0
the couple ’s youngest child , @entity120 , who was born in february , is too young to be assessed			0
mrs @entity35 said they were speaking out so others did not ‘ suffer in silence ’			0
prof @entity31 said : ‘ if you look at these cases , it starts to look like @entity8 has produced a number of incredible one - offs			0
‘ the situation with the @entity7 family fits that pattern quite well			1
