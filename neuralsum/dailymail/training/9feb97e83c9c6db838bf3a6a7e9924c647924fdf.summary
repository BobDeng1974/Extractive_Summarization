a @entity1 production company is waging battle against the upcoming @entity4 movie adaption by releasing its own rival romance flick , @entity6 , in theaters on the same day , next @entity8			1
' a former frat boy and a free - spirited woman together attempt the impossible : an " old - fashioned " courtship in contemporary @entity12 , ' reads the film 's description on @entity15 ; and it looks set to be the very antithesis of all that @entity4 stands for ; sex , bondage , and domination			1
' i wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of godly romance seriously , ' said @entity24 , writer , director and lead actor of the film , before squeezing in an apt biblical reference : ' opening the same weekend as @entity4 , there ’s definitely a @entity30 v. @entity32 comparison			1
' challengers : the @entity1 movie centers around ' a former frat boy ( left ) and a free - spirited woman ( right ) who together attempt the impossible , an " old - fashioned " courtship in contemporary @entity12 ' to the contrary : @entity4 tells the erotic story of @entity4 , a college student played by @entity41 ( pictured ) who is seduced by @entity43 expert @entity4 ' we know we ’re picking a fight here and that we ’re more than a little outgunned , ' mr @entity24 writes on the movie 's blog page			1
' oh well , it is what it is			1
' the actor - director will star opposite @entity53 , an actress who has played the character of @entity55 in @entity56 , and this year , had a minor role in @entity58			2
although mr @entity24 clearly seeks to appeal to die - hard @entity1 with his conservative tale , there seems to be room too for those who have perhaps swayed off the path of godly righteousness			2
' [ the story ] , without apology , explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships ; yet , is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and does n’t seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes , ' he explains coming soon : ' i wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of godly romance seriously , ' says @entity24 ( right ) , the writer , director , and lead actor in the film , also starring @entity53 ( left ) going to head - to - head with the multimillion dollar blockbuster that is @entity4 - which sees @entity41 play the role of @entity4 and hunky @entity88 model @entity87 play @entity4 - mr @entity24 is comfortable being the underdog			2
' we ’re hopeful that there are others out there who desire more from love - and the movies - than objectification or domination ' ' they will have more screens , more money , more hype , ' he correctly identifies			0
' but we ’re hopeful that we are not alone in our belief that there are others out there who desire more from love - and the movies - than objectification or domination			0
' the film is backed by @entity1 film finance firm @entity110 and distributed by @entity111 , reports @entity112 , and , according to co-president @entity113 will be : ' the first faith - based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved @entity1 singles audience			0
' steamy : @entity4 's character in @entity4 is played by former @entity88 model @entity87 ( pictured ) big budget : ' they will have more screens , more money , more hype , ' mr @entity24 notes of his movie nemesis , pictured , a scene starring @entity127 as @entity128 rivals : while the @entity4 trailer ( pictured ) is so far the most - watched movie preview of 2014 , @entity6 hopes to succeed in its mission as ' the first faith - based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved christian singles audience ' the same team also partnered on another faith - based movie which hit theaters in march , entitled @entity138 , which sees a devout @entity1 college freshman battle it out with his aggressively atheist philosophy professor in a quest to prove the existence of @entity144			1
@entity138 was a roaring success and took more than $ 60million at box offices worldwide ; made on a budget of only $ 2million			0
leading film critics unanimously panned the movie however , labeling it ' sick , ' ' ham - fisted , ' ' angry , ' and ' dismal			0
' even if @entity6 does prove as lucrative as @entity138 , its unlikely to touch its nemesis			0
the @entity4 trailer has already been watched on @entity152 over 19 million times so far , making it the most - watched film preview of 2014 .			0

both films will hit theaters next @entity8
