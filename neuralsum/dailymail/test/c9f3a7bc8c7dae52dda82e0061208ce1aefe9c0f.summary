@entity0 has admitted @entity1 ' have a lot of work to do ' to secure an unprecedented third consecutive @entity5 title , despite reaching the @entity7 semi-finals			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 admitted @entity9 's men were distinctly underwhelmed by their performance levels in sunday 's 32 - 18 quarter - final victory over @entity12			1
the @entity14 outfit had @entity16 's unerring boot and @entity18 ' late try to thank for a victory littered with error and inaccuracy			1
@entity22 is tackled by @entity18 during the @entity24 quarter final match @entity1 will host @entity25 at @entity27 's @entity26 on sunday , april 19 in the last four , with @entity0 conceding vast improvements are required to lift the inaugural @entity7			1
' if we want to be in @entity30 for the final we 've got a lot of work to do , ' said @entity0			0
' if we 're honest with ourselves that was nowhere near what we expect against @entity12 , and we 're going to have to make big improvements quickly			1
@entity37 passes the ball during the @entity24 quarter final match ' it 's great to get through of course , and winning is what counts ultimately , but there were far too many mistakes			2
' @entity1 won back - to - back @entity5 crowns to signal the end of the @entity49 era , and president @entity51 's expensively - assembled cast of stars are out to make continental history this term			1
no side has ever won three @entity5 titles on the trot , though @entity58 and @entity59 have also previously registered back - to - back triumphs			0
@entity18 celebrates a try with his @entity1 teammate @entity62 at the @entity63 in sunday 's unstructured and sloppy attempts at swashbuckling , @entity1 clearly craved the hard - nosed and direct influence of a certain @entity67			1
@entity71 's @entity70 - winner 's summer retirement leaves a clear void at @entity73 , especially when @entity74 is missing through injury			0
the former @entity77 pivot returned via the bench at the weekend , leaving @entity16 to lead an at times befuddled line			2
@entity18 dives over to score a last minute try during the quarter final match between @entity1 and @entity12 @entity83 tighthead @entity0 believes @entity74 's return to fitness will offer a timely extra level of focus to @entity1 's approach			1
@entity0 is set to retire at the end of the season , with the 35 - year - old currently completing coaching courses in @entity92 with a view to launching an off - field career in @entity5			2
the 45 - cap @entity83 admitted : ' i wo n't burn my boots ' at the end of the season however - keeping himself available in the autumn just in case @entity83 suffer a front - row injury crisis at the @entity70 in @entity71			0
@entity101 is tackled by @entity102 during the match between @entity1 and @entity12 at @entity63 @entity62 is tackled by @entity104 and @entity105 during the game at the @entity63 ' we always try to look for width on the ball and balance that with our power game , so we 'll look to continue that , but we 've got to make better decisions on the field , ' said @entity0			1
' little mistakes , penalties at the scrum , they cost us , and that hurt us			0
' take those out of the game and we 're in a far better position at half - time			0
' it 's great to have @entity74 coming back : having guys of that experience to come back into the 10 - 12 area is going to be invaluable			0
@entity74 breaks with the ball but is tackled by @entity128 at the @entity63 ' @entity16 played well but you ca n't underestimate what a difference it makes to have another guy in there to organise the team and give us another voice on the field			2
' having him back especially is going to make a big difference for us			0
' obviously it would be fantastic to go out on a high , @entity67 ( @entity142 ) was able to do that last year when we won the double and he fully deserved it			0
' but like i said , there 's a fair bit of work in front of us before we start thinking too much about any of that			0
