the @entity0 and prince @entity1 were greeted by excited workmen today as they arrived at @entity3 to take a train to @entity5 for their annual @entity7 stay			1
their well - wishers - a group of construction workers - snapped away with their camera phones as the couple stepped out of their car			1
in keeping with tradition , the @entity14 couple then boarded a train to @entity18 station in @entity19 on a 90 - minute journey to the private estate where they will enjoy the festivities surrounded by family			1
@entity0 , left , and the @entity1 , right , arrive at @entity26 train station today to take a train to @entity18 for their annual @entity7 break at @entity5 say cheese ! builders currently working on the re-development of @entity3 take out their camera phones to take a snap of the @entity0 on her journey from the station it is a 30 - minute journey to @entity5 - just enough time to dip into a novel			1
and hence why , perhaps , the @entity1 , 91 , was carrying a copy of the book ' @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 ' , by @entity44			2
and the @entity0 was spotted doing her paperwork as she travelled by the public train			1
the @entity1 departs carrying a copy of the book ' @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 ' by @entity44 she surprised other passengers by travelling first class on the 10.45am @entity52 service from the station			1
they discreetly joined more than 50 other unsuspecting people on the train			0
the scheduled service , which had no buffet car or refreshments trolley , went via @entity59 and arrived six minutes late at 12.26pm in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the @entity0 was seen getting into the festive spirit as she sat in front of an open briefcase , reading a white card with the word ' celebrating ' on the front - possibly the menu for the royal family 's @entity67 dinner			1
when she arrived at @entity18 she was then driven to the estate , where she will soon be joined by her close family for @entity7			1
the @entity0 who was wearing a red and white patterned coat adjusted her trademark headscarf to protect her form the wind and rain as she walked along the platform			2
she was also holding a bunch of flowers			0
the train is a far cry from the luxury the @entity0 is used to on the royal train			2
that comes complete with sleeping car , bathroom and a thickly - carpeted saloon and has as many as nine private carriages			2
but due to the huge running costs the train is now only used on very special occasions			0
leaving the train she was followed by four aides carrying bags and the @entity1 with his @entity42 book in his hand			1
the couple then went through a side gate into a car park where a @entity100 was waiting to drive them seven miles to the 20,000 - acre @entity5 estate			1
@entity103 is thought to have booked all dozen seats in the rear first class compartment of the train to ensure that the pair could sit undisturbed with their staff			0
one way first class tickets on the train cost £ 50 each for the 100 mile journey , although it would have been £ 33 if the @entity0 had used a senior railcard			1
security at the station was stepped up for the @entity0 's arrival			1
wrapped up warm and clutching her black handbag , @entity0 looks happy as she is set to depart @entity119 for the @entity7 holiday protection officers carry the couple 's briefcases & blankets as the pair walk to the train for their holiday one passenger said : ' it is amazing to think that we shared a train with the @entity0			1
i had no idea that she and @entity1 were on board until the train stopped			2
' a @entity52 spokesman said he was unable to comment on the royal couple being on the train			2
in previous years , the train company insisted that it never gave the @entity0 any special treatment			2
the @entity0 and prince @entity1 will be joined by other members of the royal family later in the week and will make a public appearance when they attend church on christmas day			1
but @entity5 is expected to be quieter this year without the presence of @entity147 who is on active service in @entity150			2
it was originally thought that @entity152 and @entity153 would not be attending @entity5 this @entity7 and will instead spend it at the @entity156 's house but their plans are not yet clear			1
the @entity0 and prince @entity1 will stay on the estate until the end of january			1
last year @entity152 spent her first @entity7 at the @entity162 house , surrounded by another 28 royals			2
every year there is a festive ritual that is always adhered to by family and visitors			0
the @entity7 message is to be screened in @entity170 and @entity171 for the first time , it was announced today			1
the traditional broadcast will go hi - tech to allow viewers to scrutinise the @entity0 as never before in her @entity176 year			1
however , viewers will also be able to see the 86 - year - old monarch in normal definition during the speech , which will be broadcast at 3pm on christmas day			0
the theme of this year 's message is not known but it is likely to feature the key highlights from 2012 - the @entity185 and the @entity176			1
the @entity0 has watched her @entity187 message , produced this year by @entity188 , and enjoyed the experience			1
a @entity103 spokeswoman said the monarch thought the broadcast was ' absolutely lovely '			0
she added : ' we wanted to do something a bit different and special in this jubilee year , so doing it for the first time in @entity170 seemed a good thing , technology wise , to do			1
' @entity0 absolutely agreed straight away there was no need for convincing at all , she was absolutely ready to embrace something new in this year			2
' first , guests are told what time they should arrive at @entity5 - usually on december 23rd			2
it is most junior royals first , most senior last — and are expected to be prompt			0
by early afternoon , however , everyone is expected to be in attendance			0
they will be ushered to their rooms , furnished in the post-war spartan style the @entity0 and her consort still fondly cling to — two - bar electric fires and blankets ( no duvets )			2
at 4pm , all having changed into suitable outfits for tea , the family gathers in the @entity221 , where the @entity0 encourages the young royals to help put the finishing touches to the christmas tree — a @entity19 spruce taken from the 1,000 - acre estate			1
over home - baked scones and @entity220 , the @entity227 usually gives each member a timetable and room - plan so they know where to marshal themselves and when over the weekend			0
trestle tables are laid out in the nearby @entity236 , with sections marked off with tape showing where each family member ’s gifts should be placed — and , again , naturally laid out in order of precedence			0
presents exchanged , they will all move through to the hall for drinks — martinis mixed by a servant are popular			0
then it ’s back to their rooms , for baths and a second change of clothes			0
for dinner , the men are usually dressed in black tie , the women in evening gowns and jewels			0
after a gong at 8pm for pre-dinner drinks , the family will sit down to a candlelit , three - course dinner at 8.15pm			0
@entity0 , pictured arriving at the station , will take a 30 - minute journey from @entity19 to the private estate afterwards , at around 10pm , the women move to another room for coffee , while the men are offered liquers			1
the @entity0 normally does n’t go to bed until midnight , and no one may leave the party until her majesty @entity275 starts with a full @entity277 breakfast , before the annual outing to @entity5 parish church at 11am			2
@entity0 and prince @entity1 get off the train at 12.26 at @entity282 station this afternoon the public train the royal couple have decided to travel on today first class the @entity0 clutches a bunch of flowers and is wrapped up warm in a head scarf as she gets off the train on their way , with the @entity0 taking the lead , the couple walk across the platform before taking a 30 - minute journey to their private estate back at the big house , preparations will be under way for the traditional @entity7 lunch — @entity19 turkey , accompanied by a selection of cold meats and an array of side dishes on silver salvers			1
the @entity0 is in charge of the seating plan			0
unseen by guests , however , lunch at @entity5 is a drawn - out affair — with junior staff eating at 11am , senior staff an hour later , the royals at 1.15pm and the junior kitchen staff at 2.15pm			2
then everything comes to a halt so all can watch the @entity0 ’s speech on tv at 3pm			0
that afternoon , the royals may go for a walk with the dogs , perhaps play charades or watch tv			0
the book by @entity44 that the @entity1 was carrying is pictured prince @entity1 kept himself amused on the train journey with the @entity0 today - by reading a book about savage barbarian @entity42			1
