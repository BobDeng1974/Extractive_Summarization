for decades , researchers have been trying in vain to decipher ancient texts written on the @entity3 - yet they may have been looking for inspiration in the wrong place			1
a @entity7 botanist studied illustrations of the plants throughout the 15th century book and pinpointed a number of them to the region now known as @entity14			1
dr. @entity15 claims at least 37 of the 303 plants would have grown in the region during the 15th and 16th century and believes the text is , therefore , written in the @entity19 language of @entity20			1
@entity21 , professor of @entity22 at the @entity23 , say he has decoded words in it for the first time by identifying the plants @entity20 originated during the 7th century			2
it was the spoken predominantly by the @entity19			0
following the @entity31 conquest of @entity14 in the 16th century , the alphabet was replaced with @entity32			0
@entity20 became a literary language , used in poetry and passages , similar to the @entity37 manuscript			2
varieties of @entity20 are still spoken by approximately 1.5 million @entity40 people in @entity14			2
the writing is so bizarre , sceptics have stated the book is a hoax or that the writing is nonsense			0
the voynich manuscript was discovered in an @entity49 monastery in 1912 by book dealer @entity37			1
carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created between approximately 1404 and 1438 , during the @entity53			0
the 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin , known as vellum , and are decorated with illustrations , diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right			1
examples include the illustration of the @entity65 , top left , taken from the @entity67 which has an identical style to the @entity69 in the manuscript , bottom left			0
a @entity37 illustration of a cactus pad or fruit , right , is shown near the name ‘ nashtli ’ , which dr. @entity15 and @entity78 claim is a variant of the word ‘ nochtil ’ - the @entity20 name for the fruit of the prickly pear if the text , pictured far left , is written in the language of @entity20 , the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript			1
from this , cryptographers may be able to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text in the 15th century book the @entity3 manuscript , pictured , was discovered in an @entity49 monastery in 1912 by book dealer @entity37			1
carbon dating suggests it was created between 1404 and 1438			0
the 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin , known as vellum due to its mysterious nature , the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world , yet no - one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages			1
dr. @entity15 from @entity113 took a different approach , and instead , studied the plants depicted throughout the book			0
he discovered similarities between specific plants in the manuscript and illustrations of plants he had spotted in his collection of 16th century @entity125 records			2
the voynich manuscript was discovered in an @entity49 monastery in 1912 by book dealer @entity37			1
carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created in the early 15th century , between approximately 1404 and 1438 , during the @entity53			0
the 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin , known as vellum			0
each page is decorated with illustrations , diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right			1
due to its mysterious nature , the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world , yet no - one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages			1
this has led to many people claim the book is hoax , or that the writing is nonsense			0
due to the manuscript ’s discovery in @entity49 , many researchers believe the book to have originated in @entity154 , however , the latest research from dr. @entity15 suggests it may have been written by the @entity19 in what is now modern - day @entity14			1
for example , dr. @entity15 and fellow researcher @entity78 said one plant in the book bears a resemblance to the picture of a soap plant ( xiuhamolli ) seen in a @entity125 codex from 1552			0
while another example includes the illustration of the @entity65 , taken from the @entity67 , which has an identical style to the @entity69 in the manuscript			0
in total , the researchers linked 37 of the 303 plants in the manuscript to illustrations in ancient @entity125 books covering botany across @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			0
due to its mysterious nature , the text and diagrams in the manuscript , pictured , have been studied by cryptographers around the world , yet no - one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages			1
this has led to many people claim the book is hoax , or that the writing is nonsense @entity20 , pictured here written in the @entity192 , originated in @entity14 during the 7th century			1
it was spoken predominantly by the @entity19 if the text is written in the language of @entity20 , the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript and may be able to use these to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text			1
for example , a @entity37 illustration of a cactus pad or fruit is shown near the name ‘ nashtli ’ , which @entity15 and @entity78 claim is a variant of the word ‘ nochtil ’ - the nahuatl name for the fruit of the prickly pear			0
