the athletes , coaches and organisers who brought delight to the nation this summer dominate the list like no other group before them			1
a staggering 127 awards have been handed out to those involved – more than 10 per cent of the total			0
the figure is unprecedented in the 122 - year history of the list			2
among the 78 athletes and coaches honoured were cyclist @entity2 and sailor @entity30 , who both received knighthoods			1
sir @entity2 , as he will be known , made sporting history this year by becoming the first @entity33 to win the @entity5 , and followed the feat by scooping an @entity10 gold , as well as being crowned @entity36			1
he heads a sparkling list of sporting heroes , including @entity40 cyclist @entity39 , who was made a dame , and @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , who all received cbes			1
@entity47 , affectionately known as @entity2 , said : ‘ it ’s quite something really			2
i never imagined that i would ever become a knight , so it ’s an incredible honour , but there ’s a slight element of disbelief , and it will take a while to sink in			1
there was never any doubt whether i ’d accept it or not , it was more a case that i never saw myself as a sir , and i probably never will			0
’ the honours crown a year of excellence in @entity3 sport – so much so that a special honours list was added to recognise the 65 medals , 29 of them gold , won at this year ’s @entity10 , as well as the 120 medals – including 34 golds – won at the @entity40			1
there was also recognition for those behind the @entity40			0

i never imagined that i would ever become a knight ' but eyebrows were raised that @entity44 received only a @entity93 for his historic double track triumph in the 5000m and 10000m			2
in 2005 , @entity96 was made a dame for winning both the 400m and 800m at the @entity99			2
heptathlete gold medallist and @entity101 poster girl @entity42 will also have to be content with a cbe			2
@entity102 , who won @entity10 tennis gold before becoming @entity3 ’s first men ’s @entity105 champion for 76 years , can perhaps count himself unlucky to receive just an obe			1
it was also noted that while @entity39 was made a dame after her four golds at 2012 , her @entity40 teammate , wheelchair athlete @entity45 , who also got four golds , was made merely a cbe			1

champion : @entity30 , who won four successive @entity10 sailing golds , has received a knighthood in the list @entity126 : @entity39 is the @entity3 's most successful ever paralympian and is to be made a dame there was also nothing for cyclist @entity130 , who with six gold medals became @entity3 ’s most successful ever @entity132 during the @entity40 , because he had already been knighted after his heroics at the previous @entity101 in @entity134			1
