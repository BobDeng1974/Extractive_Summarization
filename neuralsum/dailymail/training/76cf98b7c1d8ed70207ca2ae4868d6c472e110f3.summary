malaria that is completely resistant to drug treatment could soon spread into @entity3 putting millions of lives at risk , scientists have warned			1
experts have discovered a strain of the parasite in @entity9 that is totally resistant to the antimalarial drug artemisinin , which they have described as an ' enormous threat '			1
worryingly , the resistant parasites have been found just 15 miles from the country 's border with @entity3 in an ' alarming development '			1
danger : malaria is spread by mosquitoes and scientists say the resistant parasites found in the @entity23 region of @entity9 , just 15 miles from @entity3 , in an ' alarming development ' if the spread of artemisinin - resistant malaria parasites were to reach into @entity3 , that would pose a serious threat to the chances of global control of the killer disease			1
@entity32 , director of the @entity33 , said : ' the pace at which artemisinin resistance is spreading or emerging is alarming			0
' ' we need a more vigorous international effort to address this issue in border regions			0
' in a study published in @entity43 journal , experts collected 940 parasite samples at 55 malaria treatment centres across @entity9 - also known as @entity9 - and its border regions			2
similar strains have also been detected in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
they found that almost 40 percent of the samples had mutations in their so - called kelch gene , @entity55 -- a known genetic signal of artemisinin drug resistance			0
@entity58 of the @entity60 tropical medicine research unit led the study at @entity62 , said : ' @entity9 is considered the front line in the battle against artemisinin resistance as it forms a gateway for resistance to spread to the rest of the world			2
' if resistance spreads from @entity72 to @entity73 , or emerges in @entity73 independently , ' millions of lives will be at risk ' , the report said			0
deaths from malaria have nearly halved since 2000 , and the infection now kills an estimated 600,000 people each year - most of them children in the poorest parts of @entity73			1
fatal : malaria kills an estimated 600,000 people each year - most of them children in the poorest parts of @entity73 @entity58 noted that thanks to advances in the science of genetic analysis , researchers tracking artemisinin antimalarials are in ' the unusual position of having molecular markers for resistance before resistance has spread globally '			1
he added : ' the more we understand about the current situation ... the better prepared we are to adapt and implement strategies to overcome the spread of further drug resistance			0
' from the late 1950s to the 1970s , chloroquine - resistant malaria spread across @entity72 to @entity73 , leading to a resurgence of cases and millions of deaths			2
@entity103 was replaced by sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine ( @entity104 ) , but resistance to @entity104 subsequently emerged in western @entity48 and again spread to @entity73			0
@entity104 was replaced by artemisinin combination treatment , or @entity107 , and experts now worry that history may repeat itself yet again .			2

scientists discover strain of parasite that is totally resistant to treatment
it has now been located just 15 miles from @entity9 's border with @entity3
experts say it is an ' alarming ' development and an ' enormous threat '
malaria kills an estimated 600,000 people around the world every year
