by @entity0 a drunken @entity2 sea captain twice crashed his 3,000 tonne ship at a busy @entity5 port before asking police if he could ' have another go ? ' @entity7 , 44 , hit the @entity9 port lock gates once manoeuvring the @entity10 having downed a bottle of vodka			1
he ignored warnings and was described as ' all over the place ' as he managed to do it a second time			2
@entity7 was more than four - times over the drink drive limit			1
he had 157 milligrams of alcohol in blood when the legal limit is 35			2
when he was quizzed by police about his mayhem he drunkenly replied : ' can i have another go ? ' @entity34 of @entity35 , @entity2 , pleaded guilty to a charge of being over the prescribed alcohol limit for a ship ’s master at @entity40			1
@entity41 , mitigating , said @entity7 had been drinking 12 hours before the september 12 incident , because he thought he did n't have to sail until later			1
but his departure time was unexpectedly brought forward to just after midday			2
a @entity9 - dock boat handler spotted @entity7 as he tried to manoeuvre the ship , and became worried when he noticed the captain 's eyes were glazed and he smelled of booze			1
busy port : the captain crashed his 326ft vessel at the busy @entity9 port			2
( @entity54 picture ) he admitted he had drunk a bottle of vodka before taking the helm but later changed it to five or six pints			1
judge @entity61 told the @entity2 : ' it is outrageous to be in charge of a great big vessel like this while over the drink limit			2
' @entity68 , prosecuting , said @entity7 was being assisted but did not want to know			1
' it was a tight fit , ' mr @entity68 said			0
' the captain 's eyes were glazed			1
he was described as being ' all over the place '			0
' ( a boat handler ) tried to assist			0
but @entity7 would not let him			1
eventually the ship was towed into position			0
' the court heard it was not unusual for ships to hit the lock gates , but it was rare to ram them with such brute force			1
mr @entity41 said ship 's captains were seldom put behind bars for collisions , unless lives were put at risk			0
tight fit : maneuvering the ship into the gates is a task that requires the full attention of the operator , as this aerial view of @entity9 shows he said a skipper who had been drinking had grounded a ship at @entity100 and another drunken captain had crashed in to a rig off the @entity104 coast , had both been sentenced to 12 months jail because the crashes resulted in sea rescues			1
but he said the crew in @entity9 was not put in such danger			0
' he has lost his master ’s certificate and has a wife and two children , ' mr @entity41 said			0
' the ship 's agents have washed their hands of him			0
he has remained in @entity9 staying in a hotel awaiting his fate			0
' he added that @entity7 's family had £ 5,000 and they could wire to the @entity5 if the court was thinking of a fine			2
judge @entity61 said : ' my instinct is a custodial sentence , but not a long one			0
i do n’t want him thinking he can buy his way out of this			0
' @entity128 was remanded in custody until sentencing next week			0
