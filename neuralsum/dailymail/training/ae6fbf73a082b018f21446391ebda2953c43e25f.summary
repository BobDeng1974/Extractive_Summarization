all those tournament victories and great days at the majors , all those fabulous rounds he ’s played over the years when he seemingly had the ball on the end of a string			0
never once , though , since turning professional in 2007 had @entity7 enjoyed the satisfaction of a hole in one			1
he threw his arms into the air , like a joyous footballer , after his nine - iron shot to the 177 - yard , par - three 15th bounced twice before dropping gently into the hole for his first ace in competition			1
scroll down to watch video of @entity7 's @entity20 @entity7 hits his tee shot on the 15th hole at @entity23 on friday morning - and it would yield spectacular results @entity7 celebrates after making a hole - in - one as his @entity27 playing partner @entity26 ( left ) looks on the two young guns of golf exchange a high five in celebration of @entity7 's superb shot @entity33 ( third left ) gets a handshake from @entity7 after helping him select the right club for the shot 23 under par rounds 96 under par in total 19 rounds in the 60s 104 birdies 27 bogeys 1 hole - in - one after missing easy birdie putts at the previous two holes , @entity7 said : ‘ it certainly made up for those misses			1
i knew it had a chance when i saw where it landed , and it took a nice hop to the right and dropped in			0
my first ace as a pro , so obviously the beers are on me tonight			1
’ @entity7 had his first hole in one aged nine , also with a nine iron , although back then it travelled 106 yards			1
he ’d had eight since but only with his mates and , once , in a pro-am			0
perhaps it is surprising he ’s had to wait so long for an ace in competition , but @entity7 knows some great players never achieve one			2
the late @entity66 , for example			0
‘ obviously there ’s some skill involved but there ’s also a lot of luck , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ when you look at some of the players who have never had one , it was nice to get one out here			0
’ the perfect shot formed part of a back - nine charge that has left the @entity23 @entity81 with the sort of leaderboard that reads like an answered prayer for the sponsor			1
course specialist @entity86 , three times a winner round here , is in pole position to win again after following his opening 64 with a 67			2
when he finished around lunchtime he was five clear and the tournament had the feel of a procession			0
@entity7 starts his swing for his tee shot at the 15th hole at the @entity23 during friday 's second round the @entity99 looks to have made good contact as he completes his swing @entity7 and the crowd eye the flight of his ball as it flies towards the pin on the 15th green the ball can be seen just before it lands on the green , directly in line with the flagstick @entity7 's ball pitches just a few feet away from the flag as the excitement starts to build among the crowd the ball rolls straight towards the cup with @entity7 having judged his shot and club selection to perfection going , going , gone ! @entity7 's ball drops into the cup for the first hole - in - one of his career @entity7 beams with delight and the spectators roar their appreciation after the ball drops for a hole - in - one @entity7 salutes the crowd as he makes his way to the green to pick his ball out of the hole @entity7 changed all that , as did the gifted young @entity135 @entity134			1
indeed , but for a bogey on his final hole , the big - hitting 22 - year - old from @entity137 would have finished on the same mark as @entity86			1
his @entity142 coach @entity141 reckons he will be among the world ’s best in a couple of years and what an experience awaits him over the final two rounds			0
not only @entity86 for company , but @entity7 is just two off the lead after a marvellous back nine completed in 31 shots			1
if his opening 67 was achieved with a little smoke and mirrors , this 66 was more like the real @entity7			2
his ball - striking was back to its prodigious best and he bludgeoned poor @entity26 into submission , for instance , as the @entity27 tumbled to a 75			1
‘ i ’m not sure i could find any fault with my game from tee to green , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ i even hit a lot of good putts but they did n’t go in			0
but i ’m in a great position and you could hardly ask for anything better for your first tournament of the year than chasing a two - time major champion on a course he loves			1
it will be hard to catch @entity86 round here , but i will be giving it my best			2

a tussle between the two men who have won the last three majors , then			0
it ’s hard to beat that , is n’t it ? meanwhile , on the @entity210 at the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity209 shot a first - round 62 and then revealed he has resigned from the @entity213 after 17 years as a member , thus making him ineligible to play in the @entity215			0
@entity209 , 37 , who became a father last year , said : ‘ for as long as i have been a professional i have been a member of the @entity213 , so it was a very tough decision			0
