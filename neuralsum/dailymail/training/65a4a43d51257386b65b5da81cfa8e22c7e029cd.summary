@entity2 ebola response coordinator @entity0 will not appear before the @entity3 on wednesday when it convenes a hearing on the federal government 's response to the deadly viral outbreak			1
the seldom - seen @entity0 , known in @entity8 as president @entity10 's ' ebola czar , ' has already skipped one @entity12 - related hearing in the @entity13 , held two days after he officially started on the job			1
the high - profile november 12 @entity3 hearing would be a typical forum for him to answer questions about how the work of various cabinet - level agencies will be integrated together if @entity20 approves @entity10 's latest funding request			1
but instead of risking tough questions during a public hearing , @entity0 privately briefed congressional leaders on friday at the @entity2 and appeared tuesday on the administration - friendly @entity25			1
' today is a milestone , ' @entity0 said			0
' but let ’s be clear ... we ’re going to see occasional additional cases of @entity12 in our country			0
this is not the last one			0
' the @entity2 has asked for $ 6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease , including $ 4.64 billion to meet immediate needs and another $ 1.54 billion ' as a @entity61 to ensure that there are resources available to meet the evolving nature of the epidemic			0
' @entity68 @entity67 sen. @entity66 , the committee 's chairwoman until @entity70 take over the @entity3 in january , emphasized in her hearing announcement the need to attack @entity12 on multiple fronts by deploying resources overseas , stopping @entity12 at the @entity75 border and supporting scientific advances			1
one @entity3 aide to a committee @entity79 told @entity80 on tuesday that @entity0 should appear personally to describe how he is coordinating these efforts for the benefit of lawmakers who were n't in friday 's high - level @entity2 briefing			1
' the whole idea of having an @entity12 czar is turning out to be a big charade if he does n't suit up to play , ' he said			1
' it just feeds this idea that the @entity2 is n't willing to be transparent			2
if @entity0 is drawing a salary from the administration , he should n't be allowed to refuse to answer questions about what he 's doing			1
' the aide spoke on condition of anonymity			0
a @entity2 official told @entity80 that other witnesses who will show up ' will be senior representatives from the departments and agencies executing our @entity12 response both at home and abroad			1
' ' they are well placed to discuss the emergency funding request , ' he said			0
' the official ignored did not respond to a question about what might be on @entity0 's calendar during the 2:00 p.m. hearing on wednesday			2
the administration is sending hhs secretary @entity40 and homeland security secretary @entity43 to @entity113 instead , along with @entity39 director @entity38 , @entity115 director @entity114 , a top @entity116 coordinator and experts from the @entity119 departments			0
four of the eight witnesses will offer opening statements , an @entity3 spokesman told @entity80 , but all of them will be available to answer questions			1
@entity0 wo n't be among them			1
@entity126 ? @entity10 's ' ebola czar ' is n't exactly a rousing success , with 40 per cent of @entity75 saying they 've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he 's doing a good job @entity131 : just 34 per cent of @entity75 say they have faith in president @entity10 to manage the @entity12 crisis the right way moving forward lots to coordinate : @entity0 told @entity25 's @entity138 on tuesday that the @entity75 will see more @entity12 cases the longtime @entity67 operative who served a chief of staff to vice presidents @entity142 and @entity143 , has had a rough start in his role			1
in a @entity80 / @entity147 poll during the last days of october , just 10 per cent of @entity75 said they approved of his job performance			2
that 's a lower number than the dismal ratings of @entity20 itself			0
fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him			0
following the october 24 @entity12 hearing in the @entity156 , chairman rep. @entity153 of @entity154 said it was understandable that @entity0 did n't appear since he was getting up to speed			1
but ' we do not expect that that would be repeated if there ’s a followup hearing , ' he cautioned			0
ebola czar @entity0 wo n't testify in wednesday 's @entity12 hearing , but the @entity2 is sending a cavalcade of other witnesses whose agencies ' epidemic responses he is tasted with ' coordinating ' : @entity40 , @entity169 accompanied by : @entity43 , homeland security secretary @entity170 , @entity171 deputy secretary for management and resources accompanied by : @entity172 , @entity173 assistant secretary for special operations and @entity174 accompanied by : @entity10 attracted criticism in 2009 for appointing 18 ' czars ' to advise him on everything from global warming to guns			1
because none of them has legal authority – ~ their role is limited to advising the @entity2 – they 're not subject to the @entity185 of the @entity75 @entity186			2
that means , unlike cabinet secretaries , they do n't have to withstand the scrutiny of a @entity3 confirmation hearing , and the executive office of the president can shield them from congressional hearings			2
the late @entity195 @entity67 sen. @entity194 complained to the @entity2 a month after @entity10 took office in 2009 , saying that ' the rapid and easy accumulation of power by @entity2 staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances			0
' ' at the worst , ' @entity194 wrote in february 2009 , ' @entity2 staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of @entity3 - confirmed officials			2
… as presidential assistants , they are not accountable to @entity20 , to @entity212 officials and to virtually anyone but the president			0
' on the @entity79 side , @entity216 sen. @entity215 once threatened to hold up funding if @entity2 czars are n't made available for congressional testimony			2
she proposed legislation in september 2009 to do just that			0
it never got off the ground in a @entity3 controlled by @entity67			0
' many of these new " czars , " she said on the @entity3 floor , ' appear to occupy positions of greater responsibility and authority than officials who already have been confirmed by the @entity3			0
' ' the appointments of so many czars have muddied the waters , causing confusion and risking miscommunication going forward , ' @entity231 added			0
' we need to know , with clarity : who is responsible for what ? who is in charge – the czar or the @entity212 official ? who can @entity20 and the @entity75 people hold accountable for government policies that affect daily life ? '			1

senators will convene wednesday to hear cabinet - level agencies ' funding requests for their @entity12 responses but @entity0 wo n't show up
@entity2 refers to @entity0 as its ' ebola response coordinator , ' tasked with *harmonizing* the *sprawling* federal government 's work
one @entity3 aide told @entity80 that ' the whole idea of having an @entity12 czar is turning out to be a big charade if he does n't suit up to play '
@entity2 *insists* other hearing witnesses from the administration will be *adequate* for the hearing
@entity0 wont talk to @entity20 but appeared on @entity25 to warn that there will be more ebola cases in the @entity75
