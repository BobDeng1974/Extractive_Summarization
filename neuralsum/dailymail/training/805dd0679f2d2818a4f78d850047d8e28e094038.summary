@entity0 , a 40 - year - old mother - of - two , won @entity2 bronze in the 5,000m , 17 years after competing in her first major championships			1
it was a gutsy piece of distance running from an @entity7 who simply refused to bow down to the might of @entity11 distance running , or to be limited by the supposed barriers of age			2
‘ @entity14 for me , ’ was former 10,000m world champion @entity16 ’s verdict - and she should know , after all			0
delighted : @entity0 took @entity2 bronze in the 5,000 metres at @entity19 on saturday put your hands up ! @entity11 @entity22 clinched the gold as @entity0 strode home for third @entity22 , 23 , maintained @entity11 ’s record of winning every women ’s distance event in @entity29 with her time of 15mins 7.21secs , but it was @entity0 who produced the most remarkable display to win bronze , just 10 months after giving birth to her second child , @entity37			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it feels a bit surreal real , to be honest			2
i tried to think : “ just do n’t regret this			0
” ‘ it ’s so easy to think : “ oh , they are @entity11 , they are so good			0
” i thought no , keep focusing and just tried to beat them			0
‘ it ’s really special to think my little boy is watching me			0
we debated whether to bring my little girl but i really worried she ’d be terrified as she is only 10 months old			0
‘ it ’s really special to think that i am 40 , a mum with two children			0
’ hard yards ! the 40 - year - old showed a breathtaking turn of pace on the home straight @entity0 was one of two 40 - year - old @entity59 athletes in the field alongside @entity61 , competing in her fifth consecutive @entity2 , who finished 11th			1
the third @entity59 competitor , @entity64 junior cross-country champion @entity63 , who finished eighth , would only have been three years old when @entity0 reached the 1500m semi-finals at the 1997 @entity66 - the same age as @entity0 ’s son @entity68 , who was watching at @entity19 last night			1
his mother spoiled the anticipated @entity11 1 - 2 - 3 by sprinting past @entity71 in the home straight and nearly catching @entity73 , who finished second			1
it was the least @entity0 deserved for pushed on with 1200m remaining as she attempted to run the sting out of the @entity11 trio , and going again at the bell			1
it had looked like a brave fourth place was beckoning when she was passed with 200m to go , but @entity0 gritted her teeth and produced another spurt coming off the final bend to win @entity2 bronze .			2

@entity11 @entity22 *claimed* the gold at @entity19
@entity0 passed @entity71 on the home straight
@entity73 , 19 years @entity0 *'s* junior , finished second
