two years on from his shocking collapse against @entity2 at the @entity3 , and @entity4 is still getting asked about it			1
‘ every time i go to the press room , i know the questions are coming and i feel like we ’re in a morgue , ’ he says			2
never mind that he has career earnings of more than $ 60 million ( £ 37m ) , will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at @entity15 next week and , at 44 , looks up at only six fellow professionals in the world rankings			1
‘ everyone is looking at me with this blank stare and they ask me depressing questions , ’ he added			2
‘ and they bring up the @entity3 the last time , and we go through @entity24 ( he doubled the 18th hole in 2012 to lose the @entity26 ) and i leave there feeling like i lost my dog			1
i do n’t expect anyone to feel sorry for me			2
’ @entity4 , @entity32 and @entity33 watch @entity34 celebrate after winning the @entity3 in 2012 as you might gather , @entity4 in conversation is every bit as straight as one of his drives — and you can understand the slight irritation at the recurring theme			1
he is , after all , the great survivor of world golf , a man defying ridiculous odds			2
it is eight years since he was asked whether the game was passing him by			1
it was a reference to his struggle with his funky swing and being a medium hitter in the era of the power game			2
he ’s certainly answered that one			1
eight years on , just two players finished above him when it came to making this @entity56 team			1
‘ i ’m very proud to represent my country and when i look back on my career and the things i ’ve done , making nine teams means an awful lot , ’ he said			1
‘ you have to be consistent and to be able to qualify by right for eight of them , to be in the mix that often , i ’m proud of that			2
’ the @entity2 question keeps coming up , of course , because of the extra-ordinary circumstances			1
@entity4 was one up with two holes to play against the @entity72 on the final day in @entity73 but bogeyed them both to make his own unfortunate contribution to the miracle of @entity77			1
@entity4 will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at @entity15 next week captain @entity80 had picked him as a wild card and @entity4 was devastated when he did n’t deliver			1
‘ i think if you ask @entity2 he would agree i outplayed him but it does n’t matter if you do n’t win the point , ’ he said			1
‘ i think i was the most disappointed of our team because i felt bad for @entity80			2
he got everything right as captain but quite honestly we laid an egg on sunday and the @entity90 got the momentum			2
’ you might expect him to be leading from the front alongside some of his more excitable colleagues such as @entity95 in declaring this forthcoming visit to @entity97 a mission of redemption			0
but @entity4 has been down that road before , putting pressure on himself , and he knows it does n’t work for him			1
it ’s exactly four years , for example , since he claimed the last of his 16 victories in the 2010 @entity106 in @entity107			2
since then , he has led eight tournaments going into the final round and not once has he ended up with the trophy			0
‘ some of them have been taken away from me by people playing great final rounds but i ’ve got in my own way a few times as well , ’ he conceded			0
@entity4 bristled when @entity117 golf correspondent @entity116 asked him last week if this team was more pumped up than previous @entity56 sides			1
‘ any other clichés you want to throw at me ? ’ he replied			0
‘ are the @entity90 more of a team , and we ’re just individuals , perhaps ? ’ earlier , he had given a more considered response			0
@entity34 's @entity2 of @entity125 smiles as he walks up to the green on the eighteenth hole at @entity77 ‘ if it was the same 12 players against their 12 then yes , it would be a lot of motivation , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity135 lose to the @entity136 3 - 0 then yes , the next time they meet it ’s a big deal			2
but this is going to be a different group of guys and it ’s two years later and also , i do n’t think you ever need motivation to play in the @entity3			1
every team i ’ve played in , the motivation has been the same			0
’ @entity4 still considers it his favourite event , even though he ’s only been on two winning teams			1
‘ three - six would sound an awful lot better than two - seven , would n’t it ? ’ he said , smiling			0
‘ i just love the whole atmosphere			0
i remember losing one match to @entity152 and @entity153 on the final green but i still loved it			2
they hung tough at the end , and you can have no complaints when that happens			0
‘ i like the friendships i ’ve made and the spirit in which the matches are generally played			0
i remember competing against @entity168 and @entity169 in 2006			0
i had a short putt and someone said pick it up and i was n’t quite sure what they said and @entity168 gave me this look that said , “ come on @entity4 , you know better than that , there ’s nothing goofy going to happen in this group ”			1
‘ i ’ve made some good friendships over the years with @entity90 like @entity168 and @entity169			0
but it is true we ’ve been on the losing side rather more than i would have liked			0
’ he has a good relationship with the @entity184 crowd , too , and is looking forward to the @entity90 songs			0
‘ they ’re a great part of the occasion , ’ he said			0
‘ my favourite was at @entity192 when you could n’t see the fairway and the fans started singing , “ follow your nose , @entity4 ”			1
i could barely hit my tee shot i was laughing so hard			0
’ look to @entity4 to be a formidable presence in the two foursomes series and a vital member of the @entity56 team room			1
and he knows exactly what needs to happen to prevent the press room feeling like a morgue			0
‘ i ’m not chastising the press or anything , y’all have been very fair to me over the years , ’ he said			0
‘ i understand the questions			0
i guess i just want to get away from having a sad conversation all the time , and walk out of there feeling happy			0
‘ i guess we have to win , right ? so if and when that happens , i ’ll be the one with a big smile on my face			0

@entity4 will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at @entity15 next week
