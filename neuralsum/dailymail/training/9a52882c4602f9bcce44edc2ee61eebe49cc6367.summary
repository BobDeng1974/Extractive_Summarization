he has already earned himself a record - breaking 16 @entity2 medals and the world will watch as he propels himself through the water for gold in the next few weeks			2
but @entity7 international swimmer @entity6 works hard for the enviably strong physique that has garnered him an army of female fans as well as a closet full of medals			1
the 27 - year - old athlete , whose arms span 6ft 7in ( 201 cm ) — disproportionate to his height of 6ft 4in inches ( 193 cm ) — maintains that his performance is down to his highly calorific diet , which sees him feast on a staggering 12,000 calories every day			1
precarious : do n't drop that towel @entity22			0
in fact , do , please give this man a @entity26 campaign : the swimmer shows off his tan lines poolside focus : the world champion is preparing for the games with a supersized diet water babe : enjoying a training session before the official start of the @entity36 he starts the day with a hearty breakfast consisting of three fried - egg sandwiches , three chocolate chip pancakes , a five - egg omelette , three sugar - coated slices of @entity44 toast , and a bowl of grits ( maize porridge )			1

' personal trainer and nutritionist and weight management expert @entity83 , who has trained athletes , rugby player and celebrities such as @entity90 , maintains that although @entity22 's diet would be dangerous for a regular person , the athlete needs that amount of energy for training			2
' i would recommend that a regular competitive male swimmer would need around 6,000 calories a day but because @entity22 is at @entity2 level he will be training so hard that he will be burning it straight off			2
' his cholesterol intake is very high but by constantly swimming , there is no time for the cholesterol to stick to his arteries			0
but his cholesterol levels do need to be checked regularly to ensure he is not putting his body at risk for future cardiovascular disease			0
' his hard work paid off at the @entity112 where he took home @entity115 gold medal @entity83 says that @entity22 's energy drink consumption is necessary for an athlete in order to keep his electrolytes balanced and his muscles hydrated			0
' @entity121 and electrolyte enhance drinks should be taken to replenish glycogen stores in muscles and liver as dehydration can cause muscles to fatigue very quickly			0
