by @entity1 reporter published : 14:00 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 06:57 est , 5 june 2012 @entity3 's botched @entity2 has drawn yet another lawsuit as angry investors are claiming @entity6 knew his company 's stock price would tank and sold out $ 1.1 billion - worth before shares slumped			1
the class - action says @entity6 , along with other @entity3 executives and the banks behind the ipo , had inside information that the social media giant was over-valued , but did n't tell the public			1
this allowed the stock to open at more than $ 38 a share			0
the price immediately dropped precipitously in the days after the may 18 ipo			0
by monday afternoon , it had fallen 30 percent , to less than $ 27 a share			1
' zucked ' : @entity6 has aroused so much anger about @entity3 's ipo that he has inspired two lawsuits and a new word of disgust -- ' zucked ' analyst firm @entity29 projected @entity3 had to fall another $ 2 , to $ 25 , before the company would reach its true value			1
such is the anger over @entity3 's ipo , the most anticipated in decades , that some critics are claiming it was a ' pump - and - dump ' operation -- where the owners of a stock deliberately inflate the value based on false information and then cash out before the price collapses			2
others have coined a new word to describe their financial state after @entity6 's social media giant went public -- ' zucked			1
' @entity45 reports the new lawsuit , the second in two weeks , names @entity6 , along with @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
as evidence of @entity6 's knowledge , the plaintiffs cite the @entity3 founder 's disclosure filings that lists 30.2 million shares of the company he sold right after the stock went public			1
initial public flop : shares of @entity3 have fallen 30 percent since @entity6 proudly announced the $ 38 ipo of his social media giant the sale , at $ 38 a share , netted him $ 1.13 billion			1
if he sold the shares today , they would be worth $ 800 million			0
other big - time @entity3 investors , who got in on the company before the ipo , raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from dumping off their stock at $ 38 a share			2
the new lawsuit is similar to ones filed within days of the ipo , alleging that top executives knew their stock was going to tank after initial trading			0
those suits say @entity3 warned the banks behind its ipo that the company would fall short of its expected revenue for the second quarter			2
the banks knew this information , even as @entity3 was selling its $ 16 billion stock offering to the public , the plaintiffs allege			2
instead of coming clean with the damaging news , according to the lawsuits banks like @entity49 shared it only with big investors -- allowing them to stay away from the stock until the price dropped to reflect the lower earnings			0
@entity3 has previously strongly denied the allegations			0
@entity49 has said it did nothing during the @entity98 that it would n't have done for any other company 's stock offering .			0

shares of the social media giant have dropped 30 percent to below $ 27
@entity106 says @entity6 's notice he was dumping 30.2 million shares of @entity3 on the first day of the ipo is proof of their claims
previous lawsuit says the banks knew @entity3 revenues would fall short of expectations but only told a few major investors
