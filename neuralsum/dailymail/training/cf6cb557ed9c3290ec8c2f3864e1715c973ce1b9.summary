not content with world domination , @entity1 - based @entity0 is ramping up its efforts to expand its business into the cosmos			1
after purchasing satellite maker @entity7 earlier this week for £ 300 million ( $ 500 million ) , the tech giant is now said to be preparing to buy a stake in sir @entity10 ’s space tourism company @entity9			1
the £ 18 million ( $ 30 million ) deal would give @entity0 access to @entity9 ’s @entity13 , capable of launching satellites into space within a few years			1
@entity0 is apparently in advanced talks with @entity9 to buy a 1.5 per cent stake in the company at £ 18 million ( $ 30 million )			1
this would value the firm at £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2 billion )			2
the deal would give @entity0 access to @entity9 's cargo spacecraft @entity13 , the sibling to the passenger - carrying @entity25 ( pictured ) the deal would give @entity0 a 1.5 per cent stake in @entity29 - based @entity9 , and value the company at £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2 billion ) , reports @entity31			1
in june 2013 @entity0 announced @entity32 , an endeavour to send balloons high into the atmosphere that would provide internet coverage to remote areas			0
then in april this year , @entity0 acquired @entity38 , a drone startup company that makes high - flying robots			2
this was followed in june by the £ 300 million ( $ 500 million ) acquisition of @entity1 satellite maker @entity7 , which will boost the quality of images in @entity46			1
and now the merger with @entity9 will allow @entity0 to start launching its own satellites into space , with the goal of expanding its influence around the world			1
this would allow them to begin launching a fleet of satellites - an apparent goal for the company needed to expand their influence around the world			2
the talks are also expected to have a second outcome , in which @entity0 will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in @entity9 , with a view to building the world ’s first space tourism business			1
@entity13 is perhaps lesser known than the main ship of @entity9 ’s business , @entity25			0
the latter is a passenger - carrying spaceplane that , beginning later this year or early next , will take six paying customers on brief six - minute forays into space			0
to reach beyond the official ‘ line ’ of space ( known the @entity76 line , 62 miles or 100 kilometres up ) @entity25 is carried to an altitude of 50,000 feet ( 15,500 metres ) by the @entity79 mothership before detaching and using its rocket to reach space			0
in the past year @entity0 ( headquarters in @entity1 pictured ) has begun to take giant leaps towards space			1
it began last year with the announcement of a high - altitude balloon project called @entity32			0
in the last two months the tech giant bought a drone company , acquired a satellite firm and is now investing in @entity9 @entity9 is expected to begin commercial flights of its @entity25 vehicle later this year or early next , with flights of its cargo - carrying @entity13 vehicle to begin at a later date			1
pictured is a powered test flight of @entity25 over the @entity98 in @entity1 on 29 april 2013 tickets to ride into space are now valued at £ 150,000 ( $ 250,000 ) with celebrities including @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 apparently already stumping up the money for a ticket			1
crew : 2 capacity : 6 passengers length : 60 feet ( 18.3 metres ) @entity111 : 27 feet ( 8.3 metres ) height : 18 feet ( 5.5 metres ) with rudders down loaded weight : 9,740 kilograms ( 21,428 pounds ) alongside @entity115 is developing @entity13 , an unmanned payload - carrying rocket that would be sent into space from the same @entity79 plane			2
on board it will be capable of carrying experiments paid for by various companies around the world			0
the rocket , after detatching from @entity79 , will then accelerate to speeds that will enable it to enter low - @entity127 orbit , where it can then release the satellites it is carrying			0
and @entity0 has clearly seen the potential of this technology to launch satellites into orbit for a relatively low cost with its latest moves			2
earlier this week it bought satellite firm @entity7 as the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet to developing countries			2
the acquisition will initially be used to boost the quality of @entity0 's maps images as it battles @entity145			1
@entity7 has previously hit the headlines for capturing the first hd video footage of @entity127 from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being ' like live @entity0 maps			1
' @entity0 is buying @entity150 in a deal that could serve as a launching pad for the company to send its own fleet of satellites in to space			1
these satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world			0
this photo of @entity163 , @entity164 was taken by @entity7 on 18 february 2014 @entity165 - 1 , which was launched in november , captured up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second			2
satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity172 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
the circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100 - watt light bulb			0
the @entity181 group , @entity150 , is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of @entity127			0
@entity185 , an identical version of @entity165 - 1 , is scheduled to launch later in 2014			0
@entity0 plans to use @entity7 's satellite already in orbit to supplement the material it licenses from more than 1,000 sources , including other satellite companies such as @entity192 and @entity193			1
eventually , though , @entity7 could turn into another @entity0 ' moonshot ' - a term that chief executive @entity196 has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could take several years to materialise			1
@entity0 hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam internet access to points around the world			2
' @entity7 ’s satellites will help keep @entity46 accurate with up - to - date imagery , ' the firm said			2
' over time , we also hope that @entity7 ’s team and technology will be able to help improve internet access and disaster relief - areas @entity0 has long been interested in			1
' satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity172 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
shown here is a view of @entity217 @entity0 has made around 250 acquisitions during the past decade , using many of them to expand into new markets including maps and mobile devices			0
to the frustration of some investors , @entity0 also has been spending billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology , including driverless cars , internet - connected headwear , robots and a startup called @entity232 striving to find ways to slow the aging process			0
other investors have applauded @entity0 for having the vision and audacity to make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative products in the rapidly changing technology industry .			0

@entity1 tech giant is planning to invest in sir @entity10 's @entity9
reports claim the firm will buy a 1.5 *%* stake for £ 18 million ( $ 30 million )
this would give it access to a rocket capable of launching web satellites
the deal would also see hundreds of millions more invested in the space tourism company over the next few years
move follows @entity0 's acquisition of satellite maker @entity7
