revealed : @entity0 has leaked documents which say the @entity2 are creating a computer that could break the world 's strongest encryption tools the @entity2 plans to create a quantum computer that could break the strongest encryption tools in the world , according to documents leaked by @entity0			1
the former @entity2 contractor - turned whistleblower has provided documents which suggest that the @entity2 is on a code - breaking mission which could have revolutionary consequences for almost every type of encryption which protects records used by governments , banks and hospitals			1
the @entity2 plans to build a ‘ cryptologically useful quantum computer ’ as part of its $ 79.7 million research project , ‘ @entity29 , ’ through various classified contracts at a @entity23 laboratory in @entity24 , according to the @entity30			1
the leaked internal @entity2 document said : ‘ the application of quantum technologies to encryption algorithms threatens to dramatically impact the @entity37 government 's ability to both protect its communications and eavesdrop on the communications of foreign governments			1
’ the computer , which would be exponentially faster than a traditional computer , would be able to complete tasks in seconds whereas normal computers would usually take years to solve			0
comparing @entity2 ’s progress - which is kept top secret - to the best civilian labs has long been attempted by computer scientists and physicists			0
multi-million dollar project : the @entity2 ( pictured is the @entity52 complex ) plan to build a ' cryptologically useful quantum computer ' as part of its $ 79.7 million research project , ' @entity56 ' it seems the agency is keen to keep up with quantum computing labs sponsored by the @entity60 government and the @entity61 , who have made impressive progress in the last decade , striding ahead of @entity37 efforts			1
one leaked @entity2 document said : ‘ the geographic scope has narrowed from a global effort to a discrete focus on the @entity61 and @entity60			0
' cure disease ? @entity71 bought quantum computer @entity72 which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers in their bid to keep their progress secret , the @entity2 conducts some of its research in ‘ faraday cages , ’ metallic structures which stop the entry or escape of electromagnetic energy to ‘ keep delicate quantum computing experiments running , ’ according to a @entity2 document			1
in theory , a quantum computer can solve problems much faster than a classic computer , which is only capable of doing one calculation at a time			2
a quantum computer is able to avoid some calculations which are deemed unnecessary to solve the problem , making the process substantially more efficient			2
a working quantum computer would be capable of breaking a standard known as @entity100 which works to encrypt messages making it unreadable without a shared password			2
it is used most commonly by secure financial institutions , website browsers and in encrypted emails			0
recently @entity71 bought a quantum computer called @entity72 which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers			2
the company is hoping to use it to find cures for diseases , fix climate problems and help robots better understand human speech , for example			0
the company is hoping to unlock the power of the computer , which was built by @entity122 company @entity121 , at the new @entity123 , housed at @entity125 's @entity124 in @entity126			0
calculation capability : in theory a quantum computer can solve problems much faster than a normal computer ( pictured ) , which is only capable of doing one calculation at a time			0

the @entity2 plans to build a ' cryptologically useful quantum computer '
the plans were revealed in leaked documents from @entity0
it is part of the @entity2 's $ 79.7m ' penetrating @entity56 ' research project
it could break encryption codes which protect medical and bank records
