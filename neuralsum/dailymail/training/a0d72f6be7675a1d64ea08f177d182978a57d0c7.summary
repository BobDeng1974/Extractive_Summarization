by @entity0 horrified parents allegedly witnessed children as young as five being beaten in an unlicensed @entity4 kindergarten after staff forgot to turn off cctv cameras			1
staff at the @entity12 nursery , in the @entity8 city of @entity9 , used to leave cameras on each morning from 9am until 12noon so parents could watch their children playing and in lessons			1
the cameras were usually switched off at midday when the children were expected to go to sleep			1
but police and social workers investigating the incident say a parent who logged on after that time one day at the end of last year noticed the cameras were still running , and was shocked to see children allegedly being shouted at and abused			1
on a number of occasions , parents had allegedly questioned why the children had come home with bruises , but were always told it was as a result of being hit by one of the other youngsters in the nursery group			2
some of the cctv images were recorded apparently showing the children being pushed , dropped and dragged across the floor when they either refused to sleep or did not want to wake up			2
at one point , a female nursery worker can allegedly be heard shouting : ' if you do n't do as you 're told you will get a punch in the head , just go to sleep or you will get hit so badly and then i will kick you outside in the cold			2
' the nursery is still running due to a legal loophole which meant a change in the law left nobody responsible for closing it down until the criminal case is complete , according to @entity78			1
@entity79 , of the local @entity80 , said although the nursery was not licensed , there was nothing the authorities could do			0
lawyer @entity42 , who is representing the parents , said they had found that children were given red wine in their fruit juice to make them sleep on a number of occasions , parents had allegedly questioned why the children had come home with bruises , but were always told it was as a result of being hit by one of the other youngsters in the nursery group she said : ' it is correct that it is neither authorised or accredited however we can not go in and search the property and check it matches standards until they request a licence			1
not being in our database means we have no authority to check them			0
' mr @entity42 said the parents were also suing the owners of the nursery for compensation alongside the criminal investigation being carried out by authorities			0
he said : ' as you can imagine it was a shocking experience for the parents			0
' there were 60 or so children at the nursery			0
we only have images from two days but it is clear from the injuries the children had that this must have been going on all the time			0
' parents still using the nursery who saw the images on local television recently were told that they were manipulated by parents of a disabled child regarded as a troublemaker and that they were not to be trusted .			0
