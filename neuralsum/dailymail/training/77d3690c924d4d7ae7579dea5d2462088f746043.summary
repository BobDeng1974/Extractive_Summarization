by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:26 est , 26 january 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 28 january 2013 @entity3 's promise of a referendum on whether @entity5 should cut all ties with @entity7 has reversed the flood of @entity10 voters switching to @entity11			1
and pressure on @entity14 leader @entity13 to follow suit is set to grow after calls for him to back a nationwide vote on the issue won big support in a @entity21 poll			1
the survey suggests the prime minister ’s @entity24 referendum vow has prompted a @entity10 bounce , with @entity14 ’s lead cut by two points to seven per cent			1
according to the @entity30 poll for this newspaper , @entity14 has a clear lead on 38 per cent , followed by the @entity33 on 31 , @entity11 on 14 and the @entity34 on a lowly ten			1
the two - point gain for the conservatives since the @entity37 appears to have come directly from @entity11 , who are down by two			2
and the @entity10 received another boost today after @entity11 leader @entity40 announced he now aims to target pro-eu mr @entity13 instead of mr @entity3			1
mr @entity40 denounced the @entity43 ’s ‘ abject ’ refusal to back a nationwide in / out ballot on the @entity24 and said he was now ‘ gunning for @entity14 ’			1
it is a marked change in tone from mr @entity40 , whose sustained and vitriolic attacks on ‘ that man ’ mr @entity3 in the past year have seen @entity10 defectors take @entity11 ’s ratings to record levels			1
if mr @entity3 delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions , it could help his avowed aim of persuading voters to stay in the @entity24 in a separate move , former @entity14 prime minister @entity58 today uses a @entity21 article to urge pro-europeans to rally behind the campaign for an ‘ in ’ vote – and offers to help to mobilise supporters			1
‘ at present the @entity24 is the most powerful political union and biggest business market in the world , ’ he writes			0
‘ we will need it to remain at the top and we will need to be part of it			0
for the @entity5 to leave the bloc right on its doorstep would be an extraordinary denial of its own interests ... i believe there is a sensible , solid majority in the @entity5 for us to stay in @entity80			0
it is time to start mobilising it			0
’ mr @entity40 , also writing in this newspaper , said he planned to cash in on @entity14 ’s split over the referendum			1
‘ @entity3 wants to renegotiate our relationship with @entity80 , followed by an opportunity to vote “ out ” if he is elected after 2015 , ’ he writes			2
@entity13 exposed an ' open flank ' according to @entity11 leader @entity40 ‘ here was an open goal for the @entity14 to demand that referendum now			1
they could have called his bluff			0
@entity13 could have pressed the prime minister to give voters a say on @entity80 without ifs and buts			1
as a party , we not only see this as a political failure on @entity14 ’s part , but a betrayal			2
’ in a move which will be interpreted as a tacit ‘ pact ’ with the @entity10 , mr @entity40 is planning to concentrate election campaign resources on @entity14 - held councils and commons constituencies			1
a spring advertising offensive by @entity11 will highlight mr @entity13 ’s opposition to a referendum and blame @entity14 for failing to stem the expected wave of fresh immigration from @entity114 and @entity115 when restrictions are relaxed in december			1
‘ @entity13 has exposed an open flank , ’ mr @entity40 says			1
‘ we are going for the @entity14 ’s jugular			2
@entity11 is now a serious player in @entity5 politics and we are not going to go away			2
‘ we represent not just disgruntled , disenchanted conservatives but everyone in @entity5 affected by the loss of sovereignty that comes with being a member of the @entity24			0
’ the @entity30 figures help explain mr @entity40 ’s decision to chase votes from @entity14 supporters disillusioned with mr @entity13 ’s anti-eu referendum stance			1
a majority say mr @entity3 ’s @entity80 speech last week was ‘ statesmanlike ’			0
if the referendum was held today , @entity5 would vote by 50 per cent to 36 in favour of leaving the @entity24			2
the top three powers that voters want back from @entity7 are immigration , farming hand - outs and employment laws			0
if mr @entity3 delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions , it could help his avowed aim of persuading voters to stay in the @entity24			0
of those who currently want to leave , more than two out of five say it would make them reconsider			0
voters think @entity5 would be less of a world power outside the @entity24 , but they are swayed by the belief that they would be richer			0
a total of 41 per cent say we would be better off economically if we leave , against 26 who say we will be worse off			0
more than one in three say we would lose diplomatic clout , compared with one in five who say we would have more			0
but while mr @entity3 ’s @entity24 referendum policy gets a thumbs - up , there is widespread scepticism about his motives – and whether he will match his words with deeds			0
four out of ten say they do not trust him to deliver a referendum , against three out of ten who do			0
an overwhelming 62 per cent say the referendum vow is to stop a @entity10 split and undermine @entity11			1
just 26 per cent say the prime minister acted out of principle			0
worringly for mr @entity13 , demands by @entity171 for him to match mr @entity3 ’s referendum offer are supported by 45 per cent			2
but a @entity174 would pose risks : the survey emphasises @entity14 supporters are as overwhelmingly pro-eu as the @entity33 are overwhelmingly anti-eu .			2

@entity180 poll : voters desert @entity11 for @entity10
*nightmare* for @entity13 as @entity40 targets @entity14
@entity58 says he will ' mobilise ' pro-europe vote
