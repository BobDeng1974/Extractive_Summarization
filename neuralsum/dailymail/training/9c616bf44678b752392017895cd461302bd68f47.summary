if a time traveller went back in time and stopped their own grandparents from meeting , would they prevent their own birth ? that ’s the crux of an infamous theory known as the ' grandfather paradox ' , which is often said to mean time travel is impossible - but some researchers think otherwise			1
in the simulation a photon stuck in a closed timelike curve ( illustrated ) through a wormhole was found to be capable of interacting with one travelling through regular space - time the research was carried out by a team of researchers at the @entity19 in @entity20 and their results are published in the journal @entity32			1
space - time can be warped and distorted			2
it takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions , but theoretically , distortions are possible			0
in the case of a wormhole , a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space - time			2
imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space - time			0
the line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space - time			2
if the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space - time - then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points , in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut			1
the problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable			0
when a particle enters a wormhole , it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it			0
a recent study suggests there are unusual - shaped wormholes than may be able to stay open longer than normal			0
the study used photons - single particles of light - to simulate quantum particles travelling back through time			1
by studying their behaviour , the scientists revealed possible bizarre aspects of modern physics			2
in the simulation , the researchers examined two possible outcomes for a time - travelling photon			1
in the simulation , the researchers examined the behaviour of a photon traveling through time and interacting with its older self			2
in their experiment they made use of the closely related , fictitious , case where the photon travels through normal space - time and interacts with another photon that is stuck in a time - travelling loop through a wormhole , known as a closed timelike curve ( @entity106 )			1
simulating the behaviour of this second photon , they were able to study the behaviour of the first - and the results show that consistent evolutions can be achieved when preparing the second photon in just the right way			0
by definition ‘ quantum ’ refers to the smallest possible particles that can independently exist - such as photons			1
however , for macroscopic systems time - travel still faces problematic paradoxes			1
in 1991 it was first predicted that time travel would be possible in the ‘ quantum world ’ because quantum particles behave almost outside the realms of physics			1
wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space - time			0
a study in may from dr @entity131 at @entity132 argued that if a thin wormhole stayed open long enough , people could send messages through time using pulses of light , or photons ' the properties of quantum particles are " fuzzy " or uncertain to start with , so this gives them enough wiggle room to avoid inconsistent time travel situations , ' said professor @entity144 , one of the researchers on the latest study			1
the results also give a better understand to how two theories in physics , on the biggest and smallest scales , are able to relate to one another			0
' the question of time travel features at the interface between two of our most successful yet incompatible physical theories ' @entity158 's general relativity and quantum mechanics , ' said phd student @entity161 from the @entity19			1
' @entity158 's theory describes the world at the very large scale of stars and galaxies , while quantum mechanics is an excellent description of the world at the very small scale of atoms and molecules			0
' @entity158 's theory suggests the possibility of travelling backwards in time by following a space - time path that returns to the starting point in space but at an earlier time - a closed timelike curve ( @entity106 )			1
this possibility has puzzled physicists and philosophers alike since it was discovered by @entity183 - @entity182 scientist @entity181 in 1949 , as it seems to cause paradoxes in the classical world			2
these include the ' grandparents paradox ' , where a time traveller could stop their grandparents from meeting , thus preventing the time traveller 's birth			0
this would make it impossible for the time traveller to have set out in the first place			0
but this new research suggests that such interactions might indeed be possible - albeit only on a quantum level .			0

@entity19 scientists simulate photons moving through time
they showed how two wormhole - travelling photons might behave
time - travel in the quantum world seems to avoid famous paradoxes
the experiment shows bizarre behaviour of such quantum particles
but on larger scales time travel still remains *implausible* , say researchers
