@entity1 sen. @entity0 again said this morning that she 's not running for president , regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the @entity7 nomination in 2016			1
' you know , i 'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance			1
that 's what i 'm in this fight for , and i 'm in this fight all the way , ' @entity13 told @entity19 today during an interview to discuss her latest battle to keep in place reforms that rein in @entity24			1
the left - wing darling was careful not to say that she was ' never ' running , however , leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she 's letting on publicly			1
if former secretary of state @entity31 ultimately decides not to take a second go at higher office , @entity13 's supporters hope she 'll pick up the torch			1
@entity1 sen. @entity0 , a member of the @entity35 , right , is pictured here with rep. @entity37 , ranking member of the @entity38 , at a press conference last week to express their outrage that a huge , $ 1.1 trillion spending bill put forward by the @entity42 - controlled @entity38 contains changes to the 2010 @entity45 law that regulates complex financial instruments known as derivatives @entity13 led the charge on @entity49 last week against a provision in the $ 1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that would roll back restrictions on financial institutions passed in the 2010 @entity45 bill			1
in an impassioned speech on the @entity35 floor that has been characterized as a career - defining moment for the freshman legislator , @entity13 ripped the rider as a measure that ' would do nothing for the middle class , do nothing for community banks , do nothing but raise the risk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again			2
' ' so let me say this to anyone who is listening at @entity72 [ group ]			0
i agree with you @entity45 is n't perfect			0
it should have broken you into pieces , ' she said , directing her anger at the multinational banking group whose lobbyists are credited with authoring the offending measure			0
' instead of passing laws that create new bailout opportunities for too big to fail banks , let 's pass ... something ... that would help break up these giant banks , ' she said			0
continuing , @entity13 said , ' @entity88 is enough with @entity24 insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch			2
' @entity97 already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists			0
' but what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings the last time @entity72 bet big on derivatives and lost ? what about the families who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars go to bail out @entity72 just 6 years ago ? ' she asked			0
@entity13 said that lawmakers were sent to the nation 's capitol ' to fight for those families , ' and it ' tt is time - it is past time ' for them to start living up to that mandate			1
while she ultimately failed to convince a majority of her party to oppose the bill and it passed both chambers of @entity127 , the move set alight new calls from the left for her to compete for the presidency in next year 's contest			1
the left - wing lawmaker , beloved by progressives for her unwavering commitment to holding big banks accountable and fighting for laws she believes will benefit the middle class , comes nowhere close to earning the support of @entity141 in polls of @entity7 voters			1
@entity13 often trails party frontrunner @entity141 by 40 or more points			2
hard - core @entity13 supporters believe that ' @entity146 ' could create an opening for their icon to seek and win the @entity7 nomination , however			2
even if @entity141 does continue to track well , the @entity13 wing of @entity7 wants the @entity1 senator to enter the 2016 horse race to force the party to the left on marquee issues			1
in a statement released by the @entity159 today , the organization 's co-founder @entity156 said ' it is time for @entity7 to remold the party around @entity0 's big economic populist ideas -- like breaking up " too big to fail " banks , expanding @entity163 , and making college way more affordable			2
' ' the way for @entity7 to inspire the public is to give @entity169 the debate about big ideas that we deserve -- and that means following @entity0 's lead , ' she said			0
former secretary of state and 2016 frontrunner @entity31 is pictured here at a press conference today			0
@entity141 has not announced her intentions to run for president yet , but she is widely expected to do so in the coming months			0
either way , @entity13 supporters believe their candidate should enter the race			2
of specific concern to @entity13 's supporters is @entity141 's cozy relationship with financial institutions			1
as a candidate for office in the past , @entity141 accepted funds from wealthy financiers progressives believe are responsible for the 2008 financial meltdown			0
since leaving the @entity195 administration last year she 's collected checks in excess of $ 200,000 a piece from some of the same institutions who benefited from government bailouts six years ago while on the speaking circuit			1
progressives fear that @entity141 wo n't be an effective check on the big banks currently lining her pockets if elected to office and have fiercely advocated on behalf of alternative candidate @entity13			0
' i ’d love to see [ @entity141 ] match [ @entity13 ’s ] talking points in terms of the economy , just reforming @entity24 , ' @entity215 , a political activist from @entity216 told @entity217 over the weekend during a progressive gathering in @entity97 ' she ’s [ @entity141 's ] been absolutely silent as the @entity45 legislation is being rolled back			1
where was she ? ' he continued			0
in off - chance that @entity13 changes her mind and does decide to run for higher office next year , a group of @entity7 operatives has set up a political action committee called @entity228 to collect information on probable supporters that it can then pass on to @entity13 's official campaign if she jumps in the race			1
the @entity13 operation mimics the strategy of a similar group set up in @entity141 's name			1
the movement to draft @entity13 has gained steam in recent weeks , as several other possible presidential candidates ' self - imposed deadlines to announce their intentions draws near			2
at the same time @entity13 's latest stand against big banks on @entity49 has the political class buzzing as the move put her in direct opposition to the @entity38			1
as support for the massive appropriations bill to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year waned last thursday , the @entity195 administration came out in favor of the compromise legislation and strongly urged @entity7 lawmakers to do the same			2

' the @entity38 made clear that it too was unhappy with the provision of the bill that eliminated restrictions on @entity24 but warned that @entity7 would likely end up with even less preferable legislation if they forced the issue			2
' this is ultimately not a difference over the value of the provision , it ’s a difference -- at least among @entity7 -- over the strategy , ' @entity38 press secretary @entity304 said on friday			0
' the president is certainly sympathetic to those who say this is a terrible provision ... the president himself has concerns about the provision and opposes it , ' @entity304 explained			0
' but the president did make a strategic decision about the wisdom of signing the agreement that was before him , as opposed to kicking the can down the road and trying to broker an agreement in which @entity42 had more leverage , ' he said			0
in january when the new @entity127 convenes @entity42 will outnumber @entity7 in both legislative chambers , giving them the upper hand until the next set of federal elections , two years from now			0
@entity13 acknowledged the difficult position the @entity38 found itself in when considering whether to back the legislation in her interview with @entity19 today and conceded that approving the legislation was ultimately the correct call			1
' you know , once the @entity38 passed an omnibus bill with this in it and threw it over to the @entity35 — and then the @entity38 left town — at that point , there was very little choice but either to pass the omnibus , even with this thing in it , or shut down the government , ' she said			0
' and we did n't want to shut down the government			0
' sticking by her principles , though , she derided the provision 's supporters for the way they went about making changes to the regulatory system			0
' i know for sure that this should n't be slipped into an omnibus spending bill — a bill that must pass in order to keep the government open , ' she said			1
' and what it means , if this works , is they can just kinda keep slipping grenades and attach them to , you know , must - pass spending bills , and pretty soon we have no financial regulations at all , ' she warned .			2

' i 'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance . that 's what i 'm in this fight for , and i 'm in this fight all the way '
