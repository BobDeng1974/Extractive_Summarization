when @entity2 documentary reinventing the @entity3 was first listed on tv schedules in @entity5 december , few paid it much attention			1
but when claims that @entity9 had refused to release archive footage and had tried to stop it from being aired emerged in the @entity12 , the programme suddenly became front page news			2
tonight , reinventing the @entity3 , a two - part series written and presented by @entity18 journalist @entity16 will finally air , while @entity9 has denied ever trying to prevent it			1
with his personal popularity in the doldrums , @entity30 asked @entity36 guru @entity35 , who was hired in 1996 , to give his public image a makeover - and integrate @entity38 into palace life			0
dubbed ' @entity41 ' , the campaign is the source of one of the most embarrassing allegations aired in the programme - namely that @entity35 leaked news of prince @entity48 's first meeting with @entity38 to the media			0
@entity35 has denied this incident ever happened , but the @entity51 was reportedly left angry and upset by the leak and is said to have nicknamed the pr supremo ' @entity53 '			1
but even that has been overshadowed by the controversy over the programme itself , which @entity9 insists it never tried to interfere with			2
' the original broadcast of the programme was delayed by mutual agreement ( @entity2 and @entity9 ) whilst permissions were sought , ' said a @entity9 spokesman			0
investigation : the series , fronted by @entity16 ( c ) , delves into the media 's relationship with the royals controversial : @entity68 was editor of @entity18 when it broadcast the infamous 1995 princess @entity27 interview ' all permissions were subsequently granted			1
we have not seen the programme yet and have no comment to make			0
' nevertheless , the ensuing row reportedly left prince @entity30 ' furious ' - all the more so when lurid claims of spats between the @entity79 and @entity9 press teams emerged			1
worse still , the row overshadowed what had been , until then , a successful year , with the royal widely praised for his hard work and the positive headlines generated by overseas tours to @entity85 and @entity86 among others			0
for its part , the @entity2 says the documentary was always going to be aired , with a spokesman telling @entity91 that coverage is going ahead ' as planned '			0
' before @entity93 it became clear that there were issues relating to the clearance of archive footage in the forthcoming programme reinventing the @entity3 , ' continued the @entity2 spokesman			2
campaign : much of the controversy focuses on @entity35 ( l ) and @entity102 ( r ) also features unimpressed : the @entity51 ( l ) reportedly referred to @entity35 as ' @entity53 ' ' these issues have now been resolved and all the archive material we planned to use is included in the finished programme			0
' the first episode of reinventing the @entity3 will be broadcast on 19 february and it will be the one that we always intended to show			2
' the footage includes the first - ever television interview with @entity102 , who was press secretary to prince @entity30 at the time of princess @entity27 's death			1
even before the accident , the @entity22 was worried his image was ' in tatters ' while the royal family were also alarmed by the anti-monarchist feeling following the @entity27 's death in @entity120			1
' ( @entity30 ) was getting some pretty virulent criticism - bad father , unloving husband , ' ms @entity102 said in the documentary			0
furious : @entity30 was reportedly unhappy about the way the row overshadowed his work success : 2014 had been a successful year but ended on a sour note because of the controversy ' i think he was pretty hurt ... if you 've got a middle - aged balding man and a beautiful princess , it 's a no - brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage			1
' @entity16 , the editor of @entity18 at the time of the infamous 1995 interview with princess @entity27 , presents the show and describes how prince @entity30 hired @entity35 from the @entity143 to act as a spin doctor for the royal family following @entity27 's death			1
the younger royals also make an appearance in the documentary , among them @entity150 who at one point opines : ' i do n't believe there is any such thing as privacy anymore			0
' @entity156 , if nothing else , to the sometimes troubled relationship between the royals and the @entity143 .			0

@entity9 says it never tried to block *transmission* of the show
