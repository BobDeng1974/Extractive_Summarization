by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 8 november 2013 @entity1 was rocked by a further downgrade to its credit rating yesterday as the country ’s economic woes mounted			1
credit agency @entity6 ’s cut its rating on @entity1 debt from @entity9 + to aa in a humiliating setback for president @entity11 and his socialist administration			1
in a devastating analysis , the agency highlighted the risks posed by weak economic growth , high unemployment , the rising national debt and ‘ elevated ’ levels of tax and spending			0
the move , which made a mockery of mr @entity11 ’s claim in august that ‘ the recovery is here ’ , sparked a furious reaction in @entity27			1
finance minister @entity28 said : ‘ i deplore certain judgments that , i think , are inexact criticisms			0
they underestimate the ability of @entity1 to transform itself , to right itself			2
’ not so creditworthy : @entity6 poured humiliation on president @entity11 but @entity34 , an economist at @entity1 bank @entity35 , said the ratings downgrade ‘ is another reminder of @entity1 ’s challenges ’			1
@entity39 , an economist at @entity41 banking group @entity40 , said : ‘ this comes as another wake - up call to the @entity1 government			1
’ the downgrade – which could push up @entity1 borrowing costs as investors worry about the country ’s credit - worthiness – came less than two years after @entity1 was stripped of its aaa rating			1
it also sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone			0
in a further blow to mr @entity11 , official figures showed industrial output unexpectedly fell in september while the country ’s trade deficit with the rest of the world worsened			2
the bleak data suggested that the @entity1 economy ground to a halt in the third quarter of the year after a brief recovery in the second quarter			2
@entity6 says it expects unemployment in @entity1 to remain above 10 per cent until 2016 and to see net government debt to peak at 86 per cent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2015 analysts at @entity73 estimate that the economy shrank by 0.1 per cent between july and september , leaving @entity1 on the verge of another recession			0
it made grim reading for mr @entity11 who has failed to revive the eurozone ’s second largest economy and seen his approval ratings plummet since his election in 2012			0
the @entity83 this week cut interest rates in the eurozone from 0.5 per cent to a record low of 0.25 per cent as it stepped up its fight against sluggish growth in the region and the threat of deflation			0
it came just days after the @entity92 predicted that @entity93 will be the best performing major economy in @entity95 in 2013 , 2014 and 2015 – outstripping the eurozone big four of @entity97 , @entity1 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity6 warned that the modest reforms mr @entity11 has implemented ‘ will not substantially raise @entity1 ’s medium - term growth prospects ’			1
it blamed ‘ successive government ’ moves to increase already - high tax levels and ‘ the government ’s inability to significantly reduce total government spending ’			0
@entity1 unemployment hit a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3million in september and more than a quarter of under - 25s can not find work .			2

the move comes two years after the country lost its top - rated @entity116 status
polls show @entity11 as one of the most *unpopular* @entity1 presidents ever
