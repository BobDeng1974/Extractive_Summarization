@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 ensure the @entity3 will have three teams represented in the @entity5 last 16 , despite @entity7 's limp group stage exit			1
the @entity8 and @entity10 's team cruised through their respective groups and are joined by the @entity3 champions , whose stunning win in @entity14 sealed their progress			0
here , @entity16 gives you a guide to their @entity5 exploits so far and who they can face in monday 's draw for the last 16 when the competition resumes in february			2
like in previous years there was very little doubt the @entity8 would end up sailing through in @entity44 , despite an opening day loss at @entity46			0
the @entity48 side and the @entity8 quickly became runaway leaders and the question became which one of the two would top the pile ? @entity55 - to - head there was nothing between them so it ultimately came down to @entity46 's ability to comfortably beat @entity61 and @entity62 just a bit easier than @entity65 's team managed , and sneak top spot on goal difference			0
the next question is will the north @entity70 side have to yet again take on another @entity72 giant in the last 16 ? it 's almost becoming a pattern			0
@entity0 celebrate their final - day 4 - 1 victory in @entity62 which confirmed their status as group runners - up @entity46 and @entity0 finished neck - and - neck on points as they dominated @entity44 @entity1 group placing : winners ( seeded ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : semi-finals ( vs @entity34 ) 2012 - 13 : group stage 2011 - 12 : winners 2010 - 11 : quarter - finals ( vs @entity87 ) 2009 - 10 : last 16 ( vs @entity88 ) who can they face ? @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity23 , @entity94 odds to win @entity5 : 11/2 like @entity0 , a stumble on the opening day following a @entity99 home draw with @entity100 was about as nervous as it got for @entity1 , as they cruised through @entity102 and had the group won with a game to spare			1
the @entity106 ' two big tests were brushed off , with a 1 - 0 win in @entity108 trumped by an emphatic 5 - 0 victory at @entity100 as @entity10 's outfit made light work of their supposed rivals in the group			0
their only slip up away from home came in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity116 , but a 6 - 0 thrashing of the @entity119 minnows on the previous matchday meant the result was more of a nuisance than the start of a major panic			0
dreams of a second @entity5 crown have remained steady as tougher tests will be sure to come at @entity99 , but the current @entity3 leaders are fourth favourites behind @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity35 heading into the last 16			1
@entity130 ( left ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring a penalty in the 3 - 1 win over @entity108			0
the @entity106 were confirmed as group winners before the fixture was even played @entity1 cruised to top spot with little trouble and ended the group stage unbeaten , progressing with @entity100 @entity2 group placing : runners - up ( unseeded ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : last 16 ( vs @entity30 ) 2012 - 13 : group stage 2011 - 12 : group stage 2010 - 11 : did not qualify 2009 - 10 : did not qualify who can they face ? @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity46 , @entity30 , @entity37 odds to win @entity5 : 12/1 by contrast to @entity1 and @entity0 , @entity2 looked like they were on a fast - ticket to a @entity5 exit for a large majority of their group stage campaign			1
even with two games to play @entity2 had n't won a game , and with a daunting home tie against @entity28 and a testing trip to @entity158 left - @entity157 's side looked doomed			0
but @entity160 's stunning hat - trick to defeat the @entity48 champions , and a magnificent performance to win 2 - 0 in @entity158 saw @entity2 through in dramatic circumstances as group runners - up			2
it leaves them with daunting last 16 prospects , but it keeps them feeding alongside @entity168 's elite which just about every @entity2 fan would have taken after sitting bottom and winless following a home defeat by @entity172 after matchday four			2
@entity173 celebrates his opener as @entity2 beat @entity158 2 - 0 to fire them into the @entity5 last 16 @entity28 eased through as group winners , but @entity2 sneaked through as group runners - up @entity177 not thinking about group permutations how the @entity5 last 16 draw works group winners will be drawn against runners - up , with the exception that teams from the same association as well as the same @entity5 group can not face each other			1
this means @entity0 can not play @entity1 , @entity2 or @entity46 while the @entity106 will evade @entity108 as well as @entity65 's team and the @entity3 champions - who avoid @entity28			1
seeded group winners will be away in the last 16 first legs on 17/18 and 25/26 february and at home in the return matches on 10/11 and 17/18 march			2
the draw will take place from @entity197 on monday at 11am gmt. group winners @entity34 @entity35 @entity36 @entity46 @entity28 @entity30 @entity1 @entity37 @entity199 @entity91 @entity92 @entity93 @entity0 @entity2 @entity23 @entity100 @entity94			1

@entity0 and @entity2 unseeded for @entity5 last 16 draw
@entity1 set to be dealt kinder fate in *knockout* stages as group winners
@entity35 and @entity30 could be drawn against @entity8 or @entity2
