@entity0 , a 26 - year - old software programmer , graduated with top honors from the vaunted @entity2			1
his education and skills mean he could work nearly anywhere			0
he chooses to work on @entity6 , earning six figures designing software for a high - frequency trading firm			1
there , his earning potential is all but unlimited			0
@entity0 's life goal is to earn as much money as he possibly can , but it 's not so he can buy expensive cars , luxury homes and designer clothing			2
he wants to save the world and he believes that the more money he makes , the more good he can do			2
modest : @entity0 , 26 , says he donated half of his six - figure income from working at a high - frequency trading firm to charity the @entity22 reports that last year , he gave half his salary - tens of thousands of dollars - away to the @entity24			1
the charity estimates that $ 2,500 can save one life			1
by that calculus , @entity0 figures he can save more lives earning a vast salary in finance that he could if he dedicated his life to public service			2
a core of idealistic young professionals have joined @entity6 banks , hedge funds , and major tech companies that pay large salaries , all with the idea that their best chance of making the world a better place is earning as much money as possible - and then putting that money to good use			1
' a lot of people , they want to make a difference and end up in the @entity51 and in the developing world without running water , ' @entity0 told the @entity22			1
' i can donate some of my time in the office and make more of a difference			0
' despite @entity0 's high - paying job , he lives with three roommates and walks to work every day			2
he tries to live as conservatively as possible			0
the most good : @entity0 donates most of his earnings to the @entity24 , which says it can save a life for $ 2,500 ' i would nâ€™t know how to spend a large amount of money , ' he says			1
charities like @entity67 and 80,000 hours - a reference to the number of working hours in a career - have been established to help civic - minded young people make choices about their lives and careers that will help the most people			1
nearly all of the charities focus on improving health conditions in the developing world - since money sent to poor countries can go much farther than any donations made to help @entity82			1
' you can pay to provide and train a guide dog for a blind @entity82 , which costs about $ 40,000 , ' @entity83 , a @entity84 graduate who works in finance , told the @entity22			0
' but with that money you could also cure between 400 and 2,000 people in developing countries of blindness from glaucoma , which costs about $ 20 per person			0
' wage says he gives about half of his incomes to charities that work in @entity100 and @entity101			0
@entity102 , who works as a programmer for @entity104 , tells the @entity22 that he and his wife lived on $ 10,000 last year			0
they allowed themselves just $ 165 a month for groceries and a mere $ 38 a week each of non-essential spending , including eating out			0
together they gave away 45percent of their income			0
modest living : @entity102 , a @entity104 programmer , and his wife @entity115 , right , lived on just $ 10,000 last year and donated 45percent of their earnings to charity			2

some young people believe that working on @entity6 and living modesty - and donating the rest - will allow them to do the most good
@entity0 , a software programmer at a financial firm , donates to a *malaria* charity that says it can save a life for every $ 2,500 it receives
charities like @entity67 and 80,000 hours help civic - minded young people make choices about their lives and careers that will help the most people
