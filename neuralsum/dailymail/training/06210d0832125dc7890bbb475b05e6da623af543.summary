children as young as 11 have been victims of ‘ revenge porn ’ , new figures have revealed			1
school pupils are having their lives ruined by classmates posting explicit images – either obtained consensually or stolen – online without permission to humiliate them			1
adults have also been blackmailed into having sex with their tormentors after being threatened with having supposedly private images of them naked placed on the internet			1
figures uncovered using freedom of information laws revealed 149 cases of revenge porn in the last three years – although campaigners said this was the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’			1
of the eight police forces who responded , the number of incidents had risen from 35 in 2012 to 58 a year later			0
in the first six months of 2014 , there were 56 cases reported – meaning the total is expected to double by the end of the year			0
worryingly , only six incidents resulted in a police caution or charge – meaning the culprits in many cases have escaped scot - free			0
@entity26 and @entity27 have both recently had nude photos posted online by a hacker police are largely powerless to stop the unpleasant practice until specific new laws intended to make revenge porn a crime , which are currently going through @entity57 , are introduced			1
@entity58 , of the @entity61 @entity60 helpline , said the true scale of the problem remained hidden			0
she said : ‘ i feel this is just the tip of the iceberg			1
plenty of people , particularly young people , wo n’t want to go down the police route or even speak about them at all , so many incidents are going unnoticed			0
‘ our research shows that for every site we find , there are potentially dozens with those images on which the victim has no idea about			2
‘ we are living in an age where technology is a part of our everyday lives , and children are becoming sexualised at a younger age			2
former culture secretary @entity86 has worked to stamp out revenge porn ‘ but we must do what we can to tackle bullying , harassment and sharing explicit content without permission			1
’ @entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ‘ the ability to abuse through technology is growing fast and its impact is very real , which is why politicians and the police must get to grips with it			2
’ the survey revealed a girl aged just 11 from @entity104 had indecent images of her posted on the internet			1
in @entity108 , a schoolboy circulated naked photos of a fellow pupil on @entity111 so all her friends could see them			0
in another case in the county , a taxi driver blackmailed a passenger into having sex after discovering naked images of her , and another man was coerced into having gay sex amid fears a woman would post naked photos of him on social media			2
former culture secretary @entity86 , who has campaigned to stamp out the despicable trend , said the data showed revenge porn was more widespread than previously thought			1
she said : ‘ police are finding it difficult to know how to react when incidents are reported			0
all of this points to the need for a clarification of the law , and also to make sure it ’s clear revenge porn and the posting of it is a criminal offence			1
this is not a victimless crime - it is a sexual act against another individual			0
’ a @entity111 spokesman said : ‘ @entity111 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content			2
we encourage people to use our reporting tools to highlight anything they find unacceptable			0
if it breaks our rules it will be removed			0
