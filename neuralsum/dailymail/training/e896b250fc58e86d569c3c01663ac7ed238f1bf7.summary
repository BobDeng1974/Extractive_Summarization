a furious dad has slammed a school after his six - year - old son was banned from wearing a @entity4 band in class on health and safety grounds			1
@entity9 's son @entity8 had been wearing the band , decorated with the @entity4 symbol of a fish , out of sight for six months			1
but when a teacher spotted @entity8 scratching his ankle she noticed the band , covered by his sock , and ordered him to hand it over			0
now he is being kept at home after he was banned from wearing the band at school on health and safety grounds			1
banned : six - year - old @entity22 ( left ) was told he was not allowed to wear the @entity4 band around his ankle at school			1
his father @entity9 ( right ) , 39 , is now keeping him at home until the situation is resolved mr @entity9 , 39 , is demanding an apology from the head at @entity28 in @entity29 , near @entity30 , and is keeping @entity8 at home until the situation is resolved			1
he has made a series of complaints and says he believes the school is discriminating against him because he is a @entity4 , after @entity8 was told he could not wear the band at school			1
mr @entity9 , from @entity29 , said : ' i could n’t believe it when @entity8 told me what had happened			2
' he wears the band because he wants to feel that @entity42 is always with him			0
he has had it on for the past six months and makes sure it is covered by his sock , so it ’s not on display or posing any kind of risk			0
' no one has said a thing about it for all this time but when one of the teachers spotted it when @entity8 had an itchy ankle and was scratching it she took it off him			0
' when i complained about this to the school they were very blunt and said bands like this were banned			2
i think they ’re discriminating against him because he ’s a @entity4			0
this is a symbol of his faith			0
headteacher @entity68 has said the school ' has a clear uniform policy in place to help families understand what pupils can and can not wear whilst at school ' ' i ’m particularly angry and upset at the school because during the summer they were actually selling rubber charity bands to raise money			1
' it does n’t make sense to me that now they say they are banned yet in the summer they were selling them on school property			0
ruling : the incident follows the recent victory by airline worker @entity89 who won a court battle after being banned from wearing a @entity4 cross while working at a check - in counter ' i do n’t want his education to suffer but i do n’t want to send him back at this stage and when he does go back i ’m worried about how he will be treated			2
