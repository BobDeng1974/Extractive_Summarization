by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's future number one @entity4 played a key role in their @entity7 downfall on wednesday , producing a display for @entity9 that highlighted to @entity10 what a ‘ very special ’ goalkeeper he is			1
having established himself as @entity15 's first - choice goalkeeper when only a teenager , the @entity16 paid a reported £ 7.9million to sign the highly - rated @entity18 in 2011			1
@entity4 has yet to feature for @entity3 three years on having been farmed out on loan to @entity9 , where he has established himself as one of the best young goalkeepers in the world			1
scroll down to watch @entity24 explain how @entity4 changed the game special : @entity4 made a stunning stop to deny @entity3 skipper @entity27 beaten : @entity10 could do nothing to stop @entity29 putting @entity9 ahead from the spot @entity3 found that out first - hand on wednesday as the 21 - year - old helped knock his parent club out of the @entity7 at the semi-final juncture , with @entity24 highlighting his save to deny a second - half @entity27 header as the key moment given @entity29 netted moments later			1
opposite number @entity10 went and congratulated @entity4 after @entity43 's 3 - 1 win and the 41 - year - old believes @entity3 have an exceptional player on their books			1
‘ he is very special and it is no surprise that @entity3 signed him a couple of years ago , ’ said the @entity47 , who made his first - team bow two years before @entity4 was born			1
‘ there has been a lot spoken about him and he has been outstanding			2
he was outstanding ( against us ) and he has a huge , huge career ahead of him			2
‘ if we 'd been a bit more lucky , and him a bit unlucky , we could have possibly got back into the game and created a few more nervy moments at the end for them			2
it was n't the case			2
‘ he did very well and it was no surprise that @entity3 signed him and want to keep him at the club			2
i would n't be surprised if they give him a new deal			2
despair : @entity4 was unable to stop @entity72 ' strike putting @entity3 ahead but responded brilliantly has it covered : @entity4 was on form as he took on his parent club dilemma : @entity24 will have a decision to make if @entity4 returns to @entity3 this summer ‘ he 's had a fantastic season , as has @entity9			1
they 're top of @entity80 and vying to win the championship and now the @entity7 final too			0
’ @entity10 became the oldest player to ever start a @entity7 knockout tie against @entity43 , playing after an injury to @entity86			1
the 31 - year - old @entity86 has been undisputed number one at @entity88 for the past decade , but @entity4 ' fine displays is making that position look weak for the first time			1
‘ it 's a very tough decision and i 'm glad i 'm not the one that has to make it , ’ @entity10 said with a smile			0
‘ i do n't have a clue what they will decide it on			0
they are both world - class keepers			0
‘ i would n't even say they are at different ends of their careers because @entity106 still has a long way to go in his			0
he can improve at 31			0
’ @entity86 is likely to miss the rest of the campaign with a dislocated shoulder sustained in the first leg , meaning @entity10 will again be between the sticks when @entity3 turn to domestic action this weekend			1
@entity114 and new : @entity86 ( left ) is out for the season and faces a challenge from @entity4 for his place next year @entity24 has given his side friday off ahead of the penultimate game of the season against @entity121 on sunday - a match they approach two points off the top after their smash - and - grab 2 - 0 win at leaders @entity129 last weekend			1
‘ we need to put the others under pressure , ’ @entity10 said			0
‘ we put ourselves back in the race with the win at @entity129 and we have to make sure we maintain it			0
we could still have something to play for in the last game at @entity138			0
‘ there is still a chance so we ca n't be sorry for ourselves			0
down and out : @entity10 was beaten three times as @entity3 crashed out but insists they fight on ‘ we have to pick ourselves up from this disappointment and realise we must keep banging on the door with the game against @entity121 on sunday			0
‘ we must make sure we pick up three points so we can capitalise on any slip - ups			0
