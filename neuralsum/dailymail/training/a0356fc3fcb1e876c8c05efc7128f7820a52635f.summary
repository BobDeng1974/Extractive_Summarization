@entity1 no 8 @entity0 is set to see a specialist next week in the latest phase of his recovery from a broken leg			1
@entity0 underwent surgery after suffering the injury during @entity10 's @entity9 victory over @entity11 last friday			1
he is now destined to miss @entity1 's entire @entity13 campaign , which starts against @entity14 in @entity15 on february 6			2
@entity0 ( centre ) is tackled during @entity10 's game against @entity11 in january the @entity10 star is taken off on a stretcher after suffering a broken leg but the @entity21 on @entity23 soil later this year will remain a target for a player who shone for @entity1 during this season 's autumn campaign			1
' @entity29 went well and was successful , and we will look at getting him in to see the specialist next tuesday , so we will have a better idea then , ' @entity10 rugby director @entity28 said on thursday			2
' but , so far , the reports have been encouraging			0
' the mental part is probably harder than the physical part			0
we all know that , in the game we play , one of the inevitable consequences for any player is that he will be injured			0
although @entity0 has been ruled out of the @entity13 , he is hopeful of returning for the @entity21 @entity0 screams after scoring a try for @entity1 against @entity41 at @entity42 in november 2013 ' i am sure it will be difficult for him to sit at home and watch the @entity13 , but he has a huge goal in front of him , which is the @entity21 and preparing himself to be fit for that			1
' i am not sure of the detail of the operation , and i think , at this stage , he has been given the best opportunity to get back fit as soon as possible			0
' @entity1 head coach @entity53 will name his squad ahead of the @entity13 next wednesday , with @entity55 8 @entity57 favourite to start against @entity14			2
