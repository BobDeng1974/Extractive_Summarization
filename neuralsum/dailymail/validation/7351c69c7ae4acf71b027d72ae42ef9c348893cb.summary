many wearables record your movements but one firm has developed a range designed to help you track other people			1
these include bands that keep tabs on your children , your elderly relatives and your pets			1
each device is controlled via an app where a parent , concerned relative or pet owner can monitor and track its wearer 's every move			1
a @entity20 firm called @entity21 has developed a range of wearables that help you track other people			1
senior bands with a leather strap have gps technology built in so relatives can keep an eye on elderly people the range was unveiled by @entity20 tech giant @entity21 at @entity33 in @entity34			1
its child and senior bands have gps technology built - in but while the former is bright and colourful , the latter has a more classic look with a leather strap			1
both are waterproof and are fitted with proximity sensors that feed location to an app where users can monitor the wearable ’s movements on a map			1
colourful wearables for children also track their location			2
they are fitted with proximity sensors that feed a child 's location to an app so that parents can see their location on a map phone maker @entity61 has launched a social networking tool for seniors called @entity64			1
it connects elderly people with relatives and carers and the service can be used to call for help and assistance in an emergency			0
alternatively , the firm said it can also provide help with basic everyday household tasks such as closing a window			0
the service is optional and comes with @entity61 phones , and there is an @entity78 and @entity79 app for relatives to keep an eye on the user and monitor their movement and communication			0
it gives alerts to the family if irregularities are detected – for example loss of movement			0
the app will also remind them to call their relative regularly			0
concerned parents and relatives can also use the app to set up safe zones , meaning if a child or elderly relative leaves a dedicated zone , the app will send them an alert			2
the app also stores a log of the wearable ’s gps history			0
although many apps and bands track people in a similar way , @entity21 claims its devices differ because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker			2
similar to how a baby monitor works , the user can listen to ambient noises around the device to determine their location if there is a problem , for example			0
users of the app can also talk to the wearer through the band			0
and for pet owners , @entity21 has also developed a smart collar that works in a similar way but for cats and dogs			1
in the future @entity128 said it plans to launch an @entity131 service that can be accessed directly from the band in the case of emergency			0
the company did n’t announce prices or availability for the devices			0
@entity21 has also developed a smart collar for dogs			2
the firm claims its devices differ from others on the market already because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker the @entity145 ( pictured ) - a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog 's health , track their location and even allows owners to speak to their dogs remotely doting pet owners will soon be able to get a dog ’s - eye - view of the world following the launch of a ' smart collar ' for animals			1
the @entity145 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a canine 's health , track its location and even allows owners to speak to their dog remotely			1
the device can also stream videos showing what pets are up to , using a state - of - the - art built - in camera			2
the gadget , created by @entity175 and video streaming developer @entity176 , uses @entity178 to send alerts to the owner 's smartphone , while they are away from their pets			0
the downside is that the dog will need a data package for the collar to work , although it does come with ones year 's @entity189 as part of the £ 131 ( $ 199 ) price tag .			0
