@entity0 have crashed out of the @entity1 after an agonising 2 - 0 defeat in @entity3			1
@entity0 should have had a half - time lead but @entity5 spurned a glorious chance when through on goal and that was the turning point as @entity9 and @entity10 struck for @entity11 to send @entity13 's side out			1
spurs now have to quickly turn their attention to sunday , to prepare for the @entity17 final against @entity18 at @entity19			0
host commentator thanks for joining me for the action in @entity3 this evening			0
@entity0 will certainly need to re-group ahead of facing @entity18 in the @entity17 final on sunday heartache for @entity0 , they are out ! @entity11 have won and are through to the @entity1 last 16			1
22 - year - old @entity10 has done his parent club @entity18 a real favour tonight			2
the winger , on loan in @entity3 , has been exceptional			0
i wonder if @entity33 boss @entity32 has been watching ... @entity0 keep losing possession as the lump the ball forward			2
it 's all very desperate now			0
@entity11 's side are a wall of purple as @entity0 continue to fail at breaking their stubborn resistance			1
@entity41 whips in a freekick and @entity5 's looping header just cruves over the bar			1
here is the picture @entity0 fans wo n't want to see - @entity10 doubling @entity11 's lead			1
@entity49 lets fire from long range but @entity52 makes a smart save to concede a corner @entity54 heads off for club legend @entity55 as the hosts try to run down the clock the @entity3 side are already time wasting by holding up the ball in the @entity0 corner as @entity0 struggle to obtain possession			1
it 's all @entity0 at the moment but the attacking play is very disjointed			0
@entity67 has the ball in the back of the net but @entity5 is offside before his cutback			1
@entity0 still require two goals			0
@entity41 wins a freekick just on the edge of the area but @entity49 once again hits the wall			1
@entity77 trudges off to be replaced by @entity78 @entity10 is booked for his exuberant celebration having ripped off his top during his sprint to the crowd spurs shoot themselves in the foot			1
an innocuous ball is n't dealt with by @entity0 and a one - two between @entity86 and @entity9 puts the @entity87 through on goal			1
he finishes past @entity90 and leaps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate			0
spurs on the brink ? it 's that man again - @entity96 is free 20 yards out but @entity11 waste another decent chance after his blazes well over the bar			1
@entity100 has put in a fine performance for the @entity103 side			0
here 's some of his latest acrobatics ! here we go , here come the cavalry			0
@entity67 and @entity41 come on for @entity0			1
@entity108 and @entity109 make way			0
@entity10 weaves his way through the @entity0 defence and finds himself in front of @entity90 but his weak shot is hit straight at the @entity116 stopper			1
unbelievable chance to double the lead			0
time for a change ? spurs are getting increasingly frustrated as @entity109 attempts an audacious cross field pass which goes out for a @entity11 goalkick ! @entity125 on , @entity124 off after the defender pulls up whilst making a clearance			2
@entity9 runs clear after a horror moment from @entity128			1
the centre back gives the ball away to @entity96 , who plays in the former @entity132 striker to sprint through and slot past @entity90			1
@entity0 manager @entity13 is becoming increasingly animated on the touchline , especially after a few decisions have gone against his side @entity96 is in the thick of the action			2
@entity10 steals the ball in the @entity0 penalty area and cuts it back for @entity96 but his effort from the middle of the box is straight at @entity90 @entity143 is booked for a robust tackle on @entity96			1
slightly harsh as seemed 50/50			0
@entity108 bursts down the left wing but his cross is too close to @entity52			0
massive 45 mins for @entity0 who begin the second - half			2
so whilst free - scoring @entity67 is on the bench and @entity5 has spurned a glorious chance , @entity13 's other striker @entity151 has posted on @entity152 a picture of him kicking back drinking from a coconut			1
a sustained period of pressure from @entity0 sees multiple crosses into the @entity11 box			2
nobody can latch onto a cross and it stays 0 - 0 at the break			0
that gives gives @entity0 45 minutes to find a desperately needed away goal to progress			2
a ball over the top sees @entity10 race through once again but his effort his flashed well over the @entity0 bar			1
here is the moment @entity5 should have scored for @entity0			2
ouch ! @entity9 out of nothing is clear by the @entity0 touchline , he cuts back inside but his shot is well blocked by @entity128			1
it ricochets off @entity128 's arm but a penalty would have been extremely harsh			0
free - kick for @entity0 ...			2
and specialist @entity49 smacks it into the wall			0
disappointing for the visitors but it 's all hands to the pump for @entity11 as the pressure continues to build on their goal			2
since @entity5 's shocker @entity0 have been well on top			2
it seems the hosts are giving @entity0 far too much respect and @entity13 's side are struggling to break down two banks of defence			0
@entity193 's @entity192 , who is at the @entity194 , sums it up well ... @entity5 is played straight through on goal as the @entity11 back - line is far too high			1
@entity5 is joined clear with @entity197 but the @entity199 's tame pass fails to find @entity197 and @entity52 is able to intercept and gather the ball			2
that 's a crucial waste from @entity5 , but how costly will it prove ? so far so good for @entity0			2
they 've managed to get into the game and keep @entity10 relatively quiet			0
however @entity13 does n't seem too thrilled on the touchline ... former @entity207 midfielder @entity206 enters the fray as @entity209 picks up a muscle injury almost immediately after @entity211 swings in a delightful ball from wide right which @entity214 has to clear with a last - ditch header			1
very promising spell for @entity0			0
spurs win a corner and from the clearance @entity219 unleashes from 20 yards but his effort is well blocked by @entity54			0
@entity108 loses possession wide on the left and a swift counter attack started by @entity225 sees @entity9 in on goal but he fails to find his feet and @entity143 just about manages to cover the danger and force a goal kick			1
the @entity230 are rapid on the break			0
spurs really need to close down @entity10			0
the winger finds volumes of space on the edge of @entity0 's area and is narrowly called back for offside			0
spurs were in trouble there well well , @entity0 have a penalty shout ! @entity214 ( a former @entity242 defender ) goes to ground and brings down @entity49 in the box			1
minimal if any contact with thew ball but referee @entity248 waves away some weak appeals			0
former @entity251 forward @entity250 volleys at goal from outside the box but it 's comfortably saved by @entity52 @entity10 is already imposing himself on the game with his pace			1
running down the left he wins a corner for the hosts but @entity90 does well to punch clear as i mentioned , talisman striker @entity67 is on the bench for @entity0 tonight			1
the @entity103 side have the first chance			0
@entity18 loanee @entity10 does well on the left to set up @entity96 but his 20 year strike goes wide of @entity90 ' post			1
their is a raucous atmosphere at the @entity194 and both sides have begun tentatively			0
focus will be needed tonight			0
kick - off has started another historic @entity272 night for @entity0 ... a strong @entity0 line - up is out on the pitch			0
just a reminder @entity13 's side must score after @entity11 's away goal at @entity278 last week			1
the @entity0 squad has been out on the @entity194 pitch for a quick warm up			2
they 'll play in front of 2,200 @entity0 fans who have sold out their allocation			0
@entity67 is supposedly rested for the @entity17 final against @entity18 on sunday			0
but will @entity0 need him later to rescue their @entity272 dream ? @entity11 substitutes : @entity125 , @entity206 , @entity55 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 @entity0 substitutes : @entity78 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity41 , @entity67 , @entity298 @entity0 manager @entity13 appears in high spirits ahead of kick - off here are the line - ups out in @entity230			1
