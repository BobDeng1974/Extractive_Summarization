for @entity0 , a 40 - year - old website designer from @entity2 's @entity1 , kicking back is a matter of saddling up			1
but her hobby is n't riding horses			0
instead , it 's becoming a replica of one , complete with a saddle , bridle and bit			1
@entity0 , who goes by the name of @entity13 when in her pony get - up , also likes to trot about pulling her friend @entity15 behind her in a custom - made trap			1
giddy up ! @entity0 , pictured with her friend @entity15 , spends her time off dressed up as a pony relaxing : @entity0 says her penchant for pony - style dressing helps her relax and come out of her shell but while it might sound bizarre , @entity0 is adamant that not only is it just a bit of fun , it takes her to a ' wonderful place ' where she can relax and truly be herself			1
when i 'm in the pony gear , i feel freer , ' she explains			2
' it 's about who you are , it 's about expressing yourself			2
' @entity0 , who has always been an animal lover , owns several real horses , as well as a cat named @entity35 , and says she sees her horses as equals			1
but when she becomes a horse herself , it is her friend @entity15 who takes the reins , leading her about and ' driving ' the trap just as she would with a real pony			1
' i steer by giving her commands via turns of the reins , ' she explains			0
' that 's a good method and she can respond to pressure on either side of her mouth , same as you would with a horse			2
' @entity15 also has an insight into why @entity0 loves becoming a pony so much , arguing that it is partly a way for her to overcome her crippling shyness			1
' she is a very introverted person , ' she explains			0
' but when she 's in that zone , she 's another person			2
i think it 's a way of expressing another large part 0f her personality			2
that 's very much her identity			2
' ' it is very understandable that a shy person might love animal play , ' comments sexologist and sociologist , dr @entity66			0
' taking on a new identity or even just new garments can take you out of the cage of your own shyness			0
passion : @entity0 , who says she has always had pets , owns several real horses of her own unusual : @entity0 goes for a trot , pulling her custom - made trap with her friend grace holding the reins ' there 's something about the way she must feel in her pony finery with her mane and her tail and her ears and her beautiful bridle , the whole nine yards , that liberates her and gives her a more fabulous field in which to gallop			1
' and @entity0 certainly is n't shy about getting out and about in her pony ensemble , despite the full look including a rather revealing rubber jumpsuit			1
from a trip to the shops , a gallop around the yard or even a day out at the races , nowhere is off limits for @entity0 's pony persona			1
but although she does get the odd strange look , @entity0 says the overwhelming reaction to her unusual look is a positive one			1
equals : @entity0 says she sees horses and ponies as her equals rather than as animals passion : @entity0 is so comfortable in her pony ensemble , she has even worn it to go to the races ' i think when the world looks at me as a pony , they see something that makes them think " @entity120 , that 's amazing " , ' she says			1
but regardless of what people think of her look , the real attraction for @entity0 is the sense of peace she gets from her pony alter - ego			1
for me , it 's spiritual , ' she says			2
' it 's a different realm			2
you 're not worried about bills , you 're not worried about going to work			0
' i become freer , i 'm me			0
i 'm very introverted and i do express through being a pony girl			0
and that 's a wonderful place to be for somebody			0
that 's a great place to be			0
' unfortunately , however , transforming into a pony does n't come cheap with each of @entity0 's ensembles costing between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000			1
worth a try : @entity0 says she would like to see other people giving pony play a try also expensive is the makeover currently underway in her back garden , which will eventually boast a set of human - sized stables and a sand - floored school			1
' it 's something to spend my money on , ' she shrugs			0
expensive though it might be , @entity0 hopes that more people will give pony play a try - even if it means wearing an uncomfortable - looking bit			1
' once the bit 's in , the tongue is out so you 're not speaking , ' she explains			0
' if you drool while wearing a bit , you 've got to be wearing the wrong - size bit			0
' nevertheless , she adds , being in pony mode can take you to some ' wonderful places '			0
' i get up , go to work but i just choose to escape sometimes , ' she adds			0
' i think more people should experience it			0
and if it 's not fun , you 're not doing it right ! '			0
