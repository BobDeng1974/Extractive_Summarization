by @entity0 published : 17:27 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 17:45 est , 21 october 2013 apology : @entity3 @entity2 had billed the taxpayer £ 700 for the rides a whistleblower arrested after revealing the excessive expenses of a @entity8 has been told she will not face criminal charges because what she did was ‘ in the public interest ’			1
but the police worker , aged 50 , who has been suspended from work for five months , still faces disciplinary procedures to determine whether she can keep her job			1
she was arrested after a local newspaper published details of two chauffeur - driven trips taken by @entity3 @entity2			1
he had billed the taxpayer £ 700 for the rides – and it was only after the disclosure that he apologised and said he would pay the money back			1
despite this , the woman was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and a breach of the data protection act			0
those found guilty of these offences commonly draw prison sentences of a year or more			0
yesterday , prosecutors announced they were dropping the case because any alleged leak would have been ‘ in the public interest ’			0
@entity39 lawyer @entity38 said : ‘ to rely on this defence , an individual is required to establish on the balance of probabilities that the disclosure was in the public interest			0
investigation : the newspaper that was alerted , the @entity47 ( whose offices are pictured ) , called mr @entity2 's office to check the details of his expenses ‘ in my view , given the nature and circumstances of the disclosure , the suspect would be in a position to do so and , therefore , there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction			2
’ charges against a further person accused of helping to facilitate the leak have already been dropped			0
another person who was accused of perverting the course of justice will also escape prosecution			0
the scandal broke in april after mr @entity2 spent £ 700 going to two dinners in the county in a hired @entity74 with a driver			1
the trips cost the taxpayer £ 385 and £ 313			1
mr @entity2 has always maintained he did not realise how much the trips had cost and decided to pay the money back once he was told			1
he has said that in the future he would use his £ 23,000 @entity81 crossover – another taxpayer - funded perk			1
mps from all parties have condemned the police inquiry that followed after the newspaper that was alerted , the @entity47 , called mr @entity2 ’s office to check the details of his expenses			1
happy : mp @entity90 said the news vindicates ' that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals ' yesterday @entity94 mp @entity90 said : ‘ this is good news and vindicates what i and others have been saying for months – that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals			2
' the police have spent a huge amount of money and time on this investigation while disrupting the lives and careers of a number of people with arrests			2
’ ' this is good news and vindicates what i and others have been saying for months – that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals ' @entity90 , @entity94 mp he added that ‘ questions should be asked about why the force spent so much time and resources ’ on the case			2
@entity119 county councillor @entity118 , who is on the police and crime panel which is supposed to scrutinise the actions of the commissioner , said she would be raising the ‘ disproportionate ’ actions of the police at the next meeting			0
she added : ‘ we have had conflicting statements about the involvement of the commissioner and his staff in these investigations			0
’ a spokesman for @entity134 said its ‘ staff and police officers have a duty to protect and manage the information they have privileged access to			0
any allegations relating to a breach of this position need to be investigated ’ .			0
