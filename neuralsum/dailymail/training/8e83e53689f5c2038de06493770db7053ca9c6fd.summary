the @entity0 has postponed its plan to issue the @entity3 's anti-capitalist protesters with legal notices requiring them to leave their tent city			1
the @entity6 confirmed it had suspended legal action against demonstrators until the morning , when the situation will be reviewed			1
a spokesman said : ' we have not handed them ( the protesters ) a letter this afternoon			1
' earlier a spokesman for @entity3 's said the cathedral was not taking joint action with the @entity6			1
men ( and women ) at work : protesters on the steps of @entity3 's unfurled a banner on the steps of @entity25 painting their action as essential improvements reprieve : protesters were due to be served with legal notices today by the @entity6 , but it is now scheduled to happen in the morning ' @entity32 met yesterday following the resignation of the @entity34 and are due to meet with the @entity35 today , ' the spokesman said			1
' the chapter have not yet sought an injunction , nor are they serving notices on the protesters today			1
' they are committed to a peaceful resolution at all costs			0
' there were fears today that a split among senior @entity46 figures on how to deal with the protest could lead to the camp remaining on the steps of @entity3 's during next year 's @entity50 and the @entity52 celebrations			1
concerns that legal action could lead to violent evictions has led to the @entity46 's liberal wing - led by archbishop @entity56 - to oppose moves to support the @entity6 's plans			1
the split could mean that some protesters would be moved from the @entity0 's land but could be allowed to remain in the shadow of @entity3 's indefinitely			1
authorities were given a possible foretaste of any eviction they may be forced to carry out in the early hours of this morning when police arrested 12 protesters outside @entity68			2
they were among a group of up to 200 demonstrators who are opposed plans to criminalise the act of squatting homes and other building			0
a protester lies before three policemen in @entity68 during the demonstration against plans to criminalise squatting last night the archbishop of @entity82 broke his silence on the protesters camped outside @entity25 , saying he sympathised with the ' urgent larger issues ' they raised			1
in a sign of the panic within the @entity46 high command since the arrival of the activists , dr @entity56 intervened yesterday after the dean of the cathedral became the third member of staff to resign			1
indicating his support for the anti-capitalists ' aims , the @entity81 said : ' the urgent larger issues raised by the protesters at @entity3 's remain very much on the table			2
archbishop : dr @entity56 has kept his counsel since the protest began but , after the resignation of @entity106 , @entity107 , he has spoken and backed the demonstrators ' we need – as a @entity46 and as society as a whole – to work to make sure that they are properly addressed			1
' the archbishop 's intervention was sparked by the resignation yesterday of the @entity106 , the right reverend @entity107			1
the dean caused controversy when he closed the historic building 's doors last month for the first time since the @entity121 , citing ' health and safety concerns ' over the tents			0
the cathedral reopened last week but the dean said yesterday his position had become ' untenable ' amid the ongoing row			2
the archbishop 's endorsement of the right of the protesters to campaign showed just how confused the @entity46 remains in its response to the encampment on its doorstep			1
his remarks came as the @entity35 , @entity136 , confirmed yesterday that legal efforts to persuade the activists to leave have begun			2
stepping down : the @entity106 , the @entity139 @entity107 , pictured yesterday speaking to demonstrators camped outside the @entity25 , has resigned ' @entity141 ' : @entity142 became the second of the cathedral 's senior clergy to resign in less than a week trouble brewing : the @entity35 ( centre ) and a protestor in the tea tent yesterday the bishop stressed that cathedral officials did not want a violent eviction			1
the dean 's departure followed @entity155 of @entity3 's , @entity156 – who had told police to leave the activists alone after their arrival on october 15 – and part - time chaplain @entity160			1
the @entity162 protesters were showing no signs of leaving despite the cathedral 's requests			1
dr @entity56 said the dean 's departure was ' very sad news '			0
he added : ' the events of the last couple of weeks have shown very clearly how decisions made in good faith by good people under unusual pressure can have utterly unforeseen and unwelcome consequences , and the clergy of @entity3 's deserve our understanding			0
@entity107 will be much missed			1
' ' move beyond slogans ' : the @entity35 has criticised demonstrators ' methods an unlikely crowd : a demonstrator directs questions to @entity186 ( second from right ) , and the @entity35 , @entity136 ( right ) at the weekend crowd : the bishop and dean addressed a crowd of hundreds by the steps of @entity3 's yesterday a significant protester splinter group refused even to support the cathedral 's requests for drink , drugs and loud music to be banned from the protest camp			1
they appeared largely bemused by the resignation of the dean – which he had to yesterday submit to the @entity203 , since his job is a crown appointment			0
their reluctance to leave was indicated by placards saying ' hell no we wo n't go ' and ' @entity210 did not quit – he drove the money lenders from the temple '			2
the government is considering whether the law needs to be tightened to deal with protests such as that being held outside @entity25			0
justice minister @entity217 said everyone had a right to ' make their views known '			0
but he insisted it was not right to ' disrupt the life of the community ' by setting up encampments			0
' everybody agrees there should be a right of peaceful protest in our country , ' mr @entity217 told the @entity233 's @entity232			2
' people have an entitlement to make their view known			0
it 's fundamental to our democracy and the coalition is committed to protect that			0
' but we saw - for instance in @entity68 , where there was a permanent encampment which had gone on for years there and was very disruptive to the enjoyment of @entity68 by others			0
' you can not protest peacefully at @entity68 because it is closed off to others			2
we are taking action to deal with that			2
' and if necessary we will take action to deal with other invasions of private property that involved permanent encampments			2
' he went on : ' we want to protect peaceful protest			2
we do not think that it 's right to disrupt the life of the community , and trespass , and permanently to set up and live somewhere - just as travellers do - which invades private property			0
' in a statement mr @entity107 , the dean for four years , said : ' since the arrival of the protesters ' camp outside the cathedral , we have all been put under a great deal of strain and have faced what would appear to be some insurmountable issues			1
' it has become increasingly clear to me that , as criticism of the cathedral has mounted in the press , media and in public opinion , my position as dean of @entity278 was becoming untenable			2
' in order to give the opportunity for a fresh approach to the complex and vital questions facing @entity3 's , i have thought it best to stand down as dean , to allow new leadership to be exercised			0
' @entity3 's spokesman the right reverend @entity292 said : ' we are committed to doing all we can to find a way ahead that ensures the main message of the protest is not only heard but properly attended to , and in such a way that people in the local community , as well as our own team , can do their work peacefully for the good of everyone			0
' the @entity35 explained that due to the ' great mystery ' of the @entity46 's organisation , the cathedral made its own decisions without control from him			1
but he said @entity3 's officials had asked him to help out in the protesters ' row			0
he went on : ' there are many diverse voices in the camp outside @entity3 's , but among them , serious issues are being articulated which the cathedral has always sought to address			0
' the bishop stressed that all in the church wanted a peaceful resolution , but added said that any responsible organisation had to investigate its legal powers			0
outside , the camp still numbers about 200 tents – but barely 50 protesters attended a meeting yesterday afternoon to decide tactics			0
about a quarter of those present indicated that they were reluctant to accept basic requests from the cathedral for drink and drugs to be barred from the site and the camp to be kept tidy			0
in a statement , the group , whose official name is @entity162 , said : ' the management of @entity25 is obviously deeply divided over the position they have taken in response to our cause – but our cause has never been directed at the staff of the cathedral			0
' the real issue was ' challenging the unsustainable financial system that punishes the many and privileges the few ' , it added .			0

split at top of the @entity46 could lead to protesters remaining during @entity358 and @entity52 celebrations
