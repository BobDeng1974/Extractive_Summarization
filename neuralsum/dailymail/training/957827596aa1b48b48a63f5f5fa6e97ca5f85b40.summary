@entity1 doctors have successfully brought three dead hearts back to life and transplanted them into patients in a world - first operation			1
the doctors at @entity8 in @entity9 used a preservation solution developed with the @entity11 to transplant the organs into 57 - year - old @entity13 , 44 - year - old @entity14 and a third patient still in recovery			1
one of the hearts had stopped beating for 20 minutes before it was brought back to life , placed on a machine and injected with the preservation solution			1
before these operations , heart surgeons have only been able to use donor hearts from 100 percent brain - dead patients , but now the donor pool will be expanded significantly			1
the solution , which took 12 years to develop , also improves the function of the hearts donated after circulatory death ( @entity50 ) when they are restarted			1
ms @entity13 , who is retired and lives in @entity51 in southwest @entity9 , said she is a ' different person altogether ' after receiving her transplant			1
' i had the transplant a couple of months ago and i was very sick before i had it , ' she said			0
' now i feel wonderful			0
i walk three kilometres a day			0
' mr @entity14 , a father of three girls including an eight - year - old and six - year - old twins , worked as a carpenter and lives on the @entity61 with his daughters and wife @entity23			1
he is still recovering at the hospital			2
' i feel amazing , ' he said			0
' i have to say i never thought i 'd feel so privileged to wear the @entity65 's pyjamas			0
doctors at @entity8 in @entity9 used a heart - resuscitation console and preservation solution developed in @entity1 to transplant dead hearts into patients ms @entity71 ( centre ) said she is a ' different person altogether ' after receiving her transplant ' i 'm just looking forward to getting back out into the real world			1
' mr @entity14 said he often thinks about his donor			0
' i do think about it , because without the donor i might not be here , ' he said			0
' i 'm not religious or spiritual but it 's a wild thing to get your head around			0
' previously , surgeons were only able to use hearts from donor patients who were 100 per cent brain dead			1
these patients ' hearts are kept alive and beating by life support machines and are able to be removed from the donor patient and placed straight into a @entity93 machine which keeps the heart pumping , with minimal damage to the organ			1
but the new solution allows transplants using hearts from 90 - 95 percent brain dead patients , which were previously thought to be too damaged to use			1
when a 90 - 95 percent brain - dead patient 's life support is switched off , the heart gradually stops beating over a period of about 20 minutes			1
under @entity1 law , surgeons must wait until there has been no heartbeat for five minutes before the organ can be removed			2
the lack of oxygen during this time causes significant damage to the heart and until now has meant those hearts could not be used for transplants			1
but when the new solution is injected into the heart its cells start to regenerate			2
one of the surgeons who performed the operations , dr @entity124 , said the technology would have implications for transplant units around the world			1
dr @entity129 , ms @entity13 , @entity131 health minister @entity130 , mr @entity14 and prof @entity132 at @entity8 on friday medical staff transporting a heart in a heart - resuscitation console developed by doctors at @entity8 and researchers at the @entity11 ' @entity139 and @entity140 are very envious that we were able to get on and do this , ' dr @entity124 told @entity143			1
' many prestigious units around the world have been working towards this and have n't been able to pull it off			2
' it literally is a world first , it means a lot for the transplant world			2
' dr @entity124 said the technology was approved in the last year and since then three patients have successfully received transplants			2
' we did one yesterday , one about two weeks ago and the first one was about nine weeks ago , ' he said			0
' hopefully we will do many more , this technology will only get better and will only be able to expand on the limitations			0
' prof @entity132 , the director of the @entity160 's @entity159 , said the team had been working on this project for 20 years and intensively for the past four			0
' we 've been researching to see how long the heart can sustain this period in which it has stopped beating , ' he said			0
' we then developed a technique for reactivating the heart in a so - called heart in a box machine			2
' to do that we removed blood from the donor to prime the machine and then we take the heart out , connect it to the machine , warm it up and then it starts to beat			0
' the donor hearts were each housed in this machine for about four hours before transplantation , he said			0
' based on the performance of the heart on the machine we can then tell quite reliably whether this heart will work if we then go and transplant it			0
' in many respects this breakthrough represents a major inroad to reducing the shortage of donor organs , ' he said .			0

doctors at @entity8 in @entity9 conduct world - first transplants
surgeons successfully brought three dead hearts back to life
the transplants were made possible using a preservation solution developed with the @entity11
the hospital believes 30 percent more lives will be able to be saved
