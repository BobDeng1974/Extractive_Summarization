by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:58 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 02:31 est , 16 july 2013 ' @entity3 ' : prosecutors say the the trial of former @entity7 bond trader @entity6 , pictured , was about ' @entity9 greed ' the former @entity7 bond trader known as ‘ @entity3 ’ who allegedly sold $ 1 billion in toxic mortgage investments deliberately designed to fail in the @entity15 housing market crash epitomized ' @entity9 greed ' , the court heard today			1
the @entity16 has accused @entity6 , a party lover who claimed to be from a prominent @entity18 family , of misleading investors in a mortgage investment called @entity7 by not telling them that a hedge fund was involved in selecting the underlying assets and betting against it			1
@entity16 lawyer @entity24 told the jury in the trial , which kicked off today in @entity27 , the deal @entity6 put together was ' secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail ' to the benefit of the hedge fund , which made about $ 1 billion			1
' in the end , @entity9 greed drove mr. @entity6 to lie and deceive , ' @entity24 said			1
but @entity34 , a lawyer for @entity6 , countered that the @entity16 was trying to turn her client into a ' scapegoat '			2
' this is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove of @entity9 , ' she said			2
the trial , scheduled to last three weeks , stems from a lawsuit the @entity16 filed against @entity7 and @entity6 in 2010			1
@entity6 , who is no longer with @entity7 and is earning a doctorate in economics at the @entity44 , is on trial alone after @entity7 agreed to pay a $ 550 million settlement in july 2010			1
under fire : former @entity7 executive @entity6 , pictured , trying to dodge the media scrum as he enters @entity50 federal court on the first day of his trial in @entity27 @entity6 , wearing a black suit and orange tie , sat with his counsel as the lawyers made their opening arguments			1
he did not speak during monday 's proceedings , although he is expected to testify later in the trial			2
the @entity16 contends @entity6 , at the time a vice president at @entity7 , failed to disclose that @entity60 , the hedge fund run by billionaire @entity62 , was involved in picking mortgage securities tied to the @entity7 investment and that it was also shorting , or betting against , it			1
@entity24 said @entity6 , the principal @entity7 employee involved in the @entity7 deal , had a duty to be truthful with investors			1
instead , he hid ' critical information ' in order to get them to buy in			0
@entity6 also misled @entity72 , a third - party firm ostensibly brought in to select the securities included in the @entity74 , into believing that @entity62 was an equity investor in @entity7 rather than taking a short position , @entity24 said			1
the @entity16 contends @entity72 would not have participated had it known @entity62 was betting against the investment			0
a different firm decided not to participate as @entity72 's portfolio selection agent when @entity6 told it @entity62 was going short , @entity24 said			2
' his solution was trickery and half - truths , ' he said			0
' his solution was securities fraud			0
' ' innocent ' : lawyers for @entity6 , left , say the former @entity7 trader did not mislead investors @entity24 also displayed a much - cited email sent on january 23 , 2007 , by @entity6 to his girlfriend at the time , saying of the financial markets that the ' whole building is about to collapse anytime now '			1
' only potential survivor , the fabulous @entity3 ... standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities ! ! ! ' the email said			0
investors lost more than $ 1 billion after almost all the securities tied to the transaction were downgraded , the @entity16 says			1
@entity62 earned about the same amount thanks to his bet , the @entity16 says			0
@entity7 made $ 15 million in fees on the deal , @entity24 said			2
@entity34 , @entity6 's lawyer , countered in her own opening arguments that her client had not misled investors or @entity72			1
she said @entity72 knew at the time that @entity62 was widely reported to be engaged in an aggressive bet against the @entity15 housing market after setting up two funds to short subprime investments in 2006			0
' @entity72 knew @entity62 took the opposite view , ' she said			0
bourgeoisie : @entity6 reportedly ' loved to party ' and claimed to be from a prominent @entity18 family @entity72 , not @entity62 , picked the securities tied to @entity7 , she said , adding that @entity72 rejected dozens of securities that @entity62 wanted included and ran a sophisticated computer analysis before signing off on them			1
it was standard for a firm such as @entity72 to take input from investors in selecting securities for a @entity74 , @entity34 said			0
in the case of a deal such as @entity7 , known as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation , it would be usual to consult both long and short investors , which by design have both long and short investors involved			2
' the decision here was made by @entity72 , ' she said			0
' the selection here was made by @entity72			0
' as for @entity6 's email to his girlfriend , @entity34 said it was irrelevant , calling it ' an old fashioned love letter ' and noting it was referencing a @entity145 article , which he attached			1
' i know two to three weeks from now you will find he did nothing wrong , ' @entity34 said			0
the jury was also selected today , with the court picking five women and four men as jurors out of a pool of 48 people			2
they include a retired special education teacher , a former retail broker now teaching art history , a recent medical school graduate and an @entity162 priest			0
@entity15 district judge @entity163 excused some potential jurors after they said they had views about @entity9 or the role of banks in the financial crisis			2
the first juror to be excused said he had ' a fairly jaundiced view of @entity9			0
' @entity171 also quizzed jurors on whether they had ever heard of @entity7 , @entity6 or his nickname , ' @entity3 '			1
at the start of the trial , @entity171 warned the lawyers on both sides to ' have a heart ' and be mindful many jurors would not know the financial jargon expected to be used at trial			2
among the words or phrases she singled out were ' asset - backed ' , ' short ' , ' security ' , ' flip book ' and ' swap '			0
she also cited the term ' trading desk ' , saying ' mere mortals do n't know what a trading desk is			0
' ' do not assume people know what investment bankers do , ' @entity171 added .			0
