by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 4 march 2013 a father - of - two almost died after @entity3 staff gave him the wrong medicine			2
@entity5 , 38 , who had a chest infection , was wrongly given diabetic medication instead of steroids for asthma by his local @entity3			1
although the sticker on the packet detailed the medication mr @entity5 was supposed to have the tablets inside were the wrong kind			1
the sticker on the tablets he had been given had the details for the steroids mr @entity5 should have been given mr @entity5 , who has three - year - old twin daughters , had to be rushed to hospital twice after he took the drugs and felt unwell			1
it was only when mr @entity5 ' wife @entity21 researched the name ' @entity22 ' that was on the packet it was realised the medication was a hypoglycaemic anti-diabetic drug			1
doctors told him that if his wife had not been vigilant and got him to hospital on the second occasion he could have gone into a diabetic coma and died			2
mr @entity5 , an it systems officer at the @entity32 , said : ' the medication had been checked twice by members of staff at the pharmacy but they still got it completely wrong			1
if his wife @entity21 had n't researched the name @entity22 they would n't have found out why he was taking sick ' i felt horrendous but just thought it was a side effect of the steroids			2
i had no idea i had actually been taking the wrong medication			2
' i am really angry about what happened and how serious it could have been			0
' the nurse and the doctor at hospital said it was very serious what had happened to me and that i was basically going into a diabetic coma			2
' if my wife had n't noticed and i had been left overnight , i could have been killed			0
' mr @entity5 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , visited his gp with a chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics and steroids			1
he had been given 30 @entity22 pills instead of 30 @entity63 tablets			0
after collecting his prescription from the nearby pharmacy that evening he took six steroid tablets as instructed the following morning			0
he began feeling unwell within a few hours and suffered an asthma attack			0
he was taken by ambulance to @entity69 and released later that evening			0
the next day he took his antibiotics and another six steroid tablets as instructed but again started to feel poorly			0
mrs @entity72 checked the medication and discovered the box and drugs inside were actually for diabetics - even though the printed label stuck on the box contained the details for the correct medication			2
he was rushed back to hospital and put on an iv glucose drip before spending the night on the acute medical ward while doctors corrected his sugar levels			1
mr @entity5 said he was lucky his wife noticed he had been taking the wrong drugs or he could have died			1
the @entity3 in @entity55 that made the blunder			2
mr @entity5 is lucky that his wife spotted the mistake he added : ' my wife 's grandfather was diabetic so when she got home from work and saw how ill i was after the second time of taking them she looked at the medication and realised the mistake			1
' i was feeling very ill and i was just sprawled out on the sofa and very spaced out			0
i 'm incredibly lucky my wife noticed the mistake when she did otherwise i might not be here today			0
' i 'm absolutely disgusted by it to be honest			0
the package was signed by two different people so it was n't just one person 's mistake			0
' there is no way i will be going back to that pharmacy again			0
' mr @entity5 was contacted by the pharmacy and offered an apology			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' we take the health of our patients very seriously and are extremely sorry that mr @entity5 was given the incorrect prescription medication			1
' we have stringent standard operating procedures and a full investigation has taken place into the circumstances surrounding the incident			0
' we will shortly share the findings of our investigation with mr @entity5 and have been in contact to apologise for any distress caused			1
