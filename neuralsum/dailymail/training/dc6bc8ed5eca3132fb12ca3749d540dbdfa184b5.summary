a year has elapsed since a photograph of @entity1 in his underpants triggered questions about his long - term future at @entity5			1
in that time , there has been a @entity8 triumph , a @entity10 tournament , a broken ankle , a new £ 80,000 - a - week contract and , on sunday , two goals against @entity14 as the @entity16 holders eased into the quarter - finals			1
suddenly it is hard to imagine @entity5 without @entity1 ’s towering presence , the focal point for all the creative forces who swirl around him			1
@entity1 scores the opening goal of the @entity16 match at the @entity25 between @entity5 and @entity14 the ball finds its way into the back of the net as @entity1 gives @entity5 a 1 - 0 lead over @entity14 at the @entity25 @entity1 celebrates as @entity5 take the lead against @entity32 club @entity14 in the @entity16 tie @entity1 celebrates making it 1 - 0 with @entity35 and his @entity5 team - mates at the @entity25 on sunday @entity1 makes it 2 - 0 two minutes later as @entity5 take a comfortable lead over their @entity32 opposition in the @entity16 the ball lifts over @entity14 goalkeeper @entity41 as @entity1 doubles @entity5 's lead with his second goal in as many minutes @entity1 celebrates his side 's second goal as @entity5 comfortably saw off @entity14 in the @entity16 at the @entity25 @entity1 scored both @entity5 's goals in the first half as they went in 2 - 0 ahead in the @entity16 match @entity5 : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity35 ( @entity56 72 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 72 ) , @entity1 ( @entity60 83 ) subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 goals : @entity1 ( 27 , 29 ) bookings : @entity68 @entity14 : @entity41 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ( @entity77 54 ) , @entity78 ( reach 54 ) , @entity79 subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 bookings : @entity77 referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) @entity90 applauded the @entity92 striker for his progress since he arrived from @entity94			1
‘ he understands now what top - level football demands , ’ said @entity90			2
‘ he has improved on his mobility and his technical quality and , of course , his body is very strong and he uses it well			0
’ @entity1 flirted with a return to @entity92 after revelations that he invited a model into the team hotel on the eve of a game last february			2
he was then dropped for the @entity110 game against @entity111 in favour of @entity113			0
but @entity1 celebrated the anniversary of his indiscretion by proving his mind is firmly on his game these days			2
he proved to be the difference in what might have been an awkward @entity16 fifth - round tie , scoring two wonderful goals inside 135 first - half seconds			1
the first was a clinical finale to a long period of possession in which every @entity5 player touched the ball , starting with a roll - out from goalkeeper @entity49 to @entity130 centre half @entity51 , who was making his debut			1
this passage of play wound up on the left wing , where @entity53 whipped over a low cross which @entity1 was first to reach , thumping his effort close to the goalkeeper but with enough power to beat @entity41			1
the second was a brilliant piece of swift thinking from @entity35 , who took a quick corner and supplied the perfect cross			2
@entity1 was the only other player alive to the opportunity and he converted with a fabulous volley , swept past @entity41 with his left boot			2
@entity90 said : ‘ it was a consequence of intelligence and technique from two players who responded quickly to a situation			0
’ with it , @entity1 moved into double figures , a healthy goal return for a campaign in which he has missed three months after breaking an ankle in august			1
@entity58 misses a chance during the @entity16 tie at the @entity25 on sunday against @entity14 @entity58 's chance goes wide as the lead remains 2 - 0 at the @entity25 to @entity5 over @entity14 @entity58 misses his chance to make it 3 - 0 at the @entity25 between @entity5 and @entity14 on sunday afternoon here 's how @entity1 scored for @entity5 as @entity14 's defence were caught napping on sunday in the @entity16 tie the @entity16 sixth - round draw will be made at 7.35pm on monday , before kick - off in @entity167 's fifth - round tie with @entity168			1
@entity169 ( @entity170 : 5/2 ) 2			2
@entity5 ( 13/8 ) 3			1
@entity171 ( 16/1 ) 4			0
@entity172 ( 10/1 ) 5			0
@entity173 ( 66/1 ) 6			0
@entity174 ( 28/1 ) 7			0
@entity175 ( 33/1 ) 8			0
@entity167 ( 150/1 ) or @entity168 ( 3/1 ) his goals also punched the fight from @entity179 ’s in - form @entity32 side			1
@entity14 may have beaten @entity182 champions @entity181 in the previous round but they never had @entity5 in trouble			1
the visitors seemed to accept their fate and focus on the quest for promotion			0
five thousand headed back to @entity189 singing their manager ’s name , although he was less satisfied			0
‘ i am disappointed , ’ said @entity179			0
‘ everybody was expecting another game like we played against @entity169 or @entity181 and this is my biggest concern			0
we did n’t go out on to the pitch as we usually go			0
‘ the second half was better but in the first half i did n’t like anything			0
it is difficult to beat teams like @entity5 if we make mistakes like we made on the second goal			1
if you want to take something here , you have to be perfect , as we were at the @entity209			0
‘ the cups are finished for us			0
now we must forget everything about them and work hard for two or three months if we want to play here next season			0
’ @entity49 barely had a save to make , returning to the team for @entity16 duty having lost his position as no 1 after errors at @entity219 on @entity220			2
@entity90 likes his back - up goalkeeper to play in the @entity16 , and this offers @entity49 a far better chance of wrapping his gloves around silverware than @entity226			1
@entity57 has a shot on goal during the @entity16 match between @entity5 and @entity14 at the @entity25 @entity5 manager @entity90 pictured during their @entity16 win over @entity32 outfit @entity14 @entity90 and his men avoided a @entity16 upset against @entity32 opposition by seeing off @entity14 on sunday @entity49 played for just the second time since @entity220 at @entity219 when he was caught smoking in the dressing room all the @entity236 had to do to repel @entity14 was organise his area and make a routine save from @entity239 in the first half			1
another effort from @entity75 flashed wide near the end and @entity243 headed against a post			0
the pick of several fine saves from @entity14 ’s @entity247 came in the second half , when he produced a brilliant reaction to turn away a header from @entity35			1
@entity5 will hope for a home tie in monday ’s draw having won their last nine at the @entity25			1
having waited nine years to get his hands on a major trophy , @entity90 is not going to release his grip on the @entity16 easily			2
@entity5 's @entity35 gets a head to the ball as he tries to make it 3 - 0 at the @entity25 against @entity14 @entity5 's @entity35 ( second from right ) glances a header towards goal as he tries to make it 3 - 0 to the home side @entity14 goalkeeper @entity41 makes an incredible save from a header by @entity5 's @entity35 during the @entity16 tie @entity35 reacts after missing the chance during the @entity16 tie as he failed to score against @entity14 @entity35 sticks his tongue out after failing to score during the @entity16 match and the @entity5 forward was later substituted @entity179 , manager of @entity14 , looks on during their @entity16 fifth round match defeat at the @entity25 against @entity5 @entity273 waves to the crowd after making his debut for @entity90 's side in the comfortable 2 - 0 win over @entity14 all 11 @entity5 players were involved in @entity1 's opening goal ( pictured )			1
