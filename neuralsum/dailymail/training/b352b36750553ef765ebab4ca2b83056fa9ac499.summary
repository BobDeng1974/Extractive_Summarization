by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 18:48 est , 21 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:51 est , 21 december 2013 @entity4 , @entity4 , @entity4 : @entity7 ceo @entity6 's looks may be one explanation as to why her career has been so successful in @entity6 's first year as the head of @entity7 , the company saw a stock price boost of 74.6 per cent			1
while some may point to @entity16 's leadership skills or many years at rival @entity17 as reasons for the company ' s recent boom , there 's always another explanation to consider : her looks			0
ever since @entity24 lost to @entity25 in their televised presidential debates , scholars have been pondering whether attraction has something to do with success - an academic field of study called @entity31			1
the @entity32 references a working paper released by researchers at the @entity35 last month which seems to bolster the idea that pretty people have it easier.the @entity39 researchers studied the 677 ceos of @entity42 companies , and how stock prices were impacted for the five days after their appointments were announced			1
the ceo 's headshots were run through a program that calculates attraction based on seventeen facial criteria , and for each point of attraction on a ten - point scale , the @entity40 ' companies noticed a once per cent boost in stock price			1
those results seem to confirm an earlier study published in 1994 by @entity56 - the father of pulchrinomics - and economist @entity59			0
skyrocketed : in the year after @entity16 's appointment to the position of ceo at @entity7 , prices in the company went up 74.6 per cent			0
scholars of @entity31 would say her attractiveness helped boost the company 's stock value for the 1994 study , @entity56 and @entity59 evaluated data on thousands of @entity72 and @entity73 workers from the late 1970s			2
each worker was given an attraction rating , and researchers found that workers who were rated above average for attraction earned a five per cent premium over just average - rated workers			1
that difference translated to the average - rated workers who made 10 per cent more than the below - average attractive workers			2
researchers also discovered that the above - average attractive workers tended to have jobs which capitalized off their looks in some way			2
pretty people win : ever since @entity24 ' lost ' to @entity25 in the 1960 televised presidential debates , scholars have been wondering about the connection between attractiveness and success the problem with beautiful people making more money is that it goes against the @entity72 idea that all you need to do is work hard to achieve success			0
but that 's still true in one important way			0
while @entity56 believes attraction does have a positive impact on earnings , there 's still one great equalizer that trumps a pretty face : education			2
@entity56 says that ' each additional year of education represents a ten per cent increase in earning potential '			0
it 's true - those with a master 's degree earn on average 400,000 more in a lifetime than those with just a bachelor 's degree			1
so if you 're not a looker , just keep your head in the books .			0

a new working paper released last month found that @entity42 companies with attractive @entity40 did better on the stock *market*
attraction stops being a figure in success with *post-graduate* degrees
those with a master 's earn on average *$* 400,000 more in a lifetime than those with just a bachelor 's degree
