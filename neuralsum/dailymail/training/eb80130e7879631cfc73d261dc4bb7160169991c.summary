' they also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up			0
life sentence : the white - and - brown pit bull will live out his days in an animal shelter without the possibility of ever being put up for adoption judge @entity155 said several people shared some responsibility for the attack			1
the judge pointed out that there was a ' @entity162 ' sign on the property 's fence but the gate was left open and children were allowed to play near the dog			2
