by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor and @entity2 his fellow ministers were wrestling with the @entity5 plane crash crisis and the escalating violence in the @entity7			1
but @entity8 left the worries of the world behind yesterday – to spend three hours baking and drinking shots of tequila on daytime television			1
as the @entity16 emergency committee met to discuss @entity17 , the deputy prime minister was on @entity19 ’s @entity18 with minor celebrities including @entity21 of reality show made in @entity23 and @entity25 contestant @entity24			1
drinking : @entity8 ( left ) enjoyed a ' @entity27 cocktail ' and three shots of tequila with @entity30 ( centre ) and @entity32 ( right ) on @entity19 's @entity18 down it goes : the deputy prime minister was criticised for appearing on the show while @entity37 victims of the missile attack in @entity5 have yet to be recovered he was treated to a tequila tasting , in which he sipped three varieties of the fiery @entity42 spirit well before lunchtime , pronouncing one to be ‘ very smooth ’ and another ‘ peppery ’			1
in another segment , the @entity45 leader was taught how to make an avocado cake , and discussed his free school meals policy while mixing and whisking the ingredients in a bowl			1
this was followed up with more booze – a ‘ @entity27 cocktail ’ of ingredients from 71 countries , which mr @entity8 said was ‘ not bad at all ’			2
he also named his favourite vinegar – balsamic – and shared a tray of empanada , a @entity62 speciality cooked by his wife @entity63 and carrying the words ‘ @entity18 ’ in dough			1
@entity63 had done most of the work , he said , adding : ‘ i assisted throughout			2
i brushed the thing with egg and chopped and diced			0
’ but his efforts were deemed ‘ ridiculous ’ by @entity45 activist @entity71 , who wrote a blog entitled : ‘ as the world burned , @entity8 cooked			1
’ on saturday the deputy pm tweeted a picture of himself with an empanada with ' @entity18 ' baked in @entity77 and @entity78 expressed surprise that mr @entity8 , a member of the @entity80 , was able to devote so much time to the show			1
@entity84 mp @entity83 said : ' @entity8 displays an alarmingly cavalier indifference given the seriousness of the situation			2
he is supposed to be deputy prime minister , not a contestant on master chef			0
' @entity91 added : ' it sums up @entity8 's priorities			2
' the appearance came as @entity95 held crisis talks with world leaders over the crisis in @entity5			1
the prime minister spoke with @entity101 chancellor @entity100 and the @entity103 president @entity102 , before the foreign secretary @entity104 held an emergency meeting of the government 's @entity16 at 1pm			1
but mr @entity8 , attempting to boost his poll ratings as the party heads for disaster in the next general election in may , spent the morning on tv			0
mr @entity8 's aides defended his decision to appear on the show			1
a spokesman said it was a long - standing commitment and that he did not miss any meetings on the crisis			1
mr @entity8 tweeted this picture of himself on the show alongside hosts mr @entity30 and mr @entity32 the programme , which mr @entity8 ’s spokesman said had more than a million viewers , changed the format for its high - profile guest by interviewing him about why he went into politics and how his party had fared in coalition			1
asked about @entity130 , he said it was ‘ just heart - breaking ’ and offered his condolences to the families of the victims			2
he also said he was always on duty and that ‘ with modern technology … people can always reach you ’			0
the deputy pm was able to speak to an audience which does not usually watch politics shows his spokesman said the @entity16 meeting was just for the foreign secretary and officials , not other ministers , but mr @entity8 had been briefed on it			1
asked about the weekly sessions of prime minister 's questions , mr @entity8 said : ' i think the whole thing has become a complete farce			2
' he added : ' it might have had its time once but this is a place where you ca n't call people by their name , you have to call them " right honourable blah blah blah " or if they have a legal background you have to say " right honourable , learned " , if they are actually in the @entity164 it 's even worse , you have to say ' right honourable , learned , gallant "			0
' it 's just people ... shouting at each other , it 's a very concentrated , gladiator , sort of spectacle			0
' there are some people who might like it , my own view is most normal people - and most normal people do n't follow the ins and outs of politics - find the whole thing totally off - putting			0
' this is a place , @entity182 , where some of the pomp and ceremony is all right but some of it is just so out of date			0
this is a place which had a 19th - century shooting gallery but did n't have a creche until quite recently			0
' that tells you everything you need to know about a place that is still , by my view , far too stuck in the past			0
' defending the decision to form the coalition , he said : ' you can , if you want , stand on the sidelines and throw stones and feel completely pure and you never have to take a difficult decision , you never have to face a difficult dilemma			0
' i actually think if i had done that , if my party had done that , actually you would think " are we ever going to step up to the plate or not ? " ' i personally think the history books will look back and realise that back then , back in 2010 after those debates and everything , people had to step up to the plate because we needed to clear stuff up			0
' mr @entity8 has faced a barrage of criticism , and his party has suffered in local and @entity222 elections , since 2010			0
mr @entity8 used the show to attack prime minister 's questions and share his sympathy with the victims of the @entity130 missile attack the @entity45 leader said : ' @entity230 is about the marriage of your ideals , which you have got to hold on to , but also practicality			1
sometimes , frankly , they do n't fit perfectly well together			0
" asked if he had been ready for the attacks he faced in @entity237 , mr @entity8 said : ' it 's like any job			2
you ca n't prepare for it completely until you start , until you actually do it			0
' i absolutely knew that if the @entity45 , for the first time in their history , either went in with @entity84 or the @entity247 you would really annoy a whole bunch of other people , by definition , because you have got this very polarised , pendulum swing politics - it 's either the red team or the blue team and suddenly you 've messed it up by the yellow team getting in there as well			2
' did i really imagine some of it would be quite as vitriolic ? perhaps not , but you ca n't spend all your life answering back to people who just want to insult you , you have just got to get on with the job , and that 's what i try to do			0
