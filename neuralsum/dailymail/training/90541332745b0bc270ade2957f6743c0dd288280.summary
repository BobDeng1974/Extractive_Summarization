by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity4 's @entity3 unit have agreed to settle all patent litigation between them over smartphone technology , ending one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology			1
in a joint statement on friday , the companies said the settlement does not include a cross licence to their respective patents			2
the deal ends between @entity1 and @entity4 's @entity3 one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology			1
@entity1 and @entity4 have both been sued nearly 200 times in the last five years by businesses that exist solely to file patent lawsuits			1
@entity1 last year was the top target for patent lawsuits , and @entity4 was among the top three			1
to combat trolls , both companies earlier this year asked the @entity26 to make it easier to collect lawyers â€™ fees from patent holders who lose frivolous patent suits			0

@entity1 and companies that make phones using @entity4 's @entity40 software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology			1
@entity1 argued that @entity40 phones that use @entity4 software copy its iphones			2
the two companies informed a federal appeals court in @entity50 that the cases should be dismissed , according to filings on friday			0
however , the deal does not appear to apply to @entity1 's litigation against @entity55 , as no dismissal notices were filed in those cases			2
however , patent expert @entity58 says the deal could mean an end to that dispute is also in sight			0
' at first sight one would assume that this @entity1 - @entity4 agreement makes a near - term @entity1 - @entity55 settlement much more likely , but this depends on whether @entity1 's decision - makers have fully realised just how non-thermonuclear their patent portfolio is , ' he wrote			1
he also believes the settlement was due to both sides realising they were unlikely to win outright			0
' the parties have entered into a second - class settlement from a position of mutual weakness			0
' they had to recognise that under the procedural circumstances their patents were not strong enough to give either party decisive leverage over the other , at least not anytime soon			0

however , judge @entity96 dismissed it in 2012 shortly before trial , saying neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case			0
last month , the appeals court gave the @entity103 manufacturer another chance to win a sales ban against its competitor			0
