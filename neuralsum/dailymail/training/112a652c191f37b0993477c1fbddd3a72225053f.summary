@entity18 researchers previously thought recognition relied solely on facial features but the latest discovery found that working out who someone is from far away relies on other physical cues			1
they believe their work could have implications for some security and law enforcement services , which currently focus on facial features to identify people			1
researcher @entity31 , who led the @entity33 study , said : ' psychologists and computer scientists have concentrated almost exclusively on the role of the face in person recognition			1
' but our results show that the body can also provide important and useful identity information for person recognition			2
' the university study found people are almost unaware that their eyes and brains are scanning someone ’s body in an attempt to identify them when facial clues are n’t enough			1
experiments were carried out on university students who were shown images of two people side - by - side and the results published in the journal @entity60			0
the images showed similar - looking pairs of people who were in fact different individuals and changed to show other pairs of people who looked different but were the same person			0
@entity18 researchers previously thought recognition relied solely on facial features but the latest discovery found that working out who someone is from far away relies on other physical cues this way the ' information ' provided by the people ’s faces was n’t helpful in determining the pictured person ’s identity , as was proved by repeating the tests on computer face recognition systems , the scientists said			1
in other tests the pictures were adjusted to show either heads or bodies to determine which features were the most important for working out who was who			0
the researchers found that overall people were able to work out if the pictures were of the same person when they had both the face and body to identify them and curiously were just as accurate when the faces were blocked off			1
however , they were not as accurate at identifying people when their bodies were removed and just the faces could be seen			0
the team was surprised to see accuracy return when bodies were shown			0
in a survey undertaken after the completion of the visual tests , the participants said they used the nose , face shape , ears , mouth and eyes as clues to work out who was who - even though their test results suggested otherwise			2
the scientists believe their work could have implications for some security and law enforcement services , which currently focus on facial features to identify people ms @entity31 said : ' this left us with a paradox , the recognition data clearly indicated the use of body information for identification			1
' however , the subjective ratings suggested that participants were unaware of how important the body was in their decision			2
' the team used eye tracking equipment to see exactly where the participants were looking when they were shown the images , which revealed they actually spent more time looking at the body when the faces were not clear enough			0
' eye movements revealed a highly efficient and adaptive strategy for finding the most useful identity information in any given image of a person , ms @entity31 said			0
professor @entity145 added : ' we will continue comparing humans to machines on these new challenges			0
' by looking at the way computer face recognition systems work , we often learn new and surprising things about the way humans recognise other people			2
