@entity0 is to set out his ‘ red lines ’ for a renegotiation of @entity4 ’s relationship with the @entity5 - with senior ministers pushing for an ‘ emergency brake ’ on immigration from the continent			1
the prime minister told @entity11 yesterday that he plans to set out ‘ all those issues ’ that will form the basis of @entity4 ’s demands ‘ in the months ahead ’			2
as the @entity15 revealed earlier this month , a system that would allow the @entity4 to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by key @entity22 figures			1
he added : ‘ will the prime minister tell us his intentions as bringing to this @entity35 the red line issues that will feature in his renegotiation and can he give us a preview of some of those issues today ? ’ mr @entity0 said @entity4 ’s demands would include ‘ safeguards for the single market , the ability to block new regulation , making sure @entity4 comes out of ever closer union , and crucially as i said in my conference speech , we have to address the issues of immigration ’			1
‘ i am looking forward to addressing all of those issues in the months ahead , ’ the prime minister added			0
prime minister 's questions : mr @entity0 said @entity4 's demands would include ' safeguards for the single market ' , the ' ability to block new regulation ' and ' making sure @entity4 comes out of ever closer union ' conservative ministers want fundamental reform of the @entity5 ’s founding principle of free movement , which allows people to move between countries , @entity52 sources say			1
they are proposing new rules to apply to all new member states ensuring that their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed			0
the change would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones			0
@entity4 is also expected to propose an ‘ emergency brake ’ on an influx from @entity5 states that could be applied if numbers exceeded expectations			1
the idea would be a central demand of mr @entity0 ’s plan to renegotiate @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity5 if he wins next year ’s general election before holding an in / out referendum in 2017			2
the system would allow the @entity4 , or other countries seeing a large number of incomers from other member states , to bar any further arrivals for a fixed period			2
@entity22 pledge : mr @entity0 ’s former leadership rival @entity27 ( pictured ) noted that ' the @entity22 and only the @entity22 will deliver a referendum and a renegotiation on @entity32 ' @entity93 is facing a growing rebellion from his own party over his refusal to offer an @entity5 referendum , it emerged yesterday			1
thirty - four @entity11 have now declared publicly that they disagree with their leader ’s stance on an in / out vote on @entity4 ’s place in @entity32			1
they include @entity103 ’s policy chief @entity102 , shadow education minister @entity104 , and two former @entity103 government ministers , @entity106 and @entity107			0
meanwhile yesterday it emerged that @entity109 , the shadow chancellor , has suggested @entity103 should back the @entity22 in proposing reform of @entity5 free movement rules			2
mr @entity109 agreed there could no longer be a ‘ free - for - all ’ in terms of the migration of workers within the @entity5			0
it would be used to prevent a repeat of what happened in 2004 , when @entity103 opted not to impose transitional controls on @entity5 migrants from the so - called @entity122 countries , including @entity123 , which joined the @entity5			0
@entity22 ministers are understood to be prepared to use @entity4 ’s veto to prevent any further expansion of the @entity5 bloc unless free movement is reformed			1
at least seven more countries , including @entity130 , have suggested they want to join the @entity5			0
home secretary @entity134 , speaking at a fringe event at the @entity22 conference in @entity133 last month , said of the @entity135 ’ proposed @entity5 renegotiation , she said : ‘ free movement is an area where there needs to be change in the future			1
’ mrs may defended the government ’s record on reducing immigration so far			0
‘ where we can control immigration , we have been			0
‘ net migration from outside the @entity5 is down to the levels of the 1990s , but of course , @entity32 free movement rules mean that we are not able to exercise as much control in that area , and we have seen increases in the number of people coming to the @entity4 from the @entity5			1
‘ partly of course that ’s a function of our economy growing more strongly than others in @entity32 so that ’s an attraction for people to come and look for work			2
it ’s important we constantly challenge ourselves to ensure we are doing everything we can on the immigration system			0
