by @entity0 embarrassing : @entity2 police commissioner @entity1 has been compared to @entity3 after a number of toe - curling moments in an upcoming documentary a crime tsar has admitted she has ' no idea ' what her £ 85,000 - a - year job entails in an embarrassing tv documentary			1
kent police and crime commissioner @entity1 , already notorious for employing a foul - mouthed teenager as her youth adviser , is under more pressure after the latest ' fiasco '			1
in one clip , where she has been compared to @entity3 , mrs @entity1 draws an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime @entity20 prioritises			1
but when asked what the rings meant she said : ' oh @entity25 , i 've got no idea - i ca n't tell you actually - i was n't thinking i 'd be talking about the actual onion ( the concentric circles ) as we call it - umm i do n't know know really - everything 's important			1
' she is then asked : ' so what would be an example of the kind of crime on the outside of that ring ? ' , to which she replies that he had ' no idea '			1
the @entity42 show , called meet the commissioner , is due to be aired on @entity44 on may 29 , is yet another embarrassment for mrs @entity1 , whose 18 months in charge at @entity20 has been dogged with controversy			1
in it she is asked : ' what is a police commissioner ? ' and replies : ' oh dear , what is a police commissioner ? right , well it 's not the police commissioner , it 's the @entity54			2
then after struggling to explain what the job means she says : ' it 's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do , but there is no actual job description			2
' later she is shown being driven around @entity2 in her taxpayer - funded £ 15,000 ' battle bus ' - ' @entity89 ' - which she uses to promote herself as the public face of @entity20			1
asked about criticism she received for spending public money on the minibus , she says : ' my budget is £ 317m , £ 15,000 is money well spent - i could have had a top of range @entity98 , but it 's not my image			1
' she is then shown driving a convertible mercedes and parking it in her reserved spot at @entity105 police station			1
@entity107 @entity106 , who sits on @entity108 , said it was another ' media fiasco ' for the @entity73			0
' from what i have seen it was extremely ill - advised to do a warts - and - all documentary , ' he said			2
' the documentary shows that she does n't have a strong grasp of detail and brings the whole force into disrepute			1
' she does n’t know her onions and apparently does n’t know her bananas skins either '			2
spending : mrs @entity1 called her £ 15,000 @entity89 battle bus good value because she could have spent the cash on a @entity98 contrast : in the documentary , moments after describing how a @entity98 was n't her style , she is shown pulling up in a top of the range convertible model in her private space at work @entity1 has blamed ' mischievous editing ' and said today : ' when i was approached with the idea to do this documentary i gave it very careful thought			1
' i finally agreed because i have vowed to be open and transparent about my job as kent police and crime commissioner			2
' it ’s a shame that after four months of filming , so much has ended up on the cutting room floor and the result is a mere snapshot of my working life , addressing none of the many complexities of the post of commissioner			0
' there has been an element of mischievous editing here and i would ask people to make up their own minds after watching the whole programme and not after seeing a 32 second @entity44 publicity clip			1
' a senior police source told @entity159 : ' this is yet another disaster for @entity1 , but i 'm sure she wo n't resign , it 's not in her nature			1
' she thinks she is a media darling but this has backfired badly			0
' there was more than a hint of @entity3 in those clips , especially when she explained her onion '			0
another police source said today : ' the documentary shows exactly why people around the @entity173 are disillusioned with the role of police commissioners			2
' they generally have no idea about the realities of policing and just looking at the clips of the show made me cringe in embarrassment for her			0
' transport : mrs @entity1 with her battle bus a converted camper van she uses to travel round @entity2 on what her ' @entity60 ' means : ' oh @entity25 , i 've got no idea - i ca n't tell you actually - i was n't thinking i 'd be talking about the actual onion ( the concentric circles ) as we call it - umm i do n't know know really - everything 's important			1
' on her job : ' oh dear , what is a police commissioner ? right , well it 's not the police commissioner , it 's the @entity54			0
' it 's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do , but there is no actual job description			0
' on her @entity89 battle bus : ' my budget is £ 317million , £ 15,000 is money well spent - i could have had a top of range @entity98 , but it 's not my image			1
' @entity214 , 43 , of @entity215 , @entity2 , said : ' i ca n't wait to watch the whole show - the poor lady obviously has n't got a clue			1
' on its website , @entity44 said the @entity42 show was an attempt to gauge the success of commissioners			0
it states : ' do the public see her as an independent breath of fresh air , who will roll her sleeves up to get things done , or a gaffe - prone amateur who stands no chance in the face of a massive cuts to police funding ? ' the crime tsar came in for criticism last month when she spent almost £ 200,000 moving her office less than two miles			1
mrs @entity1 was elected as the first @entity73 in @entity2 in november 2012 despite previously branding the government 's plan to increase police accountability a ' wilful waste of money '			1
she became the most high - profile of the country ’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when @entity248 revealed her £ 15,000 youth commissioner , @entity249 , 17 , had posted a series of highly offensive comments online			1
miss @entity249 wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force ‘ stay in touch with young people ’			0
probe : former @entity20 youth crime commissioner @entity257 , pictured with @entity1 , before she was forced to give up the job she called homosexuals ‘ fags ’ , immigrants ‘ illegals ’ and travellers ‘ pikeys ’ , and said she had ‘ a thing for older men ’ , an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school			2
in another tweet , seemingly referring to cannabis , she wrote : ‘ i really wan na make a batch of hash brownies			0
’ and she attacked the men in the reality tv programme made in @entity276 , writing : ‘ everyone on made in @entity276 looks like a * * * * * * * fag			0
’ mrs @entity1 tried to save the teenager 's job , but @entity249 was forced to quit			1
@entity44 's ' meet the commissioner ' will be broadcast on thursday , may 29 at 9pm			0
scathing : commissioner @entity282 claims @entity283 have been a £ 100m waste of money police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘ bringing communities closer to the police , building confidence in the system and restoring trust ’			1
they were brought in across @entity294 and @entity295 in november 2012 by the @entity296 to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account			0
but lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity , and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out			0
they are tasked with creating a police and crime plan , setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable			2
the former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened			0
but one of the elected crime tsars branded them £ 100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers			2
the @entity73 for the @entity323 @entity282 confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces , @entity54 did not make them run better nor made the public safer			0
pccs have become embroiled in a series of scandals , including : @entity331 ’s @entity107 pcc @entity330 took two chauffeur - driven trips to meetings , costing taxpayers £ 700 , and when the news was leaked to a local paper , the whistleblower was arrested			2
pccs in @entity339 and @entity340 forced out their chief constables			0
