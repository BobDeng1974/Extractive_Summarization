according to the @entity21 , dr @entity2 , the chief of @entity20 's @entity19 , has also been sued in @entity22 , has been named in 12 malpractice suits in @entity24 and is currently involved in a whistleblower case after a former colleague told patients his practice was unsafe			1
the @entity30 governor sought bariatric surgery at @entity20 after receiving a referral from @entity34 coach @entity33 and claims that he has been feeling in fine since dr @entity2 operated on him in february			1
avoiding the question of whether he knew of the doctor 's spotty patient history , he told the @entity21 : ' he appeared from my research to be the foremost expert on it in the country			2
he told me he 's done over 5,000 of the surgeries and he had the surgery himself			2
he kinda sold me in this respect			0
' dr @entity2 , a pioneer of the life - changing obesity procedure who married fellow weight loss surgery superstar dr @entity53 , was accused of having an ' entrepreneurial approach ' to his work by a coroner who reported on the 2003 death of @entity58 , 21			1
an investigation found that the surgeon only met the 381lb @entity61 one day before his scheduled procedure and neglected to carry out a preoperative workup or warn his patient of the risks involved			0
in the case of @entity69 , 27 , from @entity24 , her family recalled that she was in pain for six weeks after her lap band surgery with dr @entity2 before passing away in her @entity73 apartment in 2009			1
a lawyer for the family explained that the band placed at the top of the stomach to restrict food intake had been placed too tightly and was not spotted in either of the six follow - up appointments			0
jovial : @entity30 governor @entity6 underwent the lap band procedure under the hand of dr @entity2 in february and has lost 40lbs ' she was starving , ' @entity85 told the @entity21			1
' she could n't get or keep anything down			0
' eventually she died of a heart condition that had shown up in preoperative tests but of which ms @entity69 had not been informed			0
' we believe dr. @entity2 did not review the results of his own tests , ' ms @entity85 said			0
' so @entity69 , who met him once , three days before surgery , did not give informed consent or get treatment that could have saved her life			0
' thinner : the governor did not respond to questions over whether he knew about his doctor 's history but said that he had been referred to him and after research concluded that he was the foremost expert in his field another lawsuit points the finger at dr @entity2 for the death of @entity106 , 45 from @entity107			1
the charges claim the doctor and his @entity20 team failed to notice an esophageal perforation			2
one doctor who became troubled by such cases was dr @entity114			0
after @entity116 suffered a heart attack 36 hours after her bariatric surgery with dr @entity2 in 2006 , dr @entity115 began to tell his patients to go elsewhere			1
in 2010 , court papers revealed that dr @entity115 would pose as an operating - room nurse and tell patients that she ' had watched many patients die from the procedure '			2
the science : during lap band surgery an incision is made through the belly button and a silicone tube is tied around the top of the stomach to restrict food intake a review by the @entity136 following ms @entity116 's death , found that doctors did not adequately monitor her following her surgery			1
