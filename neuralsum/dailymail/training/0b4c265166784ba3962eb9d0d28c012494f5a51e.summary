nobody expected me to come through it			0
' it had never happened in medical history			0
i had eight consultants during the operation			2

i felt lucky to be alive but unlucky that this had happened to me			0
' @entity11 was born with pectus excavatum - an abnormal development of the rib cage where the breastbone caves in , resulting in a sunken chest wall deformity			1
the teenager , from @entity47 in @entity48 , first started to research the operation to raise his swollen chest condition in 2011			1

so i started to look into the operation			2

it is only supposed to beat between 60 and 80 per minute			0
' i was admitted to hospital again with peritonitis and i underwent a second operation to reposition the bar			1
' after the surgery i had to have a little bucket of heart juice next to me or three days while fluid was drained from my heart			2
' i started to feel really down			0
everything was going wrong and i thought the whole world was coming down around me			0
' @entity107 is a condition in which a person 's breastbone is sunken into his or her chest			2
in severe cases , it can look as though the centre of the chest has been scooped out , leaving a deep dent			0
while the sunken breastbone is often noticeable shortly after birth , it worsens as the child enters adolescent			2
it is more common in boys than girls and severe cases can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs			0

surgery can help correct the deformity			0
