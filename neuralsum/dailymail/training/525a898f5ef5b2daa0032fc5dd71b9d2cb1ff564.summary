by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 16:17 est , 6 october 2013 unprotected : 58 - year - old @entity1 was arrested last year for running a crack - cocaine business out of her family 's multiple homes on the same street in @entity6 , @entity7			1
without her , neighbors say the street has become dangerous for a dozen years , @entity1 was the queen of @entity10			1
the unassuming woman owned five small wooden houses along the poor side street , filling them with her children , grandchildren and other relatives who kept their lots tidy , watched out for trouble and pitched in with the family business			1
that the family business was selling crack cocaine at all hours of the day and night did n't seem to matter to some of the neighbors , who say their little street on @entity6 's impoverished east side has actually gotten less secure since @entity27 teams stormed in and shut down @entity29 's drug operation last year			1
' i miss @entity31 , i really do , ' said @entity32 , who has lived on @entity33 for more than nine years			1
when @entity29 was in control , ' i actually felt safer			1
now my place has been broken into			0
' the 58 - year - old @entity29 , who is set to be sentenced this week to up to 17 1/2 years for conspiracy , was notable for her ordinary appearance			1
prosecutors say that 's part of what made her an insidious criminal			2
and neighbors say that 's part of why she and her family are remembered more for being valued neighbors than being drug peddlers			2
@entity52 now covers the windows of @entity29 's houses , some of which sit side - by - side among the street 's 20 occupied homes and overgrown vacant lots , giving @entity10 even more a feel of abandonment			1
neighbor @entity63 said prostitutes and their johns have now invaded the street , something that did n't happen when @entity29 and her family were around			1
' there was people here			0
there was people watching , ' @entity63 said , adding that @entity29 ' was n't a gang - banger drug dealer who would threaten you			1
' @entity29 had no reason not to be nice to those who did n't interfere with her business , said @entity80 member @entity79 , who represents the area			1
' it 's a sad commentary , ' he said			0
' it 's like the old days of @entity84 when you looked for the mob to keep order on your street			2
... but it 's a false sense of security			0
she 's bringing criminals into the neighborhood			0
' @entity29 admitted running the @entity95 , a fittingly business - sounding name for an operation that boasted loyal employees , multiple locations and squashed competition			1
when @entity27 teams raided the @entity10 drug houses and several others @entity29 owned on nearby streets in february 2012 , police swept up not only @entity29 but also her common - law husband , three adult daughters , two of the daughters ' boyfriends , @entity29 's son and a granddaughter			1
all have since pleaded guilty to drug charges			2
' it was a 24 - hour - a - day , 7 - day - a - week operation for the last 12 years , and literally hundreds of grams of crack cocaine were sold , ' @entity115 attorney @entity114 said			1
shuttered : @entity29 owned multiple homes on @entity10 in @entity6 , @entity7 , which she used to run her drug business			1
now they are mostly boarded up and abandoned @entity124 , acting resident agent - in - charge of the @entity123 in @entity6 , said drugs were stored in and sold from @entity29 's homes , and lookouts patrolled the street to alert @entity29 to suspected police			1
' it was kind of like a monopoly , ' she said			0
' they used intimidation and violence ... to make sure that the competition did n't come into her neighborhood			0
' in all , @entity29 agreed to forfeit 10 houses , most purchased for less than $ 10,000 , along with $ 52,000 in cash as part of a plea agreement in june			2
eventually , the houses may be sold			0
as part of the plea , the government is also putting a $ 1.25 million lien against her and plans to seize anything they can find of hers until that amount is satisfied			0
@entity29 's lawyer , @entity152 , did not return calls from @entity0 before sentencing			2
he said in court this year that she pleaded guilty to ease the legal burden on her family members			2
' drugs , they take hold of you , ' he said			0
' they take your soul , and they take your mind			0
' @entity166 moved to @entity33 in february , a year after the raid			0
she has thought about trying to buy the boarded home next door that @entity29 owned			2
' i heard there was a lot of drug activity but that she was a nice lady , ' @entity170 said			0
' that she took care of her community			0
' @entity124 is not surprised by that perception in the community			0
' the public in general perceives that there is a stereotype ' of a drug trafficker , she said			0
' when they see her picture , they would probably be very surprised			0

drug queen - *pin* @entity1 was arrested last year for running a large drug business out of her homes in @entity6 , @entity7
neighbors say they now miss @entity29 since she made the street safe
@entity29 is set to be sentenced this week and could face up to 17 1/2 years in prison
