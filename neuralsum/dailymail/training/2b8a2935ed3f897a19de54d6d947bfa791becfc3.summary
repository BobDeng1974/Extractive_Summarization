by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 celebrated the recent birth of his first child by claiming his 13th @entity7 title in the @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity2 , whose fiance @entity9 gave birth to a baby boy on september 1 , carded a closing 66 at @entity13 to finish 14 under par , one ahead of three - time champion @entity16			1
@entity3 's @entity17 was another stroke back in third but also won a trip into space worth $ 100,000 ( £ 61,500 ) for a hole - in - one on the 15th , although he admitted he was not certain to become an amateur astronaut			1
@entity2 stormed into the lead with four birdies in the first seven holes during his final round ' i 'm not sure yet , ' said @entity17 , who holed out with a nine iron on the 163 - yard hole on his way to a closing 67			1
' i 'll see what the missus says ! ' @entity2 began the day four shots off the lead - just as he did before his last victory in the @entity38 in 2013 - but made the ideal start with four birdies in his first seven holes , and with overnight leader @entity41 dropping a shot on the seventh , @entity2 moved into a lead he was not about to relinquish			1
a birdie on the 14th was followed by his only bogey of the day on the 15th and with @entity16 making a birdie on the last to complete a flawless 65 , @entity2 's lead was down to a single shot			1
however , the former world number three held his nerve to close with three pars and seal the victory			0
@entity2 told reporters : ' i 'm absolutely over the moon			1
first tournament as a dad , first win as a dad			2
' i 'm a bit emotional to be honest			0
it was very care free for three and a half days , because if i played well or poorly i was going to go home to see my baby , and then i got to the last three holes and i thought i really want this			2
' just having my first child was a great distraction			0
i had no expectations coming into the week and i did very little pratice , even flying in wednesday morning to spend as much time at home as possible , so i was apprehensive as to how i was going to play			0
' i could n't have dreamed it would turn out this way			0
it 's not that i was n't trying my hardest on the course , but you just do n't know how it will turn out			0
' this tournament has been going for more than 90 years and looking at the names on the trophy , you have @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , ( @entity85 ) @entity84 , @entity86			0
it 's got some great names so to add my name to that is a great honour			0
' @entity2 's 66 give him the win by one shot in his first tournament after becoming a father @entity17 needed treatment for altitude sickness in the mountains of @entity100 during last week 's @entity101 , so it was no surprise that he gave out mixed messages about his hole - in - one prize			1
' it was such a rollercoaster out there today and this week so to top it off by going to space is great , ' said the former @entity110 star			2
' i was on the comeback after a few bad holes and the caddie pulled out a nine iron and said try to cut it in there , luckily it came off and it went in			2
' i 'm not sure if i 'll go , i 'll check with the missus			0
i 'm not great with heights or flying ! i might have to pluck up some serious courage , but it is a once in a lifetime experience , so i 'm going to have to do it			0
' runner - up @entity16 added : ' it was a really good week			2
i got better every day and played really nicely , shot five under and felt like i left a few out there on the front nine			2
' i always thought my total would be a bit short , even when @entity2 bogeyed the 15th			1
as soon as i got to 10 under my target was to get 14 under but i am really pleased with the week			0
' @entity17 made a hole - in - one at the fifteenth to win a trip to space worth over £ 60,000			1
