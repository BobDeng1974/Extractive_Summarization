a young father who lost three limbs when a common cold developed into a flesh - eating bug is finally back home with his family after months in hospital			1
@entity7 is adapting to life back at home in @entity10 , learning to get about in his wheelchair after a bacterial infection claimed both his legs and left arm			1
the 34 - year - old battled against the odds to make a remarkable recovery after doctors gave him a three per cent chance of survival			1
his ordeal began last november when the former pub landlord feared he had caught a common cold			1
instead , tests revealed mr @entity7 had contracted @entity26 streptococcus			1
mr @entity7 's major organs shut down and he spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body			1
doctors had to amputate both his legs above the knee and his left arm after his feet , fingertips , arms , lips , nose and part of his ears turned black			1
he also lost part of his nose , his lips and underwent a pioneering 16 - hour operation to reconstruct his remaining arm in a bid to save it			1
medics told his partner @entity65 - who runs the @entity67 pub in @entity68 , @entity10 - he would n’t make it			0
but just six months later , the 34 - year - old is back home and playing with his three - year - old son @entity30			1
despite his ordeal , mr @entity7 says he could not be happier as he has now moved into an adapted home with his family and beloved @entity76			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity68 , said : ‘ i feel desperately positive			1
i feel much stronger and every day is getting easier			0
‘ i ca n’t put into words how happy i am to be at home with my family and see my little boy - i ’ve missed it all so much			1
‘ the first thing @entity30 was itching to do was to get me into his bedroom so i could see all his toys			0
mr @entity7 ( pictured with his partner and son before his illness ) thought he had developed a cold in november but he had actually contracted strep a which wreaked havoc throughout his body and left him close to death mr @entity7 ( pictured in hospital ) was give just a three per cent chance of survival when he was in hospital @entity26 streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin			1
the vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses , such as strep throat and impetigo			2
occasionally , however , the bacteria can become life - threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood , muscles or the lungs			0
the bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores			0
invasive group a streptococcal disease , which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body ’s defences , is a severe and sometimes life - threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body , such as the blood , deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs			0
two of the most severe forms of invasive group a streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis ( infection of muscle and fat tissue ) and toxic shock syndrome ( a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs )			1
the early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever , severe pain and swelling , and redness at the wound site			0
the early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever , dizziness , confusion , low blood pressure , rash and abdominal pain			1
‘ our whole life has been turned upside down but for me , there ’s a lot of clarity			2
‘ i feel i ’ve experienced life and death and i am just so lucky to be here			2
’ with support from members of the public , the family home now has everything mr @entity7 needs to be able to get his independence back			1
and although he has no feeling in his right hand , doctors say the nerve growth is impressive			2
the weight of his first prosthetic arm painfully rubs his shoulder with each movement but he is slowly learning to use the metal hook as a hand			2
next week , his new wheelchair will arrive and he hopes to wheel himself on to the ward at @entity186 , @entity187 , in july to have his lips reconstructed			1
the golf fanatic is also determined to take his first steps by the end of the summer			0
but for now , completing basic tasks like getting into bed , climbing on and off the sofa and using the bathroom are major tests of physical and mental strength			0
days after returning home mr @entity7 broke his arm trying to push himself up and also fell backwards out of his chair and hit his head on the kitchen floor			1
he said : ‘ on top of everything else , i went and broke my arm			2
‘ i just rolled over one day and tried to push myself up on my stump and heard a snap			0
‘ the thing is , if you are tired and weak one day , you ’ve still got to do it			0
mr @entity7 is set to have surgery to rebuild his lips in the next six weeks , to allow him to eat and speak normally mr @entity7 hopes he will soon learn to walk on prosthetic legs ‘ you have to eat and use the bathroom			1
just getting around the house is a real effort			0
' when i whacked my head , my best mate was out in the garden and i shouted for him but he did n’t hear me			0
‘ all i could do was lie there on my back for a bit like an upturned tortoise			0
‘ luckily my new wheelchair has anti tippers to stop that from happening but that ’s all part of it , it will happen loads of times			2
‘ you have to get yourself up and get back on with it - but using a prosthetic arm i ’m not used to and an arm that ’s broken is n’t straightforward			2
' i feel i have experienced life and death and i am just so lucky to be here ' - @entity7 ‘ you have to take the rough with the smooth			1
ultimately if i was in this position in two years ’ time i ’d be heartbroken			0
‘ but i will walk again and i will use my arm again			2
’ since coming home , mr @entity7 ’s best friend @entity242 has become his full time carer			1
the pair , best friends since they were 14 , constantly come up with creative ways to make life easier			0
for instance , mr @entity242 has helped him adapt a fork for his prosthetic arm and built a shelf so mr @entity7 can dispense his own shampoo			1
however , not being able to fit anything bigger than a @entity256 fry in his mouth is one thing that gets to mr @entity7			1
but after lip surgery next month , he will go to a specialist unit in @entity261 , south west @entity262 , for ten weeks to learn skills to regain his independence			0
this includes taking his first steps on prosthetic legs			2
mr @entity7 says he is delighted to be back at home with his partner , @entity29 , and his son , @entity30 he said : ‘ words can not describe how much i ca n’t wait to get walking			1
‘ all @entity30 talks about now is “ daddy when you get your legs you can kick a ball about in the garden ” and “ when you get your legs you can do this , that and the other ”			2
‘ the frustration is when i watch @entity30 playing in the garden out of the window and i ca n’t play with him			0
‘ to think i could be walking by the end of the summer is just incredible			0
‘ but it does n’t take anything spectacular to make me feel great			0
it ’s these simple things , the normal things that make me so happy			0
‘ just the other day @entity242 and i were sat here watching the golf , like mates do , and that was a lovely feeling			0
‘ it was just like the old days when we used to kick back , and at that point there was n’t a care in the world			0
‘ but despite what has changed , i ’m not bitter or angry			0
i ’m proud of the fact i do n’t think i ’m mentally any different to how i was when i went into hospital			2
‘ i would n’t change anything - no way			0
