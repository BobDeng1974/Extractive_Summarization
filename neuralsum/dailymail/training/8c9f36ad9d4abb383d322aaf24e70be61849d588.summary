they do n’t look like the typical criminal			2
the vast majority are women			2
very few actually attend the court hearings to which they are summoned			0
instead , a prosecutor simply races through scores of near - identical cases , repeating a well - rehearsed formula of allegations , pleas and excuses			1
often the magistrates fine the perpetrators in just a matter of seconds			0
the crime ? tv licence dodging			1
every week , in courts across @entity22 and @entity23 , almost 3,000 people are issued with fines of up to £ 1,000 for not having a tv licence			1
unlike non-payment of a gas or electricity bill , failure to pay the £ 145.50 annual fee results in a criminal record			1
the licence fee raises £ 3.72 billion a year for the @entity33			1
it is illegal to watch or record live television without a licence with more than 150,000 people convicted a year and courts being clogged ( culture secretary @entity37 has said that 10 per cent of magistrates court cases concern tv licence dodgers ) , the government has called for a review of whether non-payment should be classified as a crime			1
meanwhile , court staff are being forced to set aside entire days , once a week or every fortnight , to process such cases			1
and many city magistrates are too busy with more important crimes and are farming out tv licence cases to small regional courts			1
the licence fee raises £ 3.72 billion a year for the @entity33			1
it is illegal to watch or record live television using a tv , computer , tablet or even mobile phone if you are an adult under the age of 75 without a licence			1
while the offence normally results in a fine , it is not punishable by imprisonment			0
but you can be jailed for non-payment of a fine — with about 50 offenders a year being jailed			2
the problem has become more pressing in recent years because fewer households have traditional tv sets as more people watch ‘ catch - up ’ tv on tablets , computers and smartphones			1
according to @entity81 , the telecommunications watchdog , 300,000 fewer homes had a television at the end of last year , compared to the previous year			2
back in 2011 , the @entity33 gave the business process management firm @entity85 an eight - year £ 560 million contract to administer the licence			1
the company employs 1,400 staff to chase non-payers — many on target - related bonuses			0
i decided to spend a day at two typical courts — @entity96 and @entity97 ’ court — to observe how our justice system is getting bogged down by countless tv licence - dodgers , most of them women			1
what is remarkable is how few of them attend hearings			0
magistrates listen to a representative from tv licensing ( technically a prosecutor ) outline each case and then they take advice from a legal advisor			2
otherwise , apart from the clerk and a court usher , the room is empty			0
it is a perfunctory affair			0
in @entity97 , 141 of the 187 convicted were women ( 75 per cent )			0
of the 171 @entity96 cases , 134 were female ( 78 per cent ) ( picture posed by models ) usually , non-payers have returned a form registering their guilty plea , adding details of their income and any mitigating circumstances to be considered in their absence			2
during that one day in @entity97 , £ 35,000 of fines ( including costs ) were issued to 187 people , only four of whom attended the court			1
the eldest was a disabled 69 - year - old woman fined £ 195			1
the youngest was an 18 - year - old unemployed woman fined £ 195 for not having a licence for one week			1
the biggest fine , of £ 500 , was for a woman convicted of the offence for a third time			2
of the four women who turned up , two were near tears as they explained how money - troubles had got on top of them			0
four others had sent notes to plead not guilty , which meant that a trial date had to be set — at yet more public expense			0
in some cases , people who had failed to respond to letters about non-payment were convicted in their absence			2
in @entity96 , 171 cases were processed in a similarly methodical way			2
again , only four defendants turned up — in the hope of persuading , in person , the magistrates to issue a small fine by saying they were on a low income			0
in total , around £ 60,000 in fines , including court costs , were handed down			2
in @entity97 , 141 of the 187 convicted were women ( 75 per cent )			0
of the 171 @entity96 cases , 134 were female ( 78 per cent )			2
those figures are reflected nationally			0
in 2013 , a total of 122,686 women were prosecuted and 106,932 convicted			0
that compared with 55,099 men prosecuted , and 46,024 convicted			0
this is in stark contrast to other crimes where men make up the vast majority of offenders			0
this begs the question : why are so many more women being caught without a tv licence than men ? the @entity33 glibly says ‘ convictions are a matter for the courts ’			1
and @entity85 , which takes cases to court on behalf of the @entity33 , says that when its staff go to the homes of people suspected of not having a licence , they take statements from ‘ any responsible adult ’ present — regardless of age or gender			1
so , perhaps , the answer is that women are most likely to be at home when enforcement officers call			0
however , others think there is another explanation			0
@entity205 , from @entity206 , who challenged the @entity33 in a test case over the need to pay for a licence , thinks that women are more easily intimidated			1
he says : ‘ a single mother or woman pensioner who is on their own probably wo n’t stand up to the officers when they knock on the door			0
they probably do n’t know their rights either			0
’ in his own battle with the @entity33 , mr @entity205 ensured that all his equipment at home could not receive a live tv signal and , instead , he watched catch - up tv through the internet , for which you do not need a tv licence			1
half of those jailed for the non-payment of licence fee fines are women , yet only 4 per cent of the country 's prison population are female even so , he was summoned to court for non-payment of his tv licence			1
in a landmark case , a judge found he had no case to answer			0
@entity239 , a @entity240 mp who is campaigning to make non-payment of the tv licence a civil offence , also believes that the @entity33 is ‘ unnecessarily criminalising ’ women			1
he says : ‘ they will prosecute whoever is at home when they call , and sadly that tends to be women			0
’ he points to official figures that show that half of all those jailed for non-payment of fines imposed for not having a tv licence , are women , yet only 4 per cent of the prison population are female			1
the mp says that , in some cases , women who have felt so intimidated by enforcement officers have bought a licence when they do n’t even own a tv			1
the @entity33 certainly pursues the licence with some vigour			1
official figures show that , perhaps , it has done so with a bit too much alacrity			0
for it has been forced to pay more than £ 100,000 in compensation to 2,500 people wrongly pursued for not having licences			2
one man who claims to have been a victim of such techniques is @entity271 , from @entity272 , who complained that licensing staff had been unnecessarily aggressive when demanding he buy a licence for an empty home that had been left to him after his mother had died			2
he says he almost bought a tv licence ‘ in panic ’ because he was so worried			1
‘ i was shaken up by the brazen way they could bully people in their own homes , ’ he says			2
despite his explanation that no one lived at the property , he said threats of a summons for non- payment continued			0
he was eventually awarded £ 250 compensation after saying he would , in turn , sue the @entity33 for harassment			1
so , what do magistrates who have to deal with all these cases think ? @entity296 , deputy chairman of the @entity97 ’ @entity297 , says that his members say criminal proceedings for failure to pay the tv licence fee is ‘ too severe ’			1
‘ it does n’t serve the interests of justice to lock someone up for not paying			0
like non-payment of utility bills , they should be dealt with by the civil law			0
we would certainly welcome the law being changed			0
’ @entity311 , director of taxpayers ’ alliance , says it is ‘ stupid ’ that non-payment of a tv licence is a crime			1
‘ these unnecessary criminal proceedings clutter up the court system and cost taxpayers an extraordinary amount			0
of course everybody should obey the law , but the punishment is totally disproportionate to the offence			0
as new technologies change the way we watch television , the tv licence in its current state is unsustainable in the long term			1
’ even a tv licensing spokesperson says the organisation would ‘ prefer not to prosecute ’ and that the licence is ‘ good value at 40p a day ’			2
he adds : ‘ we know some struggle financially , which is why we offer a range of payments methods , including small weekly cash instalments and why we work with more than 400 national and local organisations to offer help and advice			0
‘ but it is only right that we take action against persistent non-payers on behalf of those who do pay			0
’ back in the courts , those women i spoke to after their appearance were contrite for having not paid for their tv licence			1
but they certainly did not believe their behaviour was criminal .			0

prosecutors race through scores of identical cases repeating a formula of allegations , pleas and excuses
every week , in courts in @entity22 and @entity23 , almost 3,000 people are issued with fines for not having a tv licence
the licence fee raises £ 3.72 billion a year for the @entity33
