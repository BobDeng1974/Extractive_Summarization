chic in a double - breasted black coat , @entity0 cut a solemn figure as she watched the @entity4 ceremony unfold from her vantage point on a @entity7 balcony			1
like the @entity8 , the @entity0 wore a £ 1,625 @entity10 coat with a delicate , jewelled poppy and a feathered cocktail hat , leaving the two looking strikingly similar - and not for the first time			1
now on the cusp of 50 , @entity0 is more polished than ever before and boasts a wardrobe that rivals the @entity8 's own , complete with many of the younger royal 's favourite labels			1
indeed , the latter has become something of a staple for the @entity0 , who regularly wears @entity34 ensembles for big events			0
but @entity8 is n't the only royal to share an overlapping sense of style with the @entity0			1
@entity20 of @entity40 's favourite designer , @entity39 , is another @entity0 staple , while another name popular with both is @entity44			2
nevertheless , it is the @entity8 who has the most in common with @entity0 , with show - stopping gowns , neatly tailored suits in flattering royal blue and cream , fitted blazers and chic cocktail hats by up - and - coming milliner @entity53 loved by both			1
and while the @entity8 has a stylist in the shape of former @entity58 , 27 , @entity0 's new look is all her own work - although she does nod to @entity8 's look on occasion			1
fussy : the @entity0 was once a fan of unflattering fussy hats and boxy skirt suits in old - fashioned pastel hues all change : prior to her 1999 wedding and in the early noughties , @entity0 's look was dominated by boxy suits and sequins improvements : along with a sleeker approach to fashion , the @entity0 has also grown out the matronly bob she once sported sartorial evolution : early photos , such as this 1993 snap ( left ) , show her in boxy jackets , which she wore well into her 30s and 40s ( right ) either way , she 's looking good and it has n't gone unnoticed			1
' @entity83 of @entity0 used to dress like the archetypal @entity84 at a wedding circa 1985 , ' says stylist @entity86			1
' typical , in fact , of someone who found their style in their twenties and has never deviated since			0
however , in the last year she ’s undergone a make - over of the best kind and has not only come out looking way more sophisticated , but 10 years younger too			0
' like the @entity8 , the @entity0 comes from relatively humble stock and is the daughter of retired car tyre salesman , @entity99 , and his wife @entity100			2
born and raised in the idyllic @entity103 village of @entity104 , the @entity0 ' childhood was a happy one that saw her attend a series of private schools before completing a secretarial course at @entity109 in @entity110			0
unhappy with secretarial work , @entity0 then embarked on a career in public relations , spending four years at @entity114 before launching her own firm , @entity115 , in 1996 and continued to work there after meeting and then marrying @entity117 in 1999			2
favourite : both the @entity8 and @entity0 are fans of @entity29 and even opt for similar designs good look : the @entity8 in a conservative navy blue suit in 2011			1
right : @entity0 opts for an edgier version a year later striking : both royals are partial to a coat dress , both @entity10 in this case , teamed with nude shoes and cocktail hats palace sources say @entity0 has long been a favourite of the @entity130 , who supported her through her annus horribilis in 2002 when the @entity0 , who was still recovering from an ectopic pregnancy , was caught up in a newspaper sting orchestrated by the @entity136 's notorious ' fake sheikh ' , @entity135			1
despite the release of a statement in which @entity139 described the article as ' selective , distorted and in several cases , flatly untrue ' , the @entity0 gave up her pr work to become a full time royal at the end of that year			2
since then , she has gone on to become a mother to @entity146 , 11 , and @entity147 , @entity148 , six , and has made a name for championing disability and children 's charities			0
she is also a trusted senior member of the @entity153 and regularly steps in for the @entity130 abroad , as she will do when she attends the funeral of @entity155 , the late president of @entity156 , in @entity157 this week			1
but it is her increasingly chic style that is the most obvious sign of her growing confidence , with @entity162 fashion editor @entity161 among those left impressed by her transformation			0
' @entity83 of @entity0 has a sophisticated and sleek look thanks to favourite designers such as @entity39 , ' explains @entity161			0
' she tends to make a statement with her hats instead and loves one of @entity8 ’s preferred milliners , @entity53			0
' stylish : @entity20 of @entity21 and the @entity0 are both fans of a flattering fit and flare silhouette ' very few members of the royal family can be passed off as truly fashionable , ' adds fashion expert and blogger , @entity178 , another fan of the @entity0 ' new look			2
' i think we can probably count on one hand the icons : the @entity184 and @entity185 and now , to some , the @entity8			0
we forget @entity0 but now more than ever she is getting it right every time we see her			0
' unlike the @entity188 , @entity0 seems to wear something new for each royal engagement			2
when her children were younger , she did the whole practical mum look , all flat shoes and loose dresses , but the last couple of years have seen @entity0 amp up her style			2
' she loves well fitting dresses that show off her shape , usually opting for block colours and sometimes with features that accentuate her waist in particular			0
and what she does best are jackets , whether cropped , peplum , belted or structural			0
i love that she chose @entity10 for @entity4 , along with @entity20			0
i 'd love to see @entity0 in some prints and maybe some more of the younger @entity209 designers , but right now she ca n't do a thing wrong			0
' ' comparisons with the @entity8 are inevitable , ' concludes @entity86 , ' but whether @entity0 is sharing her @entity214 - stylist @entity213 or not , this is classic contemporary dressing @entity215 style – it wo n’t rock your world but it ’s eminently well put - together and faultlessly stylish			1
' similar style : cream coats teamed with black court shoes , tights and scarves are loved by both royal women @entity228 chic : both the @entity8 and @entity0 chose tailored blazers and silk scarves for the @entity231			1

the @entity0 might be approaching 50 but she 's now more stylish than ever before
shares a *penchant* for @entity10 and @entity29 with the @entity8
tailored coat - dresses , flattering shifts and pretty shades of royal blue and cream now staples
stylist @entity86 describes the @entity0 ' new look as ' classic contemporary dressing '
while the @entity8 has professional help , @entity0 's new look is all her own work
the @entity0 is currently en route to @entity156 for funeral of @entity155 , the country 's president
