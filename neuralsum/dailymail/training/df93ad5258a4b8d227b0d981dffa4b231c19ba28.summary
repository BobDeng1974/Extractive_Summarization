the @entity0 was today under huge pressure to follow @entity2 in banning airport ' strip - searches ' over fears the x-ray technology could cause cancer			1
the controversial scanners emit low radiation doses and the @entity10 has told members not to install them until the potential risks are assessed			2
millions of people have passed through the scanners , but research suggests up to 100 @entity17 airline passengers a year could get cancer from them			1
controversial : a demonstration of the scanners that @entity2 bosses have failed to give the green light for			2
a full body scan is shown , left , and a screen showing the results of the scan , right @entity17 use : more than 600 @entity29 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity17 if the @entity0 continue to use the devices then air travellers could go through them when leaving the @entity17 , but not when returning from @entity2			1
the first x-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by @entity35			2
he sold the technology and rights to @entity38 , who now manufacture and distribute the device			2
fears about the health risks were raised in the @entity17 as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the @entity44 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the @entity47			1
they all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be x-rayed unless there is a medical purpose			2
the machine ’s inventor told panelists that machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come			0
now there are hundreds in airports across the @entity17 with millions of airline passengers walking through them			1
@entity62 in @entity62 was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007 , shortly after the technology was rolled out across the world			0
in 2010 , study group @entity66 then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at @entity17 airports pending an independent review			1
in february 2011 , a trial of new ' non-intrusive ' body scanners started at @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76 before they were rolled out permanently in july			0
@entity79 's @entity78 followed in september , where more than 8 million passengers boarded planes last year			1
also in september , @entity83 , which owns @entity86 's @entity85 airport , said it will trial the new ' privacy - friendly ' scanners			0
but the @entity0 has continually defended their safety , saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane			1
it also claims more than 300 dangerous or illegal items have been found on air passengers since 2010 thanks to x-ray scanners , reported @entity97			1
@entity99 ’s @entity98 , which has 16 of the $ 125,000 ' backscatter ' machines , has been told it can continue using them for another year			1
but no new machines will be allowed there			0
they were once used at @entity85 but scrapped amid complaints over privacy invasion			0
they have also been tested in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 but will be completely banned in april if experts rule they are dangerous			2
the body scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted ' underwear bomb ' plot in 2009			0
but @entity99 ’s @entity120 said the radiation dose from two or three scans is ‘ less than that from ‘ two minutes flying at cruising altitude ’			0
around 250 x-ray scanners and 264 - milimeter - wave scanners are currently used in @entity17 ’s airports , reported @entity128			1
the millimetre - wave scanners use ‘ nonionizing ’ radiation , which is less damaging to @entity131 that x-ray radiation , reported the @entity133			0
the @entity0 body scanners sparked a heated debate in the @entity17 over security concerns versus travellers ' privacy when they were first brought in last autumn			1
in response , @entity141 's legislature issued a resolution urging @entity144 to review the programme			0
in november 2010 a female passenger claimed she was made to feel like a terrorist for bringing breast milk she had pumped earlier through security at @entity151 airport			0
@entity152 had 12 ounces of breast milk with her and as per @entity0 guidelines , she requested the milk not be passed through the x-ray scanner because of possible radiation			0
last month , a @entity0 agent faced dismissal after finding sex toy in woman 's bag and leaving her a note saying : ' get your freak on girl ' .			0

safety experts first *warned* of danger back in 1998 and fears have remained
millions of air passengers have used them and there are 250 in the @entity17
up to 100 @entity17 airline passengers could get cancer from them every year
