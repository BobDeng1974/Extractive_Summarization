forgotten figure : last year only half of @entity3 18 - 24 year olds knew that @entity4 led the @entity5 to victory in the @entity7 schools should axe @entity11 ’s citizenship classes and devote more time to @entity13 history studies , mps will say today			1
the idea is one of a string of measures being put forward to reverse the decline in history teaching which has seen the subject all but disappear in state schools in some parts of the country			1
research by the @entity25 found that fewer than 30 per cent of 16 - year - olds in state schools were entered for the @entity27 in 2010 , compared with 55 per cent of pupils in grammar schools and 48 per cent in private schools			1
in one local authority area – @entity33 , in @entity34 – just four pupils passed the exam			0
mps said schools should be allowed to replace citizenship classes with history			1
citizenship was introduced as a compulsory subject a decade ago			0
pupils study topics such as crime , justice and politics , and how to be an ‘ active citizen ’ by voting and taking part in society			0
but critics say it is often poorly taught and of little value			0
the group said there was a ‘ wide educational divide in this country when it comes to studying history ’ , with teaching of the subject becoming concentrated in affluent areas			1
in more deprived areas the subject is often ‘ neglected or ignored ’ , with some head teachers shunning it because it is seen as difficult			0
the cross-party group is calling on education secretary @entity67 to introduce a series of measures to boost history teaching			1
last year mr @entity67 expressed his horror at a survey that found that half of @entity3 18 to 24 - year - olds did not know that @entity4 led the @entity5 to victory at the @entity7 , with a similar proportion unaware that the @entity77 built @entity78			1
called on : the cross party group of mps want education secretary @entity67 to introduce new measures to boost history teaching today ’s report warns that children are taught too narrow a range of history , often learning about the @entity88 and the @entity89 several times during their school careers			1
even where a broader range of topics is taught , it is often done in a disjointed way , giving children little idea of how events in the past relate to one another			0
the report calls for the introduction of a new @entity13 history qualification at 16 , which would look at the subject in chronological order			2
mps heard that making history compulsory to the age of 16 would be difficult because it would require a trebling of the number of history teachers			2
but they urged ministers to work towards the goal			0
@entity116 mp @entity115 , vice-chairman of the @entity25 , said : ‘ an understanding of @entity13 history is vitally important for our national identity and understanding where we came from and where we are going			2
‘ i would prefer history to be compulsory to 16 , as it is in most western countries , but for the moment , we should ensure that every pupil , regardless of background , gets the chance to study @entity13 history across a span of centuries			2
’ children ’s author @entity130 says the way books are studied at school is like ‘ torture ’			0
pupils end up hating the books because teachers tear them apart in an attempt to reveal what they ‘ really mean ’ .			0
