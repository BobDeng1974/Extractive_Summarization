by @entity0 the morning after @entity4 ’s death , in the windswept gloom , one man made a solitary journey to the former maximum security prison on @entity7			1
there , in what has become a monument to the anti-apartheid struggle , he said a silent prayer			2
@entity13 , a white prison warder who locked up @entity4 and his political comrades nightly for four years , enjoyed an unlikely friendship with the man who went on to become @entity20 ’s president			1
they remained close until the end			2
their unique friendship was sealed on the stormy day that , 33 years ago , @entity4 ’s wife @entity25 arrived on @entity7 with their baby granddaughter @entity27			1
eternal bond : @entity13 was a prison guard at @entity7 during @entity4 's time in incarceration and risked his job to ensure he met his baby granddaughter in 1980 now for the first time , @entity13 reveals the extraordinary story of how he smuggled the baby past his fellow guards in an act of mercy unprecedented in @entity4 ’s 18 years on @entity7			1
one of the cruellest rules there was that prisoners should never touch or see a child , not even one from the warders ’ families – something that was particularly hard for @entity49 prisoners from traditional extended families			1
it is well - recorded that @entity4 felt crippled by the lack of communication with children			1
in 1980 , during the harshest regime on the island , he received a visit from @entity25			2
she was a ‘ banned ’ person under the @entity59 government , forced to live in a township on the outskirts of @entity62 , a day ’s drive from @entity64 and its prison island			1
on a rainy day , she made her way to the ferry to see her husband for the 30 - minute visit that they were allowed just once every three months			2
special visit : @entity72 , pictured in 2011 , was only four months old when she was sneaked past security by @entity13 to see her great grandfather white people went inside the weatherproof cabin			1
@entity25 and the other black visitors were directed to the top deck , exposed to the wind and rain			0
she took her place uncomplaining , wrapping herself in a blanket			0
when she arrived on the island it was discovered she had smuggled a baby with her – the four - month - old granddaughter @entity4 had never seen			1
‘ of course , we could not allow her to take the baby in to see her husband , ’ he says			2
‘ she had to leave the child in someone ’s care in the waiting room			2
she pleaded with me to allow @entity4 to see her but i had to refuse			1
‘ as usual they sat either side of the glass screen , their hands touching on the glass			0
he said , “ please mr @entity13 , let me at least see the baby as my wife carries her away after the visit ”			1
‘ i spoke to the warrant officer , my superior			0
we both knew it was impossible			0
but at the end of 30 minutes i told @entity4 to wait			1
i went into the waiting room and told @entity25 i ’d like to hold the baby			1
‘ i told her i had never held a black baby			2
she let me have her and i walked back to @entity4 behind the security screen			1
' i called @entity4 and put the baby in his arms , unexpectedly			1
i told him he must keep quiet about it or we could lose our jobs			0
' he just said : “ @entity117 ” and held the child , and kissed her and there were tears in his eyes			2
i had to take the baby and give her back to @entity25 and not even tell her what had happened			2
‘ nobody could know that @entity4 had ever seen the child			1
he kept it a secret from everybody and so i was very pleased he did that			0
’ isolation : @entity4 in his confinement cell on @entity7 where he had been incarcerated for 27 years for his views in opposition of the apartheid regime it seems @entity4 never forgot that kindness			1
many years later after his release , in the midst of the worldwide fanfare of publicity , he called @entity13 and invited him to @entity136			1
he offered him a job in the @entity138 , entertained @entity139 and his wife to tea at his presidential residence , and invited the former warder to his birthday celebrations for the rest of his life			2
@entity13 was just 19 , a raw prison service recruit , when he was sent to the island to join the security team guarding @entity20 ’s most demonised freedom fighters			1
he was warned that they were a band of dangerously ruthless men dedicated to overthrowing the government			0
their leader was a powerful , thoughtful @entity156 tribesman who immediately astounded @entity13 with his politeness and humility			1
‘ he was 60 years old , i was just a boy from the farm , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ i saw the sometimes brutal way other guards treated the maximum security prisoners			2
i saw the way that @entity4 responded			1
‘ he would kneel down , uncomplaining , to sweep up the dust and dirt outside his cell when there was going to be an inspection			0
‘ he had a quietness and a mental discipline i ’d never seen before			0
i was a teenager and he called me “ mr brand ” with what seemed like real respect			0
‘ i was prepared to hate this man trying to bring us all down and ruin our country			0
instead i was won over by him very quickly			0
‘ i saw his suffering and near - desperation when we censored every word going to him or coming from him , and recorded every conversation he held			2
‘ i used to stand behind him during the few visits he was allowed and i could see the anguish in him when his beloved wife @entity25 was there , on the other side of a glass screen			0
i read all his letters to her and her replies to him			0
desperate attempt : @entity189 broke the rules when she attempted to smuggle in the baby , and she never knew that the mr @entity13 had brought the baby to @entity4 ‘ he was the clear leader of all the political prisoners and he never stopped trying to get their messages out to the rest of the world			1
but he also missed his wife and children , and their family life			0
’ @entity13 began to realise that @entity4 ’s humanity was psychologically reversing their roles			1
impressed with the unwavering regime that @entity4 imposed on himself – the morning exercise ; the tending of a vegetable patch he nurtured outside his cell ; the reading and studying when he was allowed an electric light ; the interminable passing of notes to his comrades through ever - more ingenious means – @entity13 found himself continually on the receiving end of overwhelming sympathy from the older man			1
‘ you had to respect him , the dignified way he accepted the rules and regulations , the way he never asked for any favours or showed anything but respect for me and my job , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ soon he was giving me advice and telling me i should study and achieve a better education and career			0
he seemed to want the best for me			0
‘ once , when he had been moved to @entity230 on the mainland , i came into his cell and saw a small container had been lowered into it through the slated windows			0
other prisoners were communicating with him in this way			2
‘ he looked at me and said , “ you need to report this			0
” he knew that i could n’t bend the rules without losing my job			2
new secure windows were fixed and they had to find another way to communicate			0
‘ i was often wired for sound when i entered his cell			0
when he offered to make me coffee or started to chat , which was not allowed , i would make a gesture to show we were being recorded			0
‘ we had a bond that way			0
i wanted to help him , i liked him and believed in him , and for his part he wanted to help me			0
’ @entity13 was relieved for @entity4 that he had died peacefully at home			1
‘ his home and family meant everything to him , ’ he says			0
family ties : @entity27 is the daughter of @entity4 's youngest child @entity259 , portrayed with him 2011 ‘ we talked a lot about those values , but i ’ve watched him fading over the years			1
now i ’ll never hear his voice again or see that bright smile			0
last time we met he teased me about my weight and said i should do more exercise			2
’ they also shared bleaker moments			0
like @entity4 , @entity13 suffered the loss of a son who died in a car accident			1
‘ he was the first to call me and try to comfort me , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity4 always had time to show he cared , he was always concerned about family matters even when he had the great weight of @entity277 affairs to deal with			1
’ he says that @entity4 would have enjoyed the scenes of dancing and singing in the streets that followed his death on thursday evening			1
‘ i wish i could have seen all the love coming to him from all over the world			0
’ @entity13 has written his own life story around his relationship with @entity4 , with the old man ’s blessing and encouragement			1
@entity4 – my prisoner , my friend , will be published next march			1
for the two of them it was the natural continuation of a solid friendship , built in the grim surroundings of a maximum security prison and lasting well into the final years of @entity4 ’s long life			1
the black freedom fighter prepared to die to liberate his people from a cruel regime , and the @entity301 farm boy born into that same regime			0
‘ through him i saw many human moments , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ that was our relationship , a series of small human moments that i now treasure more than ever			0
’ today he still takes the ferry daily to @entity7 where he supervises supplies to the tourist shops and runs the busy cafeteria			2
last friday he described how the island felt empty now @entity4 had gone			2
‘ i ’ve always felt he was still here in spirit , ’ he says			0
‘ i could still hear his voice sometimes and remembered all those painful times we shared when he was fighting for freedom and we were there to deprive him of it			0
‘ now we ’ll never see him here ever again			0
