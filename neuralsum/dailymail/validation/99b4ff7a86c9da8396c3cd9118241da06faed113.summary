@entity1 will try to form a second coalition with the @entity3 if he fails to get a majority , a senior cabinet minister has warned			1
education secretary @entity5 insisted there was ‘ no alliance ’ between the two coalition parties at the coming election , and said the coalition had made it more difficult for both parties to keep their promises			1
she stressed that an outright @entity16 win was still possible - and preferable - but said the @entity16 would make a new deal with the @entity3 work			1
education secretary @entity5 suggested the @entity16 were ready to make a deal with the @entity3 work mrs @entity20 told the @entity23 ’s @entity22 programme : ‘ i think if that ’s what the electorate presents us with i am sure we will try and make that work			1
i work with ( @entity3 schools minister ) @entity28 in the education department on a day by day basis			1
’ her comments are the clearest indication yet that the @entity16 leadership is laying the groundwork for a second deal with @entity36 if , as polls predict , the election produces another hung parliament			1
the move will prove hugely controversial with some senior @entity16 , who believe the party should try to go it alone in minority government if it emerges from the election as the largest party at @entity45 , rather than accept the inevitable compromises of coalition			2
. @entity49 mayor @entity48 told the @entity50 last week that mr @entity1 should categorically rule out another deal with the @entity3			1
‘ in my view we should say , “ stuff coalition with anyone ” , he said			0
‘ we are there to win , we are there to offer leadership , we are there to be a @entity61 government			0
‘ if we go into this issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party it would be absolutely fatal			0
’ it raises the prospect of a repeat of the scenes in may 2010 when @entity1 and @entity36 entered government together @entity16 mp @entity72 yesterday said mrs @entity20 was wrong to even countenance a second coalition with the @entity3			1
‘ i do n’t agree with her – i think we should try with a minority government if we fall short , ’ he said			0
‘ nobody has said to me , in the thousands of doors i have knocked on , that they want another coalition government			0
’ but a new poll of mps conducted by @entity81 , suggested that almost half of @entity80 ( 48 per cent ) would prefer to have another coalition with the @entity3 if the party fails to get a majority			2
just 26 per cent said the party should rule out a coalition			0
some 17 per cent said they would prefer a deal with @entity89			0
however , the survey found that just 29 per cent of @entity91 want to do another deal with the @entity16 , while 43 per cent would prefer a deal with @entity94 and 29 per cent would prefer to avoid any coalition at all			2
@entity49 mayor @entity48 last week urged mr @entity1 to categorically rule out another deal with the @entity3 the right - wing spectator magazine reported this week that mr @entity1 has already begun private discussions about forming a second coalition with mr @entity36			1
it said it was aware of ‘ at least two detailed discussions that @entity1 has had on the topic in recent weeks			2
he said the same in both – no matter what they might hear to the contrary , he does not want to run a minority government			0
’ however , the annual @entity108 found little enthusiasm for another five years of coalition , despite broad acceptance for many of the current @entity114 's reforms			0
the @entity116 survey found backing for the idea of coalition government had slumped to its lowest level for 30 years .			0

education secretary insists a @entity16 win is still possible - and preferable
but if @entity1 falls short of a majority a deal could be done with @entity3
@entity48 urged @entity1 to insist he is ready to govern alone
