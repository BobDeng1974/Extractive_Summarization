all you need is low , apparently			2
and who can argue ? @entity3 fans lined the streets of a sun - kissed @entity5 in their tens of thousands to welcome home the @entity9 champions ahead of the largest gathering the city has seen since 1990			1
perhaps even a year previous when the wall came down			2
there they waited at the tip of @entity15 – the scene of seven parties over the past month to celebrate the hexagon of wins , and that draw against @entity21 , over in @entity22 – for one final send off			1
some of the estimated half - a - million climbed traffic lights - one sat on the top of a @entity26 truck			2
the take on the @entity29 ’ @entity30 was emblazoned on a homemade banner , supplemented with ‘ we take a bow ’			2
it captured the feelings of a united nation			2
this achievement – decimating all in sight – can not be overestimated and is down in no small part to the meticulous planning and continued progression of their head coach , @entity42 , over the last eight years			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity3 's antics and dancing on stage as well as fan reaction on the open truck route around @entity5 ready and waiting : @entity3 's supporters await the arrival of the country 's @entity9 stars in @entity5 on tuesday morning now that 's a setting ! @entity55 - kissed @entity5 looked a picture on tuesday morning as the team enjoyed the adulation we 're back ! @entity60 leads out his team of the private @entity62 , with the steps decorated with a message ' @entity9 winners 2014 ' and four stars keep hold of that ! captain @entity60 grips the @entity9 trophy with @entity70 and @entity71 not far behind nice take : one fan raises a banner reading ' all you need is low , we take a bow ' before the likes of @entity71 and @entity78 made their appearance sight to behold : @entity15 's footballing centre was beginning to fill up very early in the morning as the screen replayed highlights of the final win and we 've landed ! the @entity3 side touched down at the airport @entity86 in @entity5 before making their way to greet delighted supporters you 've not nicked that , have you ? a fan holds a replica @entity9 aloft after getting right to the front of the queue to see his heroes is it a bird ? jubilant @entity97 clap and reach to the sky as the plane carrying the winning squad flies over the fan park before touching down despite all that , it 's unlike him to take any over-zealous adulation , with the 54 - year - old destined to leave that to his players			1
the victorious 23 - man squad were due to reach the fan park at 10am as pictures of them touching down at the city ’s airport at exactly 9.08am were met with a chorus of cheers at the heart of the capital			2
the hordes had to entertain themselves for a little while longer after the side 's flight from @entity123 was delayed by an hour after a luggage truck collided with the side of the aircraft - a fitting end to a chaotic tournament tenure for the @entity22 transport system			1
not that it bothered the players , although whether they would 've enjoyed the crowd 's harmony of @entity134 's @entity135 is highly questionable			1
they took the last part of the trip to the @entity15 , just over six miles on an open truck			0
the ' fan mile ' had started filling up hours before the arrival , with some waiting overnight to get a place at the front			1
' we 're all excited to see what it will be like , ' @entity70 told @entity149 television			1
' this time , thank @entity150 , we have the cup with us			1
' ' it will only sink in for us in the next few days			0
' photographers jostled for position just yards from the plane to capture skipper @entity60 - trophy in hand and aloft - stride down the steps decorated with ' @entity9 winners 2014 ' accompanied with four stars			1
yes , this is a side to have won three previous tournaments , but this has taken on special meaning given the previous dominance of @entity168 , a 24 - year wait and heartbreak in each of the last three			1
flags waved , children sat on their parents ' shoulders and people bobbed up and down in excitement			0
a player was yet to turn up ; this is a party that has gone on since the 113th minute of sunday night when pocked - sized @entity181 took two touches of sheer brilliance and wo n't finish for a good while yet			1
pleased : @entity184 ( left to right ) , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 on stage all smiles : coaching staff @entity192 ( left to right ) , @entity193 , assistant coach @entity194 and team manager @entity195 looking good , @entity196 ! low takes a spot in the cockpit of the delayed flight from @entity123 with pilots , the captain and @entity9 trophy proud as punch : @entity186 tweeted a couple of pictures - one when still on the plane with photographers waiting and another including @entity209 and @entity187 vantage point : one fan , @entity97 flag in one hand and phone the other , sits himself on top of a @entity26 truck to watch the action have this ! @entity185 ( next to @entity220 and @entity221 ) throws a scarf down to an adoring fan as players spilled out of the top of the truck final destination : they waited patiently in party mood for the victors to arrive at the iconic @entity15 later in the morning time out , please : construction workers take a little bit of a break from work as the truck passes the building they 're in all ready to board ? the players are whisked on to a team bus , that includes ' 2014 ! ' to mark their achievement in @entity239 give us a wave ! @entity186 ( left to right ) , @entity187 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 engage with the fans get the beers open ! @entity186 , @entity220 and @entity185 on the truck salute you , sir ! @entity71 greets the waiting crowds at the airport alongside central midfielders @entity70 and @entity189 make way ! the team bus starts to leave the airport as it descended on to the sea of supporters waiting and singing mean machine ! the @entity3 side cruised through the centre of @entity5 on this truck on their open top parade before taking the stage on the route : thousands of supporters lined the streets to welcome their team home after beating @entity268 on sunday video world champions @entity3 prepare for journey home thank you guys ! this female fan holds up a message towards the camera ahead of the players ' arrival at the fan mile the chronicles of @entity184 : the @entity281 striker poses alongside the @entity9 with @entity282 ( left ) and former @entity284 team - mate @entity283 rammed ! the side make their way through the public ahead of the big address later in the morning nice picture ! a man hangs out of a widow to capture @entity71 lift the trophy alongside mertesacker cool : @entity293 , @entity60 , @entity294 , @entity189 and @entity209 with the cup and ball as the @entity97 team return having a ball : @entity221 pretends to play the guitar as they entertain the huge crowd boy band material ? @entity71 ( right ) , @entity221 , @entity242 , @entity303 and @entity71 all get in on the guitar act applauds : @entity293 and @entity188 take in the atmosphere let 's all do the conga : the entire @entity3 side and backroom staff have a jolly around the stage the messiah : a battered and bruised @entity70 gees the crowds up even further draped in a @entity3 flag on the edge of the platform the truck slalomed through the packed streets of the city as @entity181 tweeted ' wow , what 's going on here ... @entity321 ! ' and @entity184 posed for his now customary photos			1
for the record , @entity70 and @entity283 were the unfortunate men involved this time			1
the @entity281 man finds himself on the end of a bit of stick for his social media prowess , but there is little doubt the forward who has 116 caps , 47 goals and has played for a decade for a decade is a key cog in this dressing room			0
' the most amazing moment of my career			0
a super 6 weeks , ' he enthused			0
his tweeting and thirst for pictures is clearly contagious			0
team - mate @entity186 followed suit as he gave his 7.4million @entity347 followers an on - truck glimpse as to what the morning felt like , posting pictures captioned ' back in the country of the world champions '			1
and they kept the tens of thousands on tenterhooks upon arriving at the gate , with several players peeking out its interior to have a look at the masses below			0
it felt like the unveiling of a royal baby at @entity361			0
that was until @entity363 hoch auf uns by @entity364 began to boom out along the mile			0
you would n't get that down @entity368			0
the chorus to that particular number is ' here 's to us , to this life , and this immortal moment '			2
when they finally made it on stage they were led by the bashful @entity193 , who said : ' it was a long way to the title , and a tough one too , but we 're delighted to be here with our fans			1
first , we would n't have got here without you			0
we are all world champions			0
' raise your hands : @entity78 ( left ) and @entity193 enjoy the rapturous applause as they are cheered along the route delight : @entity186 , @entity389 and @entity181 celebrate on the top of the party truck per @entity185 added : ' we 're super proud of what we 've achieved , especially after all we 've gone through			1
and we 're proud of these fans , ' before @entity188 whipped up the crowd			2
' i ca n't hear you @entity5 , ' he queried			0
that went up a notch once @entity209 took to the stage moments later , too			0
' @entity293 , @entity293 , @entity293 , you are the top man , ' he improvised in song			0
@entity5 erupted , as it 's likely to do throughout the day			2
probably the one after as well			0
@entity3 are world champions , and they know it .			0

@entity60 , @entity71 and @entity70 arrive at @entity86
fans had been queuing for an *advantageous* position overnight to catch a glimpse of their heroes
@entity193 's side won their first @entity9 for 24 years in @entity22
@entity181 's extra time winner against @entity268 was enough to clinch victory in the final
