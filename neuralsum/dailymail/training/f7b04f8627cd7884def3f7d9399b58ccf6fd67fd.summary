@entity0 is a 16 - year - old with a lousy attitude ; she swears at the teachers , wo n’t wear her school uniform and storms out of class when she ’s told off			1
but the platinum blonde is also the first of her family to almost reach the end of her school life without being expelled , and her teachers at the @entity13 are proud that she ’ll end up sitting her gcses			1
@entity0 is one of the ' stars ' of @entity17			1
@entity18 turns horrifying and heartwarming , this reality tv show makes fascinating viewing even if it is , at times , a little uncomfortable			1
tough job : headteacher @entity23 stars in @entity17 along with some of his charges filmed over eight weeks , it shows the inner workings of the comprehensive in @entity28 , @entity29 , from teachers ’ meetings to the school prom			1
each story is compelling , from the young @entity35 girl cramming for her gcses , to the bullied boy who ca n’t stop lashing out with his fists			1
at the heart of it all is no - nonsense head teacher @entity41 , who has a penchant for singing to himself			1
he ’s been at @entity43 for just under two years and he ’s determined to give his pupils a decent education and teach them how to be model citizens ; even if it ’s the last thing they want			1
the show is made by the same people who made 2011 ’s hit show educating @entity52			1
' there are universal themes in both shows , but i think you get a real flavour of @entity29 in our show , ' says @entity41			1
' @entity28 , to most people , has negative connotations but we wanted to do something to make our young children proud			1
we ’re trying very hard to make their lives better under difficult circumstances			1
' @entity28 has a 20 per cent unemployment rate and @entity41 estimates that 10 per cent of his pupils ’ parents are white collar workers ; the rest are blue collar and unemployed			1
half his students are of @entity35 , mainly @entity74 , origin while the rest are white @entity77			2
tv star : but mr @entity41 said they quickly forgot about the cameras a former failing school which is now rated ‘ good ’ by @entity82 , @entity43 was forecast to get 45 per cent @entity84 grades at @entity85 last year ; it actually managed 63 per cent			2
' i think we ’re doing a fantastic job and i wanted to put that across , ' says @entity41 of his reasons for agreeing to 65 cameras being placed in almost every corner of his school			2
' i think our kids are brilliant and they deserve to experience something a little bit different			2
' @entity41 says staff and pupils were only really aware of the cameras for the first few days			2
' in the first 20 minutes the kids were acting up but we told them you wo n’t be a tv star if you make all these obscene gestures and they stopped			2
' the prom thing is ridiculous , it 's quite obscene			2
a lot of our families are financially deprived but they all want to keep up with each other ' ' for the first two days it felt weird , but quite exciting			2
everyone was coming in with new hairdos			2
but then it was business as usual although , generally , behaviour improved a bit			2
it ’s still better than it was ; i think that ’s because they know the show ’s coming out and they do n’t want to let the side down			0
' the programme certainly shows the ups and downs of teaching			1
there are huge challenges , from the children whose behaviour constantly disrupts classes to the boy with a stutter who ’s terrified about how he ’ll cope with his oral examinations			0
there are also moments of farce and pathos , such as when @entity41 has to tell a boy ’s shocked mother that he has n’t behaved well enough to go to the school prom			0
she ’d already taken out a loan and shelled out £ 1,500 to hire a sports car and £ 2,000 on a suit for her son			0
' the prom thing is ridiculous , it ’s quite obscene , ' says @entity41			0
' a lot of our families are financially deprived but they all want to keep up with each other			0
they spend shedloads on a dress their daughters will never wear again			0
' in this media savvy world , the children and staff are going to become ‘ stars ’ in their own right – with all the potential online bullying that comes with it			0
@entity41 says the children have been well prepared			0
' we ’ll have a lot of support from the production company and @entity172 , who have given us a list of people the children can talk to individually			0
lots of the kids have been briefed beforehand and told what the impact might be			0
there ’s a huge support network			0
' reality bites : the show reveals the inner workings of a comprehensive in @entity28 over 100 schools volunteered to be featured , and it took ten months for @entity43 to be chosen and for its staff , pupils and parents to get to know the producers and be fully on board			1
' i know some people would call it a leap of faith , but i got to know the producers pretty well during that time			0
i think it speaks volumes about their professionalism that i was willing to stake my reputation and that of my colleagues on two people i ’ve only known for a few months			0
' although consent forms had to be signed at every stage of the process , the school had no editorial control and sometimes the teachers as well as the pupils are seen making mistakes			0
' it shows humanity , ' says @entity41			1
' yes it shows error , but it also shows people working hard			1
i do n’t think any of us come out of it at all badly			0
' @entity41 , who looks like a nightclub bouncer but actually began his working life as an accountant , is hoping the show will attract more pupils as the school ’s not quite fully subscribed			0
' i want to pull in nearby kids , and we can only do that by improving and being successful			0
this show will add kudos for us			0
