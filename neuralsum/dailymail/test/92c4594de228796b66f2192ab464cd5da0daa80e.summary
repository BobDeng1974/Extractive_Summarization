@entity0 will launch a multi-billion pound sale of @entity3 shares if he wins the election – in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the @entity8 era			1
the prime minister will today pledge that if he is returned to @entity11 he will offer the public £ 4 billion of @entity3 shares still held by the government after @entity16 ’s £ 20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers ’ money during the 2008 economic crisis			1
individuals will be allowed to buy up to £ 10,000 worth of @entity22 shares , which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on friday – comfortably above the 73.6p paid by mr @entity16 ’s government			1
it is the latest ‘ retro ’ @entity36 policy to hark back to the 1980s , following mr @entity0 ’s revival in the manifesto of the thatcherite ‘ right to buy ’ offer for housing association tenants			1
but while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as @entity46 and @entity47 – leading critics to claim that it encouraged ‘ carpetbaggers ’ – @entity3 shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding			1
a loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale , up to a maximum bonus value of £ 200			1
the sale of @entity3 shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when mrs @entity8 ’s government sold £ 3.9 billion of @entity47 shares and £ 5.6 billion of @entity46 shares in the famous ‘ @entity64 ’ campaign			1
thirty - three major companies were privatised under @entity8 between 1984 and 1991 , which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the @entity71			2
like @entity73 to buy , it also helped to entrench @entity36 support among voters who benefited from the windfalls			2
no 10 strategists hope mr @entity0 ’s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under mr @entity16 ’s premiership			1
the recovery under chancellor @entity84 has allowed him to sell £ 9 billion of shares in @entity3 to @entity87 investors for more than the price that former chancellor @entity89 paid in 2008			1
@entity90 : @entity91 and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election police are investigating a @entity36 mp over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake			2
@entity91 allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an @entity102 supermarket in his @entity104 constituency			2
@entity105 last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the @entity108 , which bans election candidates from providing food , drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes			2
the probe follows would - be @entity116 mp @entity115 , who is standing in @entity117 , being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year			2
detectives are expected to speak to mr @entity91 after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on april 2			0
he described the allegations as ‘ nonsense ’ , saying : ‘ we had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children , who are not even voters			0
’ there have been two sales to big pension funds and city institutions in 2013 and early in 2014			0
late last year , @entity137 , the @entity71 body that manages the @entity140 stake , hired investment bank @entity141 to sell a few million @entity3 shares in the market every day over a six month period – a practice known as a ‘ dribble - out ’			1
the government still owns £ 12.5 billion of @entity3 shares and experts expect £ 4 billion worth to be offered to the public , with the rest sold to @entity87 institutions			1
with the share price currently above 78p , the @entity153 will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer			0
however , while @entity3 has been a success story , the government ’s other big bank investment – @entity161 – has not			1
the @entity71 under mr @entity16 paid an average of 502p a share for @entity161 when it was rescued			0
they were changing hands on friday for 349p			0
in mr @entity0 ’s announcement today , he is expected to say : ‘ the £ 20 billion bailout of @entity3 by the last @entity170 government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the @entity174 economy under @entity170			1
after the public bailed it out , people feared they would n’t see their money returned			0
‘ today ’s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks , turning our economy around and reducing our national debt , only made possible by our long - term economic plan			0
‘ that ’s why it is so important that we do n’t put all that progress at risk , but instead build on what we ’ve done so we can deliver a brighter , more secure future for our country			0
’ @entity194 : a ' beater ' at work and below , a bottle of @entity198 the prime minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his @entity205 constituency home			0
and he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘ @entity209 ’ cocktail			0
but witnesses say that @entity0 did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman			1
instead , he acted as a ‘ beater ’ to flush out the game			0
the event took place on @entity219 but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret			0
it took place near @entity209 , the @entity205 town which has given its name to the ‘ @entity209 set ’ of high - profile local residents from the world of politics , media and showbusiness such as mr @entity0 and @entity231			1
last night , the man who served mr @entity0 the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘ country walk ’ had no idea there would be a vip guest			2
@entity240 , master distiller at the @entity242 ‘ artisanal ’ gin company @entity198 , said : ‘ no one but the landowner knew the prime minister would be joining us			0
’ he fought shy of describing the event as a shoot , but added : ‘ i can say with utter certainty that mr @entity0 did not handle a gun			2
’ mr @entity16 confirmed , though , that the pm did sample the cocktail , based on @entity252			0
last night , the drink , also containing manuka honey , raspberry tea and extract of echinacea , was being dubbed the ‘ @entity209 cocktail ’ .			0
