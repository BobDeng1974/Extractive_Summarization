@entity35 missed @entity2 's second but @entity37 passed up the chance to seal the win when his tame fifth effort was kept out by @entity41 , who had made a string of impressive saves throughout the game			2
how cruel , therefore that the @entity46 goalkeeper - who won the competition with @entity48 two years ago - thrashed his own penalty against the bar and could not keep out @entity52 's effort as @entity7 made it through			1

' the @entity85 was also left bemoaning a decision to not award his side a penalty when they were 2 - 1 up in extra-time			1
' you can see why he gave the two yellow cards ( to @entity15 ) but there is no justification in how the referee has not seen ( that ) @entity23 ' free - kick was in the box , ' he added			2
' he has given a free - kick outside the box and clearly it 's in the box			2
the linesman has given it and should 've seen the action in the box			0
' @entity0 's opposite number @entity73 described the topsy - turvy contest as ' unbelievable ' as it showcased the magic of the cup			1

in the end we got what we deserved , there is no doubt about that			0
' unfortunately we missed too many chances , their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves			0
we had 23 , 24 attempts			0
we missed and fluffed a few and had to rely on penalties in the end to win it			0
' @entity2 have been a bit of a bogey team for us and when @entity37 missed it i thought ' here we go again '			2
