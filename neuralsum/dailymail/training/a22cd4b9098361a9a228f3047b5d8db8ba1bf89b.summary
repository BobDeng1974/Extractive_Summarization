by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 07:32 est , 16 february 2013 @entity2 and his fourth wife @entity1 having lunch near their £ 1.7million @entity5 house like many a would - be author before him , @entity2 is discovering a multitude of distractions to avoid the taxing business of putting pen to paper			1
one day this week , for example , @entity13 ’s black - sheep uncle was to be found enjoying a long and leisurely lunch with friends at the £ 100 - a - head panoramic restaurant at the top of @entity20 building in @entity21			1
other times , he can be spied tucking into his favourite duck egg and chicken livers starter at the ultra-smart @entity25 in @entity26			2
whatever the venue , the high - living @entity27 , who revels in the nickname @entity29 , likes nothing better than to indulge his taste for fine wine , a favourite being a smooth 1999 - vintage @entity35 — a snip at £ 90			1
in truth , it is hard to imagine that multi-millionaire @entity27 , the younger brother of @entity13 ’s mother , @entity40 , is stuck for things to write as he begins the task of penning his juicy memoirs			2
after all , he could start with his infamous encounter with the @entity46 ’s ‘ @entity45 ’ at 47 - year - old @entity2 ’s colourfully named @entity48 home , @entity49 , during which @entity27 was caught on camera snorting cocaine and offering to get the paper ’s undercover reporter drugs and @entity55 prostitutes			1
or perhaps he could commit to the page his romantic fourth wedding seven months ago to his auburn - haired girlfriend @entity1			1
the prospect of reading his account of either event is likely , it has to be said , to have sent a chill down the spine of the social - climbing mrs @entity13 as she reclined with her daughter and son - in - law , prince @entity65 , on the @entity67 island of @entity68 this week			2
neither @entity40 nor the royal couple were present when tattooed @entity2 — who like his sister was raised in a @entity72 council house — tied the knot in @entity21 with 43 - year - old @entity74 last july			1
mr @entity2 's niece @entity75 and @entity65 were not at his recent wedding mr @entity2 ( left ) claims that @entity1 - @entity1 ( right ) is the one for him and that this marriage will succeed where his others did n't and the new mrs @entity27 undoubtedly represents a rather colourful addition to the @entity13 clan			1
she is a convicted fraudster who siphoned off £ 250,000 from a luxury car firm , where she worked as a clerk , and blew the loot on @entity85 watches and @entity87 sports cars			1
mr @entity2 rather sheepishly admitted to me this week : ‘ the wedding was a very quiet affair			1
@entity40 and @entity13 were not there			2
there were just four very close , dear friends			0
but we are going to celebrate it properly next year with a big bash			0
’ what ’s the betting , though , that @entity40 and the royal couple — who holidayed with entrepreneur @entity27 at his @entity100 pleasure palace in 2006 , but publicly cut ties with him after the embarrassing drug revelations — find they have other plans that day ? @entity105 and her husband @entity106 on the day their daughter 's engagement was announced			0
the family cut ties with mr @entity2 after the drug scandal certainly , the re-emergence of @entity40 ’s troublesome sibling onto the public radar , with his plans for a tell - all book , is something the ambitious mrs @entity13 , 58 , could well do without			1
after all , she and @entity13 ’s father , @entity106 , who run a lucrative party merchandise firm , have recently moved even further up in the world by splashing out £ 4.7 million to become lord and lady of a grand manor house in the rolling @entity126 countryside			2
and what @entity40 makes of her new sister - in - law is anyone ’s guess			2
born in @entity131 , @entity132 , miss @entity1 — who was also brought up in a council house — bears the blinged - up , perma - tanned look of someone who , after a troubled past , has finally landed on her feet			1
over the past two years , @entity1 — who favours @entity140 handbags , plunging tops , and sports suspiciously inflated breasts and lips — has been a regular fixture at @entity49 , which @entity27 has just put on the market for 6.5 million euros ( £ 5.6 million )			1
she developed a rather unlikely taste for the finer things in life in the mid-nineties while earning £ 11,000 a year in the accounts department of the @entity153 car dealership in @entity154 , @entity132			1
mr @entity2 's infamous £ 5.6million @entity48 holiday home , @entity158 de @entity156 the house has become popular with footballers and those looking to party on the island unbeknown to her bosses , she siphoned off cash that she spent on jewellery , including a £ 12,500 @entity85 watch , a £ 41,000 @entity87 sports car , plus holidays in @entity170 and trips to @entity172 in @entity173			1
when her ruse was finally rumbled , she admitted five charges of theft and asked for 52 similar offences to be taken into consideration at her trial at @entity180 in 1996			0
but she escaped jail and was given a suspended sentence after the judge was told she had endured a troubled and deprived childhood			0
clearly , however , her liking for the trappings of money and privilege stuck , and subsequently she has dated a string of rich and successful men , including a self - made communications millionaire called @entity192 , with whom she lived in a property beside @entity21 ’s @entity195 before he was declared bankrupt in august 2010			2
mr @entity2 now says that he would have a ' nosebleed ' if he left a @entity198 postcode she then moved on to @entity27 , who made a fortune in 2005 by selling his recruitment firm , @entity200 , for £ 275 million			1
as well as the @entity48 retreat , they also share his £ 1.7 million mews house in @entity204			2
ominously for mrs @entity13 — and royal courtiers who consider her brother a loose cannon — @entity27 once more finds himself unemployed and with time to kill after abruptly parting company with it recruitment company @entity210 last month following less than a year in their employ			0
since then , it seems he has returned to the freewheeling , hedonistic lifestyle that got him into so much trouble in 2009 when he fell victim to the now - defunct tabloid ’s sting			2
with that in mind , perhaps , in recent weeks he has been touting himself around firms in the same field in the hope of getting another position			0
but he denies he ’s looking for a job , or that deciding to sell up in @entity228 has anything to do with strained finances , and insisted to me this week that he is in the market for as big a property in @entity21 ’s @entity234			0
mr @entity2 told me : ‘ i ’m selling @entity48 just because i ’m smart with my money			1
it ’s a really good time to be selling something in @entity238 and buying something in pounds			0
‘ it ’s just me changing my focus and my profile and i ’m definitely buying something bigger in @entity21			0
if i move out of the @entity198 postcode i get a nosebleed ! ‘ i parted company with @entity210 on the best possible terms , so we ’re all very cool			0
i ’ve had non-executive job offers left , right and centre since then , but i ’m catching up with friends at the moment			0
‘ i ’ve not needed to work for a very long time			0
in fact , for a while , i watched so much @entity255 [ a @entity257 courtroom reality show ] on daytime tv , i thought i could pass the bar exam			0
that ’s why i wanted to do something with @entity210 and i ’m sure i ’ll do something again soon			0
the royals wo n't be happy to hear about mr @entity2 's plan to sell his memoirs ‘ i have a got a few personal projects , but at the moment i ’m just chilling out and just having some fun for a bit			1
’ one of those projects is the writing of his book , for which he has not yet sought a publisher , but which , he assured me this week , will ‘ tell the world the whole story ’ of his colourful life thus far			1
however , @entity27 ’s planned revelations , plus , you would think , his choice of wife , threaten to see him banished once more into the cold after the royal couple tentatively invited him back into their fold			0
despite his @entity46 humiliation , he was on the guest - list at @entity65 and @entity13 ’s wedding in april 2011 , to which he turned up in a £ 280,000 bright blue @entity291 convertible			1
but , notably , rather than taking his then new lover , miss @entity1 , he arrived with second wife @entity293 and their daughter , @entity296 , now 11 , who is one of @entity13 ’s favourite cousins			1
he was divorced from wife number three , blonde accountant @entity300 , 35 , just days before the revelations of his drug - taking at @entity49 , whose wall bears a 6ft - high mural proclaiming : ‘ it ’s @entity2 ’s world , you just live in it			1
’ at the time , @entity27 was living on the @entity307 island with a former lapdancer called @entity309			0
despite , or possibly because of , the house ’s notoriety , it has become popular with @entity314 footballers , and @entity316 and @entity317 star @entity315 rented it last summer			0
according to @entity27 , his recent fourth wedding will be his last : ‘ we ’re very much in love and this one ’s a keeper , ’ he told me this week			0
‘ we have just celebrated six months and it ’s all been very cool			0
it was just the right thing to do			0
i wo n’t be having any more kids , though , i ’m very happy with my daughter @entity296 , she ’s epic			0
’ no doubt , his big sister @entity40 might have been hoping that with the imminent sale of his infamous @entity228 playground , her problems with bothersome @entity2 might be over			1
but with that tell - all book and colourful new bride , she might just have to think again			2
whether @entity2 and his fraudster wife will be smiling proudly in the @entity336 pictures when a new heir to the throne arrives in the summer remains to be seen .			2

@entity2 married @entity1 - @entity1 , who swindled her bosses out of £ 250,000
she spent the cash on a @entity85 , a @entity87 and holidays to @entity170
@entity2 is also set to write a tell all book about his life
