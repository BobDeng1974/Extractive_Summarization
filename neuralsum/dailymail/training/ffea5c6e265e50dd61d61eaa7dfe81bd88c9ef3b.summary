six breast cancer drugs are to be banned from use by @entity3 patients - promoting condemnation from campaigners and doctors			1
thousands of women with advanced breast cancer are set to be denied ‘ last chance ’ medication that can give them extra months , if not years , with their loved ones			1
the six drugs are being taken off an approved list by the @entity15 , which was set up after a @entity17 election pledge to improve access to vital medicines in @entity20			0
banned from @entity3 : @entity21 is one of six breast cancer drugs deemed to offer either ‘ insufficient value for money ’ or or have poor cost - benefit scores for breast cancer the £ 280million a year @entity15 ( @entity27 ) which began in april 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in @entity20 getting drugs banned on the @entity3 by @entity30 , the rationing body			1
@entity20 , which took over its administration a year ago , has re-evaluated 25 drugs used in 42 treatments			0
it is understood that eribulin , @entity21 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have been deemed to offer ‘ insufficient value for money ’ or have poor cost - benefit scores for breast cancer			1
one in six patients treated through the fund has advanced breast cancer , with 2,000 getting eribulin alone			1
trial data shows the drug , derived from sea sponges , extends the life of women with an especially aggressive form of the disease by almost five months on average			0
the ban may see thousands with advanced breast cancer denied ‘ last chance ’ medication around half of women live longer than a year after getting eribulin , which costs around £ 10,000 for a six - month course of treatment			1
the drug is prescribed as standard care to women in 55 countries , including all major @entity68 members , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
other cancer drugs have also been axed , with full details to be released next week			1
some drug companies have been told they must agree by monday to cut their prices if they want their products reprieved ( to subs please keep )			0
but the @entity27 review of eribulin has concluded it does not work well enough to justify routine use – a decision that can not be appealed except by seeking a judicial review			0
professor @entity83 from the @entity84 , who presented evidence on the drug last month to the @entity27 , said its decision came ‘ @entity89 ’			2
regulatory authorities worldwide approved the drug ’s efficacy and safety , and the @entity27 ’s rationale was inexplicable , he said			0
‘ it came as a complete shock			0
@entity97 is standard treatment in guidelines from all the leading cancer bodies so it is difficult to understand how the @entity27 made this decision			0
‘ i saw a woman in my clinic this morning who has been taking it successfully for six months after other drugs failed and she said there was ‘ nothing to compare ’			2
‘ it goes against natural justice for there to be no appeal mechanism and such a closed process ’ he added			2
consultant oncologist dr @entity116 , from the @entity115 , said an audit found the drug ’s real - life performance matched trial data , with one in four patients taking it for more than two years			0
he said ‘ this is now standard of care for women with advanced breast cancer who have no alternative			1
’ although existing patients would continue to be treated , new patients would have to be ‘ exceptional ’ cases to get de-listed drugs			1
but , said dr @entity116 , clinicians would face ‘ @entity136 ’ as exceptional requests were possible only for fewer than 20 patients			2
@entity137 , 63 , who lives in @entity138 , has been taking eribulin for advanced breast cancer since september and knows she ’s on borrowed time			1
mrs @entity137 , who is divorced and had administrative jobs in the @entity3 for 32 years , said ‘ i ’ve been aware it was terminal right from the off			0
‘ i ’ve been on a number of drugs that stopped working			2
i said to my oncologist in september : ‘ i ’ve got a wedding to go to in november ’ and i made it			2
‘ my only daughter @entity149 was getting married – and i ’m still here five months on			0
i feel terrible that other women may not get the opportunity i had			0
’ @entity152 , head of policy at @entity155 charity , said ‘ this re-evaluation process is a warning sign that the entire fund is unravelling			0
‘ we are extremely concerned that breast cancer drugs could be removed			1
‘ it would be soul destroying for many secondary breast cancer patients if they were unable to access these drugs simply due to cost			1
‘ we hope that the announcement is a positive one - all cancer patients deserve to benefit from clinically effective treatments			1
