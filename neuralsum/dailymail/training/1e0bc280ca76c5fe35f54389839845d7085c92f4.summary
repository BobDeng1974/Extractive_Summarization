by @entity0 one of @entity2 ’s most senior police chiefs has called for an end to the war on drugs			1
@entity6 chief constable @entity6 said all drugs , including heroin and cocaine , should be decriminalised and made available through the @entity10 – destroying the power base and income of criminal gangs			1
mr @entity6 acknowledged drugs were ‘ bad ’ but compared the current policy to the prohibition of alcohol in 1920s @entity18 that gave rise to @entity20 and the mafia			1
he said efforts to reduce illicit drugs had ‘ comprehensively failed ’ and the effect of criminalisation of the trade had been to put millions of pounds into the pockets of criminals			1
reform : @entity6 chief constable @entity6 has urged for a rethink in the way drugs are policed , comparing our current laws to 1920 's @entity18 prohibition he said last night : ‘ if an addict were able to access drugs via the @entity10 or something similar , then they would not have to go out and buy illegal drugs			1
buying or being treated with , say , diamorphine [ heroin ] is cheap			0
it ’s cheap to produce it therapeutically			0
‘ not all crime gangs raise income through selling drugs , but most of them do in my experience			2
so offering an alternative route of supply to users cuts their income stream off			0
they should not , of course , be freely available			0
‘ i think addiction to anything – drugs , alcohol , gambling , etc – is not a good thing , but outright prohibition hands revenue streams to villains			1
since 1971 [ the @entity67 ] , prohibition has put billions into the hands of villains who sell adulterated drugs on the streets			1
‘ in my force area we have 43 organised crime groups on our radar			0
most have their primary source of income in illicit drug supply , all of them are involved in some way			0
‘ these criminals are often local heroes and role models for young people who covet their wealth			0
‘ decriminalising their commodity will immediately cut off their income stream and destroy their power , ’ mr @entity6 said in an article in today ’s @entity84			2
‘ have we not learned the lessons of prohibition in history ? @entity98 ’s sinister rise to prominence in the @entity18 was pretty much funded through its supply of a prohibited drug – alcohol			1
that ’s arguably what we are doing in the @entity105			0
’ access : chief constable @entity6 called for cocaine to be made available on the @entity10 , saying that the criminalisation of drugs like it has put millions of pounds into the hands of criminals ( file picture ) mr @entity6 , an experienced crimefighter who was appointed to the chief constable post earlier this year after serving as assistant , said addicts should be treated rather than criminalised			1
he said : ‘ if you started to give a heroin addict the drug therapeutically , then we would not have the scourge of hepatitis c and @entity124 spreading among needle users , for instance			0
i am calling for a controlled environment , not a free - for - all			0
’ he is not the first chief constable to call for a change in drug policy			2
in 2010 , @entity131 , chief constable of @entity133 police , said the criminal justice system could offer only a ‘ limited ’ solution to the scourge of drugs .			2

@entity139 police chief @entity6 called for a *relaxation* of drug laws
he compared current *legislation* to that of 1920 's @entity18 prohibition
the criminalisation of drugs puts ' millions ' into hands of criminals , he said
