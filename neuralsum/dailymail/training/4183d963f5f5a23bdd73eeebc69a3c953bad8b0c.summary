@entity0 is no stranger to the fashion industry			1
the 25 - year - old has modeled for fashion labels such as @entity4 and jewellery treasure trove @entity6 and is a regular on the front rows of @entity8			1
but now - finally ! - the stylish @entity11 socialite and business woman has released her very own clothing line			1
here @entity0 wears the patterned shift dress £ 90 today sees the launch of @entity0 's first ever fashion collection - @entity0			1
following eight months of design and development the capsule collection consists of 40 unique pieces including dresses , tops , jumpsuits and jackets			2
@entity0 who certainly has a keen eye on the industry , and has had a hands - on approach from the label 's beginnings says it has been a hectic couple of months to get the collection ready			1
@entity0 has taken inspiration from her own wardrobe for the collection			1
@entity39 wears @entity0 has included a few investment pieces to be worn season after season such as this jacket £ 250 ' i have been working on it for eight months			2
' says @entity0 , ' usually designers take years before they launch a collection but we wanted to create a capsule line			1
' we originally only wanted to do 20 pieces but we have ended up with 40 so it has been a bit of a whirlwind			0
' @entity0 's collection does n't look dissimilar to her typical outfit choices and that 's because it is n't			1
when it came to design inspiration @entity0 says she looked no further than yours truly			1
' i wanted the collection to represent me and i created it for myself really			2
it features a lot of embellishment which i love and we have some faux leather look pants and shorts			0
' i really love the whole 60s and 70s look and that is reflected in the collection			2
it has quite a boho and vintage style , i wanted it to be quite young and fun			0
' model behaviour : millie models the entire collection herself the capsule collection is made up of 40 pieces and took @entity0 8 months to design and develop @entity0 hopes that her clothing line will attract the likes of @entity83 and @entity84			1
high - slit maxi skirt £ 59 for @entity0 versatility was hugely important in her range			1
she wanted pieces that would stand the test of time so that her customers were n't forking out for a new wardrobe each season			2
' i wanted the collection to be quite timeless so that women could get a lot of wear out of them			0
there is that investment feel with a few pricier pieces			0
' we have some really lovely blouses in black and cream that you can dress up in different ways			0
i wanted it so that you could take it from the office to the dance floor			0
' for the fashion fanatic her collection has been a long time coming having always dreamt of owing her own boutique and creating her own clothes with a sewing machine as a child			2
' this has always been my dream since i was little , to have my own shop			0
but we have been really lucky in getting it out there on the high street			0
' mrs professor @entity126 is thrilled to finally be able to show off her designs after months of planning and says that the initial reaction has been really positive			0
@entity0 says that having her own clothing line has been a lifelong dream			1
here she wears the double breasted lurex waistcoat £ 140 ' it is so exciting but it is also so surreal to finally have it out after just working towards it			0
up until now i have only been allowed to tease people but i have had a great response from my friends which i always think is the most important			0
' i was really worried about showing them because if your friends do n't like it then you have n't got a chance ! but they were really impressed so that was great			0
' @entity0 's is a style that many try to emulate themselves with the internet flooded with blogs instructing fans on how to get her look			2
when it comes to who she wants to see in her collection @entity0 has high hopes			1
' someone said to me today that they could see @entity83 wearing it which would just be amazing ! she would make the collection sell out ! i could see @entity84 wearing it because the collection has a glamorous and girly feel			2
' other than celebrity aspirations @entity0 is looking forward to being able to wear the range herself after having to keep it under wraps for months			1
' i have n't been allowed to wear my collection until now ! i have only just been allowed to have the samples that have been stored at the factory			0
' we were worried that people would see pictures of me wearing them and cheaper designers would create knock - offs really quickly which we really did n't want			0
i am in @entity180 this week to see a few shows so it will be great to finally have my clothes to wear for that			1
' despite her busy year , it appears that launching a clothing line is n't enough for ambitious @entity0 who also has plans to add author to her résumé			1
' i have my lifestyle book coming out next year but i actually need to write it ! i have a lot of travelling plans though so there will be no champagne and movies on the flight and instead i will just have to work and write the thing ! ' for now though having finally realised her life long dream @entity0 says she could n't be happier			2
' i love my work			0
people always say love what you do for a living and i absolutely do , i am living the dream and it is a dream come true			0
' @entity0 's clothing collection is available in sizes 6 - 16 and is available to purchase at www.millie-mackintosh.com as well as other major @entity213 retailers from the october 15			1
