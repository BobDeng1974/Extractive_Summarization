@entity8 editor @entity55 last month ‘ stepped aside ’ as the corporation probed the bloody aftermath of the decision to drop an investigation last year into the @entity60 claims			1

they pointed out that the decision , post @entity45 , to effectively sideline executives such as @entity109 , who spent last weekend on a walking holiday , has left the corporation bereft of high - level journalist experience			0
mr @entity2 is described by @entity4 chairman @entity38 as ‘ a very good man ’ and is no stranger to media scandals			1
