a @entity1 trench system covering an area the size of two football fields could be built in the @entity6 countryside			1
proposals for a ' living museum ' in @entity9 would see over half a mile of both @entity11 and @entity12 trenches , complete with their own no - man 's land , built just off the @entity14			1
the @entity15 for the @entity1 would also have nine training huts and would allow schoolchildren to visit and experience the day - to - day life of soldiers during the 1914 - 1918 conflict			2
dr @entity21 has submitted plans for this museum in @entity24 which would see over half a mile of trenches and nine training huts built just off of the @entity14 due to open in august 2014 to make the centenary of the @entity1 the trenches and training huts - both @entity30 and @entity12 - would be built to authentic plans with minor adjustments to make them safe for the public if proposals go ahead visitors would be dressed in replica @entity1 uniforms and allowed to hold replica weapons , then guided through the site by historical experts and re-enactors			1
the site will even feature a tank - which is currently parked on founder dr @entity21 's driveway - and a miniature railway			1
dr @entity21 , a biologist and amateur historian , said : ' @entity47 has now moved into history			0
there are no survivors of the @entity1 left , so you ca n't go and talk to those guys anymore			0
' we are stewards for this history and we need to pass that on to the next generation			0
' dr @entity21 is a biologist and amateur historian who has a replica @entity1 tank on his driveway this tank will form part of the ' living museum ' which would allow visitors a glimpse into the everyday lives of soldiers during the conflict it will be the only one of its kind in @entity11 and the most extensive in @entity71 , and could be open as early as august next year , in time for the centenary of the start of the @entity1			1
the project has taken four years of research and planning to get to this point , and will cost Â£ 2million , all of it privately funded			0
the trenches and training huts will all be based on actual plans from @entity12 and @entity11 military manuals from the time , with minor alterations to make them safer			1
dr @entity21 added : ' existing trenches are nicely grassed over and have pretty gardens attached so for someone going to the @entity90 it is difficult to imagine what a trench was like			2
' we looked at sites in @entity95 and @entity96 but planning applications were so onerous it could 've taken 20 years			0
' we decided the best place was in @entity11 to provide a place for children who can not afford to go to the @entity90			0
' the government has put aside money to send children there , but it is only enough for two children and one teacher from each state school			0
we wanted to provide another option			0
' @entity11 troops suffered through the war in terrible conditions in makeshift trenches that stretched from @entity96 to @entity114 there are no survivors left from the @entity1 so it is up to the next generation to keep the history alive and make sure the soldiers are remembered it is hoped up to 300,000 visitors would flock to the museum annually , making it a viable business which will not use any public funding			1
dr @entity21 said he and his co-founder , @entity128 , decided not to use public money as it is already stretched between other projects			0
the museum will also feature exhibits documenting local @entity1 history , including the lives of famous figures from @entity135 who fought in the conflict , such as poet @entity138			1
the @entity135 held a unique place in the history of the @entity1 as it had students serve as officers on both @entity12 and @entity30 sides			1
@entity30 troops , like these @entity95 grenadiers , lived , fought and died in huge trench systems dug during @entity1 after the @entity148 in september , 1914 , the @entity12 army was forced to retreat to the @entity149			1
the commander decided that his troops must at all costs hold onto those parts of @entity95 and @entity96 that they still occupied			0
the men were ordered to dig trenches that would provide them with protection from the advancing @entity95 and @entity11 troops			2
the @entity158 soon realised that they could not break through this line and they also began to dig. after a few months these trenches had spread from the @entity161 to the @entity162			2
as the @entity12 were the first to build , they had been able to choose the best places			1
the possession of the higher ground not only gave the @entity12 a tactical advantage , but it forced the @entity11 and @entity95 to live in the worst conditions			1
most of this area was rarely a few feet above sea level			0
as soon as soldiers began to dig down they would invariably find water two or three feet below the surface			0
water - logged trenches were a constant problem for soldiers on the @entity90 leading to the spread of lice and so - called ' trench foot ' , where constantly soaking boots lead to soldiers feet literally rotting off the bone			2
it would take the loss of millions of lives and the invention of the tank by the @entity11 army before the formidable system was finally broken four years after it was built .			2

over half a mile of @entity30 and @entity12 trenches to be built in @entity24
area is the size of two football fields and includes no - man 's land
' living museum ' will also feature replica tank and mini railway
could be open by august 2014 if *permission* is granted
