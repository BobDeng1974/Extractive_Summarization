by @entity0 @entity1 has opened up for the first time about the figure skating scandal that shook the @entity5 world 20 years ago , and said she was shocked to think @entity6 could be behind it because the pair ' were friendly			1
' in 1994 , @entity1 was clubbed in the knee at the @entity10 by @entity6 's ex-husband @entity11 and a hit squad to try to keep her from skating against her rival in the @entity14			1
@entity1 , who recovered and went on to win a silver medal at the games , said she really wanted to believe @entity6 was n't involved in the bizarre plot that made worldwide headlines			1
' i truly wanted to believe that she had nothing to do with it at all , ' the 44 - year - old said on @entity22 monday			0
' because how could that seem possible that someone you know , i mean we were competitors , but ... we were friendly			0
so to think that anyone you know would deliberately try to hurt you , yeah , it 's too bizarre to understand			1
@entity38 quivering and hands fidgeting , @entity1 first watched the one - hour retrospective at a press screening in @entity42			1
many entertained the idea that @entity6 was linked to the clumsy attack			1
and even after @entity11 and two associates were arrested , @entity1 gave harding the benefit of the doubt			1
' i can remember saying even to the @entity51 , " well , maybe @entity6 really did n't know			1
maybe they did it for her			0
' and they 're like , " @entity1 , we ca n't prove it , but we think she was the mastermind of the whole thing			2
" ' at that point , she said she felt ' disappointment , sadness			0
' and while @entity6 still denies having any role , @entity1 said she does n't believe her			1
' why would the people around her want to hurt me ? ' she said on @entity22			0
' what did they have to gain ? i guess she 's the only one who really had anything to gain			2
and i was told " i know we ca n't prove it but we 're telling you			0
" i hated hearing it			0
it 's sad on so many levels			2
' when asked if she has forgiven @entity6 for what happened , she said she does n't think about it , being a busy mom - of - three			2
but forgiven , she has n't			0
' i do n't know			0
i do n't think about it really			0
when i read transcripts from the @entity51 , they planned to kill me at one point			0
that was one of the options			0
to kill me over a sporting event			0
that 's crazy , ' she said			2
' there were all these other brutal options that they were thinking about doing to me			0
i 've moved on i do n't think about it as forgiveness			2
i just hope she 's happy ... and can be able to move on			2
stars : @entity1 , left and right , and @entity6 were two of the brightest stars in @entity96 figure skating when they arrived in @entity98 for the @entity96 championships in 1994 , about six weeks ahead of the @entity14 brutal : @entity1 , right , was knocked out of the competition when an associate of the ex-husband of rival @entity6 , left , whacked her on the right knee with a baton did n't believe it : @entity1 , left , said this week that she never believed @entity6 , right , was involved , even when the @entity51 thought she was the ' mastermind ' at the press screening of the documentary in @entity42 friday , it was clear that watching the events unfold again all these years later brought bubbling back to the surface those same feelings of helplessness and bewilderment			1
' it made me think about everything all over again , ' @entity1 said after the screening of ' @entity1			1
' ' it 's surprising how this whole event and being attacked , it 's changed not just skating , it changed my life			2
it changed tabloid journalism , reality television			0
that whole other aspect that i had no part of			0
it just moved the world , almost , in a different direction			2
whether it 's for the better or not , who knows ? it just changed everything			2
' @entity1 and @entity6 were two of the brightest stars in @entity96 figure skating when they arrived in @entity98 for the @entity96 championships in 1994 , about six weeks ahead of the @entity14			1
@entity1 was knocked out of the competition when an associate of @entity6 's ex-husband whacked her on the right knee with a baton			1
it touched off a staggering scandal that pushed figure skating into the mainstream and made the camera - shy @entity1 the uncomfortable subject of international fascination			1
@entity1 recovered in time to win a silver medal in @entity151 , while @entity6 spun out of control			1
' it 's a little surreal to watch your life and to think , " that 's me , " ' @entity1 , who works for @entity37 as a skating analyst for the @entity159 , said after watching the show			1
' it 's almost like a whole other person at this point			2
well , i have n't changed really much , just moved on			0
things in my life are different			0
i 'm basically the same sort of competitive person , but it 's just things move on			0
' over it : ' i 've apologized so many times , ' @entity6 , pictured here in 1994 , said dismissively in the documentary			1
' she is not worth my time anymore			1
' he ex-husband , @entity11 , right , was arrested after the attack not forgiven : @entity1 said she hardly thinks about @entity6 , pictured in the documentary , these days but she does n't forgive her attack : former @entity5 figure skater @entity1 speaks after a screening of a new documentary about the 1994 attack on her as @entity6 parlayed the incident into a circus sideshow sort of celebrity that included televised boxing matches and guest commentary spots on hockey tv shows , @entity1 , a married mom of three , retreated to the cocoon of family life			1
she almost never spoke publicly about her experience until just recently as the 20th anniversary approached			0
during the screening , a dozen or so people sat near the front of the room			0
but @entity1 sat near the back , out of sight while she watched the show recap her rise from modest means to skating stardom ; the ' whack heard ' round the world ' that jeopardized her @entity5 chances ; and @entity6 talk about a hard - scrabble upbringing while continuing to deny she had any role in the attack on @entity1			1
' i 've apologized so many times , ' @entity6 said dismissively in the show			1
' she is not worth my time anymore			1
' ' when you see someone struggle from the beginning , that 's hard and i feel for her , ' @entity1 said			1
' it does n't excuse poor judgment			0
i hope now , after all this , for not just my sake but her sake , too			0
you 've got to allow people that chance to get on with their lives and try to be better and learn from mistakes			0
' as much as she expressed a desire to move past it friday , there were times when it was clear that there is still some lingering pain and resentment for @entity1			1
when journalist @entity236 , who interviewed both @entity1 and @entity6 for the piece , was asked about @entity6 's persistent denial of involvement in the assault , @entity1 interjected with an exasperated chuckle			1
' would n't it be weird to change it now ? ' @entity1 said			2
one of the toughest parts for @entity1 was to see how some portrayed her as ' an ice princess , ' a robotic , occasionally snarky competitor who was mocked for her cries of ' why ? why ? ' when she was struck on the knee and when microphones caught her calling a parade at @entity252 ' corny			1
' ' i remember how that felt , ' @entity1 said			2
' so watching it , it 's upsetting			0
why are people like that ? i do n't understand			0
' she said she 's always been a private person , so when the world turned its camera lens on her in 1994 , the harsh light that shined with it was difficult for her to handle			1
she felt the picture that was painted was unfair and unflattering , a feeling that has n't faded over time			0
' i always wanted to be understood			0
who does n't want to be liked , right ? ' @entity1 said , her voice trailing off as she concluded the interview			2

in 1994 , @entity1 was clubbed in the knee at the @entity10 by @entity6 's ex-husband @entity11 and a hit squad to try to keep her from skating against @entity6 in the @entity14
two decades later , @entity1 who recovered and went on to win a silver medal at the games , has opened up about the scandal for the first time
at a friday press screening of a new documentary ' @entity1 & @entity6 , ' which will air on @entity37 on sunday , @entity1 grew noticeably uncomfortable
in the show , @entity6 says , dismissively : ' i 've apologized so many times . she is not worth my time anymore '
the bizarre attack stunned the @entity5 world and made headlines in the @entity96 and *abroad*
