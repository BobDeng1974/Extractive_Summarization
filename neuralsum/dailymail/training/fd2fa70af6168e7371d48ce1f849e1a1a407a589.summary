by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 21:38 est , 26 august 2013 yesterday was a picture - perfect @entity1 in the @entity3 village of @entity4			1
hundreds of day - trippers took advantage of the summer sunshine to wander along grassy meadows next to a meandering @entity9			1
on the @entity16 , just a brisk walk from the historic house where local author @entity12 wrote @entity13 , a steady trickle of customers came seeking refreshment at @entity18 and @entity20 ’s newly opened tea shop , the @entity19			1
as they poured @entity22 into bone china cups , and carved into magnificent cakes , @entity25 and @entity27 ’s customers could reflect that they were enjoying a quintessentially @entity30 moment on what is rightly regarded as one of the country ’s most beautiful @entity33			2
victims : @entity20 and @entity18 opened the cafe only two weeks ago but had someone post 50 exotic cockroaches through their letterbox on thursday unspoiled @entity4 is , after all , famed for everything from its 11th - century church to the higgledy - piggledy houses that grace the oil paintings of famous landscape artist sir @entity44 , a local resident who used to call it his ‘ village in heaven ’			1
yet behind the comforting smell of brewing tea and freshly buttered scones , another , less savoury , aroma could be detected in the airy back room of the @entity19			1
it was the unsettling whiff of a bizarre and increasingly ugly scandal			2
@entity57 began on thursday morning , when the owners arrived to discover that no fewer than 50 cockroaches had been posted through their letterbox during the night			1
the large red insects were crawling around on the floor , making a vigorous hissing sound that one eye - witness has compared to ‘ something out of a low - budget horror movie ’			2
creepy crawlies : @entity68 and @entity25 went to open @entity69 on @entity70 on thursday morning to find the floor covered in insects the bugs were later collected by police and taken away for tests which have established that they were @entity76 , an exotic species which can grow up to three inches long			2
health officials closed the tea shop for the day , and baffled detectives are now attempting to establish who might be responsible for attempting to sabotage the @entity19			1
the incident has stunned well - heeled villagers , and left @entity25 and @entity68 , in their words , ‘ worried and thoroughly disgusted ’			2
‘ it was a terrible , revolting thing to do , and people here just ca n’t believe someone could do it , ’ said @entity68 , 38 , when we met			2
‘ we ca n’t blame anyone , or point the finger			2
we just do n’t know who might be responsible			2
but obviously we want to find out			2
this was n’t just some kids messing around			2
it was a planned attack , by someone who wanted to cause harm			2
’ the crime has appalled and enthralled the village in equal measure			0
a string of conspiracy theories are already swirling around @entity4 , which sits in @entity102 ’s commuter belt , has a thriving @entity103 and , according to the @entity104 , is the second most wealthy village in the country			1
‘ it ’s @entity117 , with cockroaches in place of a corpse , ’ declared one drinker , darkly , at the village ’s @entity109 pub , a hostelry occasionally frequented by such celebrated locals as rugby coach sir @entity113 , singer @entity114 , @entity115 and tv presenter @entity116			1
saving grace : it was fortunate that the 50 roaches were @entity124 as they are easier to get rid of like many residents of this tight - knit community , my informant was reluctant to give his name in connection with the incident			1
but he was also happy to outline at some length several exotic theories regarding the @entity135 cockroaches , which are prized by pet owners for their habit of hissing noisily when disturbed			1
he , and several other interviewees , took the view that the bugs were planted by someone loyal to a rival business			0
they pointed out that the lucrative trade in providing tea and coffee to day - trippers in @entity4 has hitherto been dominated by three or four nearby village pubs , along with a single coffee shop , infusions , which is situated directly next door to the @entity19			1
but there is no evidence to support such claims			0
indeed , when i visited infusions , the manageress , who also declined to give her name , said she had ‘ no comment ’ to make about the cockroach incident , but added , pointedly , that she would ‘ never have anything to do ’ with any such attack			0
‘ i ca n’t stand cockroaches			1
they give me the heebie - jeebies , ’ she said			0
‘ i ca n’t go near them			0
i saw them at the zoo once , when i visited with my children , and was too scared to even go near their tank			0
i would certainly never touch them			0
’ a second popular theory regarding this unsolved ‘ whodunnit ’ revolves around the fact that @entity20 hails originally from @entity175			0
could racism be a motive ? i found nothing to support this theory , although @entity4 certainly has form when it comes to taking issue with exotic incomers			1
a few years ago , when it was reported that rock - star @entity185 had brought a house just outside the village , locals held a meeting at the @entity191 pub to raise fears about the former @entity194 singer and his urbanite friends lowering the tone of the community			0
criminal activity : police are investigating incident but have yet to find the culprit yesterday , locals were at pains to describe the village as a tolerant place which welcomes outsiders			0
and @entity18 said that she has experienced ‘ nothing but goodwill ’ since arriving in @entity4			1
‘ a lot of people have been coming in saying how awful the incident is , how sorry they are , and staying for a cup of tea , ’ she said			1
a third theory posits the idea that the attack was the work of a homophobe who might have leapt to the conclusion that @entity222 and @entity20 are domestic , as well as business , partners			0
this thesis , aired in online forums over the weekend , was presumably inspired by @entity4 ’s last brush with infamy , in 2010 , when a churchgoing local couple , who run a @entity231 , were prosecuted for refusing to allow two gay men to stay at their residence			1
yet it must be discounted because both women are in happy , heterosexual relationships			0
@entity25 has a husband and a young daughter , while @entity68 lives with her fiancé in @entity240 , @entity241			0
‘ that theory is very funny , but we ’re business partners and nothing else , ’ @entity68 said			0
‘ not that it matters in this day and age , of course			0
’ the police investigation continues but , as yet , has made little progress			0
i understand that no fingerprints were found on the @entity19 ’s letterbox , and footage from @entity255 cameras at either end of the @entity16 shows no more than a blurry image of individuals walking past the tea shop after dark , which is when the attack happened			1
inquiries at local pet shops — including one in @entity263 , about four miles away — have drawn a blank , since none is believed to stock @entity265			0
the insects are , however , widely available over the internet , and police are working on the assumption that they were purchased online and shipped to the attacker via mail order			0
whoever the cockcroach culprit was , and however well their tracks were covered , he or she also appears to have made at least one big mistake			0
‘ the pest control guy who visited the shop after the attack said we ’d been very lucky that they had used this type of cockroach , because the insects all stayed in a relatively small area by the door , ’ says @entity68			1
‘ if they had been normal cockroaches it would have been different			1
within a short time they would have been all over the shop and we would probably have been closed for days			1
’ did the mysterious attacker make other crucial errors that will eventually see them unmasked ? as with any high - profile , unsolved crime , only time will tell			0
in the meantime , sinister conspiracy theories will continue to flourish in this outwardly idyllic corner of rural @entity30 .			0
