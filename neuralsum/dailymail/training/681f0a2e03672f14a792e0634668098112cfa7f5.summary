they also discovered that the @entity20 - based food giant makes the same product for consumers in @entity23 but because of stricter regulations regarding additives , it is dye - free			2
in a video posted on the site they say that the yellow dyes , which contain benzidine 4 - amino - buphenyl , a man - made product derived from petroleum , are used ' solely for aesthetics '			2
the go on to highlight that the colorants have been linked to hyperactivity in children , asthma , migraines and cancer			1
mrs @entity9 , whose children are aged five and eight , said : ' we think this is an important issue to tackle because @entity52 is an iconic food product			1
' everyone â€™s had it at one time or another			0
i used to eat it ... i used to feed it to my kids years ago and we think we deserve the same version that our friends overseas in the @entity23 get without artificial food dye			0
' spreading the word : @entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity12 , have launched a campaign asking @entity4 to remove the artificial food dyes in its @entity7 version of @entity8 ms @entity10 points out that the dyes require warning labels in other countries outside of the @entity7 and have been in some @entity72 countries			1
in the @entity23 @entity4 does not use the additives in its version of @entity8 , called @entity52			2
instead natural beta carotene and paprika are added to achieve a yellow color			0
in their home - made video the two women taste - test both the @entity7 and @entity23 version of @entity4 's @entity8			1
they conclude that the two taste ' virtually the same ' and ' barely ' look different			0
in response to the mothers ' petition @entity4 said it produces at least 14 other @entity8 - inspired products , such as sauces and toppings , which only contain natural food colors			1
the @entity23 version of @entity4 '' s @entity8 - called @entity52 - ( left ) while the @entity7 offering contains two additives which have been linked to hyperactivity in children , allergies and cancer ( right ) spot the difference : after taste - testing both versions of @entity4 's @entity8 the two women concluded that they tasted ' virtually the same ' and ' barely ' looked different a company spokesperson , @entity99 , told @entity100 : ' the safety and quality of our products is our highest priority and we take consumer concerns very seriously			1
' we carefully follow the laws and regulations in the countries where our products are sold			0
so in the @entity7 , we only use colors that are approved and deemed safe for food use by the @entity112			2
' in the @entity7 seven artificial colorings are permitted by the @entity112 , which is responsible for food safety , these include blue 1 , blue 2 , green 3 , red 40 , red 3 , yellow 5 and yellow 6			1
' i used to eat it , i used to feed it to my kids and we think we deserve the same version that our friends overseas in the @entity23 ' ' all additives are subject to ongoing safety review as scientific understanding and methods of testing continue to improve			0
' consumers should feel safe about the foods they eat , ' the @entity112 states on its website			0
ms @entity10 and mrs @entity9 say that they want @entity7 regulations on food additives to fall in line with the @entity23			1
' it was shocking to see hundreds of ingredients that were banned in other countries and were used in @entity7 products , ' ms @entity10 said			2
' a can of @entity144 in the @entity7 looks the same as in the @entity23 or @entity72 and the ingredients are totally different			0
' for example , @entity148 fries at @entity149 in the @entity23 contained only potatoes , oil and salt , but in the @entity7 a preservative was added			0
food giant : @entity20 - based @entity4 was founded in 1903 the women cite a report from the @entity158 , titled @entity159 : a @entity160 , which outlines various studies on the health effects of food coloring			2
the group concluded that the three most widely used dyes - red 40 , yellow 5 , and yellow 6 - are contaminated with cancer - causing substances , while red 3 has been identified as a carcinogen by the @entity112 but is still in commercial use			1
@entity171 , who co-authored the study , said : ' these synthetic chemicals do absolutely nothing to improve the nutritional quality or safety of foods			0
' the @entity112 should ban dyes , which would force industry to color foods with real food ingredients , not toxic petrochemicals			0
' mrs @entity9 said she no longer lets her children eat @entity8 , but if the @entity23 version of the product were available in the @entity7 , she would put it back on the menu			1
