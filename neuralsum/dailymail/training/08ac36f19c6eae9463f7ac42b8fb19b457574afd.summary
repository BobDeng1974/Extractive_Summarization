by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 15 october 2012 a judge has rejected requests to delay the trial of five @entity5 prisoners accused of plotting the september 11 attacks because of a rat and mould infestation in their defence lawyers ' offices			1
@entity11 attempts to move forward the military tribunal proceedings have been thwarted for months by scheduling conflicts , religious observances , an internet outage and a tropical storm			1
and the latest request to postpone proceedings relate to offices assigned to the defendants ' lawyers at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
they claim conditions in the 1940s buildings are making them sick			1
after an aborted attempt to try them at @entity5 in 2008 , the five were arraigned on revised charges during a chaotic 13 - hour hearing in may that was marked by defiant outbursts from the defendants			2
there have been no hearings in the case since then			0
a hearing tentatively set for june was delayed because one of @entity30 's defence lawyers , a civilian death penalty expert , had to attend the execution of a client in an unrelated case			2
a july session was postponed to allow the defendants to observe the holy month of @entity66 , when @entity67 fast during daylight hours			0
hearings set for august were delayed when an @entity71 outage left the lawyers unable to access their electronic legal documents , and then cancelled altogether as @entity74 approached			2
it doused the base but caused no damage			2

@entity95 , a civilian lawyer for defendant @entity80 , said : ' my eyes burn			0
@entity99 suffer some sort of symptoms			0
' they asked for a delay , saying that without their work area they did not have resources to prepare for the hearings			0
however the judge , army colonel @entity108 , ordered a clean - up but ruled on october 5 that there would be no further postponement			1
the building has since been certified as safe by the base hospital 's @entity113 , though some of the lawyers said it was still toxic and are working from a cramped high - security trailer inside the court complex rather than return to that building			1
many buildings at the humid and tropical base are kept uncomfortably cold to keep the mould and vermin at bay			0
defence lawyers want the judge to abolish a process treating as a top national secret any discussion of what happened to the defendants before being sent to @entity5 in 2006 ( pictured ) the chief prosecutor , @entity135 brigadier general @entity134 , acknowledged to journalists on sunday evening that the tribunals were taking place in a ' relatively austere setting ' , but added : ' justice is not determined by the plushness of the surroundings			1
' many of the issues the court will address during this week 's hearing pertain to secrecy issues			0
defence lawyers want the judge to abolish a ' presumptive classification ' process that treats as a top national secret any discussion of what happened to the defendants during interrogations in secret @entity158 prisons before being sent to @entity5 in 2006			2
the judge will also hear news organisations ' request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions , and be asked to decide whether the @entity11 @entity164 governs the tribunals being held at the @entity11 base in south east @entity23			1
in addition to @entity30 and @entity80 , defendants @entity29 , @entity85 and @entity84 , are charged with conspiring with @entity44 , attacking civilians and civilian targets , murder in violation of the laws of war , destruction of property , hijacking and terrorism			0
