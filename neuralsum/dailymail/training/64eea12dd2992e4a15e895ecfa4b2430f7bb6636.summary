i tell you everything , i confide in you , i seek your advice , i love you , care about you , worry about you			2
' it is claimed the pair , who are on trial for phone hacking together , dated in secret between 1998 and 2004			1
mr @entity42 repeated those passages again in open court today after revealing that the document had been recovered from one of @entity1 ' computers			1

' the fact is you are my very best friend			0
i tell you everything , i confide in you , i seek your advice , i love you , care about you , worry about you			0
' we laugh and cry together			0
in fact without our relationship in my life , i am really not sure how i will cope			0
@entity1 , seated next to husband @entity26 , stared ahead intently as the document , in which she wrote : ' you are my very best friend ' , was read ' i 'm frightened to be without you , but bearing in mind " the rules " you will not know how i am doing and vice versa			1
' the thought of finding out anything about you or your life from someone else fills me with absolute dread			0
' also you said i had to email you if anything important happened , like if i was ill ? ' i do n't understand this , we are either there for each other or not surely ? ' anyway , that really is n't where i am confused			0
i know what horror it means and i know why we have to stick to it			0
' but for example , how does this work thing manifest itself			0
@entity9 ' phone was hacked 43 times by @entity90 investigator @entity89 in 2006 , the court heard			1
the convicted phone hacker was also listening to @entity2 's voicemails at the same time , even hacking him six times on a single day			1
@entity1 ' maiden name , @entity9 , appeared several times in @entity89 's notes recovered by police			1
on one page , he had an account number alongside her name , a list of mobile phone service providers , and the word ' @entity105 '			2
another page with @entity1 ' name had her mobile number and the names of ex-husband @entity111 and former news international lawyer @entity112			1
@entity89 had made notes on @entity2 but misspelt his name as ' @entity117 ' , the court heard			1
phone records show that @entity1 was hacked 13 times in march 2006 , 15 times in april , another ten times in may , and five times in june and july			1
@entity2 was targeted six times on february 1 , 2006 , and another five times later in the month			2

mr @entity42 showed this data in agreed admission presented to the jury at the close of the prosecution case			0
' do we limit contact until we absolutely have to , like leaving our execs to sort run - of - the - mill joint stuff ? i do n't want to get this wrong			0
' i hope that i 've managed to put your mind at rest about @entity143 , and that you two now have a better relationship			0
' on @entity147 [ @entity147 ] , well he 's not b * llocking you must not brood on lack of calls			0
' obviously i ca n't discuss my worries , concerns , problems at work with you anymore , and vice versa , but i 'll assume unless i hear different that we keep our professional relationship to the minimum , and avoid if possible without it being in any way awkward			0
' if it is necessary or more importantly right that we two editors should deal with it , then we will			0
if either of us feels that we are not striking this balance then we must say			0
' the letter was presented to the jury as the prosecution case draws to a close			0
this is the third time in the trial the unusual step of asking jurors to read evidence in silence has been taken			1
it was first used over privacy concerns with voicemails left by former home secretary @entity180 , and again for two email exchanges involving journalists at the @entity183 the court also heard how @entity1 emailed ex-husband @entity111 saying they needed to ‘ talk about phone hacking ’ three weeks before her arrest			1
the email to the former @entity190 actor was recovered from @entity1 ’ @entity192 mobile phone , having been sent at 11.03pm on june 23 , 2011			2
‘ hello , how are you ? ’ , she wrote			0
‘ need to talk to you about phone hacking at some point			1
when are you free ? ’ prosecutor @entity29 then told jurors that less than half an hour later , @entity1 emailed her personal assistants @entity200 and @entity201 saying : ‘ need my 2002/03 diaries			1
’ the emails were taken off the @entity192 seized from @entity1 when she was first arrested on july 17 , 2011			2
another email is to @entity206 on july 8 , 2011 , saying : ‘ coffee and hot milk please , separately			0
’ jurors at the @entity20 were today handed the two - and - a - half page document from @entity1 to @entity2 - but were forced to in silence the first part of the letter , which will not now be heard in open court mr @entity42 said : ‘ this is the day of the withdrawal of the notebooks from the archive ’ , referring to the charge that @entity1 and @entity206 face together			1
the jury heard many of @entity1 ’ emails have been lost forever because she did not agree for them to be kept in an archive			2
the former @entity225 chief executive decided not to ‘ opt in ’ to an automatic archive system when it was installed in 2005			0
as a result , very few of her emails over six years at @entity225 including four years as editor of @entity183 have been recovered by police			0
prosecutor @entity232 told the court : ‘ mrs @entity9 never opted in to using @entity225 ’s original archive system when it was installed in january 2005			1
‘ this meant emails on @entity1 ’ email account were not retained on the archiving system			2
‘ emails sent to her and received from her by other employees would be retained on the system in those users ’ own archiving system , unless deleted by that user within 14 days			0
’ he added the ‘ percentage of her account recovered can not be confirmed			0
’ the court heard police investigating phone hacking at the @entity90 and corruption at @entity183 have recovered four batches of emails from the @entity225 system			1
one was the ‘ live email archive ’ from 2000 to 2007 , there are two systems that have been rebuilt , and a back - up system			0
the court heard that nearly 4.5m emails from 2005 to 2010 were purged by @entity225 as part of a routine clean - out in september 2010 , but 1.49m had subsequently been recovered from other sources			1
jurors also heard that @entity1 ’ old hard drive from her office in @entity270 was removed prior to the computer being disposed of			1
the removal happened after the @entity225 executive moved to new offices in @entity275 in january 2011 , and were issued with new computers			0
however , on an audit in may 2011 , it was discovered there was no hard drive in @entity1 ’ now redundant computer			2
the computer was then thrown away because @entity1 ’ name was not on a list of phone hacking suspects whose computer equipment was being preserved			1
after today , the trial will take a break for several days of legal discussions before resuming on monday , february 17 when the defence cases are due to begin			0
