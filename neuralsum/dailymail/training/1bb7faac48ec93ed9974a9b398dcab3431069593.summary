tragic : @entity0 was described as the ' ultimate warrior ' by military colleagues a @entity4 helicopter gunship killed a @entity6 soldier in @entity7 after being ordered to attack by officers who had misinterpreted grainy images from a drone aircraft			1
yesterday , coroner @entity12 condemned ‘ mistakes and failures ’ by ‘ unprofessional ’ commanders that led to the friendly fire strike on the @entity6 patrol ’s base – and questioned why officers had not understood the information and aborted the attack			1
troops from the @entity23 were in a firefight with insurgents in @entity26 in december 2009			1
unknown to them , senior @entity6 officers were watching the drone ’s grainy images from the safety of @entity31 , about 30 miles from the battle at @entity33			2
the officers , however , had mistaken the soldiers ’ mud - walled compound for the enemy ’s lair			2
lance corporal @entity0 , 23 , a married father of one , suffered fatal head injuries when the @entity4 @entity40 gunship swooped in and opened fire with its 30mm chain guns , firing about 200 rounds of ammunition			2
the soldier , from @entity46 , was flown to @entity31 but died the next day			1
eleven of his comrades were also wounded			2
after a five - day hearing in the soldier ’s home town , the coroner condemned a string of errors that led to the death of @entity57			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ the deployment and use by friendly forces of attack helicopters was done in circumstances that ought to have been assessed by them to conclude sooner than they did that their target was not an enemy force and that the attack should be aborted			0
’ he also blamed the fact that @entity70 was not marked on military maps and that @entity6 commanders insisted there were no friendly forces in the vicinity			0
criticism : @entity0 's widow @entity77 ( left ) watches as his surviving brother staff sgt @entity78 address the waiting media outside the coroner 's court case to answer : @entity84 's widow @entity77 and brother @entity78 said the @entity85 should be ' held accountable for their actions ' he concluded : ‘ lance corporal @entity0 died as a consequence of assumptions made , mistaken beliefs and cumulative failures by friendly forces			1
‘ they had misinterpreted the imagery , and rather than observing what they interpreted as an insurgent location they were in fact viewing @entity70 , and used this information to guide the helicopter crews			0
‘ misplaced assumptions and beliefs became fact , and opportunities to reflect and change a course of events were not taken			0
’ drone aircraft are unmanned reconnaissance planes that remain in the air for many hours relaying images to frontline commanders			0
they are piloted by remote control using video screens , sometimes from as far away as a @entity4 military base in @entity115			0
mr @entity12 said the conduct of soldiers at @entity33 had been ‘ extremely courageous and exemplary ’			0
he added : ‘ they were professional and remained true to their training and procedures , factors that undoubtedly saved the loss of further lives in the face of adversity			0
lance corporal @entity0 , 23 , left behind his baby son @entity78 when he was shot by a @entity4 helicopter devastated : @entity129 arrives at the inquest in @entity46 earlier this week into the death of her husband @entity132 @entity0 ‘ unfortunately , the same could not be said of some others who were not at @entity33 when they came under pressure			0
’ in a statement to the inquest , @entity57 ’s family accused the @entity138 and @entity85 of negligence and trying to cover up the severity of the incident			1
it said : ‘ the “ fog of war ” were the words used by the @entity85 , instead of saying what should have been said : negligence , plain and simple			1
sargeant major @entity147 arrives to give evidence to the inquest in @entity46 earlier this week @entity147 was the man in charge in the @entity6 control room when the helicopter fired on friendly soldiers sargeant major @entity154 was overruled by an officer when he raised his concerns that @entity6 troops were being attacked lance corporal @entity158 was on the roof of the compound firing a machinegun at the enemy when he realised the friendly apache was firing at him corporal @entity164 describes himself as @entity166 's ' best mate ' major @entity167 also gave evidence at the inquest earlier this week ‘ this has upset the family considerably and has given the impression that @entity0 and his injured comrades meant very little to the @entity85 ’ an @entity85 spokesman said : ‘ this tragic incident occurred in a highly challenging and fast - moving environment			1
all of those involved acted with the best intentions to assist their comrades , but tragically mistakes were made			2
‘ @entity183 investigations have been conducted and key lessons identified			0
