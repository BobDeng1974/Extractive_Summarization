by @entity1 reporter published : 08:36 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 21 february 2013 @entity3 soldiers chased @entity5 journalists who attempted to shed light on a secretive military unit believed to be behind hacking attacks on the @entity5 government			1
the journalists were driving away from soldiers of the @entity12 , when the men started chasing the car while journalists were filming			1
video footage from a moving vehicle appears to show the soldiers break into a run , and keep pace with the car , while panicked journalists urge their driver : ' keep driving			2
keep driving , drive away			0
drive away , drive away ! ' : the panicked instructions of journalists to their driver as they are chased the clip has been released following revelations from @entity5 security firm @entity36 that the @entity12 's @entity31 - based @entity37 is the most likely driving force behind hundreds , if not thousands of cyber attacks			1
it said a @entity31 office block is linked to stolen technology blueprints , manufacturing processes , clinical trial results , pricing documents , negotiation strategies and other secret data from the @entity5 government and more than 100 aerospace , communications and energy companies			1
more alarmingly , it claims the unit , known as the @entity37 , has also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines , power grids , water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure			1
hot pursuit : the @entity5 journalists were spotted by soldiers from the @entity12 in @entity31 @entity3 soldiers chased the @entity5 journalists away from the scene on the streets of @entity31 ' the nature of @entity37 's work is considered by @entity3 to be a state secret , ' @entity36 said in a report released in the @entity5			1
' however , we believe it engages in harmful " @entity74 "			0
' it is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in @entity3 and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively , ' it said			0
the @entity81 today dismissed the report as ' groundless ' and said the government firmly opposed hacking			1
' source of attacks ' : unit 61398 is located in @entity31 's @entity90 district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in @entity92 as well as computer programming and network operations , the report said ground zero : the building , used by the @entity12 , is located on the outskirts of @entity31 ' @entity99 attacks are transnational and anonymous			1
determining their origins are extremely difficult			0
we do n't know how the evidence in this so - called report can be tenable , ' spokesman @entity102 told a daily news briefing			0
' @entity108 criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible , unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue			0
' @entity102 cited a @entity3 study which pointed to the @entity5 as being behind hacking in @entity3			2
' of the above mentioned @entity113 hacking attacks , attacks originating from the @entity5 rank first			2
' @entity3 's @entity115 did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the report			2
prolific : the unit , known as @entity37 , is alleged to have stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 denial : the @entity81 today dismissed the report as ' groundless ' and said the government firmly opposed hacking unit 61398 is located in @entity31 's @entity90 district , @entity3 's financial and banking hub and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in @entity92 as well as computer programming and network operations , @entity36 said in its report			1
the unit had stolen ' hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 ' , it said			1
some 115 of the victims were located in the @entity5 , with smaller numbers in @entity141 and @entity142			2
the information stolen ranged from details on mergers and acquisitions to the emails of senior employees , the company said			0
guarded : the company traced @entity37 's presence on the @entity113 , including numeric web addresses within a block assigned to the @entity12 unit such is the fear of @entity3 's cyber weaponry , @entity5 companies have been warned not to do business with two of its leading technology firms because they pose a national security threat			1
the @entity163 said in a report in october that @entity5 regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the country by @entity168 and @entity169 , which are among the world 's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones			1
two weeks earlier , the @entity174 revealed that cyber attackers linked to the @entity3 government attempted to hack into a computer system in the @entity178			0
while the official statement down played the attack , one report claimed that the hackers targeted the hardware which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes			2
the state - run @entity187 system in @entity189 was also hacked last year , prompting calls for tightened security around any government health databases that would be implemented in accordance with the @entity194			0
while attacks on state infrastructure poses the greatest risk , the effect cyber warfare in the private sector can also be catastrophic			0
in november 2011 , the @entity200 released a report detailing the extent of damage done by @entity3 and @entity205 hackers on various companies			0
one example was that of a paint company called @entity209 , which had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen			0
the move cost the company $ 20million			0
@entity214 , a @entity215 electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in @entity5 including iphones , was hacked in february by a group called @entity219 which then obtained and released the email and credit card data for banking information for @entity5 companies including @entity224 and @entity225			1
some experts said they doubted @entity3 government denials			0
' the @entity12 plays a key role in @entity3 's multi-faceted security strategy , so it makes sense that its resources would be used to facilitate economic cyber espionage that helps the @entity3 economy , ' said @entity234 , chief technology officer and co-founder of @entity236 , one of @entity36 's competitors			1
though privately held and little known to the general public , @entity36 is one of a handful of @entity5 cyber-security companies that specialise in attempting to detect , prevent and trace the most advanced hacking attacks , instead of the garden - variety viruses and criminal intrusions that befoul corporate networks on a daily basis			1
but @entity36 does not promote its analysis in public and only rarely issues topical papers about changes in techniques or behaviours			0
it has never before given the apparent proper names of suspected hackers or directly tied them to a military branch of the @entity3 government , giving the new report special resonance			0
the company published details of the attack programmes and dummy websites used to infiltrate @entity5 companies , typically via deceptive emails			2
@entity5 officials have complained in the past to @entity3 about sanctioned trade - secret theft , but have had a limited public record to point to			0
@entity36 said it knew the @entity12 would shift tactics and programmes in response to its report , but concluded that the disclosure was worth it because of the scale of the harm and the ability of @entity3 to issue denials in the past and duck accountability			1
the company traced @entity37 's presence on the @entity113 - including registration data for a question - and - answer session with a @entity3 professor and numeric internet addresses within a block assigned to the @entity12 unit - and concluded that it was a major contributor to operations against the @entity5 companies			1
members of @entity294 and intelligence authorities in the @entity5 have publicised the same general conclusions : that economic espionage is an official mission of the @entity12 and other elements of the @entity3 government , and that hacking is a primary method			2
in november 2011 , the @entity5 @entity302 publicly decried @entity3 in particular as the biggest known thief of @entity5 trade secrets			0
the @entity36 report comes a week after @entity5 president @entity306 issued a long - awaited executive order aimed at getting the private owners of power plants and other critical infrastructure to share data on attacks with officials and to begin to follow consensus best practices on security			1
both @entity5 @entity317 and @entity318 have said more powerful legislation is needed , citing @entity3 penetration not just of the largest companies but of operations essential to a functioning country , including those comprising the electric grid .			2
