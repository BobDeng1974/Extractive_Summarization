by @entity0 in the wake of the embarrassing ' bridgegate ' scandal , a new poll has revealed that @entity4 now have a largely unfavorable opinion of the @entity7 governor and presidential hopeful @entity8			1
however , among his core @entity11 supporters , @entity8 's approval ratings are almost unchanged from before the september 2013 closure of the @entity14 as revenge against the mayor of @entity17 , @entity7 by @entity8 staff			1
the survey found that 51 per cent of @entity11 say they have a favorable opinion of @entity8 while 33 per cent have an unfavorable opinion			1
taking a dive : @entity7 governor @entity8 ( seen here in march ) has lost favor with @entity25 and @entity26 but his fellow @entity11 have n't wavered overall , 45 per cent of @entity4 have an unfavorable opinion of @entity8 , and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion			1
these figures show a dramatic drop since january , when another @entity33 / @entity32 poll found that just 34 per cent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of the @entity7 governor , and 38 per cent had a positive view of him			1
increasingly , @entity4 are mistrustful of @entity8 , with 36 per cent saying they believe he is lying when he says he did n't know anything about his staff 's involvement in causing the bridge bottleneck - though 48 per cent of @entity11 believe he is telling the truth , as opposed to 19 per cent who believe he 's lying			2
the drop in approval is almost entirely among @entity26 and @entity25 , who largely believe @entity8 lied about his involvement in bridgegate and that he is an unfavorable candidate			2
as for @entity8 's presidential hopes , 10 per cent of @entity11 ' definitely ' plan to support his nomination , while 32 per cent would consider it			2
massive holdups : two of three lanes on the @entity14 were closed between september 9 - 13 at the behest of @entity8 staffers without warning to the public or emergency services @entity8 has maintained throughout the scandal that he was ignorant of any revenge plot hatched by his staff			0
a law firm handpicked by @entity8 himself somewhat unsurprisingly found that he was not involved in the bridge closure scheme			0
the tax - payer funded , self - commissioned report came out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers			0
a @entity81 / @entity80 poll conducted in october - before the scandal erupted - showed that just 17 per cent of @entity4 viewed @entity8 negatively , a dramatic difference from today 's results			0
the september 9 lane closure on the @entity14 caused a threat to public safety , not to mention inconvenience to residents			0
local area officials and emergency services officers , as well as the general public , were not notified of the lane closures , and there were multiple cases in which emergency services responses were delayed .			0

a @entity33 / @entity32 poll shows that @entity8 's approval ratings have fallen among @entity4 since ' bridgegate '
45 per cent of @entity4 have an unfavorable opinion of @entity8 , and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion
the dive in approval is almost entirely among @entity25 and @entity26
among @entity11 , his ratings *remain* almost exactly the same as they were *pre-scandal*
51 per cent of @entity11 have a favorable opinion of the governor ,
ten per cent would support his nomination in the 2016 *elections* , while 32 per cent would consider it
