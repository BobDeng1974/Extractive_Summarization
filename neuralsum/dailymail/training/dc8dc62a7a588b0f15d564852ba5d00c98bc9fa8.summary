it is a meeting which aims to promote everything good about racing in this country with over £ 4million of prizemoney			0
but if you are betting , it has not always paid to be patriotic at @entity5 at @entity6			1
the first three years of the end - of - season finale featuring five group races , has seen over half won by runners from either @entity10 or @entity11 and there is no sign of the foreign invasion relenting			1
@entity15 is tipped to repeat 2011 success in the @entity17 at @entity6 @entity10 warrior @entity15 , the 2011 winner , is favourite win a second @entity17 when his main rival could turn out be @entity22			1
an equally potent challenger from across the @entity24 is @entity25 , who can continue the wonderful month for the @entity28 family in the @entity29			0
two weeks after @entity31 secured a second @entity32 with @entity33 , brother @entity30 saddles the winner of the @entity35 and @entity36 insisting his colt is a different proposition to when he was fifth to @entity40 ’s @entity39 in the @entity41 at @entity42 in may			1
the pair clash again and @entity28 said : ‘ i am very happy with him			0
the ground will be very testing and it will make it a tough mile but he will cope — he has won on the soft			0
he is more mature and relaxes which he never did in the @entity41			0
’ @entity25 can continue wonderful month for the @entity28 family in the @entity48 seventeen @entity50 winners are due to line up , a decent number to soften the blow of high - profile absentees headed by @entity54 and @entity55			2
by the end of the day , we should know whether @entity40 , in his first season since taking over from his father , will be champion trainer after his tussle with @entity62			1
@entity40 leads by £ 215,000 and could be made to sweat as his rival attacks the @entity64 ( flying officer and @entity66 ) and @entity67 ( @entity68 ) before his first runners — night of @entity70 and @entity71 in the @entity48 — enter the fray			2
@entity62 also runs @entity73 in the @entity17 , where @entity40 saddles @entity74 , worth £ 770,000 to the winner			1
@entity39 ( above left ) and @entity25 will clash again in the @entity48 but the odds are in @entity40 ’s favour and , if results go his way , he could become the first @entity82 trainer to break the £ 5m barrier for the season			1
he will hope for better than yesterday at @entity42 ’s @entity85 when his favourites @entity86 ( second in the @entity87 ) and @entity88 ( fourth in the @entity89 ) were beaten			0
@entity40 said : ‘ we still have air in our lungs and tomorrow might be different			2
’ it was @entity95 - ridden @entity94 , a third @entity50 winner of the season for @entity98 , who emerged on top in the @entity89 and @entity100 ( @entity101 ) for @entity102 , who landed the @entity87			0
the latter , now 16 - 1 for the @entity41 , was a first @entity103 in the blue colours of sheik @entity106 ’s @entity105 since @entity108 ’s @entity107 won the @entity17 on today ’s card a year ago .			0

@entity5 features five group races at @entity6
over half of winners in past three years have been from @entity10 or @entity11
@entity40 *battling* with @entity62 to be champion trainer
