@entity1 manager @entity0 called for the introduction of video technology after his side fell victim to two terrible penalty decisions in thursday 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity8			1
@entity1 were particularly incensed by referee @entity10 ’ decision to award a 17th minute spot kick for handball when the ball clearly hit @entity14 in the face			1
that provoked @entity21 ’s @entity20 , himself an @entity17 player , to tweet : ‘ worst penalty decision ever as @entity10 gives handball against @entity1 ’s @entity14 at @entity24 when it hit him in the face			1
wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on @entity21			2
i reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night			2
’ @entity8 were the beneficiaries of a decision that @entity20 described as the ' worst penalty decision ever ' the ball hits @entity14 ( right ) in the face but @entity10 gave @entity8 a penalty @entity1 players surround the official after @entity8 were given a penalty in the first half @entity0 added : ‘ it ’s unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that , the game could be a lot easier if we used what is available to us			1
this is the problem the game has because we expose human beings to making errors			2
the officials are there to do a job and we could make it much easier if technology was utilised			0
’ ‘ we ’ve got it [ as a coaching staff ]			0
it takes a couple of seconds			0
that could have been reviewed instantaneously			0
‘ in @entity59 games , we have seen the introduction of further assistants in the penalty area			1
it ’s a question for the governing bodies of the games			0
do i think it should be there ? yes			0
’ @entity1 were 2 - 0 down at half - time after @entity69 converted the two spot - kicks but recovered in remarkable fashion , as long - distance strikes from @entity73 and @entity74 salvaged a draw			1
referee @entity10 awarded the controversial penalty hapless referee @entity10 started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding @entity8 a penalty when the ball appeared to hit @entity1 's @entity14 on the head as he slid to block @entity82 's cross			1
@entity10 clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of @entity14 but replays showed that was not the case			1
referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened			0
@entity69 stepped up and scored the penalty against @entity1 that should never have been @entity20 was incredulous after the award of @entity8 's first penalty @entity20 vented his frustration after @entity10 awarded another penalty for @entity8 , which @entity69 scored @entity20 joked ' some of them ( referees ) may have been celebrating too hard last night ' @entity8 boss @entity100 , who admitted the ball struck @entity14 ’s head , hit out at his team ’s complacency as they missed a golden opportunity to close down the gap between themselves and the @entity109 places			1
they are remain 8th and seven points behind @entity112 ‘ i thought we got what we deserved in the end , ’ @entity100 said , ‘ i do n’t think we played well and @entity1 played very well			0
we gave away poor goals , giving the ball away very cheaply			1
we did n’t play well enough to merit a win			0
‘ we had a plan in place for after we score or after the opponent scored and a clear idea of what to do but kept giving way simple possession			2
even things like ten yard passes , we would recover the ball and lose it again			2
the lead should be enough but we just made too many mistakes			0
