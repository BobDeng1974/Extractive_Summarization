by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 01:21 est , 8 july 2013 torment : @entity2 has revealed her decision to undergo a double mastectomy a newsreader from @entity6 who underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with cancer has revealed how she held a ' boobs party ' to say goodbye to her breasts before going under the knife			1
@entity2 , who suffered from cancer as a teenager , was shocked to learn the disease had returned when she developed a tumour in one of her breasts			1
but when she received her diagnosis , she resolved to take immediate action and decided to have both her breasts removed to minimise the risk of the cancer spreading			1
the 42 - year - old mother of one underwent her double mastectomy in april , and three months later has documented the harrowing experience in a diary published by the @entity26			1
soon after leaving school , ms @entity2 was diagnosed with @entity30 's lymphoma , and underwent a gruelling round of radiotherapy until she was given a clean bill of health			2
she went on to develop a successful career as a newsreader for @entity37 and then @entity6 , and had a son , @entity39 , with her husband @entity40			0
however , last year she was told that a lump on her left breast which has previously been benign had developed into a malignant tumour			2
poignantly , it seems that the cause of the cancer was the high dose of radiation she received during her lymphoma treatment two decades earlier			0
' i feel an overwhelming surge of panic , ' ms @entity2 wrote of the moment her breast cancer was diagnosed			2
' i ca n't get cancer again			0
i 'm a cancer survivor not a cancer victim			0
@entity56 , vomiting , exhaustion , baldness : that was another life			0
' because of her earlier radiotherapy , the newsreader had been exposed to the maximum dose of radiation considered safe over the course of a lifetime , meaning the only treatment option was the removal of the affected breast			0
doctors told her that she had a 25 per cent chance of developing cancer in the other breast too - and ms @entity2 immediately resolved to undergo a double mastectomy			1
' my right breast is perfectly healthy , but there 's no guarantee it will stay that way , ' she wrote			0
' to me it 's a ticking time bomb			0
i know immediately i want a double mastectomy			1
i feel in a state of perfect clarity			0
the only thing that 's important is to get this cancer out of me and do anything in my power to prevent it from coming back			0
' publicity : @entity87 has drawn attention to the plight of women undergoing mastectomies ms @entity2 was racked by fears of not being there to see three - year - old @entity39 grow up , and was acutely conscious that her own mother had died of cancer aged just 59			1
nonetheless , she was able to keep up a healthy demeanour , and even held a ' boobs party ' with 30 of her friends , who gathered three days before the surgery			1
she wrote : ' we toast my " departing assets " and the girls joke about how envious they will be of the new , tummy - tucked body i 'll be rocking after the operation			2
' the nine - hour operation at the @entity107 in @entity108 thankfully went without a hitch - despite her husband 's trepidation - but ms @entity2 was still tormented by her post-surgery appearance			1
she wrote about her ' disturbing ' torso , and her fears that @entity40 would find her unattractive , but when the bandages were taken off her chest she was pleasantly surprised by how she looked			0
ms @entity2 has now largely recovered from the procedure - she is able to play with her son and carry out household chores , and is planning to return to work soon			2
the dilemma faced by women who are highly susceptible to breast cancer was highlighted earlier this year by @entity124 star @entity87 , who revealed that she elected to have a double mastectomy after learning that she carried a faulty gene which often leads to the disease .			1

@entity2 suffered cancer as a teenager and disease returned in 2012
42 - year - old underwent double mastectomy to minimise risk of new tumour
before nine - hour operation she held a *celebratory* ' boobs party ' with friends
