two base jumpers who broke their backs and were told they may never walk again after they fell 500ft have started jumping again			1
@entity3 , 23 , and @entity4 , 25 , plummeted onto a riverbank when their parachutes tangled at the @entity8 , @entity9 , and were left badly injured			1
but a year later , after intensive recovery , both men have returned to the sport they love - and mr @entity3 has even retraced his steps to successfully jump from the bridge			1
@entity3 ( bottom ) and @entity4 ( right ) were left with broken vertebrae after a base jump off @entity19 in @entity9 went wrong and the fall almost killed them , one year on both have returned to the sport mr @entity3 was told he may never walk again after being injured , but he recovered to return to the jump this year the pair had been attempting a risky ' totem pole waterfall ' manoeuvre when @entity4 lost his balance and pulled out his friend 's parachute and landed inside of it			1
the jump on march 24 last year was being recorded by spectators and they watched as the pair spiraled to the beach below			1
stunned spectators - who recorded the near - fatal fall - could only gasp in horror as they spiralled onto the beach below			2
both suffered fractures to the spine - and mr @entity3 was told he might not walk again			1
last month - almost a year to the day - the 23 - year - old retraced his steps by successfully base jumping again from the @entity8			2
he said : ' it was such an amazing feeling to be back there after everything i had been through and all the work i have put into making my dream of jumping again a reality			0
mr @entity4 suffered fractures to his spine after he plummeted 500ft to a river bank when the fall went wrong ' because of what happened to @entity4 and me i 've accepted death as a possibility - but i ca n't dream of a life without doing what i love			1
' mr @entity3 , of @entity58 , @entity59 , has no memory of the fall but mr @entity4 remembers it clearly			1
he said : ' i remember standing on @entity63 's shoulders and getting ready while our friends held him there			0
' @entity63 gave the 3 - 2 - 1 countdown and i remember falling backwards and trying to jump onto the handrail , missing it , hitting the diving board and starting to flip			2
' i grabbed his pilot chute and tried to unwrap his bridle from around my leg			0
i then landed in his parachute , looked up and saw the sky above me and his canopy flapping around			0
as mr @entity3 jumped off the ledge of the bridge , mr @entity4 ( left , top ) got his foot stuck on the railings , the pair then began to tumble towards the river bank 500ft below ( right ) without their parachutes opening properly as they fell mr @entity4 got stuck in mr @entity3 's parachute ( left ) and the pair got closer to the ground ( right ) by standers saw mr @entity4 trying to untangle himself from the parachute ( left ) and mr @entity3 a crumpled heap ( right ) after the pair spiraled at speed towards the ground below the base jumping site ' the sound was significantly different from any other base jump and i remember thinking how i needed to get out of that position			1
' i kicked my feet over my head , fell out , and remember spinning at the ground as it got closer and knowing that we were gon na hit			0
' next thing i remember is waking up and sitting upright to catch the breath that had been knocked out of me			0
there were people all around , calling the emergency services , making sure we were staying still			0
' the pair were taken to hospital and had to undergo emergency 10 - hour surgeries			0
mr @entity4 added : ' seeing it on film the first few times made my stomach drop out like i was riding a roller - coaster			2
' mr @entity3 was recovering in hospital weeks after the fall and said moving his legs caused him immense pain both men had to undergo emergency 10 - hour surgery for injuries to their backs , mr @entity4 's is shown he suffered fractures and damage to his vertebrae and a sprained right ankle in which the ligament was completely ' torn off the bone '			1
mr @entity3 's injuries were more serious			1
he fractured his vertebrae , and suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury			2
some of his vertebrae was almost split in half by the impact			0
the pair had done almost 500 base - jumps between them when they were injured			2
mr @entity3 had to have a thumbnail - sized piece of bone removed from his spinal cord and mr @entity4 had some of his vertebrae fused with titanium			1
while mr @entity4 , from @entity146 , battled back onto his feet within a few weeks mr @entity3 faced the prospect of never walking again			1
after months of rehabilitation mr @entity3 started to improve and became determined to get walking again the base jumper was left in a wheelchair and began undergoing painful therapy to learn to walk again after seven months in a wheelchair mr @entity3 was able to walk again , having trained in his high school pool he spent three months in a back brace and seven months in a wheelchair , taking every opportunity to workout in his high - school swimming pool to strengthen his body			1
he said : ' the recovery process was insane			0
at first i could barely get out of bed because of the pain			0
the whole time i would feel severe nerve pain that would make me scream in agony for hours			0
it felt as though someone was holding a taser to my legs			0
' he was treated at the @entity172 , @entity9 and mr @entity4 at @entity174 's @entity173 , @entity175 and @entity176 , @entity146			2
almost a year to the day of the near fatal jump mr @entity63 returned to the bridge to do it again successfully the 23 - year - old avid base jumper says he wants to continue the sport and may next try wing suit base jumping this time there were no problems and the 23 - year - old sailed to the ground , determined to continue the sport both have now made unexpected recoveries and returned to base jumping , despite being involved in the near - fatal accident			1
mr @entity3 , a fitness coach , said his mother raised concerns about him returning to the sport			1
he said : ' she is the strongest , most giving person i will ever meet			0
if something happened to me again i ca n't imagine what she would go through			0
but she knows how much this means to me and how much joy it gives me			0
' mr @entity3 said he plans next to try wing suit base jumping			2
mr @entity4 made a remarkable recovery from the fall and around six months later was back base jumping the 25 - year - old began base jumping last october and went to @entity206 in @entity207 to base jump in october 2014 mr @entity4 returned to the sport at @entity206 , @entity207 , and said he has no plans to put down his parachute			1
