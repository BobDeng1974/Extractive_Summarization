@entity0 scored his first free - kick in 57 attempts to send @entity3 on their way to a 3 - 0 victory over @entity6			1
it was his 38th league goal of the season and with @entity11 loanee @entity10 scoring a second this was another win that @entity3 had wrapped up before half time as they continue their pursuit of leaders @entity15			2
@entity0 had not scored a free - kick since last march but when @entity17 was fouled 25 - yards out in a central position midway through the first half , he dipped a free - kick through the @entity21 that bounced just in front of @entity23			1
@entity0 ( right ) puts @entity3 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity6 with a 21st minute free - kick before the strike against @entity6 , @entity0 had n't scored a @entity28 free - kick in over a year the @entity3 star celebrates his strike with team - mates @entity32 ( centre ) and @entity34 ( left ) the 30 - year - old blows kisses to the @entity37 crowd as @entity3 take a 1 - 0 lead @entity3 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 ' ) , @entity34 ( @entity44 ' ) , @entity17 ( @entity45 61 ' ) , @entity46 , @entity32 , @entity47 , @entity10 , @entity0 subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goals : @entity0 21 , @entity54 ' , @entity47 ' @entity6 : @entity23 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity39 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 77 ' ) , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 45 ' ) , @entity65 , @entity58 ( @entity66 66 ' ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 booked : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity61 ref : @entity74 att : 73,965 the @entity6 goalkeeper was already travelling to his right and when the ball spun like an off - break to the keeper ’s left he was left floundering at his near post as the ball crossed the line			1
despite his recent poor conversion rate from free - kicks , @entity3 ’s goal machine has now scored 16 goals from direct set - pieces – only @entity88 can match that in the last 20 years in @entity90			1
@entity3 were up against @entity28 ’s smallest club who were playing a league game at the @entity94 for the first time in their history			1
@entity3 had @entity97 making only his ninth start of the season for the rested @entity49 but he was seeing little more of the action that he usually does from the bench in a one - sided first half			1
@entity3 could have gone ahead after 16 minutes when @entity0 tried but failed to make contact with an @entity40 cross with an ambitious bicycle kick			1
the rebound came out to @entity107 but he hit his shot wide			0
@entity0 then forced a corner with a blocked shot and from it real managed to hit the crossbar , both posts , and had a goal ruled out for offside all inside 10 seconds			0
@entity0 flicked the corner kick on to @entity42 who hit the bar with a header			2
the ball rebounded to @entity32 whose shot hit one post , rolled along the line and hit the other , before coming out to @entity10			0
in the team ahead of the rested @entity50 , he scored , but from an offside position			0
@entity125 made the most of a rare start for @entity3 by doubling @entity3 's lead in the 31st minute @entity10 watches on as his header beats @entity6 goalkeeper @entity23 ( left ) it was impossible to come any closer and sure enough @entity3 scored with their next chance as @entity0 rammed home that set - piece			1
he should have doubled the lead a minute later but just failed to reach @entity10 ’ cross			0
@entity11 ’s on - loan @entity137 has become increasingly frustrated by his lack of chances in @entity90			0
he will not stay beyond this summer but there will be no shortage of clubs interested in a forward whose strike rate is comfortably inside one goal a game			0
on 31 minutes @entity40 crossed and he angled a clever and powerful header home to make it 2 - 0			1
it was his first goal in the @entity94 and his fifth for the club			0
the @entity11 loanee striker celebrates just his fifth goal in @entity3 colours the @entity3 players celebrate @entity10 's header during the 3 - 0 victory against @entity28 minnows @entity6 just before half time @entity34 drove forward and laid the ball off to @entity0 in space			1
his fierce low shot forced a fine save from @entity23 who had performed well since flapping at that spinning @entity0 free - kick			1
@entity3 coasted through the second half			2
they were able to withdraw @entity17 , @entity42 and @entity34 on the hour with thoughts already turning towards tuesday ’s @entity3 derby @entity167 quarter - final against @entity168			2
it was a gamble to make all three changes so early despite the 2 - 0 advantage and @entity172 almost paid for it when on 70 minutes @entity66 clattered into @entity43 who in - turn fell into keeper @entity39			2
both the keeper and @entity43 , who had come on for @entity42 , needed treatment but were able to continue			0
@entity176 will also be back for tuesday ’s @entity167 first leg			0
he sat this one out as a precaution after taking a knock on the thigh in midweek			0
@entity3 coped without him and his replacement @entity47 who scored the third on 83 minutes			2
he was quiet throughout in @entity176 ’s right wing position but showed strength and skill to work an opening on the right hand edge of the penalty area before burying a shot in @entity23 ’s far corner			0
@entity34 jumps over the tackle of @entity6 's @entity191 during the @entity28 clash at the @entity37 @entity90 star @entity47 fired @entity3 into a commanding 3 - 0 lead during the closing stages @entity47 was quiet throughout in @entity176 ’s right wing position but showed strength and skill to score @entity3 boss @entity172 shouts instructions to his players during the @entity28 clash			1

@entity0 gives @entity3 the lead with first - half free kick
