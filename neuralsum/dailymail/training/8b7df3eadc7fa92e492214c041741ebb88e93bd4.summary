by @entity1 reporter published : 07:17 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 24 july 2012 @entity2 and @entity3 have brought forward their wedding to that their son @entity6 can take part the parents of an 18 - month - old who has an untreatable brain tumour have brought their wedding forward four months so their little boy can be a page boy before he dies			1
@entity13 has been battling a grade - four tumour since he was diagnosed in april , but last week doctors told his parents @entity2 and @entity3 that his condition is terminal			1
the couple , from @entity19 , @entity20 , say the news has ' crushed and devastated them ' , and want to make the time @entity6 has left special - starting with him being page boy at their wedding			1
they are also raising funds to take him on a dream holiday to @entity29			0
father @entity2 , 24 , a private with the @entity31 , said : ' we 're trying to cram as much into the weeks he has left so that he 's happy , and so we have some good memories - because memories are all we 'll have after he 's gone			1
' he and fiancee @entity3 , 25 , first noticed that @entity6 was unwell at @entity35 , when he starting being sick , but they put it down to his feeding			1
in the next few months , they noticed he was wobbling around a lot , and being sick			0
they took him to their gp who told them @entity6 had a virus			1
two weeks before @entity6 stopped walking because he was so weak			1
they took him to nearby @entity48 , where again they were reassured it was just a virus			2
unconvinced , after @entity52 they returned to the hospital , where a @entity54 revealed a tumour on @entity6 's brain			1
on april 17 , surgeons at @entity58 operated on little @entity6 - but unfortunately they could not remove a small part of the tumour			1
@entity6 was started on chemotherapy three weeks later , and doctors tested his spine and brain fluid which was found to be clear of cancer			1
@entity66 , 42 , said : ' @entity67 was very poorly during the chemo			0
every side - effect you could think of , he got			0
he lost his spark , it was really hard to watch			0
' it was a very tough time for the whole family , watching @entity6 being so poorly			0
' @entity6 , left , before he became unwell , and right , during treatment despite the family 's hopes that @entity6 would pull through , at the beginning of july doctors found a shadow on the back of his neck during an mri scan			1
although they could not confirm it was a tumour , they told the family that it was a cluster of cells which could develop into a tumour			2
they also tested his brain and spinal fluid again - and devastatingly found that it was riddled with cancer			2
@entity66 , who runs a beauty salon , said : ' unfortunately last thursday the doctors told us that there was nothing more they could do , and they were going to stop the treatment			2
' they 've told us to make the most of being with him , to do what he can do before he gets too ill. ' the family are planning to take @entity6 on two caravan holidays , to @entity104 , as well as a dream holiday to @entity29 with the help of @entity108 's charity make a dream			0
surgeons at @entity58 could not remove all of @entity6 's brain tumour @entity112 and friends have been generous in their donations , raising Â£ 5,000 so far , but the family are still intent on raising more to make sure their little ' @entity115 ' can live life to the full			1
doctors have not been able to put a time on his life , @entity66 explained , adding : ' they said it could be weeks or months			1
but they said @entity6 had done well to live this long with his tumour			2
' they said if it was an adult , they would n't have lived this long , but because @entity6 's skull is soft the tumour has been able to grow so much			2
' @entity3 , who already has two girls , @entity128 , eight , and five - year - old @entity129 , has managed to get her wedding dress made in time and the photographer , cars and venue - the @entity135 in @entity136 - were rearranged when they decided to bring the wedding forward			0
@entity2 said : ' we are just devastated - it 's like our whole world has been crushed			0
' it feels like we are in a bubble , we 're just trying to get on with things as best we can and keep ourselves busy			0
' @entity6 's nothing like he was before he was diagnosed and he never will be again , but since he finished his chemotherapy he has been much happier - smiling and dancing - he loves to dance			2
' but his condition will only get worse			0
every day we see him getting a little bit weaker and it 's heartbreaking			0
' we just want him to be at the wedding - it would n't be special if he was n't there			0
