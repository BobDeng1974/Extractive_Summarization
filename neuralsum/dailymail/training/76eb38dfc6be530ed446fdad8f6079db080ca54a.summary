@entity35 , of the @entity36 , said : ‘ it is the birthright of children in this country to become familiar with its identity – including its religious identity – which is , broadly speaking , @entity4			2
‘ moving from the nativity of @entity44 to the nativity of the @entity8 shows the extent to which assemblies have become degraded			0
’ but @entity21 head @entity48 said only a quarter of his pupils were from a @entity4 background , so the school did not have ‘ a specifically @entity4 focus ’			2
