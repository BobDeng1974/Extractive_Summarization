a mysterious round white object was filmed whizzing around a passenger plane above @entity5 , the capital of @entity6 , on april 7			1
the clip , which has been uploaded to @entity8 , begins with the ‘ craft ’ at the bottom of the screen , keeping pace with the passenger plane			1
but then it speeds up and rises in altitude before zipping off out of shot , just as the startled person filming it tries to zoom in for a closer look			1
the video was uploaded by @entity8 user ‘ @entity42 ’ , who commented : ‘ it looks a little bit strange and not really similar to the other videos			1
if it 's really real and not a fake , it looks like a kind of military drone			2
’ several @entity8 users are convinced it ’s a @entity22 of some sort , but others remain sceptical			2
the @entity22 suddenly rises upwards as the person filming tries to zoom in gone : the @entity22 whizzes up and out of shot in the blink of an eye @entity52 said : ‘ when stabilised , it is easy to see what is going on with the video			2
‘ the edges of the @entity22 are not blurred like all of the other background objects , it seems like a separate effect from the background , and in fact you can see edge noise on the shape of the @entity22 indicating it 's a fake			0
‘ it does n't even look right if you start to look at it hard , especially slowed down frame by frame			0
’ user vicariousjojoe agreed , writing : ‘ people , you should know by now what is fake and what 's not			0
you can always tell by the way the camera moves and zooms			0
’ possible @entity22 activity has recently been sighted much closer to home , with a star - gazer filming intriguing footage of a glowing @entity22 , which he says he spotted hovering over the @entity83 in february			1
the man , identified only as @entity86 , recorded the phenomenon as he drove past the river at night , he said			0
the mysterious , oval aircraft can be seen suspended in the air displaying several amber - gold lights of varying sizes .			0

the white round object was spotted above @entity5 in @entity6
