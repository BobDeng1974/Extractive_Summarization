by @entity0 last updated at 1:37 am on 29th october 2011 she was once the darling of the pop industry , selling millions of albums and performing to packed - out stadiums			2
but in the decade since she first topped the charts , it seems @entity8 may have lost her sparkle – and a fair chunk of her fan base			0
the 29 - year - old opened her latest @entity14 tour on thursday night to an almost half - empty arena , according to spectators			1
@entity17 ( almost ) all : @entity8 kicked off the @entity19 leg of her @entity14 tour at the @entity21 last night with a selection of risque costumes far from full : @entity19 's @entity24 ten minutes before the show gets under way and the @entity30 singer apparently did little to dispel her recent reputation for lacklustre performances , reportedly singing only one song live in its entirety , the ballad @entity27 , and dancing lethargically			1
there was one more familiar note to the show , though – the skimpy costumes			0
appearing noticeably fuller - figured than on previous tours , the mother of two donned a number of revealing outfits at the @entity24 in @entity19 , including a pink basque with tights and a bejewelled bra top paired with shorts			2
it has been reported that hundreds of tickets have failed to sell for her @entity50 tour			0
and in the run up to it , @entity52 , whose first single got to number one in 1999 , has faced criticism over scenes in the video for her new single criminal , in which she brandishes a gun in riot - ravaged @entity60 , @entity19			0
revealing : the mother of two donned a number of skimpy outfits , including a pink basque with tights and a bejewelled bra top paired with shorts all together now : one one rare occasion @entity8 's dancers ' ensembles matched hers coming off : as usual it did n't take long for the singer to remove her jacket @entity74 ? @entity8 sang a ballad backed by huge white feathered wings - at odds somewhat with her black stage leotard , boots and fishnets getting close : @entity8 's dancers looked ready to devour the star in her pink pleather suit			1
