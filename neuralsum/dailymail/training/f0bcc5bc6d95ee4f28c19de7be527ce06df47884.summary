extraordinary : dr @entity1 faces claims he deliberately misdiagnosed parents with mental disorders - decisions which meant their children were taken away from them a leading psychiatrist faces extraordinary claims he deliberately misdiagnosed parents with mental disorders – decisions which meant their children were taken away from them			1
dr @entity1 faces being struck off over his conclusions that hundreds had ‘ personality disorders ’ after assessing them at his private family centre			1
he was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by social services for the reports which tore children from their parents – many of them young mothers			1
he is now being investigated over shocking suggestions he distorted the assessments to fit the view of social services			1
in one case , he is alleged to have wrongly diagnosed a ‘ caring ’ new mother – named only as @entity26 – with bipolar disorder because her local authority wanted the baby adopted			2
after being confronted with this allegation , dr @entity1 offered to surrender his licence to practise as a doctor rather than face a @entity35 inquiry			1
but his request has been rejected by the @entity35 which says there are still ‘ unresolved concerns regarding his fitness to practise ’			2
he will now face a full fitness to practise hearing			0
yesterday @entity43 mp , who has raised concerns about @entity45 in @entity46 , described the claims as shocking			2
the @entity49 mp – alerted by a whistle - blower – said he had since spoken to ‘ three or four ’ other families who said the same had happened to them			1
he has written to justice secretary @entity52 demanding a full parliamentary inquiry			1
mr @entity43 said : ‘ he is someone about whom a number of people have complained			0
i am told that at least one person has refused to work for him because of what she saw as his unethical provision of reports to suit the demands of local authorities			0
@entity62 : two porsches can be seen parked outside the home of @entity45 near @entity65			0
at one point in 2010 , when he had 11 residents in the centre at one time , dr @entity1 was raking in more than £ 40,000 a week ‘ much of the decision making in care proceedings rests on reports from experts such as dr @entity1 , ’ he told @entity46			1
he added that supposedly independent experts such as dr @entity1 , 59 , were often little more than ‘ the hired gun of the local authority ’			1
the lack of transparency over such experts was leading to ‘ thousands of miscarriages of justice in care proceedings ’			2
earlier this week , a study for the @entity84 revealed how life - changing decisions about the care of children are routinely being made on the basis of flawed evidence			0
a fifth of ‘ experts ’ who advise the family courts are unqualified			0
dr @entity1 charged local authorities £ 6,000 a week for every family in his care and £ 210 an hour just to read documents such as medical records			1
by 2007 his company , assessment in @entity102 , was making a profit of around £ 460,000 a year from his lucrative arrangement with social services			2
he is now worth more than £ 2.7million			0
last night a black @entity106 , thought to be worth around £ 120,000 , and a grey @entity108 , worth around £ 80,000 , were parked on the gravel driveway outside his £ 500,000 country cottage			0
a former honorary lecturer at @entity113 , who has previously advised the government on care assessments , dr @entity1 left the @entity116 to set up his private assessment centre in 2000			1
since then , hundreds of parents in contact with social services – usually mothers and babies – have been referred to his centre to be assessed			1
concerns were first raised in 2007 , when mother @entity26 complained that dr @entity1 had wrongly diagnosed her with a bipolar disorder			2
one consultant psychiatrist accused @entity45 of having ‘ no evidence ’ for some of his claims and of deliberately ‘ exaggerating ’ and ‘ misrepresenting ’ aspects of the woman ’s behaviour			0
her report is among a number of documents being examined by the @entity35 with regards to dr @entity1			2
@entity26 , who has seen her son just a few times since , said dr @entity1 was ‘ corrupt and evil			1
’ ‘ nothing will ever make up for what he has done to me and my child , ’ @entity26 said			0
‘ i want to make sure this man is exposed and that he can never do this to anybody else			0
’ in a letter sent to @entity26 , a @entity35 investigations officer confirmed @entity45 ‘ has now applied for voluntary erasure from the medical register ’			0
in demand : dr @entity1 was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by social services for reports which tore children from their parents - many of them young mothers the letter continued : ‘ he has no intention of returning to clinical practice in the future			1
’ however , the @entity35 officer concluded it was in the ‘ public interest ’ for his request to be denied ‘ in view of the nature of the performance allegations and in the view of the conduct concerns			2
’ he has not been available for comment at his two - storey detached cottage in the small village of @entity173 near @entity65			0
his assessment centre next to his home appeared to be closed			0
a spokesman for @entity45 at the @entity177 , the indemnity organisation for doctors , said professional confidentiality meant dr @entity1 was ‘ unable to comment on allegations raised in relation to care of a patient ’			1
@entity183 , of @entity184 , who represents @entity26 , said : ‘ our client has instructed us to launch proceedings against @entity45 and the local authority			0
‘ we believe this distressing case may be the tip of a very big iceberg			0

dr @entity1 could be struck off over his conclusions that hundreds of parents had ‘ personality disorders ’
