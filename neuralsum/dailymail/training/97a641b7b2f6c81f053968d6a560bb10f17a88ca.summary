by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 09:40 est , 14 december 2012 a mother whose two young children were fatally stabbed dozens of times in their beds by their cardiologist father has revealed her outrage that he has been freed after just three years			2
dr. @entity7 has lambasted the court system for letting her ex-husband , @entity9 , walk the streets of @entity11 - and potentially practice medicine again - after killing their children in 2009			1
@entity9 confessed to stabbing five - year - old @entity15 20 times and three - year - old @entity18 19 times but , a year later , a @entity20 jury failed to convict him of the murders , citing mental illness			1
he testified that he did not remember killing the children and had not wanted to , but that pressure of his crumbling marriage had sparked blackouts			1
dr. @entity27 had left him for her personal trainer			0
he is now a free man and said he intends to re-apply for his medical license			1
he also said he hopes to fall in love again and have more children , the @entity43 reported			1
in his trial , two psychiatrists for the defense testified @entity9 could not have known what he was doing , but dr. @entity27 told @entity50 she does not believe his claims of mental illness			1
' we have a person that is a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident , not at all , ' she said			0
' i have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger to society or is mentally insane			0
killer : @entity9 , a @entity69 cardiologist , said he blacked out at the time of the killings due to stress over his crumbling marriage			1
he was not convicted of the murders due to mental illness murdered : three - year - old @entity76 , left , and five - year - old @entity15 , right , died from their stab wounds ' i have to respect [ the jury 's ] decision but it confronts me and my values because i think they did n't do their job			1
' @entity27 told @entity86 she has spent a year researching similar cases and has seen large disparities in the results depending on the judge , the experience of the lawyers and even how rich the defendant is , as it influences the quality of the defense			0
she added that she now lives in fear of what her ex-husband could do next			0
' what brought him to do that is still there , ' she said			0
' is it going to be me ? is it going to be another woman ? ' in court : the jury did not convict @entity9 in 2009 and he has been undergoing therapy ever since last sighting : the children had gone to @entity9 's home for a movie night			1
they are pictured with him on surveillance footage picking up films from a store on the night they were killed @entity9 , who was never convicted of murder , has re-applied for his medical license			1
when he worked as a cardiologist , he never had any complaints brought against him			0
yet former health minister @entity122 told @entity123 that he doubts @entity9 will ever be able to practice medicine again			2
@entity122 said that in light of his actions , it is unlikely @entity9 will be able to regain his licence			2
' he did something very important , ' @entity122 said			0
but the decision will be down to the @entity131			0
' the college wo n't accept that , ' @entity132 said			0
' i do n't want to decide for the college , but if you look at it , it 's going to be very difficult for him to practice again			0
' she said that she is still haunted by the deaths of her children , who were also covered in defensive wounds			2
her son did not have one single fatal wound , so she knows he died a long , painful death			0
' to know that my children faced the person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by themselves to die , no one holding their hand , ' @entity27 said as she struggled to contain her tears			2
' i struggle all the days , every day of my life , and i think until i die i will struggle			0
' the release has outraged @entity69 residents and even the @entity20 government has called @entity9 's release on thursday ' unacceptable '			1
' we believe that @entity7 does not deserve to live in fear of her children 's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across @entity20 , ' said federal cabinet minister @entity164			1
prime minster @entity166 's government is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities , yet it will not influence @entity9 's case			2
happier times : @entity9 , who is re-applying for his medical license , hopes to have more children rage : his ex-wife believes @entity9 killed their children out of revenge for her leaving him for another man torn apart : dr @entity27 said she lives in fear of her former husband hurting others when he is released for now , he has been released on conditions that he does not contact his ex-wife or her family , that he continues his therapy and that he lives at an address approved by the @entity40			1
he is not taking any medication for mental illness , @entity50 reported			1
the release comes after @entity9 underwent six months of regular therapy , which he said has left him less anxious , @entity86 reported			2
he said he is able to deal with stress better now			0
@entity194 has been overseeing his mental health for the past six months and said he is ' really satisfied ' with the change in the man , and believes he does not present a short - term danger			2
@entity199 has filed an appeal in the case , which will be heard in the new year			0

@entity9 admitted to killing @entity15 , 5 , and @entity76 , 3 , in 2009 but said he had blacked out and could not remember murders
claimed he was struggling with recent *separation* from wife
@entity20 jury did not convict him , citing mental illness
@entity9 is now free , re-applying for his medical license and said he hopes to have children again
