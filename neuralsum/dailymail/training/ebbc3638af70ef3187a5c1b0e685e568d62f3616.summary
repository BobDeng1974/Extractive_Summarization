by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ @entity3 mocking : @entity5 paper @entity4 the @entity5 press have revelled in @entity4 ’s demise			1
@entity9 ’s front page showed a picture of @entity11 with the headline ‘ the lad from @entity14 ’			1
and sports daily @entity15 had a mock - up of @entity18 ’ @entity20 album cover with @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 walking across the zebra crossing with the headline : ‘ @entity17 ’			1
it was as much as they deserved			2
light blue invasion @entity29 is just a few hours ’ drive from @entity30			2
and guess who play there on wednesday ? yes , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 will sign off from the group stage against @entity37 and the @entity5 authorities are predicting 200,000 @entity30 fans descending on the port city			1
@entity42 's rubbish draw @entity42 supporters armed themselves with blue bin bags during their side ’s 0 - 0 draw with @entity47			1
fans made sure the @entity50 was left as they found it after the dire @entity52 clash in @entity53			0
but the bags proved to be dual - purpose and were also used to cheer on their side			0
@entity5 newspaper @entity56 had to pulp 30,000 copies after they ran a hoax interview with a @entity61 lookalike			1
to add to the confusion over the first name of @entity64 and @entity66 / @entity65 , he ’s @entity67 on official team sheets			0
name game : @entity65 's ( left ) first name can be spelt in many different ways causing confusion for football fans best of the bets each day , @entity77 's top tipsters @entity75 and @entity78 go head to head with their best bets			2
best bet @entity83 7 - 2 : @entity33 , used to getting what he wants , has called for @entity86 coach @entity85 to go for the kill against @entity88			0
that should mean @entity90 starts and he is a value pick to score the first goal			0
best bet @entity94 8 - 1 : you have to admire @entity88 ’s stubborn resistance against @entity37 , even if there was nothing else to admire in that game			0
@entity33 is a tad better than @entity101 and @entity30 can still win with a four - goal handicap .			0
