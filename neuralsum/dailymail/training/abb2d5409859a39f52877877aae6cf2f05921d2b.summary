for the first time since the 9/11 attack , the federal government has recognized that people who lived near @entity4 and first responders got cancer from toxic dust from the scene			1
the @entity9 announced the findings ahead of the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attack tomorrow			1
the institute is responsible for deciding whether cancer should be among the illnesses covered by the @entity15 and @entity16			1
around 50 cancers are included			0
the ruling means thousands of people who are sure they got sick in the aftermath of the outrage will be eligible for compensation			1
tragedy : an estimated 3,000 people were killed when the terrorists hijacked passenger jets and flew them into the @entity27 in @entity28 and the @entity29 in @entity30 on 9/11 deadly fumes : the @entity31 did not cover cancer because there was not enough evidence linking it to the toxins emitted at @entity4 after the terrorist attack legacy : @entity40 , with his daughter , inspired a law to compensate 9/11 rescue workers exposed to toxins at the site @entity45 , a lawyer who represent thousands of first responders and residents , told the @entity48 : ' there ’s new scientific evidence that dust is what is now linked to not only the respiratory illnesses , but all these cancers			1
' @entity55 , an @entity56 detective who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2003 after working months at @entity4 and the fresh kills landfill said : ' it ’s a bittersweet thing			1
it took 11 years to do what should have been done a long time ago			0
' the @entity31 - named after @entity56 detective @entity40 , who died age 34 after working on the @entity27 pile - was passed into law two years ago			1
under the @entity16 $ 2.8 billion was set aside to compensate people made ill by exposure to toxins at the site			1
another $ 1.5 billion has been allocated over five years to fund the @entity70 , which treats and monitors about 40,000 first responders			1
analysis showed that the substances in the dust from the collapse of the @entity27 's twin towers included cement , gypsum , asbestos , glass fibers , calcium carbonate , lead and other metal particles and toxins			1
it is believed that exposure to this dust through the lungs and skin has contributed to the asthma , gastrointestinal problems , and possibly the increased cancer risk experienced by rescue workers , especially those who were on the site immediately after the attack , when the cloud of debris dust was its thickest			1
the ph of the dust was very high , meaning it was highly alkaline and extremely caustic			0
@entity100 causes lung and other types of cancer , while lead and other heavy metals can be toxic to the brain			1
dr @entity107 , dean for global health at the @entity109 in @entity28 , said : ' a lot of the respiratory diseases and the gastroesophageal reflux disease we 're seeing in the 9/11 responders is the direct consequence of inhaling this toxic dust			1
' " it lands in the sinuses and bronchial tubes , causing irritation , redness and swelling			0
' source : @entity124 it originally did not cover cancer because there was not enough evidence linking it to the toxins emitted at @entity4			1
' to me , it 's common sense			0
if you breathe in toxic fumes , you 're going to get cancer , ' said @entity137 rep @entity135 , a @entity139 @entity138 who helped author the bill			2
but even @entity142 conceded that it is difficult to find hard data proving the connection between cancer and the dust at ground zero			2
that 's why in crafting the @entity31 , lawmakers were careful to include mechanisms that would allow for illnesses to be added based on new scientific research			1
this was despite thousands of responders claiming top be sick because of their part in the rescue efforts			2
about 400 first responders or people who lived near the site have died from cancer since 9/11 , according to the most recent estimates			1
with the inclusion of cancer in the program , there will be more victims seeking compensation yet no increase in the $ 2.77billion fund - meaning individual rewards will be lower			2
@entity171 , a smoker who suffers from lung disease and sleep apnea , told the @entity48 : ' they ’re going to add cancers , but are they going to add more money to the fund ? ' it ’s crazy			0
every time , we got ta fight			0
it ’s two years since @entity180 signed that bill and nobody ’s got ten cents			0
' the @entity184 ’s special master , @entity183 , has been responsible for evenhandedly distributing $ 2.7 billion to ground zero responders and others who became ill after being exposed to dust and ash from the smoldering ruins of the @entity27			2
attorney : @entity183 has been responsible for evenhandedly distributing $ 2.7 billion to @entity4 responders and others who became ill after being exposed to dust and ash from the smoldering ruins of the @entity27 toxic : many of the first responders and those who labored at the site in the months following the attacks suffer from a variety of respiratory ailments after working at the @entity27 site choking : people , seen masking their mouths from the pitch - dark dust , run @entity27 's collapse she will be permitted to spend only $ 875 million of the fund ’s total in the first five years after the initial payments begin			1
@entity212 , a 17 - year firefighter who worked on @entity4 , was diagnosed with brain cancer in march 2011 after those five years pass , people with valid claims will begin to receive their remaining portion of the additional $ 1.9 billion			1
in the two years since the law was passed , about 40,000 responders and survivors receive monitoring and 20,000 get treatment for illnesses as part of the @entity70			2
with time still left to submit claims , some people are holding out in the event that they become sick in the near future			2
others are waiting until the @entity9 officially adds 14 broad categories of cancer to the list of conditions covered by the fund			1
recently diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma , 55 - year - old @entity234 hopes he can secure money from the fund to support his wife and children in case he takes a turn for the worst			0
@entity234 , a retired firefighter who helped clear away the mountain of rubble at ground zero , believes there 's little doubt his work at the site is responsible for his illness			2
' you 've got people in this city who went down there and did what we had to do			2
and a lot of us got sick because of it , ' @entity234 said			0
' to make us now fight for this money , it 's not right			0
in the grand scheme of things , this money 's a drop in the bucket			0
' victim : mr @entity212 was one of 40,000 construction workers , firefighters and police officers who labored on what became known as the @entity270 , the mountain of debris that had been the twin towers of the @entity27 @entity274 was one of 40,000 construction workers , firefighters and police officers who worked tirelessly on what became known as the @entity270 , the mountain of debris that had been the twin towers of the @entity27			0
in march 2011 , mr @entity212 was diagnosed with a rare lymphoma , a cloud - like mass on the front of his brain			0
the tumor was unusual in being a primary , the disease commonly spreading to the brain from another part of the body he underwent months of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant last august			0
his last four mris have showed no sign of the cancer , he told @entity296 , but he fears it is only a matter of time until it comes back			0
' this is n't just for me , ' he said of the coverage			0
' this is for everybody else			0
first of all , i 'm lucky enough to be talking to you			0
but what about the guy who could lose his house trying to pay his medical bills ? '			0

the @entity9 is expected to announce the findings tomorrow
about 400 first responders or people who lived near the site have died from cancer since 9/11
the @entity31 originally did not cover cancer because there was not enough evidence linking it to the toxins emitted at @entity4
