by @entity0 @entity1 knows it 's time to live up to his name at the @entity4 and that spells bad news for the @entity7 who face @entity9 in the @entity10			1
as the @entity9 side trained in the stadium on monday , the @entity12 playmaker is aware his country is counting on a match - long display of hazard dazzle in the crucial last 16 clash on tuesday			1
' in this @entity4 , i have yet to play a great match , even if i had good moves which were decisive , ' @entity1 acknowledged			0
@entity1 ( left ) looked in relaxed mood as he did tricks in training on monday @entity9 captain @entity26 could again having missed the last group game with a groin injury @entity29 : @entity26 and the instructions from coach @entity31 for tuesday 's game are clear because he expects @entity1 ' to take charge of the match ' and ' impose himself as a leader			1
' unlike the players who have confirmed their star status at the @entity4 , like @entity38 for @entity39 and @entity40 for @entity41 , @entity1 is still finding his range			2
within @entity43 he is one of the half dozen best creative players , but at the @entity4 so far he has n't consistently delivered on that potential			0
@entity9 has escaped with two victories in the games @entity1 was starting , each time with the playmaker providing decisive assists			1
in both games , he was playing below par until those big moments			2
@entity54 might have been a flop at @entity56 last season but he is an integral part of the @entity9 side goalkeeper @entity60 prepares to face the @entity7 on tuesday ' they are asking me to be decisive , and it has been tough , ' @entity1 said			1
the responsibility falling on the 23 - year - old @entity12 playmaker could be even bigger on tuesday if @entity26 , captain and undisputed leader of team , is still sidelined with an injured groin			1
' a lot is asked from a guy who has already given us a lot , ' said @entity31 , even though the coach himself has publicly said more was expected from @entity1			0
' i am sure that we will see a great @entity1 who will be decisive again , ' midfielder @entity75 said			0
time and again in group play , @entity1 's creativity was stifled by defensive lineups which contained him until they were too fatigued			2
@entity7 will see a better @entity1 hazard has struggled to make a major impact in @entity39 so far ' it was tough to express myself , ' @entity1 said			1
' there was very little space against teams that defended fully			0
' he expects it to change on tuesday because unlike the group matches , teams have to come looking for a goal to go through			0
' if they want to go through , they will have to move up field because we defend well , ' @entity1 said			0
' and i hope it will open space so i can show a very good @entity98			0
' given space , his first - touch football , feints and pinpoint passing has disarmed some of the best defenses in the world			0
and do n't underestimate the quality of his freekicks			0
' i hope they will commit fouls because it will bring freekicks , ' said @entity1			0
he is also coming off more than a week of good rest , disregarding five minutes of play against @entity116 , while the @entity118 defenders are coming off a tough game against @entity120 last thursday			0
@entity9 coach @entity31 has said he thinks @entity122 will be fit @entity118 coach @entity123 knows all too well what he is up against			1
' you have to have a special eye on him			1
you have to double cover everything that goes out , you have to shift tremendously , ' @entity123 said monday			1
compounding the difficulties for the @entity118 defense should be the inclusion of creative midfielder @entity131 , who has been close to hazard all through @entity9 's youth ranks			1
he also was rested for the final group game , when @entity9 already had qualified			2
on the eve of the game , @entity135 announced that @entity139 defender @entity138 had not recovered fully from a right hamstring injury in time to be ready for tuesday 's match			2
if @entity9 advances into saturday 's quarterfinal in @entity143 , he 's likely to be available			2
@entity26 did train with the group on the eve of the game , but it was unclear how the injury reacted to the training session			2
@entity31 said he expected @entity54 to recover from calf soreness to be available for the @entity118 game			0
on the ball : @entity152 will be hoping to fire the @entity118 's to the quarter - finals on tuesday working up a sweat : @entity155 ( centre ) and his @entity7 team - mates are put through their paces at training out of reach ? @entity118 are looking to go one better than at the @entity161 when they lost in the last 16 @entity163 : @entity9			1

hazard has struggled to make an impact in @entity9 's games so far
@entity123 says @entity7 will have a ' special ' eye on the @entity12 star
@entity26 could return to @entity9 side after training on monday
