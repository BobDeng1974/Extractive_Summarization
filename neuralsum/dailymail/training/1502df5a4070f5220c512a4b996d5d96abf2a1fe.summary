by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 15:19 est , 21 august 2013 we 've all had those heart - sink moments when we 've opened the door to an unwanted salesman or uninvited neighbour			0
now there 's a new app that lets you know exactly who 's at your front door - and it works when you 're not at home			2
the app , called @entity14 , works with a tiny camera mounted to a doorbell - like button			1
when a visitor presses the bell it sends an alert and activates the camera so the owner can decide to answer the call , or reject it , depending on who is visiting			1
the device replaces the doorbell button and includes a camera , speaker , microphone , led light , infrared led ( night - vision ) and a motion sensor for people without an @entity30 or @entity29 device , a schoolboy has created a doorbell that fools burglars into believing somebody is home at an empty property but calls any mobile phone			1
@entity51 , designed by 13 - year - old @entity52 , dials the homeowner 's mobile phone when pressed , allowing them to talk to whoever is outside their front door			1
the device even produces a small amount of white noise to give any unexpected guest the impression they are speaking to someone inside the house on an intercom system			0
the invention , which uses an inbuilt sim card and existing mobile - phone technology , would also allow homeowners to give instructions to drivers making deliveries at their property			2
if answered , the owner can then speak to and hear the person at their front door , using the app on their @entity29 or @entity30 device			1
the owner can even do this when they 're not at home			0
the @entity14 app is free for @entity29 and @entity30 tablets and phones , but only works with the @entity14 device that costs Â£ 105			1
it replaces the doorbell button and connects to @entity90 before sending the alert to a mobile phone			1
the device itself includes a camera , speaker , microphone , led light , infrared led ( night - vision ) and a motion sensor			0
@entity101 , ceo of @entity14 , from @entity102 , explains how she and other co-founder @entity103 , 29 , came up with the idea			2
the 42 - year - old said : ' i was always on the go and wanted a solution to stay connected to my home while i was working or travelling			0
when a visitor presses the wall mounted button , left , the device connects to the home 's @entity90 network and sends an alert to the owner 's phone			1
the user can then decide to answer the call based on who is there , record them or take a picture , and speak to the visiting guest ' i then found comfort in the idea of always knowing who is at the door whether i was home or not - the idea took off from there			2
' one of the best things about @entity14 is the advanced feature set			0
we 're designing things that have not been done yet on a @entity90 doorbell			0
' this includes motion sensor call and image initiation , on - demand camera access , and a feature we call ' @entity143 ' mode			0
' you can even use the app to turn off your home 's doorbell so it does not wake a sleeping baby or disturb you while you 're working			0
' the @entity14 will help homeowners and other users feel safe by allowing them to see who is that their door and it gives them control over how they want to answer it			2

the @entity14 *smartphone* app works with a camera mounted to a doorbell
when a visitor presses the bell , the camera *begins* filming their face
images are sent *wirelessly* to the mobile phone so users can see who it is
the user can then see and hear the guest through the @entity30 and @entity29 app
