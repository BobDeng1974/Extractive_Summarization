by @entity0 published : 04:00 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 08:37 est , 6 june 2012 it 's certainly more alarming than your average pc warning message - ' we believe state - sponsored attackers are attempting to compromise your account			1
' @entity7 unveiled the ' last line of defence ' for users it believes may be under attack from foreign spies this week - and it seems the search giant will ' defend ' customers against spies from any country			1
the warning will pop up in @entity18 accounts @entity7 believes to be under attack			1
@entity7 remains coy about how big a threat state - sponsored hackers - spies - actually are , but the threat is widespread enough for @entity7 to build defences into @entity18			1
the warning will appear in the accounts of users @entity7 believes to have been the targets of foreign spies - although the firm will not reveal how it knows @entity7 has built warnings about cyber attacks by foreign agents into its popular @entity18 webmail service the warning will pop up if @entity7 believes an account may have been targeted by state hackers - although the firm refuses to reveal exactly how it knows			1
' we are constantly on the lookout for malicious activity on our systems , in particular attempts by third parties to log into users ’ accounts , ' said @entity7 in a blog post this week			1
' when we have specific intelligence — either directly from users or from our own monitoring efforts — we show clear warning signs			2
today , we ’re taking that a step further for a subset of our users , who we believe may be the target of state - sponsored attacks			2
' the move comes in the wake of several high - profile cyber attacks originating in @entity56 which targeted @entity57 and other government officials			1
the @entity56 government has always denied that it is involved in cyber crime , claiming that it is a victim @entity63 chairman @entity62 : several high - profile hacks against @entity57 companies have been alleged to have state backing last year , hackers based in @entity68 , @entity56 targeted personal @entity18 and @entity70 accounts of government officials			1
the methods used suggested insider knowledge about the offiicals according to many observers			0
the @entity56 government denied any involvement			0
' blaming these misdeeds on @entity56 is unacceptable , ' said @entity56 foreign ministry spokesman @entity78 after the attacks			2
' @entity81 is an international problem and @entity56 is also a victim			0
the claims of so - called support for hacking are completely unfounded			0
' @entity7 says , ' if you see this warning it does not necessarily mean that your account has been hijacked			2
it just means that we believe you may be a target , of phishing or malware for example , and that you should take immediate steps to secure your account			0
' ' you might ask how we know this activity is state - sponsored			0
we ca n’t go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors , but our detailed analysis — as well as victim reports — strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state - sponsored			0
' ' we believe it is our duty to be proactive in notifying users about attacks or potential attacks so that they can take action to protect their information			2
and we will continue to update these notifications based on the latest information			0
' @entity56 is widely suspected of being the origin of many hacking attacks on government and commercial websites abroad , but officials have repeatedly dismissed reports that the government or military could be behind such attacks .			0
