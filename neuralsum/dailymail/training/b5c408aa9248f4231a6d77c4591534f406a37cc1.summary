by @entity0 collecting accurate , real - time data on earthquakes has always been a problem for seismologists			0
but a tiny sensor found in smartphones could help fill in the gaps by instantly turning your mobile phone into an earthquake sensor			0
the chip , originally intended to change the orientation of the screen , can detect earthquakes greater than a magnitude of 5 , according to a new study			1
@entity23 is also used in laptops to detect the motion of falling , and in computer games to sense movement and speed			2
@entity37 and @entity38 , both seismologists at the @entity40 in @entity41 , wanted to see whether the sensor could also reliably detect ground motion caused by earthquakes			2
the test showed that the @entity23 accelerometers could detect moderate to strong earthquakes , greater than magnitude 5 , such as the one that hit @entity50 earlier this month they tested the @entity23 accelerometer in an @entity53 and compared it to the earthquake sensor @entity56 force balance accelerometer			1
the test showed that the @entity23 accelerometers could detect moderate to strong earthquakes , greater than magnitude 5 , when located near the epicentre			1
the researchers believe the technology will soon be advanced enough to detect quakes less than magnitude 5			1
the real advantage , they say , is the widespread use of mobile phones and laptops that include @entity23 technology , making it possible to dramatically increase coverage when strong earthquakes occur			2
video : the @entity72 app developed by @entity73 their hope is to create an urban seismic network that could transmit real - time ground motion data to a central location			0
this is n’t the first time that smartphone sensors have been used to detect earthquakes			1
a few years ago , @entity73 , @entity83 released the free @entity72 app which turns your @entity53 into an earthquake - measuring device			0
any possible earthquake triggers are measured by your phone and instantly streamed back to our @entity73 servers for further processing and map generation			0
‘ the dense network of recorded shaking intensity data , and eventually other information , will have a significant impact on academia , industry , and government , ’ said the research team .			0

@entity23 sensors can detect earthquakes greater than a magnitude of 5
the chip is used in smartphones to change the orientation of the screen
the technology will soon be advanced enough to detect *smaller* quakes
