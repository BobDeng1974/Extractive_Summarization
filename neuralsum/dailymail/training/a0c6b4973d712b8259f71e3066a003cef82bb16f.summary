by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 07:16 est , 16 november 2012 this map reveals the startling number of @entity4 homeowners drowning in debt after being left locked in negative equity in the wake of the economic crisis			1
it shows the percentage of people who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth - classed as ' underwater ' homeowners - across the @entity4 by county			1
more than 14 million @entity4 were struggling in negative equity in the third quarter of the year , research has shown			1
' underwater ' : the map shows the percentage of homeowners in negative equity across the @entity4 by county the red counties on the map have more underwater homes than the national average of 28.2 per cent , while blue counties have fewer			1
in the @entity32 - @entity31 area of @entity33 41.4 per cent of homeowners are underwater , and 29.1 per cent of those owe more than double what their property is worth			2
in all 25.5 per cent of the area 's underwater owners are ' delinquent ' - meaning they are more than 90 days late on their mortgage repayments			0
other major cities badly hit hit include @entity45 , where 36.6 per cent of homeowners are in negative equity , and @entity48 , where 34.2 per cent are classed as underwater			2
despite the levels of debt , real estate specialist @entity50 said negative equity had in fact receded in the third quarter , which saw the biggest quarterly rise in property values since 2006			1
in the second quarter , an average of 30.9 per cent - 15.3 million homeowners - were underwater			2
' national home values appreciated 1.3 percent from @entity62 to q3 2012 , with much of that appreciation focused in hard - hit areas , like @entity65 , @entity33 and @entity66 , ' @entity50 told @entity67			0
but the firm 's chief economist @entity68 said house prices were still not immune to ' shocks ' from the broader economy			1
' while we 're moving in the right direction , a substantial number of homes are still locked up in negative equity , unable to enter the existing re-sale market despite the desires of their owner , ' he said			0
' while we 're moving in the right direction , a substantial number of homes are still locked up in negative equity ' economist @entity68 ' the housing market has found real momentum of its own , but is not immune from shocks to the broader economy			1
if negotiations centred on resolving the fiscal cliff do n't inspire confidence in investors and consumers alike , recent home value gains - and , as a result , falling negative equity rates - could stall , ' mr @entity68 added			1
the collapse in the @entity4 housing market is widely regarded as a root cause of the global economic crisis			0
property prices peaked in 2006 in the @entity101 before the housing bubble burst the following year			0
between 2004 and 2006 the percentage of risky subprime mortgages - those extended to borrowers with poor credit histories - rose to a new high of around 20 per cent			0
the vast majority were adjustable - rate mortgages , meaning interest rates vary according to the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets			0

the numbers of people defaulting on their payments soared as did the number of foreclosures			0
this , combined with simultaneous crashes in other asset bubbles , saw fears over the soundness of the @entity4 credit and financial markets lead to credit tightening around the world			0
