@entity7 - the socialist leader of @entity1 's parliament - told the president : ' the @entity1 do n't want everything we have put on display			1
' while urban affairs minister @entity13 told @entity1 's @entity15 television : ' it 's an outrage			2

urban affairs minister @entity13 , right , said : ' it 's an outrage			0
do you think the public would also like to see a picture of my wife in the nude ? ' mr @entity7 's defiant outburst on live radio after mr @entity0 told his entire cabinet to publish full details of their assets			1
the sudden drive for complete financial transparency came after it emerged that an ex-cabinet member had hidden up to 12 million pounds from the tax - man in a @entity42 bank			0
the publication of wealth then sparked charges of hypocrisy when it was revealed there were six millionaires in the president 's left - wing government			2
now mr @entity7 has told @entity52 : ' the majority of @entity1 people do n't want to live in a paparazzi democracy where everything is on show			1
@entity7 - the socialist leader of @entity1 's parliament - told the president : ' the @entity1 do n't want everything we have put on display ' ' there should be a way of protecting the private life of elected politicians while still maintaining controls			1
' @entity68 simply needs to have the power to investigate when there is doubt			0
' the @entity1 people only need to be reassured that their mps are honest and not using their positions to line their pockets			2
' other ministers also reacted with fury at being ordered to lay bare their personal finances to the public			0
following the ' voluntary ' declarations earlier this month , a new law on financial transparency among ministers and other top officials is now set to be adopted by the summer			0
the @entity85 tax scandal came as a massive blow to the credibility of mr @entity0 , who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging			1
the president hopes the declarations will restore faith in his flagging administration , but critics have accused him of knowing about and covering up @entity85 's tax dodging and of mismanagement for having believed his denials			0
mr @entity7 's attack on his leader also comes as a new poll this week revealed mr @entity0 has become the most unpopular president in five decades			1
his historically low approval rating of just 25 per cent of the population makes him even more unpopular than president @entity103 was in 1968 - when millions of @entity1 rioted to demand a complete overhaul of @entity1 society			2
mr @entity0 came to power in may 2012 amid a fanfare of promises to redistribute wealth and rebuild @entity1 's ailing public services			1
anger : @entity7 made the defiant outburst on live radio after mr @entity0 told his entire cabinet to publish full details of their assets but after eight months in the job , he has been humiliated by a catalogue of political , economic and personal crises and found himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of first lady @entity123			1
millionaires have been fleeing @entity1 in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros			2
the @entity1 equivalent of the @entity130 's @entity129 , called @entity131 , has warned the president that @entity1 risked becoming ' the poor man of @entity134 ' over his ' disastrous ' economic policies			2
the latest economic data shows households ' spending power has fallen for the first time since 1984 , and that jobless figures rose for a 22nd straight month in march to 10.6 per cent - the highest level since 1997			0
his girlfriend @entity123 , 47 , has also been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president			0
a spokesman for pollsters @entity148 said : ' he claimed to be the @entity152 president who would help the poor and sweep away the corruption of the @entity155 years			0
' but he has been hit on all sides , by the economy , his policies , corruption and personal attacks			0
no president has ever been re-elected after falling as low as this			0
