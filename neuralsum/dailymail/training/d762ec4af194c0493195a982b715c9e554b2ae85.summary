by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 09:15 est , 23 january 2014 after spending just 30 minutes at my desk , i 'm already rosy - cheeked and glowing			1
not from the joy of settling down to get some work done on my latest novel , but because i 'm using the very latest fitness import from the @entity8 as i type			1
treadmill desks - a small treadmill you plonk under your existing desk , or a table with an inbuilt one - have gone down such a storm with big corporations like @entity17 and @entity18 that they are now making their way over here			1
set at about 2mph ( the pace of a slow walk ) they burn up to 150 calories an hour while not distracting you from your work			1
their soaring popularity is thanks to growing research that says sitting down all day is killing us			2
just last week a study found that middle - aged women who are inactive for 11 hours a day are 12 per cent more likely to die prematurely and nearly 30 per cent more at risk from heart disease			2
for a start , your calorie - burning rate plunges by a third to around one calorie a minute , and you produce fewer of the enzymes that affect how fat is stored and sugar processed , leading to weight gain			0
high blood pressure , some cancers , diabetes and even depression have all been linked to sedentary lifestyles			0
and thanks to computers , tvs , laptops and cars , the average person now spends 12 hours a day sitting down			0
add seven hours of being horizontal while we sleep , and that leaves very little time for being upright			0
so could these radical new work stations be the answer ? as a 39 - year - old , work - from - home mum who struggles to find time to go to the gym - or even leave the house - i jump at the chance to try the @entity38 desk ( £ 899 )			1
i 'm 5ft 4ins and 9st 7lbs so i could do with shifting a few pounds , and sitting leaves me feeling lethargic and bloated			0
my enthusiasm dims somewhat after two fiddly , expletive - ridden hours of assembling the thing in my lounge			0
but once i 've stepped on to the treadmill , which stands under a height - adjustable desk in place of a chair , my excitement began to build			1
job training : standing up for three hours a day , five days a week , will burn 750 extra calories , which over a year equates to running ten marathons like mothers the world over , i 'm used to juggling several tasks at once , but work and exercise is a new one for me			1
with a ' 3 - 2 - 1 ' , the monitor provided a countdown and i was off on a 2 mph stroll			0
admittedly that 's very slow , but any faster and it would be impossible to tap away on the keyboard at the same time , and i would probably fall off the treadmill from the effort of coordinating brain and legs			1
it takes me about 15 minutes to get used to the motion , and each time i lose my balance , i have to hold on to the desk and spend a few minutes correcting my mistakes from hitting the wrong keys			1
it 's a lot like learning to drive - trying to move your feet independently of your hands			0
there is also the problem of dizziness when you step off the treadmill , but that is short - lived			1
however , that night , i slept far better , found it easier to get up in the morning and felt far calmer during the day			0
hard labour the treadmill was invented in 1818 as a ' human hamster wheel ' to punish prisoners by day three , that initial vertigo had been replaced by a feeling of real achievement as i dismounted , knowing i 'd woven some exercise into my busy day without much effort or disruption			1
in fact , i 'd walked a total of 15 miles without even realising it			0
when you 've got the hang of it , you do n’t forget you 're walking on a treadmill , but it feels totally normal			1
it 's only when a child or husband walks in laughing at the sight of you that you realise you do look a little ridiculous			0
it 's a small price to pay , however , for being able to burn off biscuits tone muscles , improve posture and boost metabolism			1
the statistics are impressive : standing up for three hours a day , five days a week , will burn 750 extra calories , which over a year equates to running ten marathons			0
apparently there are benefits to your mind and productivity , too			0
working at a standing desk can apparently increase your output by 10 per cent because your mind is more focused when your body is upright			1
@entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 were all advocates , albeit without any treadmill device underneath			2
i certainly found my work rate increasing - when i would have taken a break if i 'd been sitting at a desk , i felt so caught up in the rhythm of the treadmill that i carried on			1
the noisy whirr of the belt slid into the background after a while , and i was able to immerse myself in my writing			0
but since you 're advised to spend no more than two to three hours a day on the treadmill because of the risk of repetitive strain injury , i eventually had to step off			2
our writer soon got the hang of working and walking but the equipment is bulky to keep in a house my apparatus is just one of the many products exploding on to the market after the @entity191 recommended businesses offered their employees alternatives to sitting			1
now there are standing and bike desks , @entity197 ball chairs and even table - tennis meeting tables			2
@entity17 is one company in @entity200 's @entity199 that offers its staff alternatives to seats			1
@entity18 is another , with design recruiter @entity204 telling the @entity205 that workers ' energy levels soared when they used standing desks , and his own 3pm energy slump had long gone			1
but it 's likely we 'll have to wait a while for most @entity214 bosses to see standing at work as anything other than a gimmick			2
the ultimate test is whether i 'd i buy one of these gadgets myself			2
if i was lucky enough to live in a mansion , the answer would be yes , because size is definitely the issue			0
the desk i tried was super-heavy and 1.8m long			2
it needs a permanent home , preferably in a spare room - cum - office , and its beech finish wo n't be to everyone 's taste			0
but having it in the house does encourage other family members to use it and improve their fitness , too			0
i even caught my six - year - old son , @entity238 , having a go while playing on the @entity240			0
once the novelty had worn off though , he was n't at all pleased that his ' football pitch ' - otherwise known as the lounge - had disappeared under this unwieldy contraption			0
a quick word of advice for anyone taking the plunge - remember to tell anyone who phones you that you 're on a treadmill in case they think they 've caught you in a marital tryst			2
and if you 're going to drink coffee , invest in a tightly lidded mug			0
@entity0 's new book , @entity261 , is out now , published by @entity262 , for £ 7.99			1

apparatus is a small treadmill you put under your existing desk
