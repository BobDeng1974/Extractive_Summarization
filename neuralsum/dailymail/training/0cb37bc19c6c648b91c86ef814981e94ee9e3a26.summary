the first man , they said , was convicted of ' banditry and robbing @entity22 ' money ' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury			1
the second militants was accused of ' dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of @entity52 , ' according to the observatory			1

' @entity79 is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them			2
they do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia , such as usury or embezzlement , ' he said			0

the news comes as it emerged as many as 30 @entity36 may now have died fighting for terror groups in @entity7			1
researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with @entity1 and other groups but think the true figure is higher			0
despite the deaths and mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad , there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more @entity36 nationals			0
@entity1 militants fighting in @entity7 and @entity29 have released a new video showing fighters speaking in @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity121 making threats against @entity123 soldiers			1
saying they look forward to slaughtering any @entity123 ground troops sent to the region , the terrorists threatened to ' chop off the heads of whoever you may bring '			0
none of the men in the clip wear masks , although only three of them speak to the camera			0
one of the jihadists , identified by the @entity138 , speaks in a clear southern @entity118 accent , while the other two men identify themselves as @entity119 and @entity121 nationals respectively			0
@entity142 : one of the jihadists , identified by the @entity143 ( right ) , speaks in an @entity118 accent , while the other two men identify themselves as @entity119 and @entity121 nationals respectively showing chilling bravado , the man calling himself @entity143 urges @entity123 nations to send their troops to the region so that @entity59 can ' kill every single soldier , @entity151 permitting			2
' ' we will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die â€¦ you can not come into @entity29 and think that you will take it			1
we are willing to lay down our blood on this soil , ' he adds			0
gesticulating wildly , the @entity22 fanatic goes on to say : ' we will chop off the heads of the @entity164 , chop off the heads of the @entity119 , chop off the heads of whoever you may bring			1
' he goes on to insist that the @entity1 have no chose of losing the battle against the @entity171 because they are backed by @entity173 , before saying ' know that we are fighting to die ... and know that you are fighting for this world and that this is nothing to us			0
threat : gesticulating wildly , the @entity36 @entity22 fanatic goes on to say : ' we will chop off the heads of the @entity164 , chop off the heads of the @entity119 , chop off the heads of whoever you may bring ' referring to @entity123 airstrikes that have targeted @entity59 in recent weeks , including those that have forced militants to abandon key locations in and around the besieged @entity7 city of @entity189 , @entity143 insists that bombing raids ' will not divert us from our plans '			1
he says that strikes ' only strengthen us , and give us more purpose to be here ' before threatening to take the lives of any westerner fighting against @entity59 in @entity7 and @entity29			1
once @entity143 eventually stops talking , a man identified as @entity198 emerges in front of the camera and speaks in perfect @entity119 , with @entity118 subtitles appearing below			2
addressing his messages to ' the swine @entity204 ' , @entity198 reads out religious passages and accuses the @entity119 president of using his country 's wealth to turn people away from @entity210			0
we are also waiting , ' he says			0
' everybody knows how much money you and you coalition have spent and lost in your war against @entity210			2
' the young militant , who appears to be missing several teeth , goes on to say : ' a great defeat shall befall you because @entity151 has promised that			0
the coalition , will become the losers , ' he adds			0
addressing his messages to ' the swine @entity204 ' , @entity119 national @entity225 ( right ) references a 1,300 - year - old apocalyptic prophecy predicting war between @entity210 and an ' infidel horde ' @entity231 goes on to make references to a 1,300 - year - old apocalyptic prophecy that predicted a war between an @entity210 army and ' infidel horde ' in @entity7			2
@entity231 refers to @entity123 as ' @entity237 ' throughout his rant , in the hope of drawing similarities between the apocalyptic predictions in the hadith , and the modern reality of a coalition of armies aiming to destroy the terrorists that have been raping and the massacring their way around the @entity249			0
he finishes he message with the words : ' the reality is the @entity1 has returned			0
victory after victory it gains territory ... so die in your rage because this is the era of @entity210			0
' militant : once @entity198 finishes speaking , another militant identified as @entity262 ( centre ) steps in front of the camera and speaks in @entity121 , which is again subtitled in @entity118 once @entity198 finishes speaking , another militant identified as @entity262 steps in front of the camera and speaks in @entity121 , which is again subtitled in @entity118			2
he claims the video is being shot in the @entity7 town of @entity271 - where the aforementioned apocalyptic prophecy is predicted to play out - and urges @entity123 nations to send their armies to fight @entity59 because ' we have been waiting for you for over 1,400 years			2
