they 've advised me not to play or practice now			2

i 'll be cheering for the @entity47			0
i think we have an outstanding squad going into the matches			0
' after his surgery , @entity2 did not return to action until the end of june , missing the cut in the @entity56 and then finishing 69th in the @entity30 at @entity57 , his worst 72 - hole finish in a major in the paid ranks			1

' however , i think we can all agree that we need @entity2 in this great sport , and he has taken the high road by informing me early on in the selection process			0
