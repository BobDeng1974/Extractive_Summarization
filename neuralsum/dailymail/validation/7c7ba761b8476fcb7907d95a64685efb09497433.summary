@entity0 was at his brilliant , mesmerising best against @entity1 and the knee - jerkers have been out in full force proclaiming him as the greatest footballer of all time			1
steady on , boys and girls			2
@entity9 ’s little big man was just having fun with one of our pot - holed @entity13 defences			1
@entity0 ( second left ) was at his mesmerising best as @entity9 beat @entity1 on wednesday @entity0 ( left ) takes on @entity1 and @entity16 midfielder @entity15 in the game at the @entity18 @entity0 was repeatedly denied from getting on the scoresheet by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity21 's excellent display it was indeed a delight to watch @entity0 enjoying himself and it was hard to keep a straight face when he made a laughing stock of a player who has been described by his city manager as the complete @entity29 footballer			1
if @entity15 really is the complete @entity29 footballer that begins to tell us something of what ’s wrong with the @entity16 football team			0
@entity9 played football from a different planet to the @entity16 of which @entity1 are currently champions and @entity0 was the principle , be-dazzling reason for that			1
yet they only won 1 - 0 when it should have been six and could have been ten and @entity0 missed his share of those chances			1
but that is not the reason for resisting the temptation to enshrine him as the best ever			0
rather , sublime performances like this perpetuate the riddle as to why he has failed to fully deliver on the greatest stage of all			0
it is sometimes difficult to evaluate the best of the best when considering players who come from outside the elite footballing countries			2
@entity0 ( centre ) is adjudged to have fallen short of his high level of performance on the international stage @entity0 was part of the @entity63 squad that finished as runners - up in the @entity65 in @entity66 @entity0 has never won the @entity65 during his international career and his last chance could be @entity69 2018 but when someone plays for such a major nation as @entity63 then @entity65 impact weighs upon the calculation , in @entity0 ’s case against him			1
the tango he danced around poor old @entity76 was exquisite to behold but it does not erase the memory of how he fell short – not for the first time at the @entity79 – in @entity66 last summer			0
@entity69 2018 now represents his last chance to gate - crash this list of the top five players in the history of the beautiful game – and by the way i saw them all : 1 ) @entity89 @entity89 won the @entity65 three times as a player and scored over a thousand goals throughout his career @entity89 celebrates with the @entity95 trophy after being part of @entity66 's @entity97 winning side @entity66 striker @entity89 's other two victorious @entity65 campaigns were in the 1958 and 1962 tournaments there can be no arguing with the three @entity65 glories , the thousand goals , the rare art of making the impossible look simple , nor that extraordinary ability in the air for the comparatively short man who will be guest of honour at @entity111 v @entity110 this sunday			1
and by the way , he was also as hard as nails			0
2 ) @entity114 not only as mind - boggling to watch on the ball as @entity0 but capable of winning the glittering prizes single - handed – as he did in lifting @entity63 to one @entity65 triumph and , when virtually crippled , to the final of another			1
@entity114 celebrates winning the @entity65 in 1986 after beating @entity121 in the final @entity114 captained the @entity63 team to victory at the @entity65 in 1986 held in @entity125 @entity114 ( second right ) infamously scored the @entity128 goal against @entity16 in 1986 forget our @entity29 angst about the @entity128 and all the scandals			2
remember the genius who also spirited a deeply indifferent @entity134 to their only @entity136 title			0
3 ) @entity137 revered as greater than @entity89 in @entity66 , where they worship above all pure , incredible magic on the ball			0
was the divine inspiration for two of his country ’s @entity65 triumphs , perhaps most notably in 1962 when he assume the mantle of leadership from the injured @entity89			0
@entity66 forward @entity137 ( left ) was held in higher regard by supporters than the iconic striker @entity89 @entity137 ( left ) takes on @entity16 player @entity150 while in action for @entity66 , where he was loved for his skill @entity137 ( left ) was renowned for his dribbling ability and inspired @entity66 to two @entity65 victories also the most loved of all @entity156 players , as a bohemian man of the people			1
4 ) @entity159 can be excused the absence of the @entity65 from his portfolio , as he played only six times for @entity63 before joining @entity163 , who had him naturalised in the vain hope that he might galvanise a poor @entity167 national team			2
@entity168 was one of only three stars who played in all @entity163 ’s winnings of the first five @entity172			0
striker @entity159 ( centre ) was described as one of the most complete players ever by @entity89 @entity176 ( right ) scores for @entity163 in the @entity179 final against @entity180 in the 1960 final @entity176 poses with five @entity179 trophies won during a trophy - laden era with @entity163 he ran the team from midfield , inspiring the dazzling moves which he then arrived in the box to turn into goals			2
at his greatest when @entity189 came from @entity190 to join him at the @entity191			0
do n’t just take my word for it			0
@entity89 and @entity195 are among many who describe @entity159 as ‘ the most complete footballer of all time			0
’ 5 ) @entity199 exempt from our @entity65 statute by virtue of playing for second - tier @entity204 , yet still did more for his country at @entity66 2014 than @entity0 for @entity63			1
@entity199 has fired in goals at a relentless rate during his career at @entity163 @entity199 ( right ) scores for @entity204 in the @entity211 game against @entity212 at @entity66 2014 @entity199 has a physicality that appears to emulate @entity0 when comparing the two best modern day players he , too , is blessed with little @entity216 ’s dexterity on the ball but also brings physical power and serious pace to the argument as to which of these @entity223 winning rivals should be the representative of the modern era occupying the final place this list .			1

@entity0 starred as @entity9 beat @entity1 on wednesday
*pundits* , managers and players have described him as the best player ever
but does his lack of international *success* with @entity63 hold him back ?
read : @entity0 was magnificent *...* even @entity238 was left *gasping*
@entity240 : i have never seen anything like @entity0
