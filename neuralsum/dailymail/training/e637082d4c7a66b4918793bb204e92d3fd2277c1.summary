novice surfers flocking to beauty spot @entity8 in @entity10 are being blasted for being ‘ ignorant ’ and not following ‘ basic surf etiquette ’			1
residents want first - time surfers to learn the sport before getting in the water @entity13 , 48 , was left with a six - inch head wound after being struck by a runaway surfboard at the beach mr @entity13 , 48 , who owns a café at the popular tourist beach , was left with a six - inch wound from the incident and had to have his head glued back together at hospital			1
he has now hit out at first - time surfers who flock to the region every summer to lap up the @entity10 waves			1
he said : ‘ there ’s a saying that if you do n’t surf in january , do n’t try to surf in july			0
‘ this guy just bailed before getting his wave			0
i do n’t know why - he might have thought the wave was too big			2
‘ but by just jumping off his board the way he did , he sent it flying straight at me			2
‘ i had no chance to get out of the way - he was only feet away - and it cracked me right on the top of my head			1
‘ it was unbelievably painful and when i put my hand up to feel the damage , i could see straight away that i was covered in blood			0
mr @entity13 , who owns a cafe at @entity8 , believes the board that hit him belonged to an inexperienced surfer thousands of tourists flock to @entity8 every year to make the most of the sandy beach and surfing conditions ‘ there ’s a basic rule , or code , that every surfer learns - you must try to keep control of your board			1
if he ’d just held on to his board he ’d have been ok and so would i. ‘ instead i ended up in @entity71 having to have my head glued back together			1
‘ actually it could have been worse - it might have caught me in the eye , or i could have lost some teeth			2
‘ fast - moving surfboards can pack quite a wallop			2
it ’s almost scalped me			0
’ the beach is popular with the likes of prime minister @entity6 , who holidays regularly there with his family , and prince @entity5 and @entity84 who were both spotted surfing at the seaside resort in 2012			1
residents now want visitors to undergo safety training before hitting the waves - to learn the equivalent of surfing ’s @entity91			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ i ’m 99 per cent sure that the guy was a holidaymaker who did n’t know what he was doing			2
‘ i know all of the locals			0
this guy did n’t even check to see if i was ok			0
@entity8 beach is popular with the likes of prime minister @entity6 who holidays there regularly mr @entity6 has previously spoken of his love for the beach and local beer , and often visits with his family ‘ i shouted at him and said “ you ’ve just whacked me ” and put my hand up to show him the blood			1
i caught the next wave in and was expecting him to follow to at least see how i was but he did n’t			0
‘ it ’s a bit like hitting someone with a car - you have a responsibility to stop and see if the other person is ok			2
‘ there are lots of ways to injure yourself while surfing but it ’s particularly galling when you injure somebody else			0
‘ it ’s more likely to happen when the sea is crowded and , at this time of year , the beach at @entity8 is pretty busy			1
‘ it ’s really important that people get themselves some basic training instead of just picking up the first board they see and rushing into the sea			0
’ his opinion was echoed by @entity133 , who runs a surf school at the sandy beach			0
he said : ‘ it ’s very important to learn the correct surfing etiquette			1
it ’s like a @entity91			0
‘ surfing is fantastic fun and nobody wants to take away the fun element , but getting a serious injury is no fun at all			2
the beach is also popular with the @entity146 and prince @entity5 who were spotted surfing there in 2012 prince @entity5 appeared to be enjoying the waves when he and friends took to their surfboards during a getaway the beach is a popular tourist spot and many people , including the royals , travel far and wide to visit the resort ‘ this accident was n’t the first and it wo n’t be the last			1
it ’s important that people have equipment which is appropriate to their level of skill and experience			0
‘ there are lots of ways to learn - it can be just with a friend who has got experience , it does n’t have to be with a surf school like ours			2
‘ but it ’s really not clever to grab hold of a board , rush straight into the ocean and treat it like a playground			0
that ’s just asking for trouble			0
’ the @entity181 , which has lifeguards patrolling the majority of @entity10 ’s beaches , said visitors are encouraged to undertake proper training before attempting surfing for the first time			1
its website says : ‘ to maximise your enjoyment and keep yourself and others safe when riding waves it ’s important to understand surf etiquette			0
‘ if you are unsure , ask a lifeguard to explain			0
