by @entity0 and @entity1 money man : @entity3 recently increased his ownership stake in the @entity5 and that helped push his net worth over $ 1billion basketball legend @entity3 has become the only current billionaire who shot to fame as a professional athlete			1
@entity11 estimates that @entity13 's equity as owner of the @entity15 's @entity5 is $ 416million and his net worth outside of the team to be $ 600million			1
it reported @entity3 now owns 89.5 per cent of the @entity5 , which marks an additional stake in the team since he previously owned just 80 per cent			1
@entity3 's spokeswoman , @entity21 , confirmed that @entity3 purchased an additional stake in the @entity5 in january 2013 , but would n't say how much			2
@entity21 had no comment on whether or not @entity13 is a billionaire			0
a six - time @entity15 champion with @entity26 , @entity3 earned fame and fortune on the basketball court , as well as through endorsements and movies			2
the 51 - year - old became the majority owner of the @entity5 ( formerly the @entity5 ) in 2010 when he bought out @entity35 's share of the team for $ 175million			0
it is that team , and not the various athletic gear or his infrequent film projects that have launched him into the realm of the extremely wealthy			0
a recent evaluation of the team predicted that the @entity5 are worth $ 410million , but @entity11 states that number may be low - balling it a bit considering the @entity45 , long considered the least valuable team in the @entity15 , sold for $ 550million last month			2
@entity48 slam dunk : @entity3 made a name for himself on the @entity26 in the 1990s @entity11 ' experts pits the @entity5 ' true value at somewhere between $ 600million and $ 625million , and once the money he has spent on the team is subtracted out from his portion of that estimate then coupled with his unrelated earnings of $ 600million , the total would put him just slightly above the billion - dollar mark			1
technically @entity13 is not the first professional athlete to reach billionaire status , but he is believed to be the only person to currently hold that title			0
@entity63 was named as the first sports star billionaire in 2009 but that came two months before news of his cheating scandal broke , which led to the loss of a number of his sponsors - and the billionaire label with it .			0

@entity3 owns 89.5 per cent of the @entity5 @entity15 team which is believed to be worth more than $ 600million
*combined* with his other earnings , that *hypothetical* profit margin would put him over the $ 1billion mark
