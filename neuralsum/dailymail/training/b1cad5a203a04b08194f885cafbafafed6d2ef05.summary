research suggests that taking the contraceptive pill makes women less competitive with each other , meaning they are less likely to fight to keep their ideal man			2
as researchers said women should be made aware that the @entity16 can have psychological , as well as physical , side - effects , other experts urged women not to throw away their supplies			1
the study by team of researchers in the @entity23 found the contraceptive pill can make women less competitive the team from the @entity27 , in the @entity23 , studied a group of young women when they were taking the @entity16 and when they came off it			1
on each occasion the volunteers , who were aged between 20 and 31 , filled in questionnaires designed to measure intra-sexual competition – or whether they viewed other women as friends or foes			2
they found that women in a relationship were less competitive when they were on the pill , making them less likely to fight to keep their partner if another woman comes along to turn his head			2
they believe this is because the oral contraceptive , taken by millions , suppresses testosterone , a hormone that fuels rivalry in both sexes			0
among single women , they believe the desire to meet a mate could override the hormonal influence of the @entity16			1
dr @entity54 , a fertility expert at @entity55 , said the ‘ intriguing ’ study warranted further research			0
but he added : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s sufficient evidence for doctors to start issuing a health warning to women			0
’ however some experts have questioned the study and said women should not throw away their supplies writing in the journal @entity67 , researcher @entity68 said : ‘ if hormonal contraceptive use reduces a natural propensity for partnered women to compete for mates it may mean that many women in our contemporary population , where hormonal contraceptive use is widespread , have a reduced ability to attract new mates or to maintain their existing partner			1
‘ in light of our findings , women using hormonal contraceptives may be at a disadvantage in that they are less likely to seek out or switch to a new partner from whom they might acquire additional benefits			0
‘ women who use hormonal contraceptives may settle and start families with partners who they otherwise would not			0
’ however , other experts questioned her interpretation of her results – and pointed out some highly competitive women like to take the pill because it frees them from pre-menstrual tension and other problems that can hold them back .			1
