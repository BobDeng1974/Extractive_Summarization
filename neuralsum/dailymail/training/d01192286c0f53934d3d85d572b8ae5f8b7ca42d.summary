it is much rarer than having a pair separated by a single baby			2
ms @entity8 , whose children now get through 140 nappies a week , said : ' we worked the odds out of more than 700,000 to one , just because it 's so rare to not have a " filler baby " between twins			1
' it 's obviously a record i never set out to achieve			0
i do feel blessed that my family feels absolutely complete at such a young age			2
' now we 've just got to get married			0

@entity8 and fiancé @entity15 the healthy new arrivals , who like their older siblings are non-identical twins , were born five minutes apart after a very short labour but the couple 's joy turned to shock when they had the 12 week scan and were told they were expecting two new arrivals			1
she said : ' the shock took forever to get over			0
@entity15 went white and his jaw hit the floor			2
' but now they 're finally here , i would n't change them for the world			0
' i mentally prepared myself for complete chaos at having four children under four , but luckily they are all very well - behaved - most of the time			2

' the family - of - six live in @entity9 , @entity10 , where mr @entity15 works as a warehouse manager			2

the couple were shocked when an ultrasound ( pictured right ) revealed they would be having a second consecutive set of twins ' @entity32 looks just like @entity15 and @entity30 looks just like me			1
' the midwife told us that since i 've already done it twice , we 've got a 50 per cent chance of having twins again			0
' i know there 's nothing wrong with us , we 're just probably a bit super fertile			0
' obviously when i fell pregnant at 17 we were n't using fertility treatment , and we definitely were n't this time around			2
' we 've decided no more after this			0
' mr @entity15 added : ' we 've got four girls in the family so @entity28 and i are slightly outnumbered these days			1
' but he is going to be a brilliant big brother to them all			0
' @entity126 , director for @entity127 at the @entity43 , said : ' i have been a midwife for over 30 years and have never seen someone at such a young age have two sets of twins in succession like this			1
' as a mother of twins myself i know what she is going through and i wish her all the best			0
ms @entity8 always wanted another baby - and was delighted when she realised in january she was pregnant again with @entity32 ( right ) and @entity30 ( left ) ' women having twins and multiple births are monitored closely throughout the pregnancy particularly when it is a teenage pregnancy			1
' the experience gained with her first set of twins was no doubt helpful when she gave birth second time round			2
' the family 's hectic routine is seeing her get through at least 20 nappies a day , and put on at least two loads of washing			0
she said : ' i have to follow a very structured daily routine otherwise i 'd never get anything done			0
' we are all up before 5:45am most mornings			0
' @entity29 and @entity28 play while i get myself ready and then i get all four of them washed and dressed which takes about an hour			2
' at 7am i prepare @entity29 and @entity28 's breakfast and while they are eating i feed the twins			1
' when everyone is finished i clean the kitchen and sterilise the bottles and put a wash on			0
' at 8:30am the oldest two are ready with coats , shoes , bags and packed lunches ready to go to nursery			0
' then i 'm home alone with the girls while @entity15 is at work			2
