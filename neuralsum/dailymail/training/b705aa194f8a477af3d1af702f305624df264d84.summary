' a typical sunrise shooting session starts about two hours before sunrise as i also like to do a few shots of the bridge among the stars			0
' i had to drive for 15 minutes and then hiked pretty fast to be up there as soon as possible			0
' while i drive , i can see whether there is fog or not and on a few previous occasions have returned back home because there was no fog			0
' on best - case scenarios like this one , the fog covers most of the bridge and the land , but only the poles of the bridge and highrises of the city are visible			1
' from day into night : at times , the 746ft structure across the @entity22 strait is barely visible mr @entity7 said : ' the fog in general moves pretty fast , and the level of visibility changed every minute ' he added : ' i was very excited to finally have the conditions that i was dreaming of and immediately started shooting with a wide angle lens			1
' i also tried having some foreground , free of the fog that could show the fog covering the scene like a blanket			0
' the fog in general moves pretty fast , and the level of visibility changed every minute			0
' this reminds me of a ghost moving fast through the bay			0
while most of the time some parts of the bridge and city was visible , sometimes everything was covered and invisible			2

the @entity11 is wreathed in the fog , with just the very top of the structure visible
the city itself appears to be *floating* among the clouds in the pictures , taken at sunrise
