' parents and families are less financially stable , frequently working two jobs or more , leaving little time to volunteer or take their children to extracurricular activities , ' she said			2
in hopes of stemming the decline , the @entity2 are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits			2
one is aimed at streamlining the process of joining the @entity2 ; another seeks to help volunteer troop leaders plan an entire year of meetings and activities with a single online visit			1
' these tools will dramatically decrease the amount of time a volunteer has to spend preparing so that they can spend it serving the girls , ' @entity40 said			2

@entity40 said there are about 30,000 girls on waiting lists nationwide			0
' the need for what @entity2 has to offer is not decreasing — more than ever girls need our time and our commitment , ' she said			0

' in hopes of stemming the decline , the @entity2 are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits last year , the @entity2 enlisted first lady @entity83 to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers			1

there was disgruntlement in some regional councils related to a deficit - strapped pension plan , as well as revenue shortfalls that prompted the national headquarters to trim about one - fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs			2
many alumnae — including some who were active as volunteers — complained publicly about the closure of some girl scout camps and what they perceived as a misguided shift away from camping and other traditional outdoor activities			0
@entity40 defended the changes , which included new programs seeking to boost girls ' competency with money matters and encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology			0
the @entity2 also have defended their decision to enter a business partnership with @entity124 , the manufacturer of @entity126 dolls			0
there 's now a @entity126 patch that girls can wear on their uniforms and a @entity132 doll			0
two consumer advocacy groups — the @entity133 and the @entity134 — have urged an end to the partnership , saying @entity126 is a flawed role model for little girls			0
if there 's a broad theme to the @entity2 ' current outreach efforts , it 's to depict its programs as invaluable in helping girls grow up to be leaders , particularly girls disadvantaged by poverty and racial or ethnic disparities			0
a breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members			0

some other youth organizations also have been losing members , for reasons including competition from youth sports leagues and a perception by some families that they are old - fashioned			2
the @entity178 lost 6 percent of its membership last year ; its youth membership has dropped from 3.3 million to about 2.5 million since 2002			1
the @entity178 alienated some conservatives last year by deciding to accept openly gay boys for the first time , while angering gay - rights supporters by maintaining a ban on gays serving as adult leaders by contrast , the @entity2 have long had inclusive membership policies , although there have been some defections by families who felt the organization had become too liberal			1
