a clock that is so accurate it will lose just one second in 16 billion years has been created by scientists			1
the device , made using super-cooled atoms held within a lattice of laser beams , is around 1,000 times more precise than the atomic clocks currently used to define time			1
researchers say clocks with this level of accuracy could open up new areas of science by allowing tiny changes fluctuations in the strength of gravity to be measured			2
scientists used laser beams to create a lattice that traps single atoms of super-cooled stontium ( above ) this is because time in a powerful gravitational field will move more slowly than in a weaker field - a gravity induced time dilation predicted by @entity29 's general theory of relativity			1
atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels			1
in an optical lattice clock , millions of strontium atoms are held in a column of laser optical traps			1
scientists detect the clock 's ' ticks ' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light			2
the precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels			2
by placing these hyper - accurate clocks at various depths around the world , it will be possible to measure tiny changes in the @entity54 's gravity			2
it could help geologists understand some of the processes that drive events like earthquakes and may even make it possible to predict them			2
dr @entity61 , head of the quantum metrology laboratory at the @entity63 for @entity64 in @entity65 , said the clock could also be used to develop a new international standard for the second			2
he said : ' if we can miniaturize this technology further , it would have useful applications , since tiny fluctuations in gravitational potential could be used to detect underground resources , underground spaces , and the movement of lava			0
' we also hope that in the future , this will accelerate the movement toward a new definition of the international second , based on optical lattice clocks , to an even more stringent standard than the current definition of the second			1
the lasers beams are used to create an egg - box lattice with each cup holding an atom of strontium ( above ) currently seconds are defined using @entity92 , which uses the oscillation of electrons within a cesium atom when it is cooled to almost absolute zero			2
as these electrons oscillate they emit microwaves each time and these can be measured			0
the best caesium atomic clocks are accurate to around one second in every 100 million years			1
however , dr @entity103 and his colleagues have created two optical lattice clocks using atoms of strontium that are held in a laser - generated egg - box shaped lattice			1
the new clocks could help to measure gravity induced time dilation as predicted by @entity29 ( above ) a single atom is held within each ' cup ' of the lattice within a container cooled to -180 degrees @entity118 by then measuring the frequency of light absorbed by millions of these atoms , scientists are then able to use this to monitor time			1
scientists have been trying to improve the accuracy of these clocks for years but until now it has been hard to produce any that out perform current atomic clocks			1
however , dr @entity103 has found that using laser of a specific wavelength and cooling the atoms can improve their accuracy			0
in a study published in the journal @entity137 , dr @entity103 and his colleagues compared two of these clocks over the period of a month to confirm their accuracy			0
according to the scientists , if their clocks had been running since the beginning of the universe around 13.8 billion years ago , they would have lost less than a second in time			1
dr @entity103 added : ' it was a great feeling to have shown this excellent agreement between the clocks			0
' the most accurate atomic clocks currently used are called fountain clocks - so called the cesium atoms are tossed in the air and fall back down inside a vertical tube during a key routine repeated thousands of times an hour			1
a gas of cesium atoms is introduced into the clock 's vacuum chamber and six infrared laser beams gently push about 10 million atoms into a ball			1
in this process , the lasers cool the atoms to temperatures near absolute zero and slow them down significantly , to enable precise measurements of their natural vibrations			0
two vertical laser beams produced by the six lasers are used to gently toss the atom balls upward through the flight chamber ( the " fountain " action ) , and then all of the lasers are turned off			1
this little push is just enough to loft the ball about 1.3 meters high through a microwave - filled cavity			0
gravity brings the ball back down through the microwave cavity			0
during the trip , some atomic states of the atoms are altered , while others remain the same , as they interact with a microwave signal from a maser			0
when the trip is finished , another laser is pointed at the atoms			0
some atoms — those whose energy states were altered by the microwave signal — emit light , or fluorescence			0
the resulting photons , the tiny packets of light emitted , are measured by a detector			0
this process is repeated while the microwave signal in the cavity is tuned to different frequencies			0
eventually , a microwave frequency is found that alters the states of most of the cesium atoms			0
this frequency is the natural resonance frequency of the cesium atom ( 9,192,631,770 hz ) , or the frequency used to define the second .			0

@entity65 researchers have created *super-accurate* optical lattice clocks
they are 1,000 times more precise than the most accurate atomic clocks
they are made using super-cooled atoms held in a lattice of laser beams
scientists say their clocks would have lost less than one second if they had running from the moment the universe was born with the @entity233
they say the devices could help understand and predict earthquakes
