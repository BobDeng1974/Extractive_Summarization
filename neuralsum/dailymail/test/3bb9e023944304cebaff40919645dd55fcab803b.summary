it is the biggest culinary question which divides the @entity1 : when eating a scone , do you add jam or cream first ? today @entity6 waded into the long - running dispute , and quickly got into a muddle about the @entity10 and @entity11 way of eating a cream tea			1
the prime minister made the gaffe on a campaign visit to @entity10 , before risking the wrath of purists by claiming ' it all tastes the same '			1
but his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of tea by the @entity41 on @entity42 in @entity43 , the @entity32 reported			2
all good politicians know how to make small talk with voters , but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter			1
in an attempt to woo the locals , mr @entity6 ventured : ' when you are in @entity10 you do the jam and the cream in a different order to @entity11 , is that right ? ' sensing a gaffe was imminent , he went on : ' i 'm going to get this wrong , are n't i ? ' his prediction was correct , as he added : ' in @entity10 it 's ... jam first and cream on top ? ' his comments were greeted with silence and stony faces , as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the prime minister right			1
i knew i 'd get it wrong , ' mr @entity6 said			0
' it all tastes the same , does n't it ? '			0
wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream , and whipped cream or clotted , have been running for generations , with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century			2
the @entity10 tradition is to slather the scone with cream first , while the @entity11 – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way			1
two years ago , an academic devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea , and it used the @entity11 way			2
dr @entity93 , of @entity94 , concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1 , which means an average scone , weighing 70g , requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream the @entity27 leader has spent the day campaigning in @entity10 , where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority academic dr @entity93 , of @entity94 , devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea , and it used the @entity11 way			1
dr @entity93 set the ideal thickness of the scone , with all its elements added , at about 2.8cm , allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite			0
the equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers			2
dr @entity93 's formula is a victory for @entity11 , with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge			0
another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream			0
this is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio			0
the thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone .			0

prime minister makes culinary blunder as he tries to woo @entity10 voters
chatting in a @entity43 cafe , he tried to guess jam or cream first
*cornish* use jam with cream on top , but *people* in @entity10 do it in reverse
