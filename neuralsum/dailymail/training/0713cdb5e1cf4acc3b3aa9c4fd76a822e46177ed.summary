next time you are confronted with a complex problem , do n’t worry - the answer could lie at the bottom of your garden			0
leaving your laptop at home , switching off the smartphone and taking a walk in nature can help boost brain power by as much as 50 per cent , a study has revealed			1
researchers found that adults performed much better in a creative test after spending four days in the great outdoors disconnected from modern technology			1
the great outdoors : researchers found that adults performed much better in a creative test after spending four days in the great outdoors disconnected from modern technology they say it is the first time that scientists have proven being in a park or woodland can improve your problem - solving skills			1
and it may also explain why a holiday helps recharge the batteries after busy periods of work			0
‘ the study shows that you need to leave the iphones and other technology at home and give your brain a break , ’ said co-author @entity34 , a professor of psychology at the @entity36			1
‘ too much of a good thing is not a good thing and so for creativity to flourish you need to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the natural world			0
’ adults in @entity50 spend an average if three - and - a - half hours in front of the small screen each day - around 15 per cent of their life			1
the population ’s increasingly sedentary lifestyle and vast use of tablet computers , televisions , smartphones , laptops and games consoles , has been linked to obesity problems and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes			0
for the novel study , published in the journal @entity70 , 54 @entity72 adults with an average age of 28 participated in a four to six day hike			2
no electronic devices were allowed			0
brain a break : co-author @entity34 says that for creativity to flourish , one must disconnect from technology before the trip commenced , 24 individuals were tested and scored an average 4.14 in a 10 - question creativity test			1
the remaining 32 were tested at the end of the walk and answered an average of 6.08 questions correctly - an improvement of 50 per cent			1
researchers said the results indicate that time spent walking in parks and woodlands away from demanding technology helps individuals to restore brain power			1
they say a hike provides an easy way to lift your creative abilities after long periods in front of a computer or tv screen			2
‘ we show that four days of immersion in nature and the corresponding disconnection from multimedia and technology , increases performance on a creativity , problem - solving task by a full 50 per cent , ’ said prof @entity34			1
‘ we are not sure if it is the increased exposure to nature or the decrease in exposure to attention demanding technology that helps , but it ’s probably a mixture of both			0
‘ in the real world , you are either in one or other state			0
when you head out into nature , you ’re unlikely to be surrounded by gadgets , while if you ’re at home or in the office the opposite is likely true			0
’ while earlier research has indicated nature has beneficial effects , ‘ it ’s equally plausible that it is not multitasking to wits ’ end that is associated with the benefits , ’ prof @entity34 said			0
he added : ‘ this is a way of showing that interacting with nature has real , measurable benefits to creative problem - solving that really had n’t been formally demonstrated before			2
‘ it provides a rationale for trying to understand what is a healthy way to interact in the world , and that burying yourself in front of a computer 24/7 may have costs that can be remediated by taking a hike in nature			0
’ mix of both : increased exposure to nature and disconnection from multimedia and technology improves problem - solving skills			2
