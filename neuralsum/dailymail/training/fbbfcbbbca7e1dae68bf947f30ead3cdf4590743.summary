@entity0 claimed that the @entity1 had endorsed his plans to reform @entity3 during the first presidential debate in @entity5 last night			1
but just a few hours later the senior citizens ' group spoke out to deny that it was supporting the president , and insisted that it did not wish to be drawn into the political horse - race			2
the rejection of his message came as another blow for mr @entity0 , who has been widely pilloried for his underwhelming performance in a debate which most commentators agreed was won by @entity17			0
under fire : @entity0 has been criticised for enlisting the support of the @entity1 during wednesday 's debate clash : the president criticised @entity17 's plans to reform @entity3 and introduce a voucher system the @entity26 challenger repeated a well - rehearsed argument that the president had cut $ 716billion from @entity3 in order to fund his own ' @entity31 ' health reform			1
in response , mr @entity0 denounced his opponent 's plan to replace part of @entity3 with a voucher programme for future retirees			2
' i do nâ€™t think vouchers are the right way to go , ' the president said			0
' and this is not only my opinion			0
' @entity1 thinks that the savings that we obtained from @entity3 bolster the system , lengthen the @entity3 trust fund by eight years			1
' greeting : but the candidates had harsh words for each other before this family get - together at the end minutes later , he made another reference to the powerful organisation which represents close to 40million elderly @entity54			0
' when you move to a voucher system , you are putting seniors at the mercy of insurance companies , ' mr @entity0 argued			0
' and over time , if traditional @entity3 has decayed or fallen apart , then they 're stuck			0
' and this is the reason why @entity1 has said that your plan would weaken @entity3 substantially			1
and that 's why they were supportive of the approach that we took			0
' but in a statement issued late on wednesday night , senior vice-president @entity66 rejected the link between the @entity1 and the president 's re-election campaign			2
jeered : mr @entity17 's running mate @entity71 received a hostile reception when he pledged to repeal @entity31 during the @entity1 convention in @entity74 last month ' while we respect the rights of each campaign to make its case to voters , @entity1 has never consented to the use of its name by any candidate or political campaign , ' he said			1
' @entity1 is a non-partisan organisation and we do not endorse political candidates nor co-ordinate with any candidate or political party			1
' the group drew controversy in 2009 when it publicly pledged support for mr @entity0 's signature healthcare reform , the @entity31			1
and its members entered the political fray once again last month when they booed mr @entity17 's running mate @entity71 after he promised to repeal @entity31 while addressing the @entity1 convention in @entity74			2
the elderly are considered a crucial voting bloc , as they are disproportionately likely to make it to the polls on november 6 and make up a large part of the population of key swing states such as @entity100 .			0
