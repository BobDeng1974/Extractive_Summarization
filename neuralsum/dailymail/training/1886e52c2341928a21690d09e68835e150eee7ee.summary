there may have been no @entity1 this weekend but there was still plenty of action from around the world			2
here , @entity7 's @entity6 gives you 10 things we learned from this weekend 's football ... 1			1
@entity14 ’s £ 10m deadline day signing of striker @entity15 rather went under the radar , what with all the fuss around @entity19 and @entity20			1
but the 22 - year - old might just turn out to be a significant replacement for the goals lost when @entity24 moved to @entity25			1
@entity15 scored 45 in 87 games for @entity27 – and showed he is in form with a strike that sealed @entity32 ’s shock 2 - 0 win over seven times @entity36 champions @entity34 as the @entity37 qualifiers began			2
@entity40 ’s @entity39 got the first goal			0
on target : new @entity14 signing @entity15 could prove a significant purchase for @entity14 this season 2			1
@entity45 looks like being the first managerial casualty of the @entity47 after @entity48 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity50			1
with no @entity52 the @entity51 managed a paltry four shots on target – and none of those caused @entity59 goalkeeper @entity58 , who plays his club football in @entity61 for @entity62 , the slightest bother			2
@entity45 , in charge of a dismal @entity65 campaign in which @entity48 failed to get through their group behind the @entity67 , got the full treatment from the crowd in the @entity71 stadium waving white hankies			1
@entity48 : without their captain @entity52 in the side , @entity48 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity50 3			1
@entity75 might be world champions , but @entity77 remain the star draw of the global game and proved it by setting an attendance record for “ soccer ” at the @entity82 in @entity83			1
some 73,429 packed into the home of the @entity85 to see @entity87 ’s goal secure a 1 - 0 win over @entity89 in a friendly			1
the growth of the game in the @entity92 , though , is underlined in it being only the fourth best attendance in @entity67 this year – the 109,318 who saw @entity95 play @entity96 in @entity97 is still the record			1
crowds : over 73,000 people turned up to watch @entity77 play @entity89 at the @entity82 in @entity83 4			2
@entity101 can now be considered @entity104 ’s number one goalkeeper after getting picked by @entity105 for the start of the campaign			1
the 27 - year - old son of @entity95 legend @entity109 had played only one competitive game in his previous five caps , but after @entity113 ’s promotion to the @entity1 he got the nod for the @entity116 qualifier against @entity117			1
he could n’t mark the occasion with a clean sheet – beaten from distance by @entity122 midfielder @entity121 – but at least finished on the winning side as the @entity124 fought back with goals from @entity126 and @entity127			2
@entity104 : @entity101 is now @entity104 ’s no 1 keeper after getting picked by @entity105 5			1
if @entity128 thinks he ’s got problems with the press , then its nothing compared to the goings on in @entity134			1
former @entity136 striker @entity135 had to leave the training camp to post bail for his elder brother @entity139 , who has been accused of leading an assault on a sports journalist			0
the reporter was chased out of the @entity143 after attempting to ask @entity135 in a press conference about rumours linking him to the disappearance of a musician			0
problems with the press : @entity135 had to post bail for his brother after his sibling was accused of chasing a sports journalist 6			2
@entity154 ’s ability to comb non-league football for players seems to have unearthed another gem for @entity158 in 22 - year - old striker @entity159			0
rejected by both @entity160 and @entity161 as a kid , he trailed around nine different part - time clubs before @entity154 spotted him scoring six goals in a dozen games for @entity166 , and signed him at @entity167 last january			0
it ’s taken @entity159 some time to come to terms with full - time football – but his goal when he came on as sub in the 3 - 1 win over @entity174 took him to five in six @entity176 games this term			2
problems : @entity128 's media problems are nothing in comparison to those of @entity135 in @entity134 7			1
@entity183 worked miracles when he saved @entity185 from almost certain relegation last season and continues to enhance his reputation this term			0
the 46 - year - old , who brought @entity191 back from non-league football in his previous job , watched two goals by summer signing @entity195 secure a win at @entity197 that put the @entity198 into the play - off places			0
@entity200 has been in charge of three basket - case clubs in a row at @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 where in each case he brought some brief stability during chaotic financial times			0
no wonder the 50 - year - old is enjoying a more stable environment at @entity213 where he has started to turn the club round after saving them from fears last season of a second successive relegation			0
goals from @entity219 and @entity220 brought a 2 - 0 win over @entity222 that put the @entity224 club into the @entity176 automatic promotion places			0
@entity213 : @entity200 has been in charge of three basket - case clubs before @entity213 9			0
fallen giants @entity227 are finding life tough in the @entity229 – and their first taste of non-league day ended in shame at @entity233 , not only because of the 2 - 0 defeat			0
the club are facing an @entity237 inquiry after one of their 565 travelling fans appeared to twice punch @entity233 striker @entity240 who had fallen into the back of the goal net			0
@entity233 was n’t the only place where fan trouble spoiled the fantastic efforts to promote non-league football , which brought good crowds to little grounds throughout the country			0
@entity251 ’s game at @entity252 in the @entity254 ’s @entity253 was held up for 20 minutes because fighting broke out among the visiting fans			0
@entity251 boss @entity257 had to make a personal plea for peace before the trouble ended – but then saw his team , who were 1 - 0 up at the time , go on to lose 2 - 1			2
@entity264 : fallen giants @entity227 lost 2 - 0 to @entity233 , but their fans also hit the headlines			0

@entity48 boss @entity45 could be heading for the exit after losing to @entity50 in @entity271 qualifier
@entity15 could be *perfect* @entity24 replacement at @entity14
@entity87 and @entity77 draw huge crowd in the @entity67 and set ' soccer ' record
@entity128 's media problems are nothing compared to @entity134 's
@entity113 goalkeeper @entity101 the new @entity124 no 1
