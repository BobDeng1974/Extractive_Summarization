a @entity1 woman has filed a discrimination lawsuit against @entity3 after the airline refused to allow her to fly on one of its planes because she is an @entity8 citizen			1
@entity9 , who moved to the @entity10 at the age of 11 and is now 26 , was barred from the flight at @entity13 because of a @entity3 policy that prevents @entity8 citizens from flying with the airline			1
the mother - of - four 's lawsuit has gained momentum in recent days after federal judge @entity19 ordered @entity22 attorney @entity10 general @entity20 and attorney general @entity23 to consider its merits			2
@entity3 ' policy of not allowing @entity8 citizens to fly on its planes has come under fire from an enraged mother - of - four from @entity22 mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity28 - who flies on a @entity10 passport - were due to fly to @entity30 on november 1			1
but the company policy meant she had to re-book with another flying operator while her husband went ahead			0
mr @entity28 told the @entity34 : ' i did n’t think a discrimination like this could exist in @entity10 , in @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , in @entity1			0
sixty years ago blacks were n’t allowed to ride buses			0
this is not about money			0
' his wife 's lawsuit claims the policy is reminiscent of the holocaust and the @entity47			0
lawyer @entity49 , representing the airline , claimed mrs @entity9 's claim was baseless because the company 's policy centred on citizenship , not religion , adding that a @entity55 with an @entity8 passport would not be allowed to fly			1
he likened the policy to the @entity10 embargo on its companies undertaking business dealings with @entity61			0
however , mrs @entity9 's lawsuit is not the first time @entity3 has come under fire for a policy many label as discriminatory			2
mrs @entity9 's husband @entity28 said he was astounded such ' discrimination ' could exist at @entity1 's @entity13 ( pictured ) a similar situation unfolded in september last year when a 32 - year - old @entity8 woman was denied her seat on a @entity3 plane to @entity30			1
at the time , lawyers for @entity3 said that the ban was required by the country 's law because it has no diplomatic relations with @entity8			2
they clarified that they were happy for @entity79 passengers to fly - just not @entity8 citizens , @entity77 reported			1
@entity3 have not commented on the lawsuit .			0
