by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 5 march 2013 publicity stunt : @entity3 ambassador @entity2 claims the poll will be ignored worldwide @entity3 yesterday dismissed the @entity6 referendum as an illegitimate ‘ publicity stunt ’			1
but @entity2 , @entity3 ’s ambassador to @entity9 , was criticised for her ‘ offensive ’ comments days before islanders hold their first vote on whether they want to remain @entity9			1
the historic referendum , which is being held this weekend , will be overseen by international observers			1
it is expected to send a clear message to @entity3 to keep its hands off			2
@entity9 has insisted that those living on the @entity6 – called @entity6 by @entity19 – have the right to decide which country they want to govern them			2
@entity9 triumphed when the two nations fought a ten - week war after @entity3 invaded the islands in 1982			1
miss @entity2 said : ‘ this referendum has no legal grounds			0
it ’s not approved , nor will it be recognised by the @entity29 or the international community , so this referendum is little more than a public relations exercise			0
‘ this referendum in no way changes the essence of the @entity6 question and its predictable result will not bring an end to the dispute			0
’ miss @entity2 also warned that @entity9 firms would find it difficult to drill for oil off the windswept @entity44 outcrop unless there were better ties to the rest of @entity48			2
but @entity49 , the @entity50 vice-chairman of the @entity51 , said : ‘ the @entity6 is part of the @entity9 and the population has wanted this opportunity to clarify their position			0
‘ they want to show the strength of feeling that they wish to stay linked to @entity9			0
it is neither right nor fair for @entity3 to keep claiming that the referendum is illegitimate			2
@entity3 would be quite offended if we interfered in their referendums or votes			0
’ @entity9 says the islanders have a right to self - determination , and insists they be present at any talks with @entity3 over the future of the islands , but @entity19 says the matter should only be discussed by two sovereign states			1
' the @entity3 government has already dismissed the referendum before it has even taken place , a position that runs counter to the universal principles of democracy and self - determination , ' a @entity9 @entity75 spokesman said			1
decisions : the inhabitants of the islands , 300 miles ( 480 km ) off the @entity3 coast are due to take part in a referendum on march 10 - 11 to find if they want to remain @entity9 @entity3 sees the @entity6 ' roughly 3,000 inhabitants as foreign implants and has compared them to @entity92 settlers on land @entity94 want for a future state			1
' we hope that the outcome of this referendum will demonstrate beyond doubt the views of the people of the @entity6 and whether or not they wish to remain a @entity102 , ' the @entity75 spokesman added			0
@entity3 has ramped up its claims to the islands , where oil exploration firms are expected to produce their first oil in 2017 , and last month @entity3 's foreign minister visited @entity108 but did not meet his @entity9 counterpart			1
a pro-british farm on the @entity112 referendum is widely expected to confirm the islanders ' wish for the remote territory to remain under @entity9 control @entity9 through and through : the capital of the @entity6 , @entity118 regional trading bloc @entity119 , which includes @entity3 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , has banned @entity6 - flagged ships from docking at their ports			1
' oil exploration is feasible , but oil exploitation is unfeasible ... imagine if a spill happens there in some remote islands 8,000 miles from here ... with no proper link to the continent , without doctors , logistics , engineers , ' @entity128 said			0
@entity3 hostility has not deterred oil companies			0
@entity140 has formed a $ 1 billion partnership with @entity142 to pump oil from its find north of the islands .			0
