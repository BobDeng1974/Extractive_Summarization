when moonlight the cat went missing almost nine years ago , his distraught owners tried everything to find him , before giving him up for dead six months later			1
but now the beloved pet has been reunited with owner @entity5 , 52 , after turning up at a vet 's surgery two miles away from her house in @entity9 , @entity10 , earlier this week			1
mrs @entity5 , who lives with husband @entity11 , and 17 - year - old daughter @entity12 , says the beloved animal is now back living with them and their other pets			1
moonlight initially disappeared while staying with mrs @entity5 's parents , @entity17 and @entity18 , in @entity19 , while mrs @entity5 was on holiday			2
@entity5 , 52 ( centre ) , and daughter @entity12 ( centre left ) were reunited with pet @entity24 after nine years when a member of the public brought him to vet @entity28 ( far right ) who found he was microchipped mrs @entity5 said @entity24 went missing nine years ago while she was on holiday , and the family gave him up for dead after a cat matching his description was found in the road , but he miraculously survived when she returned the family spent months looking for @entity24 , before a cat matching his description was found dead in the road			1
mrs @entity5 said the family were ' devastated ' at the loss , and even planted a special memorial tree for @entity24 in their back garden			1
however , unbeknownst to them , the pet was actually alive , and is believed to have survived wild on a nearby heath , hunting and killing his own food			2
believing he was a neighbour 's cat , a female animal - lover in the village occasionally fed @entity24 whenever he stopped by , but took him to the vet after noticing he had lost some fur			1
when the cat got there , medics discovered he had been microchipped , and were able to track down his owners			0
mrs @entity5 said : ' i simply could n’t believe it - it ’s just miraculous ! i was just so surprised , i really did not expect to ever get good old @entity64 back			2
' i was in shock at first but then i had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day			0
' the news was particularly exciting for @entity12 , who was just eight at the time the cat went missing , and was distraught over losing him			0
mrs @entity5 explained : ' there were buckets of tears			0
@entity12 was very distressed , even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic			0
' but rather than inform her daughter straight away , mrs @entity5 waited until @entity12 , who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday , returned from @entity81 college that evening to break the news			0
mrs @entity5 believes @entity64 was living wild on a nearby heath , eating whatever he could catch			1
a female animal - lover also fed him scraps , and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing @entity12 said : ' i was just really shocked			1
eight years is a really long time and so i was not expecting it at all - it ’s just so good to have our @entity24 back after all this time			1
' after a cautious reintroduction to @entity99 , the family ’s golden retriever , and two new pets , @entity97 the black labrador and @entity96 the cat , @entity24 is happier than ever			2
mrs @entity5 said : ' i was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us			2
' he obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog			0
' ' we always knew he was a good hunter , so if he was alive he would probably be ok looking after himself			0
' we think he must have been living wild on the heath near here , killing rabbits and mice , but also taking advantage of people who would feed him			0
' we are just so happy to have moonlight back - it ’s a genuine miracle			0
' @entity117 , who discovered @entity24 was microchipped , added : ' when a missing pet turns up , it ’s usually a matter of days , sometimes a little longer , but i ’ve never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years			1
' it ’s a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it ’s so absolutely vital to chip your pet			0
