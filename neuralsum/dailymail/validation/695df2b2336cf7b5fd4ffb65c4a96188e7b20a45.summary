@entity0 is pushing ahead with plans to complete building work on a new megacity in the desert			0
the @entity5 , or @entity5 ( pronounced ' cake ' ) , will be slightly larger than @entity7 and home to approximately two million residents			1
covering 70 square miles , the metropolis is costing £ 67 billion ( $ 100 billion ) and lies 100km from @entity11 , the commercial hub of the kingdom , near the @entity14			1
so far 15 per cent has been built , as public facilities and residential areas are still under construction			1
plans include a port , industrial complex , a financial island , beach facilities and residential neighbourhoods			0
@entity5 is one of four new cities being built to diversify an economy that is overly dependent on oil			1
already it has its own website showing plans , maps and including details on how to invest			0
@entity47 , the managing director of @entity48 , the publicly traded @entity0 company that runs the entire @entity5 project , told the @entity50 : only 15 per cent has been developed , as public facilities and residential areas are still under construction @entity5 has its own website showing plans for the city , including details on how to invest in its growth ' we 're building with the 65 per cent of the population who are under 30 in mind , ' he explains			1
' and we have almost 200,000 @entity0 studying abroad			0
inevitably they are going to change things when they come back			0
' given that more women than men graduate from university , it is likely the @entity0 landscape will shift over the coming years in more ways that one			0
cranes stand beside new high rise buildings under construction in the @entity74 financial district of @entity75 there are 90 km of roads in use in @entity5 but , under present deeply held religious beliefs prohibiting it , no women in the country are able to drive on them			1
the city 's future hinges on many things including the complex relationships between health , education , housing and employment requirements and infrastructure			2
it will also open up transport links around the kingdom and internationally			0
a group look at a model of the planned city which aims to create one of the world 's largest ports ' we aim to create one of the world 's largest ports , ' @entity101 , a young manager at the @entity74 port told the @entity50			2
' we 're not competing with @entity11 's @entity107 port - but we are going to take business away from @entity109 in @entity110			1
that 's because of our quicker , more automated offloading and customs procedure			2
' the late @entity74 had pinned his hopes for his country 's future on the innovative city as oil runs out ' freight arriving at the port will be taken directly to the capital via the new land bridge , ' he says , ' at the moment lots of products destined for @entity75 are shipped to @entity110 , but that will change			1
they 'll be shipped here as it is cheaper - and can be delivered more quickly within the @entity129			0
' @entity5 is also expected to become an important tourist stopover for pilgrims , aided by the fact @entity133 and @entity134 are on the high speed train network that links @entity5 with the two holy cities			2
at the moment @entity133 is one hour and twenty minutes drive away and @entity134 is three hours by car			0
