by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 27 august 2013 it 's always tricky coming up with an original fancy dress costume for the village fete			2
one family , however , appears to have gone with a current affairs theme - dressing up their children as accused drug mules @entity8 and @entity9			1
dressed in the same outfits , their hair in the same styles , stood with suitcases and holding a sign that says : ' the @entity16 2			1
drugs is for mugs ... ' the two young girls look like miniature versions of the girls who await their trial in @entity16			1
caused a stir : the photo of two young children dressed as the accused drug mules @entity8 and @entity9 has gone viral online the picture , which has been posted online , was taken at the weekend on the village green in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , about 20 miles south east of @entity32 , reportedly during the village summer festival			1
in the background parents and children surround a bouncy castle and other games			2
according to a local resident , there is a fancy dress competition every year at the fete ; it is not known if the children won or not , but there 's no doubting the resemblance they have to @entity8 , from @entity46 near @entity47 , and @entity9 , from @entity48 in @entity31 , who claim they were kidnapped and forced to unknowingly smuggle drugs from @entity16 to @entity51			1
the resident , who preferred not to be named , said he was ' appalled ' at seeing the picture of the two girls			1
he said : ' i 'm absolutely appalled			2
i 'm a parent and i have absolutely no idea whether the the drug mules in @entity16 are guilty or innocent			1
so to ride on the back of their notoriety like this is really sad			0
' the photo has received a flurry of comments on @entity64 , with reactions ranging from incredulous to comical and also support for raising awareness of the accused girls ' plight			1
many find the stunt funny , posting messages including : ' @entity72 , ' ' hahahaha , ' ' made my day , ' and ' ca n't help but find this hilarious			0
' another says : ' bit of a change from the normal fete costume			0
but shows solidarity for @entity16 drug girls			1
' others feel torn by the gesture ; one person says : ' this is n't appropriate , but rather funny			0
' another says : ' ca n't decide if this is funny , or wrong ... or both ' while some take offense to the political stand			0
' unbelievable , ' one @entity64 user writes , ' now i 'll be making my kids do funny stuff in the future but this is insane and very very wrong , ' says another			1
' why would you do that ? ! ? ' someone questions			0
@entity97 @entity9 ( @entity98 ) and @entity99 @entity8 ( r ) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to @entity103 , @entity51 , at the international airport @entity105 in @entity106 , near @entity107 , @entity16 up until now @entity108 , from @entity47 , and @entity9 , from @entity31 - but not close to the village fete - have insisted they are innocent			1
if found guilty , they could be sentenced to 15 years in prison			0
however , if they plead guilty , they may get off with only six years and eight months			0
on thursday the girls were moved to the @entity117 jail , which is surrounded by shanty towns just south of @entity107			2
the only @entity120 inmates , they will endure a military - style regime alongside 1,000 other female prisoners , including murderers and terrorists			0
@entity108 's father @entity108 told the media last week he wants his daughter to plead guilty , work with authorities and tell them everything she knows			0
' they were found to have drugs on them			2
they collected packages which transpired to be drugs			2
they are going to be guilty of that			0
' if that ’s the @entity16 law , regardless of the mitigating circumstances , then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you ’re trying to appeal and reduce			2
cuffed : the pair could spend up to three years in jail in @entity16 as they await their trial the father of @entity8 , right , has urged her to plead guilty to avoid up to 15 years in prison if found guilty in a trial			1
@entity9 , left , and @entity108 claim they were abducted by gun - toting @entity154 gangsters in @entity155 who threatened them and their families if they did not do as they were told ‘ these girls are young			1
they may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they ’re going to go free			0
if you ’re adamant that you ’re innocent , you do n’t believe that you ’re even going to be given a sentence , ' he said			0
the pair could spend up to three years in jail awaiting trial			1
