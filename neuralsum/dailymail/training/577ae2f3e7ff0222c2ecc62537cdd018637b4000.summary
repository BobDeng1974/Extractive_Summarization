new @entity1 president @entity0 launched an outspoken attack last night on @entity4 ’s obsession with protecting the @entity5 from @entity7 - inspired legislation			1
as @entity9 warned that the single currency is in ‘ extreme trouble ’ , the socialist victor suggested that @entity4 is ‘ indifferent to the fate of the euro area ’ and ‘ attentive only to the interests of the @entity5 ’			1
this is despite the fact that billions of pounds of @entity4 taxpayers ’ money is already being used to prop up the basket - case currency			1
he signalled his support for an @entity35 - wide transaction tax on financial deals and a fresh push for tax harmonisation – both of which are fiercely opposed by the @entity4 government			1
the combination of mr @entity0 ’s socialist demands for an end to austerity across @entity32 with political and economic turmoil in @entity47 pitched the continent back into crisis yesterday			1
panic selling sent shares and the euro into free fall in early trade before losses were clawed back in a late rally on a rollercoaster day across @entity32			2
the euro fell to a three - and - a - half year low of 80.44p against the pound and a three - month low of $ 1.2955 against the dollar before recovering			1
mr @entity21 and mr @entity0 put aside their differences as they walk past the @entity62 in @entity63 as part of the memorial celebrations today mr @entity21 touches his successor on the shoulder as they walk through the streets of @entity63			0
despite the closeness , their will be deep divisions in their view of @entity1 's economic policy shares around @entity32 were hammered in early trading before bouncing back as investors digested the news from @entity63 and @entity78			2
on a dramatic day across the eurozone , the @entity47 stock market plunged nearly seven per cent			2
but shares in @entity27 made small gains while @entity1 closed up nearly 2 per cent and @entity83 and @entity84 were more than 2.5 per cent higher			2
experts raised the prospect that @entity47 will fall out of the euro after 60 per cent of voters there backed parties opposed to austerity measures which have been demanded in exchange for massive bailouts by the international community			1
to make matters worse , mr @entity0 placed himself on a collision course with both @entity4 and @entity27			2
following his victory over @entity21 on sunday night , he boldly announced : ‘ austerity can no longer be inevitable ! ’ there 's work to do : @entity1 president @entity0 waves from the balcony of the @entity105 headquarters difference of opinion : mr @entity9 will make plain his frustration with the chaos in @entity32 today , as @entity109 , right , continues to insist that austerity measures must stay in place but yesterday @entity112 chancellor @entity109 made clear that her government will not renegotiate the terms of the eurozone ’s deal to save the single currency – which calls for austerity measures in exchange for bailout cash			1
‘ from our point of view , a new negotiation of the fiscal compact is not possible , ’ said mrs @entity109 ’s spokesman			0
her parliamentary party leader @entity126 added : ‘ @entity27 is not here to finance @entity1 election promises			1
’ mr @entity0 will make his first foreign visit as president to @entity131			0
but he will not see mr @entity9 until the end of next week at the @entity133 at @entity134			2
it is likely to be a tense affair			0
in an interview with the @entity1 - language version of the @entity140 website , he condemned @entity4 ’s approach to the euro crisis			1
mr @entity0 made clear he resents @entity4 remaining outside the single currency because the @entity144 – unlike the @entity145 – has been able to print money to keep the economy afloat			1
he said : ‘ in addition to relative indifference to the fate of the euro area , @entity4 is more protected because of speculation the central bank may intervene directly to finance the debt			1
’ ‘ @entity32 is not a cash box , let alone a cashpoint			0
’ mr @entity0 then went further by making clear that he would fight @entity4 over new @entity35 taxes			2
‘ the @entity4 have been particularly shy about the issues of financial regulation , and attentive only to the interests of the @entity5 – hence their reluctance to see the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and tax harmonisation in @entity32			2
’ the woman who opened the @entity168 refugee camp is the hot favourite to become @entity1 's next prime minister the @entity1 president also made clear he is at odds with mr @entity9 over austerity			1
while the @entity174 will insist in a speech later today that the @entity4 sticks to the same economic course , mr @entity0 is demanding more borrowing to stimulate the economy			1
‘ everyone admits that austerity alone can not return balance to the public accounts , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 offered just one olive branch , saying he would meet mr @entity9 for talks on defence and industrial co-operation			2
‘ i will meet @entity9 soon to discuss the benefits of further co-operation between our two countries on the industrial plan			2
we are committed to continued defence rapprochement			0
’ asked whether he speaks @entity192 , he replied : ‘ yes , but i am attached to the @entity1 language			2
i will defend the ubiquitous use of @entity1			0
’ the charge that the government is ‘ indifferent to the fate of the euro ’ comes despite mr @entity9 and chancellor @entity199 repeatedly saying that a stable euro is good for @entity4 , not least because 40 per cent of @entity4 ’s exports are to the euro area			1
what is more , @entity4 has poured more than £ 12billion into bailouts for bankrupt euro nations such as @entity206 and @entity207 , and £ 40billion in loans to the @entity209 to help pay for @entity47 ’s bailouts			1
despite mr @entity0 ’s ebullient tone , the greatest crisis last night was affecting @entity47 , where extremist parties are on the brink of power after mainstream parties who back the terms of the current bailouts failed to form a government			1
the prime minister will use a speech alongside @entity223 to point out that the chaos afflicting the single currency is dragging @entity4 ’s economy down as well			1
‘ i know that the task of driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one , ’ he will say			0
amid heightened tensions within the coalition following last week 's drubbing in the local elections , the prime minister and deputy prime minister will declare their determination to work together and do ' whatever needs doing to succeed '			1
the so - called renewal of their ' marriage vows ' marks the start of a crucial week for the government , with the announcement tomorrow in the @entity246 of the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session			0
in contrast to their initial appearance together two years ago in the @entity253 rose garden , mr @entity9 and mr @entity223 will set out their renewed commitment to work together against the more prosaic backdrop of a factory in @entity258			0
the tone too will be altogether more sombre , with the prime minister warning that the damage done in the financial crash of 2008 was ' greater than anyone thought ' , while mr @entity223 will liken it to a ' giant heart attack '			1
mr @entity9 will stress that their ' number - one priority ' was still to keep @entity4 safe from the financial storm raging in the eurozone and to rescue the economy from the ' mess ' left by the last @entity273 government			1
' that was and remains our guiding task and in these perilous times it 's more important than ever for @entity4 that we stick to it , ' he is expected to say			0
still together : prime minister @entity9 , right , and deputy prime minister , @entity223 , will renew their ' marriage vows ' two years after their first speech together in the @entity253 rose gardens in 2010 ' i do n't hide from the scale of that challenge - or from the message sent by voters in many places in last week 's elections			1
there are no closed minds , no closed doors in @entity253			0
' i know that the task of getting driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one			0
' but this government is determined to do whatever needs doing to succeed			0
' in his remarks , mr @entity223 will dismiss claims the coalition has an ' ideological obsession ' with shrinking the size of the state , arguing there was a ' clear moral responsibility ' to deal with the deficit and not leave it to future generations			0
' ducking the tough choices would only prolong the pain , condemning the next generation to decades of higher interest rates , poorer public services and fewer jobs , ' he is expected to say			0
' we are taking the tough choices not because we want to , but because we have to - any government would have to do the same			0
' at the same time he will emphasise the need to restore economic growth , calling for more to be done to get credit flowing to business and to lever private sector investment into major infrastructure projects			0
' two years in and building the new economy remains the coalition 's biggest challenge and while the deficit is part of that - it is only a means to an end , ' he will say			0
' this government is galvanised around growth			0
we owe it to the next generation to get it right			0
