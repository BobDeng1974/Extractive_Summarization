the @entity0 is reportedly so low on pilots that it is running its drone raids against @entity3 on emergency staffing levels while hundreds quit from being overworked			1
according to an internal memo from a top general , the extra strain on the military 's fleet of predator and @entity11 drones has pushed the air force beyond ' red line ' staffing levels thanks to @entity18 demands for more raids on @entity3			1
this in turn has caused fleet commanders to scoop up green recruits from flight school , which is now working at half capacity , according to a report in the @entity27			2
' not enough pilots ' : the @entity0 is reportedly creaking under demands for more raids by drone aircraft , such as the @entity32 pictured above in @entity33 fight against @entity3 : the increased demands are a consequences of the @entity37 's air campaign against militants in the @entity39			1
pictured is an explosion caused by air raids in @entity43 , on the @entity46 - @entity45 border flight school : training programs to teach cadets , like those shown here , the knowledge needed to fly drone raids are reportedly running at just half capacity according to @entity57 , the drought at the bottom comes as more experienced drone pilots quit due to the demands of flying constant raids against the enemies of the @entity37			1
pilots have reportedly had leave canceled and been forced to miss training courses which would normally lead to promotions in order paper over the cracks in the low staffing levels			0
the situation was revealed in a message reportedly from @entity71 , the head of @entity72 ( @entity72 )			0
' extremely concerned ' : the memo reportedly came from @entity71 , the head of @entity72 the message , to air force chief of staff gen. @entity75 , says @entity71 is ' extremely concerned ' by problems in the drone fleet , especially in light of @entity18 requests for even more operations			1
he said that the air force is expected to field 260 drones every day in 65 @entity83 ( @entity84 ) of four planes each			0
the @entity0 is supposed to have 10 pilots for each @entity83 , who would fly the craft , operate weapons and also gather and monitor intelligence - 650 overall			1
the message explained that in emergencies they can get by with 553 pilots per day ( 8.5 per @entity83 ) - but in reality they are running on no more than 520 pilots - a gap of 130			1
he wrote : ' @entity72 squadrons are currently executing steady - state , day - to - day operations ( 65 @entity83 ) at less than an 8:1 crew - to - @entity83 ratio			0
' this directly violates our red line for @entity105 [ remotely piloted aircraft ] manning and combat operations '			2
the memo also dealt with the wider consequences of the extra pressure , which has reportedly cleaned out flight schools ( @entity111 , or @entity112 ) and led to staff leaving			2
it said : ' long - term effects of this continued @entity116 [ pace of operations ] are manifested in declining retention among @entity120 [ drone ] pilots , @entity111 [ flight school ] manning at less than 50 per cent , and enterprise - wide pilot manning hovering at about 84 per cent			1
' an unnamed official told the @entity27 : ' it ’s at the breaking point , and has been for a long time			0
what ’s different now is that the band - aid fixes are no longer working			0
' an @entity0 spokesman told @entity130 it is ' mindful ' of how the demands of its drone raids are affecting staff , and admitted keeping the raids together is a ' challenge '			2
lieutenant colonel @entity138 said : ' in order to meet combatant commander requirements , and in response to @entity142 [ secretary of defense , @entity144 's ] direction , the @entity0 surged @entity83 nine times in the last eight years , and has successfully sustained those operations to date			0
' ' we 're mindful of the toll this has had on the force and recognize airmen remain the service 's most vital resource			0
' continued sustainment of surge operations will have potential long - term impacts on training , safety , retention , manning , sustainment , and combat capability			0
' ' retention problem ' : the memo says that more experienced pilots are leaving the force too			1
@entity165 is an image of a drone taken from @entity46 during the raids on @entity43			0

memo from @entity0 general says too few pilots can fly drone **missions**
@entity0 pilot school reportedly half full , current flight crews *overstretched*
general @entity178 told @entity18 it has *crossed* ' red line ' staff levels
@entity0 is supposed to have 10 pilots per four drones - is running on 8
@entity185 *implies* a *shortfall* of around 130 pilots across 65 **missions** per day
