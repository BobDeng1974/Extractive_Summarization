by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 5 april 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 5 april 2012 a massive wind farm that will become the third biggest in @entity3 was yesterday given the go - ahead by the @entity4			1
the @entity6 project on the @entity7 will have 103 giant turbines that could provide electricity for 175,000 homes – despite @entity7 only having a population of 22,000			1
the approval could also see the construction of a £ 500million cable to plug the islands into the @entity16 for the first time			0
an artist 's impression of the wind farm proposal and what the @entity21 will look like from the sky a map of the proposed site layout across the @entity7 however , opponents warned of an ' unimaginable ' impact on world - renowned landscape , with the £ 566million development set to dominate the moors and hills			1
the turbines will be up to 475ft tall – more than twice the height of the @entity35			1
the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) said rare species such as whimbrels and red throated divers could be at risk			0
in february , more than 300 people marched through @entity42 to protest at the plans , while 2,500 residents signed a petition opposing the project			0
but ministers gave the go - ahead , with the wind farm crucial to their election promise to generate 100 per cent of @entity3 ’s electricity needs through renewables by 2020			1
the wind farm is the 50th renewable energy project approved by ministers since may 2007			1
energy minister @entity56 claimed the construction work would create 140 jobs			0
a towering presence : the @entity21 in the @entity7 will boast 103 giant wind turbines like these on @entity62 wind farm near @entity63 he added : ' the development makes the case for an interconnector to connect @entity7 to the @entity16 , paving the way for more exports and renewable energy opportunities , including marine energy developments			1
' the development includes an extensive habitat management plan which will restore peatland and offer benefits to a whole range of species and habitats			0
' viking energy is an partnership between a company set up to represent the interests of the @entity7 community and power giant @entity3 and @entity85 ( @entity84 )			2
the publicly - owned charitable trust estimates the farm will provide an annual income of £ 20million to support community projects , and 34 permanent jobs			2
but conservation charity the @entity92 chief executive @entity91 said : ' the scale of impact on the world renowned natural landscape of these islands is unimaginable			2
' our objection included major concerns over the impacts on peatland and wildlife and there is little indication that these have been adequately addressed			0
restoration of peatlands is a cost - effective means of mitigating global warming – it makes little sense to be digging them up to build wind farms			0
' @entity115 , head of planning and development at @entity118 , said : ' the developers and ministers should have gone much further to ensure any negative consequences would be minimised			0
' @entity122 , chairman of @entity123 , an organisation set up in protest against the wind farm proposal , told @entity126 : ' there 's nothing ever been built to this scale , to this proximity in such a small landscape			1
you will never be able to escape this wind farm , there 's nowhere in @entity7 you will be able to go and not see it , unless you look out to sea and that will definitely affect tourism			2
' it will have a huge psychological effect on local folk , and people are bitter that the promised health impact assessment never materialised			0

wind farm will boast 103 giant turbines that could provide electricity for 175,000 homes
turbines will be up to 475ft tall - more than twice the height of the @entity35 in @entity153 and will *dwarf* the @entity151
but opponents say it will have an ' unimaginable ' impact on the @entity3 moors
