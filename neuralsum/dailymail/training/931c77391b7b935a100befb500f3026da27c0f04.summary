' 1995 - withdraws from @entity132 on sixth hole of his second round after injuring left wrist playing out of heavy rough 2002 - had his second knee surgery to drain fluid around his left @entity194 and remove a number of cysts 2007 - ruptured his acl running on a golf course , however , plays through the pain for the season 2008 - @entity202 surgery on his left knee after the masters in april 2008 - wins @entity132 in june , despite being told he had two stress fractures in his left tibia 2010 - neck problems down his right side forces him to withdraw from the @entity127 2010 - reveals he had a cortisone shot to help ease ' lingering soreness ' in his @entity215 in december 2011 - sustains a minor sprain to his left achilles playing from under the @entity124 tree at the masters 2011 - withdrew from the @entity127 for the second consecutive year after @entity215 , knee and calf problems 2012 - driven off the course on the 12th hole of march 's final round of the @entity23 at @entity80 after more pain in his left @entity215 2014 - @entity185 from the @entity66 with back problems the recovery time is listed as two to three months before that usually happens , which would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the meat of the summer programe			1
then there ’s the @entity237 at @entity238 in september			0
to play in that , he would almost certainly need a wild card and while captain @entity242 would be happy to hand him one if he has fully recovered , would a man who has undergone such an operation really want to be on a course in the heat of competition for as many as 12 hours a day ? whatever happens , this is unquestionably another massive blow for @entity126 , who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties			0
the most serious came in 2008 , when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out of action for eight months			0
he has also withdrawn from events owing to his achilles and a bad neck			0
in 2011 , he failed to tee it up at the @entity132 and the @entity139 because of an @entity215 complaint			0
it is all a far cry from 12 months ago when he returned to the top of the world rankings with an eighth career victory at @entity264 and third of the season			2
this was supposed to be the year when @entity2 got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back almost six years			1
now the future looks more uncertain than ever			0
