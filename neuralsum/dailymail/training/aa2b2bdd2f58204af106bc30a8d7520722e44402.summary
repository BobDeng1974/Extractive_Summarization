' it was a profoundly frightening experience which i never wish to repeat , and one in which i have learnt valuable lessons			2
' unfortunately , there was an error of judgement approximately seven hours after i stopped drinking			0
' i did not knowingly get behind the wheel of the vehicle drunk , nor would i ever do so			0
' the court heard how , after the crash , @entity7 drove over to the hard shoulder			1
he was then arrested following a roadside breath test which revealed he had 56 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath in his system			0
the legal limit of 35			1

mr @entity7 admitted being the driver of the vehicle at the time			1
' a roadside breath test was required of him due to the collision and it tested positive for the presence of alcohol			0

however , prior to that , he had a few glasses of wine and a few vodka cocktails at his father 's house in @entity23			1
' the defendant already had three penalty points on his licence after being convicted of using a mobile phone while driving in january 2013			0
sentencing him to a 12 - month disqualification , chair of magistrates @entity94 said : ' it 's clear that you are deeply in remorse and ashamed of what you have done , and to some extent surprised that the alcohol stayed in your body for that period of time			1
' it does show , however , that alcohol can affect the actions of a driver , and in this case you were lucky that neither yourself or any other road user was seriously injured in this matter			0
it could have been so much worse			0
' @entity7 agreed to take part in a drink - drive course which , if he completes successfully , will reduce his ban by three months			1
he was also fined £ 300 , and ordered to pay £ 85 in costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge			0
people are more cautious than ever about drink - driving - but most people are unaware that even three glasses of wine could mean you are over the limit the following morning			1
alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream from the stomach and the small intestine and is carried to the liver			0
among its many other jobs , the liver acts as a filter to remove poisons from the body			0
the liver produces chemicals called enzymes , which break the alcohol down into other chemicals			0
these , in turn , are broken down , until all that is left is carbon dioxide and water , which pass out of the body in urine			1
it takes about an hour for the body to process a unit of alcohol - but there are numerous factors which can affect this ( picture posed by model ) this generally takes about an hour for every unit of alcohol			2
to play it safe , it 's best to start counting from the time you finish drinking			2
for example , if you have 20 units of alcohol and stop drinking at midnight , it 's going to be 8pm the following day before it is out of your system			2
if you drink three 250 ml glasses of 14 per cent strength wine ( 10.5 units ) and call it a night at midnight , in theory it will be 10.30 the next morning before you are no longer under the influence			0
but this rate can vary depending on factors including weight , gender and medication in your system			0
liver disease expert dr @entity181 , head of population hepatology at the @entity184 , warns there is a range of complicating factors that can play havoc with the one - hour - per - unit calculation			2
he said it makes any attempt to work out when it might be safe to drive the following day a dangerous lottery			0
for a start , he says , blood alcohol is determined by your body fat distribution and weight : fatter people actually have less water content in their body			0
water in the body helps to dilute alcohol - hence the blood alcohol level would be more concentrated and higher in an overweight person than in a person of normal weight			2
women also have lower levels of a chemical called alcohol dehydrogenase - an enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the liver - so it takes a woman longer than a man to get the same amount of alcohol out of her bloodstream			2
medication can also complicate things			0
aspirin and birth control pills , for example , interfere with the liver 's ability to break down alcohol , slowing the process .			2
