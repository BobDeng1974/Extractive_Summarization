by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 11 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:42 est , 11 february 2014 the captain of a replica 18th - century ship that sank in @entity8 made a reckless decision to sail the @entity10 into the hurricane 's well - forecast path , the @entity3 reported monday			1
the three - masted wooden sailing ship sank about 125 miles southeast of @entity14 in october 2012 as @entity8 churned up the @entity16 seaboard			1
the newly released @entity3 report said captain @entity19 's ' reckless decision ' to sail into the storm subjected the aging vessel and its inexperienced crew to conditions they could n't surmount			1
one member of the @entity10 's 16 - person crew died and @entity19 was never found after the sinking off @entity28 's @entity27 , an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks			1
doomed : the shipwrecked @entity10 after it was sunk by @entity8 , a disaster which has been officially blamed on the captain in a report by the @entity3 all at sea : the newly released @entity3 report said captain @entity19 's ' reckless decision ' to sail into the storm subjected the aging vessel and its inexperienced crew to conditions they could n't surmount three other crew members aboard the vessel - built for the 1962 film @entity41 starring @entity43 - were seriously injured			1
' although this wooden ship was modelled after an 18th century vessel , the captain had access to 21st century hurricane modeling tools that predicted the path and severity of @entity8 , ' @entity3 chairman @entity44 said in a statement			1
' @entity10 's crew was put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation through decisions that by any measure did n't prioritize safety			0
' @entity8 was one of the most destructive storms in @entity60 history			0
although it had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone when it made landfall in @entity64 , its enormous size pushed a catastrophic storm surge toward much of the heavily populated @entity67			0
' put crew in put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation ' : captain @entity19 ( pictured ) was never found after the sinking off @entity28 's @entity27 , an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks in the path of destruction : the three - masted wooden sailing ship sank about 125 miles southeast of @entity14 in october 2012 as @entity8 churned up the @entity16 seaboard besides @entity41 , the ship was featured in several other films over the years , including one of the ' @entity81 ' movies			1
when not in use by moviemakers , the ship was a pierside attraction for visitors in ports and also served as an educational ship that taught people how to sail			0
the 108 - foot - long ship set sail from @entity92 , @entity93 , for @entity94 , @entity95 on october 25 , 2012 , a day after @entity8 reached hurricane strength			2
the plan was for the @entity10 to arrive in @entity94 for a november 10 event			0
but early in the morning of october 29 , 2012 , the ship sank after taking on more than 10 feet of water			2
crew members had to swim for their lives in the dark when the ship overturned			0
' it was an end to a voyage that should not have been attempted			0
to set sail into an approaching hurricane introduced needless risk , ' the @entity3 report says			0
struggle : a footage still shows one of the crew of the bounty being rescued from a life raft by the @entity117 after the vessel sank after the captain went against forecasters ' advice and sailed into the storm dramatic : an image taken inside the helicopter shows the moment crew members were saved from the ship during testimony last february at a @entity117 hearing in @entity130 , @entity131 , surviving crew members repeatedly said @entity19 believed a ship was safer at sea in a storm than in port			1
before sailing , @entity19 told nervous crew that his plan was to sail the @entity10 on a southeasterly course and let the hurricane pass southwest of it			2
but as the ship headed south , the path of the storm changed and began heading west			2
@entity19 , too , decided to head west - directly into @entity8 's path			1
' it is possible that the captain may have focused too narrowly on the position of the storm 's eye instead of on @entity8 's total expanse , ' said the @entity3 report , noting storm winds spanned more than 1,000 miles in diameter , and that the @entity10 was heading into an area already under tropical storm warnings			1
' still , the captain seemed to believe that he could outrace the storm , ' the @entity3 report added			2
it said @entity19 had hoped winds around the storm system would push the vessel southwest toward @entity95 , but that he and senior crew seemingly failed to anticipate the effect prolonged exposure to the storm would have on the wooden vessel			1
aging : the report also noted that while the @entity10 took on water even in good sailing conditions , the captain gave no order to ensure the ship 's pumps were fully working even though rough seas were expected @entity177 star : the ship was built for the 1962 film @entity41 starring @entity43 while the @entity3 report details numerous events leading to the sinking , it places the bulk of the blame on @entity185			1
among other things , it noted that while the @entity10 took on water even in good sailing conditions , he gave no order to ensure the ship 's pumps were fully working before leaving @entity93 even though rough seas were expected			1
some wood rot also had been recently discovered on the ship , the @entity3 said			2
the report also says the ship 's parent organization showed a lack of effective safety oversight			0
the @entity199 is facing a $ 70 million lawsuit in @entity201 , @entity202 , from the mother of deceased crewmember @entity204 , 42			0
the lawsuit claims negligence , saying the vessel was n't seaworthy and that @entity19 should n't have taken it out to sea			0
the @entity10 's former engineer , @entity210 , is also suing the @entity212 , @entity202 - based @entity10 organization and its owner for an unspecified amount			0
during the 2013 @entity117 hearing , the owner of the @entity10 , @entity216 , declined to testify by invoking his @entity219 right to be protected from incriminating himself			0
an email to @entity216 's attorneys was n't immediately returned late monday .			0
