they were the players brought in , invariably at great expense , carrying even greater hope of transforming the fortunes of their new club			2
a massive £ 760million was invested over two transfer windows , each addition going on to enjoy varying degrees of success , or otherwise			1
here , @entity10 runs you through our top 10 signings of the 2013 - 14 @entity15 season … here 's what you could have won , @entity17 fans			1
the @entity19 was all set for @entity21 until @entity22 intervened and took him to west @entity24 in a £ 32m deal			1
the energy and endeavour of the livewire midfielder is in stark contrast to those signings who wound up at @entity17			2
only @entity32 threatened to populate this list , but @entity34 just shades it for the final spot in our top 10			1
eyes on the prize : @entity34 almost signed for @entity17 while @entity41 is the only defender to make our top 10 the @entity43 is the only defender to make our top 10 but his performances on the south coast this season make him a worthy resident			1
an £ 8.5m arrival from @entity49 , he is both classy and composed but with no shortage of steel and has been one of the key components in @entity55 's success this season			1
yes , the @entity57 has fallen away in the second half of the season – his last league goal came on january 12 – but his impact in the early months of the campaign was sensational and he has scored 23 goals since his £ 20m arrival from @entity65			1
in the absence of @entity67 he kept @entity69 's goal return ticking over and his physicality has brought a new dimension to @entity69 's forward line			0
fallen away : but @entity73 , pictured here ahead of @entity69 's win over @entity75 , has scored 23 times before his £ 13m move to @entity78 , the majority of football fans outside of @entity81 did not know their @entity82 from their @entity84			1
but this @entity85 has certainly made a name for himself this season			0
boasting brains as well as bite , the @entity89 midfielder is very quickly becoming a terrace favourite with the @entity93 and @entity95 's decision to bring @entity96 with him to @entity97 has proved inspired			1
doing the business : @entity99 ( left ) and @entity96 in action for @entity22 and @entity93 respectively at £ 21m , the @entity102 's return to @entity103 came at a hefty cost			1
@entity99 , though , could prove a snip			1
he has added steel and composure to a @entity22 midfield in desperate need of an anchoring presence in recent seasons			0
@entity99 has done nothing but impress since january and the best is arguably still to come			1
without the loanee 's goals @entity113 may well have found themselves dragged in to a scrap at the bottom of the table			0
the @entity119 forward has plundered 14 times and will surely start next season playing @entity123 football , as is his wish			0
@entity125 is certainly deserving of the continent 's biggest stage on the evidence of this season			0
in black and white : @entity125 is set for @entity123 football next term after impressing on loan players prised from the @entity134 league have not always enjoyed a smooth transition into the @entity137 game			0
@entity138 , though , has proved a resounding success ; his 24 goals bear testimony to that			0
alert , agile and with a killer instinct , the 25 - year - old @entity143 is deserving of his place in our top five			1
initially a loan signing before making permanent his stay in january , the journeyman midfielder has arguably made the difference in @entity154 's survival bid			0
indeed , his seven goals in 2014 have all added points to the tally which sees the @entity154 well clear of danger entering the final game			0
@entity160 has even been suggested as a wildcard pick for @entity164 's @entity163 squad , such has been his form in the second half of the season			0
making an impact : @entity160 and @entity138 have starred for @entity154 and @entity169 in 2013/14 a loan signing , yes , but shrewd nonetheless			0
the @entity172 's goals – 14 of his 17 coming in the league – took @entity93 mightily close to a @entity123 finish			0
still just 20 years old , @entity175 has amplified his reputation as one of the game 's most promising talents and that is before he leads the line for @entity182 at this summer 's @entity163			0
on the evidence of this season in the blue of @entity93 , it would be staggering were he not given a chance in the blue of @entity22 next term , especially when their frontmen have all failed to outscore their club - mate			1
on target : @entity175 , on loan from @entity22 , has scored 17 goals this term the £ 30m capture of the @entity19 anchorman last summer was not met with too much fanfare			2
it was an under - the - radar signing and so , we assumed , @entity201 was an understated type happy to go about his business with minimum fuss			2
the 29 - year - old , however , has proved so much more , adding craft , graft and even goals to the @entity69 engine room			2
he has been a real class act but , the factor which sees him elevated to the summit of our list , is his consistency			2
the former @entity218 man has been a dependable presence at the heart of a side which looks destined to finish the season as champions			0
key man : @entity201 ( right ) has starred for @entity69 this season since his £ 30million summer arrival			2

a huge £ 760m was spent by top - *flight* clubs over the two transfer windows
