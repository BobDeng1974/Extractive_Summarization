former president @entity0 returned to @entity1 on monday to boost his party 's sluggish fortunes and urge voters not to tie liberal politicians too closely to their unpopular fellow @entity6 in the @entity7 with an angry ' protest vote ' in november			1
@entity0 , a five - term @entity1 governor before he won the presidency in 1992 , said in the town of @entity11 he has become ' sick and tired of people trying to stir people up , make them foam at the mouth and vote for what they 're against instead of what they are for			1
' ' how many times have we seen people do something they knew better than to do just ' cause they were in a snit ? ' he asked while he stumped for @entity30 sen. @entity29			2
@entity0 doubled down on tuesday , telling a university crowd in @entity32 , @entity1 to put ' resentment ' aside and support @entity30 even if they 're disappointed in president @entity34			1
@entity0 's homecoming : former president @entity0 ( right ) embraces sen. @entity29 ( left ) as he trails in a tough re-election fight , even though president @entity34 has been kept at arms ' length no coattails : the unpopular @entity34 has kept a low profile in midterm campaigns , as his tanking numbers have forced him into a background fundraising role that keeps the media on the sidelines ' why are all these people trying to get you to cast resentment votes ? ' he asked a young audience			1
' you ’re too young			0
you should be voting for what you ’re for			0
... you should be voting for your dreams			0
' republicans , he in both speeches , are busy connecting political dots between @entity34 and @entity30 @entity59 candidates			1
@entity0 has good reason to worry about that : the @entity62 needs to pick up just six seats to regain control of the @entity59 and control both houses of @entity66			1
most polls show that goal is within reach			0
@entity34 's coat - tails went from long to short as his @entity71 played out across kitchen tables , and have all but disappeared with his handling of foreign @entity75 terror groups and a relentless stream of domestic scandals			2
and @entity29 himself is n't doing @entity34 any favors : like most @entity30 @entity59 candidates , he has kept the president at arm 's length throughout his campaign			1
the president has found himself relegated to the role of private fundraiser , appearing at 56 high - dollar events that benefit @entity30 @entity59 candidates even as few of them want to be seen with @entity34 in public			1
@entity91 still hold a grudge against the president from his thrashing of native daughter @entity95 in the 2008 @entity30 primary			1
and ' the other thing , ' he said august 2 , ' is if you look at the president 's policies , he just does n't offer a lot to states like @entity1			1
he does n't offer a lot to rural @entity105			0
' it 's not uncommon for second - term presidents to drag their parties down during a midterm congressional election			0
@entity0 pushed back against that possibility on tuesday , blaming college - age voters for sitting out elections when there 's no presidential contest			0
' the reason this keeps happening , ' he said , ' is you do n’t show up in midterms ! ' he insisted that off - year midterms are ' every bit as important to your future as elections when there is a presidential candidate on the ballot			0
' but his larger theme was castigating republicans for generating anger against @entity34 , saying monday that ' they want you to make this a protest vote			1
' ' they ’re saying , " you may like these guys , but hey , you know what you got ta do , you got ta vote against the president			2
after all , it ’s your last shot			0
" it ’s a pretty good scam , is n't it ? ' no ' protest ' votes : @entity0 tried out a last - ditch strategy to encourage @entity30 to vote in november even if they 're disillusioned by an underperforming @entity34 presidency still packing them in : @entity0 draws large crowds in the state where he was governor beginning in 1978 at the young age of 32 ' the @entity147 , ' blared bold letters on the screen , was ' the worst economic record of any president in the last 50 years			1
nothing could be more frightening than four more years			0
' @entity153 won 17 per cent of the vote , due in part to @entity0 capitalizing on @entity157 's flagging popularity			2
but in his post-presidency dotage , and with @entity34 's own approval rating approaching gloomy @entity161 - like numbers , @entity0 has found the religion of positivism			1
that might not be enough to keep @entity29 in office			0
the @entity167 average of polls puts his opponent , @entity62 @entity169 , in the lead by nearly 4 percentage points			2
' @entity172 ' : sen. @entity29 has more than president @entity34 's shrinking coattails to worry about , judging from his incoherent answer to questions about the @entity7 's handling of the @entity180 crisis and @entity29 attracted national attention of the worst kind on monday when he offered incoherent answers to questions about the @entity7 's response to the re-emergence of the ebola virus			2
asked during an @entity189 interview whether the @entity34 administration ' has done an appropriate job handling the @entity180 crisis , ' @entity29 let out a long ' @entity192 ' and looked like a deer caught in headlights			2
' i would say that – it ’s , uh , it ’s hard to know , uh , because , uh , i have n’t heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details , ' the senator said			0
' i mean , i read the paper and all , but my impression is that we have people over there , both from @entity208 and other medical - type people and even some engineers , to try to build , um , you know , medical facilities			0
' @entity29 later released a statement admitting that in the past , ' i have given better answers to tougher questions			0

former president was in @entity1 to stump for @entity30 caught in the path of a *potential* @entity62 *landslide*
he blamed the @entity62 for running ' a pretty good scam ' by tying @entity30 pols to the president and his flagging approval numbers
urged a crown of @entity91 to vote ' for what you are for , not for what you are against '
@entity34 has n't appeared in public with many @entity30 @entity59 candidates , but he has headline 56 private fundraisers that benefit them
