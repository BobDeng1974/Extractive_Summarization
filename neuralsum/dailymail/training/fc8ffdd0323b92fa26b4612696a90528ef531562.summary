stamp duty is a ‘ middle class postcode tax ’ which forces children to squat in their parents ’ homes like ‘ overgrown cuckoos ’ , @entity1 @entity0 said			1
they demanded that @entity8 scrap the duty on homes worth less than £ 500,000 , saying it ‘ clobbers ’ ordinary families and young first - time buyers			1
@entity15 , conservative mp for @entity16 , said stamp duty ‘ discriminates ’ against the @entity22 and is a ‘ burdensome tax affecting that most @entity18 of ideals – home ownership ’			1
soaring house prices are pushing more and more people into paying higher rates of stamp duty she claimed ministers ’ failure to act has led her to question whether the current @entity1 leadership still shares @entity31 ’s dream of a property - owning democracy			1
@entity33 , @entity1 mp for @entity34 and @entity35 , described stamp duty as a ‘ vindictive stealth tax on aspirational @entity18 ’ and an ‘ assault by the taxman on hard - working , middle - income savers ’			1
but treasury minister @entity40 rejected calls for reform , saying the duty raises almost £ 10billion a year and ‘ we need the money ’			2
stamp duty is paid when people buy a home , and is charged at differing rates depending on the value of the property			2
it amounts to 1 per cent on homes worth between £ 125,001 and £ 250,000 and 3 per cent on properties up to £ 500,000			1
homes worth £ 500,001 or more are taxed at 4 per cent , while 5 per cent is charged on those worth more than £ 1million and 7 per cent on £ 2million - plus properties			2
treasury minister @entity40 said raising the stamp duty threshold to £ 500,000 would cost more than £ 4billion critics say the system is unfair because the thresholds between the bands have not changed for years , despite soaring house prices , meaning bands designed for the very well - off have now dragged in people on modest incomes			1
opponents also say the system distorts the housing market , and deem it unfair that buyers pay tax on the full value of the property , not just on the amount above the threshold			2
opening a @entity78 debate on stamp duty , mrs @entity15 said scrapping the levy on all homes worth less than £ 500,000 would fuel economic growth and increase home ownership			1
she claimed that any fall in treasury receipts would be affordable , as long as the government stops wasting money on projects such as the @entity88 ’ free school meals policy			0
‘ i ’m concerned that by allowing so many people to be sucked into paying ever higher rates of tax , despite earnings either rising modestly – or indeed earnings that have been frozen , such as in the public sector – we are actually denying our families of the future the chance to own their own home , ’ she said			0
‘ in 1980 , we believed in encouraging families of all levels of income to own their own home and i hope we have n’t moved away from that ideal			0
’ she said that in her constituency , 87 per cent of homes are now subject to stamp duty			1
‘ taxes that i believe were originally designed for the wealthy home buyer now bring in so much money to the @entity111 that i think it ’s being seen as an untouchable cash cow , ’ she added			0
‘ collection of stamp duty in its current forms is discriminatory , unfairly targeting certain areas of the country regardless of ability to pay and that can not be fair			2
‘ it ’s the ordinary families being clobbered the most by this tax			0
’ she gave the example of low - paid public sector workers , noting that ‘ they have a mountain to climb ’ in saving for their own property			0
mrs @entity15 said they faced either paying high rents – particularly in the @entity22 – or alternatively may be ‘ squatting like overgrown cuckoos in their parents ’ home ’			0
‘ in some postcodes , hardly anyone pays any tax to the chancellor , not even 1 per cent on a modest three - bedroom semi-detached house , ’ she said			2
‘ in other areas , such as mine , the same house has a huge 3 per cent tax bill attached to it			0
’ mr @entity33 said that in 2000 , there were 391,000 homes exempt from stamp duty , but the number has halved due to house price inflation			1
‘ it is not just the uber - wealthy ... who are paying the burden , it is middle @entity153 , the middle classes , ’ he said			0
home ownership now stands at its lowest level since 1988			0
only around 64 per cent of people own their own homes , down from 69 per cent in 2001			0
treasury minister @entity40 said raising the stamp duty threshold to £ 500,000 could result in tax revenues falling by £ 4.2billion			1
‘ in 2013/14 , [ stamp duty ] raised £ 9.3billion			1
that is a substantial sum ... and it is money that , frankly , we need , ’ he said .			0

@entity1 *mps* call on ministers to raise the 3 ***%*** stamp duty threshold to £ 500,000
stamp duty is levied at 3 ***%*** on homes bought for more than £ 250,000
houses bought for between £ 125,001 and £ 250,000 hit with 1 ***%*** duty
