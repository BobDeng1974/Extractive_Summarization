barely a day goes by without a new claim for the miraculous beauty benefits of virgin coconut oil			1
‘ virgin ’ means it is made from the first pressing of fresh , raw coconut with no chemicals added			1
if you believe the hype , almost every product in your bathroom cabinet could be replaced with the stuff			1
think of the savings ! @entity13 and @entity14 apparently wash out their mouths with it , and supermodel @entity18 says she uses it on her skin after being in the sun. @entity22 is said to eat it for breakfast and fellow actress @entity25 rubs it into the ends of her hair			1
solid and waxy - looking in the jar , it melts to an oil as soon as you handle it and is said to leave skin butter - soft			1
the lauric acid in it is credited with antibacterial , antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties , hence its popularity as an oral rinse			2
yet despite the surge in demand for coconut oil ( sales up 442 per cent at @entity61 ’s last year ) , there is little scientific data on its health benefits			1
so are we right to be nuts about it ? i decided to put the beauty claims to the test			1
i would have my hair , mouth and skin analysed by experts , then replace my usual beauty products for a month with @entity75 , £ 5.99 for 283ml jar at @entity77			1
@entity80 @entity75 , £ 5.99 for 283ml jar at @entity77 method : i put a penny - sized blob on two cotton wool pads and use it to remove eye - make up at night			2
celebrity make - up artist @entity85 says : ‘ i ’m already a fan of coconut oil			1
it ’s great for getting make - up off — particularly waterproof eye make - up			2
’ results : @entity85 says the coconut oil is working well for me			1
‘ it ’s thick and can clog pores , so the trick is to use as little as possible			2
a tiny spot of coconut oil will lift off quite a lot of eye make - up			1
it lifts off make - up more easily than my usual oily make - up remover and leaves the area around my eyes feeling nicely moisturised , too			2
@entity104 , @entity105 method : i find most hair conditioners make my thin hair look greasy , so i stick to using it on the dry ends			2
i follow the same routine with the coconut oil			1
dr @entity113 , a clinical dermatologist and expert in hair loss at @entity116 in @entity117 , says : ‘ @entity118 may well prove useful in smoothing the hair shaft and improving texture , but it ca n’t create hair roots or halt hair loss caused by , say , hormones			2
so i ’m sceptical that it will make your hair feel thicker			2
‘ your hair is in very good condition and your pull test [ a light pull which , in healthy hair , should cause no more than five hairs to come out ] is within normal range			1
’ results : dr @entity113 says : ‘ you do n’t have additional hair growth — i did n’t think you would — but the existing hair has been maintained in excellent condition even though you have n’t cut it			0
‘ after a month i would typically expect to see more hair breakage than this , so coconut oil has definitely been a good conditioner for your hair			1
’ @entity99 ? not entirely			0
i ’ll be keeping my usual conditioner because i usually blow - dry my hair after washing and the oil does n’t work well with heat			1
as i discover the hard way , heat breaks down the oil and creates an extremely unpleasant smell			1
but i ’ll keep using the oil as an occasional leave - in conditioner at night			1
@entity154 method : apply some coconut oil to a cotton bud or clean mascara wand , then gently smooth from the base of the lashes to the tips			1
this is best done at night after you ’ve taken your make - up off , as mascara does n’t sit well on top of coconut oil			1
dr @entity113 says : ‘ as with your hair , the coconut oil can not produce more eyelashes than you already have			1
i ’m not convinced we ’ll see much of a difference here			0
’ results : dr @entity113 says : ‘ i ca n’t see any change			0
possibly it would help if your eyelashes were very brittle , but yours were n’t in bad condition in the first place			0
’ @entity99 ? as i ’m still not very adept at getting the right amount of oil on the cotton wool pad when i ’m using it as make - up remover , a lot of it gets on my lashes anyway , so i might do this accidentally — but i do n’t hold out any hope that it will make them lusher or longer			1
@entity190 there was a noticeable in the condition of @entity194 's feet after using the coconut oil ( picture posed by a model ) method : i run a lot so my feet are a mess			1
i ’ve got one black toenail and swollen toe , peeling skin on the end of all my toes and cracking under my heels			0
my routine for the month will be to melt a bit of coconut oil in my hand and rub it into the foot , especially the dry and cracked area			1
i ’ll then wrap my feet in clingfilm and , ideally , leave the oil on overnight			2
i ’ve been advised not to wear socks , as the oil will sink into them instead of the skin			2
the routine must be repeated every couple of nights for mild dryness and every night for more severe cracking			0
@entity225 , of @entity226 , says : ‘ it may well be a good moisturiser and could also improve the peeling skin on your toes			0
as to whether it helps that black toenail , i ’ll be interested to see			0
‘ do n’t use it between your toes , though , as it could encourage fungal infection			0
’ results : mr @entity225 says : ‘ i ’m really very impressed			0
there is a marked difference in the quality of skin on your feet , and that damaged toenail — which i would expect to take months to heal — has got a lot better in four weeks			0
i will definitely be recommending this in future			0
i ’m really delighted with my prettier feet			0
@entity247 method : the technique is called ‘ oil pulling ’ and involves swishing a tablespoon of oil around the mouth for around 20 minutes each day before you spit it out			2
this is said to reduce plaque and bacteria , and so helps to fight gum disease			0
cosmetic dentist dr @entity259 , from the @entity260 for @entity261 , says : ‘ like many people , you have mild gum disease which makes your gums red and swollen in places and will make them bleed more easily			0
‘ most tooth loss in adults is caused by gum disease , so it ’s important to get on top of it			0
if oil pulling helps , great			2
’ results : ‘ in your case it has n’t made any difference , i ’m afraid			0
i ’m not against the oil pulling but would advise my patients to use it alongside three - monthly visits to the dental hygienist			2
’ @entity99 ? no. it made no difference , oil pulling feels cloying and the taste of coconut is overpowering			1
i ’ll go to see my hygienist instead			0
youthful skin is there any benefit to using coconut oil for more youthful skin or a brighter smile ? ( picture posed by a model ) method : as the coconut oil gives quite a shiny finish , i used it at night with a tiny top - up in the morning , if needed			1
dr @entity300 , a @entity301 cosmetic dermatalogist , tells me my skin is prone to redness , flushing and the appearance of broken blood vessels			0
‘ i ’d be very wary of using something as heavy as coconut oil , ’ she tells me			1
‘ it has a high comedogenic rating ( tendency to block pores ) and for someone with quite reactive skin , i predict it may well cause break - outs and irritation			0
’ results : since using the coconut oil i have been suffering from patches of irritated skin and pimples in the folds between my nose and the corners of my mouth			1
dr @entity300 says : ‘ this is almost certainly caused by the change in your beauty routine			2
someone with your fair skin type also needs to use a high @entity333 every day , and a sunscreen wo n’t sit well on top of coconut oil			1
’ @entity99 ? no way			0
my skin looks red and splotchy			0
it ’s oily on my forehead , dry around my mouth			0
where ’s my moisturiser ? white teeth method : mix two tablespoons of baking soda with two tablespoons of coconut oil to make a smooth paste			1
add a drop or two of peppermint oil to make it taste a bit more like toothpaste			2
dr @entity259 says : ‘ home - made toothpaste does n’t contain fluoride , which helps to prevent cavities and strengthen your enamel			0
bicarbonate of soda is abrasive and can damage enamel			0
’ he is sceptical that it will have any whitening properties			0
results : i ditched this after five days			0
your mouth feels slimy and dirty , your breath does n’t smell fresh and bicarb of soda feels too abrasive			0
my teeth are no whiter			0

it 's a firm favourite with celebrities like @entity13 and @entity14
but are there any real benefits to using coconut oil as a beauty remedy ?
