@entity1 , who already owns several million square feet of prime @entity10 real estate , as well as buildings across the @entity12 , has hinted that he 's interested in the vast building on @entity14			2
the billionnaire has just completed drawing up a long - term lease for the city 's @entity17 , a block west of the @entity19 , to transform it into a $ 200 million luxury hotel			1
@entity4 interest : @entity1 has said he is closely watching what is happening regarding the @entity19 moving buildings , and may , or may not , consider getting involved @entity1 and @entity24 , pictured last year , could use their $ 200million @entity26 hotel project in @entity5 , to boost their profile for future big developments in the city and not long after the ink has dried , and @entity1 has turned his attention to his next major project			1
the @entity19 , considered by some a blot on the otherwise grand boulevard landscape it sits on , was built in the mid- 1970s - a brutalist architectural epoch that often instills strong reactions from people today			0
the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which manages real estate for the federal government , wants to cut a deal with a developer for the building , says the @entity46			0
it is looking for a developer to swap a new building with its iconic 1970s block so the @entity4 can move into larger , more contemporary premises , the news service said			2
the iconic 1970s block is considered an eyesore by some , but @entity1 and his daughter @entity55 may take on the building as a project the building has an open mezzanine and courtyard , but access to the courtyard is limited , and most of the first floor is closed for security reasons undeterred by the building 's monstrous size and design , @entity1 seems keen , telling the @entity46 : ' we ’ll be watching the @entity4 as to what ’s going to happen ...			2
whether or not we will bid on it , we may , we may not			0
' now if we do as good a job as we will do with [ the @entity17 ] , people may ask us about it			0
' the timing , at least , could fit nicely with @entity1 's schedule , the @entity77 notes , with his developers finishing the @entity17 in 2015 and wondering over the street to the @entity4 rubix cube to start the next job			1
