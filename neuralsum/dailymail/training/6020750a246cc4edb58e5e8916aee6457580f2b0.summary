by @entity0 last updated at 9:34 am on 2nd february 2012 volcanoes could give us a detectable ' warning ' decades before they erupt , say geologists			2
stones from an eruption 3,500 years ago in @entity6 hint that magma beneath the ground had been running into the magma chamber for 100 years before a huge eruption			2
the ' warning ' was no help to the @entity14 civilisation surrounding @entity15 - but seismologists could now use it to monitor supervolcanoes for imminent eruptions			1
@entity19 erupting in 2007 : researchers believe that volcanoes may give us a detectable ' sign ' that they 're going to erupt - and we could use the technique to see which ' dormant ' volcanoes are a danger the @entity15 volcano in the @entity28 lay dormant for 18,000 years before an enormous eruption 3,500 years ago , said @entity30			2
the eruption may have contributed to the collapse of the @entity33 , a @entity14 civilisation in @entity34			0
@entity35 began flooding into the magma chamber 100 years before the eruption			1
if this is a process that is repeated in most volcanic eruptions , it 's one that could be detected by geologists			0
seismic monitoring could , in theory , spot signs that magma is moving into the magma chamber - and we could even test ' dormant ' supervolcanoes such as @entity51 for signs of activity			1
@entity33 fleet in battle , c. 1500 bc : the eruption at @entity15 happened after the volcano had been dormant for 18,000 years and may have been partially responsible for the collapse of the @entity33 civilisation view of the volcano in @entity15 , @entity6 : rocks from the volcano hint that magma had been flooding the magma chamber for 100 years before the eruption most volcanic eruptions are preceded by signs that the mountain could erupt			1
authorities rely on these for a few days ' or months ' warning to evacuate the area			0
but if there were signs years or even decades before , authorities could prevent catastrophe			0
@entity77 of @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80 , says that the crystals in the rocks around the @entity15 volcano have a structure that only makes sense if magma had been entering the chamber for a century .			0

@entity35 runs into magma chamber for decades
seismologists could now detect this movement - and ' test ' if dormant supervolcanoes will erupt
authorities could have decades of warning before eruptions
