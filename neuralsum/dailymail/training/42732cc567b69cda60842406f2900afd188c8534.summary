@entity0 will need to crack the curse of @entity3 ’s monday malaise if they are to emerge from the relegation zone at @entity6			1
the @entity3 have not won in 20 attempts on a monday in the @entity8 , a wretched run stretching back to @entity10 , 2002			1
@entity0 is the ninth permanent boss who has failed to reverse the trend			1
he lost at home to @entity13 and at @entity14 last season and now takes on another @entity17 opponent in desperate need of victory			0
the @entity3 squad train week in preparation for their trip to @entity24 to face @entity6 on monday @entity3 boss @entity0 wants his side to ' finish ' their ' terrible ' monday night record against @entity6 @entity29 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 ; @entity40			1
‘ it ’s not a nice record			0
it ’s difficult to accept , ’ said the @entity41			0
‘ it ’s not normal because probably in those 20 games we ’ve played home and away , and against top teams and small teams			2
‘ maybe the players do n’t like to play on a monday night			1
maybe we should ask the @entity52 to let us play at another time			2
maybe friday ! ‘ but it ’s a terrible stat and it does n’t lie			0
i suppose it ’s a great chance to finish it			1
let ’s see if we can do it			0
’ @entity0 's side have failed to win a monday night game since april 2002 - a run spanning nine permanent bosses @entity0 and his team face trial by television at @entity64 as they look to recover from back - to - back defeats which have plunged them in to the bottom three			1
the boss , though , insists he is not concerned by a national audience			1
‘ i like the telly , that ’s where everybody can see you			0
you need to perform , ’ he said			0
‘ i prefer to take a risk and show everybody what we can do on tv			0
that way everybody can see how we respond after the 8 - 0 hammering against @entity81			0
’ @entity40 in action during @entity3 's previous match - a 0 - 2 loss against @entity85 @entity0 was in charge of @entity87 when they met @entity6 in the @entity90 play - off semi-finals in 2013			1
the @entity6 eventually won promotion to the @entity8 but @entity0 left @entity87 that summer amid the lingering row over excrement smeared in @entity6 ’s dressing - room at the @entity95			1
and @entity0 , who was furious about the incident , said : ‘ i ca n’t explain it , no. it would be nice if one day someone could explain it to all of us because we still do n’t know what happened			2
’ he added : ‘ i ’ll probably get a hostile reception			0
i like that as well			0
when nobody cares about you , that ’s when you feel rubbish			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , will include @entity40 after the striker trained over the weekend			1
there had been fears the two - goal top scorer had broken a metatarsal during the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity85 but he is fit and will lead the line			2
@entity40 ( right ) is used to a relegation dog fight after going down with both @entity117 and @entity118			2

@entity6 host @entity3 at @entity64 on monday ( *8pm* kick - off )
@entity3 failed to win on monday night in 20 attempts since april 2002
@entity0 insists @entity6 gives @entity3 ' great chance to finish it '
he is the ninth permanent @entity3 boss to fail to reverse the trend
@entity3 boss *joked* his side may prefer to play on a friday instead
@entity40 fit for @entity3 as they look to move out of bottom three
