at first glance , this picture appears to show a normal hand			2
but a closer inspection reveals there is a prosthetic digit in the place of the thumb , so life - like it is almost impossible to spot the silicone prosthesis is the work of @entity11 company @entity38 , who aim to create individual designs tailored to each patient mr @entity25 said the ethos behind their designs is creating silicone prosthetic works of art. he said his partner started working with silicone 14 years ago , while he joined five years ago			1
mr @entity25 , who has 18 years experience creating traditional prosthetics , told @entity51 : ' @entity52 comes first			1
for every person and his or her needs are unique , and so are the restorations			2
' here each restoration is a small work of art. ' @entity23 does more of the individual silicone work while i build the prosthetic under the glove			1
' we started our own business six months ago in @entity66 , @entity11 with our special image and special prosthetics			1
' we thought we need to make something special			0
we like to show people that a prosthetic does n't need to look old and ugly			2
' we like to give a good feeling to the patients			0
it is bad enough that they have lost something			0
' so if we are able to make them happy with something cool , it feels good to everybody			0
