police turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely @entity7 men for more than a decade , it was claimed yesterday			1
research , reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls			2
the research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 were ignored by the authorities			0
in many cases , police action was taken only against the victims			0
the girl wrote that the men who groomed her told her they loved her ( posed by model ) confidential documents have revealed the scale of sexual exploitation of young white girls in @entity29 , @entity30 among the alleged crimes for which no one was prosecuted were : @entity34 headquarters in @entity35 where details of the problem of sexual exploitation are revealed in internal reports prepared by the force according to previously confidential documents seen by @entity43 , police in @entity29 , @entity30 , found evidence of thousands of similar crimes and described ‘ networks of @entity48 males exploiting young white females ’			1
the groups were reported to have trafficked victims to cities including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
despite this , just two prosecutions of groups of men for sexual abuse have taken place in @entity30 since 1996			1
the revelations about sexual exploitation in @entity29 echo the activities of a street - grooming gang which preyed on dozens of young girls in @entity67 , @entity54			1
nine members of the group , including ringleader @entity70 , 59 , were jailed for a total of 77 years by a judge at @entity73 in may			2
an 11 - week trial heard that the men would target vulnerable teenage girls and pass them around for sex			1
if the girls did not submit , they were plied with cheap vodka and raped			1
it emerged during the trial that police and social services had missed opportunities to stop the abuse			0
@entity70 , pictured above , was jailed for 19 years for his role in the street - grooming ring			2
in august he was given a separate 22 - year prison term , to run concurrently with the first , after he was convicted of raping another child in his community			1
earlier this month , @entity90 announced that a serious case review into the exploitation would be held			0
the board 's chairman @entity93 told the @entity95 that the review would look at the experiences of four young people and how agencies responded to their needs			0
the review would focus on what help was available to the girls in the early stages of their ordeal and how reports of concern about the victims were handled			0
in 2002 , @entity111 - funded research criticised officers for treating young victims as ‘ deviant and promiscuous ’ while ‘ the men they were found with were never questioned or investigated ’			1
revealing the fears over the racial element to the abuse , a 2010 report from the @entity118 said the crimes had ‘ cultural characteristics ... which are locally sensitive in terms of diversity ’ , but warned of ‘ sensitivities of ethnicity with potential to endanger the harmony of community relationships ’			1
@entity131 , mp for @entity29 , said : ‘ there ’s a culture here of denial and cover - up and a refusal to accept the reality that we have men living in the @entity29 community who treat young girls as objects for their sexual pleasure			1
it ’s time to tell the truth			0
we must root out this evil			0
’ the revelations come only three months after it emerged that social services in @entity29 had known for six years that a teenage mother , murdered for bringing shame on the families of two men who had used her for sex , was at clear risk from predatory gangs			1
@entity160 , 17 , had been groomed by a string of men before she was stabbed and thrown into a canal to die for informing her abusers ' families of the sexual relationships			2
her killer @entity167 , who was 18 at the time , was given a life sentence and will serve a minimum of 17 - and - a - half years after he pleaded guilty to murdering @entity160 in october 2010			2
but it emerged in june that @entity172 's social services were well aware she was at risk and had received information about certain adults suspected of targeting her from the age of 11			1
a serious case review report confirmed that @entity160 had dealings with 15 agencies and identified ' numerous missed opportunities ' to protect her			0
it stated that she eventually became ' almost invisible ' to care professional			0
@entity172 's @entity186 member for services for children , young people and families , councillor @entity184 , said : ' there is no question that we will do whatever we can to protect our young people from harm in whatever form that threat takes			2
' @entity198 has already acknowledged publicly that there have been lessons learnt from previous work , cases and investigations and that the support offered to a small number of vulnerable young people has not always reached the high standards we always look to provide			1
' from that learning , improvements have been made and new services introduced and those developments will continue			0
' following the recommendations from a serious case review , inspections and our own learning on other cases , the sexual exploitation team has recently evolved from the original youth serviceproject into the new multi-agency service to improve preventative and support work along with boosting efforts to investigate cases and bring people to justice			1
' we are also maintaining our major investment in protecting children at a time when public sector budgets are under increasing pressure			0
eight men who gave young girls small change and cuddly toys in exchange for sex were jailed yesterday			1
the predators , who picked up victims aged between 13 and 15 from care homes and the streets , slept with them for as little as £ 5			0
others received cigarettes and ‘ treats ’ , including toys			2
@entity245 , 51 , @entity246 , 44 , @entity247 , 55 , @entity248 , 35 , @entity249 , 40 , @entity250 , 55 , @entity251 , 56 , and @entity252 , 60 , were jailed for a total of 41 years and seven months at @entity254 for a series of sex offences			2
' we have pledged our commitment by prioritising the amount of money being put into safeguarding services along with prevention and early help work with families to help ensure they get the support they need			0
' sexual predators do come from different sections of the community and are criminals who need to be brought to justice regardless of their background			0
' we have worked closely with communities and community leaders across @entity29 in recent years to enlist their support in helping to tackle some of these issues and to educate people about sexual exploitation			1
' the response has been very positive and our commitment to continue to tackle this issue is shared by local agencies and our communities			0
' a @entity34 spokesman said any suggestion that it ‘ and its partners have been reluctant to tackle child sexual abuse is wrong ’			1
he added that safeguarding children was not just about prosecuting individuals .			0
