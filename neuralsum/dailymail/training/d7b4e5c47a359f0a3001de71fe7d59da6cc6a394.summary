in 1977 , @entity0 earned the top honor in the writing world when he was honored with a @entity3			1
but nearly four decades later , the former @entity5 critic now hovers on the brink of poverty thanks to a failing pension and a bit of bad luck on the stock market			1
in a heartbreaking essay for @entity13 , @entity0 describes what it 's like to become poor in old age - as part of a overlooked group who are neither middle or lower class			1
former teachers and even lawyers who ca n't pay their bills but are n't on the streets begging for change			2
surprisingly , he says the experience has been educational and that he still considers himself privileged due to his race			2
what it 's like to be poor : @entity3 winning writer @entity0 ( pictured ) wrote a heartbreaking essay about his descent into poverty ' compared with most poor people , i am fortunate , ' he wrote			1
' if you ’ve got to be poor , finding yourself at the upper edge of poverty with a roof over your head and a wardrobe that does n’t look as if it came from the @entity43 is as good as it gets			2
' it also helps to be white			2
' @entity0 relays a terrible anecdote in which his former personal trainer @entity47 , who is @entity48 , sees a client walking on the street			1
when he tried to greet her , the woman immediately wrote him off and said ' i do n't have any , i do n't have any money '			0
she did n't even look up to recognize the man she saw regularly at the gym			0
' she did n't see @entity47 ; she saw a black man in trainers about to ask her for a handout on one of the busier avenues in the city			0
@entity47 does n’t look like a hustler			0
he does n’t look poor			0
i do n’t look poor , either , but i am white			0
so i never suffered that kind of demeaning slight			0
' @entity0 started at the @entity5 as a copy boy but worked his way up to book editor during his 25 off - and - on years at the paper			1
seventeen years into his tenure at the @entity5 , @entity0 left to work at a @entity72 publishing agency - just a year before profit - sharing would have taken effect			1
eventually , the @entity5 's editor coaxed @entity0 back to journalism where he went to cover @entity77 after the fall of @entity79 and win a @entity3 for this critical writing			1
it was when he decided to leave for @entity77 that @entity0 's first financial problems started happening - but he did n't know their repercussions at the time			1
worthless : the 81 - year - old spent 25 years working at the @entity5 , but after deciding to take an early retirement in 1986 , his pension is now worth half what he saved against the advice of more stock market - saavy friends , @entity0 invested in @entity92 before it was popular and @entity93 when the tech company was at a low			1
he made good money when both stocks bounded , but lost that money when he handed over his capital to a manager to travel @entity77			0
like many @entity100 , he lost a lot of money when the stock market crashed			0
then , in 1986 , when @entity0 was in the middle of a leave of absence , the @entity5 asked him to either come back to work or take an early retirement			1
' i was fifty - three at the time			2
i chose retirement because i was under the illusion — perhaps delusion is the more accurate word — that i could make a living as a writer and the @entity5 offered to keep me on their medical insurance program , which at the time was very good and very cheap , ' @entity0 wrote			1
however , that choice proved costly since by the time his pension kicked in at age 65 , the money he had saved on the @entity5 's 401 ( k ) plan was half it 's worth since it is not adjusted for inflation			1
while @entity0 's $ 11,670 income puts him above the poverty line ( which last year was a close $ 11,490 ) , he still considers himself poor ' by any rational standard '			1
he is forced to live in subsidized housing , with neighbors including a great - grandson of @entity130 , former lawyers , academics and fellow writers			2
the @entity134 is also subsidizing his medical insurance payments , after a major heart attack left him with astronomical bills			0
however , he does n't blame his misfortune on the economy			0
when he was younger he says he was ' foolish , careless and sometimes stupid ' spending money without thinking of the long - term consequences			2
while he does n't regret any of it , he does n't like having to rely on his family for so much now that he is older			0
' sometimes , i find it deeply humiliating that i am dependent on such kindnesses when i would prefer that the kindnesses flow the other way			0
most of the time , though , i am just extremely grateful for the help of family and friends			0
it ’s not so much humiliating as it is humbling , which is a good thing			0

@entity0 spent 25 years working at the @entity5 , but because he retired early his pension is now worth half what he saved
the 81 - year - old now makes $ 11,670 a year from *social* *security* and his retirement , which puts him just above the poverty line
