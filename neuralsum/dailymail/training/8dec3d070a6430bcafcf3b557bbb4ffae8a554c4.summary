by @entity0 @entity1 has been accused of taking acting lessons before standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend @entity5			1
a @entity8 journalist wrote an open letter to the blade runner alleging he had taken guidance from one of her ' close friends ' before taking the stand in @entity16			1
@entity18 - born columnist @entity17 has called the paralympian a ' faux hero ' who has ' betrayed people and disappointed his fans			1
your coach has an impossible task			1
' ' @entity1 , i look at you mewling and puking in the witness stand			2
you truly represent everything that the @entity46 loathes about white @entity8 who live extravagant lives in their expensive laagers			1
' asked about her letter , she told @entity51 : ' i have this information from extremely reliable sources			2
' she also compares @entity1 to @entity54 , who served three years in prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996			2
she said of him : ' @entity59 was cut from the same cloth as you , @entity1			2
' he was given to boasting , vain in all things , narcissistic in the extreme and flying into terrible rages when things did n’t go his way			2
i suspect this description fits you			0
' the @entity69 superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial			0
@entity5 's mother @entity72 has also accused the @entity8 of acting out , referring to moments he has wept uncontrollable while sitting in the dock			1
in the early stages of his trial dr @entity76 analysed his body language			0
curious : the claims came just weeks after @entity5 's mother accused the paralympian of acting she said : ' @entity1 has to project a complex image of innocence and grief to the mass media and court			1
' his squeaky clean image comes natural to him with his short hair , relaxed wide - eyed response in social interaction and charming smile			0
' what @entity1 has to juggle in court is his three public personas : the boyish wonder he stage - managed for the global media – who will challenge any obstacle and which refutes his disability ; the humble , controlled , grieving @entity1 for public consumption in the courts and the suave flash harry , fast cars , gung - ho image of @entity1 with adoring women draped on his arm			0
' his dramatic , tearful breakdown in court - when the brutal wounds on @entity115 ’s @entity5 ’s body were discussed - is more likely to be conveniently staged			0
i believe such behaviour serves to hide his feelings of sickening guilt and vulnerability			0
' @entity1 admits shooting 29 - year - old @entity5 on @entity121 last year but denies premeditated murder and two counts related to shooting a gun			0
the trail continues on may 5			0
