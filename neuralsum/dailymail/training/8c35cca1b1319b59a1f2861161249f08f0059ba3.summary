by @entity0 last updated at 1:37 pm on 16th august 2011 at first glance , it could be the perfect occupation for a @entity4 monk seeking the isolation to pray and lead a simple life			2
but the last cowboy monks in the @entity8 are being forced to sell off their 1,900 - acre farm in @entity10 because of a chronic lack of ' @entity12 '			1
since 1893 , @entity4 monks have kept cattle at @entity15 , a @entity17 cloister in the hill country established near a then railway town			1
rural idyll : @entity21 has tended the @entity15 herd for 51 years , but the number of monks has dwindled one of around 40 @entity4 monasteries in the @entity8 , it originally raised pigs , chickens and dairy cows but switched to beef ranching when these became unprofitable			1
now @entity32 , 76 , who has tended the herd for more than half a century , is finally hanging up his spurs as he is unable to carry out the heavy manual labour to look after 318 cattle			1
dying breed : brother @entity32 , 76 , tends to the cattle at the @entity4 monastery ranch in @entity40 , @entity10			1
the farm is being sold off due to a lack of new recruits @entity44 laid down his rule in the 6th century and it is largely regarded as the basis for @entity48 monasticism			2
around the year 500 , @entity44 became disillusioned with the immorality of @entity50 and left the city to live as a hermit in a cave near @entity54			2
the @entity55 stipulates absolute obedience , forbids private possessions and has a ' three strikes and you 're out ' policy for monks leaving the abbey			2
it also forbids monks from striking each other and lay out rules on how much food they are allowed to eat			2
celibacy is compulsory and it takes four years to become a @entity71 monk			1
many @entity4 monks , particularly in @entity73 and the @entity74 , brew alcohol and wine as it is not forbidden under the rule			2
even bringing in hired help to assist with hay baling and fence repairs would be too expensive and against the @entity55 , which requires that monks ' are true monks who live by the labour of their hands '			0
younger recruits are becoming much less common too			0
the last @entity8 monk to be accepted at the @entity15 was in 2002 , and the 28 remaining in residence have been unable to recruit more			0
in the autumn , the abbey will sell of its herd of 155 black angus cows , 155 calves and eight bulls			1
it will also rent out some of its alfalfa fields and pasture land to neighbours			0
brother @entity32 told the @entity100 : ' it 's so good to have the animals here , to see cows when you look out the window or go for a walk			1
' i 'll miss it a lot			0
but i know that there comes a time in life when you have to retire			0
' the order dates back to @entity44 , who in the sixth century set rules for monasteries where monks lived communally , sharing duties and spending their time in prayer or working			0
once they have joined , monks are expected to spend the rest of their lives with the abbey			0
every day , prayer services begin at 6.20am and 11.40am , @entity124 at 5pm and vespers at 7pm			0
the monks were normal clothes during the day , but habits for the evening services			0
they also enjoy watching baseball in the evenings , and get popcorn , beer and rented films on saturday nights			0
brother @entity32 joined the abbey at the age of 22 after working on his parents ' farm			1
he began wrangling cows while riding bareback , but now uses an all - terrain vehicle to cover the vast ranch .			1

@entity32 , 76 , has tended herd for 50 years
1,900 - acre @entity10 ranch was established in 1893
