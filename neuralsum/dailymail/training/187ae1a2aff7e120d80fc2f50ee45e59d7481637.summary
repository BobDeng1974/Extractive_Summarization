by @entity0 pledging beforehand not to whine - because kids whine - competitors took on electric shocks , ice baths and plenty of mud in a knew craze sweeping the nation			1
following success across the pond people have been fighting to sign up for this gruelling 12 - mile obstacle course as it made its way to the @entity13 for the first time this year			1
designed by @entity15 burly men and women , working in teams , took on the @entity20 event at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
billed as the ultimate test of strength , stamina , determination and camaraderie , people brave enough to sign up to the event make their way though a host of eye - watering obstacles			0
from an ice bath labelled the ' @entity27 ' to ' @entity55 ' and the ' @entity56 ' the course is certainly not for the faint - hearted			1
electrifying : these brave competitors endure a wave of electric shocks from these fine wires that hang down , in the aptly named @entity56 stage of the course suit - ably difficult : with prizes for best and worst costumes many entrants dress up to trawl through miles of mud swamped : teams trudge through waist high sludge during the appropriately named @entity69 but @entity70 are certainly warned about what to expect beforehand , as they are led through a pledge			1
dirty work : covered head to toe in mud , this competitor seemed to be enjoying the hardcore course not only do they have to vow not to whine - because kids whine - but they must promise to overcome all fears , put teamwork and camaraderie before a course time and understand that @entity20 is not a race but a challenge			2
and challanged they are , as these pictures show , with many of them needing a helping hand to cross the finish line			0
but it is not all pain and dirt , with plenty of other unusual elements to the bizarre event			0
with prizes for best and worst costumes , least clothing and ' most likely to have been in the @entity102 ' there were plenty of wacky fancy dress attempts			0
and it was not just attire that turned the eye			0
with free head - shaves available on site there were also prizes dished out for toughest mullet and toughest mohawk - while anyone bearing a @entity20 tattoo was also in for an award			2
so if you love nothing more than trawling through mud , ice baths and taking on the odd electric shock while dressed like a head shaven @entity123 , fear not			0
because the next tough @entity20 is just around the corner , with six more events planned in the @entity13 for next year			1
first port of call will be @entity128 in may , before tours in @entity130 , @entity43 , @entity131 , the @entity132 and @entity133 before the end of the year			0
@entity135 , muddy @entity136 : one man dressed as @entity123 trudges through the mud with festive cheer tough love : part of the ethos of the @entity20 is to help others through the course when it all gets a bit too much			2
