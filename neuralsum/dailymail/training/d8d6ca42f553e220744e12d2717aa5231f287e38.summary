by @entity0 published : 01:05 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 23 october 2013 @entity1 has removed a video of a woman being beheaded following the huge public outcry that was sparked by their lifting of a ban on gory imagery on monday			1
the abrupt abrupt flip - flop came a day after a public outcry over news reports that @entity1 , the world 's no. 1 social network with 1.15 billion members , had lifted a temporary ban on images of graphic violence			1
@entity1 said on monday that gory videos , such as a video of a masked man beheading a woman in @entity22 , are permitted on its site so long as the content is posted in a manner intended for its users to ' condemn ' the acts rather than celebrate them			1
gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on @entity1 once again			1
the social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos , but not celebrate them but @entity1 said on tuesday that it had decided to ' strengthen ' its enforcement of the policy			1
' when we review content that is reported to us , we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video , ' @entity1 said in a statement			1
' second , we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly , such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age - appropriate audience , ' @entity1 said			1
the flip - flop underscores a challenge for @entity1 as it seeks to position itself as the go - to online destination where people share up - to - the - minute images and discuss breaking news events			0
alert : @entity1 has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations @entity1 initially claimed that the criticism it received did not affect its decision but later on tuesday admitted it had			2
the @entity61 prime minister @entity60 went on the warpath on tuesday accusing @entity1 of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents			1
critics accused the firm of ‘ taking leave of its senses ’			0
@entity1 had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘ sadistic pleasure ’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them			2
however , last night it was revealed @entity1 had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site			1
@entity1 ’s unpublicized change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a 57 - second video showing a young @entity22 woman , her hands tied behind her back and on her knees , being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight			1
it was posted last week under the title ‘ @entity96 can watch this video ? ’			0
the site , which is open to anyone over the age of 13 , had banned footage of decapitation on its site in may citing concerns that it would cause long - term psychological damage one disgusted viewer commented : ‘ remove this video , too many young innocent minds out there should n’t see this			1
’ another wrote : ‘ this is absolutely horrible , distasteful and needs to be removed ... i ’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it			0
’ @entity1 had introduced a temporary ban on decapitation videos in may but later removed it , explaining that the site is used to share information about world events , such as acts of terrorism and human rights abuses			1
while @entity1 polices its site to remove pornography , hate speech and other forbidden content , the company must also make a judgment about when certain grizzly images , such as video of a terrorist attack , are in the public interest versus being shared for ' sadistic pleasure			2
' @entity1 acknowledged on tuesday that its previous approach , which permitted the video of the woman 's killing in @entity22 to remain on its site , was flawed			1
' based on these enhanced standards , we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence			0
for this reason , we have removed it , ' the company said			0
@entity1 may now allow videos of people being beheaded , but there are a number of subjects and clips it will not allow to be published on in its site			1
@entity1 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a child is involved			0
elsewhere , the site imposes ‘ limitations on the display of nudity ’ but does n’t ban it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance			0
female nipples , as a rule , will be removed but male nipples are allowed			0
a photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a female nipple , before being reinstated			0
breastfeeding images were removed in 2012 , but @entity1 ’s @entity171 now states the site ‘ respects people ’s right to share content of personal importance ’ and makes explicit reference to breastfeeding			2
the pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘ actively nursing ’ but may be removed if it shows the nipple			0
children playing in the bath are accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit , while sculpture and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed , but real - life images and similar poses are not			0
another photo famously taken down showed @entity190 holding a teddy bear with her microphone positioned in such a way , between the bear ’s legs , that made it look phallic			0
@entity1 removed it for violating the use of ‘ photos that contain nudity , drug use or violence			2
’ any video that condones violence , threatens or is abusive and bullying towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited			0
any promotion or encouragement of self - mutilation , eating disorders of drug abuse is similarly banned			0
@entity1 does not permit hate speech , especially towards individuals , groups , sex , race , ethnicity , disability or sexual orientation – yet will distinguish between ‘ serious and humorous speech ’ and will allow videos and posts that ‘ challenge ideas , institutions and certain practices			2
’ sharing graphic content for ' sadistic pleasure ' is prohibited , yet if the content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be allowed as long as it balances ‘ the needs of a diverse community			0
’ @entity1 monitors photos , but also relies on its users to report content they feel should be removed			1
if a photo is under investigation it may be temporarily removed while @entity1 looks into the complaint but will be reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code .			2

@entity1 banned decapitation videos in may *due* to psychological damage
in *u-turn* it said users should be able to watch and condemn these videos
following pressure it 's removed gory video of woman being beheaded
