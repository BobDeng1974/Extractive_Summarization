by @entity0 the racial ‘ bias ’ in police use of stop - and - search powers is much worse in rural parts of @entity2 than previously thought – with black people as much as twelve times more likely to be stopped than whites			1
in 27 force areas , the true extent of the disproportionate use of so - called sus powers on black people has been revised upwards in new research by the equalities watchdog			1
these include @entity17 , where black people are a staggering twelve times more likely than whites to be stopped and searched by the police			1
in @entity23 , they are nearly eight times more likely , in @entity25 seven times and more than five times in @entity28 and @entity29			1
overall , the @entity31 figures showed lower numbers of black , mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas			2
the extent of racial bias in the @entity39 is a third lower than was thought several other forces have been shown to have much higher levels of racial bias include @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , the @entity50 report shows			2
the new figures – which will be a major concern to ministers , officers and race campaigners – emerged after stop and search numbers were re-calculated with up - to - date population estimates from the @entity31			1
in a report released yesterday , the @entity50 and @entity59 compared figures for how many people in force areas in different ethnic groups with stop and search totals for 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12			1
home secretary @entity67 is reining in stop and search powers under section 1 of the @entity72 officers can to stop and search someone if they have reasonable suspicion they are about to commit an offence			1
overall , the @entity31 figues showed lower numbers of black , mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas			2
by contrast , the numbers for urban areas are much higher			2
as a result , researchers have recalculated the extent to which stops and searches are ‘ disproportionate ’ across @entity2 and @entity87			2
in @entity17 , the size of the black population is 2,920 – less than half the earlier estimate of 7,480			2
the old figures suggested 3.8 black people were stopped for every white person , compared to more than ten under the new calculation for 2011 , and nearly 12 in the 2012 figures			0
the extent of racial bias was found to be twice as high in @entity98 , and nearly twice as high in @entity99 than previously thought			0
the census also showed ethnic minority populations in urban areas were much higher			0
that means urban forces , including the @entity39 , @entity105 and @entity106 , have lower levels of racial bias , and search fewer black people as a proportion of the overall population			1
the extent of racial bias in the @entity39 is a third lower than was thought			0
the force carried out 471,336 – or 47 per cent – of the 1.1million stop and searches in @entity2 and @entity87 last year			1
the @entity31 showed there are 888,166 black people living in @entity118 , compared with 662 , 396 under old @entity120 ( @entity120 ) population projections			0
the estimate for people of mixed race has increased from 188,784 to 280,891			0
these mean that rather than five black people being stopped and searched for every white person , the true figure is just over three			0
for people of mixed race , the proportion has nearly halved			0
across @entity2 and @entity87 , the revised figures show 6.5 stops of a black person for every white , instead of 7.5 under the previous population figures			0
the extent of racial bias in stop and search was cited as a major factor in the causes for the 2011 riots by some commentators			1
home secretary @entity67 is reining in stop and search powers after figures showed just 9 per cent of all stops led to an arrest			1
in some parts of the country , the figure is as low as 3 per cent , raising huge question marks over whether the power is being used properly			0
a spokesman for the @entity50 said : ‘ the change from @entity120 population estimates by ethnic group to @entity31 data has revised population profiles for some police force areas with either relatively lower or higher ethnic minority populations			0
‘ this either increases or decreases estimates of race disproportionality			0
’ ‘ for example , @entity17 , @entity23 and @entity25 have higher figures for black / white disproportionality based on the @entity31 estimates , while @entity165 and @entity166 have lower figures			1

in @entity23 , they are nearly eight times more likely , in @entity25 seven times and more than five times in @entity28 and @entity29
