@entity11 from @entity12 warns against @entity6 's resolutions after becoming anorexic as a child she did everything she could to avoid consuming carbohydrates and even diluted skimmed milk with water because she was convinced she would get fat			1
shockingly , by the age of 13 her weight had plunged to under five stone and she was admitted to an adolescent psychiatric unit in @entity32 after falling critically ill. she stayed there for three ears and continued to battle with the disease until she went to university			1

finally she beat the disease and is now studying to be a doctor			1
@entity11 today warns youngsters not to crash diet in the @entity6			1
at home in @entity12 aged eight ( left ) ; @entity11 ( pictured right , now ) says she used to look at her body and think she was fat ' when i was nine , i looked at my body and thought i looked fat so i made my @entity6 's resolution , i banned chocolate , ' she says			1
' but at the age of 13 , i started cutting out carbs and fats			1
i began to dilute my skimmed milk			1
in the end i was just eating a tiny amount , a small number of calories a day			1
' it 's difficult to pinpoint why i did it			1
i think it was possibly a number of factors - a genetic disposition , my personality and the fact that i was bullied at school			1
' my mother thought i was underweight			1
she took me to the @entity69 , who asked me whether i had a problem			2
' i said no. i thought i was just being sensible about what i ate			2
' and on the third time she took me to the surgery , she was told she was fussing			2
there was nothing to worry about			2
' she was n't having it , finally , she took me to a different gp who said straight away that i had quite severe anorexia and referred me to a specialist			1
' i could n't believe i was anorexic , i did n't think that was me , i felt i quite enjoyed food			2
' i 've since read that most anorexics feel the same way			2
' my parents were upset and angry , as most parents would be			2
they could n't understand why i was doing what i was doing to myself			2
@entity11 aged seven before her harrowing ordeal , which led her to weigh 5 stone at 13 ' three months later , i became critically ill. ' my @entity91 ( body mass index ) was so low that i was exhausted and freezing , i hurt all over , i was miserable , i could n't concentrate			1
' i was in a really awful way			2
' i was referred to an adolescent psychiatric unit in @entity32			2
they said i 'd stay there for four months - but i ended up staying for two years			2
' but i was n't scared			2
i had completely lost my emotional response			0
there were other kids in there and we got on quite well			0
the staff made it a friendly place			0
' i was put on a strict regime of eating , had one - to - one psychotherapy , attended body image groups , lessons in family therapy and group therapeutic sessions			0
' when i looked at myself in the mirror i thought i looked normal , or that i could still lose a bit			0
' but others there looked completely emaciated			0
i could n't believe i was grouped with them			0
' then i 'd be shocked to find that their @entity91 was actually higher than mine			0
@entity11 agreed to be put on a drip after hitting an all - time low and realising things had to change ' i finally came out of hospital when i was 16 years old			1
i found adjusting to everyday life difficult but i 'd had so much help and treatment that i was ready for it			0
' and i desperately did n't want to go back to hospital			0
' i passed five gcses and went on to sixth form to do a-levels			0
i think i was lucky that i landed on my feet			0
' i had a good time at sixth form , and i was quite well for around 18 months			0
' then , gradually , various things like boyfriend trouble triggered off a chain of weight yo - yoing			1
' i lost a stone , then i put on a bit			1
that went on for three years until i went to university			0
' by the end of the year , i was so poorly that i was beyond help			0
' my organs started failing - i was more seriously ill than i had ever been			1
' i was completely yellow with jaundice and i started vomiting			0
@entity144 rushed me to @entity145			0
they wanted to put me on a drip			0
' i remember thinking they were going to pump me with liquidised @entity150 bar			0
' i had a big tantrum			0
' they threatened to section me and i finally agreed for them to put me on a drip			0
i knew i was at an all - time low			0
i realised things had got to change			0
' i would urge all young people not to give up food as a @entity6 's resolution because it could trigger something much more serious			1
