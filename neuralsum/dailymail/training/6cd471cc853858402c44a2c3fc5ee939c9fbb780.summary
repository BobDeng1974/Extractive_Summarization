a cure for marijuana abuse could be on the horizon thanks to a new finding			0
researchers found that increasing the levels of a naturally occurring acid in the brain could stop addicts who are trying to give up from relapsing			1
the scientists discovered that kynurenic acid reduces the kick monkeys and rats get from @entity13 – the active ingredient in marijuana			1
researchers found that increasing the levels of a kynurenic acid - which occurs naturally in the brain - could stop addicts who are trying to give up marijuana from relapsing the researchers , at the @entity24 , in the @entity23 , explained that drug abuse is controlled by dopamine and that kynurenic acid influences dopamine , @entity22 reports			1
the acid is effective because it blocks the receptors that cause the positive feelings inspired by dopamine			1
@entity13 activates dopamine neurones in the brain which causes cells to release dopamine			2
@entity37 acid – which can be produced from bananas and turkey – is thought to cause fewer side effects than other treatments that have been considered because it occurs naturally in the brain			2
to test the effectiveness of the treatment , @entity43 and his colleagues gave rats and monkeys a drug that increased their levels of the acid while the creatures self - administered @entity13			2
they found the animals were less interested in the @entity13 when they were being given the treatment			0
the researchers also tried taking the animals off the @entity13 and then increased their acid levels while giving them a small amount of @entity13			0
cure for cannabis abuse ? the researchers explained that drug abuse is controlled by dopamine - and that kynurenic acid is effective because it blocks the receptors that cause the positive feelings inspired by dopamine they found that increasing the levels of the acid stopped the rats and monkeys reverting to their previous pattern of drug use			1
‘ we found that you can reduce dopamine levels and the animals behave differently — they do n't have relapse , and do n't abuse marijuana , ’ dr @entity43 told @entity22			0
the findings have not yet been tested in people and it is not known whether the treatment would act on other parts of the brain as well			0
' a medication that would safely and effectively assist in the treat ­ ment of marijuana dependence would be an important step forward in dealing with cannabis - use disorders , ' he added , writing in the journal @entity93 .			0

naturally occurring acid in the brain could stop addicts from relapsing
called kynurenic acid , it reduces the kick monkeys and rats get from @entity13 – the active ingredient in marijuana
blocks the receptors that cause the positive feelings inspired by dopamine - which gives the high from drug use
