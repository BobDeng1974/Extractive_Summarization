in the midst of a foul - mouthed tirade in a @entity4 cinema , @entity0 has struck a side bet with @entity6 as to who will win their world heavyweight title eliminator in @entity9 on saturday week			1
whether the bet is for £ 10,000 , £ 100,000 or winner takes all the purse was unclear amid the four - letter mayhem			2
what is certain is that @entity16 boxing has taken its first steps down from the honourable peak reached with @entity20 's victory over @entity21 in front of 80,000 people at @entity24			0
in most other sports the @entity9 giant of the prize ring would be facing either a ban or a heavy fine for bringing the game into disrepute			1
boxing tends to turn a blind eye to what is considered to be promotional activity , as it has done with similar outbursts at previous events during the build - up for this particular encounter			0
at one , in @entity9 , @entity0 was busy swearing and turning over tables			1
the stage is set : @entity0 and @entity6 attend a press conference at a west @entity4 cinema @entity71 managed to remain largely restrained in the face of unpleasant mocking of his manhood but was the first to provoke a wager			1
he shouted : ' i bet you 10 grand i knock you out			2
' @entity0 responded : ' 10 grand is chump money to me			1
i give the kids that to go to the shops			0
make it winner takes all ... or at least 100 grand			2
' @entity6 charged forward and said : ' ok , let 's shake on it			1
' fighting talk : @entity6 and @entity0 exchanged insults during a press conference and made a side bet worth £ 10,000 to the winner foul language : @entity0 was not to concerned about his words as he traded insults with @entity6 the clasping of hands was as near as @entity0 came to civilised behaviour but was still an ugly , tugging and shoving affair			1
@entity102 regulations forbid fighters from betting on the sport with bookmakers but side stakes are permitted			2
@entity6 lost his personal wager with @entity108 and after being knocked out at @entity111 's @entity110 stadium paid the £ 20,000 to charity			1
as the profanities continued , @entity6 said : ' i must apologise on behalf of my opponent for his language			2
' @entity0 gave this angry retort : ' i do n't give a f * * * how many women and children are in the audience			2
we 're getting near to the fight and i 'm in fight mode , kill mode			0
' that is just a sample of how unsavoury it was			0
each promised to knock the other out and be the one to go on to challenge @entity132 for the @entity134 heavyweight title			0
that could be sometime in the making , although whether the high class @entity132 camp will want to involve themselves in such shenanigans has to be open to question			0
promoter @entity140 , who is also @entity6 's manager , has been going to considerable lengths to sell the july 26 spectacle in @entity9 at a time when the run - up to this rematch has been overshadowed by the @entity147 finals			1
but he moved to end quickly this last head - to - head meeting in @entity4			0
@entity140 said : ' it 's not easy getting all of this together with so much interest in the @entity147 but we 're getting there			0
' this fracas in a west @entity4 cinema was not of his making			0
whether or not it boosts ticket sales and television subscriptions , it is not much help for the image of boxing			0
@entity0 vs @entity6 will be televised live on @entity164 on saturday july 26			1
