by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:09 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 14:03 est , 12 november 2012 @entity2 joined in with thousands of other @entity4 users who speculated on the identity of an anonymous child abuser speaker 's wife @entity2 may be facing legal action after she wrongly hinted that @entity11 was a child abuser on @entity4 - but she still ca n't stop tweeting			1
the outspoken wife of @entity15 @entity14 today joked merrily about the unfolding crisis and even compared @entity19 boss @entity18 to terror suspect @entity17			1
she had been forced to apologise to former @entity15 treasurer @entity11 after she joined an internet frenzy that followed a botched @entity22 report wrongly implicating him			1
on november 4 , mrs @entity2 tweeted : ' why is @entity11 trending ? * innocent face * ' – a reference to the fact the peer 's name was being repeatedly mentioned on @entity4			1
she then issued an apology - alongside @entity31 columnist @entity30 - when lawyers for the former @entity34 aide threatened to sue			2
the mother - of - three wrote : ' i * have * apologised			2
' but she was back on fine @entity39 form later , retweeting a comment that said ' ca n't help but think it would be easier to get rid of @entity17 if he were director general of the @entity42 ' and commenting ' @entity43 ! '			1
she then retweeted another message that stated : ' did we see @entity46 stepping down because the shoddy and unacceptable mistakes his journalists made ? no. we did not			2
' earlier she had remained defiant when asked by one user if she was not the ' teensiest bit embarrassed ( and fearful of impending legal action ) ? ' , replying simply : ' nope			2
' she added in another tweet : ' now counting coins in piggy bank coz @entity11 will probably sue my a * * *			2
' she says she has not heard from @entity11 's lawyers			2
legal experts say the pair 's public apologies might not be enough to save them from being sued for libel			2
@entity63 , head of media law at @entity65 , said : ' are you responsible for what you publish on your @entity4 account ? the answer is yes			1
@entity4 gaffe : speaker 's wife @entity2 ( left ) has apologised after highlighting @entity4 discussions that falsely named @entity11 ( right ) as a child abuser following a botched @entity22 report ' they 're just as liable as any broadcaster or newspaper who named him			1
' in an attempt to save face she tweeted this morning that she was sorry but maintained she was not admitting being libellous			2
' yes , i have apologised for @entity85 tweet			1
in which i noted that his name was trending ( which , at the time , it was )			0
i was irresponsible , ' she wrote			0
' i have not heard from @entity11 's lawyers			0
tho ' i may do			0
as may thousands of @entity4 users , some of whom tweeted far worse			1
libellous ? i do n't think so			0
but we 'll have to see ... ' wish the focus would shift back onto , y'know , * child abuse * - not just @entity42 & libel threats			1
' the one - time celebrity big brother contestant @entity99 joined in with thousands speculating on the identity of the unnamed senior conservative peer accused of abusing former care resident @entity103 at a home in @entity106 during the @entity107 and @entity108			1
mrs @entity2 's @entity4 came before it came to light that @entity11 had no involvement with the alleged abuse at the @entity103 care home			1
when asked by @entity114 who @entity11 would be taking legal action against , @entity112 of @entity113 , said : ' i ca n't tell you that at the moment , it 's currently in legal process			0
@entity2 took to @entity4 to comment on speculation as to the identity of the @entity15 at the centre of a @entity22 investigation ' i ca n't confirm any names but i am not ruling any out			1
' @entity114 attempted to contact mrs @entity2 for a response today but she declined to comment			1
mr @entity30 also wrote cryptic messages on the social networking site , including : ' historical fact of the week : @entity11 was a well - known treasurer of the @entity15 during the @entity34 era			0
' he has also said sorry in a blog that was headed ' an abject apology '			0
the @entity42 was forced to apologise to @entity11 , a friend and ally of @entity34 , after the claims made by @entity42 ’s current affairs flagship			0
as a result of the programme , @entity11 was wrongly named on the internet as the @entity15 politician referred to , but not directly named , in the programme			0
though it is quite wrong to lust after a man called ' @entity46 ' obvs			0
@ sallybercow prince @entity148 calls wind farms " useless " and " completely reliant on subsidies "			2
oh the irony : ) @ sallybercow @entity152 i hate tourists , shuffling along , blocking pavement , stopping to take pics every two seconds			0
@ @entity158 ' it 's very sad that @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 are going under , i never * actually * shop at any of ' em.			0
. @entity162 chocolate is yuck tasting rip - off , carpet is overrated ( wood & rugs the way to go ) and @entity160 clothes for skinny minnies ... @ @entity174 has landed ! @entity175 the occasion by sponsoring my parachute jump for @entity178 and gay rights			0
@ sallybercow i got a dodge @entity181 card for £ 10 down the pub. thought i was being savvy – turns out i was just a pawn in @entity46 ’s game			0
@ @entity184 now slightly tempted to try mexxy before it becomes illegal ? i wo n’t , obvs			0
following the false claims , @entity42 director general @entity18 resigned last night with further senior figures at the @entity189 expected to follow suit			0
speaking today , @entity191 , chair of the @entity192 , described the investigation as ' disfigured '			1
he said : ' i think he felt he ( @entity194 ) should take responsibility for the awful journalism which disfigured that @entity22 programme			1
' aside from her infamous appearance on reality tv , mrs @entity2 has hit the headlines on numerous occasions for her outlandish antics which include posing naked except for a bedsheet and admitting binge - drinking and one night stands			1
she has also courted controversy on @entity4 , by slamming this summer 's jubilee celebrations and discussing drug taking with her 56,000 followers			1
journalists quickly laid seige to @entity11 's @entity212 home after his name was connected with the scandal but it soon emerged that the story was false			0
@entity11 's name was cleared in connection with abuse at the @entity103 care home in the original @entity221 inquiry in 1998			0
his cousin @entity222 was originally named as the object of rumours by people connected with the care home			0
@entity227 told the inquiry that he believed a @entity11 was guilty of abusing him but would not reveal who told him so or the accused 's first name , but he did say that the @entity85 in question was dead			1
@entity11 was hounded by press in connection with the case but it soon became clear that he had nothing to do with the case .			2

@entity2 took to @entity4 to speculate on the identity of the unnamed child abuser featured in a @entity22 investigation
today she apologises for naming @entity85 but calls it ' mischievous '
but she is still commenting and making jokes about the case !
