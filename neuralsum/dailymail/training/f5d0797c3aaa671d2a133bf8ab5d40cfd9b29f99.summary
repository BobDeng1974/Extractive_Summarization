by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 19 march 2013 the phrase ' i ’m eating for two ' has burdened many pregnant women with extra weight to lose after giving birth			1
even though official guidelines suggest women should put on no more than two stone while pregnant , it ’s easy to get carried away during those nine months and recent statistics have found that up to 15 per cent of mothers are obese during pregnancy , jeopardising not only their own health , but also that of the next generation			1
@entity16 was certainly eating for two and piled on a staggering 8st 5lbs during her pregnancy , making her clinically obese			1
eating for two : @entity16 , who put on weight after being pregnant with her daughter @entity19 , has now gone from 19st back to 10st due to her sudden weight gain , she was left suffering from birth complications , agoraphobia , anxiety and panic attacks			1
@entity16 , 25 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , reached 19st by the time she gave birth to baby @entity19 , going from a size 12 to a maternity size 24			1
when her daughter was born - weighing in at a large 10lb 3oz - guilt - ridden @entity16 blamed herself for making her baby fat			1
now after a two - year battle , she has lost most of the weight thanks to a combination of diet and exercise - including pole dancing			2
@entity16 said : ' i hope my story stops other pregnant women from making the same mistake			1
when i was pregnant , i happily indulged all my cravings because i was " eating for two "			2
new hobby : @entity16 has toned up using pole - dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on big loser : while she feels that ' eating for two ' ruined her post-pregnancy , slowly , the weight came off and @entity16 is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb ' i ignored how big i was getting but as soon as my baby was born , reality hit			1
' not only was i still huge after having her but also she was much bigger than expected which meant i could n’t have the birth i wanted and needed surgery after delivery			2
' i spent my pregnancy gorging on biscuits and crisps , and my baby suffered			2
i could n’t believe how stupid i had been			2
' @entity16 was a size 12 when she and husband @entity64 , 29 , started trying for baby number two in 2010			1
they already had a son , @entity67 , three , and @entity16 had sailed through her first pregnancy			1
but it was a different story when she fell pregnant again in april 2010			2
days before her three - month scan was due , @entity16 suffered a bleed and was taken to hospital			1
it was confirmed she was miscarrying her baby			2
comfort eating : after falling pregnant again after a miscarriage , @entity16 was so happy , relieved and excited that she stopped focusing on maintaining her trimmer weight the devastated mother took comfort in food			1
she said : ' i was so crushed i just did n’t care about my diet or myself			0
i ate whatever i wanted , when i wanted and told myself it was ok because i would be pregnant again soon			0
' @entity16 piled on two stone in as many months			1
but there was no time to worry about it before she learned she was expecting again			0
' i was so happy , relieved and excited to be pregnant again that i did n’t care about the weight gain			0
all i cared about was my baby			0
' i constantly craved chocolate — from bars to biscuits , cakes and milkshakes — so i ate everything i fancied and made sure there was a constant supply			0
when you are expecting , nobody bats an eyelid if you buy piles of chocolate — in fact , people smile and tell you to enjoy it			0
' problems and complications : her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool as @entity16 ’s pregnancy progressed , midwives gently reminded her about the importance of healthy eating			1
but the stretchy waistband on her maternity gear offered no real warnings as to how big she was really getting			0
she said : ' if i craved a bag of crisps i would think nothing of eating four bags in one go			0
all i could see was my bump growing and my husband was constantly telling me how gorgeous i was , so i did n’t worry			0
' at seven months she was struck by a pregnancy - related mobility condition called @entity127 ( @entity127 )			2
excessive weight gain is a major contributing factor			0
it left @entity16 almost bedbound and she simply ate more			1
trim and toned : without her baby bump for comfort , @entity16 suddenly felt conscious of her weight and has now slimmed down by the time she was due to give birth in april 2011 , @entity16 weighed 19st			1
at just 5ft 4in , she was wearing size 24 maternity clothing			0
her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool			2
happy and healthy : @entity16 is now happy and healthy at size 12 and there was another shock in store for @entity16 after an agonising six - hour labour			1
' there were gasps from the midwives and when i saw @entity19 , i realised why			0
she was beautiful but she was huge			0
she was almost twice the size of some newborns and looked more like a three - month - old baby , ' said @entity16			1
without her baby bump for comfort , @entity16 suddenly felt conscious of her weight			1
' i weighed myself when i got home and was shocked to see i was still 18st 2lb			2
suddenly i did n’t feel blooming			0
i felt sickened , ashamed and plain fat , ' she said			0
@entity16 ’s husband urged her to see her gp for help but she was too embarrassed			1
' i did n’t have the courage to walk in and say i was having panic attacks and agoraphobia because i ate too much when i was pregnant			1
' instead she decided to lose the weight alone			0
in august 2011 she joined a slimming club and started following a healthy eating plan			0
she said : ' it was hard after eating non-stop in my pregnancy but the group meetings kept me focused and i made sure i was always full up on salad and vegetables			2
' slowly , the weight came off and @entity16 is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb			1
she ’s toned up using pole - dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on			0
she added : ' the weight took months to go on and almost two years to come off			0
' " eating for two " ruined what should have been the happiest time with my newborn — and i ’ve spent the last two years paying for it			0
' breakfast : buttered white toast x @entity189 : creamy soup , large buttered @entity192 : creamy pasta , cheese , garlic @entity196 : chocolate bar and @entity199 : six packets of crisps , a @entity203 fruit and nut chocolate bar and chocolate @entity204 : @entity207 and chocolate milkshake breakfast : @entity211 yogurt and melon lunch : feta cheese salad with light dressing and yogurt dinner : healthy roast , @entity218 with lots of veg and boiled potatoes snacks : @entity223			0
