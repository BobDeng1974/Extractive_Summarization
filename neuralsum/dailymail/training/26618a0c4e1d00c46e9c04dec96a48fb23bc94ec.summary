there is n’t a single country in the world where a woman can earn as much as a man for doing the same job and it is likely to be another 81 years before that gender gap closes , according to a new report by the @entity9			1
in the @entity13 , the wage gap between men and women closed by just one percent in the past year to 66 percent - ‘ meaning that women earn about two - thirds of what men earn for similar work according to the perception of business leaders , ’ said @entity9 economist and report author @entity21			1
@entity13 did however move up three places to 20th on the overall annual gender equality list which also looked at health , education and political participation in 142 countries			1
cheer up ! the @entity9 predicts that woman could enjoy true parity with men before the end of the century @entity33 topped the list for the sixth year running , while @entity35 finished last			2
the @entity37 states all topped the list , with @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 following @entity33 in the top five			0
@entity43 came into the rankings for the first time and took seventh place , making it the highest - ranking @entity48 economy			0
the @entity13 inched up three places to 20 thanks to wage gaps having narrowed and the percentage of women in political and ministerial - level positions improving			1
@entity33 topped the annual @entity55 for the sixth year running , while @entity35 finished last @entity56 said @entity43 's success was because there are almost as many women as @entity31 - and in the country 's ministerial offices - rather than because of improved access to health and education services			0
@entity65 rose to become the sixth - best place for women ( up from 10 last year )			0
the @entity68 remained the highest - ranking @entity70 state , but fell from fifth to ninth place			0

the @entity13 ranked 20th overall , going as high as 4th for economic opportunity but as low as 62nd for health and survival			1
