the tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important , and that the user may have missed since they last logged in			1

@entity0 has started to roll out its ‘ while you were away ’ feature ( example pictured ) , which offers some users of the social network a selection of important tweets that may have missed since they last logged in the feature was spotted by a number of users over @entity29			1
it works in a similar way to @entity17 ’s news feed feature , which ranks status updates in terms of importance , instead of in chronological order			1
the @entity17 tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the @entity0 update is likely to cause similar frustrations			1
the site did not reveal how it prioritises tweets , or what it considers ' important '			1
@entity0 announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in november , stating at the time : ‘ every time you open the @entity0 app , you ’ll see something great			1
’ it added : ‘ we can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. ’ the best tweets are displayed at the top of a user ’s timeline when they open the app ( pictured ) or website - a new feature , which has delighted some , while annoying others who took to @entity0 to complain it works in a similar way to @entity17 ’s top stories news feed feature , which ranks status updates in terms of importance , instead of in chronological order ( pictured )			1
the @entity17 tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear in november @entity0 revealed its plans for the ‘ while you were away ’ feature			1
here is what it said in a blog post : ' right now , what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow , and that ’s a great model for many people			0
' but with that many tweets every day , there ’s no way even the most avid @entity0 user will find everything that ’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment			1
' that ’s why we ’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on @entity0 all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real - time nature of the platform that makes @entity0 special			2
' for instance , we ’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to @entity0 for : a snapshot of what ’s happening			0
' we can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. ' we ’re also working on ideas such as an instant , personalised timeline for new users who do n’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own			0
' now , it appears that more and more users are seeing the ‘ while you were away ’ changes , with some noticing the new feature in early december , @entity124 reported			0
it is the first major new feature rolled out by the company , based in @entity131 , @entity132 , since it launched promoted tweets and adverts , which also buck its chronological approach			0
@entity0 declined to comment when @entity137 asked when all users will see the update , and if it will be an optional feature			0
the tool is designed to attract a user 's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information , especially if they follow hundreds of people , or do not check their feed very regularly			1
a staggering 500 million tweets are published every day			0
people reacted on @entity0 to the change , with some pouring scorn on the new feature			0
one user wrote : ' @entity0 new feature to tell me what happened while i was away			2
i was away because i did n't want to know anything ' , while another said : ‘ why does @entity0 show me tweets from last night " while you were away "			2
’ however , one @entity164 user was among many who praised the change , saying : ‘ love the ' while you were away ' feature at @entity0			2
achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed ! ’ the new feature may be seen as a move by @entity0 to close in on @entity17 ’s social media lead , which has 1.3 billion users , compared to @entity0 ’s 284 million			1
@entity0 is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘ instant timeline ’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year			2
last year , @entity179 leapfrogged @entity0 to become the third most used social media app ( pictured )			0

@entity17 still reigns as the most popular , however , with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it , closely followed by @entity190 with 43 per cent			0
@entity179 's popularity is growing among 25 to 34 - year - olds , and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the younger age group			0
