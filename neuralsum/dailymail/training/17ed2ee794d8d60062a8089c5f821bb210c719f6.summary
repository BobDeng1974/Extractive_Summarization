by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 05:42 est , 7 january 2014 catholic groups are up in arms with @entity4 , president @entity5 's flagship healthcare program , claiming that the government is ' blind ' to the full implications of the contraceptive mandate			1
catholic groups - led by the @entity10 - are currently challenging the contraceptive mandate of the @entity4 in the @entity12			1
the groups say the @entity4 requirement for group health plans to provide contraception violates their religious beliefs			1
claims : the @entity10 say the @entity20 government is ' blind ' to the real implications of the contraceptive mandate ( library image ) on @entity25 justice @entity24 granted a temporary injunction which meant the group - and others - can opt out while the challenge continues			1
however , the government says the injunction should never have been granted as such groups are already exempt through an ' accommodation '			1
under an accommodation , religious non-profits sign a form which means contraception is administered - and paid for - through a third party organization			2
the administration adds the @entity39 are also part of the @entity41 - which also exempts them			2
but @entity43 argue they can not sign away the responsibility to administer contraception to a third party - as they would then be sinning of their behalf			1
@entity48 , a lawyer for the @entity39 , says the government is ' simply blind to the religious exercise at issue : the @entity39 and other applicants can not execute the form because they can not deputize a third party to sin on their behalf			2
' in court papers , he says the government ’s ' causal dismissal ' of that ' religiously forbidden act as a mere " stroke of their own pen " perpetuates their claim below that the @entity39 are fighting an ‘ invisible dragon			0
' another lawyer for the nuns , @entity65 of the @entity67 writes , ' the government ’s incomplete characterization of the form is that it is a simple opt - out form that does nothing but signal that the organization is claiming an exemption			0
' refute : the government say @entity76 groups are already exempt from administering - and paying for - contraception ( library image ) however , professor @entity79 of @entity80 says groups are wrong			1
speaking with @entity82 , he claims the @entity39 ' emphasis on the form is misguided			0
' i would say that even if the consequence of signing the paper were that the employees get contraceptive coverage , that still would not count as a substantial burden under the @entity91			0
' suppose that a quaker who is categorically opposed to war gets a draft notice			0
if the @entity98 plaintiffs are right , then he is not only entitled to his exemption from the draft ; he ’s entitled to get his exemption without even signing the piece of paper saying he is entitled to his exemption			0
why ? because if he signs that piece of paper , then the government will draft the next person on the list and so he will be ' participating ' in the war effort to which he is religiously opposed			0
' the @entity39 could be granted to opt out by the @entity12 at any time .			0
