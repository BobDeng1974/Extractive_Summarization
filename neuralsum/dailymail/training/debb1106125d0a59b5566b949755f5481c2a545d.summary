by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 last night told other @entity4 leaders he was ‘ completely unapologetic ’ about refusing to back @entity5 for @entity7 ’s top job as it emerged there have been secret talks over the candidate ’s drinking and smoking habits			1
@entity7 diplomats claimed mr @entity5 ‘ chain - smoked ’ his way through one meeting yesterday and was attempting to have a smoking ban in the @entity16 in @entity17 lifted before he has even been appointed			2
but now several @entity4 leaders are understood to have discussed allegations that the former @entity24 prime minister is a heavy drinker during talks on who should become president of the @entity29			1
the row over @entity7 ’s leadership , expected to end in humiliation for mr @entity2 at a @entity17 summit today , has plunged @entity63 ’s relationship with the rest of the @entity4 into deep crisis			1
mr @entity2 will today warn his @entity4 counterparts that the appointment of mr @entity5 , whom he considers an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform , risks pushing the @entity63 closer to the @entity4 exit door			1
he also rejected last - ditch attempts by @entity34 chancellor @entity33 to persuade him to cave in and not force the appointment of mr @entity5 to a vote , saying there would be ‘ consequences ’ if @entity63 is overruled			2
yesterday he vowed to fight ' until the end ' the appointment of a man seen by the @entity63 as a roadblock to reform			0
@entity82 and the @entity83 have publicly supported the @entity84 in insisting mr @entity5 is the wrong man for the job			2
@entity86 argues that the decision should have been taken between @entity4 leaders , and not imposed by the @entity89 – the largest group in the @entity57			2
mr @entity2 is expected to force an unprecedented vote on mr @entity5 ’s appointment , leaving other leaders to have to justify their decision			1
the row threatens to overshadow a gathering of @entity4 leaders at the highly symbolic venue of @entity46 to mark the 100th anniversary of the @entity45			1
@entity86 argues @entity5 's appointment has been forced by parties in the @entity57 , and not mutual agreement between elected heads of government @entity2 speaks with @entity104 prime minister @entity103 - with whom he famously posed for a ' selfie ' with during @entity107 's memorial service mr @entity2 and ms @entity103 - who is the daughter - in - law of former @entity82 leader @entity109 - appeared to be engaged in animated conversation after paying respect to the memory of the dead with a minute 's silence , mr @entity2 faces an awkward dinner with mrs @entity33 and other leaders with whom he has very publicly rowed			1
as the events got underway , mr @entity2 told reporters : ‘ ' i am completely unapologetic about standing up for an important principle in @entity7 , which is that the elected heads of government should make these choices , ' he said			2
' i am also unapologetic about the need for people to carry forward badly - needed reform in @entity7 and there will be a vote tomorrow and we 'll see the outcome of that vote			0
‘ it 's absolutely vital people know that with me you get what i said i 'm going to do in @entity7			0
' the bitter row has exposed the dire relations between @entity137 and many other @entity7 capitals , with the @entity84 coming closing to accusing other leaders of lying about their support for mr @entity5			1
in an apparent swipe at some of his fellow leaders , who are reported to have voiced unease with mr @entity5 's candidacy in private talks , mr @entity2 said : ' it 's very important in @entity7 , that you say what you say in private , and it 's the same as what you say in public			1
' there is growing speculation that mr @entity2 will threaten defeat over the @entity29 presidency would make a @entity63 exit from the @entity4 more likely in the referendum he is planning for 2017			2
mr @entity2 added : ‘ my message to my fellow heads of government and heads of state is that this approach that they are contemplating taking is the wrong approach for @entity7			2
' they are about to take what i think is the wrong step			0
so i will make that argument , i will stick to my guns , i will stick to my principles , i will insist on that vote			0
we will have to wait and see what actually happens in that vote			0
@entity34 chancellor @entity33 has tried to play down the consequences of a failure to find consensus on the presidency			0
' it would not be a drama if we voted with a qualified majority only , ' she said			0
@entity34 chancellor @entity33 has insisted it would ' not be a drama ' if mr @entity2 forces the issue to a vote			0
they are pictured at the @entity35 with @entity32 president @entity31 @entity2 , left , speaks with @entity31 during the ceremony			0
but he faces an awkward dinner with other @entity4 leaders over the issue the @entity7 heads of states attend the ceremony marking the centenary of the outbreak of @entity45 to mark the occasion , the @entity4 donated a symbolic bench with bronzed copper plates reading the word ' peace ' in the @entity4 's 24 official languages @entity104 prime minister @entity103 ( front ) plants a porcelain flower at the ' peace bench ' ahead of @entity2 , @entity206 federal chancellor @entity205 , @entity208 prime minister @entity207 , @entity210 prime minister @entity209 , and @entity34 federal chancellor @entity33 ' but - and i have also stressed this again and again before - all consultations are carried out within a @entity7 spirit and the concerns of all member states taken seriously			1
' and @entity210 , which had initially expressed reservations about mr @entity5 's candidacy , has now indicated that it will not block his nomination			2
@entity210 finance minister @entity220 told the @entity221 : ' i think it 's quite clear that there is an overwhelming support for @entity5 as the head of the @entity29			0
' it 's a key interest for @entity210 , but also for @entity34 and the @entity227 and many other @entity7 countries to keep the @entity63 in the @entity4 , so we could have seen strong arguments for listening to @entity2 when he raised this			1
@entity34 chancellor @entity33 arrives , at the @entity232 for the @entity234 meeting in @entity46 ' but now we are in a position where it is quite clear that there is overwhelming support , so we have to accept that			0
' @entity82 said mr @entity2 had mishandled the issue			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity241 told the @entity243 4 today programme : ' sadly , the handling of these negotiations have turned a @entity7 divided over @entity5 into a @entity7 apparently united against @entity2			1
' ' my personal judgment is he was too public , too personal in his attacks , too early , with the result that public criticism got confused with private influence , ' said mr @entity241			0
business secretary @entity252 has also claimed mr @entity2 's robust opposition to mr @entity5 becoming president of the @entity29 ' has not helped @entity63 punch its weight in @entity7 '			1
meanwhile , the prime minister believes he can ‘ dodge ’ holding an in / out @entity4 referendum in 2017 , a senior @entity256 warned last night			1
@entity259 , former aide to education secretary @entity260 , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s inner circle thinks he can still dodge the bullet of a referendum , though if he tries his party may send in a firing squad			0
