criticism : @entity1 , the @entity2 business secretary , blasted the @entity4 plans to make it harder to call industrial action @entity7 last night descended into open warfare after @entity4 plans to curb public sector strikes were condemned by @entity2 as a ‘ brutal bid to strangle workers ’ rights ’			1
@entity1 , the @entity2 business secretary , blasted the @entity4 plans to make it harder to call industrial action if it would affect health services , transport , fire or schools			1
while under the current laws a strike can be called if it is backed by a simple majority of those balloted , under the new @entity4 plan the backing of 40 per cent of eligible union members would be required			1
mr @entity1 – who last week defied his leader @entity27 ’s attempt to remove him as the party ’s lead spokesman on the economy during the election – condemned the move as ‘ entirely ideologically - led ’			1
he said : ‘ setting a mandatory 40 per cent level of support for strike action seems odd when mps do not need to reach such a high hurdle to get elected			0
there ’s no doubt these ill - conceived @entity4 plans wouldf have major implications for other democratic elections , from @entity43 to police commissioners			2
‘ industrial relations in the @entity46 are good and the conservatives would do well to turn their attention to creating a fairer society			0
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ these conservative proposals are ... a brutal attempt to strangle the basic rights of working people in this country			1
’ the ‘ 40 per cent ’ rule , which will form part of the @entity58 manifesto , was raised yesterday by transport secretary @entity59 , who said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ that a planned @entity62 bus strike later this month had been voted for by only 16 per cent of people entitled to take part in the ballot			0
‘ i think before a strike is allowed to go ahead it must have much more support from the union members and can not be called by politicised union leaders , ’ mr @entity59 said			1
mr @entity1 last week defied his leader @entity27 ’s attempt to remove him as the party ’s lead spokesman on the economy the proposed changes were immediately condemned by @entity77 general secretary @entity76 , who said they would have a ‘ chilling ’ effect , while @entity81 general secretary @entity80 even invoked this year ’s 800th anniversary of @entity83 to condemn the ‘ anti-democratic ’ crackdown			1
she said : ‘ these attacks are not worthy of the government – they ’re being launched in the year we celebrate @entity83 , for goodness sake			0
’ with the general election now just four months away , the conservatives and @entity2 members of the @entity92 are keen to ‘ differentiate ’ their political differences to appeal to their core voter base			0
the row between mr @entity1 and mr @entity27 came after the deputy prime minister announced on wednesday that mr @entity1 will lead on business policy during the campaign – a blow to mr cable who led on the economy at the 2010 election			2
mr @entity27 said that chief secretary to the treasury @entity105 ( @entity106 ) would replace mr @entity1 ( r ) as the lead economic spokesman , including in any televised debates mr @entity27 said that chief secretary to the treasury @entity105 would replace mr @entity1 as the lead economic spokesman , including in any televised debates			0
however , mr @entity1 insisted that he was going nowhere , and dismissed the matter as a ‘ minor internal question ’			2
when @entity4 mp @entity113 said during a @entity115 debate that he had been ‘ removed as the economic spokesman for your party at the @entity93 ’ , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ well , i actually remain as our economic spokesman but that ’s a minor internal question			1
’ but a spokesman for mr @entity105 later said : ‘ @entity105 has been appointed as the economics spokesman by @entity27			0
’ a source close to mr @entity1 then said : ‘ he remains economic spokesperson but @entity105 is also an economic spokesperson			2
’ the two men are said by sources to be barely on speaking terms .			0
