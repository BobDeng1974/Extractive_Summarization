to play for @entity1 at @entity2 , @entity0 will fly 500 miles			1
then add a zero on the end			1
when @entity6 ’s visit to the new home of @entity8 ended in defeat on sunday night , the 32 - year - old confronted the reality of life in @entity12			1
a 5,000 mile journey from @entity14 to @entity15 , lasting the best part of a day , for a midweek friendly with @entity18 followed by a @entity20 qualifier against @entity21			1
the crowds for both games will be modest			1
@entity0 made the 5,000 mile trip from @entity26 to @entity15 in order to represent his country @entity1 international @entity0 , pictured scoring against the @entity30 , loves playing for his country @entity1 are just three points behind @entity33 leaders @entity34 in the race to qualify for @entity36 yet it only took a five - minute call to @entity39 to convince him the jetlag was worth it			1
that the arrangement can work			2
‘ we had a conversation , which was pretty brief , ’ said the man whose stunning goal against @entity45 invigorated @entity1 ’s latest qualifying campaign			1
‘ but although it was brief , it was really important for me			2
‘ i asked him if it would have any detrimental effect on my international career ( moving to the @entity55 ) and he said , “ no ”			2
that was all i needed to know			2
‘ i absolutely love playing for my country			2
it makes me very , very proud and it ’s an honour to do it and i will try my hardest to continue to make the squad no matter what league i am in			1
’ how he might feel when the air miles mount is another matter			2
significantly easier ways to add more caps to the display cabinet			2
leaving troubled , relegation threatened @entity72 in january , there was a firm offer from @entity74			1
speaking during @entity77 ’s winter break to @entity78 , @entity75 had also expressed an interest in taking him back to @entity80			2
‘ i think the quotes by the @entity77 manager were just him being very polite about me as a player , ’ claimed @entity0			1
‘ i was a previous @entity77 player			2
i did n’t think there was too much else in it			2
‘ there were options to stay in @entity89 , but i spoke to the manager and the owner in @entity26 and i think my mind was pretty much made up in january			1
@entity0 rejected interest from @entity89 and @entity1 in order to seal a move to @entity12 outfit @entity6 ‘ you have to respect any club that offers you a contract in @entity89 or @entity1			1
but i really wanted to try this			2
’ he had been around the block in @entity89 and @entity1 many times			1
two spells at @entity77 left nothing new to discover , other than a landscape with no @entity104 games			2
at @entity105 and @entity72 , he had also been seen the contrasts of @entity89 football , winning an @entity109 medal before flirting with a relegation battle in the @entity111			1
a £ 750,000 move to @entity74 was close , but fell down			2
@entity26 ’s @entity113 and @entity114 were always appealing options			2
‘ i have always thought about playing in this league , ’ he continued			0
‘ i think the timing just worked			0
it ’s a completely different lifestyle , everything is new			0
the stadiums , the clubs i am playing against , everything			0
it ’ s all very exciting			0
‘ we had a disappointing year as a club last season and the play - offs are our ambition this year			1
i do n’t think it ’s beyond us			0
’ the early signs suggest otherwise			0
after three matches , @entity0 has yet to play in a winning team and crossing the @entity133 to face @entity18 in a friendly is a big commitment			1
without a point in the @entity142 , fire host @entity140 hours after @entity1 ’s qualifier with @entity21 on sunday without one of their prized , high - profile designated players			1
caught between a rock and a hard place , @entity0 insisted : ‘ i will always make myself available for @entity1			1
@entity0 ( left , pictured with @entity145 ) is pleased to be playing under @entity1 boss @entity39 ‘ we will cross the friendlies bridge as we come to it			1
’ his respect for the manager is a factor			0
effusive in his praise of @entity39 , his former @entity77 manager , @entity0 has new enthusiasm for international football , admitting : ‘ look , the manager has been excellent			1
‘ i would n’t want to disrespect @entity157 the previous manager at all			0
but the impact @entity39 has had has been monumental			0
‘ the players have bought into the system that he wants and we have some outstanding players in @entity163 and @entity145 at @entity164			0
‘ i would probably put @entity165 in that same category and then beyond that our manager is our biggest asset			0
we are very fortunate to have him			0
’ asked if this is the best @entity1 team in 20 years or so he is blunt			1
technically , there have been better players in dark blue			0
yet @entity39 ’s organisational skills and tactical nous are doing a decent job of covering up the cracks on the surface			0
‘ individually , we have probably had better players – or players playing at a higher level and more of them , ’ he said			0
‘ but as a group and as a team there is a feeling about it i have n’t had in quite a long time			0
@entity1 are currently preparing for their upcoming matches against @entity18 and @entity21 ‘ we are a good side			1
we played very well against @entity45 and were brought down to earth a little bit against @entity89			0
‘ but we have to realise what our strengths are and our weaknesses and try to get better			0
‘ @entity195 are still favourites to qualify			0
@entity34 second and after that it ’s between us , @entity18 and @entity198 for a spot in the top two and if not third and a play - off			1
‘ @entity1 against @entity45 in @entity202 is a big , big game and the result will have big ramifications for the group – as any game does now			1
‘ @entity45 are strong at home and @entity34 were very good in @entity209 , as well			0
‘ i could n’t call it , i really could n’t			0
’ there was a brief exchange with @entity8 ’s @entity15 - born coach @entity213 before the long journey home			1
@entity215 found the travel from @entity217 in @entity219 gruelling			0
@entity26 is less northerly when it comes to flying to venues like @entity14 , yet @entity8 was still a 4,000 mile round trip			1
‘ you never know where and when things can change in this game , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i ’ve only spent a short time in @entity26 , but it ’s a great sporting city , it is going to be a massive lifestyle change and i am looking forward to it			0
‘ i want to be part of a team which makes the city proud			0
and an international team that makes the country proud			0
