when @entity3 @entity2 became stranded in a @entity5 desert with a badly damaged car , his ordeal was one which would have left most men helpless and desperate			1
but after his @entity10 car ground to a halt , the enterprising electrician would not be denied in his quest to find his way back to civilisation			1
his amazing escape from the barren terrain saw mr @entity2 singlehandedly rebuild his citreon into a makeshift motorbike , in a dramatic escape which has seen him dubbed the most ' extreme ' mechanic in the world			1
stranded : mr @entity2 had found himself 20 miles from the nearest village , but slept under his car 's body while converting the rest of the vehicle into a motorbike finished product : his amazing makeshift motorbike made from the car 's remaining parts allowed mr @entity2 to travel to civilisation , where he was rescued by police his ingenious engineering saw him convert the car 's rear bumper into a rudimentary seat , shorten the chassis , and place the engine and gearbox in the middle to create a vehicle which somehow kept going long enough to transport him to safety			1
the 43 - year - old had been driving his @entity46 across the desert from the @entity5 city of @entity49			1
however , along the way he was stopped at a military outpost and was informed that he could n't go any further			0
faced with prospect of returning to @entity49 , @entity2 decided instead to go off road to navigate around the restricted area			2
unfortunately the rocky and bumpy terrain soon caused problems and he lost control of his car before crashing into a rock			0
the impact caused the @entity10 's swing arm and wheel axle to snap - leaving the car undriveable			1
preserved : mr @entity2 , now 62 , has kept the motorbike as a memento of his incredible escape from the @entity5 desert with the nearest village at least 20 miles away , @entity2 did n't feel he would be able to make it on foot			1
luckily , he had a small cache of supplies , water for several days and a few tools , including a hacksaw			0
after considering his options , @entity2 decided that his best course of action was to use parts from his car to create a makeshift motorbike			1
mr @entity2 told the @entity82 : ' i wanted to do it off road because i had travelled round @entity85 about 10 times , so i knew the region well and therefore had no concerns			2
' i decided to do it in a @entity46 because , although it is not a 4x4 , it is tough			0
in @entity85 they call it the ‘ @entity97 ’ because it goes everywhere — provided you drive it gently			0
one must not be rough			0
' i obviously was too rough because i broke it			0
' i could not have gone back on foot — it was too far			0
i put myself in what one calls survival mode			0
i ate less ; i monitored my supplies of water and of food to make them last as long as possible			0
' he started by removing the @entity10 's body , which he then used as a shelter to sleep under			1
to build the bike he shortened the car 's chassis before reattaching the axles and two of the wheels , as well as installing the engine and gearbox in the middle			1
he had thought that it would take him just a few days to construct the motorcycle , but in the end it took 12			2
recovery : mr @entity2 's amazing extreme mechanic story happened in 1993 , but has only just come to light heroic deeds : mr @entity2 's exploits have seen him compared to @entity130 , the character in @entity131 ( played by @entity132 ) , who was known for his ingenious engineering ability eventually , however , it was complete and , with just half a litre of water left , @entity2 started his ride back to civilisation			2
the going was easy and he regularly fell off the seat , which was made from part of the car 's rear bumper			1
after a day of riding @entity2 was picked up by the @entity5 police who drove him to the nearest village			1
they also handed him a hefty fine because the registration documents for his car no longer corresponded to what he was driving			0
@entity2 's extraordinary tale has only just come to light after appearing on the internet and quickly going viral			2
although his story appeared in brief on @entity3 television in the 1990s , mr @entity2 did not publicise his exploits , and they only recently emerged again after appearing on a motoring website			2
mr @entity2 , now 62 and living in northwest @entity3 , has been likened to action hero @entity130 and his superhero @entity131 , who was known for his ingenious engineering ability .			0

@entity2 broke @entity10 in @entity5 desert 20 miles from nearest village
he engineered own rescue by rebuilding the damaged car into a motorbike
his *hastily* - made vehicle included the car 's bumper as a seat
he put car 's engine and gearbox in middle of vehicle and shortened chassis in rebuilding job which took 12 days
