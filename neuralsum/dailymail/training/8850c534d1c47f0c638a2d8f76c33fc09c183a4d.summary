vice president @entity0 is famous for his off - beat humor , but when he swore in the new @entity3 on tuesday his jokes took on a remarkably creepier tone			1
when introduced to @entity7 senator @entity6 's teenage granddaughter @entity5 , @entity0 commented : ' i hope you have a big fence around the house ! ' the comment was made as @entity0 posed with the 80 - year - old @entity15 senator 's large family , on the day he officially became president pro tempore of @entity3			1
@entity0 thought the joke about the girl 's good looks so funny , he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman senator @entity22			1
pictures from the event show @entity0 with his arm around the @entity15 's daughter @entity26 , as senator @entity22 placeh her hand on a @entity29 to be sworn in			1
he probably wo n't be calling senator @entity22 up for favors anytime soon			0
in addition to the strange comment towards her daughter , @entity0 also got the senator 's name wrong at first - calling @entity22 by her husband 's name , @entity39			2
stale jokes : @entity0 later used the same line when he freshman senator @entity22 's ( in red ) teenage daughter @entity26 ( left ) getting close : @entity0 was pictured with his arm around @entity26 as her mother was sworn in			1
the vp probably did n't make a great impression on @entity22 , since he called her by her husband 's name - @entity39 ( in red tie ) - when they met on tuesday @entity0 's blush - worthy moments did n't end there			0
excruciatingly awkward @entity55 footage shows the moment he leaned in to kiss the red - headed daughter of senator @entity58 of @entity59 ... and got rejected			2
throughout the rest of the day , @entity0 continued to throw out flattery left and right			0
' as they say in southern @entity59 , " boy , you married up , " ' he told the husband of @entity64 republican @entity63			0
@entity0 likely felt free to let out these more casual comments since he spent more than three decades in the @entity69			0
pained : after posing with the family of senator @entity58 of @entity59 ( left ) , @entity0 leaned down to whisper something to @entity58 ' daughter @entity72			2
she did not seem to enthused by what he had to say turned away : perhaps the most excruciatingly awkward part of the ceremony was when @entity0 tried to kiss @entity58 ' daughter @entity77 on the head and she turned away			0

as @entity69 president , @entity0 was *responsible* for *swearing* in the new @entity3 on tuesday and got to meet many of their family *members*
the vp made a strange comment about the good looks of @entity69 president @entity87 @entity6 's teen granddaughter @entity5
repeated the same *compliment* to freshman senator @entity22 , about her teen daughter @entity26
video shows the moment he tried to kiss the daughter of @entity59 senator @entity58 on the head , and the girl shied away
