all in the taste : the world appears to have developed an almost ­ insatiable appetite for @entity3 devotees will tell you that it is delicious smeared over toast , sensational oozing out of pancakes , and the secret ingredient in one of the most delicious chocolate cakes known to man			1
half a century after it was invented in the back room of an @entity17 bakery , the world appears to have an almost ­ insatiable appetite for @entity3 , the hazelnut chocolate spread			1
last year addicts devoured a ­ staggering 365,000 tonnes of the stuff in 160 countries			2
@entity3 ’s @entity24 page has more than 26 million fans			1
in @entity27 sales have overtaken @entity28			1
with more than 11 million jars bought each year , it is now the most popular branded spread in the @entity27			1
if you ’ve never been that impressed with the sickly sweetness or high calorie count , the appeal of @entity3 can be hard to fathom			1
but for fans , the distinctive glass jar and plastic white lid instil the kind of brand loyalty that @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 can only dream about			2
so why does this sugary brown gloop , which this month celebrates its 50th birthday , inspire such devotion ? and how did such an unhealthy product become such a massive brand ? @entity3 may have been launched in 1964 , but it only began to make serious inroads into the @entity52 breakfast in the @entity53			1
before then chocolate spreads were runny , rather than thick and creamy , and flavoured overwhelmingly with cocoa			0
for those like me , raised in the @entity58 , chocolate spread — ­ particularly @entity61 ’s @entity60 — was a very occasional treat , saved for holidays or birthdays			2
many of us assumed that , like most such sugar - laden indulgences , it hailed from @entity70			2
in fact , the @entity71 , like @entity27 , was late to the party			1
success : it was n't until @entity76 ( pictured ) took over the running of the company that @entity3 took off internationally			1
his estimated wealth of $ 26billion makes him the 20th richest person in the world for the @entity3 story had started ­ decades before , in the lean months after the @entity87 when a young pastry maker from @entity85 , in the north of @entity17 , was looking for a way to compensate for a shortage of cocoa			1
@entity92 - heir to the @entity3 empire - died after suffering an apparent heart attack in 2011 his name was @entity92 and he began to experiment			1
the region specialised in ­ growing hazelnuts and @entity76 realised he could bulk out the cocoa with nut paste			0
his first contribution came in 1946 with a hard cocoa and hazelnut brick that had to be sliced with a knife			0
he named it giandujot after a famous ­ carnival figure of the time			0
a few years later , he found a way to add vegetable oil to the mix , creating a spreadable v ­ ersion called @entity3 — the forerunner of @entity3			1
making the nut and chocolate combination soft was key			0
now a little chocolate spread could go a long way			2
and crucially it could be spread on bread , a vital staple of the @entity17 diet			2
you might not have been able to afford chocolates in postwar @entity17 , but you could afford a taste of @entity3			1
in 1964 @entity3 turned into @entity3 , thanks to @entity92 ’s son , @entity127 , who improved the recipe and developed the ­ distinctive glass jar			1
the new name was an attempt to appeal to an international audience — nuts for an @entity135 coolness , and ‘ ella ’ to give it a soft , @entity17 ending			0
by 1966 it was on sale in @entity140 and @entity141 — and by 1977 production began in @entity143			0
today , around a quarter of all hazelnuts grown in the world end up in the spread			2
‘ they made such a blend , ­ people became crazy about it almost immediately , ’ says ­ @entity149 president @entity148			0
‘ it is something absolutely ­ fantastic because every time we enter a new market there is an immediate wave of interest for this product			0
we almost do n’t need to do anything			0
’ a jar is sold every 2.5 seconds globally			0
the company produces enough @entity3 each year to create a smear of spread that would circle the world 1.4 times			1
stacked up , the jars would build 22,000 @entity170			2
in the @entity27 alone sales are worth nearly £ 30 million a year — and rose last year by more than 22 per cent			1
part of its success is down to the way that the middle classes have embraced the product despite it being so obviously unhealthy			2
a @entity141 advert for @entity3 hazelnut spread from circa 1970			1
last year addicts devoured a ­ staggering 365,000 tonnes of the stuff in 160 countries			2
@entity3 's @entity24 page has more than 26 million fans @entity186 , the epitome of middle - class cooking , uses it in recipes for cheesecake and chocolate cake , a treat she describes as ‘ one of the most delicious cakes ’ she makes			1
meanwhile clever marketing means it was promoted from the very start as an everyday luxury , an affordable guilty pleasure			0
@entity76 also talked up @entity3 ’s naturalness and has suggested it can be part of a balanced breakfast , sometimes to the irritation of consumer groups			1
it ’s certainly true that it is mostly natural			0
a 750g jar ­ contains 97 hazelnuts , along with sugar , vegetable oil , cocoa and skimmed milk powder			0
it also has whey powder and soya lecithin to keep it glossy and creamy , along with a drop of vanilla flavouring			0
but healthy it is n’t			0
@entity3 was created in 1946 by @entity92 in the back room of his bakery in the small town of @entity221 in @entity85 , @entity17			1
with the help of his brother @entity223 , @entity92 initially sold the product locally in solid loaves that had to be sliced like bread			0
famed for the quality of the local chocolate and hazelnuts , residents in @entity221 quickly developed a taste for the product			0
but it was n't until @entity92 's eldest son @entity127 took over the running of @entity236 that the @entity3 product took off internationally			1
relaunching his father 's ' secret recipe ' in 1964 in its easy - to - spread form , @entity3 quickly changed the @entity17 thinking that chocolate was only to be eaten at @entity243 and @entity244			1
@entity127 's new recipe was fiercely guarded , with the company never holding a press conference or allowing media to visit a factory			0
however @entity3 marketing push has been far more out in the open - its sponsorship of the @entity17 national football team in the late 1990s helping to cement the link between @entity3 and @entity17 national pride			1
now , 50 years after it first created @entity3 , @entity236 produces a number of different products , including @entity257 and @entity236			1
one in four hazelnuts produced worldwide now end up in a @entity149 product			0
in 2008 @entity76 surpassed @entity260 as @entity17 's richest man , and his estimated wealth of $ 26billion also makes him the 20th richest person in the world			0
tragedy struck , however , when @entity127 's son @entity92 - who had taken over as @entity236 's ceo - died after suffering an apparent heart attack in @entity269 2011			2
the current heir of the dynasty is @entity272 's second son - the company 's acting ceo			2
more than half of @entity3 ( 56.7 per cent ) is pure sugar , while 30 per cent is fat			1
some of that is the fat found in hazelnuts , but around 20 per cent of the spread is semi-solid palm oil			1
just 13 per cent is hazelnuts			2
its makeup — in terms of cocoa , sugar and fat — is almost identical to chocolate			0
despite the hazelnuts , there are n’t many healthy nutrients			0
­ claiming it ’s good for you is like arguing that you get some of your five a day by eating ­ @entity61 ’s @entity295			0
in comparison with other breakfast spreads it does badly , too			0
peanut butter has more protein , less unhealthy fat and more vitamins			2
and while jam and honey are 60 to 70 per cent pure sugar , they do n’t have the fat			0
eating @entity3 is comparable to having a layer of golden syrup topped with peanut butter			1
and there are 100 calories in one tablespoon			0
you ’d need to walk briskly for half an hour to burn that one spoonful off			0
@entity3 got into trouble with the @entity316 a few years ago after claiming ‘ we want all our kids to have a balanced breakfast ’ and implying that each 400g jar ­ contained 52 hazelnuts , skimmed milk , cocoa powder — and nothing else			1
the @entity316 ruled that the advert exaggerated the health benefits			0
but those criticisms have been shrugged off by fans and by the parent company @entity236 , the world ’s fourth largest chocolate maker which also sells @entity236 , @entity331 and those @entity257 truffles supposedly so beloved of ambassadors			2
for them @entity3 is big ­ business — sales make up a fifth of @entity76 ’s annual £ 6.5 billion turnover			1
today the company employs 30,000 people and has 20 ­ factories around the world			0
its reclusive 89 - year - old owner , @entity76 , is worth £ 15 billion — making him the richest person in @entity17 and , according to @entity345 , the 21st richest man in the world			1
the @entity3 bandwagon shows no signs of slowing			2
@entity76 has opened @entity351 in ­ @entity352 and @entity354 selling pastries and treats featuring the spread			0
such is the ­ popularity and pride in its home country that the @entity17 postal service issued a @entity3 stamp earlier this month to mark the 50th anniversary			1
the company also celebrated the day with street parties throughout @entity365 and a pop concert in @entity367			0
it may be sickly sweet , unhealthy and terrible for your teeth and waistline			0
but the popularity of @entity3 just keeps on ( ahem ) spreading .			1

@entity3 has 26 million fans on @entity24 and sells *11million* jars annually
in @entity27 alone sales of the spread are up by 22 per cent year - on - year
but experts are *warning* that despite its popularity the spread is unhealthy
