a remarkable video has emerged purporting to show @entity2 militants chatting casually with a group of @entity5 border guards near the besieged @entity7 city of @entity8			1
the amateur footage , understood to have been filmed close to @entity10 in the outskirts of @entity8 , raises serious questions about the apparently relaxed relationship between the terror group and officials from the @entity17 member state			1
it appears to show two heavily armed militants wandering nonchalantly up to the @entity5 border fence - displaying shocking bravado as they smile and wave at the camera			1
they are met by what appears to be a military vehicle full of security officials who , despite carrying weapons themselves , do little more than break into conversation with the jihadis , who eventually wander off back into @entity7 while shouting ' @entity30 '			1
the footage has not been independently verified			0
the clip begins with the two apparent jihadists lighting fires near a group of cars , which are believed to have been abandoned by desperate @entity50 families who fled @entity8 in recent weeks when @entity52 militants stepped up their attacks on the city			1
after appearing to realise they are being filmed from inside @entity5 , the pair start walking towards the border fence , stopping only to mockingly wave at the amateur filmmaker			2
as they reach the border fence , an armoured military vehicle belonging to @entity5 border guards speeds up to meet them			1
heavily armed officials jump out the back of the car and - after briefly talking on their radios , simply engage the men in conversation			2
at one point the situation appears tense and a border guard scampers towards the militants with his gun briefly raised , but he stops seconds later and also begins talking to the men			0
after several minutes chatting , the militants wander off , defiantly raising their index finger to the sky to represent jihadism while chanting ' @entity30 ' - a phrase that translates as ' @entity83 is the greatest '			1

just over a week ago militants shot and wounded a senior @entity7 rebel commander @entity105 in a bungled kidnapping in the southeastern @entity5 town of @entity108			2
previously @entity102 drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help @entity50 fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in @entity8			1
there are also serious questions over why @entity5 has allowed thousands of @entity117 jihadists - who enter the country on budget airlines in tourist resorts - to easily pass over the border into @entity7 to join @entity52 fighters there			1
@entity5 has long argued that @entity52 does not have a presence in the country			2
others claim small cells are able to operate in southern @entity5 towns , easily popping over the border to fight in @entity7 before returning home to @entity5			2
there are even claims from those on the ground that wounded @entity52 militants are routinely smuggled from the frontline to receive treatment in @entity5 hospitals , which are better equipped and less - stretched than those in northern @entity7			1
@entity5 has also been accused of allowing up to 3,000 detained @entity117 jihadists to rejoin the @entity2 in @entity7 in return for the release 49 diplomats who had been held prisoner by the terrorists			0

the photograph was taken from over the border in @entity5 , with a @entity5 farmer continuing to go about his business in the foreground experts believe @entity5 's reluctance to fully commit to the fight against @entity52 is two-fold			1
firstly the brave @entity50 fighters battling @entity52 in northern @entity7 have links to the @entity173 - a group long - banned in @entity5 amid accusations of terrorism			1
secondly , due to @entity5 sharing borders with both @entity7 and @entity177 , @entity102 is understood to be worried that any move against @entity52 could trigger a wave a car and suicide bombings there - something that would be devastating for the country 's hugely important tourism industry			2
the video emerged as dozens of @entity50 peshmerga fighters left northern @entity177 on their way to @entity5 , from where they will continue their journey to help @entity191 battling @entity52 in @entity8			1
according to spokesman @entity194 , a total of 150 peshmerga fighters left from the city of @entity196 in @entity177 's semi-autonomous @entity50 region			0
he gave no further details			0
last week , the local @entity177 @entity50 government authorised the peshmerga forces to go to neighbouring @entity7 and help fellow @entity191 combat @entity2 militants in @entity8			0
@entity5 , which has riled @entity50 leaders and frustrated @entity204 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity8 said last week it would help @entity177 @entity50 fighters cross into @entity7			2

the fighters themselves left separately , travelling by plane			0
@entity234 , a @entity50 official from @entity8 , said they have no confirmation that peshmerga fighters are to arrive today			0
' we have no information other than what we are reading on social media or hearing on the news			0
' he added that the peshmerga command might have direct contact with the @entity7 @entity50 force known as the @entity246 , or @entity247 , and for that reason @entity50 politicians in @entity7 are not aware of the movement			0
