by @entity0 icon : @entity3 scientist @entity2 has given his name to the @entity5 , but other physicists are pushing to change the particle 's title the discovery of the @entity5 is one of the greatest scientific landmarks of recent years - but would it be so iconic if the particle were called @entity13 , the @entity15 boson or @entity16 ? rival scientists have launched a campaign to rename the so - called ' @entity20 particle ' , claiming that @entity3 physicist @entity2 does not deserve all the credit for the breakthrough discovery			1
and while it may not seem to be a particularly burning issue , its importance is increased by the fact that this year 's @entity27 could be riding on the outcome of the dispute			0
the @entity5 , whose discovery was announced last year , is crucial to scientists ' understanding of physics as it explains why particles have mass. its existence was predicted in a 1964 paper by @entity39 , from @entity40 , and it has been known by his name ever since			1
he has long acknowledged that he is just one of six researchers involved in formulating the theory of the boson , and now one of the other scientists is lobbying for its name to be changed to reflect this , according to the @entity51			2
while most @entity3 institutions have dismissed the campaign as pointless given the popular fame of the @entity5 , it has gained some traction abroad , with a conference in @entity58 trying to ban speakers from referring to the particle by its usual name			1
the most popular alternative name is ' @entity13 ' , in homage to @entity66 scientists @entity64 and @entity67 , who published a paper on the topic shortly before professor @entity2 did so			1
another possibility is to call it the ' @entity16 ' ( pronounced ' berk ' ) , taking account of the contribution by @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , from @entity78			0
discovery : a diagram of the experiment in smashing particles together which helped find the boson claim : @entity76 , who helped to predict the existence of the boson , wants more credit for his work at a conference last month in @entity90 in @entity58 , participants were asked to avoid the term ' @entity5 ' and call the particle the ' @entity15 boson ' instead			1
one of those campaigning to change the particle 's name is professor @entity76 , 76 , who said : ' it should not be called @entity2			2
' the rest of us are fighting not just for our ego but for our place in the annals of physics			0
' professor @entity67 , 80 , has also joined the fight , saying he wanted to pay tribute to his colleague professor @entity64 , who died in 2011			0
' @entity2 is the wrong name for this particle because the paper where the mechanism and structure was first set out was ours , ' he told the @entity51			2
' maybe the name should not matter but it is not pleasant if you have done important work to be ignored			0
' facility : the machinery at the @entity119 in @entity120 where the boson was discovered the row over the name of the boson will take a more serious turn in october , when the particle 's discoverers will be leading candidates to be awarded the @entity129			0
the prize , worth more than $ 1million , can be shared by up to three people , but it is currently unclear who might be eligible to receive the award alongside professor @entity2 , 83			1
many scientists have resisted the push to change the name of the @entity5 , pointing out that the physicist after whom it was named was the first to predict the existence of a previously unknown particle			1
professor @entity77 , 80 , dismissed calls to acknowledge him and his colleagues by renaming the particle , saying : ' the name @entity5 has been in common use for 40 years and it is silly to try to change it			2
' there is no chance that any of the longer names on offer will ever be in everyday use			0
' professor @entity2 himself has not publicly commented on the controversy			1
the hunt for the boson was closely followed by the media and the public after the 17 - mile - wide @entity119 was built in @entity120 at a cost of Â £ 6.2billion in an attempt to find it			0
the announcement of its probable discovery in july last year seemed to confirm the validity of the ' @entity166 ' of particle physics which has been built up over the past decades .			0

@entity5 , discovered last year , is what gives particles their mass
named after professor @entity2 , who predicted its existence in 1964
but other scientists involved in research campaign to be credited for work
