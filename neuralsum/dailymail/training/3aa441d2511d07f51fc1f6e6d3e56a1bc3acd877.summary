business is booming in @entity2 's mountain resorts , and the addition of recreational marijuana stores this year has attracted customers curious about legalized pot. but there 's mounting anxiety that ski towns have embraced stoner culture a little too much , potentially damaging the state 's tourism brand			1
that worry flared up in two resort towns last week			0
in @entity16 , residents voted overwhelmingly to force downtown 's lone dispensary off @entity19 to a less - visible location			1
and just up the road in @entity23 , town officials used a property annex to prevent the first dispensary from opening there			1
the fear is that some families — a mainstay of the ski tourism industry — will stop vacationing here			1
pack up : last week , residents in @entity16 , @entity2 voted to move this dispensary off @entity19 to a less - visible location bad for business ? @entity2 's number two industry is tourism , and those in the business fear that the legalization of pot could have an impact on families vacationing in the state			1

' marijuana , it is not in this country 's dna yet			0
it 's a little bit too early			0
' so far , there 's no indication that legal pot has damaged tourism , @entity2 's number two industry			1
the state notched a record $ 17.3 billion in tourism spending the year after legalization , with a record 64.6 million visitors , and state tourism officials say 2014 is poised to top last year 's record			1
but it 's an open question whether pot has anything to do with it			0
officials cite the improving economy and the weather , with healthy snow totals historically being the most significant driver for mountain visits			0
the state and its marijuana industry are barred by law from advertising weed out of state , and the head of the @entity87 says the state is n't tracking the role of marijuana in tourist behavior			0
' it 's all anecdotal , ' @entity92 said			0
' i have heard from some angry parents who said they 'll never come back to @entity2 because of marijuana			2
and i 've also heard from people who say they came to @entity2 just to see the marijuana			2
safe haven : however , legalization is also driving tourism to the state			2
a report in july found that 90 per cent of recreational marijuana sales in mountain resort communitites were made by out - of - state visitors			0
above , two customers from @entity106 smell strains of marijuana at the @entity110 club last thursday ' too soon ' : moving the @entity56 off @entity19 , was not a ' morality ' issue , @entity16 councilman @entity54 said			1
' marijuana , it is not in this country 's dna yet			0
it 's a little bit too early			0
' above , a pot store employee talks with customers inside the soon - to - move out @entity120 ' at the end of the day , it may be having a modest effect , but it 's not huge either way			2
' the recent friction is n't the first time officials have moved to lower marijuana 's profile			2
the nation 's largest ski operator , @entity129 , made headlines over the last year tearing down makeshift shelters built illicitly in hard - to - reach areas and used by stoners to ' get safe , ' mountain slang for toking up out of the cold and away from ski patrollers			2
resorts across the state are dotted with the so - called smoke shacks , and some of them are decades old			0
' we will continue to communicate that consumption of marijuana is illegal in public and on federal land , ' @entity129 ' @entity141 said in a statement about destroying the shacks in its four areas , @entity150 , @entity16 , @entity151 and @entity152			2
still , at rates greater than their urban neighbors , mountain communities backed marijuana legalization in 2012 , including @entity16 , an early and enthusiastic support base , and there 's no doubt that recreational pot has had an effect on ski towns			1
shhh : @entity2 is not allowed to advertise legalized marijuana outside the state , but out - of - towners are allowed to but it when they travel there			2
above , snowboarders ride a lift at @entity16 , in @entity2 any change ? the state has yet to conduct a report studying the impact of tourism since the legalization of marijuana			1

the influx of shoppers - and camera crews that have become frequent sights as they work on pot - themed news stories and documentaries - has prompted a lively debate among residents about how pot is changing their resorts			0
' whether you 're pro-marijuana or against marijuana , you have to be concerned about how tourists react to seeing it , ' said @entity208 , a @entity16 retiree who voted to move the dispensary			1
others say the marijuana novelty will die down naturally and that resort towns should n't worry about dispensaries or the souvenir shops that put ' @entity216 ' puns on t - shirts			0
' in five or 10 years , it 'll be no big issue , ' said @entity220 , a @entity16 retiree who voted to keep the dispensary on @entity19			1
