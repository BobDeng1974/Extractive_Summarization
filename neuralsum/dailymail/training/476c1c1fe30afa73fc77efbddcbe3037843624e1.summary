he passes to @entity9 who dribbles around several of the @entity26 arch - rival 's stars before setting up a goal for @entity11			1
scroll down to see video ... outrageous : ridiculous claims have said @entity4 star @entity9 ( left ) is helping @entity7 rebels trying to oust president @entity31 ( right ) from power secret code : the way @entity9 and his @entity4 teammates play gave tips to @entity7 rebels , it was claimed his run , it is claimed , can be deciphered as a secret code used by rebels who can then draw a route into @entity7 by tracking the direction of the dribbles , passes and shot			1
the running commentary says : ' here we see the first stage where arms are loaded from @entity23			1
' then they pass through @entity50 and are delivered to another terrorist			2
we also see how they warn that they will face some obstacles until they reach @entity55			2
' then they are transported by bus to the final destination , located in @entity59			0
' start of the move : @entity10 starting of the move is said to signify the arms being unloaded out of @entity23 dribble sign : @entity9 's run , through his @entity16 opponents , signifies how the rebels will face ' some obstacles ' until they reach @entity55 end move : the goal , by @entity11 , is decoded as the arms being transported by bus to the final destination , in @entity59 the staggering allegation is believed by some to be an elaborate hoax , while others see it as government propaganda			1
the ridiculous claims of @entity9 's co-operation with @entity7 rebeal came as he became @entity4 's all - time record scorer			1
the 24 - year - old @entity84 ace ( right ) set the record last night in the 5 - 3 @entity87 match against @entity88 at the @entity89			0
he equalled the mark of 232 official goals set by @entity92 during the 1940s and 50s when he slotted home @entity96 's cross in the 17th minute			1

in his @entity4 career , he has netted an incredible 234 goals in 314 games			0
in just over seven years			0
@entity92 took 13 years to rack up his impressive tally			0
still more think the crazy claims about the @entity121 champions , sponsored by @entity122 , were produced by the rebels in a bid to make dictator @entity31 look @entity126 @entity125 , of @entity127 , told the @entity128 : ' if i were a @entity7 rebel , or someone sympathetic to them , i might make such a video to show the world how silly the @entity31 regime is			1
' the astonishing claims came as fresh violence erupted outside the capital @entity139 , and in two of its suburbs , @entity143 and @entity144 , and in the south , and @entity147 secretary - general @entity146 said the ' extremely dangerous ' conflict could have global repercussions			1
the uprising that began a year ago has transformed into an armed insurgency that is pushing the country closer to a civil war			2
because of @entity7 's close alliances with @entity156 and the @entity23 militant group @entity157 , there are deep concerns that the violence could spread beyond its borders , especially if other nations arm the rebels or send in their own troops			1

' a crisis that has potentially massive repercussions for the region and the world			2
' @entity172 , which includes thousands of army defectors , is the most potent armed group challenging the regime			0

@entity197 , reached by telephone in @entity55 , said the rebels quit fighting and took shelter in homes and apartments , fearing that protracted clashes would destroy the city			0
