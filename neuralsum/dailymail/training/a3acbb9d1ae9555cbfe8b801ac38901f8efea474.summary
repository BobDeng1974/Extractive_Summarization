however of what are regarded as the plum jobs across @entity80 and in wealthy @entity81 capitals the figure rises to somewhere between 70 per cent and 80 per cent			2
she told @entity97 : ' the giving of ambassadorships to people who have raised a lot of money for the campaign has increased and that 's a concern to us in particular			0
] ' there was some thought that with @entity2 being such a " change agent " that he might really do things differently			0
' but it has just been a bigger let down			0
