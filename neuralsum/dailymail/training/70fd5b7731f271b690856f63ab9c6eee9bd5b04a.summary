by @entity0 the headlines trumpeted the alarming news this week ' births to mums over 50 soaring ! ' i had three radio stations call me before 9 am - despite being almost a decade younger , it seems i 'm becoming something of a figurehead for the distasteful trend of the older mum			1
and unless you were living under a rock this week , you will be familiar with new statistics indicating that the number of women over 50 having babies has more than doubled in the past five years			2
@entity0 is sick of hearing people criticise women who become first time mums over 50 it 's still only 154 births in the entire nation in a year so it 's not like it 's common , but still it clearly upsets people			1
indeed , naturally , just below the headline , even before you got the article were ' helpful ' bullet points on all the dangers of this distressing phenomenon			0
it was like they were reporting on an outbreak of some new deadly strain of swine flu			0
' older mums are more at risk of miscarriage ! ' ' babies born to older mums are more at risk of genetic health problems ! ' ' this will cause a @entity43 on the @entity44			1
' and you know what ? that 's really what this is all about			0
i had an email from a friend in @entity53 following one of my many articles in defense of the older mother - and she reiterated something that i know to be true			1
@entity59 , @entity60 , recently gave birth to her daughter , @entity63 , at the age of 50 as an older mum herself , she wrote , ' this just does n't happen this way in @entity70			1
they are really positive about the whole subject here			0
it 's like " if you can do it , good for you ! " they seem to really go after the 40 years and older mom in the @entity78			1
i do n't understand it			0
' i 'm starting to think that i do			0
in the @entity70 , if a woman becomes a mother in her 40s and requires more care , a higher risk of caesarean section , and a few extra scans it 's a cost , at least up until now , handled by her insurance company			1
here , it 's bourne by the @entity78 tax payer			1
and let 's face it , no one wants to pay for your decision to leave it ' too late			0
' to this , i would like to say a few things			0
@entity0 says that @entity70 attitudes towards older mothers are completely different to those in the @entity78 i do n't want to pay for your lung cancer after you chose to smoke , or your diabetes medication after you chose to eat poorly for 20 years			1
i do n't wish to pay for the seven children you conceived but can not financially support , or the cigarettes and alcohol you spend benefit money on			1
i do n't want to support your lifestyle when you claim you are too depressed to find a job , or pay for your subsidised housing when your children harass the neighbours			1
but that 's just me			0
in any case , i do n't get actually get a choice in the matter			2
and even more significantly , what i wish people would understand is that the vast majority of these ' older mums ' are not in this category by choice			1
are they really a brigade of selfish , career - obsessed women too fussy in their choice of partners and too focused on personal freedoms to adequately address their declining fertile years ? you may think so - but i can assure you , they are not			2
the vast majority of women in this group are those who waited until they could financially support a child , as well as making sure they had a supportive and appropriate partner			0
which in today 's world can often feel impossible and is certainly harder than it sounds			0
of course there will be challenges being an older mum - both physically and emotionally			2
anyone who says that 40 or 50 is an ideal time to have a baby should have their head examined			2
biologically ideal is probably around 16 years old - in every other way it 's probably closer to 30 - but the reality is , many of us just do n't get to choose			2
for the women out there who read this latest study and felt judged , let me say this , again : do n't let the haters get you down			0
live your life , find love where you can , and do what you have to do if motherhood is important to you			0
do n't let anyone critique your choices , because simply put , they clearly have n't walked a mile in your middle - aged shoes .			2

@entity0 *shocked* by the lack of support for 50 - plus mums in the @entity78
she says that attitudes are far more positive in @entity70
she says most older mothers do n't have a baby this late through choice
