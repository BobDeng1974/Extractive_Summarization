by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 30 october 2013 cages designed to protect children from @entity4 gray wolves at @entity6 's bus stops have come under fire for demonizing the endangered animals , which have never attacked anyone in the state			1
environmentalists argue the wooden and mesh cages erected in the town of @entity15 a decade ago are only furthering the misunderstanding of the animals , their behaviors and the dangers they pose			1
but supporters of the cages - including residents and conservative anti-government organizations - insist that the animals , which were reintroduced to the area in 1998 , pose a very real threat			1
the debate has resurfaced because the @entity28 proposes to extend @entity30 protections for around 75 wolves left in @entity6 and @entity32			1
necessary ? children stand in a wolf cage in @entity15 , @entity6			1
environmentalists say the cages , designed to protect against the @entity4 gray wolf , give the wrong impression about the animals the @entity28 is also seeking to make it illegal to kill wolves in most situations and would greatly expand the area where wolves can exist without interference , @entity40 reported			1
to many conservatives in the area , the proposals are simply examples of meddling government officials who do not know what it is like to live with wild wolves			2
ranchers are now battling the extension , claiming the animals should be hunted			2
anti-wolf campaigns are underway , portraying the animal as a savage beast that stalks and preys on children			2
the opinion has led to scores of illegal killings of the wolves over the past two decades			2
@entity67 , a teacher in @entity68 where the cages have been built , said even more needs to be done to protect the town 's children			2
danger ? the @entity28 is proposing to extend @entity30 protections for 75 @entity4 gray wolves in @entity6 and @entity32 - but residents say they 're a threat the @entity4 gray wolf , a subspecies of the gray wolf , is the world 's most endangered wolf			1
they typically prey on elk and deer , but are also known to eat rabbits and squirrels			0
after the species was wiped out in the @entity89 , they were bred in captivity and reintroduced to the wild in @entity32 and @entity6 in 1998			1
there are now only around 75 in the states			0
in the past four decades , there have been just three documented wolf attacks on humans in @entity97 - and none of these were by the @entity4 gray wolf			1
the attacks took place in @entity103 and @entity104 , not the @entity105			0
likewise , the incidence of wolves killing cattle and sheep is less common than believed			0
around a third of sheep deaths across the country are due to predators and just 0.4 per cent of those attacks are by wolves , according to the @entity116			2
interestingly , domestic dogs are responsible for almost 20 times more sheep deaths			0
in cattle deaths , wolves kill fewer cows than coyotes , domestic dogs , cougars and vultures			0
nevertheless , residents of @entity6 towns such as @entity15 - where the cages are found - say the animals have stalked and cornered their children , spreading fear in the community			1
she told the @entity134 that seven years ago her son , then 14 , came across three wolves while out walking and backed against a tree as the animals circled him			2
he cocked his gun and the wolves ran off , but ' it was a miracle he was n't killed , ' @entity139 said			0
@entity142 , the executive director of the @entity143 , said that the wolves were bred in captivity and reintroduced into the wild , leaving them unafraid of people			1
' in @entity68 , the wolves were following some kids home from schools , some of them could no longer walk to the bus stop like they used to , ' @entity142 told @entity40			0
' they are a constant problem and we spend a great deal of time and effort on this issue			0
' the approximately 20 cages in @entity15 were installed on the orders of @entity164 , @entity68 sheriff @entity161 said			1
she explained how earlier this year , one of the wolves frightened a mother and her son near a bus stop			0
when she tried to make it leave , it moved towards the mother instead , she said			0
the @entity28 removed the young male wolf by shooting it with an arrow , but the story quickly spread , unsettling residents			1
but @entity176 , director of @entity178 programs for @entity179 , said that keeping the cages was politically motivated , rather than based on safety concerns			0
while there are some - albeit few - reports of animals attacking livestock , they rarely attack humans			1
even with the livestock , domestic dogs kill 20 times as many sheep as wolves do , data shows			2
speaking out : @entity193 , the producer of an anti-wolf film , said the @entity30 was an example of the government meddling in an issue without knowing how it actually affects people ' there 's been absolutely zero , nada , zilch attacks on humans by wolves in the @entity178 , so i think these cages are a reaction to a non-problem , ' @entity199 told @entity208			1
' for some people , it 's a political ploy to bring attention to other things			0
a lot of the fear stirred up by these kid cages , at the base of it , is an anti-government fear and the wolves are standing in for that			1
' yet , still residents in the @entity105 say the decision should be up to them , not @entity223			0
' the wolf is symbolic of a larger fact , ' @entity193 , the producer of an anti-wolf documentary told the @entity134			0
' the federal government is running roughshod over private property rights			0
' we at the local level believe that we understand the needs of our place , rather than somebody in @entity223 '			0

@entity28 has proposed to extend protections for 75 @entity4 gray wolves - *reigniting* a debate about the danger they pose
environmentalists point out there have been no attacks on humans since they were reintroduced into the wild in 1998 and very few on livestock
they argue that ' kid cages ' present the wrong idea about the threat
but residents in @entity15 , @entity6 say the animals have stalked and cornered their children and that the cages are necessary
