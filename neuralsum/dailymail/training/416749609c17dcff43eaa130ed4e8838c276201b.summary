@entity0 find themselves in the farcical situation whereby they have just eight professionals and have had to cancel a pre-season tour to @entity5			1
with just 25 days to go until their championship season gets underway at @entity9 , chairman @entity6 and new manager @entity7 are locked in a stand - off over transfer targets			1
@entity7 has only been in charge of the @entity13 for five weeks - the only signing to date being @entity16 striker @entity15 - but there is no sign of either side backing down and tensions remain high			1
rebuilding job : new boss @entity7 has been force to scrap a summer tour to @entity24 defender @entity25 penned a new deal to make him the sole out - of - contract player to remain			1
teenage centre - back @entity28 - an impressive performer in keeping the club up last season - looks set for a move to @entity32 @entity31 , while there are a host of players on trial , including former @entity38 midfielder @entity37 , at the dilapidated training ground @entity40			1
they were due to fly out to @entity5 on sunday for a nine - day trip but have called it off through a lack of players , shining a light on the shambolic circumstances currently engulfing the @entity49 side			1
it throws up yet more questions as to how @entity52 goes about preparing for the new campaign , given a friendly against @entity54 on saturday and then another when @entity55 visit on august 2 are the only matches planned			2
keeping calm : chairman @entity6 says there 's no need to panic @entity6 , however , is convinced that nothing is wrong at @entity61 - even though the new boss is still yet to give any sort of press conference or media briefing since taking over			1
‘ there is no panic , ’ he told @entity66			0
‘ in fact , i see it as a benefit rather than a downside			0
it allows the manager to bring in his own team , as opposed to a manager picking up a squad that is already overloaded and he does n't think is good enough			0
’ the manager handed @entity6 a sizeable list of up to 50 targets to enquire about last month and has seen minimal return			0
news of the tour cancellation is just another sorry chapter in the recent history of a side who just three years ago were in the @entity87 and only suffered relegation on the final day			2
lonely : @entity25 ( right ) is one of only eight contracted players as well as that , @entity95 - who runs the club ’s loss - making hotel - tweeted about spending the afternoon pigeon shooting alongside brother @entity92 inside the stadium			2
the tweet was later deleted			0
the lack of a squad and - gallingly - a goalkeeper is an obvious cause for concern but there is a further undercurrent of discontent behind the scenes			0
the @entity6 family , who have recently openly mocked fans , have paid themselves and companies they own £ 26million since the club ’s unexpected rise to the top flight , with supporters protesting angrily towards the end of last season in the first show of overt dissent against the ownership in years			0
@entity120 understands that club president @entity121 , whose combined loan of £ 7.2m to the club still has n’t been repaid and helped sign players plus build a stand , is growing ever restless at the club ’s position			2
running out of patience : @entity0 president @entity121 is growing restless			0
