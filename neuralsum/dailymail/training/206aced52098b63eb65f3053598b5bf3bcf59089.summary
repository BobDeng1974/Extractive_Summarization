@entity0 was given a six - year deal when he was picked as sir @entity3 's successor at @entity4 last year - and it seems ' @entity5 ' is still sticking around at @entity6			1
@entity4 have been busy putting up a huge new poster outside their famous home , showing off their new kit design , new players and their new manager			2
@entity12 appears front and centre despite not officially having started his job yet - and eagled - eyed fans have noticed some startling similarities with their unsuccessful former boss			0
in fact , it seems his head has simply been airbrushed on @entity0 ' body ! @entity37 also features on the banner which is being put up as @entity4 prepare for the new season			1
supporters will be hoping that while @entity24 might bear some similarities to @entity0 in this image , he can provide some altogether different results in the @entity44 this coming season			0
crowd of thousand : @entity37 joins the red army fronted by @entity24 - or @entity0 new era : @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 all feature in the new kit advert			0
