by @entity0 a student designer has used a 3d printer to create an intricate prosthetic arm for one of his classmates , taking 45 hours to print it out			1
@entity7 , 23 , made the arm for @entity9 as part of a design competition at @entity12 , @entity13			2
@entity7 decided to make the limb for 21 - year - old @entity9 , despite never having spoken to her before			2
@entity7 ( left ) made an intricate prosthetic arm for @entity9 ( right ) , who was born without a hand , as part of a design competition			1
it took 45 hours to print using a 3d printer @entity7 made this intricate prosthetic limb for @entity9 as part of a design competition			1
it took 45 hours to print using a 3d printer while @entity9 , who was born without a hand , was initially taken back by the offer , curiosity got the better of her and she agreed			1
@entity7 took pictures of her arm from every angle to fit the design around , then used computer software to apply the fine circular details to the outside of the arm			1
he also made part of it hollow , allowing sunlight to pass through or for a light bulb to be placed inside			0
he then printed the arm over 45 hours using a 3d printer which cost $ 200 ( £ 120 )			1
while it has limited practical uses , @entity7 says it was designed more as a piece of jewellery than as an everyday prosthetic			2
the arm has an interlocking pattern running across the surface and a hollow centre allowing light to pass through or a light bulb to be placed inside the arm was designed using computer software and cost £ 200 to make			1
despite not speaking before the project , @entity7 and @entity9 are now firm friends @entity7 said : ' i ’ve always wanted to design a prosthetic arm for as long as i can remember so the contest was the push i needed to finally make one			1
' i wanted it to be designed to take advantage of the possibilities available to the world of prosthetics			0
' this piece was inspired by unique design opportunities only available to a select few			0
' with user defined parameters , each design will be inherently different from the next in style , size and need			0
' @entity9 is one of the first prosthetics to work with the concept of a prosthetics as decoration			0
' @entity9 , from @entity83 , @entity84 , added : ' my initial reaction to the entire conversation was confusion - as @entity7 and i had never spoken to each another			2
the arm was meant to be decorative , but does have limited practical uses such as holding a glass of wine ' i decided to go along with it because i was curious to see what would come out of it and it ’s not every day a complete stranger comes up to you and offers to design you a custom prosthetic			0
' when @entity7 told me the arm had finished printing i was beyond excited to see it			0
' he promised i ’d be the first to see it and when i did i could n’t believe the intricacy and level of detail it had - i was in awe			0
' i immediately tried it on and we were both relieved to find out that it fit me perfectly			0
