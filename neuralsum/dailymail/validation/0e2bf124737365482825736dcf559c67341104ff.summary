@entity1 owner @entity0 has admitted his failure to invest in the squad in january has left them desperately short of cover as they prepare to face @entity7 with just 13 senior players			1

@entity9 revealed that @entity0 regrets not investing in the squad in the january transfer window the @entity1 owner did n't invest in january despite sanctioning the sale of @entity38 and @entity9 says he has been left in a difficult position after @entity1 's hierarchy – @entity0 and managing director @entity41 – decided to allow defenders @entity42 and @entity38 to leave the club in january without bringing in replacements			1
' the fact that @entity41 and @entity0 have acknowledged that ( we are paying the price for not strengthening the squad ) does n't make me feel better , but at least people understand that 's what has happened , ' said @entity9 , whose side have won just one in six since the close of the window as he bids to win the job on a permanent basis			1
' now whether it was me or @entity63 , if he was still here , that would be the same situation			0
@entity65 and @entity66 ( centre right ) are the likely pairing for the upcoming @entity7 match captain @entity19 ( left ) was sent off for a reckless lunge and will miss the next three games ' i have got to deal with that situation and i will			1
what i wo n't do is give up on it , i wo n't think , ' well , i 've got all those people out , that 's it , that 's me done , i 'm not going to get this job '			0
' and @entity9 says the board have already made assurances of significant investment in the summer			2
' the squad needs to be stronger and they have acknowledged that to me - they know they have to invest , ' he said			0
' i have been part of it in the last few weeks and there are things in place			0
that 's from the top			0
