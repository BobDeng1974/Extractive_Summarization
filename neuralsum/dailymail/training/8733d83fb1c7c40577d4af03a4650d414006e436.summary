by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor read my lips : @entity4 told the @entity5 four years ago that ' no matter how we reform health care ... if you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan			1
no one will take it away			0
' between half and three - quarters of @entity1 who buy their own health insurance on the open market will lose those plans in the next year as @entity19 is pushed into full implementation , according to a blockbuster report sure to give the @entity22 a new round of health - care headaches			1
' no matter how we reform health care , ' a newly minted president @entity4 told a meeting of the @entity5 in june 2009 , ' we will keep this promise : if you like your doctor , you will be able to keep your doctor			2
if you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan			0
no one will take it away			0
' but regulations formulated by his own administration make it clear that the @entity22 never intended to to give @entity1 that level of free choice about their medical insurance options			2
@entity44 buzzed friday with reports of what @entity46 had surfaced : an under - the - radar notice in the @entity49 , which @entity50 has dated to june 17 , 2010 , laying out the administration 's expectation that most people who buy their own health insurance will soon have no options other than paying exorbitant rates or joining the federal government 's insurance exchanges			1
@entity22 spokeswoman @entity59 told @entity46 that ' nothing in the @entity19 forces people out of their health plans : the law allows plans that covered people at the time the law was enacted to continue to offer that same coverage to the same enrollees			1
' but millions of individual insurance plans do n't comply with @entity19 's minimum standards , which include services like children 's vision care , dental coverage and reproductive health options that some consumers do n't want			1
millions more with policies written before march 2010 will lose the ' grandfather ' status president @entity4 has promised them because of tiny , marginal changes like premium adjustments or revised prescription copay rates			1
' and so you could decide not to get , in the exchange , the better plan			0
i could keep my @entity110 insurance , just a high - deductible catastrophic plan			0
i would not be required to get the better one			0
' @entity113 , then a @entity115 senator from @entity116 , countered with words that now seem prescient : ' that 's for a very limited period of time			0
' the @entity22 's website continues to communicate the president 's earlier promises			2
' if you like your plan you can keep it , ' one page reads , ' and you do nâ€™t have to change a thing due to the health care law			0
' under the @entity19 and the tens of thousands of pages of related regulations , the grandfathering @entity4 promised only applies to insurance policies that continue , unchanged , from year to year			1
requirements in the @entity134 often force health insurers to rewrite their policies annually in order to re-state consumers ' privacy guarantees , now well - known as ' @entity134 ' rights			2
that simple act of re-issuing a policy that 's identical to the previous one would also render it ineligible for ' grandfather ' status			2
' a reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate and therefore relinquish their grandfather status is 40 to 67 percent , ' the @entity94 wrote on july 17 , 2010			1
the @entity22 's website continues to claim : ' if you like your plan you can keep it and you do n't have to change a thing due to the health care law ' that estimate only covers policies that lose their ' grandfathered ' status by changing , and those which @entity1 voluntarily leave for other reasons			1
but still more will lose coverage , the @entity94 wrote , because their chosen levels of insurance will suddenly fail to meet the @entity22 's definition of an adequate policy			1
16 million : health care analyst @entity165 predicts that 's the number of @entity1 who will lose their preferred medical insurance plans in the coming months the annual total likely ' exceeds the 40 percent to 67percent range , ' according to the @entity94 's statement more than three years ago			1
overall , @entity46 reported monday that of the 14 million @entity1 consumers who buy individual health insurance plans , 50 to 75 per cent will likely receive cancellation notices during the next year			1
and the administration has been expecting that outcome since 2010			0
that conclusion came as a result of estimates from four sources deeply involved with the administration 's work on the @entity19 , one of whom said as many as 80 per cent of individual insurance customers will be short on choices by this time in 2014			1
months of wrangling over the @entity19 law in 2009 included jousting over whether a range of services including mental health and drug abuse treatments , dental provisions and and vision care for children should be mandated for every qualifying insurance policy , even though not all consumers want them			2
@entity198 generally won those battles , resulting in a minimum set of health insurance standards that has placed most individual policies out - of - bounds			1
in their places are new , more robust plans expected to bring ' sticker shock ' to millions			0
health policy analyst @entity165 , who consults with @entity1 's largest insurers , estimated this month that ' as many as 16 million ' such policies will be canceled because they do n't comply with the @entity19 law			1
that represents 80 per cent of his estimate that 19 million such plans , provided by neither governments nor employers , are in existence today			0
@entity219 's @entity218 exploded : @entity4 ' said " if you like your plan you can keep it , period			0
" if he wanted to be honest , he should not have said " period			0
" he should have said " asterisk			0
" news networks buzzed late on friday as they discovered what @entity46 had found : evidence that the @entity4 administration has known for three years that the president 's promise simply could n't be kept			1
this example , from july 19 , 2010 , hit the @entity230 five weeks after the @entity94 published it in the @entity49 ( above ) the @entity22 has begun to concede that many @entity1 who buy their health insurance directly from companies on the open market will lose their current coverage , but counters that most of them will find better coverage on the exchanges , and at a lower net cost when subsidies for lower - income taxpayers are factored in			1
cornered by a reporter on monday , @entity22 press secretary @entity240 admitted that ' there are going to be changes brought about by the @entity19 to create minimum standards of coverage , minimum services that every insurance plan has to provide			1
' ' so it 's true , ' he said , ' that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual market that do n't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the @entity19			1
' the @entity254 has chronicled recent news reports documenting 1.49 million policy cancellation notices that insurers have already sent customers in @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity267 reports in @entity268 , @entity269 , and @entity270 , the organization said , came without precise numbers			2
in @entity260 , the @entity272 reports that the recipients of those letters are surprised to learn how much they would have to pay to stay insured without entering a government - run program			0
' this is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people , ' @entity277 , director of the @entity278 , told the @entity272			0
' there are winners and losers under the @entity19			0
' how long are @entity1 ' memories ? @entity4 's 2009 @entity5 speech , and the dozens that preceded and followed it , laid down a marker on consumer choice that he wo n't find it easy to escape @entity294 secretary @entity293 ( @entity295 ) will face congressional questions wednesday about the @entity19 rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers			1
@entity301 administrator @entity300 ( r ) will have her turn tuesday			0
on tuesday a key @entity19 administrator will testify in a @entity305 hearing about the unrelated technical failures that have plagued @entity307 , the @entity19 system 's main website			2
@entity300 , the administrator of the @entity301 , will face tough questions about why the website was launched without adequate testing , and why her agency was tapped to coordinate the work of dozens of software contractors instead of a more experienced outside company			2
@entity294 secretary @entity293 will have her turn on the hot seat wednesday , when she faces a hostile panel in a @entity323 hearing			0
@entity293 's grilling will likely include broader questions about the @entity19 program			2
she was asked to appear in @entity327 last week but declined .			0

president @entity4 has promised for 4 years that individual health insurance policies will be ' grandfathered ' in so they wo n't change under @entity19
but the @entity94 wrote in june 2010 that 40 to 67 per cent ' of those policies will ' relinquish their grandfather status ' anyway
@entity46 found sources close to the @entity19 planning table who put that number as high as 80 per cent
millions of @entity1 are already receiving cancellation notices from their insurers
the @entity22 conceded monday that ' it 's true ' many plans do n't meet @entity19 's minimum standards , so @entity1 wo n't get to keep them
the *revelations* come as the @entity4 administration is already under fire for the @entity19 website 's horrendous launch on october 1
two key *appointees* from the @entity294 will face tough questions this week on @entity354
