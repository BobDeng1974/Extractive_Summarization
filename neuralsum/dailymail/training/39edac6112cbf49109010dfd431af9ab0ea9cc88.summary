@entity0 started and finished the move for @entity3 's second - click here for more stats in our ultimate match zone package so , no points at stake , and the @entity10 may count for a big fat zero in the grand scheme , but try telling those at @entity3 who detected the wind of change amid the chaos of @entity17			1
after ending nine empty years with the @entity18 in may , here was their first @entity10 win since the @entity22 era and the man responsible for transporting the trophy across @entity25 seemed at odds with its heavy wooden travelling box as he left the premises			0
those who packed the red - and - white end of @entity32 on sunday truly enjoyed this victory , gathering more silver and a slice of revenge over @entity37 — a team who keep poaching their players and smashed six past them at the @entity42 last year			1
when @entity44 lashed a spectacular third into the top corner from 25 yards , the @entity3 supporters launched an impromptu ‘ @entity49 ’ celebration designed to taunt the @entity37 fans			1
goals : @entity57 21 , @entity0 42 , @entity44 60 @entity37 : @entity81 5 , @entity82 6 , @entity83 5 , @entity84 5 , @entity85 5.5 ( @entity86 76 ) ; @entity87 5 ( @entity88 85 ) , @entity89 6 ( @entity90 60 , 6 ) , @entity91 6 , @entity92 5 ( @entity93 46 , 6 ) , @entity94 5 ( @entity95 60 , 5.5 ) , @entity96 5.5			1
subs : @entity98 , @entity99			1
booked : @entity91 att : 71,523 man of the match : @entity0 referee : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) ratings by @entity106 at @entity32 soon they were singing @entity109 ’s name			1
to think , when his team trailed to @entity112 in the @entity18 semi-final , shortly after losing 3 - 0 at @entity114 and surrendering the initiative in the race for the top four , it seemed the @entity117 was nearing the end of his @entity3 odyssey			0
four months on and his team are heading into this campaign more optimistic than for many years , fuelled by this emphatic scoreline , performance , a clean sheet and goals from @entity44 , @entity57 ( below ) and @entity0			1
it is ever thus in this annual fixture			0
if it goes badly , as it did for city manager @entity128 , then shrug and pretend it was never more than a glorified preparation game			1
if it goes well , then seize the moment and squeeze out all the positive energy you can			0
he was quick to emphasise the game ’s value and bask in his wealth of attacking options			0
it is remarkable how an @entity18 win can transform the atmosphere at a club			0
not the magic of the cup in a traditional sense , but it has cast a spell and the infighting which has plagued @entity3 in recent years has abated			0
even @entity149 , the clubs second largest shareholder , has emerged with an olive branch for owner @entity153			0
@entity154 hails ' complete ' @entity3 performance mockery : @entity3 fans poked fun at the @entity37 supporters by doing the ' @entity49 ' celebration after the third goal crisp finish : @entity57 drove into the bottom right - hand corner with his left foot to open the scoring skipping in : goalkeeper @entity166 could do nothing about the effort as it bobbled beyond him happy man : @entity57 wheeled away in celebration after finding the net in the 21st minute more than that , @entity109 ’s team shows signs that it might be developing nicely into a unit with balance and solidity , as well as its customary flair			1
the squad remains thin in some areas — like central defence and centre forward — but there were just enough flashes of @entity75 to leave the crowd wanting more and teenager @entity186 has the makings of a composed central defender			1
@entity72 performed well and @entity189 proved again that his raw talent is not easy to defend against			2
@entity37 ’s young centre halves certainly made it look that way and @entity77 was central to the first two goals			1
first , he brought down the ball and nudged it to @entity72			2
the @entity198 man was then flattened by @entity83 as he allowed the pass to roll on to @entity57 who , in turn , drove it past @entity166			2
all smiles : @entity186 goes over to congratulate the playmaker after he found the net linking up so soon : @entity57 gets a hug from @entity75 after opening the scoring in the capital @entity77 had continued to run into an offside position , arguably across the goalkeeper ’s line of sight , but there was no great dispute and @entity3 were ahead , deservedly so			1
@entity77 then dragged an effort wide , having been released by @entity57 , and forced a save with a header from a corner , before assisting @entity0 for the second			1
after 16 goals last season , culminating in the winner in the @entity18 final , @entity0 is off and running again			2
he took the ball from @entity224 , twisted and slammed it low past @entity81 , who had been preferred to @entity198 no 1 @entity98			2
this may have been a good game for @entity98 to miss. @entity81 was badly exposed by a patchwork back four and @entity98 could be back for sunday ’s trip to @entity230			2
@entity37 , however , does not seem like a happy place for @entity198 players			2
off to a flyer : @entity0 was already on his way to celebrate as the ball hit the back of the net all too easy : @entity3 were roared forward by @entity0 from midfield and raced into a 2 - 0 half - time lead getting a soaking : the triumphant @entity3 players sprayed each other with champagne afterwards the manager started with a grand total of none			2
clearly he has reservations about @entity98 and preferred to play @entity82 out of position at right - back rather than to start with @entity250			2
it is a side issue			0
@entity128 ’s greatest worry will be the way his team defended all over the pitch , even if they were without so many stars because he refused to consider those who had played beyond the group stages of the @entity258			0
@entity3 were missing their own @entity260 trio of @entity258 winners but looked slicker and more competitive , ready for the challenges ahead , which include a @entity264 play - off tie with @entity265			0
the season looks to be upon @entity37 a little too soon , though @entity128 is safe in the knowledge he judged last season ’s run perfectly			1
shut your eyes : @entity273 , @entity72 , @entity57 , @entity75 and @entity70 smile after getting wet picture perfect : @entity57 borrows a camera and takes a selfie with full back @entity277 on the pitch the champions improved in the second half			1
@entity93 added intelligence to their football which provided a lift and @entity286 hit a post with a header , having beaten @entity65 in the air			0
@entity64 then denied him with a smart save , low to his right			0
@entity44 put the outcome beyond doubt on the hour , with an eye - catching strike which beat @entity81 , having clipped @entity84 to acquire the added loop required to find the top corner			0
cue the @entity49 and dancing in the aisles			0
‘ our doctor thinks it could be broken — and that will be four to six weeks minimum			0
‘ but i ’m pleased for @entity303 , who has come in from @entity304 a few weeks ago , as he wants to play football and he will get that opportunity here now			0
’ here to stay : @entity44 points to the @entity3 badge after thundering home the third from difference over him in a flash ! @entity166 could do nothing about @entity44 's stinging effort from distance have that : @entity44 took one touch before unleashing an unstoppable shot on @entity81 's goal hugging the little man : @entity57 is embraced by @entity44 after the @entity117 's 60th minute goal having a gaze : @entity81 flung himself at the strike but ended up being nowhere near it leaving a foot in : a determined - looking @entity75 takes the ball beyond @entity84 sliding in : @entity0 brings down @entity82 in the opening stages at @entity32 under his spell : @entity75 displayed superb close touch control throughout his first game in an @entity3 shirt give it back ! @entity57 pleads for the ball from his manager @entity109 after it rolled out of play having a nibble : @entity87 tries to nick possession off @entity72 in midfield watching brief : the respective managers - @entity109 ( left ) and @entity128 - stand on the touchline it 's magic : @entity103 marks out a 10 - yard wall with the vanishing spray made famous at the @entity258 try getting this back ! @entity89 holds off the challenge of @entity72 with consummate ease battle : @entity76 tries to win the ball off @entity37 substitute @entity90 shrugging off : @entity87 and @entity69 vie for possession in the second half best wishes : the @entity18 chairman @entity354 shakes the hand of @entity89 during the pre-match pleasantries remaining square : @entity57 puts pressure on @entity82 as the @entity37 defender lays off to a team mate up and under : @entity0 clears his lines despite the attention of @entity82 close by tracking back : @entity189 hunts down @entity37 full back @entity85 little bit damp ! @entity37 supporters remained in high spirits despite the torrential rain in @entity25 strong : @entity0 clatters into @entity286 in order to win the ball for the @entity370 now you see , now you do n't ! sanogo powers beyond central defender @entity84 down the line : @entity65 is thwarted by @entity85 as the debutant tried to deliver a cross meeting of minds : @entity77 has his shirt pulled by defender @entity83 they 're here , they 're there : @entity32 had plenty of empty seats in its top tier despite favourable pricing over he goes : @entity286 is felled by @entity70 as he breaks free of the sitting midfielder video it 's an honour to captain @entity3 - @entity70 tussle : @entity84 and @entity91 make sure there 's no way @entity77 is holding the ball up around the back : @entity94 gets beyond @entity66 but ca n't find a way past @entity64			1

@entity75 made his competitive debut for the @entity370
@entity0 and @entity57 scored before @entity44 's *stunner*
@entity128 's @entity400 champions had no answer at @entity32
@entity98 was left on the bench for @entity37 and @entity72 impressed
