it 's the stuff of nightmares			0
a man frantically bounds from roof - to - roof , running from a pack of blood - thirsty zombies			1
thankfully , this is not the apocalypse , but a white - knuckle point - of - view video , featuring a @entity12 athlete dramatically scaling walls and leaping between buildings			1
inspired by the highly - anticipated action survival game , @entity16 , the video is shot from the point - of - view of a @entity12 athlete , charting his frantic escape from zombies , over the rooftops of @entity22			1
its director , @entity23 , 23 , told @entity25 : ' i wanted to have something that took the viewer on a whirlwind parkour experience , but finish in a way that felt true to the tone of the game			0
the video is shot from the point - of - view of a parkour runner , charting his frantic escape from zombies no injuries occured while filming the @entity37 - but there was an incident when one cast member was eating while walking down the stairs ' i ’ve been involved in @entity12 since 2005 , and pursuing it professionally since 2010			1
i usually work as a director for films involving parkour , but also as photographer and consultant from time to time			0
' the dramatic video was shot over three days in the director 's home town			2
@entity23 explained : ' collectively , i felt we all knew @entity22 best for this film			1
its the closest looking city to the game i could think of , and i had a lot of confidence in scouting out locations that i knew we could work with			0
' ' we had to battle the weather and light a bit , as we shot last november			0
we had quite a lot of rain during the shoot , and you can see plenty of puddles in the film because of this			2
' well - known @entity12 athlete @entity71 stars as the hero , who is chased through the streets of @entity22 frantic chase : the video 's director , @entity23 , has been involved in @entity12 since 2005 hands off : in a dramatic moment , one of the video 's blood - thirsty zombies grabs the hero 's crotch ' we had @entity71 as the hero zombie , and @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 rounded out my zombie cast			1
they ’re all very talented and well known @entity12 athletes , so i had a bit of an all - star crew really			1
' ' i think my favourite moment is around 2:15 , where the zombie jumps at the hero and grabs at his … crotch			2
it was planned the zombie would grab at the hero , but it just happened to be that he grabbed there			0
' i actually liked the authenticity of the take and knew it would be something that viewers would want to comment on , so i left it in			0
' we had one small injury where one of the guys was eating while walking down stairs during a location move , but nothing from parkour ! these guys are so highly trained in their movement , its always the little things that get them			0
