' after the @entity55 , the floating @entity57 rings and @entity58 jetting into the @entity57 opening ceremony , the @entity4 really has seen it all this year			0
cheering up commuters : the oversized duck was a sight to behold in the chilly december dawn ' the giant duck was a perfect way to round it all off and it certainly cheered everyone up			0
' no one could suppress a smile as they saw it sailing past on its way to @entity30			0
' miss @entity35 , who is patron of the @entity40 , said she hoped the duck stunt would encourage people to come up with their own ideas			1

' past the @entity27 : the duck practically dwarfed the former @entity112 on its early morning journey not quite the @entity114 : the giant rubber duck weighing half a ton sailed down the @entity4 this morning look out for the ravens : the duck attracted a crowd as it was towed past the @entity120 not quite what the schoolchildren had come to see : the duck sailed past @entity30 today traffic stopping : @entity20 usually opens for more traditional craft such as tall - masted ships			1

half - ton bath toy swam through @entity25 this morning to ' cheer people up '
