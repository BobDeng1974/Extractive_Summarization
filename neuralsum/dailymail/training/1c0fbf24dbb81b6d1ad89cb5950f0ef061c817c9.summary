defeat : @entity0 , pictured , has to remove eight static caravans for ' sleepovers ' a naturist club which is popular with swingers has been ordered to remove caravans used for ' sleepovers ' by nudist guests after neighbours complained that those staying in them were making too much noise			1
@entity0 , in the sleepy @entity11 village of @entity12 , currently has eight static caravans which it hires out for £ 50 a night to nudists visiting from around the @entity14 and @entity15			1
but now the local council has ruled that the structures were put up without planning permission and must be removed			1
the club , which holds weekly parties attended with local swingers , is situated on 23 acres of land in the grounds of @entity24			1
as well as the party nights , @entity0 - founded in 1967 - offers visitors naked wrestling , swimming in a heated pool , body painting , badminton , football and nude rambling in the forest			2
the club also has two eight - person jacuzzis , a sauna and a steam room , while its party room contains a dance floor and space for 180 people at its ' exciting and hedonistic ' parties			2
guests are told they can strip naked as soon as they reach the car park , as the club is officially ' clothing - optional '			0
but @entity47 , the chair of @entity48 , said that the club 's caravans were a major ' noise nuisance ' problem for neighbours			1
' because the parties go on to the early hours , there 's considerable potential for people living nearby to have problems , ' he said			0
' there have been complaints of excess noise and passers - by being exposed to naked people			0
' visit : guests are told they can remove their clothes as soon as they reach the car park of the club the parish council complained that the accommodation was ' out of character ' for the area , and last week @entity72 ruled that they should be removed			0
chief planning officer @entity73 said the caravans constituted an ' inappropriate development in the @entity76 ' , adding that they ' detracted from the rural setting and natural character of the ancient woodland '			0
local @entity80 said : ' the nudist club has been here for years and there are n't too many problems really , although it 's a bit of a shock when you meet a bunch of naked people wandering around the woods			0
' i think it 's a case of each to their own , but some people in the village get quite annoyed about the noise and when people stay over obviously the noise goes on a bit longer			0
i dare say the caravans are rocking all night , but i 've never been invited ! ' picturesque : the club is set in 23 acres of woodland near the sleepy village of @entity12 in @entity11 the club 's boss @entity105 admitted the caravans did not have planning permission , but said they had been in place for more than 20 years without any problems			1
he added : ' we just want to keep the static caravans for our members to stay in rather than having to drive home			2
' it 's a niche market so we get people coming from all over the place - from @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , even @entity122 and @entity123			0
' a spokesman for the club said it would appeal against the decision , adding : ' the club has a number of members who travel long distances to attend meetings and events held by the club , and small - scale provision of overnight accommodation allows members to relax and enjoy an alcoholic drink without any concerns of irresponsible late - night travelling			1
