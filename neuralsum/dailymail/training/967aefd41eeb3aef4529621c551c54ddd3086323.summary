@entity0 bedtime stories , engaging in conversation and eating evening meals as a family are seen as hallmarks of conscientious parenting			1
but according to new research , while they may be positive ways of bonding with children , none of them have any influence on their intelligence			1
a criminology professor has found evidence to support the argument that @entity19 is in fact largely down to genetics			1
this study follows a sample of teenagers who were in grades 7 to 12 in the @entity43 in 1994 , tracking them into adulthood			2
the last interview was in 2008 when the sample was aged 24 to 32			0
using the information he collated , professor @entity32 analysed parenting behaviours and whether they had an effect on verbal intelligence as measured by the @entity53 ( @entity54 )			1
during the test an examiner presents a series of pictures to a person			0
there are four pictures to a page , and each is numbered			0
the examiner says a word describing one of the pictures and then asks the individual to point to or say the number of the picture that the word describes			0
the iq tests were given to the children when they were in middle school , high school and aged 18 and 26			2
after studying the habits of adoptive parents , professor @entity32 found that there was no association between parenting and a child 's intelligence later in life			2
his study strengthens the theory that intelligence ( illustrated in a stock image ) is passed down genetically from parents to children last month , scientists revealed that differences in gcse scores are largely down to @entity93			1
a study of more than 6,500 pairs of twins showed that variations in grades in english , maths and science papers could largely be explained by the mix of genes passed from parents to child			2
some 62 per cent of the difference in scores across the group was down to @entity93			0
the other 38 per cent can be explained by ‘ environmental ’ factors			0
this term covers a large range of things from upbringing to health and diet			0
but while genes – or nature – are more important than nurture , it is not all about intelligence			2
many other factors , including personality and behaviour , are also influenced by our genes – and affect exam scores			0
even what we think of our teachers , can to some degree be traced back to our genes , the study by @entity126 says			2
‘ previous research that has detected parenting - related behaviours affect intelligence is perhaps incorrect because it has n't taken into account genetic transmission , ’ professor @entity32 explained			1
some studies have shown that parents who socialise their children by reading to them , for example , have smarter children than parents who do not engage in this way			1
but others argue that intelligence is passed down from parent to children genetically , not socially			1
to investigate which theory is true , professor @entity32 looked at families raising adopted children			1
‘ when we tested these two competing hypotheses in this adoptive - based research design , we found there was no association between parenting and the child 's intelligence later in life once we accounted for genetic influences , ’ professor @entity32 said			1
the finding is published in the journal @entity163			0
studying children who share no dna with their adoptive parents eliminates the possibility that parental socialisation is really just a marker for genetic transmission , he explained			0
‘ in previous research , it looks as though parenting is having an effect on child intelligence , but in reality the parents who are more intelligent are doing these things and it is masking the genetic transformation of intelligence to their children			1
’ however , professor @entity32 stressed neglect or trauma may affect a child ’s prospects			0
‘ the way you parent a child is not going to have a detectable effect on their iq as long as that parenting is within normal bounds , ’ he concluded .			0

reading bedtime stories and having family dinners may socialise children
but activities do n't have an effect on their intelligence , a new study claims
@entity33 research studied adopted children to work out if their intelligence was down to nurturing or genetics
