it did n’t take long for @entity2 head coach @entity1 to address his team ’s biggest question mark heading into sunday ’s showdown at @entity6 against the @entity7			1
will @entity8 play ? @entity1 did n’t answer that question specifically , but as a @entity11 might suggest : the signs point to yes			1
‘ we anticipate @entity8 being able to practice today			2
hopefully he ’ll be able to have a full practice , ’ @entity1 said on thursday at @entity12			2
@entity2 quarterback @entity8 winds up a pass during training at @entity12 in @entity17 @entity8 ( left ) has a chat with fellow @entity2 quarterback @entity19 during the session in north @entity17 ‘ we ’ll see			1
hopefully he ’s able to do what we want him to do during a thursday practice and as the week goes on he ’ll feel good with the work he ’s gotten and be able to play in the ball game			2
’ the 34 - year - old missed last week ’s game against the @entity26 because of a back injury he sustained in week 8 against the @entity28			1
backup @entity19 was abysmal filling in against the @entity26 in week 9 with two interceptions and only 18 completions for 183 yards			1
@entity1 and the rest of the @entity2 are eager to see how @entity8 ’s back holds up on thursday			1
@entity2 head coach @entity1 is hoping @entity8 will fit for sunday 's game at @entity6 ‘ you want to have constant communication with all of your players , especially players who are dealing with injuries , ’ said the 48 - year - old coach			1
‘ not to the point where it ’s distracting , but you want honest feedback from guys who are coming back from injury so you can handle them the right way			2
’ ‘ we would never put a player in harm ’s way			0
obviously it ’s a very physical sport we play and these guys are always putting themselves on the line , but the medical staff will clear the player regardless of who the player is			0
' we ’ll make the right decision as a coaching staff on if that player is ready to play			0
he has to be functional and able to protect himself			0
we ’d never put anybody in a bad situation			0
’ the @entity2 have spent the week training at the home of @entity66 rugby club the @entity2 have lost two straight games and could badly use @entity8 back calling plays to help them secure a win heading into their bye week			1
however before @entity8 is put to the test at @entity6 , @entity1 said he must first get passing marks at @entity12			2
‘ every day is a test , every day we come out here it ’s a competition , it ’s a test , ’ @entity1 , a former quarterback himself , said			1
the @entity2 squad go through their paces ahead of their clash with @entity7 at @entity6 ‘ we ’re finding out who ’s ready , who ’s getting themselves prepared			2
and certainly that applies to everybody on our team ; that applies to the guys who are coming back from injury			0
we want to see @entity91 practice , if he ’s not able to practice , we ’ll put @entity19 in			0
but hopefully he ’ll get himself warmed up , ready to go and have a good day today for our team			0
’ whether @entity8 is able to play on sunday or not , @entity95 ’s game plan will remain relatively unchanged , although @entity1 acknowledged that things would open up with his no. 1 quarterback back in the lineup			1
‘ whoever is playing , they ’re gon na have a responsibility to play the way we want to play , ’ @entity1 said			1
@entity8 ( centre ) has not featured for the @entity2 since injuring his back in week eight against the @entity28 ‘ we ’ll tailor things to certain guys , but for the most part the game plan will be full regardless of who the quarterback is			1
there ’s a responsibility for everyone to do their job and play well			0
when you do that , regardless of who ’s playing next to you , that gives you the best chance to have success			0
’ no matter if it ’s @entity8 or @entity19 under centre , the @entity95 offensive line will have their collective hands full making sure @entity7 ’s pass rush , which has already collected 27 sacks this season , is stymied			1
‘ @entity129 of what the quarterback ’s health is , the @entity7 pass rush is really good			0
they have guys that can rush and there ’s a mentality to rush the passer			0
they ’re very good as individual rushers , ’ @entity1 , who has a 35 - 30 record with the @entity2 , said			1
‘ they do a good job getting up the field and affecting the passing game			0
regardless of what the health status is of your quarterback , you have to make sure you protect against these guys			0
it ’s the offensive line ’s job to make sure the quarterback is n’t affected and to keep the pocket clean			0
’ if all goes to plan , the line will be keeping the pocket clean for @entity8 , not @entity19 .			2

@entity2 quarterback @entity8 has n’t trained since injuring his back in week eight of the @entity*15*4 series
@entity8 has thrown for *15* *touchdowns* and almost *2,000* yards this season
back - up @entity19 failed to impress during the @entity2 ' 28 - 17 week 9 loss to @entity26
head coach @entity1 says @entity8 has to be ‘ able to defend himself ’ to play on sunday
