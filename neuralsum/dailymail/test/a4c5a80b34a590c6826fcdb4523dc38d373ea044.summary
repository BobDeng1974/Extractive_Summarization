@entity0 is made for @entity1			1
though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with @entity6 ’s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of @entity9 values , he is , in reality , more @entity11 than the @entity11			2
for that night in @entity14 - almost the last time an @entity1 team truly thrilled a global audience at the @entity17 , even if they did so in defeat – is remembered by @entity0 for more than his notorious role in @entity6 ’s sending off , which left @entity1 down to ten men for most of the match			1
' that game was the best international match i 've played in , ' said @entity0 , remembering the @entity17 knock out match , which @entity25 won on penalties after a 2 - 2 draw			1
given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment			0
@entity0 is hoping to lead @entity31 to second successive @entity33 final @entity1 's @entity6 kicks out at former midfielder midfielder @entity0 during the @entity35 ' i love playing against the @entity11 , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ they 're so passionate , so aggressive , so committed			0
they were incredible that night			0
@entity39 and @entity40 were extraordinary			0
at times it seemed @entity39 was fighting us on his own			0
you have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men			0
’ and as @entity0 stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the @entity33 final last year , in full confrontational mode , seeking out @entity51 , who had kicked the ball at the @entity31 bench in celebration of @entity56 ’s 4 - 1 win , it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head			1
there is much more to @entity0 than that of course			2
he had come within two minutes of winning that @entity33 final on a wage bill which was famously less than @entity64 ’s			1
since that defeat , he has exacted his revenge at every turn			0
@entity56 were beaten in the @entity68 over two legs , then knocked out of the @entity70 , also over two legs , by @entity31 , beaten at the @entity72 and then , most spectacularly , beaten 4 - 0 at the @entity73 last february			1
@entity6 looks towards the referee during the @entity17 clash between @entity1 and @entity25 the former @entity1 man was shown a red card for lashing out at @entity0 during the knock - out match last week the teams drew 0 - 0 in the first leg of their @entity33 quarter - final ; on wednesday they resume hostilities at the @entity83			1
@entity56 may be marginal favourites but under @entity0 , @entity31 have gone from the side that could never beat @entity56 – they had n’t won for 14 years against them – to the side that ( almost ) never loses to them			1
what is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in @entity93			0
of course , he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma			0
in his native @entity25 they always assumed he would be a manager , such was his dominance of the national team as a captain			1
but his early results were very mixed			0
he looked innovative and the man to watch at @entity102 , where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players			0
it worked : they chased down @entity108 for the league title even if he was , in those days , criticised for being overly focused on attacking players			2
at @entity112 though , it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far			0
he finished bottom of the league and had to resign			0
the @entity119 boss confronts @entity51 during @entity56 's 4 - 1 @entity33 final win last year @entity0 speaks to referee @entity121 during the showpiece final at the @entity123 he revived his reputation somewhat at @entity125 and @entity126 but when he was given the @entity31 job in 2011 , it seemed more like the old boys ’ network at work – he was an iconic player there in the 1990s – than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in @entity93 of course , the success has been unrelenting , with a trophy every year : the @entity138 in 2012 ; the @entity70 in 2013 , beating @entity139 ’s @entity56 in the final ; and the extraordinary feat of wining @entity142 ahead of @entity143 and real last season			1
this year he is comfortably - placed for another @entity33 spot but the title is out of the question			1
@entity148 though is right to be nervous ahead of wednesday ’s quarter final			2
if there were a team for the big occasion , it is @entity31			2
the 44 - year - old got the better of @entity155 boss @entity139 during his side 's 3 - 1 victory at @entity158 he makes a habit of out - witting @entity93 ’s best minds			1
it is n’t just @entity148 who has been his victim			0
@entity139 , too , back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season , when @entity31 stunned @entity155 at @entity158			1
having brought the game back to 1 - 1 and being ahead on away goals , you might have expected @entity168 ’s side to sit back			2
but they came out for the second half pressing even harder , pushing forwards whenever they could			0
in effect , @entity172 did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3 - 1 win			0
and yet there is something very @entity11 about @entity0 ’s style			1
it ’s not just the frequent use of 4 - 4 - 2 , the wide men , the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it ’s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped : ‘ made in @entity1			1
’ it ’s why @entity0 so related to @entity39 and @entity40 and their performance in that extraordinary 2 - 2 draw in @entity14			1
@entity40 , @entity39 , @entity0 ; they ’re all cast from the same mould			2
the @entity195 manager is understandably adored by the @entity31 faithful despite his team 's combative style the @entity31 players circle around @entity0 as they prepare for the @entity33 clash against @entity56 he ’s not about to move , having just signed a new contract with @entity31 until 2020 and we may never see him in the @entity203			1
the problem for @entity172 is that his @entity11 values are no longer fashionable in @entity1			2
when @entity207 choose a new manager , it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club , from academy to the first team , under the direction of @entity216			1
when @entity218 appoint , pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach			0
@entity222 , now establishment , might baulk at a street fighter as manager , though they had one once before and he did n’t do so badly			0
he would be adored at @entity226 , but it would be another gear change from the @entity230 style that the club has embraced			0
@entity155 , too , though falling back on @entity139 , also have had the @entity143 model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with @entity0			2
maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years			0
but @entity0 is useful antidote to those who think @entity11 football ’s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game			2
perhaps he ’s just become too @entity11 for the new @entity1 @entity31 and @entity56 drew 0 - 0 in the first leg of their @entity33 quarter - final @entity0 is tossed in the air by his players as they celebrate their @entity246 league title last season			1

@entity0 has worked wonders with @entity142 side @entity31
@entity0 is often remembered for his notorious role in the sending off of @entity252 during @entity1 's clash against @entity25 in 1998
he led @entity31 to the @entity142 title and @entity33 final last year
@entity195 boss would be perfect for the @entity203 , but clubs are wary of his style of management
when @entity207 choose a new manager , it will be someone who can help to bring tiki - taka football
