a council has said it will cancel a village hall ’s rate subsidy if it hosts a speech by @entity5 leader @entity4			1
mr @entity4 is due to give a talk at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , today			2
but @entity10 has told those who run the hall they will have to repay the £ 376 they received as a charity in rate relief if the speech goes ahead			1
controversial : @entity4 's planned speech in @entity8 is at the centre of a storm between a village hall and its local council however the council has been accused of trying to ' blackmail ' the village hall			1
@entity10 leader @entity25 said the local authority was ' committed to equality of opportunity and to community harmony			1
he added : ' we have no intention of providing financial subsidy to those who aim to undermine these principles			2
' @entity5 party spokesman @entity35 said : ' it 's quite beyond belief what they are trying to do			0
payback : the people who run @entity42 ( pictured ) have been told if they do not withdraw the event they will have to repay a rate subsidy ' they 're basically seeking to tax people who do n't agree with the @entity46 , which is not really the @entity48 way to do things			1
' it 's effectively blackmail , putting a gun to the people that run the hall by giving them a financial penalty if @entity4 is allowed to speak there			2
he 's an mep , he 's not some person off the street			0
' ' beyond belief ' : @entity35 accused the council of trying to blackmail the village hall councillor @entity25 said he had been approached by members of the community who were unhappy at mr @entity4 's appearance			1
he went on : ' we have discretion about providing an element of business rate relief to charities			0
' here we have a charity that is providing a platform within its community building to the national leader of a political party committed to challenging these principles			0
' if the charity wants to run a community facility for genuine community groups like @entity81 , @entity82 etc then it can withdraw the booking from the @entity5 and the council will reconsider the business rates			0
' earlier this month @entity86 was forced into a u-turn on plans to have mr @entity4 join a debate on immigration			0
the university said it could not guarantee the safety and wellbeing of staff and students and warned the party leader he would not be allowed on its campus .			0
