while at the university , he became heavily involved on campus , and proved a prolific fundraiser for the @entity113 athletics programme , of which he was president			0
but @entity7 , dubbed a ' straight shooter ' by his peers , turned his back on rallies against the @entity119 war and the church 's conservative rules , staying away from a protest on the ban on black priests			1
aside from his friends and admirers , there was a handful of students who did not think much of the straight - a english literature student from good @entity10 pedigree			0

to me , it was n't that funny			0

conservative : the @entity176 attended the @entity10 - run @entity21 in @entity52 , @entity39 while a student at @entity21 , @entity7 garnered good relationships with teachers and would greet them in the halls - much to the annoyance of some of his classmates who saw him a teacher 's pet			1
one former student , @entity185 , took a philosophy class with @entity7 - but received a poor mark for an 100 - page final paper			2
