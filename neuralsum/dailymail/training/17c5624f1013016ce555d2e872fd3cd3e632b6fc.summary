a blind father - of - two has seen his twin sons ’ faces for the first time after a surgeon restored his sight - using one of his teeth			1
@entity6 , 43 , first damaged his eye 16 years ago when a piece of scrap metal from an oven struck him in the right eye - ripping his cornea in six places			1
the wound healed but he suffered more problems and eventually lost the sight in his right eye in 1998			2
@entity6 , 43 , lost his sight in 1999 and had never seen his twin sons @entity20 and @entity21			1
last december he had surgery on his left eye which used part of a tooth to help him regain 40 per cent vision in that eye before the pioneering surgery , @entity20 and @entity21 only appeared blurry			1
mr @entity6 said : ' they were just shapes - i could n't make them out			1
now i have my independence back now and can start looking after the kids while my wife is at work ' and just a year later , the former forklift truck driver had lost nearly all the remaining vision in his left eye			1
before the pioneering surgery , mr @entity6 had never seen his four - year - old twins @entity20 and @entity21 ’s faces - instead seeing them as blurry shapes			1
but after the operation on his left eye - which he underwent in december last year - he has regained 40 per cent vision and can now see his children for the first time			1
mr @entity6 , who lives in @entity45 , @entity46 , with his wife @entity48 , 35 , and their twin boys , agreed to have the revolutionary surgery other all other treatments failed			1
the procedure - called @entity53 ( @entity53 ) - involves the reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient ’s own teeth			1
the lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth , which is later implanted in the eye			1
the treatment mr @entity6 had is only suitable for certain types of blindness and can only be performed by one surgeon in @entity70 - @entity69 ( right ) at the @entity71 in @entity72 the procedure - called @entity53 ( @entity53 ) - involves the reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient ’s own teeth			1
the lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth , which is later implanted in the eye			1
and as long as the retina is still functioning , the lens then provides a new window through which the patient is able to see			1
remarkably , because the tooth belongs to the patient , the body does not reject it			1
the treatment is only suitable for certain types of blindness and can only be performed by one surgeon in @entity70 - @entity69 at the @entity71 in @entity72			2

he said : ' i have my independence back now and i can start looking after the children while my wife is out at work			0
' before , the kids were just shapes			0
i could n’t make them out			0
i had to actually learn to tell them apart by their voices			0
i could tell whichever one it was by the way they spoke and sometimes by how quickly they moved			0
' i had a picture in my head of what they looked like but they were better			0
i ’m a bit biased there			0
' the image in my mind was totally different to how they were			0
i gave them a big hug and a kiss			0
' the sight does n’t last forever so at the moment i am just taking each day as it comes and appreciating it			0
mr @entity6 said that before the operation , he had to tell his sons @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) apart by their voices			2
he said : ' i had a picture in my head of what they looked like - but they were better ' in 2009 , @entity138 , 42 , told how he saw his wife for the very first time after going through @entity53 surgery with professor @entity69			2
@entity138 was blinded when a tub of molten aluminium exploded in his face and had never seen care worker @entity145 , 50 , who he married eight years after the accident			0
professor @entity69 said : ' @entity53 is not guaranteed to restore sight but it does have a high success rate			0
' patients who have the surgery are often able to see immediately and the quality of sight can be extraordinarily good			0
' however it is only suitable for certain types of blindness , specifically patients who have severe and irreversible corneal damage			0
the procedure - called @entity53 ( @entity53 ) - involves the reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient ¿ s own teeth			1
the lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth , which is later implanted in the eye ' it is a complex procedure and takes a good five years to master it			1
i began working on it in the mid-nineties under the tutelage of @entity173 , the surgeon who perfected it			0
' it was a big commitment and i had to learn @entity176 in order to work with him			0
' but to be able to restore the sight of someone who has been blind for many years is an immense privilege			2
' mr @entity183 's story of regaining his sight and seeing his twin boys ’ faces for the first time will be shown in a @entity188 documentary ‘ @entity189 ’			0
the programme - which will be shown at 10.35pm next tuesday - was recorded over a seven - month period last year and follows three of professor @entity69 ’s patients .			2

@entity6 , 43 , damaged his eye 16 years ago and went blind in 1999
has now *undergone* pioneering surgery to have a new eye reconstructed
procedure uses a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient ’s own teeth
@entity204 is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth , which is then implanted in the eye - giving him 40 per cent vision
