by @entity0 divorce battle : @entity2 , 49 , said that taking her husband @entity3 , a wealthy @entity4 hotelier to court had been a difficult and painful experience a former model at the centre of a £ 40million divorce battle with her husband has hit back at suggestions that she is a gold digger			1
@entity2 , 49 , a former model and fashion editor at @entity14 , who lives in @entity16 's affluent @entity15 said that taking her husband @entity3 , a wealthy @entity4 hotelier to court had been a ' difficult and painful experience			1
' however , it 's not the first time mrs @entity2 has faced the difficult decision			2
before she married mr @entity22 , 52 , a property tycoon who was worth £ 8 million , she won an eight figure settlement from her first husband @entity24 , the wealthy owner of fashion brand @entity25			1
mr @entity24 is the father of her three children and her split from him was resolved relatively smoothly			0
to pay off mrs @entity2 , mr @entity24 sold £ 40million worth of shares in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in the region of that amount			1
breaking her silence yesterday , mrs @entity2 said that she had flourished through being a ' successful journalist and businesswoman			1
' but she is battling against headlines thanks to her acrimonious divorce battle , which saw her squabbling with husband number two over their £ 45million fortune			2
her second husband is a well - known figure in his native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire , including a boutique hotel in @entity47 and a decades - old restaurant in a quaint village			2
the key bone of contention is a £ 13.8million loan a company owned by @entity2 made to a company owned by mr @entity22			1
naturally , now the couple are no longer together , she wishes her loan to be repaid			0
defiant : @entity22 , left , refuses to return to @entity57 after his wife @entity2 , right , managed to have him jailed chic : the 49 - year - old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight - figure settlement after splitting from mr @entity24 , the co-founder of @entity25 , in 2004 after the couple had three children together last week , at a hearing of the @entity66 of the @entity66 the judge ordered mr @entity22 to be jailed for four months for failing to disclose information about the loan			1
the couple ’s assets include a house in @entity15 and a luxurious property on the @entity74 island of @entity75 , where @entity2 and @entity3 first met not long after her divorce from mr @entity24 in 2004			1
the @entity66 hearing heard that mr @entity22 had a fortune of £ 8million when their relationship began			1
a large chunk of the couple ’s combined fortune is made up of the money @entity2 took from her first divorce			2
but mr @entity22 is currently in @entity4 , and is said to be in no mood to come rushing back to @entity57 to serve his sentence			1
' i ca n’t come to @entity16 , ' he told the @entity89			0
' you do n’t know what it is for me not to go to @entity16 and be condemned to jail			0
' although he refuses to discuss the details of the court case , he claims to have launched rival proceedings in @entity4 against @entity2			1
the couple were married overseas around 2006			0
following their separation , it is understood a decree nisi was issued , but a decree absolute can not be given until a financial settlement has been agreed			0
mrs @entity2 is the daughter of @entity105 and his wife , @entity106 , both hairdressers			2
she was born @entity108 in @entity109 in 1964 but changed her name to @entity111 after her mother ’s marriage to @entity111 in 1973			0
husband number one : @entity2 , pictured with her first husband @entity24 , has had her second husband @entity22 jailed , in a court battle over their £ 45m assets mrs @entity2 has released a statement to complain about ' misleading statements ' about the case			1
in the statement released by her solicitors , she sent out a warning to all newspapers against ' repeating the offensive sugestion that despite being a successful journalist and businesswoman i have somehow made a career out of marrying for money			1
' she added : ' i hope now that all sections of the press will respect our privacy , and that none of the newspapers will seek to capitalise further on this difficult situation			0
' her statement was , in part , a response to unkind mutterings that she is a woman who weighs up a potential husband ’s suitability according to the size of his wallet			0
‘ it did n’t go unnoticed that she took @entity24 to the cleaners , ’ says one who knows her			0
‘ she told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did			0
there are no feelings of warmth between @entity2 and @entity24 now — just loathing			2
‘ no one was surprised when @entity2 married another multi-millionaire			0
she has an uncanny way of latching on to money			0
i think @entity3 was probably warned , but sadly paid no attention			0

@entity2 , 49 , said she is a ' successful journalist and businesswoman '
her first husband founded fashion empire @entity25
he sold £ 40m of company shares to pay for his divorce from her
she claims she loaned second husband £ 13.8m and wants it repaid
he was ordered to be jailed for contempt of court after *hiding* his assets
mr @entity22 has sent out a warning to newspapers over *coverage* of the story
