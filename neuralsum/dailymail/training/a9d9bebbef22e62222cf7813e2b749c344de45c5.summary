@entity0 has revealed he is ‘ extremely hopeful ’ that rival businessmen @entity1 and @entity3 will join forces to save troubled @entity5 from fresh financial chaos			1
@entity1 jetted into @entity7 earlier this week to address the @entity9 board on his £ 16million rescue package			1
the @entity12 - based millionaire , who has teamed up with @entity13 and wealthy fan @entity14 , spent around two hours spelling out his plans for investment which would also secure a 51 per cent stake in the club			2
@entity3 , in the meantime , is trying to push through his own change and wants an egm that would remove @entity1 allies @entity22 and @entity24 from their posts			1
@entity5 manager @entity0 ( c ) takes part in a training session at @entity28 @entity0 is optimistic that business rivals @entity1 and @entity3 can join forces to save the club @entity0 , however , remains optimistic the warring factions can strike a peace deal and secure the future of the @entity36 giants			1
‘ i ’m delighted that now , for the first time , we have a serious opportunity of investment from a couple of areas , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been well documented that @entity3 has increased his shareholding and it has been well documented there has been a series of meetings with @entity1 ’s team and the board			1
‘ i would be extremely hopeful that a compromise and a deal can be done , involving all parties , allowing us to move forward			0
‘ if you are asking me whether i ’d rather take two investors instead of one , or two instead of three , then i would obviously go for the greater amount of investment			2
‘ i do n’t really know both personalities and i do n’t know exactly what they want but i would imagine if they could work together it would increase investment			0
‘ so it would make sense to say if you have two great businessmen on board then it is better than one great businessman			0
’ @entity69 owner @entity3 ( r ) has increased his shareholding at the @entity9 club , despite fan 's protests @entity3 ’s increased involvement has proven unpopular with @entity5 fans who last weekend staged protests at his sports direct stores after objecting to his growing influence at the club – with more ‘ flash mob ’ activities planned for coming weeks			1
it makes @entity0 ’s declaration on friday that he would back an @entity84 ‘ dream team ’ all the more noteworthy			1
‘ i spoke to @entity1 on the phone before his meeting , ’ he said			1
‘ as you know i go back with @entity1 from the previous time he was on the board			1
‘ all he told me was that he was in meetings with the board			0
he has n’t told me anything confidential in terms of the business side of things			0
former director @entity1 has started negotiations over a £ 16million rescue package ‘ he said he was hopeful of pushing things forward			1
he said he was very , very keen to get a deal done that will push the club forward			2
other than that there was no indication of what the meetings where about and i have n’t spoken to him since			0
‘ @entity22 has n’t put a specific timescale on it , but he was also hopeful that something would be sorted out sooner rather than later			2
‘ i ’ve said all along that at some point in the near future we are going to need investment in the club			2
‘ you hear concerns about money running out and people not getting wages			0
that has never been said to us at all , but in terms of the team and club , whether it is @entity28 , @entity9 or strengthening the team we will definitely need investment			1
‘ the more investment we can get the better and now we have two fantastically respected businessmen hovering about the club with a view to taking it forward			2
’ @entity0 insists that the only certainty regarding @entity5 ' future is that the club needs investment @entity0 however warned @entity3 that his attempts to oust @entity22 at an egm would cause further instability			1
‘ of course it ’s a concern , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve had more chief executives and potential owners in the last three years than we have done in the previous 30 years			0
‘ what would be concerning would be that it would create uncertainty and instability again with more changes at boardroom level			0
that would n’t be ideal			0
but that ’s totally and 100 percent outwith my control			0
