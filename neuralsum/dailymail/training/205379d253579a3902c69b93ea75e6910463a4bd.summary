comes after it emerged 114 files had been lost by @entity3 officials by @entity4 failure to report suspected child sex abuse could become a criminal offence , @entity5 revealed yesterday			1
the home secretary ’s announcement came as , bowing to growing pressure , she agreed to a sweeping inquiry into allegations of paedophilia in @entity15 circles			1
the @entity17 - style investigation will look into the activities of churches , hospitals , schools , political parties and the @entity23			1
it has been prompted by claims of a cover - up after it emerged that 114 files had been lost by @entity3 officials			1
the home secretary suggested that the main inquiry could examine the work of party whips who are said to hold ‘ little black books ’ containing damaging information against colleagues they want to control			2
an expert panel will be able to call witnesses from the private sector as well as the @entity55 – and pore over secret files kept on prominent figures by the security services and whips			2
more than 150 @entity60 had backed calls for a wide - ranging inquiry following appalling allegations against @entity64 and the unmasking of @entity66 as a prolific sex offender			1
campaigning @entity69 mp @entity68 said : ‘ i ’m in no doubt that there are @entity72 , just a handful , who will be worried about where these inquiries are going – no doubt about that			0
’ announcing a probe to be headed by a senior figure yet to be appointed – probably a retired judge – mrs may said : ‘ where there has been a failure to protect children from abuse , we will expose it and we will learn from it			2
’ more than 150 mps had backed calls for a wide - ranging inquiry following appalling allegations against @entity64 ( pictured ) and the unmasking of @entity66 as a prolific sex offender campaigning @entity69 mp @entity68 said : ' i 'm in no doubt that there are @entity72 , just a handful , who will be worried about where these inquiries are going - no doubt about that ' mrs may told former @entity103 cabinet minister @entity102 the inquiry will examine the case for introducing a ‘ mandatory reporting ’ law in the @entity108			1
it would apply in schools , hospitals , churches , or sports clubs operated by a national body			1
similar laws exist in @entity116 , @entity117 , the @entity118 and @entity119			0
they impose a legal duty on professionals such as teachers , social workers , police and doctors to report suspicions of abuse or face legal action			2
mrs may ’s announcement follows months of resistance from ministers and stops just short of the full judicial inquiry , with sessions held in public , that some campaigners demanded			1
like the investigation into the @entity17 , it will be a non-statutory inquiry but it will have the power to call witnesses			1
the home secretary said it would be converted into a full public inquiry if its chairman felt at any point it was necessary , and will not report before the next general election			2
she told @entity60 the inquiry would be able to access all government and local authority paperwork it wants to – and suggested its head would be cleared to review security service files which might contain incriminating evidence against powerful individuals			1
@entity69 mp @entity155 raised remarks by the late @entity103 mp @entity157 , a whip in @entity160 ’s @entity159 between 1970 and 1973			2
he said in a 1995 documentary that @entity60 in trouble would ask for help , adding : ‘ it might be debt , it might be … a scandal involving small boys … if we could get a chap out of trouble then , he will do as we ask forever more			0
’ the review led by mr @entity32 centres on concerns the @entity3 failed to act on allegations of child sex abuse contained in a dossier handed over in the 1980s by former @entity103 mp @entity175			1
then home secretary @entity176 – now @entity177 – @entity178 says he passed them to the @entity3 but last week said they had been mislaid			1
@entity180 said : ‘ we are going to leave no stone unturned to find out the truth			0
three things need to happen : robust inquiries that get to truth ; police investigations that pursue the guilty and find out what has happened ; and proper lessons learned so we make sure these things can not happen again			0
’ mr @entity68 said : ‘ i am pleased the government has shifted its position significantly in the last few days			0
‘ i hope that the inquiry will have powers to hold the intelligence services and special branch to account where investigations into powerful child abusers have been discontinued or blocked			1
i also hope it will give an amnesty for retired and serving officers to give evidence on what they know about @entity15 paedophiles without fear of losing their pension or other repercussions			0
’ former @entity69 minister @entity212 backed the proposed change in the law , saying : ‘ mandatory reporting is a policy that has to be taken seriously now			0
this is particularly critical when children are under the care of those institutional settings like schools , nurseries and children ’s homes			1
’ conservative mp dr @entity224 said sex abuse victims who might give evidence tneeded to be protected from blackmail			2
‘ i gather that there are general concerns around the potential use of photographs and films from the 1970s and ’ 80s which have now been digitised in order to discourage victims from coming forward , ’ he said			0
the inquiry into historical child sex abuse is expected to last at least two years and cost millions of pounds			1
the @entity17 - style panel of independent experts will initially be tasked with trawling over mountains of evidence of how children were not properly protected from sexual predators			0
its powers will be similar to those granted to the two - year @entity250			2
that panel , headed by the @entity252 the @entity254 @entity253 , analysed more than 400,000 documents before producing in 2012 a stinging report on police attempts to cover up their failings during the tragedy			0
the @entity17 panel , headed by the @entity252 the @entity254 @entity253 ( pictured ) , analysed more than 400,000 documents before producing in 2012 a stinging report on police attempts to cover up their failings during the tragedy for the child abuse probe , full access will be granted to all government papers , including letters to and from ministers , minutes of meetings and any intelligence compiled by @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 on paedophile mps and diplomats			1
scores of witnesses are expected to be called to give evidence in public – though , unlike at the @entity281 into phone hacking , they will not swear an oath			0
if the panel ’s powers prove inadequate or witnesses refuse to attend , it will be upgraded to a full statutory public inquiry that can force compliance			1
a public inquiry , involving armies of lawyers , could cost tens of millions			2
@entity295 cost taxpayers almost £ 5.5million			0
the independent panel will not be ready to begin work for weeks or report back before the @entity298 in may 2015 but will give an update to @entity300 before then			0
for days , senior ministers had been resisting demands from more than 130 mps for a wide - ranging inquiry into child sex abuse , insisting it would interfere with ongoing police inquiries			1
but , following days of political pressure , mrs may performed a sharp u-turn in the @entity311			2
in a sign of how hurriedly the government had changed its position , mrs may was unable to set out any terms of reference for the inquiry – though officials insist this will take place within days			1
she was also unable to say who would take charge , other than to say it would be an ‘ experienced and senior figure ’			0
but mrs may said the panel would be given huge scope to go wherever the evidence took them , no matter how far in the past			0
officials said its inquiries could extend to the @entity331 and @entity332 – both of which have been dogged by sex scandals dating back to the 1960s and have been repeatedly accused of cover - up			0
other bodies which will be asked to hand over paperwork and give evidence include political parties , @entity342 departments , schools , hospitals , councils , social services departments , the private sector and the @entity23			1
mps repeatedly pressed mrs may over whether the panel will have access to material gathered by the intelligence services , which allegedly kept files on suspected @entity355 paedophiles , including @entity64			0
the home secretary said , where possible , all government papers would be released , including those written by spies			0
she said that , where national security was an issue , special arrangements may have to be made			0

@entity369 will look into churches , hospitals , schools , political parties and @entity23
separate inquiry will review an investigation conducted last year into the @entity3 ’s handling of historical child abuse allegations
comes after it emerged 114 files had been lost by @entity3 officials
