@entity1 could be hit ' at any moment ' by a @entity4 - style terror attack , @entity0 told @entity5 last night			1
the prime minister said the @entity8 attack , in which two hostages died and @entity12 extremist man @entity10 was killed , was a reminder of the danger @entity1 faces			1
he said it was only through the efforts of the security services that plots to murder @entity1 police officers ‘ in cold blood ’ had been foiled in recent months			1
prime minister @entity0 said @entity8 was a country ' very close to our hearts ' , and warned the attack in @entity4 could be repeated in the @entity1 mr @entity0 told @entity5 on the @entity23 that the threat @entity1 faced ' definitely ' included lone - wolf attacks like in @entity4 but he warned it was much harder for the authorities to prevent attacks by fanatics who are ‘ self - radicalised on the internet ’ than to tackle known extremists who had travelled to the @entity31			1
the prime minister , appearing before senior mps at the @entity34 , said : ‘ the threat we face definitely includes those sort of self - starting , sometimes quite random attacks that could happen at any moment in @entity1			1
‘ we ’ve seen over the last few months there have been a series of plots that have been detected and prevented that would have seen police officers or other authorities murdered in cold blood			1
‘ it ’s thanks to the brilliance of our security services that these things have been prevented			0
’ but he added : ‘ we ca n’t count on them to prevent it every time because it is one thing understanding the terror networks coming out of @entity58 or @entity59 or @entity60 and @entity61 , trying to monitor what they ’re doing , who ’s going and who ’s returning			0
‘ but people who are self - radicalised on the internet , who then suddenly do appalling things , that is much more difficult to prevent			0
’ the prime minister 's remarks come amid widespread horror at the twin terror attacks in @entity4 and @entity58 which have left more than hundred people dead			1
in @entity4 , the @entity77 asylum seeker @entity10 struck terror into the heart of the city 's financial district after taking 17 staff and customers hostages inside the @entity86 cafe in @entity87 for 16 hours			1
the 50 - year - old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots , which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the café at 2am on tuesday			0
@entity93 , the café manager , and barrister mother - of - three @entity95 were the two hostages killed during the bloody climax to the stand - off			1
the tragedy came before @entity101 gunmen stormed a school in @entity58 and slaughtered 132 children today			0
the 34 - year - old manager of the @entity86 cafe , @entity93 ( left ) , and mother of three @entity95 , 38 ( right ) , have been named as the two hostages killed during the @entity4 siege on tuesday morning convoys of @entity1 and @entity112 military hardware being shipped back from @entity59 could face attack by terrorists , it is feared			1
thousands of vehicles and containers of equipment are being brought home as part of the withdrawal of @entity122 combat troops			0
some will be transported by land and sea , via @entity58			0
but one of the main routes to the port of @entity128 is through @entity129 , the scene of yesterday ’s @entity101 attack			0
a second , more southerly route goes via the city of @entity134 , a base for the @entity59 @entity101 that has been plagued by sectarian violence			0
speaking before the siege in @entity8 came to an end yesterday mr @entity0 warned that the tragedy may have been played out more than 10,000 miles away , but it could be repeated in @entity1			1
the security services have warned ministers that an attack in the @entity1 from such a fanatic is ‘ almost inevitable ’			0
@entity144 , the director of @entity145 , warned last year that @entity1 was facing a grave terror threat , including from ‘ several thousand ’ @entity148 extremists who are living here and want to attack the country			1
in august , the @entity1 ’s threat level was raised from ‘ substantial ’ to ‘ severe ’ amid increasing concerns that hundreds of jihadis were returning to @entity1 streets from the wars in @entity60 and @entity61			2
last week , police forces across @entity1 were put on alert after a warning of an @entity148 plot to kidnap and behead an officer			2
more than 7,000 officers in the @entity162 – the @entity1 ’s second - largest force – were warned they were in imminent danger following a telephone threat			1
it follows last year ’s savage murder of soldier @entity168 in broad daylight			0
there are also fears that hundreds of people are being radicalised in @entity1 prisons			0
the soldier was murdered by two @entity175 converts who ambushed him as he walked back to his barracks in @entity178 , @entity179 , last year			0
mr @entity0 called on @entity175 communities in @entity1 to do more to stand up , oppose extremists and say they are ‘ not speaking in my name ’			1
he suggested the perception of @entity175 as ‘ victims ’ must be challenged as part of efforts to stamp out radicalism			0
gunman man @entity10 , pictured here protesting charges against him earlier this year , held 17 people hostage in the @entity86 cafe he admitted it was a ‘ worry ’ so many people seemed to be being radicalised in public institutions such as schools			1
but he said the @entity198 ’s proposed new duty on figures of authority to report concerns about radicalisation could help to address the problem			0
the prime minister told @entity205 : ' obviously it 's an extremely worrying situation			2
it demonstrates the challenge we face of @entity148 extremist violence all over the world			2
@entity213 police chief sir @entity212 warned of the threat posed by lone wolf attacks ' this is on the other side of the world but is the sort of thing that could just as well happen here in the @entity1 or in @entity222			1
' he said @entity8 was a country ' very close to our hearts ' , adding : ' we very much stand with the @entity8 at their time of need			0
it is a reminder of the threat that we face and the need to be vigilant			0
' police and security officials have warned it is ' almost inevitable ' that @entity1 will be hit by an attack by fanatics who have been ' militarised ' by @entity237			2
mr @entity0 announced last month that an extra £ 130million will be made available over the next two years for the security services to ' monitor and disrupt those self - starting terrorists '			1
a new legal obligation will be imposed on universities , prisons , councils and schools to play their part in tackling ' this poisonous extremism ' , the prime minister said			2
mr @entity0 told @entity5 : ' the reason for providing some extra money today is that there is a specific and growing challenge from these self - starting — they are sometimes called ' lone wolf ' — jihadis , who have been radicalised on the internet because of what has been happening in @entity61 but are not necessarily linked up with other terrorist networks			1
' that puts extra pressure on and we need to respond to that			0
' the security agencies face unprecedented pressure to prevent similar attacks by extremists acting alone , but it is much harder to detect and disrupt plots if they are not part of a wider terror network			2
@entity213 police chief sir @entity212 warned : ' it does n't take an awful lot of organising , does n't take too many to conspire together , there 's no great complexity to it			0
' so that means we have got a very short time to interdict , to actually intervene and make sure that these people do n't get away with it			0
' unveiling new laws to counter the extremist threat , home secretary @entity282 revealed 40 terrorists plots have been thwarted in @entity1 since the july 7 attacks nine years ago			1
the foiled atrocities including ' marauding ' ' @entity290 - style ' gun attacks streets , an attempt to blow up the @entity292 and airplanes , and murder troops and a @entity1 ambassador			2
unveiling a raft of new counter-terror measures in november , the home secretary warned the threat to @entity1 is ' greater than it ever has been ' and stressed the terrorists ' only have to be lucky once ' .			2

prime minister says series of plots ' have been detected and prevented '
attacks would have seen @entity1 police officers ' murdered in cold blood '
two hostages killed and @entity12 extremist man @entity10 shot dead
@entity0 warns it demonstrates the terror threat all over the world
@entity1 government finds an extra £ 130million to counter ' lone wolf ' attacks
