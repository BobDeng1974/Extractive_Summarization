in the grim aftermath of @entity3 's mauling in @entity4 , @entity0 was asked by a reporter whether the manner of his side 's capitulation had shocked him			1
' i am not shocked , ' came the stern response , delivered with an uncompromising eye - lock glare			1
@entity12 genuinely was n't shocked , and nor was he especially worried , since the experience of his coaching career has taught him that in order to achieve success , you must first work through the ' process			1
we are building up a team and you can not make it in one month			0
' the @entity46 is a notoriously slow starter in new jobs and new seasons			1
what we saw at @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , we are currently seeing at @entity3			1
in fact , he is such a slow starter that the superb form seen on @entity3 's pre-season tour of the @entity58 seemed too good to be true			1
and so it has proved , with @entity3 collecting just one point from a possible six in the @entity61 and exiting the @entity28 before the point they would normally enter it			1
but @entity3 fans should not be concerned			1
it will be all right in the end , as a glance back at @entity12 's career proves			1
when he arrived at @entity53 in 2009 , @entity12 described them as his ' dream club ' but things soon turned into a bit of a nightmare			1
they started with back - to - back draws against @entity75 and @entity76 before slumping to defeat at @entity77			0
they won only five of their opening 13 matches and by the end of november they were 8th			0
recovery : @entity12 started slowly when he took over at @entity53 in 2009 but went on to win the league leg - end : @entity12 shows off his knees as @entity53 celebrate their 2010 @entity88 triumph lift it high : @entity53 were eighth at the end of november but then went unbeaten until march to secure the title august 30 @entity91 ( a ) september 14 @entity92 ( @entity34 ) september 21 @entity93 ( a ) september 27 @entity94 ( @entity34 ) october 5 @entity95 ( @entity34 ) october 20 @entity96 ( a ) @entity98 to this was a dreadful start to their @entity101 campaign , with home and away defeats by @entity103 leaving them staring at an early exit and @entity12 fighting for his job			1
he responded in typically ebullient fashion ahead of a trip to @entity110 in late october			0
repeatedly describing himself as a ' @entity112 ' ( ' process manager ' ) , @entity12 laid down the law : ' i am at @entity53 , either you give me time or you do n't			1
' @entity53 won 2 - 1 at @entity110 and remained unbeaten until late march , hitting the summit of the table just after the winter break			2
they won the title by five points and recovered from their shaky start to reach the final of the @entity101			0
@entity12 was vindicated , his ' process ' , once seen through to its end , was a successful one			0
when he guided unfashionable @entity52 to the @entity128 title in 2009 , the season started with back - to - back defeats by @entity130 and @entity131			0
they promptly went 28 matches unbeaten and won the league by 11 points			0
repeat : @entity12 's @entity52 also started slowly in 2008 - 2009 but they went on to claim the title dwarfed : it took @entity12 some time to convince the fans at @entity51 that he was the right man for the job protest : fans at the @entity141 called for @entity12 to be dismissed as results did n't go their way at @entity51 , he dismayed pretty much everyone at the club by trying to enforce his philosophy , which was completely different to the club 's			1
@entity12 asked star man @entity148 to play on the left wing rather than through the middle , leading to rows in the camp and the fans getting on his back			0
at the end of his first season , many remained unhappy , as @entity158 recorded in his book , @entity51 : a people 's passion : ' the jury is out on @entity12 , a @entity46 lacking the humanity of @entity164 and the popularity of @entity166 , both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years			1
' @entity51 may be at the top of the league , but the fans are unconvinced			2
they have watched the team pathetically founder in @entity175 , while continuing to play lacklustre football in the @entity61 , winning seemingly by default rather than design			2
' but you could n't argue with the results - well , eventually			0
the following year , @entity51 found themselves 10th in @entity181 in early december and at one stage they lost four on the bounce			2
upset : @entity12 did not make himself popular by trying to move @entity51 hero @entity148 making his case : @entity12 presents the @entity51 squad during his second spell in charge when things finally clicked , @entity51 won 19 of their next 24 games , winning the title by a commanding 11 - point margin			1
it all came right in the end			0
and this pattern dates right back to the beginning of his managerial career , when he was named manager of @entity50 against all the odds back in 1991			1
though a managerial novice , @entity12 was a disciplinarian and his methods certainly ruffled a few feathers			0
he fell out with leading players @entity204 , @entity206 and @entity207 va n't schip by tinkering with their positions on the field			0
and when @entity50 took just 20 points from their first 16 games , @entity12 had to endure the fans calling for club legend @entity166 to replace him			2
vindicated : @entity12 struggled initially at @entity50 but he eventually delivered the @entity101 ' i will not change my attitude , ' @entity12 said			1
he did n't , and his time in @entity217 yielded three @entity46 league titles , the @entity219 and the @entity101 in 1995			2
so history tells us that @entity12 will stubbornly stick to his methods at @entity3			2
we may see some teething troubles with the 3 - 5 - 2 formation and certain players will have to adapt			0
we may also see things getting worse before they get better - @entity3 could not be near the top four come the turn of the year			2
but history also informs us that , once the ' process ' is seen through , @entity12 will deliver success			0
slow starts to silverware are his speciality			0
@entity51 ( first spell ) 1997 - 98 : 2nd after 14 matches ( finished 1st ) 1998 - 99 : 10th after 14 matches ( finished 1st ) @entity51 ( @entity238 spell ) 2002 - 03 : 13th after 14 matches ( sacked in january with the club 12th			0
) @entity52 2005 - 06 : 3rd after 13 matches ( finished 2nd ) 2006 - 07 : 3rd after 13 matches ( finished 3rd ) 2007 - 08 : 10th after 13 matches ( finished 11th ) 2008 - 09 : 4th after 11 matches ( finished 1st ) - opening defeats to @entity130 and @entity131 @entity53 2009 - 2010 : 7th after 13 matches ( finished 1st ) 2010 - 2011 : 8th after 13 matches ( sacked in april with the club 4th			0

@entity3 have gained just one point from six in @entity61
and they were *dumped* out of @entity28 by @entity22
but @entity0 was not shocked by the slow start
@entity46 has a track record of starting slowly in new jobs
happened at @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity53 during his career
but the manager always delivered success in the end
