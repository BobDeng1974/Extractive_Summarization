at first glance , it is all the fun of the circus as performing monkeys dressed as children ride on a scooter , jump through a hoop and stand on their hands in front of a cheering crowd			1
but the gaiety of the show on a brightly - lit stage in @entity14 belies the barbaric treatment the animals have endured behind the scenes to ensure their tricks are faultless			1
their ' training ' has been cruelty in the extreme - seeing the monkeys chained in tiny cages , dragged around on leashes and yanked up in ‘ hanging style ’ by their necks , with their arms forced above their heads and behind their backs			1
above , the monkeys ride on a scooter and sit at desks squalid conditions : their ' training ' has been cruelty in the extreme - seeing the monkeys chained in tiny cages in pain : a secret video shot at ' @entity66 ' shows one of the performing monkeys screaming in anguish scared : none of the animals are allowed happiness in @entity66 - not even a mother and her baby ( left ) - as they all await the next beating to ensure they learn their roles for the crowds who will later watch the show a secret video shot at ‘ @entity66 ’ in @entity14 by @entity83 - based @entity82 ( @entity82 ) reveals a horrifying attitude to animals - a callousness that the organisation sadly admits is universal to the performing animals industry			1
‘ it is hard to imagine a worse life for these poor animals , ’ said @entity89 , spokesman for @entity82			1
‘ the only time these intelligent and sensitive animals were let out of their cages was to be abused during training or to perform tricks in front of the crowd			2
’ the footage shows monkeys living in squalid conditions in cramped cages , pushing their hands out as if begging for release - and one even attempts to work the padlock free on its cage			1
shocking : footage shows a monkey being dragged away by its neck - with its hands tied tightly behind its back barbaric : the animal falls over during the harsh treatment , before it is dragged upward again by the trainer dangerous : the treatment appears to come dangerously close to the animals being choked to death or having their spinal cords severed			1
‘ it is hard to imagine a worse life for these poor animals , ’ said an @entity82 spokesman a trainer can be seen hauling a monkey , with a leash around its neck , up on its hind legs and forcing its arms above its head			1
its hands are then tied behind its back and , as it begins to run away in sheer terror , it falls heavily on its face - its screeches and screams mingled with the laughter of the trainers			1
once caught , it is hauled up with its feet above the ground and dragged away by its neck , treatment that appeared to come dangerously close to the animal being choked to death or having its spinal cord severed			0

one animal is seen sadly sucking its thumb as it peers out through the wire of its cage			0
none are allowed happiness in @entity66 - not even a mother and her baby - as they all await the next beating to ensure they learn their roles for the crowds who will pay later to watch their stage performance			0
hiding in fear : @entity82 says world - wide protests and pleas to the people of @entity14 to boycott cruel monkey shows could help shut down such heartless ' training ' schools			2
above , a scared monkey hides from its trainers recaptured : the people behind the performances , says @entity82 ceo @entity202 , ' show no understanding or sympathy for the terror they produce '			0
above , the animal is dragged out from its hiding place by trainers escape : the monkeys are only ' freed ' when they are brought from their cages , dressed as children and led to the show in which they are the cowed stars			2
above , the monkey frantically runs away from its trainers they push their hands out through the wire as if begging for freedom but a tragic representation of that will only come when they are brought from their cages , dressed in children ’s clothes and led to the show in which they are the cowed stars			2
they sit upright on stools , like children in kindergarten , before standing unnaturally , bolt upright on their hind legs			0
one rides around on a three - wheeled bike , another leaps through a hoop and then as a grand finale , they stand on their hands as their stick - wielding trainer keeps them in line			0
