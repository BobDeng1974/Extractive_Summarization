by @entity0 @entity2 rebel @entity1 has said the chancellor should commit should institute a higher tax - free transfers for married people @entity6 should promise large - scale and costly new tax breaks for married couples , a senior @entity2 said yesterday			1
the chancellor should commit to a transferable tax allowance for married people worth the whole of their £ 10,500 income tax - free allowance , former @entity10 chairman @entity1 said			1
this would give vital support to marriage and the family and bring help to stay at home mothers			2
next year ‘ the chancellor must use his final budget of this @entity24 to rebalance the tax system and remove the bias against families ’ , he said			1
‘ the importance of marriage and family to our children ’s well - being needs to be recognised , ’ he added			1
the call by mr @entity1 – beaten by mr @entity35 in the 2005 @entity2 leadership election – is his second challenge in a week			2
it follows his demand that the prime minister open talks with @entity42 on @entity44 ’s exit from the @entity45			2
tax support for married families and full - time mothers has been a regular theme on the @entity2 right and some mps are unhappy mr @entity35 has done no more than offer a transferable tax allowance worth less than £ 200 to some married couples			1
under that tax break , which will apply from april next year and help only basic - rate taxpayers , couples will be able to transfer £ 1,000 of their tax - free allowance to their partner			2
mr @entity1 ’s more sweeping proposal would apply to all married people , including those earning over the higher - rate tax threshold of £ 41,865			1
it would mean a husband whose wife was looking after children and transferred her tax allowance to him would be able to earn £ 21,000 before having to pay any income tax at all			0
mr @entity1 said that in 1990 , when the system was changed to tax people as individuals rather than as families , the intention had been that those who did not use their tax - free allowance should be able to transfer it to their spouse			1
but the transferable allowance had never been introduced			0
@entity1 says that the chancellor should use his final budget next year to rebalance tax systems and stop bias on married couples in the tax system since then the threshold for paying tax has risen for single people with no responsibilities but hardly changed for families , mr @entity1 said			1
writing on the conservative woman website , he added : ‘ the bias against single - earner families is particularly severe			0
’ despite evidence marriage underpins more stable families the government offers them no support , he said			0
in some cases a family can grow its income from £ 12,000 a year to £ 20,000 , but have little more money to spend			0
‘ this produces a disincentive to aspiration , ’ mr @entity1 said			0
‘ the conservatives should pledge to increase the transferable amount until the entire tax - free allowance , raised to £ 10,500 in the last budget , is transferable , as should have happened when the taxation system was changed almost a quarter of a century ago			0
’ he said this would be expensive but should become a long - term aim			0
‘ when the personal allowance is fully transferable the state will be truly neutral on family decisions about whether parents go out to work , ’ he said .			0

@entity1 says that tax breaks should be larger for married couples
@entity122 says chancellor should use budget to ' rebalance ' @entity44 economy
he *believes* the importance of marriage and family needs to be recognised
