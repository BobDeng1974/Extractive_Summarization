by @entity0 victims of ‘ non-threatening ’ crimes such as burglaries , thefts , and simple assault in @entity6 will no longer be visited by officers when they call 911			1
@entity6 police are now enforcing an austere new measure where officers are not dispatched to scenes where the offender has fled and where no one is in immediate danger			1
the @entity6 is in the middle of both a crime and budget crisis , with sprees of violence erupting , even as first responders are forced to drastically slash their budgets			1
the measures went into effect on sunday			2
mayor @entity42 and @entity44 superintendent @entity43 said that this dramatic shift would free up as many as 200 officers from compiling paperwork to being out on a beat			1
@entity43 also said that unnecessary 911 calls – including reporting dogs barking and parents complaining their kids wo n’t eat their vegetables – are putting an unnecessary drain on the system			1
he said that as it stands , @entity6 officers respond to around 70 percent of 911 calls , as opposed to around 30 percent for other cities			1
he said at a recent press conference : ‘ i do n’t mean to be flippant here , because i ’ve been the victim of a burglary at least three or four times			2
i ’d rather have the officer on the street , where he can prevent the shooting			0
’ the news comes as @entity6 faces a violent crime epidemic , with nearly 50 homicides and 170 shootings already this year , and had 506 murders in 2012			1
included in those numbers was 15 - year - old @entity73 , a student and band majorette who was guilty of no crime			0
@entity79 , which has a population roughly three times the size of the @entity83 city , had a 2012 murder rate of 414 people			2
but @entity86 are n’t happy about the new change			0
‘ i think that ’s ridiculous , ’ one resident told @entity89			0
‘ i think if there ’s a burglary , they ’ve got to come			0
it ’s what we pay for			0
@entity43 , pictured at a news conference yesterday , said that he is using difficult measures to keep the city 's crime in check task force : the announcement comes as @entity6 is fighting a gun war and is trying to get rifles and other assault weapons off of the @entity6 's streets @entity110			1
@entity43 later said that his job was n’t to make people feel better , it was making tough decisions for the greater good of the city			0
for crimes like robberies , garage burglaries , and property damage , no cop will be dispatched unless the suspect is still on - scene and there is still a present danger for those around			0
otherwise , calls will be fielded by officers on light duty , who will then file a report .			2

new measures will allow officers to work on beats rather than filing paperwork , police superintendent says
before , police responded to 70 **%** of 911 calls in person ; for other cities , average *hovers* around 30 **%**
@entity6 is experiencing spike in gun violence , with more than *40* homicides in 2013 and 500 in 2012
