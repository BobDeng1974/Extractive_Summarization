by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:01 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:32 est , 31 december 2013 daring artist @entity3 - otherwise known as the ' @entity4 ' - has filmed her very risqué painting process			1
covering her 30d breasts in paint , the @entity7 jiggles and swishes her bosoms across a stretched canvas to create an abstract picture			1
the eye - catching pieces have been bought by celebrities such as @entity16 and @entity17 , and now @entity3 lifts the lid on how she paints them in two exclusive videos			1
@entity3 has five methods she favours : the whole breast print ; nipple print ; ' just the tip ' method ; the ' squish and swirl ' and her newest method which she calls the ' titty twerk '			1
she then sells her breast pieces online with some fetching up to $ 500 ( £ 300 )			0
since creating her first painting in 2006 , @entity3 , from @entity7 , @entity44 , has created thousands of pieces which she sells from her online shop			1
' my art is meant to be intimate , erotic , explorative and unique with a hint of whimsy - i call it chaotic yet contained abstraction , ' she says			0
' i began painting with my boobs after viewing a performance artist drip paint over her naked body and roll around on a large canvas sheet			0
' for her the art was about public display however i was intrigued by some of the marks left behind by her painted body			0
she uses a mixture of colours and angles her breasts in different directions and shapes to paint ' her performance led me to my experimentation and my artist niche was born			0
my biggest influences in the art world are @entity73 and @entity74			0
@entity3 donates a portion of all sales to the @entity26 for their fight against breast cancer			2
she also creates specially commissioned work in her unique style			0
' my paintings have been shipped all over the world - from the @entity83 to @entity84 and can be found in almost every @entity44 state , ' she says			0
' some of the more well known owners of my work include people such as @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity89			2
@entity16 and @entity17 have both bought pieces from @entity3 since starting out in 2006 , @entity3 , from @entity7 , has sold many paintings , worth around £ 300 each ' my art is meant to be intimate , erotic , explorative and unique with a hint of whimsy ' explains @entity3 ' i like to mix up my styles so have a good variety - the ' squish and swirl ' method is the one i use the most which involves using both breasts squishing and swirling the paint onto the canvas			1
' my newest style which is proving popular is the ' tittie twerk ' where the canvas is primed in a solid colour and while it 's still wet i use just about a quarter of my breast covered in paint and sort of jiggle it around			2
' it 's not hard to spot which method @entity3 has used to paint these particular pieces ( clue : it 's the whole breast print ) @entity3 , who paints using only her breasts , boasts celebrity fans including @entity16 and @entity17			1

@entity3 from @entity7 covers her 30d bosom in pigment
