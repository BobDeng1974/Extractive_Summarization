@entity1 striker @entity0 returns to @entity2 on monday night , seven years after his first visit to @entity4			1
taking on @entity5 as the @entity7 's top scorer in 2014 - having netted 20 times this calendar year - @entity0 will be keen to add to his tally against the club who rejected him			1
the @entity15 international spent two weeks on trial with @entity17 's @entity5 in 2007 but failed to impress and was not offered a contract			1
@entity1 striker @entity0 returns to @entity2 on monday , seven years after his first visit to @entity5 former @entity5 boss @entity20 had @entity0 on trial in 2007 but decided against signing the young striker having failed to impress @entity5 , @entity0 earned a move to @entity24 in the @entity25 later that year @entity0 caught the eye of @entity7 clubs after scoring 46 goals in 65 matches for @entity31 side @entity30 @entity0 - 20 @entity32 - 18 @entity33 - 17 @entity34 - 16 @entity35 - 14 @entity36 - 13 however , eventually earning a move to @entity38 with @entity24 , @entity0 proved his credentials in front of goal with the @entity25 giants before finally catching the eye of @entity7 clubs with 46 goals in 65 league matches for @entity47 side @entity30			1
joining @entity1 for Â£ 12million in 2013 , @entity0 has since become one of the @entity51 top flight 's most lethal marksmen			2
having scored against @entity5 during the @entity54 ' 4 - 3 defeat last season , @entity0 admits it was nice to find the back of the net against the club who decided against signing him as a teenager			2
striker @entity0 scored on his return to @entity2 during @entity1 's 4 - 3 defeat to @entity5 last season @entity0 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates during the @entity7 clash on @entity4 in february speaking to the @entity68 , @entity0 said : ' i scored there [ against @entity5 at @entity2 ] last season and it was nice because i had been on trial there when i was younger			1
i was there for two weeks in 2007 when @entity20 was the manager			0
' they wanted to see what sort of a player i was and it was amazing as a young guy to get the chance to use facilities like that and to see a stadium like that			0
' i remember sitting up in the stand there watching a game and i enjoyed the chance to go and play there because it was my first experience of @entity51 football			0
' it is always nice to score at places where you have been and you were not able to make it			0
it 's not that you have a particular point to prove , you always have a point to prove in football , but it is nice			0
' @entity0 admits it was ' nice ' to score against @entity5 having failed to make the grade during his trial at @entity2 now 26 , @entity0 was in fact the subject of interest from @entity5 during the summer transfer window and how @entity106 ' side could do with the @entity54 frontman they will come up against on monday			1
without last season 's dynamic striking duo of @entity110 and @entity36 - the former now a @entity112 player and the latter sidelined through injury - @entity5 have managed to find the net just 22 times this season			0
compare that to the 44 goals the @entity118 had scored at the same stage of last season and it 's not difficult to work out why they are struggling in mid-table			0
a summer move for @entity0 may have seen a much bigger total in @entity5 's ' goals for ' column but instead they will have to do all they can to stop 2014 's top scorer			1
@entity5 have been interested in @entity0 in the past and the striker would surely improve the @entity118 ' goal tally @entity5 have struggled for goals this season without the partnership of @entity110 and @entity36 having dropped goalkeeper @entity134 - only to reinstate the @entity135 following an injury to @entity137 at @entity138 on @entity140 - @entity5 boss @entity106 will be desperate for his leaky defence to tighten up against the @entity142 10 , fully aware of the test that lies ahead for his backline			2
@entity0 will be relishing the opportunity to add to the 20 goals he has netted in the last 12 months ; particularly against a defence struggling to keep goals out			0
it 's his goals which have earned the striker plaudits but those who watch him week in , week out at the @entity151 will tell you there is much more to @entity0 's game than just finding the back of the net			2
built like a giant with tree trunks for legs , @entity0 has boasted a muscular physique since his early playing days - as seen during his time on the field in @entity167 - and uses it to his advantage			0
@entity169 leads the line for @entity1 and provides a huge presence up front for @entity174 's side @entity0 holds off the challenge of @entity177 midfielder @entity176 during @entity1 's @entity140 victory at ease with his back to goal , holding the ball up for his @entity1 team - mates and providing a huge presence as he leads the line , @entity0 - who has created 35 chances this year - would aide any team in the @entity7			1
of course , having developed during eight years in @entity38 , @entity0 is a much improved player to the one that first visited @entity5 as a promising 18 - year - old striker			2
however , now @entity0 is one of the @entity7 's most potent attackers , it would make sense for @entity5 to make another beeline for the one that got away			1
especially if the striker impresses during his latest @entity2 audition .			0
