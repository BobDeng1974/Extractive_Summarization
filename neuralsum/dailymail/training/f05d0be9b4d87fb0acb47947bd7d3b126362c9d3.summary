by @entity0 foreigners travelling to @entity2 to exploit the @entity3 is costing us billions every year the ‘ massive and escalating problem ’ of foreigners travelling to @entity2 to exploit the @entity3 is costing us billions every year , a senior doctor has warned			1
in a dramatic expose of the extent of health tourism , a leading surgeon said the cash - strapped @entity11 is becoming the ‘ world ’s maternity wing ’ as expectant mothers arrive just to give birth			1
thousands of others are flying here for cancer , hiv , kidney and infertility treatment – and then leaving without paying , according to cancer specialist @entity23			1
some are so ill - even semi-conscious - that they have to be wheelchaired onto planes in foreign countries and on arrival at @entity2 airports go straight into @entity3 hospitals			2
many arrive specifically to give birth , then argue that they should not be charged because it counts as emergency care			0
some are committing identity fraud , but the @entity3 is powerless to act			2
and this ‘ serial abuse ’ could be costing taxpayers billions every year , he warned – far above previous estimates			0
in a stinging article , professor @entity23 , consultant surgeon at the @entity39 in @entity40 , cites a string of cases from across the @entity3 to conclude : ‘ it all adds up to clear , widespread abuse of our @entity3 by ineligible patients			1
’ but he warned that the @entity3 may be ‘ addled with too many loopholes ’ to address the problem and could have ‘ reached the @entity49 ’			0
last month @entity50 pledged a crackdown on health tourism , saying he wanted to tighten eligibility to free care and do more to ensure the @entity3 recoups the money it is owed			2
the prime minister faced criticism when he was unable to put a figure on the extent of the abuse , citing old statistics showing it could be up to £ 20million a year			0
in the @entity64 magazine , professor @entity23 welcomed mr @entity50 ’s pledge , but said he had been ‘ overwhelmed ’ by letters informing him of the true scale of the problem since writing a piece in the same magazine three weeks ago highlighting how easily foreigners can abuse the @entity3			1
abuse of the @entity3 : thousands of foreigners fly to the @entity2 for treatment according to cancer specialist professor @entity23 he quoted one from a junior hospital doctor working close to @entity78			1
‘ every single week , i see people who have been flown in from all over the world with a variety of extremely serious health problems , ’ the letter said			0
‘ many of these people had to be wheelchaired on to the plane because they were too unwell to walk on board			0
‘ we often have our @entity88 full of patients without @entity3 numbers who are there for weeks or months with no means or intention to pay , which impacts on our resources			2
’ professor @entity23 said the most ‘ revealing and scandalous ’ reports come from overseas visitor officers , who are employed by hospitals to identify and recover costs from those not entitled to free care			1
‘ i have now been contacted by more than a dozen @entity102 , desperate to be heard , who have given me scores of cases of abuse covering every aspect of @entity3 activity , ’ he said			2
‘ some , fearing reprisal from senior managers , have spoken to me on condition of anonymity			0
crackdown : @entity50 has pledged to tighten eligibility to free care ‘ this abuse may be costing the @entity3 ( and therefore the @entity2 taxpayer ) not millions but billions of pounds every year			1
the mystery for those of us working in the @entity3 is how the @entity120 and 40,000 or so hospital managers have allowed this to happen			0
’ the doctor said maternity health tourism was a ‘ massive and escalating problem ’ , adding : ‘ often the patient refuses to pay , claiming that a childbirth qualifies as emergency care and therefore can not be refused to anyone			0
in this way , the @entity3 can be used as the world ’s maternity wing			1
’ this only adds to the pressure on wards , where birth rates in recent years have consistently proved higher than predicted and a midwife shortage means some have to close their doors because they are at capacity			0
professor @entity23 said there was also evidence of identity fraud , with blood tests taken in hospital revealing the woman has a different blood group to the one in the @entity3 records of the person they claim to be			1
he said renal dialysis was ‘ probably the most costly form of abuse ’ because the treatment needs to take place three times a week and may result in a kidney transplant			0
cancer patients often travel to the @entity2 for treatment which they do not pay for , he said , adding : ‘ the @entity3 does not have the resources for such largesse			1
’ professor @entity23 called on health secretary @entity161 to hold a national audit on the extent of the problem			1
the audit should be ‘ manager - free ’ , he said , ‘ because it is the mandarins and officials who have presided over the genesis and evolution of the current problem ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity120 said the government was determined to crack down on health tourism , adding : ‘ the @entity3 should only be providing care to those entitled to its support , which is why we have announced plans to prevent unfair access and improve the @entity3 ’s ability to charge for the full cost of treatment , where appropriate			2
