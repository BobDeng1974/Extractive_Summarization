@entity1 president @entity0 has called for a rethink on the away goals rule and questioned whether the method for settling knock - out games still makes sense			1
the system - where the team who has scored the most goals away from home wins the tie if the scores are level - has been used since 1965 in @entity16 competition and still applies in the @entity17 and @entity18			0
@entity0 claims the rule favours teams playing away from home in the second leg because those games can go to extra time meaning more time to score an away goal			1
@entity1 president @entity0 has questioned the fairness of the away goals rule in knock - out competitions in his column in the @entity31 magazine , which is being published on friday , @entity0 pointed out the rule was scrapped in the @entity34 play - offs in 2000			1
@entity0 says : ' it is time to rethink the system			0
football has progressed since the 1960s , so the away goals rule may now be questioned			2
does the away goals rule still make sense ? ' the idea dates back to a time when away games were often an adventure , involving journeys that could be long and arduous - and the playing conditions would vary considerably			2
@entity0 , pictured with actor @entity48 , said the rule favours teams who play away from home second ' in reality it favours the club that play away from home in the second leg			2
where the scores are tied , that team has 30 minutes more than their opponent to score a valuable away goal			0
after all , in the first leg there is no extra time			0
' such an imbalance has already been disposed of in various competitions			0
the away goals rule is no longer used in the semi-finals of the promotion play - offs in @entity72 football			1
' @entity0 suggested a modification could be used such as in employed in @entity75 play - offs in the @entity76 and in the @entity77 where away goals only count ' double ' until the end of normal time in the second leg and not in extra time			1
the rule has been used in @entity16 competition since 1965 , it 's used in the @entity87 and @entity17			0

@entity0 has questioned the *validity* of the away goals rule
the @entity1 president says the system is *unfair*
teams playing second leg away from home have the advantage
*possibility* to go to extra time means another half hour to score away goal
*championship* play - off semi finals have *n't* had away goals since 2000
