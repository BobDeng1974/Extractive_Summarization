three major airlines are facing legal action over allegations of poor handling of passengers hit by disruption to flights			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were said to have breached airline policies when it came to consistently offering their customers compensation for disrupted flights and had imposed false deadlines for claims			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) added that @entity16 and @entity7 had also failed to tell passengers about their right for compensation			1
@entity16 , @entity7 and @entity8 have not made changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions , it is claimed all three airlines had also failed to make the changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions , it is claimed			1
the @entity15 has announced it has launched enforcement action against the carriers and will seek a court order unless they comply			2
but a spokeswoman for @entity7 hit back at the claims , calling them ' materially inaccurate '			0
she said the airline was already paying £ 289 compensation per person for disruption caused by technical faults - in line with the @entity40 ruling - even though their average fare is £ 80			0
' airlines are entitled to limit to two years the period in which claims can be made by contractual limitations and these have been upheld by the court on a number of occasions , ' she added			0
' @entity7 strictly abides by court decisions and is acting in accordance with the law , not contrary to it			2
the @entity15 alleged that @entity7 and @entity8 have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults , despite a @entity59 ruling clarifying that airlines must do so ' no enforcement action has been taken			1
the @entity15 is obligated to consult with @entity7 before considering enforcement action			1
given the misapprehensions of the @entity15 , @entity7 expects that following the mandatory consultation process the @entity15 will not wish to take the matter any further			1
' a spokesman for @entity16 added : ' @entity16 ' procedures , relating to the provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , are fully compliant with all the relevant regulations			0
- @entity7 and @entity8 have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults , despite a @entity59 ruling clarifying that airlines must do so			2
- @entity7 and @entity8 are imposing two - year time limits for passengers to take compensation claims to court , despite a @entity59 ruling that passengers should have up to six years to take a claim to court			1
- @entity7 and @entity16 have failed to give satisfactory evidence that they proactively provide passengers with information about their rights during disruption in line with the requirements set out in @entity96 regulation			1
' we have provided a number of documents to the @entity15 in recent months to substantiate this point and we continue to engage with the @entity15 to address their concerns			0
' the move by the @entity15 comes after the authority carried out a six - month review of airline policies in relation to supporting passengers during disruption , including their approaches to paying flight delay compensation and providing information to fliers about their rights			0
@entity8 's spokesman @entity115 said : ' an application for stay had been made regarding a case in the @entity120 courts while the @entity121 is considering a relevant case relating to the extent of airlines ' liability to pay compensation claims in certain cases involving technical faults and defects			0
' after this lawful application for stay was denied by @entity120 courts , @entity8 decided not to appeal this decision and to re-assess the tens of cases where customers claimed compensation after flight disruptions caused by unforeseeable technical faults			0
' the @entity140 @entity15 is well aware that @entity8 is re-assessing these cases and has confirmed to the @entity15 itself , some time ago , that it will apply the @entity140 @entity15 's own list of extraordinary circumstances in the relevant cases			2
' @entity8 further confirms that claims can be raised within two years after the flight disruption , in line with its general conditions of carriage agreed to by customers at the time of booking , an approach which has been upheld by the @entity120 courts			0
' @entity16 denied claims and said their provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , were ' fully compliant with all the relevant regulations ' @entity160 , chief executive of the @entity15 , said : ' airlines are well aware of the support they must provide when there is disruption and passengers have every right to be disappointed that a small number of airlines are not complying with the @entity59 rulings and continue to let people down in this way			1
' since the law was clarified last year , we have been active to ensure airlines are applying consumer law appropriately and i warmly welcome the response of those airlines that have changed their policies as a result of this work			2
' our job is not done until all airlines can demonstrate they are providing care , assistance and compensation as required by law			0
' while we have no power to secure redress for individual consumers , we are determined to stand up for passengers and are taking this action to safeguard their rights , making sure all airlines consistently provide their passengers with the support and compensation they are legally entitled to			0
