vice admiral @entity0 says the @entity1 is overly reliant on civilians to repair its craft , which are then left limping back to port for repairs a serving @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on the state of the @entity1 , claiming it has been reduced to a collection of broken - down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are demoralised and poorly trained			1
in an extremely unusual move for such a high - ranking officer , vice admiral @entity0 blamed government spending cuts for undermining the @entity1 ’s ability to carry out its duties			1
admiral @entity0 complained that : admiral @entity0 , who joined the @entity1 in 1978 , is a nuclear and engineering expert			1
writing in a military journal , he said : ‘ the price of unrelenting operational tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes			0
‘ for example , the lack of operators trained to stream and recover @entity32 towed sonar			1
‘ overall material readiness continues to decline			0
from the submarine perspective , the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by late delivery of @entity40 [ a new model of submarine ] and platform ageing			2
‘ support is increasingly over-reliant on [ civilians ] for repair			2
this philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence			0
’ admiral @entity0 cited the submarine @entity51 , which was due to be retired in 2011 , yet completed a 333 - day deployment – the longest - ever by a @entity54 nuclear vessel – over 2012 - 13			1
@entity55 , a £ 1bn destroyer , was forced to abandon exercises in february after suffering a loss of power a number of vessels have also had to be towed back to @entity54 after malfunctioning at sea			1
in february , @entity55 , a destroyer , was forced to abandon exercises and seek emergency repairs after losing power			0
the 8,000 - ton ship , which cost more than £ 1 billion to build , suffered a similar problem off @entity68 in 2012 , as did her sister ship @entity69 in 2009 and 2012			0
engineers were unable to fix the faults and the ships had to limp to the nearest port			2
in his report , published in the naval engineer , admiral @entity0 also criticised a ‘ churn and outflow ’ of staff , which was coupled with ‘ reduced training investment and increasing transfer of engineering responsibility to [ civilians ]			1
’ the @entity84 said : ‘ the admiral is merely pointing out the obvious facts given the shortage of engineers across the maritime industry			0
' it is a challenge to recruit and retain these skilled personnel			0
we are offering incentives and excellent training			0

vice admiral @entity0 has attacked government spending cuts
claims they have left @entity1 with broken - down ships and demoralised crews
added that force is overly - reliant on civilians to repair ageing vessels
on a recent *mission* , there were not enough *sailors* able to use the @entity32 ’s towed sonar array – needed to track @entity111 ’s nuclear submarines .
ships grind to a halt at sea because no time is set aside for basic maintenance before they sail – and when problems arise , crews are *incapable* of finding or fixing the faults .
officers do *n’t* receive necessary training and rely on civilian *consultants* to solve technical problems , causing a drain on skills .
*budget* *constraints* mean the @entity1 buys second - rate *equipment* .
