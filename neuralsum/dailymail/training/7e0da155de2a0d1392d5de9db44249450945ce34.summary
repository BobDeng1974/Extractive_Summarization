by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 20:45 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 05:45 est , 19 march 2014 @entity4 gov. @entity3 took on a persistent health care activist tuesday during a regularly scheduled town hall event in @entity7 , @entity4 , fending off accusations for nearly four minutes			1
@entity9 , a health policy advocate with the liberal group @entity11 , blasted @entity3 during the question - and - answer event , the 114th such town hall he has held since taking office			2
she blamed him for meeting her fellow activists with ' silence ' when they try to help poor @entity19 access @entity21 benefits			0
' let me ask you this : when i expanded the @entity21 program , is that silence ? ' retorted an annoyed @entity3			1
they were later identified as activists with @entity45 , a group supported by public - sector labor unions			0
the @entity4 chief executive was among a small group of @entity50 governors who opted to take federal dollars provided by the @entity53 law to raise the maximum income that qualifies for free @entity21 insurance coverage			1
the billions of dollars are helping lower - income @entity37 access health care now , but in future years the financial burden will shift to the states – a reality behind most @entity50 governors ' decisions to turn down the money from @entity64			1
@entity3 has forged a middle path , taking the medicaid dollars but refusing to spend still more state taxpayer money to expand @entity21 access even further , as many @entity70 governors have done			1
he told @entity72 on tuesday that his state is spending more federal and state dollars on @entity21 that it was when he became governor			1
' we 've expanded @entity21 , ' he countered			0
' we 're the second most generous @entity21 program in the @entity1			2
' ' you 're simply wrong , ' @entity3 blasted , in the tense exchange broadcast on @entity81			1
and he wo n't , he said , spend more on a ' failed federal program			1
' @entity3 stayed silent as police removed his union - backed hecklers , including the woman at far left above			2
@entity3 has held 114 @entity38 constituent meetings since becoming governor , earning a reputation for responsiveness despite occasionally being raked over the coals on subjects like @entity43 relief and the so - called ' @entity96 ' scandal ' you believe @entity53 works , and i do not , ' @entity3 said , becoming more agitated by the minute but earning sustained applause from his audience			1
that 's just the way it goes			0
' ' we need to do other things , ' the woman insisted , sounding more like a heckler than a questioner and insisting @entity21 is ' not a cure - all			2
' she was likely referring to the @entity4 government 's decision to opt out of creating its own @entity53 insurance exchange , forcing residents to use the federal government 's problem - plagued healthcare.gov website instead			1
@entity3 was also interrupted by more than a dozen union - backed activists from the @entity45 organization			2
they sounded more like @entity123 devotees , shouting ' mic check ! ' before chanting slogans in a call - and - response fashion			0
' we are here to demand that you stop your corrupt uses of @entity43 money , ' they yelled			0
' there are still families without homes who have received no aid			0
' police ushered them out as the mostly appreciative crowd applauded			0
@entity3 , who had kept mum while the protesteres yelled , said , ' well , congratulations			0
you have now seen the latest gift given to you by the public sector unions in the state of @entity4			0

the @entity4 governor fended off *rhetorical* body blows for nearly four minutes as a @entity32 activist *jabbed* him about @entity21 access
@entity3 , he *reminded* her , has *increased* @entity21 spending and accepted federal dollars – *unlike* more @entity50 governors – to cover more *people*
' you 're simply wrong , ' @entity3 blasted , while insisting he wo n't spend even more money on @entity53 , which he called a ' failed federal program '
more than a dozen other hecklers interrupted him tuesday , *complaining* @entity123 - style about relief efforts following @entity169 storm @entity43
