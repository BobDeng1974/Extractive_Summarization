by @entity0 , education correspondent published : 21:04 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 05:56 est , 5 march 2014 @entity2 has overtaken @entity3 as the most popular author in @entity6 schools - and @entity7 is fast catching up			1
@entity2 , who penned the @entity9 series , pipped @entity3 to first place in a top 10 list of the most - read children ’s authors			1
@entity7 , meanwhile , moved up the chart faster than any author , eclipsing @entity16 and @entity17 to take fifth spot			2
@entity19 : @entity2 ( left ) has overtaken @entity3 ( pictured ) as the most popular author in @entity6 schools notable works : @entity2 penned the @entity9 book ( left ) , while @entity3 was the author of @entity22 ( right ) the comic , who created the @entity25 tv series , has written seven novels for children , with titles such as mr @entity29 and @entity30			1
the trends emerged in the latest in a series of annual studies analysing the reading habits of tens of thousands of @entity6 schoolchildren			2
it found that @entity2 , whose series features a young boy ’s struggles with school and family , has pulled ahead of @entity3 for the first time despite publishing a relatively small number of books			1
in an ‘ extremely creditable performance ’ , @entity7 was a new entrant in the top 10 , behind @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity48 , who wrote the @entity50 series , and @entity51 , with the @entity53 books			1
success : @entity7 moved up the top 10 list of the most - read children 's authors faster than any author products : the comic has written seven novels for children , including @entity29 ( right ) and @entity62 ( left ) the sixth annual ‘ what kids are @entity66 ’ report , which covered 426,000 children in more than 2,000 schools , also found that children ’s reading habits deterioriate sharply when they reach secondary school			1
up until the age of ten , the difficulty of books that children choose and the amount they read shows a steady increase			0
popular : @entity51 , who wrote the @entity53 books ( pictured ) , also placed in the top 10 list but interest then dwindles , with many older children - including academic high - fliers - choosing books that are too easy for them , including books about football and star players			1
‘ there is a marked downturn in the difficulty of books at secondary transfer and this does not necessarily reflect a lack of ability to read more difficult texts , ’ said the report ’s author , professor @entity87 , of @entity89			0
‘ it seems that secondary teachers and librarians are not encouraging students to attack more difficult books to a sufficient degree			0
’ he added : ‘ non-fiction needs to be read more widely but students need better guidance on reading at a level of difficulty which challenges them , as the difficulty of much non-fiction read in the later years was extremely low			0
’ among teenagers , books about sport and football - such as biographies of @entity118 and @entity119 - dominate the non-fiction charts			0
the titles ‘ are appealing to older boys ’ but may not be challenging enough for their ability levels			0
boys and girls were found to choose books of equal difficulty , reversing a trend seen last year where girls were picking out more challenging books			0
the study analysed data from @entity136 software , which assesses which books are being read in schools and tests children ’s understanding of them through a series of quizzes			2
@entity143 , the software firm ’s professional services director , said : ‘ the difficulty of books read and the accuracy with which they are understood is in fact on the rise , but there is still a significant problem with lack of challenge			0
