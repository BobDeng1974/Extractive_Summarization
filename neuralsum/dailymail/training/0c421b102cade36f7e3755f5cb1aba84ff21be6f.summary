@entity3 , 43 , and his partner @entity15 , were easily beating regular opponents @entity16 and @entity18 during a game in early march last year			1
mr @entity3 and mr @entity15 had both outdriven the other pair on the 14th hole of the @entity23 golf course in @entity24 , @entity25			1
each landed the ball nicely on the fairway , leaving mr @entity16 and mr @entity18 at the edge of the woods trying to clear a bunker			2
but while mr @entity3 was waiting for mr @entity15 to hit his second shot , he noticed a shallow , bathtub - size depression in the grass of the fairway			1
it was out of place on the well - kept course , and looked as if it would be tricky to play out of			2
he walked over and stepped into the depression - and promptly vanished			1
acidic rainwater thousands of years ago had started dissolving the limestone bedrock 30 feet under the topsoil			0
eventually , an underground pit had formed , topped by a clay arch covered with only a flimsy layer of turf			0
mr @entity16 shined a small torch out of his pocket and pointed it down the hole			1
all he could see of @entity3 was a bit of white t - shirt			1
he shouted down to him : ' are you all right , @entity3 ? ' ' no , i ’m not			1
' the stricken golfer replied according to a feature in the february issue of @entity59			0
@entity15 , @entity18 , and @entity16 call to @entity3 in the sinkhole to make the situation worse , mr @entity3 is claustrophobic so his friends enlarged the hole overhead , letting in more daylight			1
the sinkhole was about 12 feet across and narrower at the top and he had landed on mud and other debris that had fallen with him			2
one of the course ’s owners , @entity71 , and his son @entity72 arrived with a 12 - foot ladder and a rope , but as it was too short , they resorted to putting it on the mud pile			1
the injured man then had to slide across the mud pile and tried to climb up the ladder but he was too hurt to manage it			0
mr @entity16 then went down to fetch his friend			2

@entity126 : a sinkhole damaged this major road in the busy city of @entity126 a sinkhole damaged an on - ramp to @entity132 in @entity126 in february 1998			2
the hole was caused by a drainage pipe which burst due to heavy rains attributed to @entity137 weather patterns and was approximately 800 - feet long , 40 - feet wide , and 70 - feet deep			2
when he descended , mr @entity16 climbed down the ladder and shone his torch around the cave			0
at its bottom was a crack four feet long and four inches wide			0
through his medical training , he realised mr @entity3 was seriously injured and made a sling from his jacket for his friend 's arm			1
his shoulder was dislocated and the pair were now fighting against the coninuing collapse of the hole they were in			2
' i survived a sinkhole ' in @entity59 the crack on the floor below them was widening and the friends knew they had to get out of the hole quickly			1
an ambulance was waiting at the clubhouse as they pulled up in the golf cart			0
in hospital , mr @entity3 learned that his shoulder was separated and fractured in two places			1
his biceps tendon was also torn			0
the @entity168 blocked off the sinkhole with fencing and , using heavy equipment , excavated the area			0
what lay on the other side of the crack on the bottom of the hole was another chamber			0
