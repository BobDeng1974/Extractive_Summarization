two men in a helicopter have saved a birthing southern right whale in @entity3 from an imminent shark attack - and luckily , one of the men on board was able to photograph the extraordinary sequence of events on wednesday , tourism operator @entity10 was flying on a helicopter with his friend , helicopter pilot @entity13 , taking aerial photographs off the coast of @entity16 , south of the @entity17 in @entity3			1
from a great height , they first spotted the calving whale - and almost immediately after , a predator shark heading straight for the helpless mammal in the shallows			1
' as we flew by the @entity27 cliffs about 1500 feet in the air , @entity29 and i spotted something			0
it looked like a really big fish from that high up ! on closer inspection , we realised that it was a @entity36 giving birth , ' mr @entity10 told @entity38			1
the friends soon realised that they had found a southern right whale giving birth to her calf			1
@entity13 dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from a calving southern right whale off the coast of @entity16 ' we get more than 30,000 whales migrating along the west coast at peak season every year			1
we see whales all the time , you 'll see at least one a day			0
' so you get to understand whale behaviour			2
i 'd seen a whale calving quite recently so i knew what was happening when i saw the whale on wednesday			2
you could tell that she was giving birth because they come close to shore and have certain @entity68 come close to the water 's surface and arch their backs			2
' it was then that the pair spotted the bronze whaler shark and with only seconds to react , took it upon themselves to prevent the inevitable tragedy			2
whilst watching the pregnant whale in the shallows , mr @entity13 spotted a four - metre shark ( pictured ) in the distance , heading straight for the whale ' we could see a shark moving down the beach			2
you could tell , it was coming quite quickly			0
it was massive , about four metres long and heading straight for the southern right			2
' we only had seconds to think about it			0
there was no time , but we had to do something			0
' ' i mean , i 'm all for letting nature do it 's thing			2
we would n't normally interfere at all but it would be too sad if we left the shark to attack the brand new calf right after the poor mother gave birth			0
' mr @entity13 dropped the helicopter down and closed in on the shark , to chase it away from the vulnerable calving whale and towards deeper waters			1
throughout the whole ordeal , mr @entity10 kept taking photographs - a courageous task considering his chopper door was open the entire time			1
' it was pretty cool to see what the helicopter could do			0
we turned sideways at one point when we were directly over the shark			0
i 'd left my door open while i took photographs to get a better shot , so i was pretty nervous when i was hanging sideways directly over the shark with nothing between us ! ' ' it all happened so quickly but i just tried to keep clicking to get some photos			0
the shark high - tailed it out of there very quickly , he got a pretty big fright , i think , ' mr @entity10 said			1
@entity13 dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from the calving southern right whale			1
@entity10 tried to take photographs - a courageous task , with his door open and the helicopter on its side while they hovered over the shark ' we could n't believe what was happening , things just kept popping up before our eyes , it did n't seem real ! ' said mr @entity10			1
' we were near @entity146 beach and landed on the sand to give the whale plenty of space , because we did n't want to disturb her			0
we did n't want to stress the poor whale while she gave birth , but we were keeping an eye on her to make sure she was okay			0
mr @entity13 landed the helicopter on the sand once the shark had been herded away from the whale and out to deeper water			1
from a safe distance , the men both watched the whale in the shallows ' a pod of about 20 dolphins arrived to circle the birthing whale , it was really quite amazing - like the call of nature			1
we decided to fly off before the whale gave birth because we knew she was safe			0
the dolphins made a ring around her to protect her			2
' we had a laugh and said well , we can leave because we know the dolphins are here to manage the maternity ward for the night ! ' said mr @entity10			1
' it was just amazing - nature at work			0
it 's something you never forget			0
' ' it was like nature 's call ! ' mr @entity188 and mr @entity13 were amazed when a pod of around 20 dolphins arrived , encircling the expectant mother whale to protect her			1
the men left , assured the whale was safe with the dolphins there to ' manage the maternity ward			1
