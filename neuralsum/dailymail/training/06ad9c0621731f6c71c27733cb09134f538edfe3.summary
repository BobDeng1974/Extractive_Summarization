a @entity2 soldier awarded a posthumous @entity3 died in vain because of an order to prevent damage to @entity8 mud huts , an inquest will be told this summer			1
colleagues of lance corporal @entity10 – who won the @entity2 ’s highest gallantry medal – are expected to tell a coroner they were denied powerful weapons to take on the @entity8 due to fears mortars and rockets could damage buildings			1
soldiers from the @entity18 will claim @entity10 died because he was forced to crawl to within a few feet of an enemy sniper in a mud hut while clutching a grenade , rather than firing from a safer distance			1
inquest : lance corporal @entity10 's ( pictured ) colleagues will claim the regulations to protect infrastructure in the @entity28 led to his death last night his father @entity30 accused top brass of sacrificing his son ’s life to protect the building , saying his pride in his son ’s @entity3 was now coupled with anger over the way in which he had died			1
‘ we can build more mud huts but nobody can bring back my son			0
this is hard to stomach , ’ he said			0
just weeks before @entity46 died in june last year , new tactics were introduced by the multi-national forces in @entity48 that prevented use of heavy weapons in all but the most exceptional circumstances			0
the change – in response to a request from president @entity55 to protect local infrastructure – meant @entity2 patrols no longer carried mortars and shoulder - held rocket launchers on routine operations , forcing them to engage any targets at close range			1
@entity65 would still be alive if they had been able to use the weapons that were restricted just a month earlier , his comrades will say			0
the revelation follows last week ’s ruling by the @entity69 that any decision to deny troops access to adequate weaponry could constitute a negligent decision and therefore a breach of their human rights – potentially opening the floodgates for hundreds of damages claims from bereaved families			0
outrage : lance corporal @entity10 's family have said they are angry and accused top brass of sacrificing his life to protect the building			1
( l to @entity86 ) father @entity30 , mother @entity87 and brother @entity88 yesterday , defence secretary @entity89 warned that the ruling could prevent @entity2 soldiers carrying out vital missions because their commanders will be frightened about being sued if their troops are badly wounded or killed			0
he said : ‘ we ca n’t have commanders living in fear of how lawyers back in @entity99 might interpret their battlefield decisions that are vital to protecting our national security			0
’ @entity46 was awarded a @entity3 after taking on a @entity8 sniper team in @entity104 , @entity28 province , on june 13 last year			1
he was killed while getting into position to throw a grenade through the window of the mud hut occupied by a @entity8 sniper			1
@entity10 ’s father @entity30 , 45 , from the @entity112 , @entity113 , added : ‘ @entity10 was put in even graver danger by the lack of basic weapons			2
award : @entity118 was given a posthumous @entity3			1
it is the @entity2 's highest gallantry medal @entity10 or one of his colleagues could have fired a mortar or a rocket - launcher from a longer range and in all likelihood he would be here today			1
’ platoon commander captain @entity125 will be called to the inquest at @entity128 magistrates ’ court on august 1			2
grenadiers who fought a close - range gun battle in the mud hut are also expected to give evidence			0
a @entity135 source said : ‘ while captain @entity125 will support the @entity139 ’s version of events , the junior soldiers will express their frustration about having to fight the @entity8 with effectively one arm tied behind their backs that summer			0
‘ @entity10 would still be alive if we ’d used the same weaponry we used on the 09/10 tour			2
’ a legal expert told @entity149 that the failure to provide adequate weaponry could provide grounds for a future negligence claim by the @entity154 against the @entity155 @entity156 of @entity157 said : ‘ if weapons were denied to soldiers as a result of a decision taken sufficiently away from the battlefield ... it may be possible to establish liability against the @entity155 under negligence or the @entity166			2
‘ the @entity155 does not have carte blanche to fail to equip troops			0
’ an @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ our thoughts remain with the family of @entity10			2
@entity2 forces continue to operate under established @entity174 which give them the right to defend themselves and to call in the fire support they need in any situation			0
