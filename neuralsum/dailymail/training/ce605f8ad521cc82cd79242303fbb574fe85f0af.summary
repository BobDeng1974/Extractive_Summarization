a suicide bomber has killed at least six people , and wounded ten , after blowing himself up in a busy market in the @entity4 city of @entity5			1
the brutal attack bears all the hallmarks of @entity9 group @entity8 , although no one has yet claimed responsibility for it			1
they have killed thousands of @entity4 in gun and bomb assaults in the last five years - particularly in the hard to reach areas in the north - east of the country where @entity5 lies			1
@entity19 , a spokesman for the @entity20 for @entity5 , said : ' our workers have evacuated six bodies and 10 injured , and we believe there could more bodies because the market is usually populated			1
the pictures , released by @entity52 , showed how over 2,000 people were brutally murdered - and 3,7000 buildings were razed to the ground by the extremist group			1
in the pictures taken beforehand , areas in red showed buildings and trees in the densely packed towns in the north of the country			2
but in the pictures taken after the massacre , grey areas reveal how the the town has been decimated by the assault			2
the destruction shown in these images matches the horrific stories from eyewitnesses revealing how @entity8 militants shot hundreds of civilians in cold blood			1
one witness described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately , killing even small children and a woman who was in labour			0
he added : ' half of the baby boy is out and she died like this			0
' @entity86 , a 25 - year - old truck driver , survived the relentless attack in @entity33 but he still does n't know if his wife and daughter are safe			0
he said : ' as we were running for our lives , we came across many corpses , both men and women , and even children			0
' some had gunshot wounds in the head and some had their legs bound and hands tied behind their backs			0
' before : infra - red images show the densely populated village of @entity33 on january 2 - before the attack after : this image taken on january 7 , following @entity8 's assault , shows the village transformed by death and destruction ineffective : @entity4 's president @entity110 ( pictured ) has been accused of failing to combat increasingly deadly attacks from @entity8 next week , @entity113 leaders will approach the @entity114 to create a multi-national alliance to fight back against @entity8 insurgents			1
such a force would represent the most robust international response yet to the militants who have killed thousands in @entity4 alone - and also crossed the border to attack innocent people in @entity122 and @entity123			2
@entity8 is seen as the most serious security threat to @entity4 - @entity126 's most populous country and its biggest energy producer			2
@entity129 's president , @entity128 , has said : ' terrorism is like a cancer and if we do n't deal with it it will keep going			0
speaking as the chair of the @entity113 regional alliance @entity135 - which has been accused of failing to combat @entity8 - he added : ' @entity4 is taking military action and @entity123 is fighting @entity8 , but i think we are increasingly getting to the point where probably a regional or a multinational force is coming into consideration			1
' ' it threatens everybody in the sub region			0
when it comes to terrorism nobody is too far or too near			0
