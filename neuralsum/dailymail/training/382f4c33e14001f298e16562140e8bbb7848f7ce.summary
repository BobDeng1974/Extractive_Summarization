@entity2 's new @entity1 video may be filled with shots of beautiful @entity5 scenery , but it was a mere five seconds that got everyone talking			1
the minute - long film was released to announce a new push by the administration to protect a large portion of @entity5 's @entity12 for preservation , effectively protecting it from oil drilling			1
but it was n't only the video 's message that riled @entity18 - it was the fact the clip featured @entity2 explaining the new initiative while en route to @entity21 on @entity22 , an aircraft with a fuel capacity of 53,611 gallons			1
' it supports caribou and polar bears , all manner of marine life , countless species of birds and fish , and for centuries it supported many @entity52 communities			0
but it 's very fragile			0
' that 's why i 'm very proud my @entity56 has put forth a comprehensive plan to make sure we 're protecting the refuge and designating new areas , including @entity61 , for preservation			0
' and i 'm going to be calling on @entity63 to make sure they take it one step further , designating it as a wilderness so we can make sure this amazing wonder is preserved for future generations			2
' the plan , which would protect 12 million acres of the @entity30 from oil drilling , has angered republicans in the state and @entity76 alike			1
@entity5 @entity78 sen. @entity78 , the new chairman of the @entity79 , said the move ' effectively declared war on @entity5 ' , @entity77 reported			1
' it supports caribou and polar bears , all manner of marine life , countless species of birds and fish , and for centuries it supported many @entity52 communities			0
but it 's very fragile , ' he said @entity2 then announces the @entity56 has ' put forth a comprehensive plan to make sure we 're protecting the refuge and designating new areas , including @entity61 , for preservation ' ' what 's coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us , our children and our grandchildren to thrive , ' she later said in a joint statement with other legislators in the state			2
' it 's clear this administration does not care about us , and sees us as nothing but a territory			0
we will fight back with every resource at our disposal			0
' @entity5 @entity115 sen. @entity115 called the move ' just one more example of president @entity2 thumbing his nose at the citizens of a sovereign state ' and said it ' will put @entity5 and @entity122 ’s energy security in serious jeopardy			1
' just days before @entity2 released his video , sen. @entity78 introduced a bill to permit oil production in the refuge			1
the @entity1 has defended the proposed expansion in a blog post written by presidential counselor @entity131 and @entity132 , head of the @entity133			0
' the @entity2 administration believes that oil and natural gas resources can be developed safely			0
unfortunately , accidents and spills can still happen , ' they write			0
' the @entity61 of the @entity12 , one of the few remaining places in the country as pristine today as it was when the oldest @entity52 communities first set eyes on it , is too precious to put at risk			0
' by designating the area as wilderness , @entity63 could preserve the @entity61 in perpetuity — ensuring that this wild , free , beautiful , and bountiful place remains in trust for @entity52 and for all @entity122			0
' the plan , which would protect 12 million acres of the @entity30 from oil drilling , has angered @entity18 in the state and @entity76 alike @entity5 @entity78 sen. @entity78 , the new chairman of the @entity79 , said the move ' effectively declared war on @entity5 ' environmental groups likewise heralded the move , which would protect a site that is vital for @entity5 's wildlife			1
' this wilderness recommendation has been a long time coming for the place where life begins for the porcupine caribou herd and for many of @entity122 's polar bears , ' @entity162 director @entity161 said			0
@entity169 , president of @entity170 , said in a released statement : ' some places are simply too special to drill , and we are thrilled that a federal agency has acknowledged that the refuge merits wilderness protection			1
' democrats and @entity18 have debated oil drilling in the region , which is currently off - limits and is estimated to hold 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil , since the 1970s			1
@entity63 has tried and failed repeatedly to get legislation to open up the 1.5 million - acre coastal plain to drilling in the past			1
it came closest in 1995 , when president @entity187 vetoed it			0
@entity2 would n't be any more receptive if @entity63 passed legislation again and his wilderness designation will require @entity63 ' approval too			2
and @entity18 in @entity63 , already critical of the administration on its energy policies on federal lands , are just as unlikely to give @entity2 what he wants			2
but the president 's new initiative is just the beginning of a series of decisions that the @entity56 could make this week concerning the state 's oil and gas production , the @entity197 reports			2
the department will also consider whether to impose additional limits on oil and gas production in parts of the @entity5 , as well as the @entity209			2
but environmental groups heralded the move and said ' some places are simply too special to drill ' @entity63 has tried and failed repeatedly to get legislation to open up the 1.5 million - acre coastal plain , which is estimated to hold 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil , to drilling in the past			1
