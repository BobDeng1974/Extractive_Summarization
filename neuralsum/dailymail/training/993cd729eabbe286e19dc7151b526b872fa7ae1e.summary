by @entity0 a mother and father , one of whom inflicted ' extremely distressing ' injuries on their newborn baby , have walked free from court , because it can not be proved which of them was responsible			1
either @entity10 or @entity11 , both 27 , left their son with a fractured skull , fractured ribs and other disturbing injuries when he was just three weeks old			1
the two , both from @entity18 , @entity19 , admitted a cruelty charge on the basis of not getting earlier medical treatment for one of the injuries			1
either @entity11 or @entity10 , both 27 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , inflicted horrific injuries on their three - week old child - but neither can be sentenced for the crime because prosecutors can not be sure which one is responsible but @entity19 @entity30 heard it could not be proved which one inflicted the injuries - and he could not sentence either parent for the injuries , purely on the basis that someone ' ought to pay '			1
sentencing the pair , judge @entity38 said he hoped the perpetrator felt ' shame and regret ' which was ' deeply felt and long term '			1
for the cruelty charge , he sentenced them both to a four - month jail term , suspended for 18 months , but said it would not be in the ' public interest ' to send them to jail			1
the court heard the baby was found with a catalogue of injuries on march 21 by medics last year			2
the little boy had a tear to the flesh in his mouth and skull and rib fractures , possibly caused when he was squeezed and or dropped			2
the judge said : ' the photographs of the injuries suffered by the child and the description of the non-accidental injuries are extremely distressing and would be extremely distressing to anyone			2
' neither of you are to be sentenced for causing or inflicting any injury nor allowing any injury to occur			0
' the perpetrator knows who he or she is and i hope that shame and regret in that person , whoever that person is , is deeply felt and long term			1
judge @entity38 at @entity82 , pictured , said he could not sentence either parent for the injuries purely on the basis that someone ' ought to pay ' ' i can not sentence either of you on the basis someone ought to pay for those terrible , non-accidental injuries			1
' the judge made it clear that one of the pair was responsible for the injuries to the boy			1
he said : ' both of you are the parents of the boy , who at three weeks of age had sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of you			2
' he suffered serious physical harm while in the care of the pair of you			0
the prosecution can not say which of you two inflicted any injuries or even that many of the injuries would have been evident to the non-perpetrator parent			0
' whatever people â€™s views about the injuries suffered are concerned , which are clearly extremely unpleasant , you are to be sentenced only for failure to seek medical attention at an appropriate time in respect of a single injury , without knowledge of how the injury occurred			0
' ' the perpetrator knows who he or she is and i hope that shame and regret in that person , whoever that person is , is deeply felt and long term ' judge @entity38 the judge said the prison sentences could be suspended because there was ' absolutely no public interest ' in sending either defendant to custody for a short time			1
judge @entity38 added : ' the time you actually served would be extremely short and no doubt would be extremely difficult for both of you , in the light of the type of offences for which you fall to be sentenced			0
' the judge said that at the forefront of his mind while passing sentence was the ' burden and standard of proof ' required in criminal cases			0
during the case , prosecutor @entity158 told the court : ' he was three weeks of age and had , by that stage , sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of these two defendants			0
' he suffered serious physical harm while in the care of his parents between the three week period between birth and admission to hospital on march 21 last year			0
' @entity173 , for @entity10 , said : ' he has shown remorse			2
' @entity175 , for @entity11 , said : ' she has been devastated by the proceedings			0
just hearing the word cruelty put her in floods of tears			0

@entity10 or @entity11 left their son with ' distressing injuries '
medics found the three - week old boy had fractured skull and fractured ribs
couple from @entity19 admitted cruelty for not seeking earlier treatment
pair , both 27 , given a four - month suspended jail term for that crime
but judge could not convict for injuries on basis someone ' ought to pay '
said he hoped perpetrator would have ' deeply felt and long term shame '
