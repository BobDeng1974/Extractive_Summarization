by @entity0 last updated at 1:25 pm on 11th november 2011 @entity2 chief @entity1 only found out his daughter ’s wedding had cost him more than £ 12million after the big day – because his ex-wife settled the bill and did n’t tell him			1

@entity1 ’s youngest daughter @entity13 , 22 , married businessman @entity14 in august at a medieval castle in the @entity17 town of @entity18			0
the big day : @entity14 is pictured in a @entity19 with her father - who only found out how much the wedding had cost after it took place happy couple : @entity13 with her husband @entity14			2
the pair married in august the lavish celebration included stunning fireworks displays , acrobats performing beneath hot air balloons , £ 4,000 bottles of @entity35 claret and a private show by chart - topping band @entity37			0

accompanying them was the 20 - member @entity45 , described as ‘ one of the greatest choirs in the world ’			0
more than 250 @entity50 attended and they were kept cool in air - conditioned flower - filled canopies in the castle grounds			0
giving evidence for a second day at the fraud trial of a @entity11 banker , @entity1 told the court : ‘ let me tell you something			1
when my youngest daughter said she was getting married i thought as father of the bride i should pay for the wedding			0
venue : the couple married at this medieval castle in the @entity17 town of @entity18 and were treated to a a fireworks display and flying acrobats secret payments : @entity1 admitted his lawyer in @entity71 acted as ' moneyman ' when he paid £ 27million in blackmail cash to banker @entity74 ‘ when it was suggested how much they would be spending on drinks i thought it was absurd			1
so i managed to upset my daughter and my wife			2
‘ only later did i learn that it cost in excess of £ 12million which i did not find out about until later , paid by my wife , and i did not find out from her			2
’ happier times : @entity1 and ex-wife @entity84 , whose trust half of the cash came from in another startling revelation , the @entity88 court also heard the 81 - year - old motor racing tycoon confess to having a ‘ girlfriend ’ during his 24 - year marriage to wife @entity84			1
in court he constantly referred to @entity84 , 53 , as his wife , despite their divorce in 2009			1
he said the banker , @entity74 , became a ‘ drinking pal ’ of @entity84 and told how they once met in a mobile home at a race meeting where @entity84 tried to extract information about her husband ’s girlfriends			1
‘ were there girlfriends then ? ’ asked the prosecutor			0
‘ well , one girlfriend , ’ replied @entity1 before the questioning moved on			0
the @entity2 boss is the star witness in the case against @entity74 , who is accused of corruption and tax evasion and who @entity1 says blackmailed him out of £ 27million in 2006			1
the tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission that he paid out the vast sum puts him at the centre of the corruption case			2
prosecutors refused to believe that the tycoon had never discussed the ‘ shakedown ’ payment with his then wife , and @entity1 used the story about the wedding bill to illustrate how he and @entity84 kept business and personal spending separate			1
‘ i never brought my business problems home to my wife , ’ he said			2

when he spurned his offers , @entity1 claimed @entity74 began making noises about going to the @entity160			0
‘ he would have landed me with a lengthy investigation , massive legal costs and i did n’t need it and so i paid to get rid of the problem , ’ he said			0
