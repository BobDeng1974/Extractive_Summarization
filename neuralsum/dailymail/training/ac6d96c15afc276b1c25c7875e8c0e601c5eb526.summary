electronic cigarettes can help smokers kick the habit boosting quitting rates by 60 per cent compared with nicotine patches , gum or relying on will power alone , new research has found			1
the findings , published today , follow a survey of 5,863 smokers in @entity10 who attempted to stop smoking without aid of prescription medication or professional support			1
of those using e-cigarettes , a fifth reported having quit ' real ' cigarettes at the time the study was carried out			1
the research , published in the journal @entity22 , suggests that e-cigarettes could play a positive role in reducing smoking rates , say experts			2
a survey carried out by a team at the @entity29 found a fifth reported having ' quit ' real cigarettes after using the electronic alternative study leader professor @entity31 , from @entity32 , said : ' e-cigarettes could substantially improve public health because of their widespread appeal and the huge health gains associated with stopping smoking			1
' however , we should also recognise that the strongest evidence remains for use of the @entity42 stop - smoking services			2
' these almost triple a smoker ’s odds of successfully quitting compared with going it alone or relying on over-the - counter products			0
' the same team , chiefly funded by @entity48 , also found that most e-cigarette use involved first - generation ‘ cigalike ’ products rather than newer devices that use refillable cartridges and a wider choice of nicotine concentrations and flavours			0
co-author dr @entity56 , also from @entity32 , said : ' we will continue to monitor success rates in people using e-cigarettes to stop smoking to see whether there are improvements as the devices become more advanced			0
' the study found the e-cigarettes are more effective in helping someone kick the habit than nicotine patches and gum prof @entity31 acknowledged that some quitters may want to keep using e-cigarettes indefinitely , and it was not clear whether or not this carried long - term health risks			1
but he added : ' from what is known about the contents of the vapour these will be much less than from smoking			0
' some public health experts have expressed concern that widespread use of e-cigarettes could " re-normalise " smoking			1
' however , we are tracking this very closely and see no evidence of it			0
' smoking rates in @entity10 are declining , quitting rates are increasing and regular e-cigarette use among never smokers is negligible			2
' @entity92 , @entity48 ’s head of tobacco policy , said : ' smoking is the largest preventable cause of cancer and accounts for more than one in four cancer deaths in the @entity99 - so helping smokers to stop is a vital contribution to the health of the @entity99			0
' e-cigarettes may have a role in helping people to quit smoking but while the rapid rise in their popularity suggests a real opportunity , the evidence for their effectiveness is so far limited			1
' @entity48 is funding much - needed research into e-cigarette use to help inform policy development and individuals ’ choices , and research such as this is helping to paint a clearer picture			0
' e-cigarettes are battery - powered devices marketed as a way of helping people quit smoking electronic cigarettes are battery - powered devices which simulates smoking			1
the design was patented in 1963 , and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution			0
some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings , will others release a flavoured nicotine - free vapour			0
they are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people			2
the devices are largely designed to look like cigarette and are marketed as a method of helping people quit the habit			1
but experts have widely debated the benefits of e-cigarettes			0
a recent study by scientists at the @entity152 's @entity153 in @entity154 has shown teenagers who use the battery powered devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and less likely to quit smoking , the research showed			2
as the popularity of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - increases , scientists have found that ‘ the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them , but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth ’			1
' despite claims that e-cigarettes are helping people quit smoking , we found that e-cigarettes were associated with more , not less , cigarette smoking among adolescents , ’ said lead author of the study @entity178			1
she added : ‘ e-cigarettes are likely to be gateway devices for nicotine addiction among youth , opening up a whole new market for tobacco			0
’ a study of nearly 40,000 youngsters in the @entity187 found that e-cigarette use among school students doubled between 2011 and 2012 , from 3.1 per cent to 6.5 per cent .			0

@entity195 reported having quit ' real ' cigarettes at the time of the study
found to be 60 *%* more effective than nicotine patches or gum
professor @entity31 at the @entity29 said ' cigalikes ' could ' substantially improve ' public health because of their widespread appeal
