by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 10:50 est , 12 november 2013 a fresh property bubble could be inflating as the government 's help to buy scheme boosts demand and mortgage lending reaches pre-crash levels , experts have warned			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) today said the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11 - year high , and warned urgent action was needed to stop demand outstripping the supply of homes for sale			1
meanwhile the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) reported ' renewed strength ' in the market , with home loans worth £ 26.1bn handed out in the third quarter of this year - the highest quarterly figure since winter 2007			1
on the rise , again : figures from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) out today show the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11 - year high and property website @entity28 said that sellers were becoming more confident about sticking to their asking prices , with a drop in the percentage of vendors dropping their original prices			1
the latest @entity9 @entity37 survey found that sales volumes are at their highest levels in more than five and a half years as more people flood into the property market			1
nearly three - fifths ( 57 per cent ) of surveyors reported price rises last month , the highest percentage since june 2002 , reflecting the imbalance between supply and demand , @entity9 said			1
and over the three months to october , surveyors sold just over 20 homes typically , the highest average since february 2008 , according to the figures published today			2
looking ahead , they said they expect house prices and sales volumes to edge higher in the next three months			1
meanwhile , demand for rented property is increasing at its slowest pace in over a decade as more people make the jump on or up the property ladder , @entity9 reported			0
but it said that while the new phase of help to buy - to give borrowers with deposits as small as five per cent a helping hand to buy a new - build or existing home - is ' widening the net ' of people who can get mortgage access , surveyors across the @entity37 are reporting a ' problematic ' lack of new instructions from sellers			1
@entity9 said that as ' soaring demand ' pushes prices up , almost every region is reporting an increase in sales , showing that recovery is ' spreading beyond the traditional economic powerhouses of @entity82 and the @entity83 '			1
the new phase of the government 's help to buy scheme , which offers state - backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent , was fired into action last month after the start date was brought forward from january			0
state - backed lenders @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 are already offering mortgages under the scheme			0
other major lenders including @entity98 and @entity99 have confirmed plans to come on board at a later date			0
the @entity18 said that lending to home - buyers between july - september was at the strongest levels since winter 2007 , and said it would help add momentum to the market going into 2014			1
figures from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) out today show the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11 - year high , as this graph illustrates @entity112 , @entity9 chief economist , said : ' a greater willingness by lenders to increase loan to values on mortgage products allied to the help to buy scheme has meant that more and more first - time buyers are in a position to enter the market			1
' in spite of this , the amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand and , in order for the market to function correctly , this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed			0
' @entity131 building starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of the amount of properties needed			0
' housebuilding starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of the amount of properties needed			0
if we are to create a more sustainable market , it is critical that many more good quality homes are built in areas where people want to live			0
' fears have been raised that the upward pressure on house prices could lead to a ' bubble ' , with borrowers over-stretching themselves			2
ultra-low interest rates and a string of @entity85 schemes are currently helping to keep mortgage payments relatively affordable			0
@entity9 recently suggested that the @entity151 should use its powers to limit house price increases to 5 per cent a year to remove the ' froth ' from price booms			1
it said that an annual increase of around 5 per cent could trigger caps on how much people could borrow relative to their incomes or the value of the property			2
help to buy : this graph shows how the number of enquiries from new buyers has also soared with the promise of help from @entity85 to help secure the cash needed for a deposit recent figures from the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) showed that house builders in @entity173 are starting more new properties than at any other time in the past three years			2
but housing charity shelter has previously warned that the country is still building less than half the number of new houses it needs each year to tackle the ' chronic shortage '			2
housing minister @entity181 said : ' we are pulling out all the stops to get @entity37 building			0
' he continued : ' already , we 're well on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015 , and our plans to invest £ 19.5billion public and private funding over this spending review , and £ 23billion in the three years after that , will help towards the fastest rate of affordable housebuilding for two decades			0
' housing starts are now a third higher than at the same time last year and it is clear house building will remain a critical part of our economic recovery			2
' in addition , our help to buy schemes will help thousands of aspiring homeowners buy new homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require - helping to boost the housebuilding industry even further as well as supporting responsible lending			0
' on average households have asked to borrow around £ 155,000 for houses worth about £ 163,000 , which is below the @entity37 average price of £ 247,000			0
