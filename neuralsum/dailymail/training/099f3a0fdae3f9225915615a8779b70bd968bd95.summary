you would n’t need a big restaurant to organise a lunch for the @entity4 teams who have beaten the @entity6 in @entity6			1
it has happened just twice — in 1973 and 2003 — but @entity9 ’s side can join those guys on the top table if they play their cards correctly this week			1
they were very good in @entity13 but in @entity14 they must play like world - beaters			1
this is by a long chalk the biggest week yet for @entity4 under @entity18			1
he has a large squad of hungry , in - form players to select from — and that is a situation that needs to be managed — but this is the moment to go ruthlessly for a result that would firstly define their own careers and then reverberate around the globe			2
they must n’t let this moment pass them by			0
proud : @entity4 's players fought valiantly but were defeated by @entity6 in @entity13 close : @entity4 skipper @entity30 looks dejected after his team 's narrow defeat this is when that proud @entity4 rugby culture and team ethic which @entity9 has worked hard to re-establish must come into its own			1
some players who excelled at @entity38 will need to be dropped — sport can be harsh — but they also need to be valued for their contribution			0
meanwhile , those who were resting in the stands must immediately honour that performance by their colleagues in @entity13 with something very special of their own			2
it ’s a fascinating dynamic and very rarely seen in @entity6 , where an @entity6 win in the first test normally means the series is dead and buried			1
@entity6 are masterly at post-match analysis and ‘ working out ’ the opposition but this time @entity4 can set them entirely fresh problems and challenges			1
decisions : @entity4 coach @entity9 will have some selection choices to make in @entity14 physical : @entity4 went toe to toe with @entity6 on their own back yard in @entity13 assuming no injuries , i would bring @entity62 and @entity63 in at half - back , pair @entity65 and @entity66 at centre and move @entity68 to the left wing			1
up front , despite a very fine performance by @entity72 , @entity70 has to play in the second row and i would bring @entity75 and @entity76 into the back row			0
@entity6 wo n’t concede so many penalties as they did on saturday so @entity4 will need to score two or three tries to win			1
they need the firepower the incomers can provide and conditions will be perfect at the indoor @entity83 and that has to be the focus in training this week			0
this scenario reminds me a lot of the @entity4 tour to @entity90 in 2000			2
the team was developing nicely after the disappointment of the 1999 @entity93 when we lost to @entity95 and @entity90 , but we badly needed a landmark win ‘ on the road ’ against one of the giants to bolster the squad ’s self - belief and rock the rugby world			2
heartbreak : @entity4 must bounce back from their loss and keep the series alive with victory in @entity14 victories on their patch count double			1
we nearly got it in @entity109 , in fact we should have won at @entity111 and i will go to my grave thinking that @entity113 should have been awarded a penalty try when he was taken out trying to dob down his own kick ahead			0
the @entity116 decided otherwise and we finished up losing by five points , the same margin as saturday			0
i remember vividly @entity119 coming off the field that night and being both very angry and positive			0
‘ we have to stop playing well and coming second , it ’s about winning these games , ’ @entity121 snarled at the tv cameras			0
equally i was very impressed and heartened to hear @entity30 straight after saturday ’s game talking about winning the series 2 - 1			0
there were no platitudes about a great performance in defeat and a makeshift team playing bravely and well — which they did — just an immediate grasping of the fantastic opportunity ahead			0
knock - out blow : all @entity6 centre @entity135 scored the decisive try with two minutes left to play time to shine : if @entity4 play their cards right , they can join a small group to have won in @entity4 back in 2000 we headed off to the rugby heartland of @entity143 and in terms of rugby fanaticism and atmosphere , @entity14 wo n’t be far different this week			1
we were expected to make up the numbers			0
@entity109 was our shot at glory but we absolutely believed and the result was a dominating performance and a 27 - 22 win that took everybody by surprise and set us on our way			2
@entity143 was a huge momentum changer in that team ’s evolution			0
after that we did n’t lose to a @entity162 team for four years — 14 straight @entity163 — and @entity4 now have a golden chance to do something similar .			2

@entity4 can join the teams from 1973 and 2003 and win in @entity6
@entity9 's side were excellent in @entity13 , but need to play like world - beaters in @entity14
this week is the biggest yet for @entity4 under coach @entity9
@entity4 were beaten 20 - *15* in the first test in @entity13
