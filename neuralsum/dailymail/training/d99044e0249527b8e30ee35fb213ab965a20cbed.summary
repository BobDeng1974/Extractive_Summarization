these pictures show the hidden life on your phone – the bacteria that lurk on your mobile			2
long after we ’ve swiped and tapped our smart phones , or sent and received texts , our devices retain a biological history of our actions			1
students studying bacteriology at the @entity14 imprinted their mobile phones on to @entity17 dishes to see what they might carry			1
yuck : students from the @entity14 imprinted their phones on @entity17 dishes to culture any bacteria on them			1
here the whole plate is covered by the spreading growth of a bacterium called @entity26 although the results after just three days looked pretty grim , thankfully most of the bacteria were harmless - nevertheless , it just shows the invisible life that can lurk on your phones			1
some disease - carrying bacteria were occasionally found , such as @entity34 - a common cause of staph infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia			1
it is thought that 20 per cent of people are long - term carriers of the bug , which often lurks inside the nasal passages			0
the colonies of bacteria that form after the phone has been imprinted are from the body ’s invisible bacterial flora			2
mostly harmless : but some disease carrying bacteria were occasionally found , such as @entity34 - a common cause of staph infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia the invisible life on your phone : the colonies of bacteria that form after the phone has been imprinted are from the body 's invisible bacterial flora ; they are a tangible and biological residue of our hellos and goodbyes now that the messages have been electronically received or delivered , they represent a tangible and biological residue of our manifold hellos and goodbyes			1
bacteria can utilise many different things as vectors in order to promote their transmission			2
insects , water , food , coughs and sneezes , sexual contact , and rain are just a few examples			0
the mobile phone appears to be no exception this rule			0
unusual but effective way of engaging students : @entity14 lecturer dr @entity86 got undergraduate students in his practical and @entity90 to imprint their mobiles in the growth medium dr @entity93 said : ' it seems that the mobile phone doesn ¿ t just remember telephone numbers , but also harbours a history of our personal and physical contacts such as other people , soil and other matter ' dr @entity86 , senior lecturer in molecular biology , said : ' as part of a course called @entity109 and @entity110 , an undergraduate module that i run , i get the students to imprint their mobile phones on to bacteriological growth @entity17 dishes so that we might determine what they might carry			1
' it 's unusual but a very effective way of engaging our students with the often overlooked microbiology of everyday life			0
' the ecological niche on the body for @entity34 is the nostrils , so a furtive pick of the nose , and quick text after , and you end up with this pathogen on your smartphone			0
' you can clearly see the outline of the phone on this , but the whole plate is covered by the spreading growth of a bacterium called @entity26			0
' this pattern of growth is unique to this bacterium and because soil is its natural habitat , we know that this phone or its user had recently been in contact with soil			0
each phone tells a story			0
' from these results , it seems that the mobile phone does n’t just remember telephone numbers , but also harbours a history of our personal and physical contacts such as other people , soil and other matter			2

@entity14 students imprinted their phones into @entity17 dishes
results showed the devices retain a biological history of our actions
most bacteria were harmless , though some could cause blood poisoning
