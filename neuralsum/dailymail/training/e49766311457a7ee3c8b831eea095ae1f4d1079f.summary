the @entity6 - designed bubble desk has just taken off in @entity7 and protects the worker under a plexiglas dome , cutting them off from the rest of their colleagues			1
it comes as part of a complete office design that includes a giant communal desk , eight @entity18 , a cloakroom and a kitchen			2
it ensures the worker remains detached from the sneezes and banter of daily office life although quite what it does for one 's popularity remains to be seen the @entity29 designed by @entity30 ensures you no longer have to hear or laugh at your colleagues ' jokes bubble desking ensures you do n't catch office germs			1
you may need to step outside though if you want to catch the gossip the bubble desk idea originated in @entity6 by @entity30 and has been taken up by two @entity7 offices the thinking behind the bubble desk is that offers the worker privacy while still being connected to a large , communal desk			1
it is a modern take on partitioned office space popular in the 1980s and which offered privacy but no visibility or sense of connection to colleagues			0
the trees are designed to compensate for the lack of scenery and are rooted into beds of soil buried out of sight			2
so far two @entity6 companies , @entity59 and @entity60 have taken on the office design by @entity30			2
@entity62 from @entity63 , an office design and supply company based in @entity65 , said : ' i can see the benefit of the bubble desk in large public areas such as libraries where people want to shut themselves away and read or something , but i 'm not sure it would work in an office			1
