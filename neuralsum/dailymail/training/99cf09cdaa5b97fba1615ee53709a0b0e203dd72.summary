@entity0 was operating short of safety standards that allow for crew members to survive two separate and unrelated failures , a safety expert has claimed			2
considered best - practice within the industry , the system known as ' two failure tolerance ' is designed to allow for survival if there are two unrelated problems on an aircraft			2
but @entity13 , the former head of fight safety for the @entity15 , said @entity0 's @entity16 had too few safeguards in place to prevent an accident he believes was ' waiting to happen '			1
co-pilot @entity34 was killed in the accident pilot @entity35 was seriously injured			1
feathering systems , which involve rotating the craft 's tail structure , give it the ability to slow down and float like a feather , but are deadly if deployed at the wrong time			2
mr @entity13 has now told the @entity16 's feathering system appeared to be ' one failure tolerant ' , meaning it could withstand one , not two , problems			1
investigators claim the feathering system activated when a lever was mistakenly pulled to unlock it - even though it should require a second lever to be pulled to deploy it , the paper reported			0
@entity0 responded to the claims by saying the feathering locking mechanism used two safeguards - one procedural and one mechanical			0
in the wake of the disaster , mr @entity13 has been highly critical of @entity58 's attempt to pioneer private space travel and claims the company worked in secrecy			1
he said : ‘ they operated in secrecy , which is difficult to understand			0
@entity34 ( left ) was killed in the crash on friday , while co-pilot @entity35 ( right ) survived ' they do n’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design			1
i have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen			0
' the fatal accident has also prompted a review of insurance for adventure trips into space such as those advertised by @entity58 's company			1
a loophole means adventure travelers hoping to head into space - unlike pilots and skydivers - do n't have to take out extra life insurance			0
the loophole exists because @entity88 life insurance policies do n't ask about space tourism or exclude it from coverage , meaning insurers most likely would have to pay if the holder died on a space trip , insurance industry veterans said			0
insurance companies say they are considering what to do about space tourists after the @entity0 crash , and the loophole is likely to be slowly closed .			0

expert claims @entity16 did not meet a ' two failure ' safety standard
