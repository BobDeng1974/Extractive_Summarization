updated : 10:43 est , 9 may 2012 archeologists who uncovered the first homosexual caveman have discovered the prehistoric village where he was ' the only gay ' man			1
the male skeleton - believed to be nearly 6,000 years old - was found buried in the same way that @entity6 communities buried women , suggesting he was a different sexuality			1
now the same team of experts have discovered what they believe was his home village near @entity14 in the @entity15			1
@entity15 archaeologists who uncovered what they believed was the world 's first gay cavemen have located the village he belonged to nearby the long houses found near the grave site are believed to have been the village where the ' gay ' caveman lived dig director @entity25 - from the @entity26 - said : ¿ we have managed to unearth impressions of wooden supporting structures of so - called long houses , typical of the @entity6 period			1
¿ @entity32 : the skeleton was found in a @entity14 suburb with its head pointing eastwards and surrounded by domestic jugs - rituals only previously seen in female graves			2
men would normally be buried with weapons , hammers and flint knives the @entity6 village near the grave site where the ' gay @entity45 man ' dig director @entity25 - from the @entity26 - said : ‘ we have managed to unearth impressions of wooden supporting structures of so - called long houses , typical of the @entity6 period			1
’ the skeleton was originally discovered last year with a series of clues that led experts to believe the grave belonged to a gay man			1
the skeleton of the @entity58 man , unearthed during excavations in the @entity15 , is said to date back to between 2900 and 2500 bc. during that period , men were traditionally buried lying on their right side with the head pointing towards the west ; women on their left side with the head facing east			1
in this case , the man was on his left side with his head facing west			0
another clue is that men tended to be interred with weapons , hammers and flint knives as well as several portions of food and drink to accompany them to the other side			0
women would be buried with necklaces made from teeth , pets , and copper earrings , as well as domestic jugs and an egg - shaped pot placed near the feet			2
the ‘ gay caveman ’ was buried with household jugs , and no weapons			2
archaeologists do not think it was a mistake or coincidence given the importance attached to funerals during the period , known as the @entity100 era because of the pottery it produced			0
from history and ethnology , we know that people from this period took funeral rites very seriously so it is highly unlikely that this positioning was a mistake , ’ said lead researcher @entity112			0
the skeleton was originally discovered last year with a series of clues that led experts to believe the grave belonged to a gay man one of the artefact from archaeological site where the gay caveman was found - believed to date from the neolithic period ‘ far more likely is that he was a man with a different sexual orientation , homosexual or transvestite			1
what we see here does not add up to traditional @entity100 cultural norms			0
’ an oval , egg - shaped container usually associated with female burials was also found at the feet of the skeleton			0
one of the domestic jugs among the caveman 's remains			0
normally only placed in female graves , the jugs suggest the caveman was either homosexual or transsexual another member of the archaeological team , @entity144 , said that colleagues had uncovered an earlier case dating from the @entity148 period where a female warrior was buried as a man			2
she added that @entity152 shamans , or witch doctors , were also buried in this way but with richer funeral accessories appropriate to their elevated position in society			0
‘ this later discovery was neither of those			0
we believe this is one of the earliest cases of what could be described as a transvestite or third - gender grave in the @entity15			2

long houses near where lone male skeleton was buried amongst women
*urn* and lack of weapons suggests he was buried ' as a woman '
@entity6 community may have buried him *separately* as a gay man or *possibly* a transvestite
