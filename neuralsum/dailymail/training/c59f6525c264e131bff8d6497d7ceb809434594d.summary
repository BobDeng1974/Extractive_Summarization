brave @entity0 spoke for the first time about the tragedy that killed his close friend , co-pilot @entity3 , revealing that he gave a passing plane a thumbs up to show that he was alive the pilot who miraculously survived the @entity8 spaceship disaster has revealed how he was blasted from the wreckage of the disintegrating rocket ship and plummeted nearly ten miles back to @entity11			1
having suffered serious injuries , the experienced test pilot only regained consciousness halfway into his fall but was composed enough to give a thumbs - up to colleagues in a passing aircraft to show he was alive			1
brave @entity0 spoke for the first time about the tragedy that killed his close friend , co-pilot @entity3 , revealing he blacked out as the craft broke up around him at 50,000ft but was saved by his emergency parachute			1
@entity0 , 43 , a married father of two , said : ‘ i must have lost consciousness at first			1
i ca n’t remember anything about what happened but i must have come to during the fall			2
i remember waving to the chase plane and giving them the thumbs - up to tell them i was ok			2
i know it ’s a miracle i survived			2
’ the @entity33 can reveal that despite his injuries , @entity0 – who is yet to speak to crash investigators – returned home to his family on monday , just three days after sir @entity32 ’s @entity31 tore apart			1
he gave his amazing account of survival to his father , dr @entity40 , who visited him yesterday at his modest £ 150,000 ranch home in @entity42 , @entity43 , on the edge of the @entity45 where the spaceship crashed			1
dr @entity0 , who is also a pilot , travelled to @entity43 from his home in @entity48 to see his son			1
he told @entity33 that @entity0 was ‘ in good spirits ’ despite suffering serious injuries , including a shattered shoulder			1
both pilots were strapped into standard pilot seats and wearing thin flight suits and emergency parachutes when @entity31 was released from its mothership @entity56 shortly after 10am on october 31			2
the craft ’s rocket was ignited at 50,000ft – nearly ten miles above sea level			2
the pilots , wearing oxygen masks , were pinned against their seats by gravitational forces as the craft accelerated at more than 900mph			2
preliminary investigations suggest that the rocket ship ’s folding wings – designed to slow it down and achieve safe speeds during landing – deployed early , causing the ship to break up due to the tremendous turbulence around the craft			2
@entity3 was trapped in the cockpit but @entity0 was thrown clear of the wreckage or somehow unbuckled his seatbelt			1
he then plunged towards @entity11 at speeds topping 120mph			1
witnesses reported seeing @entity0 descending with part of the base of his seat still attached			1
it is likely that his oxygen mask , attached to a portable tank , remained in place			0
but at that altitude , the sudden decompression and extreme g - forces would have caused him to black out in seconds			0
his emergency parachute deployed at around 20,000ft			0
it is not known if he pulled the cord or if it unfurled automatically			0
both pilots were wearing parachutes calibrated to open automatically at a certain height in the event they became unconscious during an emergency			0
dr @entity0 , 79 , explained : ‘ he does n’t know how he managed to exit @entity31			1
they do n’t have an ejection seat			0
they have a panel they take out and they have to crawl towards the hole and jump out			0
but the plane broke up suddenly			0
i ’m sure he was unconscious because he could not have maintained consciousness at 50,000ft			2
co-pilot @entity3 was killed in the tragedy over the @entity45 ‘ he does n’t remember anything from the actual crash			1
he came to during the descent			0
he must have woken up about halfway down			0
when he was on the way down the chase plane was circling him and he was waving and giving the thumbs - up to indicate he was all right while he was dangling from the parachute			2
‘ he ’s recovering at home			2
he broke the head of the humerus bone that sits in the right shoulder			0
he ’s got a rib and lung contusion and there is an issue with his eyes because of the cold			0
it was around minus 60 degrees up there			0
‘ it ’s a medical miracle he survived considering the temperature , the lack of oxygen and the barotrauma [ injury caused by a sudden change in pressure ]			0
’ the pilot ’s horrified wife , @entity142 , and children 12 - year - old @entity138 and @entity139 , nine , were standing with the family of @entity3 as the tragedy unfolded			1
the body of @entity147 , 39 , was found still strapped into his seat on a desert road by construction workers			0
his parachute did not deploy			0
his wife @entity152 said she had ‘ lost the love of my life ’			2
dr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s children and my grandchildren were all watching the flight so the emotional impact of that is tremendous			1
‘ @entity3 was a friend and neighbour			1
their children are the same age and friends			0
@entity0 is asking himself whether he could have done more and why he got out and @entity3 did n’t ? @entity142 is a strong woman			1
she ’s drained but very much in charge			0
‘ she ’s protecting @entity0 and she ’s holding up incredibly well most of the time			1
he ’s on pain medication , which is making him tired and confused			0
’ the plane separated mid-air , causing @entity3 , 39 , to plummet to the earth while still strapped in his seat dr @entity0 , who split with @entity0 ’s mother @entity172 when his son was five , spoke proudly of teaching his son to fly : ‘ flying was the only thing @entity0 was ever really interested in			1
i flew privately – that was my recreation – so he grew up with it			0
it ’s what we did together			0
we would go to the airport after school			0
’ at 16 , @entity0 studied aviation at @entity185 and landed a job with @entity187 – the company conducting last week ’s test flight for @entity189 – before he graduated			1
‘ he worked as an engineer and pilot , starting from the bottom and working his way up , ’ dr @entity0 said proudly			1
@entity0 began working as a test pilot and engineer with @entity189 at the start of its space programme a decade ago			1
‘ he told me straight away he was involved with @entity189 , ’ his father continued			1
‘ safety was a great concern but i had total confidence in his piloting skills			0
‘ @entity0 would say , “ these airplanes fly just beautifully			1
” ‘ he was never worried about the safety aspect of it			0
’ the october 31 flight was so routine that dr @entity0 had no idea his son was piloting the pioneering craft that day until his panicked daughter - in - law phoned : ‘ i picked up the phone oblivious to what had happened			1
i said , “ hi @entity142 , how are you ? ” cheerful as usual and she said , “ it ’s serious			0
we do n’t know exactly but it looks like he hurt his shoulder and he ’s on his way to the hospital			0
” ‘ we were worried but the main thing was we knew he was alive			2
‘ i hope he ’s going to recover enough to be able to fly again			0
we ’re focusing hour to hour rather than day to day			0
’ yesterday , it was revealed that 24 passengers who have paid £ 157,000 each for the chance to go into space – alongside celebrities including @entity234 and @entity235 – have demanded their money back			0
@entity189 chief executive @entity237 claimed it was ‘ unsurprising ’ passengers had pulled out , adding : ‘ i think what is relevant is that the vast majority have said , “ do n’t give up , keep going , we ’re with you			1
” ’ before the accident , billionaire sir @entity32 vowed he and son @entity244 would become astronauts by the end of this year and the first space tourist flights would begin next spring			0
but the @entity189 project has been beset by years of delays and safety fears , including previous accidents with @entity252 which necessitated a redesign of the ship ’s engines and fuel			1
the investigation into this month ’s crash is now likely to delay any commercial flight for at least another year			2
but @entity32 has vowed to press ahead with the project , while acknowledging the risks taken by his test pilots			0
last night , mr @entity237 paid tribute to @entity0 , saying : ‘ it will be regarded as one of the most amazing test flight survival stories of all time			1
’ dr @entity40 , @entity0 's father , criticised those who ' rushed ' to blame human error for the crash the father of the @entity189 pilot who survived the crash has hit out at the ‘ rush ’ to blame human error			1
within days of the tragedy , @entity277 ( @entity276 ) staff claimed co-pilot @entity279 , who died , wrongly flicked a safety switch controlling the rocket ’s folding wings			2
that would cause them to deploy at an unsafe speed and ‘ feather ’ – slowing down the rocket			0
but dr @entity40 , father of surviving pilot @entity0 , claimed a second switch would have had to be deployed to cause feathering			1
dr @entity0 , himself a pilot and flight instructor , said : ‘ turning the safety lever wo n’t automatically feather the tail			1
‘ the fact that the tail was feathered without a pilot ordering it to do so suggests a mechanical problem , not pilot error			2
‘ it ’s really irresponsible for the @entity276 to suggest a possible explanation for the accident with months of investigation still to come			0
’ a statement on the @entity189 website says : ‘ the @entity276 indicated that the lock / unlock lever was pulled prematurely based on recorded speed at the time , and they have suggested that subsequent aerodynamic forces then deployed the feathering mechanism , which resulted in the in - flight separation of the wings and vehicle			1
’ an investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the crash over the @entity45 desert			2
