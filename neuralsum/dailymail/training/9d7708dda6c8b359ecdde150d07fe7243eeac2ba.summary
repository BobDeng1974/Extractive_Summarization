by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 majority leader @entity2 refused wednesday to explain how he lost his seat in @entity5 a day earlier , telling reporters in @entity7 that he would ' leave the political analysis to y'all			1
' he flatly refused to navel - gaze about whether his stance on illegal immigration signaled the end of his political career , or to speculate on whether he had drifted too far away from his conservative base and joined the dreaded ' @entity17 establishment			1
' responding to a question about the conservative - moderate divide plaguing the @entity17 , he would say only that ' what divides @entity17 pales in comparison to what divides us conservatives from the left			2
' @entity2 , who lost his @entity17 primary tuesday night in a result that left the @entity17 shell - shocked , said just 18 hours later that he would step down as @entity29 on july 31			1
he endorsed majority whip @entity43 for the job			1
@entity43 , a @entity46 serving in his fourth term , is currently the majority whip , the official in charge of ' whipping ' votes and maintaining party discipline			1
' i will be backing him with my full support , ' @entity2 announced			0
despite widespread beliefs that his willingness to embrace some reforms to the @entity1 immigration system ultimately cost him the primary election , @entity2 said his views have n't changed			1
' i have always said the system is broken			0
it needs reforms ... one step at a time , ' he said			0
he was particularly rankled by the cases of so - called " @entity65 , " illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity1 as children			0
' i would like to see the issues of the kids addressed , ' he said			0
but the @entity34 drew a sharp line between his position and the @entity3 's : ' i do n't believe in this my way or the highway approach that the president has laid out			2
' @entity33 , a political unknown who teaches economics at @entity79 in @entity34 , took 56 per cent of the vote on tuesday , driven by @entity82 ' fears that increased immigration would choke off jobs and lower wages			2
brat persuaded voters that @entity2 , despite his preference for a limited slice of immigration reform options , backed a @entity92 - style ' amnesty ' program that would give 11 million illegal immigrants a path to @entity1 citizenship			2
meet the press : @entity98 majority leader @entity2 of @entity34			2
said after a @entity3 @entity17 caucus meeting that he will resign his leadership post on july 31 @entity2 said he had no regrets about his seven terms in @entity5			1
' we @entity3 @entity17 have made some tremendous strides over the past few years , ' he said , citing his party 's advocacy for school vouchers , medical research , budget cuts and ' protecting the elderly ' from @entity111			1
' we forced the reduction of spending in @entity7 in consecutive years for the first time since the @entity115 , ' he said			0
pressed on his sudden lack of tea party credentials – points that swung to brat on tuesday – @entity2 admonished the press not to misunderstand the movement 's purpose			1
' remember what @entity122 stands for : taxed enough already , ' he said			1
' all of us conservative republicans believe in that			0
' ' conservatives have solutions that can help alleviate the middle - class squeeze and provide opportunity for all			0
' @entity33 , right , defeated @entity2 in the @entity17 primary on tuesday , marking one of the most improbable @entity1 political victories in the history of party primaries he also slammed @entity137 for allowing ' a stack of bills ' to accumulate – legislation already passed in the @entity3 – despite their habit of referring to @entity142 as a ' do - nothing ' caucus			1
@entity2 also pushed back against claims that he had spent more time hobnobbing with donors and working with lobbyists , as part of his leadership role , than working on his constituents ' needs			0
' i was in my district every week , ' he insisted			0
' there 's a balance			0
... never was there a day when i did not put the citizens of the 7th @entity157 first			0

@entity2 took questions in a brief *session* following an *emergency* meeting of the @entity3 @entity17 caucus
the second most powerful @entity17 in the @entity3 was *bounced* from his *congressional* seat tuesday night by a political unknown
he insisted that his views on immigration , which may have cost him the primary election , have n't changed
but @entity2 insisted that rifts between establishment republicans and tea party *factions* are *overblown*
' remember what @entity122 stands for : taxed enough already , ' he said ; ' all of us conservative @entity17 believe in that '
@entity2 endorsed @entity46 @entity43 rep. @entity43 , the @entity3 majority whip , to take his place after he steps down from the leadership post on july 31
