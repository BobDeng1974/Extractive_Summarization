by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:42 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 made history today after it charged three youths with murder before their alleged victim had died			1
two 14 - year - olds and a 16 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , have appeared in court accused of stabbing to death @entity12			1
detectives decided to charge the teenagers while the market stall holder was still in hospital , because doctors said his injuries were so severe he was certain to die			1
the 29 - year - old of @entity22 , east @entity23 , was stabbed two days ago at a street market in @entity25 , also in east @entity23			1
' the victim remains at an east @entity23 hospital , however his injuries will prove fatal and consequently the three youths have been accused of murder , ' a @entity40 spokesman said			1
today 's decision to charge three boys with murder before the victim was dead may be the the first time it has happened in @entity53 legal history , it emerged today			1
the @entity40 's decision overnight marks a new but subtle change in the way some killings could be dealt with going forward			2
sources at @entity3 said the charges were brought in advance to ensure a fair trial for the three teenagers			2
for hundreds of years any victim of murder had to be dead and police would have to have a body to proceed with a murder case			2
this was imposed after a 17th century trial where several men were hanged only for their alleged victims to appear alive and well afterwards			2
this framework remained until 1954 , where it changed and forensic science improved			0
a farmer in @entity77 was accused of murdering his friend after blood and bone fragments were found in his kitchen			0
@entity82 , who stayed in @entity53 after the war , said his business partner had returned to @entity85 , but police believed he was murdered			2
despite the lack of a body the jury found him guilty and this allowed suspects to be tried for murder based on circumstantial evidence			0
in recent years the most high profile use of this interpretation of the law was used to prosecute killer @entity96 , above , who was charged with the abduction and murder of @entity96 in october 2012			2
officers took the decision even though hundreds of police and locals in the @entity77 town of @entity108 were then still hunting for the five - year - old , whose body was never found			1
the force later issued a statement saying : ' mr @entity12 was pronounced dead this morning at @entity112			1
a post-mortem examination will be conducted in due course			0
' similar decisions have been made when a body can not be found , like in the case of @entity96 who murdered five - year - old @entity96 and hid her			1
but @entity121 sources admitted it could be a first in these circumstances			0
the three teenagers appeared at @entity125 this afternoon jointly charged with mr @entity12 's murder			1
magistrates chairman @entity127 transferred their case to the @entity129 for another hearing on thursday			0
their alleged victim ran a mobile phone stall in @entity134 , @entity25			1
police suspect he believed that the gang were stealing from him and a struggle ensued and mr @entity12 was stabbed			1
he was rushed to the @entity112 where his condition was said to be critical			0
but he deteriorated and was pronounced dead earlier this morning			1
a post-mortem examination is now due to take place			0
witnesses to the attack have told of their horror after seeing the trader attacked			0
@entity146 , 25 , a pregnant mother - of - one , was walking through the market with her two - year - old daughter when she saw the 29 - year - old collapse to the ground bleeding heavily			1
she said : ' people were trying to break them up because they thought they were fighting , we did n't realise he was stabbed until he fell and we saw the blood			2
' he stood up again and looked kind of drowsy and then fell over again			0
the blood was pouring out			0
' that man was working very hard for little money			0
they come at 4am when they open their stall , they are working very hard and somebody comes by , picks up their things and its the difference between life and death			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
