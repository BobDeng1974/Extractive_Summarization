will children of the future be taught solely by a computer ? that could be a possibility , according to @entity6 's vice-president of research @entity7			1
he said he thinks apps and technologies that are widely derided as being distracting could actually improve how we learn			2
and he says this may lead to a future where students do not need to go to school in order to get a formal education			2
@entity6 's @entity7 ( shown ) says technology could replace teachers in future			1
he made the comments at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
tech we usually find distracting could be used to help students learn			1
he says even simple apps could improve their educational experience ( stock image shown ) speaking at the @entity31 's @entity23 in @entity24 earlier this week , he said even simple apps could improve education			1
he points to apps already on the market like @entity35 , which teaches languages through games , as beginning the shift to technology - based learning			1
learning to read @entity40 - the tactile writing system used by people who are blind and visually impaired - is notoriously difficult			0
to make this a little easier , researchers have designed vibrating gloves that help people learn to read and write @entity40 with minimal effort			2
vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves buzz to tell a wearer to press a corresponding key , and the system tells them which letter they are typing			0
' the process is based on passive haptic learning ( @entity59 ) , ' said @entity60 , a @entity61 professor involved in the project			0
' we 've learned that people can acquire motor skills through vibrations without devoting active attention to their hands			0
' and he says that personal artificially intelligent tutors could be the next step to raise education levels for students even more			2
' if it were the case that technology could become custom tutors , then it 's possible to imagine enormous improvements in educational attainment , ' he said			0
and he continued that video games could be used to take the boredom out of studying , creating environments in which learning can be exciting			1
' we have user interfaces that are so exciting that people play video games for hours and hours a day , and they could be educated by them , ' he said			2
social networks could also be used to increase students ' social skills , helping them communicate with one another more easily			0
ultimately , mr @entity7 says that these technologies combined could eradicate the need for schools			0
' in the past it seemed you had to go to a school to get formal education - there was no choice but to go to isolated places to be educated , but now we do n't have to do that , ' he said			0
' we may choose to but we do n't have to			0
' mr @entity7 ( left ) also says video games could also be used to take the boredom out of studying			1
and it may lead to a future where @entity108 serves as personal tutors			1
ultimately he says this may reduce the need for school ( stock image shown right ) both for educational needs and socially as well thanks to social networks			0
