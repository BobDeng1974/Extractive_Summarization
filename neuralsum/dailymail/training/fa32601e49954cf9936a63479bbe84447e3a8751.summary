@entity0 defended @entity2 's performance as the @entity4 striker came under criticism again after a @entity7 performance			1
@entity2 , who has never scored in three @entity8 , endured a frustrating game at times though he laid on @entity4 's goal with a great cross for @entity12 starting on the left and then playing on the right in the second half before going centrally for the final quarter of the game			1
tough time : @entity4 's @entity2 shows his frustration during @entity20 game @entity0 said : ' we wanted to get @entity22 around because of his agility and of course that meant moving @entity2 and i thought that worked well , he set up the goal for us , he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre			1
there 's always going to be one player who there 's a big debate around but i think it 's very harsh to criticise @entity2 's performance today because for me he played			1
' @entity0 did concede that @entity2 and @entity35 had been exposed in the first half by the attacks of the runs of right back @entity39 and significantly @entity41 was moved to the left in the second half to cover him			1
' we did struggle in the first half there in particular but i think much less in the second half , although we got caught upfield for the goal , ' he said			2
match facts : @entity2 set up @entity4 equaliser ( left ) but only touched the ball twice in @entity20 penalty area ' you ca n't recover when you go forward as much as we do			1
we got forward as well but his fun forward helped produce the cross that got them the winning goal			2
' despite the defeat @entity0 singled out his young attacking players for praise			1
' i thought all the young players did well			0
i thought @entity12 had an exceptional time until he got the dead leg			0
i thought @entity22 was as bright as we thought he would be			1
' i thought @entity66 when he came on did some very good things			2
i thought @entity68 was showing all the right intentions			0
and of course we know what @entity41 can give us			2
none of those players let me down today			0
they all did what we were hoping â€“ except score an equalising goal			0
' high and wide : @entity4 striker @entity2 fires a shot over the bar against @entity20 @entity0 confirmed that physio @entity79 will have to return home , with @entity81 taking over responsibilities , after dislocating his ankle in the celebrations for @entity4 's goal			1
he said : ' it 's very sad			0
he jumped up and landed on a water bottle			0
he 's been taken to hospital			0
it was very , very painful			0
the doctor was able to set it at the side of the field but it 's the @entity95 for @entity79 and a sad moment for him and the team			0

@entity2 started on the left and then moved to the right
@entity4 striker and @entity35 were exposed in the first *-* half
@entity0 *pleased* with @entity22 , @entity41 and @entity66
