at first glance , you would n’t even think it ’s a seat			0
the @entity3 , which i ’m getting acquainted with in the picture on the right , looks like some fiendish device designed for torture			1
but this extraordinary item is , in fact , the most elaborate , painstakingly constructed and expensive office chair in the world			1
it is designed to counteract what is arguably the most common health problem : a bad back			1
about 7.6 million working days are lost to this complaint annually in @entity18			0
sitting pretty : @entity19 tries out the £ 8,000 @entity3 chair , the latest in ergonomically design , to help with posture the catch is that the chair costs almost £ 8,000			1
yes , £ 8,000 ! so what makes it so special ? ‘ it allows more freedom of movement than any other chair i ’ve ever seen , ’ says posture expert @entity27 , who has brought the @entity3 chair to the @entity18			1
‘ if you are spending many hours at a desk , it ’s the only chair that will actually maintain your health			1
as you sit in it , you are constantly making micro-movements , which is what you need to do to keep your back healthy			2
‘ sitting is one of the biggest problems for modern human health			0
we have legs , not roots			0
we were designed to move			0
’ it feels like flying ! when you sit on the @entity3 , a carbon - fibre shell wraps around each leg			1
each shell can pivot independently so , after getting my balance , i found i could stretch , lean and twist forwards , backwards and from side to side			2
it ’s a bit like flying			0
you also feel like smiling – not an emotion i usually associate with being seated at a desk , especially as i have a dodgy back			2
by enabling you to move so freely , the chair is said to stimulate the limbic area of the brain – the seat of emotions – and so make you feel happier , too			1
happy back : the @entity3 chair offers constant micro-movements , which is what you need to do to keep your back healthy out of the @entity77 root of my back problem lies in a couple of herniated discs near the base of my spine , along with a bunch of muscle imbalances too dull to divulge			1
suffice to say the result is that a normal office chair – one that obliges my spine to rest at 90 degrees to my thighs – soon becomes painful to use			2
i ’ve tried all sorts of alternatives			0
for years i had a ‘ kneeling chair ’ – a backless contraption that lets you sit with your knees lower than your hips – but i later learned it ’s not recommended for all - day use			1
osteopath @entity101 recommends five things to help preserve your posture and your spine while in the office			0
and none costs more than £ 60 ! @entity108 £ 54 this provides everything you need from an office chair – it swivels , its height and angle can be changed , and it is @entity114 @entity116 £ @entity115 is crucial to have a monitor at eye level – any lower and your back will round as you look down			1

this stand helps you keep a better position			0
must be used with an external keyboard wellworking.co.uk the @entity128 £ 18.99 a piece of foam that fixes to your chair , this preserves the natural curve of the back , which most of us lose when sitting			1
@entity135 @entity137 £ 49.95allows documents to be held at an angle , otherwise you will stoop			2
@entity139 i also invested in a @entity142 saddle seat , which looks like a saddle on a pole and felt comfortable			0
then my physio said that a seat with a back would be kinder to my ageing vertebrae , to give them an occasional rest			2
but do i really need to invest in the @entity3 ? @entity160 ‘ for people who do n’t have an injury , there is fairly standard guidance on what is a good sitting posture , ’ says @entity151 , senior lecturer in ergonomics at the @entity153			1
‘ that means feet flat on the floor , knees at 90 degrees , a 90 - degree bend at the pelvis , and support throughout			2
‘ but you ca n’t generalise about people who have an injury as each problem is different , which is why it ’s best to get an occupational nurse to inspect your seating and to give advice			0
‘ some people stick cushions on to a chair so it feels nice , but the best thing is to get up from your desk regularly and walk about			2
that will help relieve the pressure on your spine and move fluid around the vertebrae to keep everything working smoothly			0
’ osteopath @entity101 is adamant that most of us need n’t break the bank to stave off , or cope with , back pain			0
‘ it is ridiculous to think you have to spend £ 8,000 to achieve good posture , ’ he says			1
‘ this chair is designed to keep you mobile but you could get similar benefits from sitting on a @entity196 ball or a saddle stool , which separates your legs slightly			0
both can be bought for less than £ 40			0
‘ anyone with major back ache should speak to a doctor or osteopath			0
ultimately , exercise will mobilise your back and stimulate your limbic system more than any chair – however expensive it is			1

the @entity3 chair has a carbon - fibre shell which wraps around each leg
with each leg moving *individually* it gives freedom of movement
limbic chair costs £ 8,000 - but there are *cheaper* ways to a good back
