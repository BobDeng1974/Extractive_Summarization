published : 13:06 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 9 june 2013 a @entity1 photographer who snapped pictures of his neighbors as they dwelled inside their own apartments and turned them into high - priced art is fighting back against privacy lawsuit as his blown up prints hit a @entity9 gallery			1
not too far from his own apartment in the @entity14 neighborhood , photographer @entity11 ’s work is now onsale at the @entity15 in @entity16 for up to $ 7,500			1
meanwhile , some subjects of his work are unhappy they ’re naps and other everyday acts have been transformed into art without their consent			0
@entity11 , who says his neighbors are ‘ performing behind a transparent scrim on a stage of their own creation with the curtain raised high , ’ has filed a motion to dismiss legal complaints that he ’s broken the law			1
uncomfortably close : @entity11 secretly took shots of his neighbors doing everyday things like napping in their own homes with a zoom lens			1
his work now hangs in a @entity9 gallery and some of his subjects are unhappy the photographer says he ' started the project after inheriting a telephoto lens from a friend			2
he began taking pictures of the large - windowed apartments opposite his own @entity14 home in 2012			0
those images are now on show , which prompted a legal complaint from @entity48 and @entity49 , parents of young children featured in two of his photographs			1
the @entity52 said the pictures raised concerns about the safety of their children as well as fears that they ‘ must keep their shades drawn at all hours of the day in order to avoid telephoto photography by a neighbor			2
’ aptly named : the exhibit , called ' the @entity66 ' hands at @entity9 's @entity15 gallery doubly awkward : when @entity11 's work showed up at @entity15 , the parents of two children who appeared in the exhibit complained and those photos have since been removed whose right ? @entity11 took pictures of the dwellers of this @entity14 apartment building			1
one couple now demands his photos of their household be removed from the artist 's possession for the rest of @entity9 , the controversy over the exhibition has triggered a conversation about first amendment rights and just how much privacy city dwellers can expect			1
in the latest development , @entity11 is claiming he ’s done nothing wrong			1
on wednesday , his attorney filed a motion calling for the @entity9 county court to throw out the @entity52 ' complaint			0
the motion argues that the pictures are not illegal and are protected under an artist 's freedom of expression under first amendment rights			2
@entity11 is no longer commenting on the controversy , but says in his exhibition notes : ‘ for my subjects , there is no question of privacy … the neighbors do n't know they are being photographed ; i carefully shoot from the shadows of my home into theirs			1
’ high art : @entity11 defends his work in his exhibit notes , ' they 're performing behind a transparent scrim on a stage of their own creation with the curtain raised high ' the photographs themselves are both abstract and specific , capturing mundane but intimate moments of domestic modern life			1
all are carefully framed to avoid revealing the full faces of their subjects			0
a woman in a raincoat stands by the window , her face obscured by a twisted gold curtain			2
a man in t - shirt and jeans dozes on a sofa			0
an expectant mother is pictured in profile			0
the lower halves of a couple in bath robes are caught breakfasting , their feet touching under the table			0
another woman is crouched near the window , scrubbing the floor or picking something off the ground			0
obscured ? ' for my subjects , there is no question of privacy , ' @entity11 says			2
' the neighbors do n't know they are being photographed ; i carefully shoot from the shadows of my home into theirs			0
' the @entity52 ' complaint details the couple 's distress about two photos that feature their children			2
one image shows @entity162 holding her 2 - year - old son , with her 4 - year - old daughter standing beside her			0
the girl is in a swim suit ; the boy is wearing a diaper			0
the document alleges that the minors ' faces are ‘ clearly recognizable , ’ which could endanger their safety by attracting the attention of ‘ undesirable and potentially dangerous people			0
’ @entity11 's legal motion of june 5 asserts that neither his conduct nor photographs violate any @entity9 laws			1
the document adds that as the images ‘ were taken through windows that are fully exposed to the street , they can not support a claim for intentional infliction of severe emotional distress			0
’ with regard to the photos that feature the @entity52 , the motion states that the faces of the parents are not revealed , the children are obscured and the subjects are in plain view			2
‘ both photographs capture children at play and the innocence of childhood , nothing more revealing than you might see in a neighborhood park , ’ the document says			0
it asserts that @entity11 's images are protected by @entity207 rights and that the ‘ plaintiffs should not be permitted to use the court to attempt to restrict artistic expressions that they disagree with			1
’ the plaintiffs say they are ‘ frightened and angered ’ by the ‘ utter disregard for their privacy and the privacy of their children ’ and the ‘ seclusion and solitude of their homes			0
’ birds - eye view : @entity11 shot the photos with a zoom lens he says he inherited from a friend			1
seen here is his position at left and the building he photographed at right the complaint adds that @entity11 's conduct is ‘ so out of keeping with the standards of morality in the community as to evince an intentional or reckless disregard of its likelihood to cause severe emotional distress to the @entity52			1
’ although @entity11 removed the pictures from the exhibition when contacted by an attorney , the @entity52 still want to remove all remaining pictures from the photographer 's possession , a permanent injunction against further photographic intrusions , plus damages and costs			1
@entity15 , the gallery owner and director , told @entity252 that the reaction to the exhibition was a ‘ huge surprise ’ and a ‘ tempest in a teapot			0
’ compensation : a woman takes her own picture at @entity11 's exhibit			1
the @entity49 family is suing him for intruding on their privacy , want photos of their children returned , as well damages and costs ‘ it really never occurred to me that there would any of the controversial issues surrounding the work because historically there have been lots and lots of photographers who have photographed on the street , through windows , there 's a whole history of it , ’ she said			1
@entity282 , an attorney and general counsel for the @entity284 , described the case as ‘ very interesting			0
’ ‘ most people have this sense in @entity9 because everybody lives so close together , because the line sights are such , that you can very easily look into your neighbors ' apartment and they can look into yours , but i think the court may parse this out as looking is one thing and photographing is another , ’ he told @entity252			0
revealing : a woman takes in ' @entity301 ' at @entity9 's @entity15 unanticipated : gallery owner @entity15 speaks with guests at her gallery june 1			2
' it really never occurred to me that there would any of the controversial issues ' @entity282 is concerned that a ruling in this case could ‘ create more pushback by people who are looking to create an expectation of privacy even when you 're out in public			2
’ he thinks this could lead to @entity207 protections being ‘ chipped away			0
’ @entity282 believes that this case has been a negative one for the image of photography and first amendment rights due to the ‘ bad taste ’ that has been left with the public			0
the attorney believes that the case against @entity11 may ‘ turn more on the facts of the case than on the actual law			2
’ while the case remains in the hands of the @entity331 system , the issues raised by @entity11 's photographs are as ethical as they are legal			1
@entity332 said : ‘ if it 's an ethical issue i think it 's about the individual , and the way that @entity11 has handled this work is incredibly respectful and ethical			1
’ clearly , others disagree			0
pricey : pieces in @entity11 's collection are garnering upwards of $ 7,500			1
