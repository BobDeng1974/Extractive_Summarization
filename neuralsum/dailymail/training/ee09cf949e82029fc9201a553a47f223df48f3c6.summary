a pair of mysterious fast - moving discs of light have been pictured in the skies over the @entity5 town of @entity6			1
@entity7 , 42 , was making a phone call outside the town 's @entity9 when he spotted the ufos at 8pm on friday			1
the driving instructor from @entity13 , @entity14 , said : ' i was drinking with my girlfriend and her son			0
' the truth is out there : these two discs of light were spotted flying at speed above the @entity5 town of @entity6 by a shocked pubgoer he added : ' i went outside to make a phone call when something caught my attention			1
' it was around 8pm at night so there was a little bit of sun but it was mainly overcast			0
' it was heading south west and quicker than any normal aircraft			0
' i only saw it for less than five seconds			0
' i have seen a lot of funny things in the sky and i have always practised trying to take a photo quickly on my mobile phone			2
' i am interested to see if anyone else saw it and whether there were any other witnesses			0
' i really want to know what is going on out there - there probably is life out there			0
' mr @entity7 posted the photo to @entity50 to get his friends ' perspective on the mystery and and now wants to hear from anyone else who saw the @entity55			1
i want to believe : mr @entity7 has asked other people in @entity6 who may have seen the @entity55 to get in touch with him a former @entity59 ( @entity59 ) @entity55 expert says the photo is ' one of the best ' he has seen			1
@entity63 , who investigated reports of @entity55 sightings from 1991 to 1994 , said : ' the shape and colour seems to rule out things like aircraft lights or @entity71 lanterns			2
' it would be interesting to know if anyone else saw this , or if anything unusual was tracked on radar			0
' this is the second @entity55 sighting over @entity6 this year after a mystery object was spotted just two miles from where this photo was taken			1
in february a man , who wished to remain anonymous , said it he saw an object which was orange , bright red and yellow , which ' streaked across the sky for all of three seconds '			2
a @entity55 expert described the picture as one of the best he has ever seen			1
file picture earlier this month three passenger jets sighted ufos above @entity94 's scientology headquarters on their approach to @entity97 , according to a recently - revealed report			2
their pilots each saw ' two flat , silver discs ' , with some flying within 100ft			0
air traffic control then spotted six ufos on their radars before they suddenly disappeared			0
investigators offered the possibility the objects could have been balloons or kites but , with the @entity55 remaining untraced , the incidents were deemed not possible to assess .			1

he has asked for others who saw the *inexplicable* objects to get in touch
