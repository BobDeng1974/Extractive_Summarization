by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 20:13 est , 10 april 2012 @entity2 authorities have been frustrated in their attempts to file criminal charges against the young father of a baby born to a 10 - year - old ethnic @entity8 girl			1
the @entity8 people have their own justice system and rarely co-operate with agents of the @entity2 state in such matters , @entity9 , chief prosecutor in @entity10 , the regional capital , said yesterday			1
under @entity2 law , any sexual relations with a child age 14 or younger is a crime punishable by at least nine years in prison			1
frustrated : the @entity2 authorities say they are not getting any co-operation from members of the @entity8 tribe as they investigate the young father of this baby born to a 10 - year - old girl mother : the girl , a member of the northern indigenous @entity8 tribe in the @entity29 , was 39 weeks pregnant when she underwent a @entity30 but legal and indigenous affairs experts say that under @entity2 's 1991 constitution the @entity8 have jurisdiction			1
the girl , who can not be identified by law , gave birth on march 29 via caesarean section and is one of the youngest mothers on record			1
the father , who authorities say is 15 , also can not be identified			0
the baby weighed 5.6lbs ( 2.6kg ) and measured 14.5ins ( 47cm ) , said dr @entity44 , who delivered the child in a private clinic in @entity10 , on the @entity29 in @entity2 's northeast coast			0
dr @entity44 said ' she barely understood what was happening ' at the moment of birth			2
he added he had to operate because at that age the pelvis is still growing ' and it 's too small for the fetus to pass through the vaginal canal			2
' home : the town of @entity59 is in the northern @entity29 of @entity2 he said the mother , who was discharged from the clinic in good health , is also relatively short at 4ft , 7ins ( 142cm )			2
when nurses took the newborn to her mother ' it was as if a doll was being given to her , ' said dr @entity44			2
' she has no idea			0
she does n't understand anything and that 's normal , ' he added			0
the doctor said it was not the first time he had delivered the baby of a 10 - year - old girl			2
he said he had a similar case last year			0
in the latest case , the girl 's parents took her to the clinic from their hometown of @entity83			0
shame : the birth has been painful for the @entity8 ( file picture ) , who mostly live on the @entity2 - @entity89 border			1
but they do not believe she was raped a @entity8 tribal leader , @entity92 , said the parents were refusing to speak to the media out of shame			1
she said the incident was also painful for the @entity8 , who number about 350,000 and mostly live in the @entity2 - @entity89 border region			1
they do n't consider that the girl was raped but rather that the baby was conceived in consensual sex			0
it will be up to the parents of both the boy and girl to decide whether the two should be married and what the boy 's family owes the girl 's family , whether it be ' necklaces , cows , goats , whatever the family agrees on , ' said @entity92			0
@entity9 , the prosecutor , said the family of the girl has refused to co-operate with her in her investigation			0
she said she would not seek to arrest the father of the newborn without speaking with @entity8 leaders			1
@entity2 constitutional law experts say such cases are always very complicated			0
former @entity127 magistrate @entity126 said that ' what the @entity128 ca n't do is submit a defendant to degrading treatment or the death penalty			0
' the world 's youngest mother in a medically documented case was @entity136 of @entity137 , who in 1939 produced an infant at the age of five years , eight months , according to the @entity140 .			1

young mother gave birth to daughter two weeks *ago*
she is in @entity8 tribe which has own justice system
they refuse to help in under - age sex investigation
