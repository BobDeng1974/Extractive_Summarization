by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 12:01 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 23 december 2012 pay freeze : nurses have seen a real terms pay cut while executives have enjoyed a two per cent rise @entity8 executives have enjoyed a two per cent pay rise over the past year - even though nurses are suffering a pay freeze			1
official statistics show that senior managers , such as finance directors and human resource officers , now earn an average of £ 74,654			1
this is up £ 1,459 from the average figure last september			2
the pay rises for bureaucrats come despite the fact that nurses have been suffering a two - year pay freeze since march last year			2
nurses start at £ 21,000 a year and their average salary is just over £ 30,000			1
the pay freeze means that , in real terms , their pay has been cut - because of the rising cost of living			1
separate figures , released following a parliamentary question , indicate that more nursing staff have lost their jobs since the election than managers			1
in august of this year , there were 4,544 fewer bureaucrats working in the @entity8 than there were in august 2010 - many of them walking off with six - figure pay - offs			2
but over the same period , the number of qualified nurses , midwives and health visitors plummeted by 4,573			0
it means that 29 more frontline nursing staff lost their jobs than administrators during the two year period			1
and , to make matters worse , no fewer than 1,341 of the departing managers received redundancy pay - outs of more than £ 100,000			1
the total includes 173 who were paid more than £ 200,000 when the organisations for which they worked were abolished			0
in total , almost £ 1billion has been paid in redundancy packages to managers since the election			2
@entity59 , of campaign group @entity60 , said of the pay figures : ‘ this is yet another hammer blow to the morale of our nurses			1
‘ frontline staff are now working longer hours under extraordinary pressures for no extra pay			2
despite that , it is a small band of well - paid execs who are being rewarded with higher wages			0
’ dr @entity73 , chief executive of the @entity74 , said : ‘ nursing staff are already being stretched to breaking point because of staffing cuts , and on top of that they are seeing their pay being cut in real terms			1
‘ chief executives enjoying a significant increase in pay sends completely the wrong message to hard working frontline staff			2
’ @entity86 , @entity87 's health spokesman , said @entity88 is allowing frontline staff to ' take a battering ' earlier this month a damning report by the @entity92 found that many trusts were failing to meet quality standards because they employed too few nursing staff			1
@entity97 , of the @entity98 ’ @entity96 , said : ‘ the @entity8 needs nurses treating the sick not back - room form fillers			2
‘ this is yet further evidence that hospital bosses are managing their budgets poorly			0
they should be protecting the front line while cutting back the bloated bureaucracy			0
‘ there are necessary savings to be made but it appears @entity8 management are incapable of taking the right decisions for taxpayers and patients			0
’ @entity87 ’s health spokesman @entity86 , who obtained the figures on staffing levels , said the true position was much worse			0
he said that once health visitors and midwives are taken out of the picture , the number of nurses has fallen by around 7,000 since the election			0
‘ the prime minister ’s boasts about cutting @entity8 bureaucracy have come to nothing , ’ he said			0
‘ instead , he ’s quietly axed the jobs of thousands more nurses than managers			1
‘ @entity88 is allowing the front - line of the @entity8 to take a battering as he cuts the budget			0
he has wasted £ 3bn on a re-organisation of the @entity8 back - office that is adding fresh layers of bureaucracy and damaging patient care			0
‘ as the @entity8 haemorrhages nursing staff patients will pay the price of @entity88 ’s false promises			1
ministers are taking unacceptable risks with standards of patient care			0
they can not continue to ignore the warnings from nurses ’ and doctors ’ leaders			0

statistics show senior managers now earn an average of almost £ *75,000*
but nurses have taken a real term pay cut because of rising cost of living
@entity74 : ‘ staff are being stretched to breaking point '
figures also show more nursing staff have lost their jobs than managers
