by @entity0 published : 13:39 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 25 january 2013 it is an age - old saying that is regularly contested by brunettes all over the world			0
but it seems blondes do indeed have more fun			0
so much more , in fact , that their careers are now suffering			0
@entity10 's leading facial mapping team has revealed just how important looks are when it comes to success in the workplace , and it seems having fair hair does n't actually fare all that well			1
blondes have too much fun : fair - haired ladies such as @entity20 , left , and @entity21 , right , are less likely to succeed at work , according to the new study @entity25 success : women with straight dark hair like @entity28 , left , and @entity29 , right , are destined for more success in the workplace , according to new research the research team , led by the @entity10 's leading facial mapping expert dr @entity35 , was tasked with analysing the facial features we associate with success and leadership in the workplace , and the results found that those with straight dark hair are considered most likely to succeed			1
respondents ranked faces in terms of perceived business acumen and leadership qualities , taking into account a range of facial features such as the shape , size and position of the head , eyes , lips and overall symmetry			2
the findings revealed that the shape of the male jaw line is a key metric when it comes to perceived leadership qualities ; indeed we associate ' hyper ' leaders with having a very strong jaw line			2
conversely , faces which get narrower towards the jaw line were perceived as weaker and less credible			0
face for success : the research found that @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right , have a perfect face for success interestingly , @entity75 and @entity76 were cited as business leaders who fit the leader profile , and @entity71 and @entity72 most closely match the ' leadership at work ' prototypes			1
future leadership hopeful and current @entity84 @entity83 scored lower for his down - turned eyes and fleshy jawline			0
for @entity83 , however , the face for success is not too far out of reach			0
based on average @entity10 plastic surgery prices , the @entity91 mayor would need to spend £ 11,847 on plastic surgery to fit the hyper - leader model			1
@entity95 , meanwhile , may want to consider removing the dark rings under his eyes which are associated with unsuccessful people in the workplace			2
but @entity95 's facial - altering work might be a little more costly : experts estimate that he would have to part with £ 13,869 , which would include rhinoplasty surgery ( nose shaping ) , a chin implant , eye lid bag removal surgery and a brow lift to improve his physical hyper - leader qualities			1
work needed : it seems that @entity95 , left , and @entity83 , right , need some extra work done if they want to progress in their political career @entity117 , general manager of tv channel @entity116 who commissioned the research , said : ' we all know that first impressions count but this is the first time that a study has actually delved into the facial traits that help us make those decisions			1
' the results are fascinating and make for depressing reading for the likes of @entity95 and @entity83 who may want to consider a little cosmetic work before their next election campaigns			2
’ the study was carried out to celebrate the start of the second series of suits , on @entity116 , thursdays 9pm			0

certain facial traits are associated with success and leadership
those with straight dark hair most likely to succeed
@entity71 and @entity72 have most successful ' political faces '
@entity95 should spend £ 13,869 on plastic surgery to improve success
