it was a run that ended on a high with the @entity2 won in @entity3 against @entity4 but in the end @entity6 stopped just short of setting a new world record for consecutive wins			1
after 22 straight victories they fell just short of @entity11 – the @entity13 side who currently hold the @entity16 world record for 24 wins – and the @entity19 team that strung together 26 straight wins in the 1971 - 72 season ( losing only one friendly match on the run )			1
they were given a guard of honour on to the pitch at the start of the @entity29 game			0
the gesture was for their @entity2 success but it could easily have been for the longest winning streak in @entity34 football history			1
@entity35 was helpless as @entity6 's 22 - match winning run came to an end at @entity29 @entity6 were given a guard of honour before the game for winning the @entity2 last month but @entity42 ( left ) and his team - mates were left trudging off after a 2 - 1 defeat at the @entity45 played 22 won 22 goals 81 left foot 20 right foot 42 header 16 own goals 2 other 1 inside box 72 outside box 9 when they beat @entity48 4 - 0 in their last @entity50 group game they set a new @entity34 record of 19 wins , beating the 18 - game run of @entity56 ’s @entity55 side in the 2005 - 06 season			1
@entity19 and @entity11 might have remained a step too far but @entity59 and his coaching staff may breathe a sigh of relief that the loss has come now and not as they build up steam in their bid to win the treble this season			2
@entity29 in @entity45 was always going to be a tough first game back after the winter break and finally the tank ran dry			0
even if they had beaten @entity74 ’s @entity29 team it still would have been tough to keep winning with a two - legged tie against @entity76 in the @entity77 still standing between them and the record			2
two wins over an @entity76 side boosted by the return of @entity83 , and wins over @entity85 and @entity86 would have seen them set a new record but it has still been an incredible journey and one that started after consecutive defeats to @entity90 and @entity76 earlier in the season			1
@entity6 lifted the @entity2 in @entity92 after beating @entity94 side @entity4 in the final @entity35 netted 28 times during the run - enough usually to win the @entity97 @entity98 celebrates after scoring the winner in the home @entity50 tie with @entity102 @entity35 punches the air in delight after opening the scoring at @entity106 in @entity6 's 3 - 0 win @entity6 's 22 - match run has left them a point clear at the top of the @entity112 table 28 - @entity35 13 - @entity98 10 - @entity42 8 - @entity113 4 - @entity114 , @entity115 3 - @entity116 2 - @entity117 , @entity119 goals 1 - @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 back then there were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in , and whether the side could cope with the loss of @entity132 and @entity133			1
' i think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a @entity2 on an @entity141 tour where we only had 10 senior players , ' reflected @entity59 ’s assistant coach @entity144			1
the first win of the run came on september 16 at home in the @entity50 when @entity148 were on the wrong end of a 5 - 1 hammering			2
@entity6 then put eight past @entity151 and five more past @entity152			2
suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it was n’t all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either			0
they went to @entity158 and won 2 - 0 and they then went to @entity159 and saw off @entity48 2 - 1			0
then came the reat test – @entity102 , @entity55 and @entity102 again in the space of just two weeks			0
they made it look easy			0
@entity113 ( left ) celebrates with @entity115 and his team - mates during @entity6 's win over @entity55 the winning run has been inspired by @entity6 coach @entity59 @entity35 poses with the 2014 @entity168 's favourite player award in @entity169 ' going to @entity106 is always difficult because of that atmosphere , ' said @entity144			1
' it ’s like another player for them			0
but we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes			0
we got the goal and calmed the crowd			0
' @entity6 ran out 3 - 0 winners and former @entity178 forward @entity35 was even applauded off by the @entity179 when substituted			1
@entity55 turned up the @entity180 in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal			0
they scored first with debutant @entity183 setting up @entity184			0
but @entity6 were too strong and ran out 3 - 1 winners			2
after wins over @entity187 and @entity188 , @entity102 visited the @entity189 with a drastically changed team from the first leg but @entity6 still won 1 - 0			1
with three mighty scalps under their belts the @entity6 steamroller went on flattening the opposition until the end of 2014			2
they scored 81 goals on the 22 - match run with @entity35 netting 28 of those – a stunning tally sufficient to win league top scorer in most seasons			1
@entity35 celebrates scoring against @entity29 on sunday but it was in a losing cause @entity42 fires off a shot during @entity6 's friendly in @entity169 against @entity205 last week @entity35 jumps to head clear a @entity102 corner during @entity6 's comfortable 3 - 0 win at @entity106 the other two - thirds of the @entity209 front three – @entity42 and @entity98 – also made it into double figures			1
and only four times on the run did they not have the majority of possession			0
‘ will you be affected by the defeat ? ’ @entity59 was asked after the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity29			0
‘ after winning 22 straight games , i do n’t think so , ’ he replied			0
@entity6 fans were also buoyed by @entity55 ’s defeat to @entity90 coming on the same day			2
front pages in the capital that reflected on the end of the run also ran with ‘ @entity228 shoots himself in the foot ’ headlines			0
the winning streak has been worthy of @entity34 and @entity232 champions – now @entity6 have to go on and bag both those trophies to ensure that after such a wonder mid-season procession of victories they also get a victory parade at the end of the campaign			1
