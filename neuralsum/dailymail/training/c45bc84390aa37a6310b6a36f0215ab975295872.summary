compensation claim : @entity2 @entity1 , 34 , won just under £ 5,000 compensation from her employers at @entity5 a policewoman has won her fight for compensation after cutting her thumb while dismantling a cannabis plant - leaving the taxpayer with a £ 150,000 legal bill			1
@entity2 @entity1 , a @entity12 police officer , will receive £ 4,837 damages after her employers today lost a bid to overturn an earlier decision in the @entity16			1
the @entity17 , 34 , was nauseous from cannabis fumes when she cut her thumb on broken glass while uprooting plants at a flat in @entity23 , @entity24 , following a drugs bust			2
the serving officer sued her chief constable claiming the force had breached their duty of care by allowing her to be exposed to the fumes and failing to provide thick gardening gloves			1
the court heard @entity36 's task was to uproot plants and dump them in a skip outside			0
her superiors thought that the only risk to her was skin irritation from contact with cannabis leaves and issued her with thin latex gloves			0
her head swimming due to the effects of cannabis fumes , she tried to open a window , forgetting it had been sealed , and pushed her hand through a glass pane , suffering a cut to her right thumb			2
at @entity56 last year , judge @entity55 upheld @entity36 's damages claim , ruling that the force had breached the duty it owed her under the @entity60			0
the force challenged that decision , insisting that it had done all it was obliged to do to protect @entity36 and that , had she confined herself to pulling up plants , she would never have been at any risk from sharp edges			0
attacking judge @entity69 's ruling as setting an unrealistically high standard , the chief constable argued it was ' absurd ' to expect the force to allocate a specific task to each officer involved in the operation and to carry out individual risk assessments			1
however , dismissing the force 's appeal , @entity77 said the duty on employers was a tough one and the risk to @entity36 , however slight , could have been avoided by the simple means of issuing her with heavy - duty gloves			2
drugs bust : @entity2 @entity1 was removing cannabis plants from a property in @entity24 , @entity12 , when she cut her thumb sitting with @entity92 , he said @entity36 would have been exposed to a ' whole range ' of risks while clearing the cannabis farm in september 2008 and ruled that the force had breached its legal duty to protect her			1
there was , the court ruled , also ' no injustice ' in ordering the force to pay @entity36 's legal costs bills			2
her barrister , @entity103 , earlier told the court : ' the whole place was a nest of wires			0
all these risks were magnified given that there was little ventilation and a nauseating atmosphere hazardous to health			0
' force solicitor @entity113 said that the taxpayer would only have to pay the first £ 100,000 worth of legal bills as they have insurance to cover the rest			1
' we have always taken a firm position that we will defend claims where the specialist advice received is that the claimant is not legally entitled to compensation from the constabulary			0
we were advised by experienced counsel that we had a strong case for appeal and took the action we felt appropriate			2
' however , on this occasion the court found against us			0
costs of more than £ 100,000 were incurred by the claimant at the first hearing			1
' we pay the first £ 100,000 of any action , and insurance covers any remittance above this , which in this case includes the cost of the appeal and our external legal fees			1
' in light of the decision , will look again at the decision making process for appeals , as we are conscious at all times that we have a duty to make the very best use of public money , and this requires that claims that the constabulary is advised are without merit are defended and others resolved			0
