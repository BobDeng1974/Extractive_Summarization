by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 17 july 2013 an author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology and know - how to survive the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs 250 million years ago			1
@entity8 claims in her new book , @entity10 , adapt , and remember : how humans will survive a @entity12 , that we are now capable of spotting if a deadly asteroid is heading towards @entity15 , for example , and have the technology needed to survive in space if need be			1
she adds that her theory was inspired by the @entity20 - a pig - lizard dinosaur that survived the @entity22 by hiding in underground burrows and later adapted to the new environments it found itself in			1
an author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology to ensure our survival for the next million years			1
she claims we will be thriving on a futuristic version of our planet , similar to the one depicted in this artist 's impression , or be living in space @entity20 , which is @entity36 for shovel lizard lived around 250 million years ago in what is now @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			1
up to six species are thought to still exist @entity20 was the most common dinosaur of the @entity44 period			1
it was previously thought it had features which enabled it to adapt better than other animals at the time to survive the the mass extinction , called the @entity22 , which was caused by a drop in oxygen levels			1
more recent theories claim it was able to survive by hiding in underground burrows			1
@entity20 was a heavily built plant eater roughly the size of a pig			1
the forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs , and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that would have helped it create these burrows			2
@entity8 's book also discounts the theories that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and survive in a virtual world			2
speaking to @entity71 , @entity8 said : ' i was learning about the survivors of the @entity22			1
it was the worst mass extinction in @entity15 's history , caused by disastrous climate changes in the wake of a super volcano			2
' and yet a humble little creature called @entity20 managed to survive this horrific period			2
pretty much every other animal on land went extinct			2
' i figured that if this little pig - lizard could do it , so could we			2
' she continues that the human race has a history of being able to survive environmental changes are we have proved how good we are at adapting to change			2
according to @entity8 , this has been helped by technological developments : ' if an asteroid were headed for @entity15 right now , we 'd almost certainly see it coming several years out			1
' we have space - based telescopes that are monitoring over 90 per cent of the nearby rocks that could hit us , and astronomers are constantly looking for more			2
' all it would take are a few space probes of the kind we already have to go out into space , meet one of those asteroids , and just push it out of an intercept course with @entity15			2
journalist @entity8 believes we now have the know - how to prevent the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs			1
her theory was inspired by the @entity20 , pictured , which managed to endure the @entity22 by hiding underground and adapting to the new climate this artist 's impression shows an asteroid striking @entity15			1
newitz believes we now have the technology to predict and prevent such an event from happening ' we also have the technology to build carbon - neutral cities and even carbon - neutral factories			1
' it was surprising to me to realise how much of our planet 's future really is in the hands of humanity			1
' we do n't need to wait for a miracle , or for a new scientific discovery			2
we just need to implement the knowledge and tools we already have			0
we can do it ! ' newitz is a strong advocate for exploring more of space and potentially setting up colonies on other planets using ' space elevators ' to reach new planets			0
this is becoming closer to reality through projects such as the @entity139 rocket engine which was recently funded by the @entity140			0
this engine can travel up to five times the speed of sound and could quickly and cheaply transport people into space in the near future			0
in her book , @entity8 uses this theory to discount those made by futurists such as @entity151 's @entity150			1
this artist 's impression shows a @entity139 rocket engine fitted to the @entity156 spaceplane			0
newitz claims developments in space technology , such as this , could help the human race set up colonies on other planets in her book , @entity8 believes the human race will survive by more actively exploring space @entity150 believes that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			1
the director of engineering at @entity151 also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			1
@entity8 responded to this by telling @entity71 : ' the most implausible ideas i encountered [ while writing the book ] were all about what humans would do in the long term instead of going into outer space			0
' @entity186 has a long history of exploring , starting a million years ago when our ancestors first left @entity41			1
' we are a species of tool - makers and explorers , and we 're damn good at it			0
so i find it extremely unlikely that we would give up on exploring space			0
' i think it 's even more unlikely that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and live in virtual worlds instead of what we know as the physical world			0
' i 'm sure some people will do that , maybe temporarily while traveling through space , but just staying here on @entity15 when there are so many other awesome places to go ? i found myself unable to accept it			0
' when questioned about whether humans deserve to survive , @entity8 said : ' whether or not we deserve to persist is n't really relevant to whether we will do it			0
' we have all the traits of a survival species , just like @entity20			0
humans are life forms , and life forms always fight to survive , no matter what			0
it 's in our most fundamental , biological natures			0
' so we 'd better accept that , and work on making the future as comfortable as possible			0
' as human animals , we have evolved the ability to plan a better future for ourselves			0
we can even stop a mass extinction			0
we do n't have to be angels to preserve our ecosystems			0
we just have to be practical , and not waste our time wondering whether we are good enough to deserve it			0
' @entity150 , pictured , said that ' frail , biological parts ' of human bodies will be replaced with ' non-biological ' parts in the future			0
a theory that has been discounted by @entity8			1

author claims we already have the technology to prepare for disasters
she believes we *'ll* be thriving on this planet , or another , in a million years
her theory is inspired by a dinosaur that survived the @entity22
