by @entity0 her sculptures may be wooden , but artist @entity4 's creations are anything but lifeless as these beautifully detailed pictures show			1
from a cyclist with veins standing out on his arms , to a face contorted in fear , @entity4 , who is also a professor of philosophy , hand carves each figure when she is not busy in the classroom			1
while a basic design can take just a few days to complete , more detailed work can take anything up to a month and a half to finish			0
sculptor @entity19 takes anywhere between a few days and a month and a half to create wonderfully detailed wooden designs such as this one , called @entity24 made from two pieces of basswood , one for the body , head and crown , and another for the hands , @entity24 was displayed in the windows of @entity32 on @entity33 , @entity34 the figure , which was completed in february 2008 , was inspired by exhibits in the @entity37 in @entity38 , and the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 this piece , @entity43 , was finished in august 2010 and designed as a counterpart to @entity24			1
the figure is also made from basswood , and her crown is made from many pieces slotted together her work has been exhibited all over the world , and a statue of @entity54 she designed will take pride of place in @entity58 in @entity59 after it is unveiled in october			0
the brass figure beat 265 other entries from 42 and 13 countries to win the commission , and is designed to look as if @entity54 has just stepped off the train to visit his parents			0
her sculptures have also been displayed in the @entity67 , the windows of @entity69 's on 5th avenue , and in the @entity71 , on the @entity72			2
@entity4 can spend up to 1,000 hours getting the details of a sculpture just right , such as the delicate floral designs which run down @entity43 's sleeves and the garlands around her neck the @entity80 sculpture was created from two pieces of wood in 2005 and was one piece in a three - part commission called @entity85 , which included a runner and a swimmer the arms on the rider show the level of detail that goes into @entity4 's work , with his veins , sinewy muscle and wristwatch all painstakingly carved out @entity4 was artistic from a young age , training as a painter , before travelling to @entity99 in 1987 where she was inspired by the likes of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 and turned to sculpture instead			1
while she intended to become a stone sculptor , she started working in wood first as her mother used to refurbish wood furniture , her father was a carpenter , and her grandfather had a wood shop in his ship yard			0
she always intended to start using stone , but fell in love ' the warmth and unpredictability of the wood , ' and never went back			0
the swimmer was part of the same commission			0
speaking about the work , @entity4 said she was interested in capturing people in motion , as she found posed characters uninteresting the swimmer was carved from a single piece of wood and formed part of a three - part collection , which included the rider			1
the third part , @entity131 , was a huge runner 's leg , also made from basswood @entity4 says her art is deliberately simple to understand , and aims to be visually rich and detailed rather than intellectually complex or conceptual steering away from modern ' conceptual ' art which @entity4 says is often overly - complex , she aims to create figures which are ' immediate and obvious ; ideally , they do not need a theory to do their talking			2
' one of her commissions , @entity85 , featured three figures including a bike rider , a swimmer and a giant runner 's leg to represent the three stages of a race			0
at the time she was creating the work , @entity4 said she preferred creating figures in motion as she found ' posed ' figures uninteresting			2
@entity4 says she was inspired by stone masters such a @entity101 and @entity155 but chose to work in wood as her father was a carpenter and her mother used to repair wooden furniture @entity159 also uses her talents to capture human emotions in wooden sculptures			1
this piece is simply called @entity164 and captures a wide - eyed woman with her head thrown back in fear this work , called @entity169 , captures a woman 's fear and frustration which keep her awake			2

@entity4 is professor of philosophy at a @entity34 college
but in her spare time she hand - carves amazing wooden sculptures
works take up to 1,000 hours and have appeared in @entity32 on @entity33
