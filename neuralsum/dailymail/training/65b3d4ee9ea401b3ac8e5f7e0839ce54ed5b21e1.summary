by @entity1 reporter published : 20:10 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 31 march 2013 costly change : a move to ban councils from putting street lights on electricity poles could cost town halls ' millions of pounds ' villages and towns across the country face reductions in street lighting because of a health and safety ruling			1
for years , councils have fixed street lights to poles belonging to electricity firms , saving money and reducing street clutter			1
phone companies used them too , combining three services in one pole			0
however , the practice is under threat following the death of a @entity26 engineer who was electrocuted while working on an electricity network pole			1
councils may have to erect their own poles for street lights , at a cost of around £ 1,000 each			1
parish and town councils are saying they just do n’t have the money , so street lights will have to be turned off instead			1
the @entity36 is seeking urgent talks with the government over the policy which it estimates will cost authorities ' millions of pounds			1
' a spokesman said : ' @entity43 is extremely worried about the situation which arisen from this policy			0
' the cost to local councils to maintain existing lighting with new types of poles is going to be disproportionate to the overall budgets of these councils			1
' we know that in a small rural parish council in @entity56 that the costs could amount to £ 65,000 ; which is greater than its total annual budget			0
' there is a risk that in some areas of the country there will be darkness which then is a risk to the vulnerable in our society and this is not right			0
' @entity68 of the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) said : ' it ’s daft really			0
what we do n’t want is more infrastructure such as ' street furniture ' being put up			2
' there is no point having three poles next to each other , each carrying one service , when one pole will do			2
' surely people can be trained in the necessary safety procedures and the electricity , local authorities and communications services can collaborate with each other			2
that is the sensible option			0
' catalyst : the policy follows the death of a @entity26 engineer the ban on hosting street lights was revealed by @entity94 's chief executive , @entity93			1
he says other companies are taking the same action			0
mr @entity93 says other electricity companies across the @entity98 are taking the same action			2
street lights are thought to deter crime and there are fears the move could lead to an upsurge in muggings , thefts and burglaries			1
the move has horrified the parish of @entity109 in @entity56 , which has just 1,724 residents and about 40 lamps fitted to electricity poles			1
the council estimates it would cost £ 40,000 to replace them , twice its total annual expenditure			0
councillor @entity116 said : ' the government is doing nothing at all to help			2
there is just no money to do this work and we will have to turn off all lights affected in this way if nothing is done to help			2
' she said town and parish councils would be saddled with massive debt due to the change in health and safety policy			0
' i appreciate that it is very sad that someone died after climbing an electric wire pole , ' she said			0
blackout : the ban on hosting street lights was revealed by @entity94 's chief executive , @entity93			1
he says other companies are taking the same action ' however , we do n’t have chapter and verse as to the exact circumstances and it seems to me that the key issue is training			0
' we do n’t close all roads , or stop people driving on them because of one single accident			0
the response has surely to be proportionate			0
' a spokesman for @entity94 said councils were alerted of this safety requirement two years ago to allow time to plan for the change			1
' we have not sought to remove all such equipment immediately , rather we have phased the work over several years as part of our routine refurbishment work on electricity poles			1
' we will continue to give councils six months notice when we will be removing the lighting from our poles			2
' @entity169 of @entity170 said : ' there is no obligation within the standard for a network provider to allow any attachments from third parties on their equipment , and each network operator will make decisions based on their own risk assessment			0
