as @entity1 continues to be the @entity3 's focal point for international tourism , @entity0 is hoping it can provide a viable alternative to what the capital can offer			1
mps on the @entity9 and sport select committee are discussing how , and by what means , @entity3 tourism can be shifted so as regions and the north in particular can benefit from increased footfall			1
since the @entity17 came to @entity0 , feelings are growing in the county that it can be a realistic competitor to @entity1 tourism			1
the @entity21 of @entity22 , @entity0 's answer to @entity24 the @entity17 trekking through @entity0 brought a worldwide focus on the county ' i think it 's fair to say that following our historic hosting of the @entity17 , @entity0 's global profile is at an all - time high , ' @entity27 , chief executive of welcome to @entity0 told @entity34			2
' @entity17 gave us the chance to showcase the county on tv screens in 190 countries and it looked magnificent			2
it 's all about getting @entity0 front of mind , and it 's working			0
@entity44 , @entity45 – world ’s only submarium @entity47 , @entity48 – in top three most visited paid - for attractions @entity0 – attracts more than 3.5m people per year @entity51 – largest gothic cathedral in northern @entity53 @entity54 – one of @entity53 ’s most famous and synonymous with @entity56 the @entity57 – biggest new art space outside of @entity1 @entity22 , @entity59 – royal household where @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 officially started the @entity17 @entity64 , @entity65 – one of fastest growing attractions in @entity68 five national museums – @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ! three national parks – @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 home of @entity80 , @entity81 – huge draw for international visitors @entity45 – won the @entity84 title @entity86 – world ’s first ever @entity87 @entity51 – just this month been named a @entity89 ' our county is now a real alternative for international visitors compared to staples such as @entity1 and @entity94			1
@entity0 is fast becoming that third dot on the @entity3 tourism map , roughly halfway between the capital and @entity94			1
' @entity100 's @entity99 2014 stats show @entity0 enjoyed its best first half of year for international tourism since 2008			1
and 2013 was also a brilliant year for us , with a record 35 per cent rise in spend			0
' @entity104 , @entity105 and several other leading guides all included our county in the top 10 places to visit globally for 2014			0
perhaps widely known for the @entity76 , @entity110 and @entity0 puddings , you probably did n't know that the county has four @entity87 sites ; @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 in @entity86 as well as @entity51 being named the @entity89 , and @entity86 credited with the title of @entity118			1
and for @entity1 having the @entity119 and @entity24 , @entity0 has @entity22 , the @entity21 where @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 officially started the @entity17			0
for @entity121 in the @entity122 , there 's the @entity51 , the largest gothic cathedral in northern @entity53			0
and for the @entity123 how about upgrading to @entity44 in @entity45 , the world 's only ' submarium ' mr @entity27 added : ' international visitors like our real seasons and changing scenery all year round , which makes @entity0 an appealing proposition 365 days a year			0
' we have more listed buildings than there are chateaux in @entity133 , five national museums , three national parks , a stunning coastline and four @entity87 sites – and that 's just a taste of what @entity0 has to offer			1
it 's a compelling mix , in easy reach of the capital and by international standards everything is close together			0
the @entity51 is a popular tourist destination and is the largest gothic cathedral in northern @entity53 @entity121 , @entity1 ; but can the @entity51 be the northern equivalent ? officials in @entity0 believe they are in pole position to attract global tourists to the county ' we 've always said tourism is a powerhouse sector and welcome to @entity0 will continue to build on these solid foundations and also lobby @entity157 for support to promote the county around the world to help grow the economy and create jobs for years to come			0
' but with almost 90 per cent of tourism outside of @entity1 restricted to persons from within the @entity3 , the fear remains that any moves to facilitate worldwide tourism could impact domestically			2
this led to leading tourist organisations in the @entity3 , @entity3 destinations , to voice their concerns with exactly how the government propose to implement a spread of tourism			2
@entity44 in @entity45 is the world 's biggest ' submarium ' attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors every year @entity54 at the @entity77 has been preserved to incredible lengths the @entity76 ' beauty stretches for miles and gives a unique look into @entity0 life @entity184 , ceo of @entity3 destinations told @entity34 : ' while we are obviously all for international tourism spreading throughout the @entity3 , it was important to question the value of distributing tourists where there is limited resource			1
' you 've got to ask , why would n't tourists go to @entity1 ? there 's everything there and it is an established destination that has the resources to cater for increasing demands of tourism			0
' it is n't simply a question of inviting people to travel to other areas of the @entity3 , we 've got to see what attracts them to @entity1 in the first place , and then see how other places can provide for their needs			0

@entity210 are looking into how international tourism can be dispersed in @entity3
following @entity17 , @entity213 believes it has a proven attraction
@entity216 has four @entity87 sites , and *reported* increased tourism spend
