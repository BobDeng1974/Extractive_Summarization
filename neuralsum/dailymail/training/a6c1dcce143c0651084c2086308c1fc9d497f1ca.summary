nine people who illegally named a woman raped by a footballer were told to pay her just £ 624 each in compensation yesterday			1
the nine , who included a woman teacher , posted messages on @entity7 and @entity8 accusing the 19 year old of being a ‘ money - grabbing slut ’ who had made up the attack			1
some are on benefits and will be able to pay the debt off at £ 6 a week – denying the teenager full compensation for two years			0
last night the former @entity19 mp who reported the internet bullies to police said the judge ’s lenient sentence ‘ sickened her ’			0
fined but not jailed : @entity25 , 25 , left , arrives at @entity26 , where he and @entity27 , 26 , right , were fined for naming a woman raped by footballer @entity29 @entity26 appearance : @entity31 , 18 , left , and @entity32 , 21 , right , were among the nine condemned for making comments on social networking sites ‘ a teenage rape victim was insulted , demeaned and named – and the perpetrators get fined just a few hundred quid			1
the law must change to protect victims , ’ said @entity35			1
@entity41 from @entity42 said : ‘ the fine is outrageous			1
the law , which protects the anonymity of rape victims , needs to be adequately applied			1
‘ if somebody breaks the law they should go to jail – and not be given paltry fines			1
someone senior needs to have a word with that judge			0
’ arrested : @entity53 , 23 , was one of the nine held and later convicted over the naming of the victim the teenager is said to have been traumatised by the heated online discussion after @entity29 was convicted in april of raping her the previous may			1
the nine posted the messages about her with ‘ deliberate malice ’ after the 23 - year - old @entity62 and @entity64 striker was jailed for five years for the hotel room assault			1
the defendants appeared at @entity26 in @entity67 charged with publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case			2
they claimed not to know that identifying a rape victim was a criminal offence			1
policing the internet is proving a challenge for constabularies and the case involving such a large group is believed to be unprecedented			0
the offence – in a case which went to the attorney general for consent before charges were laid – carried a maximum fine of £ 5,000			1
district judge @entity86 rejected other sentencing options in favour of ordering the payment of compensation			0
technically , this means the nine – including a biology teacher , a cousin of the player and football supporters – were not even fined			0
‘ rape is a taboo in every civilised society , ’ said the judge			2
‘ it is viewed in this way because it is a crime against women which subjects them to the most intimate personal violation			0
‘ for reasons which i had thought were within the common knowledge of most intelligent people in this country we offer further protection for the victims of rape by prohibiting the publication of their names and personal details			2
’ but @entity118 , a lawyer , said : ‘ no fine can put back into the box the fact that the victim has been identified			1
’ guilty : @entity123 , 27 , left , and @entity124 , 26 , right , were among the group who passed round comments such as ' money grabbing whore ' about the victim shamed : @entity130 , 22 , covers his face outside court , left , while @entity133 , 25 , right , faced obscured by umbrella , is also publicity shy he said the case sent a ‘ public health warning ’ to all those who use social media and treat it ‘ as a conversation ’ when it has a ‘ far greater ability to spread virally and cause serious harm ’			1
last night campaigner @entity145 , who was the victim of the @entity147 rape in 1986 , said the punishment should have been stiffer			1
convicted : footballer @entity29 was found guilty of rape in april and today nine people admitted revealing the name of the victim online ‘ i do n’t think it ’s enough , ’ she said			1
‘ it ’s very difficult for victims to come forward when you are dealing with celebrity cases			0
‘ questions are raised about your integrity and people will slag you off because you have made a claim against someone who is famous			0
‘ sentences need to be a lot stiffer than they currently are			0
it is not much of a deterrent			0
’ the judge told the offenders they had identified the victim , some with abusive comments and others with ‘ deliberate malice ’			2
he added : ‘ you did so without proper knowledge of the facts and without any heed of the feelings of the victim			2
‘ your actions have revictimised this woman again			0
it is not for you to take the law into your own hands as you did			2
in my view you best atone for what you have done by paying compensation			0
’ he ordered them to pay a total of £ 5,616 in compensation as their only punishment			0
@entity193 , prosecuting , told the court the case attracted a huge amount of interest nationally and internationally and there were 6,000 mentions on @entity7			0
she said @entity199 received numerous complaints from members of the public and from groups such as @entity42 about the victim ’s treatment online			2
@entity133 , 26 , a college biology teacher from @entity206 , retweeted a comment calling the victim a ‘ money - grabbing slut ’			1
@entity133 later told police that she had been an idiot and wanted to apologise to the victim			2
admission : the nine said they did n't realise what they had done was a crime , @entity26 heard star : @entity29 was an established striker with @entity64 ( pictured scoring against @entity219 ) - and some of the people involved in naming the rape victim were @entity223 fans @entity31 , 18 , a pub worker and cousin of @entity29 from @entity225 , described the victim as a ‘ money - grabbing little tramp ’ and ‘ dirty slapper ’			1
the maximum penalty for revealing the identity of a rape victim is just a fine			1
but other social media users who have broken different laws online have gone to jail			0
after the footballer @entity238 collapsed on the pitch from a heart attack during a @entity242 match , student @entity237 , 21 , was sent to prison for inciting racial hatred over abusive texts			0
he was sentenced to 56 days in prison			0
@entity53 , 23 , also from the player ’s home town , named the victim on @entity8 in what he accepted was ‘ an act of utter stupidity ’			1
jobless @entity27 , from @entity253 , wrote on @entity8 : ‘ she ’s to blame for her downfall			0
let ’s find her address			0
’ his lawyer said the 26 year old had no intention of doing so and deleted the post four hours later			0
jobless @entity123 , a 27 year old from @entity225 who was a friend of the footballer , made an abusive comment on @entity7			0
@entity32 , 21 , of @entity265 , @entity266 , tweeted she had ‘ cried rape ’ and she ‘ made him sick ’			2
he removed the post after his law student girlfriend told him it was illegal			2
@entity130 , a 22 - year - old hotel receptionist and football fan from @entity253 , suggested on @entity7 the victim had ‘ cried rape before ’			1
he later told police he was ‘ devastated ’ that @entity64 had lost @entity29 as a result of the trial because he was the team ’s best player			1
another fan @entity25 , 25 and from @entity253 , told police he was drunk when he insulted the victim on @entity7			2
and jobless @entity124 , 26 , from @entity206 , tweeted the woman was a ‘ money - grabbing slut ’ .			1

as well as naming @entity29 *'s* rape victim , they also posted vile abuse - calling her a ' money grabbing whore ' and a ' poor little victim '
under @entity294 law no victim of rape or sexual assaults can be named but the maximum penalty is just a fine
some of the nine did not name her themselves , but ' retweeted ' her identity , which was still enough to be convicted
