a washed up former professional footballer who masqueraded as a @entity2 star to maintain his celebrity life of champagne and shopping sprees is facing a ' substantial ' stretch in jail for fraud today			0
@entity9 , 24 , who once earned £ 4,000 a week and was tipped for stardom , was so ashamed at his career at top flight clubs floundering due to injury he falsely claimed to be multi-millionaire @entity15 midfielder @entity14 to get drink and clothes on credit			1
during one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £ 25,000 bar tab on @entity4 in one @entity23 in @entity24 claiming ' he was a @entity2 star and good for the money '			1
he also ran up a £ 9,600 bill at three @entity24 luxury hotels , took a bar in @entity30 for another £ 5,000 , scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £ 11,000 on limousines saying he had an @entity35 credit card			1
he claimed his one - time massive weekly wage left him with a ' wholly unrealistic ' understanding of money			0
today at @entity57 , @entity9 , of @entity58 , @entity24 , admitted three charges of fraud , taking a @entity61 without consent and making off without paying for £ 104 worth of petrol			1
nearly all the offences involved him making false representations that he was @entity14			2
he was also appearing for sentence for five other counts of similar frauds in @entity24 and @entity69 in which he claimed to be the former @entity15 star			1
he asked for 19 other offences to be considered			0
judge @entity72 agreed to an adjournment until later this month for the preparation of background reports but said : ' how will a pre-sentence report assist me in a case which will inevitably be a substantial prison sentence ? i 'm not planning a non-custodial sentence			0
' @entity9 , was born in the @entity80 and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of @entity84 and @entity85 , before moving to @entity86 where he was paid £ 1,000 a week at just 16 years old			1
he attracted attention from several @entity2 clubs early in his career and was given trials at @entity91 and @entity92			0
at @entity93 , he played for the reserves while the then manager @entity95 watched from the stands and eventually signed for @entity69 in 2009 for £ 1.2million			2
@entity9 was arrested again in july after he posed as @entity14 to buy clothing worth more than £ 20,000 from a store in the @entity51 near @entity30 he was paid £ 4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £ 1,000 as a substitute , and £ 2,000 for starting a match			1
but his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to @entity103 on a free transfer in january 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance			2
in august 2012 he was signed by @entity106 with a wage of just £ 300 a week and was forced to supplement his income with part - time work as a taxi firm controller			2
fearing his friends would dump him , he took them for a night out in @entity24 where he duped staff at the @entity43 burlesque club in @entity44 into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar			1
when a waiter could not find the card , @entity9 said he was a @entity2 footballer and was ' good for the money ' by showing photos of himself posing in football shirts with @entity2 stars			2
he then racked up the five - figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests , buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £ 5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table			2
in all he ordered two jeroboams of @entity4 , each equivalent to four regular bottles , and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party			0

at the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his @entity148 football club but the court heard @entity9 had caused the waiter to become a laughing stock across @entity24 's nightlife			1
he appeared at @entity169 in february 2013 when his barrister @entity170 claimed his client had a ' dramatic fall from grace ' which his friends knew nothing about , adding : ' it 's not that he was going somewhere he had never been before			0
it 's the reverse - he was trying to live up to the expectations that his friends had of him			0
' he told the court that @entity9 's career as a professional football player had left him with a ' wholly unrealistic ' understanding of money and added : ' there is some background to this , which may explain why @entity9 thinks it normal behaviour to go to a nightclub and spend such sums			2
' it would appear that perhaps his understanding of adult life and finance was wholly unrealistic			0
' at the time @entity9 was given a six - month suspended sentence , ordered to carry out 150 hours ' unpaid work and banned from entering @entity23 nightclubs for a year			0
but he was arrested again in july after he posed as @entity14 to buy clothing worth more than £ 20,000 from a @entity51 store			1

the bill was paid for using compromised credit card details			0
he had also booked into the five - star @entity205 in @entity207 , after pretending to be @entity14 's agent but was subsequently caught by police after they found his fingerprints on a pair of @entity212 shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. he had also racked up a £ 9,600 tab at @entity216 in @entity217 and the @entity218			1
