by @entity0 @entity2 ' waistlines are getting bigger – and people living in the @entity4 are battling the bulge more than the rest of us			1
for new statistics suggest that @entity10 men are the most rotund around the middle , while ladies in the @entity4 are wider than their counterparts around the @entity2			1
the figures , released by the virtual fitting room company @entity17 , also have some startling health implications – and paint a worrying picture for the future			0
map showing the average waist size of men and women in the @entity2 , by region to avoid a massively raised risk of heart disease , cancer and diabetes , men 's waistlines should be no bigger than 37 inches and women 's no more than 32			1
but many men underestimate by up to two inches , say experts fat around the waist has been found to be worse for our health than fat on the bottom and hips , in terms of the risk of heart disease , cancer , infertility and cancer			1
not only is the fat nearer our vital organs such as the heart , liver and kidneys , but abdominal fat cells are more active than those around the thighs and bottom , producing toxic substances that can cause damage			0
so body shape , and where we carry excess fat , is just as important as overall weight			0
the @entity63 says that men should have a waistline of no more than 37 inches – after this , the risk of heart disease , cancer and diabetes rises significantly			1
women should have a waist measurement of no more than 32 inches			1
but those in several regions other than the @entity4 – namely @entity73 , north east @entity74 , @entity75 and southern @entity76 - were also found to have broken this benchmark			1
@entity10 men have the largest waistlines , while @entity80 chaps are the slimmest even their counterparts in the @entity83 , who had the lowest average measurement , were close to the threshold at 31.3 inches			1
in men , the average was 35.8 inches			2
@entity80 chaps were the slimmest , with an average waist size of 35.08 inches			2
the figures come from analysis of the measurements of 50,000 @entity2 men who have submitted their own measurements to one of @entity17 ’s virtual fitting rooms			1
the company 's ' fitting rooms ' are used by several retailers such as @entity99 and @entity100 , to help their customers buy the right size of garment when shopping online			0
however previous research casts doubt on whether , relatively speaking , men do have slimmer waists than women , as these figures suggest			2
a study last year from the @entity63 found that men underestimate the size of their waist by as much as two inches			1
the survey found that the average @entity2 man estimated that they had a waist size of 35.8 inches , more than two inches smaller than @entity74 and @entity76 national averages [ 37.9 and 38 inches respectively ]			1
ninety per cent of the 1,000 men surveyed by the charity even admitted that they did n't know how to measure their waist properly			0
almost half thought they could measure just above the hips - resulting in an inaccurately small measurement			0
only one in eight knew the correct method , which involves measuring at the midpoint between their ribs and the top of the hips			0
and just one in six men admitted to having a 40 inch - plus waist - half the actual number classed officially as having a high - risk waist size			2
my big @entity136 waistline : internationally , @entity136 men were found to have the largest waistlines , shortly followed by @entity140 and @entity141			2
pictured : @entity136 music and dance duo @entity144 internationally , @entity136 leads the way for the chunkiest waistlines , followed by @entity141 and @entity140			0
@entity2 men measure in at a respectable 58th out of 81 countries in which data was collected , with the global average waist measurement being 36.4 inches			1
@entity151 has the slimmest men , at an average 33.2 inches			0
the largest female waist measurements are in @entity154 ( 32.5in ) and @entity155 the thinnest ( 28.2in )			1
at 31.7inches , the @entity2 ’s ladies rank 11th ( out of 85 ) , with a global average for women of 30.1 inches			2
@entity159 was also collected for other measurements , such as chest and neck size			0
the average collar size for men in the @entity2 was 16.03			2
this too has health implications : a collar size of 17 increases the risk of snoring and sleep apnoea – where you stop breathing while asleep			0
this too raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes			1
‘ the best thing to do is lose some weight if your @entity185 is classed as obese ( 30 or more ) or you have a collar size of 17 or more , ’ says mr @entity177 , a consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at the @entity181 in @entity182			0
‘ a large amount of weight increases pressure on your neck , so your airways are more likely to collapse and you will snore			0
reducing that pressure by losing weight can make big difference			0

men in @entity10 have the biggest waist measurements , followed by those in @entity201 and @entity202
women in the @entity4 and @entity73 largest around the middle
nearly every area of the @entity2 has measurement near the ' danger ' level for an increased risk of heart disease , cancer , infertility and diabetes
figures follow research which found most men underestimate their waistlines by two inches
