@entity6 , who weighed a whopping 23 stone saw a photo of her and her podgy pet @entity10 and realised they looked identical			1
it spurred her into action and she put both her and @entity10 on a strict diet			0
whopping weight loss : @entity6 dropped a staggering eight dress sizes in just over a year , she has lost almost 12 stone and @entity10 is nearly 4lbs lighter			1
@entity6 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , said : ' i did n’t realise just how big i had got until i saw the picture of me and my pug , @entity10			1
' i was absolutely mortified by it			0
at that point i knew i had to do something about the pounds i ’d piled on			0
' it ’s been hard but now i look and feel great			0
people stare at me for a different reason			0
' @entity6 , 35 , started piling on the pounds as a teenager and by the time she hit 30 she struggled to squeeze into her size 32 jeans			1
in march last year , lacking in confidence and energy , @entity6 decided to join the @entity36			1
the registered nurse bulged to a size 32 after gorging on takeaway meals and donor kebabs and admits her biggest weakness was chocolate cake			1
podgy pals : @entity6 decided to lose weight after seeing a photo of her and her dog @entity10 and being shocked by their similarity she said : ' i would eat at least one whole cake , all to myself , a week and i used to deep - fry all my meals , i absolutely loved chips and had them with everything			1
i cringe when i think back to what i used to eat			0
' i used to see my mum on a weekly basis and even she would notice each visit how much weight i ’d gain within a few days			0
i was eating the wrong foods , in the wrong portion sizes and at the wrong times , whilst doing absolutely no exercise			2
' different person : @entity6 now feels confident to buy clothes that she wants unhealthy eating habits coupled with a lack of exercise resulted in @entity6 suffering from crippling back pain			1
her health problems encouraged her to ditch the fatty food and embark on a grueling exercise regime			0
@entity6 still allows herself the occasional treat and said : ' i still love pizza and sometimes i treat myself to a slice but i ’ve learned not to over-indulge and can now stop myself from eating the whole pizza , just having the one small piece			2
if i have something naughty i ’ll make sure i burn it off at the gym too			0
' although pugs are designed to be chunky , @entity10 needed to lose a bit of weight too			0
before , @entity10 and @entity6 struggled to walk short distances and even used to drive 400 yards down the road to the shop to stock up on sugary snacks			1
@entity6 is now a slender size 14 , after quitting sweets and chocolate , and both she and @entity10 are reaping the benefits of their weight loss , taking long walks and getting plenty of exercise			1
@entity6 is also enjoying refreshing her wardrobe , having dropped eight dress sizes , and said : ' i love being able to pop into high street shops like @entity100 and buy clothes i ’d never have even dreamed of wearing			1
' she used to hide behind jet black clothing and her long , dark hair , but now @entity6 has the confidence to go for a short , bleach blonde style and wears bright , colourful dresses and heels			2
despite this she clings onto her old clothes and said : ' i ’ve kept the top and jeans that i was wearing in the picture with @entity10 to remind me how far i ’ve come			2
i never want to put the weight back on and seeing them hang like tents in my wardrobe makes me determined to stay slim			0
' @entity6 said : ' i definitely feel much sexier now			2
i sometimes now go out on dates , but working at the care home and going to the gym does n’t leave me with much time to meet men ! ' the picture of @entity6 and @entity10 was taken at a work party and uploaded to a photo album on the work computers that all staff could access and colleagues have noticed a massive difference in @entity6 ’s confidence since losing the weight			2
she said : ' people at work call me tigger from @entity134 because i ’m always happy and bouncing around with bundles of energy , whereas before i used to mope around like @entity137 ! ' @entity6 only has a stone and a half to lose before achieving her target weight of ten stone			1
she said : ' @entity10 is my inspiration , my one and all			0
i love her to bits and she has been my star supporter and i ’m proud of her too ! '			0
