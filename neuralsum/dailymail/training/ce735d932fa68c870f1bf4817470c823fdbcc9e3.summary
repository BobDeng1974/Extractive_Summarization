a @entity5 diet , full of fish , vegetables , berries and rapeseed oil can reduce the damaging effects of being overweight , a study found			1
@entity5 researchers discovered the @entity5 diet can prevent inflammation which is associated with many obesity - related diseases			1
the diet seems to stops the expression of a gene in fat cells found below the skin , which is associated with inflammation			1
inflammation of the fat tissue below the skin , known as the subcutaneous adipose tissue , is believed to cause many health problems such as type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure			1
a @entity5 diet including fresh fish three times a week can reduce the health - damaging effects of being overweight , researchers discovered it is also associated with a condition called athlerosclerosis - where the arties become clogged up with fatty substances known as plaques			1
these can cause the arteries to harden and narrow , restricting blood flow to organs and stop them functioning			0
they can also cause blood clots , which can trigger a heart attack or a stroke			0
the @entity5 diet has been touted as the next big trend in weight loss			2
it involves eating seasonal ingredients including fresh vegetables and fruit , foraged herbs – even dandelions – from the wild , lots of fish , less meat and more game			2
@entity57 researchers published a study earlier this year which found that overweight @entity60 on the healthy @entity5 diet lost three times as much weight as those eating more typical fare such as meat balls , pizza and spaghetti			1
researchers from the @entity70 wanted to find out whether the @entity5 diet could affect inflammation that causes chronic diseases like obesity and high blood pressure , without weight loss			1
they recruited middle aged men and women exhibiting at least two characteristics of metabolic syndrome , a combination of type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity			1
this included increased blood pressure , high blood sugar levels even at fasting , abnormal levels of fat in the blood , or being at slightly overweight			0
for a period of 18 to 24 weeks , half of the study participants followed the health - promoting @entity5 diet consisting of whole grain products , vegetables , root vegetables , berries , fruit , low - fat dairy products , rapeseed oil and three servings of fish per week			1
the @entity5 diet involves ditching olive oil for controlled amounts of rapeseed oil ( pictured left , with a field of rapeseeds pictured right ) the control group consumed low - fibre grain products , butter - based spreads , and had a limited intake of fish			2
participants were asked to keep their body weight the same during the study , and researchers found no significant weight changes occurred during this time			0
samples of their fatty tissue were taken at the beginning and end of the study , and transcriptomics analysis was performed in order to study the expression of genes			0
the researchers found differences in the functioning of as many as 128 genes in the fatty tissue as a result of the diet			0
the expression of several inflammation - associated genes was lower than in the control group			0
the researchers said it is ‘ significant ’ that diet can be used to affect the expression of genes associated with inflammation , without weight loss			2
eating a handful of bilberries a day could reduce the effects of a high - fat diet , scientists found a handful of bilberries a day could help reduce the impact of a high - fat diet , scientists found			2
eating the small , blue , flat - topped fruit - the wilder , more acidic version of a blueberry - diminishes the harmful effects of eating a lot of fat			0
for the first time , the berries - which are grown in the wild in the north of @entity162 and are a key part of the @entity5 diet - were shown to have beneficial effects on both blood pressure and inflammation			1
inflammation is the body ’s natural immune response and is initially beneficial , but can cause several conditions and diseases in the long term			0
the @entity70 researchers believe the beneficial health effects of bilberries are due to high levels of polyphenols			0
these are a a disease - fighting chemical component significantly higher in bilberries than in commercially - cultivated blueberries .			0

@entity5 diet is full of fish , vegetables , berries and rapeseed oils
it stops the expression of a gene associated with inflammation in fat cells
inflammation is associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes
effects were seen without those on the diet losing weight , say researchers
