by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:10 est , 15 february 2014 when mother - of - three @entity3 crossed the finish line of the @entity6 her real challenge was only just beginning			1
little more than a year later after completing the 26.2mile course , the 31 - year - old would undergo a preventative double mastectomy - spending eight hours in surgery in order to drastically cut her chances of getting breast cancer			1
mrs @entity3 was just 26 , and a new mother to her eldest son @entity15 , when she discovered she carried the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) gene - a genetic mutation that meant she had an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 40 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer			1
mother : @entity3 , pictured with her daughter @entity24 , three , underwent a preventative double mastectomy after discovering she carried the @entity17 gene runner : mrs @entity3 at the start of the @entity6 ( left ) , and crossing the finish line			1
she took up running to get fit for her operation and now plans to run the course again now , just nine - months after the potentially life - saving operation , mrs @entity3 is preparing to take on the marathon for a second time - despite fearing that she would never run again after the drastic surgery , having struggled to walk or even sit in a chair			1
mrs @entity3 , from @entity36 , was 10 weeks pregnant with @entity15 when she learned that the @entity17 gene was present in her family			1
as an expectant mother , she was forced to wait to be tested until after the birth of her first child while one by one her loved ones underwent the test , each one coming back positive			0
' it was heartbreaking , ' she said			0
' next up was me and i just wanted to know one way or the other i already knew that if i had the gene i would opt for a double mastectomy , luckily i had time on my hands			0
' her aunt , uncle , father , sister and brother all carried the gene , and @entity15 , now four , and her twins @entity56 and @entity24 , three , each have a 50 per cent chance of being @entity17 positive			2
family : mrs @entity3 with her husband @entity62 , and her children ( left to right ) twins @entity24 and @entity56 , both three , and four - year - old @entity15 having given birth to her twins in january 2011 , mrs @entity3 began her marathon training as a means to get fit before the operation			2
in july last year surgeons carried out the operation , while tissue and fat were taken from the top of both her legs and used to ' build ' her new breasts			1
her journey to recovery did not go smoothly			0
mrs @entity3 suffered some serious complications and within just six weeks had gone under the knife three times			0
complication : mrs @entity3 was rushed back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size she was rushed back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size and needed the fluid flushed out , leaving her a further eight weeks from being able to do any exercise			1
she now has a 12inch scar on each leg , while her original bruising from the surgery ran from her shoulders to her knees			2
but following the surgery her chances of developing breast cancer were slashed to just six per cent , and she is now embarking on her second marathon			1
she is determined to show other women that even following such major surgery anything is possible			0
' following my double mastectomy i felt like i would never run again , ' she said			0
' i struggled to sit in a chair and even to walk			0
running a marathon seemed impossible then but , as i embark on my training again i want to show the world anything is possible			0
' she added : ' running does n't come naturally to me , far from it			0
' the thought of a long run makes me want to cry and the thought of doing the marathon again and the training it entails fills me with fear but i feel like it would be the ultimate comeback and will hopefully show other women with breast cancer or having preventative surgery that pain is temporary and your body will get stronger			1
' mrs @entity3 is running the gruelling 26.2 miles to raise funds for breast cancer research charity @entity132 , for whom she has written a blog documenting her @entity17 journey - from finding out she carried the gene , to the recovery from her operation as well as her marathon training			1
' this is my second @entity6 , but that does n’t make it any easier , ' she said			0
support : mrs @entity3 with her husband @entity62 , and with her mother @entity145 ' for me , it ’s all about raising money , raising awareness and just generally " campaigning " against breast cancer			1
' i have met so many amazing women ( and men ) since i found i had a mutation of the @entity17 gene and they inspire me to be better and to be grateful			1
' the marathon is my way of giving back to them and giving back to the charity and to show to myself how strong i can be			0
' it feels tougher than before and it feels harder than i expected it to but that makes me all the more determined			0
worry : mrs @entity3 's children each have a 50 per cent chance of carrying the @entity17 gene			1
mrs @entity3 found out she had the gene after she gave birth to @entity15 , now four ' all i ask for is no snow or rain between now and april			2
' breast cancer is the most common cancer in the @entity169 and accounts for nearly one in three of all cancers in women			2
in the @entity169 , around 50,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year - around 138 a day			2
there has been an increasing awareness of faulty brca genes in the last few years , particularly since actress @entity178 revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy after discovering that she carried the @entity181 gene			0
this spring @entity183 viewers will watch as popular character @entity184 , played by @entity185 , discovers that she has the @entity17 gene , which will have implication for daughters @entity188 and @entity145			2
storyline : this spring @entity183 viewers will watch as popular character @entity184 , played by @entity185 , discovers that she has the @entity17 gene ground - breaking : @entity184 's upcoming storyline , which started earlier this month as the @entity195 matriarch decided to be tested for the gene , is the first time a soap opera has focused on brca @entity184 's upcoming storyline , which started earlier this month as the @entity195 matriarch decided to be tested for the gene , is the first time a @entity169 soap opera has focused on @entity17			1
through running the @entity6 , mrs @entity3 hopes to raise £ 2,000 for @entity132 - which will help fund research into the disease , and the @entity17 genes			1
' without research into the @entity17 gene , i would n’t have been able to make the decisions i have been able to make , ' she said			2
' that is why i have chosen to run the @entity208 once again for @entity132 , so i can raise more money to help the charity continue to fund vital research into breast cancer			0
