he would become one of the youngest people in a @entity16 correctional facility			2

' in reality , sometimes kids - just like all of us - do things because they want to , and he decided , as he put it , it was time to end the father - son thing , ' said @entity44 , chief deputy district attorney			2
' this child started at five years old being expelled from school for violence			0
his violence started way before his dad ever joined any @entity50			1
' the boy 's public defender , @entity51 , told the @entity53 his client has neurological and psychological problems and was exposed to @entity57 ' conditioning ' at home			2
' he 's been conditioned to violence , ' @entity51 told the newspaper			0
' you have to ask yourself : did this kid really know that this act was wrong based on all those things ? ' mr @entity7 , who had @entity50 tattoos on his head , took @entity7 to rallies where they performed @entity50 salutes together			1
they also went on night - time ' patrols ' by the @entity73 border wearing night - vision goggles to help them ' detain illegal immigrants '			0
deadly : a .357 snub nosed revolver like the one used in the killing opening statements are expected to begin today in the two - week trial of the boy , who is not being charged as an adult			2
@entity7 , who said he believed in a white breakaway nation , ran for a seat on the local water board in 2010 in a move that disturbed many residents in the recession - battered suburbs southeast of @entity90			2
the day before his death , he held a meeting of the @entity57 group at his home			0
