although diplomatic relations between @entity21 and @entity37 over @entity4 have plunged into the deep freeze , the @entity35 insisted that the mission , called @entity40 ’ 13 , is a long - planned exercise			1

and while the deployment could have been delayed to avoid upsetting the @entity37 government , it was not			0
a @entity52 source said : ‘ the timing is not unhelpful			0
