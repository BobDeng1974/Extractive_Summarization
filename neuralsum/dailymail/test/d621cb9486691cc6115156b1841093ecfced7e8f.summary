crusaders in chains by @entity2 journalists tend to be a fund of good stories and @entity2 , who has worked in national newspapers for 60 years , is no exception			1
what shines through this memoir is that journalism is a serious business , but it is also fun			2
his best stories are from his days as editor of the @entity18 gossip column in the @entity19			2
@entity2 ( pictured ) has worked in newspapers for 60 years once , he answered the phone and an aristocratic voice said : ‘ @entity29 here			1
that awful chap @entity31 has been round @entity32 writing “ @entity33 is better ” on our brochures and giving them to our visitors			2
that ’s the sort of thing you like to print in your newspaper , is n’t it ? ’ he put the phone down without further conversation			0
fearing a hoax , @entity2 rang @entity40 , home to the @entity41 , where the butler said , haughtily , that the @entity41 never spoke to the @entity43 and was in his bath , so could n’t be disturbed			1
@entity2 pointed out that the @entity41 would be cross — very cross — with the butler if he was not asked to confirm his call			1
a chastened butler later called back to confirm that the @entity41 himself had , indeed , called @entity47			0
@entity2 rang @entity33 , where the @entity48 confirmed the story			1
next , he sent a motorcyclist to @entity32 to pick up a brochure and then ride over to @entity33 to get it signed and brought back to @entity53			1
it was the lead story in @entity18 next day			0
at that time , the @entity19 was owned by @entity55			0
he rang @entity2 to say how much he enjoyed the tale			1
often , however , his calls about the subject of a story would be more ominous			0
‘ very good story in your column this morning , mr @entity2 , ’ he would say			1
‘ i hope it is true			0
’ ‘ i believe so , @entity55			0
’ ‘ good , i ’m lunching with him today , ’ he would bark			2
@entity2 worked in @entity53 during the glory days , when reporters kept four pennies in their pockets for the telephone box , a knife to puncture the tyres of rival reporters ’ cars , and enjoyed liquid lunches on expenses			1
@entity2 describes a lunch with an @entity19 editor , during which they drank champagne , a goblet of dry sherry , a bottle of @entity84 , two bottles of claret , a couple of @entity88 and , finally , several glasses of port			1
the editor went back to work			0
but more good stories were elicited over a boozy lunch than can ever come from a tuna sandwich at the desk			1
and they were also the days when @entity2 , as editor of @entity18 , could ring @entity101 on his yacht at @entity103 and be invited over to meet @entity104			1
or plot with @entity105 , then the world ’s richest private citizen , to disentangle himself from his girlfriend , @entity108 , who had moved into his @entity109 home and was angling for marriage			0
@entity2 suggested an interview in which oil billionaire @entity105 made it plain that he was never going to remarry , with the headline ‘ i ’m married to an oil rag ’ , i.e. my oil business comes before women			1
shortly afterwards , @entity119 and @entity108 were dining with the paper ’s proprietor , @entity55			0
@entity108 complained about @entity2 and said the story he ’d written was n’t true			1
@entity55 turned to @entity105 — who said that , on the contrary , it was the only article ever written about him that was 100 per cent true			0
@entity108 packed her bags and left			0
a grateful @entity119 gave @entity2 the freedom of @entity109			2
the peak of @entity2 ’s 60 - year career came when he was editor of the @entity19 , which then sold two million copies a week			1
@entity2 is now an elder statesman of the @entity43 and works for the @entity131 , where he is a leader of the fight against attempts by the state to extend its control over the media and to put newspapers in chains			1
he is particularly critical of the recommendations in the @entity140 that threaten the right to protect journalists ’ sources , and which mean information acquired confidentially can be seized by the police			2
he points out that legislation designed to have a chilling effect on investigative journalism already exists — laws on contempt of court , data protection , bribery , harassment and terrorism , among others			0
there is also the arrival by the back door of a privacy law			0
the @entity161 is now regulated and self - regulated to such an extent , he says , that it is only half - free			0
the ‘ outrageous ’ recommendation that whistleblowers should report misgivings only to the organisation that is responsible for the abuses — never to the media — guarantees that fewer scandals will be exposed			0
at least one politician — the @entity172 veteran @entity171 — gets @entity2 ’s blessing , though			2
the information commissioner , @entity175 , had been campaigning for prison sentences for those who breached the @entity178 ; newspapers worried almost any inquiry by a journalist risked being classified as a breach			2
@entity171 and @entity47 were sitting together at a conference when @entity175 approached them and made his pitch for prison punishment			0
‘ if you think i am going to stuff my jails full of people who break your @entity178 , you have another think coming , ’ @entity171 roared			0
of course newspapers must continue to entertain , @entity2 concludes , but they must also be a thorn in the sides of those in power , wrongdoers and those who abuse the young and old .			1

journalists are known for being a fund of good stories
@entity2 has worked in newspapers for 60 years and is no exception
in his new book he reveals the inner workings of @entity53 as it was
