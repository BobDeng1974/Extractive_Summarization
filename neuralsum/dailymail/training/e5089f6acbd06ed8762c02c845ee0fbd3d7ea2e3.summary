an 18 - year - old @entity1 girl has married a stray dog as part of a tribal ritual designed to ward off an evil spell			1
@entity9 , from a remote village in the eastern @entity1 state of @entity8 , wed the canine in a lavish ceremony			1
the wedding was hastily organised by village elders after a local guru led @entity9 's parents to believe that the teenager possessed ill - luck and that marrying a man would bring destruction to the family and her community			1
@entity9 , who has not been to school , said she was not happy to wed a dog , but insisted that it will help change her fortunes			2
the hesitant bride said : ' i am marrying a dog because the village elders believe that my evil spell will be passed on to the dog			1
' after that is done , the man i will marry will have a long life			0
' @entity9 's father @entity55 agreed			2
he said : ' the village elders told us that we should organise the wedding as soon as we can			1
we had to make sure that the evil spell is destroyed			0
tradition : rituals being performed during the wedding in the remote village good turn - out : around 70 relatives attended the ceremony in the eastern @entity1 state of @entity8 ' and marrying a dog is the only way to get rid of the bad luck			1
' and amazingly , this is not the first time that a local girl has wed a dog in the village			2
@entity55 added : ' many weddings like this have taken place in our village and also the other neighbouring villages			0
this is a custom that we thoroughly believe in			0
' according to the village 's customs , the marriage will not affect @entity9 's life , and she will be free to marry again later without divorcing the dog			1
the big day : @entity9 poses with her father , @entity55 , and her stray dog husband ' my villagers say that many girls like me have followed this ritual and they have gotten rid of their evil spells and are living happy lives now , ' said @entity9			2
' i will also be free to marry a man of my dreams after after the evil spell is over			0
' at the wedding ceremony , people danced to traditional drumming , while around 70 relatives and local villagers attended the wedding			0
@entity105 : the bride 's father carries @entity31 in his friend 's car on the wedding day ' apart from the fact that the groom is a dog , we followed all customs			0
we respect the dog as much as we would respect a normal groom , ' said @entity9 's mother seems @entity119			1
' we had to spend money on this wedding in the same way as we would in a normal wedding			0
but that is the only way we can get rid of her bad luck and ensure the benevolence of the village			1
' now with the marriage ceremony over , @entity9 has to take care of the dog and raise him as a pet for the next few months			1
@entity9 added : ' i will marry a man one day			2
it is the dream of every girl to marry a prince charming			0
so i am also waiting for my prince			0

@entity9 was told by village elders that she was cursed with bad luck
to lift the spell *permanently* the teenager was ordered to marry a dog
