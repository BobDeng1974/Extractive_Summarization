this shocking video footage captures a smiling young girl on a moving train , who - encouraged by her laughing friends - sticks her head out of the window and straight into the path of another speeding train approaching from the opposite direction			1
with her entire head out of the window she grins widely for the camera - despite the train hurtling towards her at top speed - before ducking back inside the carriage at the last possible second as it whips past			1

she immediately complies , removing her sunglasses and smiling into the lens of the camera as the train is seen bearing down behind her			0
the front of the train appears to be just inches from the girl 's head when at last she pulls it back inside			2
