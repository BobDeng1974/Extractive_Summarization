by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:17 pm on 17th december 2011 police have confirmed that remains found on @entity5 's @entity4 this week are those of missing prostitute @entity6 , who vanished last december after fleeing a client 's home in a panic			1
searchers found the bones on tuesday morning in a dense wetland , not far from the neighbourhood where the 24 - year - old disappeared in may 2010			1
while the medical examiner has positively identified the remains , police have not yet determined the cause of her death			1
the remains of @entity6 make it 11 the @entity41 woman went missing after fleeing from a client 's home in @entity34			2
she was last seen racing into the night , toward the marsh where her remains were discovered tuesday			2
police began searching for her last december when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide victims ' remains			1
they were strewn along several miles of thicket along a parkway leading to @entity54			0
police have said that they believe @entity56 may have drowned accidentally while fleeing a client 's home for an unclear reason			1
two weeks ago , a search turned up @entity56 's purse , containing her @entity62 , cell phone and lip gloss , as well as her jeans and shoes			1
the body was found about a quarter of a mile from where her belongings were found in an area with thick , overgrown brush			1
the 24 - year - old @entity56 was a prostitute who advertised her services on @entity75 @entity77 police commissioner @entity76 said : ' we went in with the idea we were going in one last time to see if we could find anything and we did			1
' this is very tough brambled area , difficult to traverse , you ca n't walk through that area and this is why it has taken us so long to find			0
' he said the location of the skeleton suggests that @entity56 may have been trying to flee across the wetland to a causeway			1
he suggested that she had become hopelessly entangled in the brush , which he called a ' tough , desolate , tangled mess '			0
he said : ' the terrain would have made it impossible			0
our people who were in there over the last few days had to cut through that brush and bramble area , before she was located			0
' officers had to use heavy , earth - moving equipment to excavate the site			2
@entity56 's disappearance prompted the investigation which led to five bodies found in burlap sacks on @entity38 last december			1
the bodies have been positively identified as prostitutes advertising on @entity75			2
since then , five more bodies have been found which have yet to be identified			2
police said they think @entity56 's disappearance is unrelated to the other bodies but a single killer may be responsible for the ten dead			2
relatives of @entity118 and @entity119 , whose bodies were among the ten found , visited the scene on the first anniversary of the grisly discovery			2
' it 's been a living hell , ' @entity118 's mother @entity124 told reporters on monday			0

two days later , three more bodies were found			0
by april , the total had risen to 10 bodies , all strewn along several miles of @entity155 , on a barrier island south of @entity4 that leads to @entity54			0
authorities at first believed several people could be involved , but police commissioner @entity76 has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade			0
the victims included eight women , an @entity168 man wearing a dress and a toddler			0
police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was wearing women ’s clothing			0
the toddler is believed to be the child of one of the prostitutes			0
