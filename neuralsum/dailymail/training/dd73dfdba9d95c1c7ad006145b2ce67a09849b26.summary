it was the @entity11 manager @entity10 who made the comparison between the two men in the run up to this match , attempting to convey something of the @entity19 ’s special talent			1
perhaps he might wish to temper his praise in future , for @entity9 played like a man inspired by the compliment			2
he was sublime and @entity10 , if not quite weeping by the end , would at least have been overwhelmed with emotion : frustration , mainly			0

goal : @entity91 15 booked : @entity82 , @entity88 , sent off : @entity83 ratings by @entity103 at the @entity104 in a game of four penalties – only two of them awarded correctly - @entity9 scored four goals , might have had seven were it not for @entity35 and dominated a game in which @entity38 chose to rest key men for their crucial @entity113 clash in @entity114 on tuesday			1
not content with that list of achievements , he also surpassed @entity117 as @entity38 ’s all time @entity44 scorer			0
and yet @entity10 ’s despair was legitimate given that @entity11 played well , were the victim of some poor decisions , and had the opportunity to bring the the game back to 2 - 2 on 61 minutes when @entity94 missed a penalty			1
well though @entity94 played up to that point , you fear that might represent the point of no return for his confidence as a @entity44 player			2
instead of pushing @entity38 to the bitter end , @entity11 added yet another excruciating result to their recent run against @entity38 : 0 - 6 , 1 - 5 and 1 - 4 runs the sequence since last november			2
‘ it was amusing game for the fans , ’ said @entity29 , in his precise but idiosyncratic @entity135			0
‘ it was 4 - 1 but it could have been 7 - 3			0
it ’s very important to be an attractive team but maybe it ’s important also not to make as many mistakes , especially with excessive trust , with the ball at our feet			0
’ indeed , were you inclined to picky , the laxity of @entity38 ’s holding midfielders once @entity66 had gone off injured would be a major point of concern			0
still , the brilliance of @entity9 made it hard to dwell on negatives			1
‘ he is one of three of four best strikers in the world , ’ dead panned @entity29 , as excited as an accountant announcing mediocre end - of - year results			0
‘ i ’m not just saying it after this game : it was not easy for him last year when he had so many injuries to produce these kind of performances when he ’s not 100 per cent fit			0
now he demonstrates how he can play			0
maybe he wo n’t score four goals a game but he will demonstrate why everyone says he is one of the best players in the world			0
’ for @entity10 there were only regrets			0
‘ it ’s tough to accept the result , because the performance was good , ’ he said			0
the persistence and determination of @entity88 and the guile of @entity91 gave them a real opportunity to obtain points from this game ; yet the rash decisions of @entity84 and @entity83 would cost them			1
@entity94 also missed a penalty with @entity60 saving well down to his left hand side @entity60 is at full stretch to save @entity94 's penalty , as the @entity194 striker looks on in shock ( below ) @entity83 was sent off after tugging @entity9 back ... before the striker converted the fourth penalty of the game the former @entity200 star fired his first goal past a host of @entity11 defenders , including captain @entity84 @entity91 made the match 1 - 1 with a drilled strike , @entity63 and @entity60 look despondent in the foreground @entity207 desperately tries to block the @entity209 's incoming shot a crazy summary of events at the @entity104 ... check out more stats using our match zone service @entity9 takes the match ball after the game ... his performance would have delighted boss @entity29 @entity218 miles @entity38 111.5 69.3 @entity65 90 12.8 8.0 @entity70 90 11.5 7.1 @entity61 90 10.8 6.7 @entity11 114.7 71.3 @entity91 90 11.8 7.3 @entity84 90 10.9 6.8 @entity219 90 10.9 6.8 @entity11 should have taken the lead on eight minutes , @entity94 playing in @entity88 , who should have scored from close range but was denied by @entity60			1
you suspected @entity11 would suffer for that and on twelve minutes @entity92 lost the ball to @entity61 who found @entity9 in tight space in the penalty area			1
@entity84 thought he had him covered , but there is no real containing the @entity229			0
he simply jinxed away to create space and shoot beyond @entity35			0
yet @entity11 had legitimate cause for complaint , @entity66 , preferred to the rested @entity69 , jumping over the ball in an offside position as it headed goal - wards			2
no matter , for within a minute @entity11 were level			0
@entity68 lost the ball to the superb @entity88 , @entity94 picking up the scraps and feeding @entity91 , who fired in off the cross bar			1
but they were n’t level for long			0
on 19 minutes @entity92 attempted a clumsy but innocuous challenge on @entity66 , who fell to ground in the manner of a seasoned professional and a penalty was awarded			2
it was barely a penalty but @entity9 simply stroked the ball past @entity35			1
the game threatened to run away from @entity11 for the first time on 32 minutes			0
this time it was @entity84 committing a rash challenge on @entity71 in the area and this time the penalty was legitimate			0
but this time @entity9 proved fallible , allowing @entity35 to save with his legs			2
even then , such is his ability , @entity9 almost scored anyway , leaping in the air to volley the impossibly - high rebound over			1
a @entity35 versus @entity9 side show was developing – the @entity258 produced excellent saves on 24 minutes and 49 minutes – but @entity11 stayed in the contest			1
@entity91 ’s strike on 40 minutes tested @entity60 and the @entity209 set up @entity88 on 41 minutes , whose strike required excellent reactions from @entity60			1
@entity66 was accused of diving after going down easily under the challenge of @entity92 for the first penalty @entity84 gave away the second penalty of the afternoon after a late slide on @entity194 midfielder @entity71 @entity66 was taken off on a stretcher midway through the first half at the @entity104 it seemed to be a thigh strain for @entity66 , but it is unclear how serious the injury was @entity66 seemed to injure himself under the challenge of @entity276 , though there was not much contact it was on 61 minutes that @entity60 came into his own			1
@entity94 spun his marker @entity62 , and was clipped , crucially , outside the penalty area			2
regardless referee @entity283 awarded the spot kick			2
@entity94 took the kick , lamely , and @entity60 , diving splendidly to his right , stretched out a hand to save			2
@entity60 again was on hand to parry away a @entity94 volley on 64 minutes , a key moment for @entity10			2
however , @entity11 do have that innate capacity to self - destruct			0
@entity83 had performed competently on his @entity44 debut until the 66th minute when the sight of @entity9 rushing away on to a @entity70 cross proved too much and he and hauled the @entity19 back , unnecessarily , as there was still plenty required of the @entity19 to score			1
a red card , a fourth penalty and a hat - trick for @entity9 ensued			1
@entity9 added the fourth , simply finding space from a deep free kick , this time at the expense of @entity307 , and shooting low past @entity35 on 75 minutes			1
yesterday , there was containing his genius , not unlike that well - known @entity310 playmaker , @entity6			0
@entity91 looks to avoid the tackle of @entity38 's @entity313 substitute @entity67 @entity314 barks out instructions from the touchline while @entity29 watches on @entity11 youngster @entity276 tries to keep up with @entity38 's @entity19 star @entity9 @entity38 's goat @entity318 is taken onto the pitch at half - time @entity322 managers @entity314 and @entity29 shake hands before kick - off at the @entity104 @entity9 greets several ecstatic school children as he makes his way into the ground @entity11 chairman @entity328 shares a joke with @entity38 chairman @entity330			1

@entity9 opened the scoring after 13 minutes before @entity91 equalised almost immediately
the @entity19 striker converted then first penalty of the afternoon *shortly* after but missed another in the first - half
@entity94 had a chance to make it 2 - 2 but missed his spot - kick
@entity9 made no mistake with the fourth of the day , converting his hat - trick in the process
@entity83 was sent off for tugging @entity9 back before the penalty , and he later scored his fourth goal
