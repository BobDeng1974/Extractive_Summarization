the @entity1 ’s most sophisticated warship has been ordered to the @entity2 in a display of strength as tensions rise with @entity6			1
@entity7 is sending the £ 1billion @entity8 on a seven - month deployment to the @entity10 while @entity11 ratchets up pressure over sovereignty of the islands			1
the vessel , which bristles with fearsome anti-aircraft weapons , will patrol the coastline during celebrations to mark the liberation of the islands 30 years ago			0
fact file on the @entity21 and its capabilities officials said sending out the type 45 destroyer on her maiden voyage was not a response to increased tensions over the sovereignty of the islands and that it had been planned for a while this will coincide with prince @entity32 ’s posting to the @entity2 as an @entity34 search - and - rescue pilot – seen by @entity6 as a provocative act			1
and foreign office minister @entity36 has announced he will visit the @entity2 in june for the commemorations			0
the @entity38 confirmed that @entity39 would sail at the end of march , but insisted it was a ‘ routine ’ deployment			1
after returning to work following a cancer scare , @entity6 's president , @entity44 , wasted little time in attacking @entity47 's ' colonialism ' statement , saying @entity7 did n't have ' reasons or arguments ' in december , the @entity51 grouping of countries , which includes @entity6 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , announced that it would ban ships sailing under the @entity2 flag from docking at their ports the @entity7 people of @entity62 should be barred from any talks over the future of the disputed colony , @entity60 has said			1
@entity66 , the country 's new prime minister , risked a furious diplomatic row by insisting officials on the @entity70 should be excluded from sovereignty discussions			1
@entity47 is facing fresh calls from @entity73 to open negotiations on ownership of the territory			0
the @entity7 premier angered @entity60 meps last week by insisting that the future of @entity62 would depend on the colony 's 30,000 residents			2
going against their wishes of the people - who have in the past voted to remain @entity7 - would amount to ' recolonisation ' , he said			2
but mr @entity66 and @entity60 's new foreign minister @entity87 have vowed to raise demands for fresh talks with the @entity90			0
mr @entity91 has already written to @entity7 foreign secretary @entity92 stressing that there was no mention of self - determination for @entity96 in the @entity97 of 1713			2
@entity60 ceded @entity62 to @entity7 in perpetuity under the treaty after the @entity100			2
but @entity73 has defiantly refused to recognise the agreement , which includes territorial waters three miles around the @entity70 , and has repeatedly tried to reclaim them			0
under the previous @entity105 @entity60 government , the authorities in @entity62 were included in three - way talks with @entity73 and @entity107			0
but the discussions stalled last year after clashes in waters near the @entity70 between the @entity1 , @entity112 police and @entity60 's @entity113			0
earlier this month , mr @entity91 made a sneaky jibe over the disputed sovereignty of @entity62 in the @entity116			0
as @entity120 @entity119 mp @entity118 rose to congratulate him on his appointment , the @entity117 quipped : ' @entity62 , @entity122			0
' , which translates as ' @entity62 , @entity60 ! '			0
she is taking over from @entity125 , a type 23 frigate which is far less powerful			0
however , @entity128 commanders admitted sending the state - of - the - art warship to the region would deliver a strong signal that @entity7 had no intention of relinquishing the disputed territory			1
a @entity1 source said : ‘ dauntless is an elite warship			0
‘ she is going to the @entity2 on a routine deployment , but the fact that the @entity1 is sending her and not one of the older warships is significant			2
’ tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 @entity2 conflict , which cost the lives of 255 @entity7 and 649 @entity6 servicemen			1
@entity11 has recently renewed claims to the islands			0
it has imposed an economic blockade on @entity2 fishing vessels , which have been repeatedly intimidated by @entity6 warships			2
the islands ’ population of 3,000 want to remain @entity7			1
@entity120 mp @entity156 , a member of the defence select committee , said : ‘ this sends a very powerful and timely message to @entity6 that @entity7 means business when it comes to defending the @entity2			1
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the deployment of @entity21 to the @entity10 has been long planned , is entirely routine and replaces another ship on station			1
’ admiral lord @entity167 , former @entity168 and @entity2 veteran who led @entity169 when she was sunk by @entity6 with the loss of 22 men , said : ' the type 45s are becoming a key part of our modern force			1
' the thing that is fascinating about them is they have got the most amazing anti-air warfare capability			0
' should there be any foolish nonsense from @entity6 , @entity39 can sit just off the airfield and take down any aircraft coming in			2
it is a game - changing capability			0
' meanwhile former head of the @entity187 , general sir @entity186 said it would be ‘ just about impossible ’ to retake the @entity2 if @entity6 invades			2
general sir @entity186 warned that defence cuts meant that the @entity7 no longer has the capability to get the islands back if the @entity6 secured the airfield			1
the issue is especially sensitive as the 30th anniversary approaches of the liberation of the islands by @entity7 from an @entity6 invasion			1

deployment comes after rows between @entity7 and @entity6 governments
countries arguing over sovereignty of islands
@entity38 deny sending out type 45 destroyer in response to increased tensions
say move was ' long planned '
@entity7 minister will travel to the islands to commemorate 30th anniversary of @entity10
