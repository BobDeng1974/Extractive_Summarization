the @entity0 has today declared a national flu epidemic as virulent mutated versions of this years @entity4 virus sweep the country			1
twenty - two states have reported a high number of flu cases , centered mainly around the @entity9 and southeast of the country			2
since the start of the flu season on october 1 and december 20 , @entity0 figures show that 15 children have died from the virus and four in the week before @entity16			1
six children in @entity18 have died this year from the flu according to the state 's @entity20 and so far @entity22 has seen 442 children with flu this month			1
according to the @entity0 , data from 122 @entity39 cities shows deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline and is at the epdidemic threshold of 6.8 percent			2
the new data also reflects the fact that the number of states reporting high flu activity has risen from 13 to 22			2
the reason for the national explosion in flu numbers is this years @entity4 virus has mutated and reduced the effectiveness of the vaccine which was pre-prepared			1
about 90 percent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent @entity57 subtype , the @entity0 reported			0
another state hit hard has been @entity59 , where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year 's flu strain is particularly strong			1
worringly , the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the @entity59 @entity20 have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 percent of students have been absent in december battling the illness			1
spread : this map reveals the sweep of flu across the @entity39 with almost the entire country reporting widespread flu indeed , 17 - year - old @entity77 , a senior at @entity78 died at the @entity79 in early december from the flu			1
initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat , @entity77 deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother 's arms after being sick for one week			0
tragedy : @entity77 passed away in early december after contracting the flu despite the paramedics and best efforts , she passed away			0
indeed , earlier in december the @entity0 admitted that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain , @entity57 , seen most commonly so far this year			1
that strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations , especially in the elderly			1
' though we can not predict what will happen the rest of this flu season , it 's possible we may have a season that 's more severe than most , ' said dr. @entity103 , director of the @entity0 , at a news conferenceat the start of the month			0
@entity0 officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated			1
but it probably wo n't be as good as if the vaccine strain was a match			1
flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year			0
last winter , flu vaccine was 50 to 55 percent effective overall , which experts consider relatively good			0
among infectious diseases , flu is considered one of the nation 's leading killers			0
on average , about 24,000 @entity39 die each flu season , according to the @entity0			0
nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter 's flu season			0
ineffective : a man receives a free flu shot from a @entity129 employee during a free flu shot clinic at @entity131 on december 19 , 2014 in @entity132 , @entity133 current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus , depending on the product			1
the ingredients are selected very early in the year , based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter			0
the ingredients always include a @entity4 flu virus			1
the most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug			0
the three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003 - 2004 , 2007 - 2008 , and 2012 - 2013 — were @entity57 seasons			0
in march , after the @entity57 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway , health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of @entity57			1
' this is not something that 's been around before , ' @entity103 said			0
but health officials were n't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the @entity39 this winter until recently , they said			2
lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of @entity57			2
specifically , about 48 percent of the @entity57 samples seen so far were well matched to what 's in the vaccine , but 52 percent were not , the @entity0 said			0
an official with one vaccine manufacturer — @entity171 — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine			2
he also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain			2
' we 're at the very beginning of flu season , and it 's quite possible different strains will predominate , ' said dr. @entity185 , director of scientific affairs for @entity171 's vaccines business .			0

mutated strain of @entity4 virus has hospitalized 2,500 people *nationwide*
predominantly affects those over 65 and under 4 but also *teenagers*
