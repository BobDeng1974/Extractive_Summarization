her mouth frozen in a rictus grin and her eyes blue and staring , the new waxwork of @entity5 's eight - year - old princess @entity4 is unusual to say the least			1
and the sculptures created of her parents , @entity10 and @entity12 @entity11 , which were unveiled by the @entity14 in @entity15 this week are little better			0
while @entity10 's is without the salt and pepper beard that he has sported since the summer , @entity11 's bears little resemblance to the royal original			0
not so good : the @entity14 's sculptures bear little resemblance to @entity10 and @entity12 @entity11 @entity22 : the creepy waxwork of princess @entity4 is a world away from the angelic - looking real thing but the @entity5 royals are n't the only ones to find themselves on the receiving end of wax tributes that look little like the real thing			1
prince @entity31 , who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at @entity33 's in @entity34 , was , until recently , another victim of a royal waxwork disaster			2
not only did the sculpture boast hair that was noticeably lighter than the real @entity31 's copper hue , the wax figure also looked considerably more like @entity41 's boyfriend @entity40 than the prince			1
other bizarre royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the @entity45 that once graced @entity33 's and a bizarre rendering of the @entity31 that looked more like a @entity48 puppet than the royal himself			2
bizarre : queen @entity11 's creepy waxwork boasts staring eyes and an oddly shiny forehead not quite right : the creepy - looking wax @entity10 is missing the salt and pepper beard of the real thing family : along with @entity10 and co , the museum has made waxworks of @entity61 and @entity62 frightening : the @entity5 royals are n't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves much better : the real @entity67 is much prettier ( and far less frightening ) than her wax doppelganger is it prince @entity31 ? @entity40 ! a terrible take on @entity31 ( left ) and a @entity31 that looks more like a @entity40 doll much better : the real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks one royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the @entity12 , whose madam @entity33 's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible			1
the current version was made to coincide with the @entity81 in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 @entity84 crystals			0
another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the @entity88 and @entity89 , whose likenesses entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011			0
although the @entity88 ' smile does look slightly fixed , her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress , a copy of the blue @entity98 number worn to announce her engagement to prince @entity100			0
the current prince @entity31 is also a good one , with the royal shown looking handsome in his military fatigues			0
@entity5 's princess @entity4 , whose waxwork is enough to frighten most other girls of her age , will surely be hoping for something similar in future			2
who are they ? princess @entity110 and the @entity111 both fell victim to terrible waxworks beautiful : both the late princess @entity110 and the @entity111 are prettier on their waxworks big improvement : a new prince @entity31 sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled good effort : the @entity88 and @entity45 of @entity122 's 2011 sculptures are reasonably lifelike no problem : the queen 's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals			1

the new waxworks were unveiled by the @entity130 in @entity15
princess @entity4 , eight , appears but her *sister* @entity132 , seven , does n't
bizarre wax *figurines* bear little resemblance to the royal originals
other royals to suffer wax disasters include @entity111 and @entity67
the @entity31 is also no stranger to a bad waxwork figure
prince @entity31 's last waxwork bore a close resemblance to a @entity40 doll
