@entity0 conceded defeat in his quest for the top four and admitted this slide out of the elite will damage @entity6 in the transfer market			1
@entity0 knows he must work harder to sell @entity8 as a destination for ambitious players without the lure of a @entity13 campaign — and to keep those who might be hankering after a move , such as @entity16			1
‘ it makes it difficult , there ’s no doubt about that , ’ said the @entity6 manager			1
‘ most players want to be in the @entity13			1
they want to play at the top level of the game and if you ’re not in the @entity13 it makes it difficult for you			1
@entity6 boss @entity0 has conceded defeat in his quest for the top four @entity6 players leave the pitch after the 4 - 1 defeat against @entity37 on saturday afternoon @entity37 have won 17 of their 20 games since @entity39 in all competitions			1
that includes 12 @entity43 wins , one in the @entity13 and four @entity45 victories			1
‘ it ’s going to be a little like this until we become more stable			0
we ’ve got young players who are growing , getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again			2
we want to be in the @entity13			1
that ’s important and it is key for us			0
‘ it ’s highly unlikely this year			0
but @entity6 is a great club			1
i said that before i came into it			0
it ’s a phenomenal club that players want to play for			2
’ @entity0 starts the week seven points adrift of the @entity13 places with fourth - placed @entity61 playing tonight at @entity62			1
successive defeats against direct rivals @entity64 and @entity37 have seen him write off his top - four hopes			1
‘ i ’m a realist , ’ said the @entity6 boss			1
‘ we needed to take something from @entity37			1
if we ’d done that then our chances would have been greater			2
i would n’t expect the others to slip up , particularly @entity37 or @entity64			1
i do n’t expect them to do that			0
add to that , the sort of growing number we ’ve got unavailable i think it will make it very , very difficult with only seven games to go			0
’ @entity0 will instead prioritise the @entity45			2
it is nine years since @entity6 won the trophy but indiscipline is eating away at his options ahead of wednesday ’s quarter - final replay against @entity83			1
@entity84 had no choice but to send @entity86 off after he committed a poor tackle on @entity87 @entity88 tried to argue @entity86 's case after the defender saw red for a second bookable offence centre halves @entity86 and @entity94 are suspended , which will not help solve the defensive shambles which unfolded at the @entity97			2
@entity98 is also banned after being sent off against @entity64			0
@entity99 ruled himself out of the 4 - 1 defeat at @entity37 , complaining of an unspecified knee injury after training on the eve of the game , while @entity105 played and did not look confident about his own fitness after pulling out of @entity107 duty with a hip injury			1
after selling @entity110 last summer and starting the campaign poorly , @entity6 recovered , only to lose their impetus after beating @entity61 a month ago			2
‘ we always felt this year was going to be difficult , that was the reality of it , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ our run last year nearly brought us the title			0
we lost a world - class player and lots of other developments happened within the club			2
@entity99 ( left ) ruled himself out of the defeat after complaining of an unspecified knee injury @entity0 cites losing a ' world - class player ' like @entity110 ( right ) has made things difficult for @entity6 ‘ but it ’s frustrating that we got ourselves in a position over the last three months , very close , to then come up short in the past two games			1
i look at @entity37 and their bench , the players , the world - class players on the field with big talent and it shows the continual work we have to do			1
‘ we do n’t give up			0
we will fight right to the end			0
obviously the @entity45 is a priority for us			0
but there ’s been lots of positives from it , looking at players ’ development , seeing players grow , it ’s been good			2
‘ and , as a manager not that long in the game , it ’s been great for me up to this point , learning about the dynamics of everything			0
we can still fight and we have an obligation to represent the supporters in the last seven games , and in the @entity45 , to finish as well as we can			2
’ @entity6 will meet @entity37 again at @entity157 in the @entity45 final , if it all goes to form , and @entity160 ’s team are finishing the season in irresistible form			1
the @entity37 players celebrate @entity165 's goal during the 4 - 1 victory on saturday they have won 17 of 20 games in all competitions since @entity39 , a sequence spoiled by the aberration in the first leg against @entity171 in the @entity13			1
there are grounds for optimism at the @entity97 but @entity160 has good vibes about the future			0
‘ we have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team , ’ said the @entity37 boss			2
‘ there is something happening			0
that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other			0
' you ca n’t cheat on that			0
people smell @entity189 of course is a good basis , and defensively we are getting better			0
i think you also have to give credit to players who get less , such as @entity195			0
‘ but i am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look			0
let ’s judge at the end of the season			0
‘ we ’re on a good run and it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and urgency			0
