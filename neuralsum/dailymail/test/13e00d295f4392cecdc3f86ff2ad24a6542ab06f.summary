@entity0 lurched further to the @entity1 yesterday with a land grab to extend state control over the property market			1
the @entity7 's ' @entity6 ' plan to seize unused plots – as well as impose rent controls – shocked experts and investors			2
property analysts said the move would take @entity14 back to the ' dark days of the @entity16 '			1
sites still left idle could be compulsorily purchased for use by another developer			1
the announcement saw shares in housebuilders , including @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , fall by around 2 per cent before later recovering			0
the @entity39 describes the land grab as a ' @entity6 attack on property rights '			2
last night a spokesman said : ' developers do not generally sit on large amounts of land for long periods			2
talking about compulsory purchasing is very difficult – who makes the decisions ? ' we do n't think that a series of interventions on the demand side of the housing market are particularly helpful when the problem is we are not building enough houses			2
' pointing the way : mr @entity0 wants to bring in ' use it or lose it ' powers for councils @entity63 , @entity64 candidate for @entity65 and @entity66 , said : ' it is the sort of policy you might expect from @entity70			1
' we should encourage developers to use this land , but threatening to steal people 's land is using a stick rather than a carrot			1
' mr @entity0 's plan to link rents to inflation under new , three - year contracts came under fire too			1
@entity83 , of the @entity84 , said @entity86 's abolition of rent controls in 1988 had doubled the number of homes on the lettings market			2
' @entity7 's plans would take use back to the dark days of the @entity16 and the @entity93 which caused a shortage of decent homes to rent , ' he added			1
@entity96 , chief executive of the @entity97 , said : ' in places like @entity100 tenants will find this policy on rents may make their budgeting harder , rather than easier			2
' their rent will tick along at @entity108 inflation for a couple of years and then they will face a potential sharp rise in year three when the rent returns to market			0
' ultimately what will help tenants best is more investment in housing			0
' pension funds and other institutions have billions to invest in this market – developing places that would provide a new generation of high - quality homes that offer greater choice to renters , including the option to sign longer tenancies			0
' in it together : mr @entity0 said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home @entity133 , of the @entity134 , said @entity7 's package would make owners less likely to risk their money in providing homes while banks would be deterred from advancing loans			1
in his policy package , mr @entity0 also said he wanted to ' restore the dream of home ownership ' by giving first - time buyers a stamp duty holiday on homes up to £ 300,000 in value			1
he said up to half of new homes would be earmarked for local residents trying to get a foot on the property ladder , while higher taxes would be imposed on foreign buyers			2
mr @entity0 's housing announcements are an attempt to regain the initiative after the @entity158 unveiled a popular policy two weeks ago to extend the right to buy to all tenants of housing associations			1
the @entity7 leader said housing would be a late addition on his party 's election pledge card – increasing the number of pledges from five to six			0
mr @entity0 said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home , could save up to £ 5,000 and would cost the government £ 225million a year			2
chancellor @entity173 dismissed mr @entity0 's stamp duty pledge as a ' complete gimmick '			1
@entity176 , of @entity177 , an asset management company , said mr @entity0 's housing policy was ' a load of old cobblers '			1
' @entity7 are clearly very bad at their sums , which is why , of course , we are so worried about them running the economy , ' she said			0
' the average purchase price for a first time buyer outside @entity100 is £ 137,120 , according to the @entity189			0
following the new stamp duty reforms introduced by the conservative coalition last december , the stamp duty charge for buyers at this level is just £ 242			0
' this is what the @entity7 policy would save – not £ 5,000			0
' @entity198 , of campaign group @entity199 , said : ' these policies to cut stamp duty do nothing for affordability			0
' they merely stimulate demand and drive house prices even further out of reach of ordinary first - time buyers			0
' limiting this policy to the first two years of government is a gimmick that will only drive up prices as people scramble to buy before the ' holiday ' is over			0
' trump card : the @entity7 leader said housing would be a late addition on his party 's election pledge card – increasing the number of pledges from five to six @entity223 , of the @entity224 , said : ' slashing stamp duty could lead to even higher demand on homes for first - time buyers , pushing up prices even further out of reach , while not addressing the supply of homes we so desperately need			0
' mr @entity0 dismissed the backlash , saying : ' our proposals will be better for home owners in @entity14 and for companies building homes in @entity14			1
' we have a housing market that is frankly not working and we have government that is not unblocking the real barriers there are in the housing market			0
' mr @entity0 added : ' we wo n't let those large developers just hoard land – waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes			1
' we 'll say : either you use the land or you lose the land			0

@entity0 wants councils to encourage building by *hiking* tax on unused land
sites still left idle could be compulsorily purchased by another developer
property analysts say it would take @entity14 back to ' dark days of the @entity16 '
@entity64 candidate said it 's ' sort of policy you might expect from @entity70 '
