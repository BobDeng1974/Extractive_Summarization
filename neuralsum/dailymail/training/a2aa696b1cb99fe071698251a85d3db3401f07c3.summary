by @entity0 @entity1 should play without the weight of the nation 's expectation heavy on his shoulders when he walks out at @entity6 as defending champion next week , according to former winner @entity8			1
the 27 - year - old @entity10 returns to the @entity11 having become the first @entity13 winner since 1936 after beating @entity14			1
but @entity1 is without a tournament win since his triumph at @entity17 just under 11 months ago and suffered a shock early exit at @entity19 last week after a crushing defeat to @entity21 in the @entity23 semi-finals			1
baying crowds : becoming @entity13 's first male @entity6 winner since 1936 will reduce the pressure on @entity1 @entity1 broke down in tears when he was runner - up against @entity29 on grass two years ago , such was the sense of occasion			1
but @entity8 , @entity6 champion in 2001 after being given a wildcard entry , believes that last year 's win will see a very different player take to @entity36 on monday afternoon			1
' first of all , @entity1 will have the privilege to open the @entity38 , and he has deserved it , ' said @entity8 , who helped launch @entity40 ’s @entity39 at @entity41 on tuesday			2
new ideas : @entity1 shares a laugh with @entity44 who will hope to guide him to a second title at @entity17 ' there will be less pressure for him this time because he did it last year and deserved it last year because he was the best player over the two weeks			1
' i have no idea if he is going to win again this year but there will be much less pressure on him - he has already won @entity6 and nobody can say anything to him anymore			2
' of course if he does not win it again this year , he will be disappointed , but he can always go home and say " i am @entity6 champion " , and nobody can take that away from him			2
' frustration : @entity1 has been out of sorts since his injury problems and crashed out of @entity60 's early emotion : @entity1 finally won the tennis ' oldest tournament last year after losing in the 2012 final @entity8 , who never got the chance to defend his title at @entity17 because of injury , added : ' however , he is too good a player not to win it again , whether it will be this year or next year , who knows , but his form is picking up now after the injury			1
' already in @entity73 , he hit the ball much better and i think he is going to be ready			0
' much has been made of @entity1 ’s decision to appoint @entity44 - the former world number one and 2006 @entity6 women ’s singles champion - as his coach after parting company with @entity82			2
name on the trophy : @entity1 is fully focused on reaching peak form ahead of the defence of his title the pair only started working together after @entity1 ’s run to the semi-final of the @entity23 , where he lost to @entity21			0
it remains to be seen what the partnership will bring , with @entity1 having lost against @entity92 in his second match at the @entity38 in @entity60 ’s last week			0
@entity8 , 42 , now works as coach for compatriot @entity95 , and sees no reason why @entity44 should not make an impact on @entity1 ’s game			2
take two : @entity8 says @entity1 will definitely become @entity6 champion again - potentially this year ' it is not like @entity1 has just chosen a woman , @entity44 was a @entity102 winner , she was world number one , an amazing tennis player and is a great person , ' said @entity8 , who watched cilic play @entity106 in thursday ’s warm - up event in west @entity109			1
' if it is working , then people will be saying " well done @entity1 , what a great choice "			0
if it is not working , then they are going to give him a hard time			0
' i hope it goes well , because @entity44 is a great girl and an amazing tennis player , so we will see - i think it might work			0
' @entity8 continued : ' ( as a coach ) you do feel a bit frustrated ( from the stands ) , but you have to stay positive - if he looks at you and you make stupid faces , you do not help anybody			2
' i was a tennis player , so i know how it feels			0
i just have to be there and support him , always be positive and so far it is working well			0
' masterplan : @entity44 's coaching for the grass game could be key to @entity1 's chances , says @entity8 @entity1 is scheduled to play at @entity40 ’s @entity39 on thursday , while friday ’s action at @entity41 is also set to include world number one @entity21 , the 2014 @entity23 champion			1
@entity8 believes the competition will help fine tune preparations for the @entity11			0
' it is important for the guys to have a match , to feel the grass , because it is not the same with just practice , and this event here at @entity41 , with the crowd , it is not like a tournament , but you feel more serious and feel more pressure , ' @entity8 said			0
' the grass here is great , okay you cant get like @entity6 , but it is a perfect event			0
' passing shot : @entity1 surrendered his queen 's title against @entity156 last week in the second round			1

past winner @entity8 says @entity1 's first title will make his job easier
the @entity10 makes his return to @entity6 next week as champion
@entity1 is without a tournament win since last year 's @entity17 title
@entity8 says the @entity10 will win @entity6 again - and maybe this year
