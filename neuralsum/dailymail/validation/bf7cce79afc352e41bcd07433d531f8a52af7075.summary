a foreign mother who was jailed for stabbing her baby has been granted the right to stay in @entity3			0
the @entity5 woman , who can not be named , served five years for attempted murder in 2009 after she attacked her daughter in the midst of a marital breakdown			1

@entity20 judge @entity24 said the case was ‘ truly exceptional ’			1
he said : ' the circumstances of the offence , the bitter suffering of [ the mother ] following the offence and the clear benefit to the victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother rendered this case truly exceptional			0
' in short , despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign criminals , there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of the crime			0
' in my view , the combined circumstances of the crime and its consequences were exceptional and the @entity51 was entitled to conclude that separation , which was likely to be permanent , would be cruel both to the offender and to the victim			2
' the judge heard the appeal with @entity57 and @entity58 , who both agreed with the decision			0
