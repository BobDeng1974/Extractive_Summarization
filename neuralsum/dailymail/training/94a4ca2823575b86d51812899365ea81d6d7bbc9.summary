@entity0 has branded @entity2 supporters embroiled in the @entity4 racism furore as ' pathetic '			1
a collection of @entity7 fans were filmed making racist chants on the @entity10 underground whilst also preventing a black commuter from entering the carriage			1
and speaking ahead of @entity15 's trip to @entity16 , @entity13 has blasted the people involved in the incident			1
' it looked pathetic and dreadful , it seems we always have a recurrence of this problem , ' said @entity0			2
' we have to be severe in the punishment			0
more intelligent people than myself think about that and nobody has found a miraculous solution , it certainly starts from childhood education and an open - minded attitude			0
' there is a danger of having radical people in every society			0
since i observed youth movements , there are always certain people who are ready for radical solutions and most of the time you have to control them			0
' @entity0 added : ' i do n't think the managers agree with that kind of behaviour			2
everybody has to fight against that			0
why should you not ? there 's no reason at all			2
' you have to be 100 per cent against that			0
' @entity15 take on @entity16 at @entity68 on saturday and @entity0 confirmed that @entity69 is available after an absence of almost three months with an ankle ligament injury			1
@entity72 faces a fitness test ahead of the @entity75 match , but it has come too soon for @entity76 who has only just returned to full training and @entity78 is still around 10 days away from his return			1
