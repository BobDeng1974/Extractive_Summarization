@entity0 is relishing the challenge to @entity4 's @entity3 title this season			1
the champions lost their place at the top of the league to @entity10 on @entity11 when the @entity10 beat @entity12 2 - 0 at @entity13 before the @entity15 ' game at @entity16 later on was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch			1
with five points separating the top five sides ahead of sunday 's fixtures , the @entity19 men could find themselves further behind and in third place by the time @entity24 takes his team down to @entity26 on monday night			2
@entity4 defender @entity0 ( far left ) is looking forward to competing with @entity10 for the @entity28 title @entity0 and hos @entity4 team - mates take on @entity10 on monday before flying out to @entity30 however , the @entity4 defender believes any possible threat to their title will simply bring the best out of the @entity4 squad			1
' @entity10 are at the top and they deserve it , they are a great team and have been playing well , ' said @entity0			1
' we respect them and we look for the challenge from them			2
not just them , @entity45 , so we need to step up			0
' the best of @entity4 is going to come because we know there are teams behind us trying to take the title from us			1
' what we need to do is win every game from now until the end of the season and i believe we have the ability and the squad that can do that			2
' but it is easier said than done			0
people think it is easy for @entity4 for win the league but it is n't			1
@entity24 and his players will spend time in the @entity65 ahead of their match against @entity68 ' every team wants to beat @entity4 so that makes it difficult			1
it puts pressure on us and it is not easy			0
we have to have the character			0
' we have not been at our best , but that is football			0
' i think it will change this year			0
against @entity26 it is going to be a different @entity4 team			1
' @entity4 will fly out to @entity30 for a winter break following their first trip to @entity83 this season			2
@entity24 insists he has no problems with playing on @entity26 's artificial pitch even though he has yet to see it			0
the @entity88 said : ' i think it is much better to play on a good artificial pitch than to play on bumpy natural grass			0
' the tempo of the game is high and the ball will move very quick			2
' i have a lot of experience with artificial pitch so it is normal for me but i understand it is different for the players			0
