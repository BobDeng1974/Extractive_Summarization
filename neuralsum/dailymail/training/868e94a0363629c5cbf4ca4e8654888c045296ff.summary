by @entity1 reporter published : 10:00 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 16 february 2013 the election of a new @entity4 could start sooner than the earliest possible date of march 15 , it emerged today			0
under @entity8 rules , there is always a 15 - 20 day waiting period before @entity11 vote in a conclave after the papacy becomes vacant			1
but the announcement of pope @entity15 that he will retire on february 28 , means they will have plenty of time to get to @entity19 to take part in the election			0
' he said : ' it is possible that church authorities can prepare a proposal to be taken up by the cardinals on the first day after the papal vacancy ' to move up the start of conclave			2
rules : @entity8 spokesman @entity26 says the cardinals may accept a proposal bringing forward the election the date of the conclave 's start is important because @entity47 begins march 24 , with @entity48 followed by @entity49 on march 31			1
in order to have a new pope in place in time for the most solemn liturgical period on the church calendar , he would need to be installed as pope by sunday , march 17			0
given the tight time - frame , speculation has mounted that some sort of arrangement would be made to start the conclave earlier than a strict reading of the law would allow			0
questions about the start of the conclave have swirled ever since @entity15 announced on febraury 11 that he would retire , the first pontiff in 600 years to abdicate rather than stay in office until death			0
as a result , his decision has created a host of questions about how the @entity8 will proceed , given that its procedures for the so - called ' sede vacante ' - or vacant seat - period between papacies wo n't begin with a pope 's death			2
@entity26 also gave more details about @entity15 's final audiences and plans for retirement , saying already 35,000 people have requested tickets for his final general audience to be held in @entity85 on february 27			1
he said @entity15 would spend about two months in the papal summer retreat at @entity87 south of @entity19 immediately after his abdication , to allow enough time for renovations to be completed on his retirement home - a converted monastery inside the @entity8 walls			1
that means @entity15 would be expected to return to the @entity8 , no longer as pope , around the end of april or beginning of may , @entity26 said			1
he was asked if and when the pope would meet with his successor and whether he would participate in his installation @entity100 both issues simply have n't yet been resolved , @entity26 said .			0

@entity8 spokesman says cardinals may *agree* to *radical* proposal to bring forward the succession vote
he says rules are open to ' interpretation ' and there have been church talks
35,000 have asked for tickets to @entity15 's final audience in @entity85
