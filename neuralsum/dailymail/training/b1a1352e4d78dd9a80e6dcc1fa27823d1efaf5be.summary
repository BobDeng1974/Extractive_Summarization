@entity0 , the five - time @entity1 swimming champion , is gay			1
he came out during an emotional interview with sir @entity3 broadcast in @entity4 on sunday			1
it turns out one of the most successful blokes in @entity4 sporting history likes other blokes			1
whoever would have thought it ? i bumped into @entity0 at the @entity15 ’s @entity14 studio during @entity16			1
he was an excellent pundit — knowledgeable , respected and flamboyantly over the top in his enthusiasm			2
someone was complimenting presenter @entity20 on the handbag that was lying around the green room			2
‘ it ’s @entity0 ’s			2
the reaction to @entity0 ’s interview has been similar : overwhelmingly positive and supportive , thank goodness , but underpinned by a shrug of the shoulders			1
@entity0 has not announced his sexuality , but merely confirmed what everyone thought they knew			2
it ’s more revealing that the 31 - year - old had to wait until his competitive career was over to reveal the blindingly obvious			1
@entity0 claimed he was heterosexual as recently as his 2012 autobiography and only now , after battling depression , has he felt able to admit the truth			1
a reported £ 220,000 incentive for joining @entity4 ’s @entity45 , with the interview no doubt timed to attract maximum publicity just before the start of the @entity49 , perhaps provided the final nudge			1
it is telling , though , that this acutely personal journey has taken so long to reach its public conclusion			0
all smiles : @entity0 ( right ) revealed his sexuality in a tv interview with sir @entity3 ( left ) @entity0 told lie upon lie until the web of deceit was too tightly spun for the truth to shine through			1
‘ what happened was i felt the lie had become so big that i did n’t want people to question my integrity , ’ he said			0
‘ a little bit of ego comes into this			0
i did n’t want people to question that ... have i lied about everything ? ’ @entity0 ’s hesitance to tell the truth is understandable			2
he was only 15 when he won his first @entity73 gold medal and soon he was too famous and too deep in denials to go back on his word			0
do n’t forget , he lives in a world where an @entity4 rules commentator , @entity77 , feels able to use the phrase ‘ big poofter ’ on national television and then only offer a half - hearted apology at half - time			1
ruthless : @entity3 ( left ) did not hold back when he sat down with former @entity1 swimmer @entity83 ( right ) no holds barred ! the tell - all interview aired on sunday on @entity4 channel @entity45 our default position to describe athletes who do decide to talk about their sexuality is still to call them ‘ brave ’ or ‘ courageous ’ , simply because they are still in the overwhelming minority			1
this is lazy and slightly patronising , because the many who remain silent are not weak , they are just more private individuals			0
athletes do not have a responsibility to talk about their sexuality ; only an obligation to do their job to the best of their ability — by winning matches or medals or whatever it happens to be			0
they have to do whatever is best for them during their short careers			0
if that does not include pandering to public interest about their sexual orientation , then so be it			0
@entity109 does , however , give athletes the opportunity and the platform to discuss their sexuality if they so wish ; to become instant role models for youngsters who might be wrestling with the same feelings themselves			0
nobody is saying it will be easy , particularly for a young man or woman already dealing with the pressures of sporting fame and fortune			0
yet @entity0 turned down that chance , time and time again			2
he did not feel ready or able to seize it			0
the fact he finally has , after more than a decade as a public figure , makes it crass to simply shrug our shoulders and say ‘ so what ? ’			0
overnight , @entity0 has become @entity4 ’s most successful gay swimmer			1
or , to put it a better way , we can finally see @entity4 ’s most successful swimmer in his true light			1
a good get ! ' @entity0 has always been near the top of my list to interview , ' @entity3 said @entity139 hurdler @entity138 , 25 , provided not one but two of the best quotes of the @entity144 @entity143 this weekend			1
‘ every time i race i go out there to have fun , run @entity151 , and look fabulous ! ’ she said , adding : ‘ i think the @entity146 crowds love me because my name is @entity138			0
@entity154 ’s under 20 basketball team progressed from the group stage of the @entity156 for the first time — a huge achievement for a developing team sport shockingly bereft of elite - level funding			2
meanwhile , the government is apparently too busy handing over £ 7.5m to help set up @entity165 ’s @entity164 team to notice .			0
