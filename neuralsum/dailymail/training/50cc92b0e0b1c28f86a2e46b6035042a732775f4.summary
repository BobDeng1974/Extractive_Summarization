@entity1 took @entity13 , a 4.5lb juvenile @entity14 , from @entity16 in @entity17 after he wandered into her enclosure while drunk			1
the 18 - year - old originally tried to sell @entity13 for what she was worth , then accepted an offer of just £ 30 for the tortoise - a specimen of one of the world 's rarest species			1
police arrested @entity1 , a bricklaying student , after matching his dna to saliva on a beer can left at the scene			1
@entity1 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , has sold the tortoise to 19 - year - old @entity34 , @entity35 heard last week			1
@entity36 later posted a picture of it on @entity12 asking for name suggestions for his new pet which was spotted by a member of @entity16 staff who realised it was helpless @entity13			1
he claimed he did n't know the reptile was stolen after @entity1 had turned up at his house with her in the early hours of the morning on january 5			1
prosecuting , @entity46 said : ' it was only the fact that she was promptly recovered that she 's back to being fit and well			0
' the keeper said that when she was returned @entity13 was a muddy brown colour when she is normally beige			0
she would have died if she had n't have been returned and that would have been devastating for the park			2
' she 's from the @entity53 and they only have five of the kind at @entity16 with @entity13 being the only female and they are hoping to breed the species			0
' the court heard @entity13 was recovered following a dna match on a can of @entity7 left in the enclosure			1
@entity1 had been drinking on the evening of january 4 when he ventured into the animal park , the court heard			1
@entity64 , defending @entity1 , said : ' he decided to go out for a walk and was able to walk into the safari park			1
' once inside he stole the tortoise			0
' he 's very sorry for his actions especially as he found out she had been unwell			2
' @entity1 had no idea of the value of @entity13 , she told the court			1
@entity1 initially denied the offence when he was interviewed by police			1
he later admitted burglary of a non-dwelling and was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work			0
he was also given a curfew from 7pm to 7am , to last two months			0
magistrates told him : ' it 's a serious matter and from what we have heard you were very fortunate there were not more serious consequences			0
' it was a very stupid thing to do was n't it and you have had time to reflect on the matter			0
' in addition to the unpaid work and curfew , @entity1 was ordered to pay a £ 60 victim surcharge			2
rescued : @entity13 the 4.5lb @entity14 worth £ 2,000 who was stolen by @entity1 from @entity16 then sold for just £ 30			1
she has now been returned to her enclosure at the park the @entity99 tortoise is becoming more popular in the pet trade , although in some countries they require a permit			2
their price makes them an exclusive animal			0
@entity16 is home to five @entity99 giant tortoises , living in their own specially designed exhibit in the @entity112 section of the park			2
@entity13 , the only female at the park , is also the smallest			2
the largest of the group , four - year - old @entity118 , weighs almost 14kg			1
when he reaches adulthood , he will weigh a whopping 250kg , nearly 40st			0
@entity112 keeper @entity121 said : ' despite her size , @entity13 makes up for it in personality			0
' if you can spot her standing tall with her neck outstretched , that 's a sign she 's waiting for a tickle			0
' this breed of tortoise is normally found on the islands of the @entity134 @entity133 and , contrary to popular belief , tortoises are not slow or sluggish reptiles ; they can in fact move quite quickly			2
@entity99 tortoises are classed as ' vulnerable ' in the wild			0
this means their numbers are in decline due to habitat loss , hunting and also from predatory species introduced into their habitats , such as dogs and rats			0
the tortoises at @entity16 will be part of a significant captive breeding programme , which will help secure the future of the species .			0
