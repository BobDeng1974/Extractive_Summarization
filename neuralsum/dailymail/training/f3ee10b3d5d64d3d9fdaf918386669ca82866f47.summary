by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 6 september 2013 @entity1 faced demands to quit or be sacked last night as civil war tore through the @entity4			1
the chairman of the @entity6 was given an ultimatum after being accused of ‘ fundamentally misleading ’ @entity8 over the scandal of excessive pay - offs to @entity12 fat cats			0
but the defiant former @entity14 chairman said he had ‘ no concerns ’ about the allegations made by former director general @entity17			1
quit or be sacked : the chairman of the @entity19 , left , was given an ultimatum after being accused of ‘ fundamentally misleading ’ @entity8 over the scandal of excessive pay - offs to @entity12 fat cats by former director general @entity17 , right mr @entity17 has sent a dossier to mps as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the @entity4 ’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives @entity28 and @entity30			1
in it , he suggests that @entity1 was briefed on the pay - offs shortly after taking over as chairman from sir @entity34 in 2011			2
but in july this year @entity1 said he ‘ did n’t know ’ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to mps			2
both men now face a showdown before the influential public accounts committee on monday			0
@entity43 mp @entity42 said they were ‘ fighting like ferrets in a sack ’			0
yesterday mr @entity42 said the chairman and three other senior @entity4 figures should ‘ resign immediately or be sacked ’ if they were shown to have misled @entity8			2
denial : in july this year @entity1 said he ¿ didn ¿ t know ¿ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to mps he said @entity1 , human resources chief @entity54 , @entity6 director @entity55 and trustee @entity56 had all been accused of ‘ re-writing history ’ by mr @entity17 over the severance payments scandal			1
mr @entity42 said : ‘ they must all be required to answer each of the accusations mr @entity17 has made against them			1
if they or anyone else is found to have done so without a proper excuse , they will have endangered the integrity and honesty expected of the @entity4 and must resign immediately or be sacked			0
’ as the row intensified , former culture secretary @entity68 declared that the @entity6 should be scrapped			0
and in a further twist , miss @entity54 – who is quitting as head of @entity71 after signing off multiple big pay - offs to senior managers – confessed that her own evidence to the committee had been ‘ mistaken ’			0
controversy : mr @entity17 has sent a dossier to mps as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the @entity4 ’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives @entity28 , left , and @entity30 , right mr @entity17 hit out at @entity1 in a 25 - page submission ahead of his committee appearance next week			1
‘ the picture painted for the pac by @entity6 witnesses on july 10 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of @entity6 knowledge and involvement , ’ mr @entity17 claimed			1
‘ the insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence			0
here is what @entity1 and @entity17 have said so far about whether the @entity6 was aware of payments of £ 1million to departing deputy director general @entity28 and £ 394,000 to former marketing director @entity30 : @entity1 : at the public accounts committee , on july 10 , chairman @entity105 asked him : ‘ should the @entity6 have known ? [ about payments exceeding contractual obligations ] ’ lord @entity1 : ‘ yes , and if you call a previous director general of the @entity4 in due course , i will be as interested as you in why we did n’t know			1
’ speaking yesterday he added : ‘ i ’m obviously going to save my remarks principally until i appear in front of the committee on monday , which i ’m looking forward to			0
' i have no concerns at all about the remarks mr @entity17 has made			1
’ @entity17 : in his written submission to mps , he says : ‘ @entity1 was fully briefed , in writing as well as orally , about the @entity28 and @entity30 settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011			1
‘ a detailed briefing on the settlements was prepared for @entity1 and myself to prepare us for questions from the press and parliamentarians on the two cases			2
' the settlements also came up in a series of preparatory meetings and rehearsals which @entity1 and i both attended			2
’ mr @entity17 also encloses a briefing note which he says @entity1 was given shortly after arriving as @entity6 chairman in 2011			1
it sets out questions the @entity4 might be asked about the sums given to mr @entity28 and @entity144 , and suggests ways to justify the payments			0
the note appears to give ammunition to both sides			0
in one answer , it describes the sums as ‘ contractual payments ’ , which will be helpful to @entity1 because he claims the trust was unaware of any ‘ extra- contractual payments ’			2
but in another answer , the note says @entity144 ‘ received ... payment for notice , a redundancy payment ... and an additional compensation payment ’ , which lends weight to mr @entity17 ’s assertion that it was made clear there was money on top of what the @entity4 was contractually obliged to pay			1
‘ @entity1 was fully briefed , in writing as well as orally , about the @entity28 and @entity30 settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011			2
’ mr @entity17 has included a copy of the 2011 briefing note with his evidence			1
he added : ‘ two years later [ @entity1 ] would claim he felt “ shock and dismay ” but in july 2011 he did not raise the topic of senior manager severance at all			0
’ @entity1 has denied misleading the committee and has branded mr @entity17 ’s submissions ‘ bizarre ’			1
he said yesterday that he was relishing the chance to return to the committee , but would save his comments until then			0
‘ i have no concerns at all about the remarks mr @entity17 has made , ’ he said			1
on july 10 miss @entity54 told the public accounts committee she had not seen a crucial note detailing plans for pay - offs – but now she admits she not only saw it but helped write it			0
her ‘ clarification ’ was published after mr @entity17 branded her evidence ‘ inexplicable ’ because she had been one of the ‘ main authors ’ of a 2010 note			1
it set out how £ 1million of licence fee payers ’ money should be lavished on a ‘ golden goodbye ’ to departing deputy director general mr @entity28 and a further £ 394,000 to former director of marketing miss @entity30			1
their pay - offs were among a string of lucrative severance deals in which £ 25million was paid to departing @entity4 staff from 2009 to 2012			0
@entity4 bosses past and present are now locked in a bitter war of words over who knew what and when			0
the astonishing sum was uncovered by the @entity210			0
mr @entity42 said it was not enough for the @entity6 to dismiss the allegations as ‘ bizarre ’ , adding : ‘ the evidence of mr @entity17 has blown a hole in @entity1 ’s argument that the @entity6 was only responsible for “ strategy ” and had no operational involvement in executive pay - offs			1
‘ he [ @entity1 ] must urgently shore up confidence in his position and he can only do so by answering each of the specific allegations made by @entity17			2
the cloud gathering over his position will only darken if he fails to do so			0
’ but he said the stakes were also high for mr @entity17 , who is now the boss of the @entity225			2
he said : ‘ if mr @entity17 ’s allegations are found to be wrong or untruthful , i believe his position as chief executive of the @entity225 would be untenable			1
' it is not altogether surprising that @entity17 and @entity230 are fighting like ferrets in a sack			0
' as the light has been shone into the dark corners of the @entity4 , people with questions to answer have begun to mount campaigns to save their own skin			0
' they ’ve been caught out and it ’s now become every senior executive for himself			0
’ @entity242 , who was chairman of the executive board remuneration committee , backed mr @entity17 ’s version of events			2
but in a statement , five @entity4 trustees poured scorn on mr @entity17 ’s claims that ‘ multiple documents establish ’ that details of the pay - offs were disclosed to the trust before settlements were approved			2
' @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity56 , @entity257 and @entity258 said : ‘ we were not asked for approval of [ mr @entity28 ’s ] financial package – formally or informally – nor did we give it			0
