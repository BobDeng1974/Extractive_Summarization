some of the greatest figures in @entity2 ’s past are to be restored to their rightful place in history , thanks to an overhaul of the school curriculum			1
the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 had been dropped from history lessons under the last @entity14 in a move critics said was driven by ‘ political correctness ’			1
but under a new ‘ back - to - basics ’ shake - up , pupils will again have to study these traditional historic figures – and not social reformers such as @entity23 - born nurse @entity22 and former black slave @entity24 , who were introduced into the 2007 curriculum			1
the revisions , spearheaded by @entity28 education secretary @entity27 , are certain to anger equality activists who believe history lessons are too skewed towards white @entity2 men			1
but they have been welcomed by traditionalists such as @entity36 mp @entity35 , who said : ‘ the curriculum has to specify figures like @entity11 and @entity39			1
‘ far too often we are apologising for things in our past , but actually we have so much in our history to be proud of			0
it is essential that children learn why they should be proud of their country			0
’ and former @entity14 history adviser @entity47 said teachers needed guidelines to teach about the key figures who shaped our past , saying : ‘ many teachers are more concerned to promote politically correct social themes than to present a narrative			1
’ leaked drafts of the new history curriculum , to be published in the @entity57 , show that schools will be required to cover the @entity59 , @entity60 and his conflict with the archbishop of canterbury @entity62 , and @entity65 and his power struggles with the @entity66 that resulted in the @entity67			0
episodes such as the @entity69 , the @entity70 , the growth of the @entity72 and the trial and execution of @entity75 i will also be included , as will the @entity77 – which will become the subject of scrutiny as @entity80 holds a referendum on independence in 2014			0
but out go figures including social reformers @entity84 and @entity86 , aviator @entity87 , nurse @entity88 , and @entity24 and his fellow anti-slavery campaigner @entity89			1
reform : education secretary @entity27 has spearheaded the ' back - to - basics ; curriculum reform			1
last year , mr @entity27 said that too many children were leaving school ignorant about @entity2 's past because syllabuses had been stripped of core content however , pupils will still have to learn about social changes such as the abolition of slavery and the suffragettes			2
in addition , references to cultural , ethnic and religious diversity have been cut , although they will still be taught about immigration			0
the changes have been drawn up amid great secrecy by @entity14 advisers , including television historian @entity111			0
mr @entity27 said a year ago that too many children were leaving school ignorant about @entity2 ’s past because syllabuses had been stripped of core content			2
he pointed to a survey which found a sixth of 18 - to 24 - year - olds believed @entity10 , rather than @entity11 , led the @entity2 fleet at @entity119			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ i am genuinely worried that – despite the best efforts of brilliant history teachers , gifted academics and the television and publishing executives who ’ve helped to popularise history – our curriculum and examinations system mean that children thirsting to know more about our past leave school woefully undernourished			2
’ mr @entity27 has also criticised the existing curriculum for focusing on certain periods such as the @entity134 and the world wars while missing out large chunks of the past			2
the national curriculum sets out the minimum that should be taught in schools , but it does not prevent teachers adding any material they wish to flesh out lessons – including events and individuals that have been cut out of the new version			0
however , they will have to ensure they first cover all the areas specified in the new curriculum			0
the national curriculum is compulsory only in maintained state schools ; academies and free schools can create their own versions			0
the @entity156 said : ‘ we do not comment on leaks			0

historic figures , including @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity11 will again feature in history lessons
the ' back - to - basics ' shakeup will see overhaul of social reformers like @entity23 - born nurse @entity22
