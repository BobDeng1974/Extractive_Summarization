we are always being told that being overweight is unhealthy			0
but new research suggests it could be good for you - if you 're over 65			0
an @entity4 study shows that older people with a higher body mass index liver for longer			1
elderly people who are overweight live for longer than those who are a ' healthy ' weight scientists at @entity13 , in @entity11 , found people over the age of 65 who fell into the overweight category of @entity18 were least likely to die			1
they found that the lowest risk of death was among those with a @entity18 of about 27.5 , which is considered overweight according to the @entity22			1
they also found that mortality rates were much higher among those with a @entity18 between 22 and 23 – this is within the normal range			2
‘ it is time to reassess the healthy weight guidelines for older people , ’ lead author professor @entity28 said			1
‘ our results showed that those over the age of 65 with a @entity18 of between 23 and 33 lived longer , indicating that the ideal body weight for older people is significantly higher than the recommended 18.5 to 25 “ normal ” healthy weight range			1
’ the research team reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2013 that reported on @entity18 and risk of death in people aged 65 years and over			2
elderly people with a @entity18 of 27.5 - which is classed as overweight - live the longest collectively these studies followed around 200,000 people over an average of 12 years			1
the results showed that people with a ‘ normal ’ @entity18 of 21 to 22 were 12 per cent more likely to die			2
they also revealed that people with a @entity18 of 20 to 20.9 were 19 per cent more likely to die and people with a @entity18 of 33 to 33.9 , which is classed as obese , were eight per cent more likely to die			0
professor @entity28 suggests that most older people need to get off the weight loss bandwagon			2
she said : ‘ these findings indicate that , by current standards , being overweight is not associated with an increased risk of dying			0
‘ rather , it is those sitting at the lower end of the normal range that need to be monitored , as older people with @entity59 less than 23 are at increased risk of dying			1
’ advice on ideal body weight should take into account factors other than @entity18 , professor @entity28 said			0
‘ factors such as chronic diseases and the ability to move around need to be considered as there is no real issue with being in the overweight range unless it is preventing people from moving around freely , ’ she added			0
‘ rather than focussing on weight loss , older people should put their efforts into having a balanced diet , eating when hungry and keeping active			0
‘ putting too much emphasis on dietary restrictions also increases the risk malnutrition in this age group			0
@entity79 in older people is not well recognised as this can occur even when @entity18 is in the overweight range			1
’ the study was published in @entity82 .			0

older people with a higher body mass index live for longer
elderly people with a @entity18 of 27.5 live for the longest
over *65s* with a ' normal ' @entity18 live for less time than *fatter* people
this could be because older people are at *greater* risk of malnutrition
