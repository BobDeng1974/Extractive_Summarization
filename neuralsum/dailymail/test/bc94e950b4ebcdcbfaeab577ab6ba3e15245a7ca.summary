they vanished from the @entity1 around 40,000 years ago after surviving for hundreds of thousands of years through much of the last ice age			0
now researchers believe they may have uncovered a possible explanation of what may have contributed to @entity7 eventual demise - they were not very adept at controlling fire			1
a team of archaeologists at @entity11 and the @entity12 believe this would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from @entity15			1
neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the @entity18 in @entity19 , may have finally died out as they were unable to get as much energy from their food as modern humans who used fire they used computer model the amount of energy @entity7 would have been able to get from their food without cooking it compared to humans that were			1
they found that without fire , a group of @entity7 would have had less energy - the equivalent 12 reindeer a year - than if they did			1
they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity7 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains			0
. instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			0
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding @entity7 and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			2
many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity7			2
neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery			0
eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity7 site in @entity61 in @entity62 were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago			2
modern humans who regularly cooked their food could have then channeled this extra energy into growing their population and searching longer for food during lean periods			1
@entity71 , an archaeologist at @entity11 who led the research , said : ' cooking makes meat more easily digestible , and that means that the calories that would 've been used to digest raw meat can go to other uses			0
' i determined , importantly , that a diet of cooked meat meant that either foraging groups could travel a bit farther in their range of gathering , or since they were getting more out of a set of resources , they could stay longer in the same landscape			0
' living from about 300,000 years ago to 40,000 years ago , they were known to make stone tools and were accomplished hunters			0
they spread through out @entity93 and much of @entity94 , and there is some evidence that they made jewellery and art. some researchers believe that they were also highly intelligent - possibly even as intelligent as modern humans , homo sapiens			1
there are a number of theories for what caused @entity7 to disappear - but most seem to agree it was the arrival of modern humans in @entity93 and @entity94 that played a role			1
some archaeologists believe they were unable to compete with modern humans , while others believe humans actively killed them			1
neanderthals vanished relatively quickly once modern humans arrived in the areas where they were living however , dna evidence also suggests that @entity7 and modern humans also interbred			1
@entity7 use of fire is still a highly controversial issue , but if they had not used it to cook food as much as modern humans it would have put them at a definite disadvantage			1
miss @entity71 said : ' there is certainly plenty of evidence that @entity7 used fire in @entity93 as well as in the @entity132 , @entity15 , and elsewhere			2
' i was absolutely not suggesting that @entity7 had no use or control of fire			2
what we do n't know is how intensively the populations used fire			0
' what is an intriguing problem is the seeming lack of consistent fire use in the @entity145 , a glacial phase of the @entity147			0
' we see a bit of burned bone at some sites , but really no evidence for lots of fire use			0
it may be that we have n't found it yet , or it may be that @entity7 were using other survival strategies			2
' @entity7 probably were n't all that different from humans , but they may have adopted different strategies for dealing with their environment			2
' miss @entity71 , who conducted her research with @entity160 , a mathematical biologist at the @entity161 , suggests that with their bigger bodies , @entity7 would have needed more food than modern humans			1
recent research is suggesting that @entity7 were sophisticated and not very different from modern humans , increasing the mystery behind why they died out and homo sapiens managed to survive she said : ' my real aim was to specifically look at the impact of cooking on metabolism , and whether regular cooking of food might have been an advantage for @entity7			1
' neanderthals were a bit more muscular and robust than early humans			0
@entity7 metabolic costs for a day 's activity would have been a bit higher			0
' using their computer models they were able to simulate how the populations of @entity7 would change depending on their use of fire			1
they found that if modern humans used fire more often than @entity7 , then their populations would grow			1
both groups hunted and ate reindeer , among other large prey , that were prevalanet across much of @entity93 at the time			0
but as modern human populations grew , it would also reduce the number of reindeer available for @entity7			1
over time this could have increased @entity7 vulnerability to extinction			2
miss @entity71 presented her findings at the @entity203 of the @entity204 in @entity205			0
she said : ' initial tests indimcate that cooking lean meat increases its caloric value sufficiently to offset up to 3.7 days â€™ worth of locomotion , or 12 kills per year , thus extending the carrying capacity of a landscape patch , particularly during periods of resource scarcity			0
' she told @entity215 : ' fire use would have provided a significant advantage for the human population and may indeed have been an important factor in the overall collapse or absorption of the @entity7 population			0

researchers used computer models to study how neanderthal populations would have fared if they did not use fire to cook and modern humans did
they found cooking would have increased the number of calories available
evidence for @entity7 using fire is patchy and not all may have done it
