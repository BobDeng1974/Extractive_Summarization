traumatic : @entity6 ( right ) , 39 , attempted desperately to revive his ten - year - old son @entity7 ( left ) after the boy began gasping for breath whilst watching tv at home in @entity25 , @entity26 brothers : the tragedy occurred when @entity6 , @entity7 ( right ) and his other son @entity29 ( left ) , now three , had been watching tv after enjoying hot dogs bought from the supermarket although ambulance staff quickly arrived at the scene , one of the paramedics found she could not insert an endotracheal tube meant to clear his airways			1
mr @entity6 , 39 , a mechanical engineer , said : ‘ the paramedic could n’t get the tube in			1
she could n’t understand why , she was shaking and she started to cry			2
’ at this point @entity7 ’s lips started to turn blue – forcing his terrified father to take charge and clear his son ’s airways himself			1
' devastated ' : @entity7 's mother @entity46 at the inquest into his death at @entity49 improvising with a vacuum cleaner he inserted the nozzle down his airway in a last - ditch attempt to try and save his son			1
he told the hearing : ‘ i suggested using a vacuum cleaner to clear his airways			1
@entity7 was occasionally gasping for breaths			1
‘ i managed to clear the airways by putting my hand down his throat and i carefully controlled the vacuum nozzle			1
’ the paramedics were still having trouble assembling their equipment , so mr @entity6 picked his son up and carried him to the ambulance waiting outside			1
he said : ‘ i remember the paramedics trying to do something with the intervention tube			2
‘ i carried @entity7 to the ambulance , but they struggled to find a vein and were having difficulties assembling the suction pump			1
’ he added : ‘ i went in to the ambulance , but none of the ambulance crew took over and they let me carry on			2
’ the paramedics eventually stepped in and rushed @entity7 to hospital , but he was pronounced dead 50 minutes later after suffering both cardiac and respiratory arrest			1
the inquest also heard that days before @entity7 ’s death he had been admitted to hospital after having a serious asthma attack – but doctors had decided to discharge him without making any changes to his prescription			1
in the lead - up to his death he had been taken in for treatment in october and december 2010 , as well as january , february , march and july 2011			2
on october 15 2011 he was sent to @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity26 , after he started struggling to breathe			1
but mr @entity6 said the family had been ‘ fobbed off ’ by doctors who sent him home following a two - day stay without making any changes to his medication			1
pronounced dead : the @entity101 at the @entity102 where @entity7 died he insisted that hospital staff had ignored changes in his son ’s condition , adding : ‘ the treatment @entity7 received clearly was n’t working			1
‘ we asked for treatment reviews several times over the years but we were told that he was on the maximum dosage and could n’t try anything else			0

asthma affects the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs			0
anything that irritates sufferers ’ airways causes the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten so they become narrower			2
this sees the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and start to swell			2
sticky mucus or phlegm can also builds up on occasions , which makes the airways even more narrow			2
this can cause the airways to become irritated , making it harder to breathe			2

‘ he received two nebulisers and another dilator to improve the wheezing			0
' he responded well and the decision was made to keep him in for two nights			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 told me at the time that he had not been taking his inhaler regularly			1
i told him that it was important as a preventative treatment			0
‘ we were cautious in discharging him			0
we do n’t discharge children and not see them again			0
' he would have been seen by another doctor in one month			0
’ the hearing was told how @entity7 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , had been born six weeks premature and was diagnosed with asthma when he was just six months old			1
