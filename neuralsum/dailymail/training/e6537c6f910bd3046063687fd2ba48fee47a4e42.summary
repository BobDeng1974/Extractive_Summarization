by @entity0 for @entity1 he 's the @entity2 aid worker who gave up a lucrative business as an electrician in @entity5 to save children from the sex trade across @entity8			1
in just over 10 years , @entity11 , 43 , has overseen the rescue of more than 2000 people from sex slavery and human trafficking , most of whom are placed in care programs by his charity , @entity17			1
even though they have successfully removed up to 100 children from brothels and dozens more from slavery - he 's far from satisfied			1
he believes his teams around @entity8 will rescue upwards of 800 children from child sex slavery this year ' we 're a lot better than we were and we are always finding quicker ways to get the kids out of horrific situations , ' said mr @entity11 , who now is based in @entity32			1
' it 's not an easy process , it 's not as simple as walking in there taking a child by the hand and walking out , unfortunately			2
' he says the involvement of families and planning what to do for the young boys and girls going forward , is all part of an often tricky process			0
@entity11 's goal is to remove at least 800 children from sex slavery and prostitution this calendar year ' we are finding quicker ways to get the kids out of horrific situations ' says @entity17 founder @entity11 destiny rescue team members are now directly involved in raids by anti-trafficking police across several parts of @entity8 , leading to the arrest of brothel owners and the closure of their businesses			1
' our vision is to end child slavery in our lifetime			2
if we want to change that , we need more people to come on board			0
' currently they focus primarily on @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity32 and @entity73 but the plan ( see graph ) is to extend the program , with clear goals set			1
children they 've removed from predators have been as young as five			0
offices are expected in @entity82 within the next two years			0
countries in orange are where @entity17 is currently in operation , those highlighted in grey are some of those planned to be established by 2019			2
up to half a million children are believed to be exploited in @entity89 alone and reportedly more than 3 million people are enslaved in @entity82 his colleagues tell how @entity11 's grand plan is a triumph of the human spirit but he says it had its beginnings from a very spiritual moment			1
' one day i had lunch with a mate of mine and , for whatever reason , we got all deep and meaningful , ' he said			0
' for me , it was a real @entity106 moment and the first time i thought i had to be hands on			0
' the challenge after children are removed from their captors is to reunite them with family and reintegrate them with their community through education and employment programs a trip to @entity71 with his father ' opened my eyes ' to the overwhelming level of poverty			1
he and his young family packed up and made the move to @entity32 where he and his wife volunteered at a mission			2
while there , they were told a story by a man who 'd been visiting @entity131 and was openly offered very young children for sex for $ 400			1
that was the moment , according to @entity11			2
' it really hit me and i knew i had to do something , ' he said and so began @entity17			2
@entity11 plans to have @entity17 operations in place in several more locations within the next two years one of @entity17 's recent success stories has been @entity141 , who was 15 when removed from her @entity71 village			1
@entity141 , an only child , was raped at knife - point in her family home			0
her parents approached the village chief , only to find out her attacker had bribed the town leader and no action would be taken			0
worse , to try and make the problem go away , villagers insisted that she should marry her attacker			0
' out of shame to her family , @entity141 tried to commit suicide , ' mr @entity11 added			1
' her family were destitute but her aunty had heard about @entity17 and asked us to help			0
' she did n't want to leave but had little option			0
' it 's not an easy process , it 's not as simple as walking in there taking a child by the hand and walking out , unfortunately ' @entity11 says a detailed plan is needed before and after a person is rescued ' we help rescue the sexually exploited and enslaved , restore the abused , protect the vulnerable , empower the poor and are a voice for children that ca nâ€™t speak up for themselves , ' says @entity17 president , @entity11 many of those saved by @entity17 have gone on to start their own businesses ' three years on , she has finished her @entity177 language studies , completed a course at sewing school and is married			1
' @entity141 now has a small sewing business in @entity181 and employs four other ' @entity17 ' girls			0
' when i was in my village i was a nasty , angry girl , and @entity17 has taught me about a lot of things , ' @entity141 said			0
' it has taught me how to talk , how to be strong and respect			0
' other girls should know that can face their problems , to stand up , be strong			0
' the @entity192 reports that ' every country in the world is affected by human trafficking , whether as a country of origin , transit or destination for victims ' mr @entity11 says the reasons for children being sold into slavery or taken into prostitution are varied , ranging from poverty to gambling problems , as well as a lack of education or abuse at home			1
identifying and then removing the child is just the first phase of the @entity17 operation , ' the challenge after that is trying to give them some semblance of a normal life '			2
@entity17 is setting a goal of 100,000 rescued children by 2020			1
