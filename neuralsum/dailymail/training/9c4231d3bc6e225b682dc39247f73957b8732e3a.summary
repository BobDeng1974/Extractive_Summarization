by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the moment a bungling driver got his 45ft - long lorry stuck between a pub and a cafe after blindly following directions from his sat nav			1
the vehicle and its driver were stuck in the narrow bend for half - an - hour until police removed fencing from the pub 's beer garden to make room			1
the lorry was on its way to a @entity19 dairy factory when it became stuck in the road in @entity22 , @entity23			1
the lorry and its driver became stuck between the @entity25 and @entity27 's @entity26 in @entity22 @entity28 , landlord of the @entity30 pub , watched the man try to drive into the narrow street without any knowledge of how tight the space was			1
' i was in my garden having a coffee when i saw the lorry trying to turn			2
' it was a 45 - foot wagon and the driver tried to take the corner and in the end became totally stuck			2
' we were shouting at the driver to stop but i do n’t think he spoke very good @entity45			0
' i had to call the police because he had blocked the road , and he was there for about 30 minutes or so while they worked to unblock him			0
' mr @entity28 said he had seen lots of trucks and lorries try to trying to make the turn before , but none had ever become lodged in between his pub and the cafe across the road			2
it was the first time anyone had become stuck in narrow bend , said pub landlord @entity28 ' we do see a lot of trucks trying to turn down here and it is very tight , really too tight for that kind of vehicle			1
' ' ideally we could do with stopping lorries turning down here , but i ’m not sure how we can do that			0
' on saying that this is the first time i have seen a lorry get wedged here , and well that ’s sat navs for you			0
' @entity75 who owns @entity27 's @entity26 said : ' @entity76 was certainly no help to this driver looking for @entity79			1
' the front of the shop here is glass fronted and he must have only been about three inches away from that , it was very close			0
' we do get articulated lorries coming down here , but to be honest they usually do n’t try and turn in like this chap did			0

the lorry became lodged between @entity25 and @entity27 's @entity26
police were forced to remove fencing from the pub 's beer garden to free driver from *cab*
