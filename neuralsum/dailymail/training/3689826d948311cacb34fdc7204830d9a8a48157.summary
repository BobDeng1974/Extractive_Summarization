anyone who played 2011 ’s @entity1 will know that it was one of the year ’s stand - out games			2
and @entity4 is no different – proudly sticking to its @entity6 side - scrolling roots to provide the most polished @entity8 experience to date			1
this is platform gaming at its absolute best – sprinting , swimming and swinging your way through gloriously - detailed worlds – dying often but not stopping until each level ’s complete			0
dynamic : it may be a side - scrolling platformer , but every little detail of each level is teeming with life and how beautiful those intricate levels are – ranging from ocean depths to murky swamps and beyond			1
they all feel that they belong to @entity8 's world - oozing charm and character seldom seen in other platforming games			0
add to the mix a quite magical soundtrack and every level becomes as memorable as the last – especially the musical stages unlocked at the end of each world ( which are best left a surprise )			1
@entity36 takes on a more active role than he did in @entity38 , helping our hero by cutting ropes , moving platforms and pocking monsters in eye			2
clearly designed with the @entity46 in mind , it ’s not quite as smooth on the @entity48 and @entity49 – and although @entity50 positions himself next to objects of interest to counter this , during harder levels it becomes incredibly challenging			1
but this is but a slight blip in a game where even the ingenious loading screens ( where @entity8 must try and collect a bonus heart ) stand head and shoulders above most games of recent years			0
in an age of muti - layered gameplay and an obsession with graphical fidelity , legends is proof that keeping things simple pays dividends			2
challenging : you 'll die many times in @entity4 , but its charm will have you coming back for more @entity73 is out now			0
agree with @entity74 ? follow us on @entity76 : @ @entity77 and on @entity78 : @entity79 .			0

beautiful , hand - *painting* - looking graphics
*traditional* side - scrolling gameplay honed to *perfection*
musical stages will put a smile on your face
controlling @entity36 on @entity48 and @entity49 takes some getting used to
