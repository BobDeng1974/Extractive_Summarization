' very bitter ' : @entity0 and @entity1 want the names of @entity4 reviewers made public the owners of a @entity7 b&b last night accused @entity4 of operating ‘ above the law ’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide			1
@entity0 and @entity1 went to court in an attempt to force the £ 3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors			1
the @entity20 , who run the nine - bedroom @entity22 na @entity25 guest house at @entity26 , @entity27 , maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious			1
they wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments , claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business			1
but their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle yesterday when a judge at the @entity43 in @entity44 rejected a request for a disclosure order to force @entity4 to reveal the names , addresses and other information on the authors ’ identity			1
in a judgment that could have far - reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews , judge @entity52 , @entity53 , ruled @entity7 courts have no jurisdiction in the matter			2
an angry mr @entity61 , 55 , said the ruling would allow @entity4 ’s army of unverified reviewers free rein to post ‘ anything on any pub , restaurant , guesthouse or hotel in the world and , frankly , get away with it ’			1
he added : ‘ this effectively means that @entity4 will continue to have a licence to defame and libel with impunity			1
my wife and i feel very bitter about it			0
’ in their petition , the @entity20 maintained that the disputed postings purported to review events that did not take place , were not submitted by actual travellers and were not posted contemporaneously			2
both writers claimed to have visited the premises in september 2011 , but the reviews did not appear until february and march the following year			2
at an earlier hearing , @entity86 , counsel for the @entity20 , told the court they were applying to seek assistance from the company over the identity of the two individuals named in the reviews as ‘ @entity94 ’ and ‘ dreckit ’			1
but , the court heard @entity4 , whose headquarters are in @entity97 , @entity98 , set out in its terms and conditions that users agreed that all claims against it arising from the site must be heard in the @entity106 state			1
@entity107 : the owners of the nine - bedroomed @entity25 guest house in @entity27 insist they were the victims of ' fabricated and malicious ' reviews on @entity4 the judge was told that mr @entity61 accepted that he had ticked a box acknowledging that he agreed with those terms and conditions in the course of his use of the website			1
he said that the legislation under which the disclosure order was sought ‘ does not empower the @entity43 with worldwide jurisdiction to ordain persons such as the respondents [ @entity4 ] to produce information ’			2
the judge added : ‘ i conclude that the approach contended for on behalf of the petitioners would require the court in turn to make a rather alarming entirely global assertion of jurisdiction			0
’ speaking after the ruling , mr @entity61 said : ‘ it seems this company can effectively do what it wants in the @entity134 – it ’s above the law			2
’ he added the upset caused by the case had prompted him and his 50 - year - old wife to try to sell the @entity139			0
though considering their position over an appeal , mr @entity61 said : ‘ i do n’t think we can go any further from here because it will just go on and on and i am not prepared to fork out another sizeable amount of money			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said it did not comment on individual cases of litigation but insisted it took fraud seriously			2
he said : ‘ every single review goes through our tracking system , which maps the how , what , where and when of each review , and we use sophisticated automated tools and algorithms to spot patterns of unusual activity			0
we back that up with a team of over 200 content specialists , who work 24/7 to maintain the quality of our reviews			0
’ since it was founded by entrepreneur @entity168 only 14 years ago , @entity4 has grown into the world ’s largest travel website and one of the most controversial			1
with more than 200 million visitors a month worldwide trusting its recommendations to book trips , a run of good or bad reviews can potentially make or break a business			0
but there are consistent grumbles that the website is growing too powerful and its system of unverified reviews is too open to abuse			0
three years ago , the @entity184 began an investigation into the firm before ordering it to remove its slogan ‘ reviews you can trust ’ and banning it from claiming reviews are from ‘ real ’ travellers			0
in 2012 , a new link was established with @entity195 allowing users to see reviews written by members on their ‘ friends ’ list			0
as a result , a previously anonymous user was exposed as @entity203 , a hotel executive , who had posted glowing reviews about his firm ’s properties			2
the same year , @entity207 , a reputation - management company , deliberately submitted three fake reviews for a defunct restaurant			0
just over a month later , the reviews were still on the site and the restaurant had risen to 17th best in @entity213			0
also in 2012 , @entity214 , a marketing manager from @entity215 , was ordered to apologise as part of a police caution for harassment after posting 30 false and malicious reviews about a vegan restaurant , @entity221 , on @entity4			1
she admitted : ‘ i made these comments based on absolutely no knowledge of the business , or any of the company ’s staff , as i have never actually visited or eaten at the restaurant			0
’ last year , fresh doubts about the global giant ’s fraud detection system , based on anti-credit card and insurance fraud algorithms , were raised after a non – existent business briefly became one of the most highly rated restaurants in @entity237 , @entity238			0
a @entity4 spokesman said every one of the 60 reviews posted every minute was checked using the system , but added : ‘ no system , verified or not , is perfect , and we are continually working to stay ahead of those attempting to cheat the system			1
