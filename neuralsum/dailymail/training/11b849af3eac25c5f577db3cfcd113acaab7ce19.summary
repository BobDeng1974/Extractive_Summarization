a man who has been unable to smell properly for 20 years sniffed out a major gas leak just days after a kick to the head during a rugby match restored his lost sense			1
@entity7 's ability to smell gradually deteriorated throughout his adult life after he repeatedly broke his nose playing his favourite sport			1
he has even undergone surgery to fix the problem , without success			0
during a recent game of rugby , he received a kick to the face which left him with another bruised and bloody nose			1
incredibly , after the swelling went down , he realised he was able to breathe properly and that his sense of smell had been restored			1
he immediately called the gas board and engineers rushed out to seal off part of the residential road and fix the leak			2
mr @entity7 said : ' although i have n't been able to smell gas for years , i still recognised the pungent smell straight away			1
' the leak was in a built - up area with a school and nursery just yards away so the guy who kicked me in the face potentially saved a serious situation			1
' mr @entity7 said he first broke his nose at the age of 14 and then on frequent occasions over the next 25 years			0
eventually he could n't inhale properly through his nose and his ability to sniff scents and odors completely faded			2
mr @entity7 ( third from left ) gradually lost his sense of smell after repeatedly breaking his nose playing rugby he said the player who kicked him to the head did a great service both to himself and those who would have potentially been affected by the gas leak in a bid to restore his lost sense , mr @entity7 underwent an unsuccessful operation last year which involved doctors drilling into his nose to try to improve his breathing			1
but , where skilled surgeons failed , a burly rugby player succeeded			0
mr @entity7 's latest nasal injury happened during a game involving his team , @entity81 - based @entity29 and @entity28 1st last month			0
he said : ' i 've broken my nose a number of times over the years and it gradually got worse and worse until i could n't breathe through it or smell through it			2
' i had an operation last year where they drilled into my nose to make me breathe better through it , but it did n't work			2
' so where the surgeons failed this bloke 's size 12 boot worked			0
it was at the end of the game and there was a bit of a melee on the pitch and my nose got kicked			0
' as the swelling started to go down about a week later i realised i could breathe and smell again			0
' i had sensed it was coming back , and then as i was walked up the road and i could smell gas , something i 'd never been able to detect before			1
' i called the gas board			0
what i had smelt was n't the source but gas was creeping into a chamber nearby			0
but it highlighted the area and they were able to fix it			0
' authorities moved into the street in @entity37 after mr @entity7 put his newly - restored sense to good use			1
