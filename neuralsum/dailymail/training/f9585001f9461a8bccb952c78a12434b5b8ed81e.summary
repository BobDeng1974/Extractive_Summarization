it is nothing new for @entity3 cricket captains to struggle against @entity4 when they take on one of the most demanding jobs in sport			1
more unusual is having to deal with a blackmail plot over your sex life within a month of taking charge			1
such was the alarming and , frankly , bizarre scenario facing @entity14 last week ahead of @entity3 ’s second defeat against @entity4 in a one - day triangular series also involving @entity17 here ahead of next month ’s @entity19			1
yet @entity14 who , until thursday kept his private life very much to himself , has emerged from a startling affair that could have derailed his fledgling captaincy with the coolness and calmness that marks his promising leadership style			1
@entity14 was dismissed for a golden duck in @entity3 's three wicket defeat against @entity4 @entity30 ( right ) of @entity4 celebrates removing @entity3 one - day captain @entity14 @entity14 's desire for privacy was thrown out the window this week amid a blackmail plot against him on saturday @entity39 , the woman at the centre of the unlikely scandal to hit the @entity3 team , broke her silence to publicly denounce the man who attempted to blackmail @entity14 and back the beleaguered skipper			1
her words not only appeared to exonerate @entity14 of any wrongdoing but would have been greeted with a huge sigh of relief from the @entity47 , who have spent the last year in turmoil since their ashes thrashing the last time they came here			1
‘ i ’m gutted and i ’m furious , ’ was the headline in saturday ’s @entity54 @entity53 as it carried an interview with the ‘ @entity57 mum angry at being an innocent victim of cricket ’s blackmail scandal			2
’ in it tsakirakis who described herself , colourfully , as ‘ ropeable angry ’ distanced herself from the actions of her fiancé @entity65 who demanded £ 35,000 to stop him revealing intimate details of a liaison between @entity14 and @entity68 which apparently took place in @entity54 five years ago			1
crucially for @entity14 and @entity71 cricket , she strenuously denied that she has been in contact with the @entity73 in recent times , as alleged by her now ex-fiancé , and only had a relationship with him when both were single			1
‘ i do n’t want to air mine and @entity65 ’s dirty laundry but i ’m gutted , ’ said @entity39			2
‘ i ’m ropeable angry			2
i ’m furious but i do n’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because i have to protect my children			0
they are my first priority			0
’ @entity84 , who has had a difficult past two years , has been in excellent form while in @entity4 @entity14 chats to bowler @entity84 before he begins an over against @entity17 at @entity86 on tuesday the @entity47 quickly called in @entity87 when they were contacted by @entity65 in @entity57 , scene of friday ’s international , last wednesday and by thursday he had been tracked down			1
he was apparently remorseful and regretful and was quick to apologise for his actions			0
the @entity47 decided not to press charges but details of the affair emerged on the night before the match			0
@entity39 said the messages relating to her relationship with @entity14 were so long ago that she could n’t remember them			1
she said it was just two people messaging ‘ to and fro ’			0
she believes @entity65 hacked into a deactivated @entity100 account she had at the time she met @entity14			1
‘ some of it may have been romantic or sexually explicit but it was nothing more than what any two people who are consenting adults independent of anyone else might say to each other when they fancy each other			0
‘ what upsets me the most are the reports in the media that @entity65 has said he had evidence of contact between me and @entity14 in the last 12 months			1
i have never been in contact with @entity14 while i ’ve been in a relationship with @entity65			1
well , @entity65 and i do n’t have a relationship any longer			0
‘ i feel for @entity14 and his partner because we are all innocent parties and i wish everyone well and to move on			2
i do n’t even want to be vindictive about @entity65 but i ’m not going to take responsibility for his actions			0
’ @entity14 was the victim of a blackmail plot but the @entity3 captain 's reputation has remained intact @entity3 coach @entity127 backed @entity14 for putting up with the blackmail plot over the past week @entity14 has been in a relationship for three years with @entity131 @entity130 and she is said to be fully backing him over the scandal			1
he looked a distracted figure when he took to the @entity134 on friday and was dismissed first ball but had regained his usual composure after @entity3 ’s narrow defeat			1
‘ it has n’t been distracting at all , ’ insisted @entity14			2
‘ i spoke to the @entity47 yesterday and i was very happy for them to deal with it			0
they just told me to focus on my cricket a hundred per cent and i ’ve done that			0
‘ i was very comfortable with the @entity47 dealing with it , ’ added @entity14			2
‘ i ’m happy it ’s all been cleared , everything is over and i ’ve managed to get on with my cricket as i did today			0
it was n’t easy when i came in			0
the ball was reverse swinging			0
’ and on saturday @entity14 was backed by @entity3 coach @entity127 , who feels the @entity73 has made an outstanding start to his one - day captaincy and has cleared this little unexpected hurdle in his path with ease			1
‘ he kept it out of the way of the cricket and away from the lads and moved on , ’ said @entity127 of @entity14 ’s personal problem			2
‘ that ’s what we want to do at the moment and @entity14 got on with it yesterday			2
i think @entity14 goes in with his eyes wide open with the @entity3 captaincy			1
it ’s a high profile job , it ’s a tough job , but also a very rewarding one			0
former @entity3 cricketer @entity169 ( centre ) speaks with @entity3 captain @entity14 and @entity127 ( right ) ‘ i think he ’s done really well			1
he ’s kept the captaincy simple which is important and i also think he ’s got the right level of having his own view and listening to others and being measured and making sure the players in the side have got a way of talking and shaping the way we go			0
we want the players to have a voice			0
it feels a calm dressing room and very committed as it should be			0
i think he can be well pleased			0
‘ he has an ability to handle pressure – getting a hundred in the first game at the @entity189 showed his ability to deliver when it ’s tough			0
that ’s something that will stand him in good stead going forward as a captain because over the next two months there are going to be some tough games			2
‘ i ’d say since he ’s been captain he ’s seemed more relaxed			2
it ’s early days , yes , but he seems happy around the lads and they seem very happy around him and you need that openness in the team			0
but you also need some direct leadership when a call needs to be made and he ’s prepared to make them			0
’ @entity14 has always prided himself on being a detached figure who remains something of a mystery even to @entity211 team - mates who are not even sure where he lives			1
well , the events of this week have punctured that desire for privacy and he has had a rude awakening as to what the @entity3 captaincy can entail			1
to the relief of all involved he has emerged with his reputation pretty much intact			0
it 's been a difficult and testing week for @entity14 in @entity4 but the @entity3 captain has not been derailed			1

@entity14 has been in the headlines this week after a blackmail plot
@entity3 captain @entity14 tends to try to keep his private life to himself
@entity14 faced a bizarre and *unwanted* scenario last week ahead of @entity3 's second defeat against @entity4 in one - day triangular series
