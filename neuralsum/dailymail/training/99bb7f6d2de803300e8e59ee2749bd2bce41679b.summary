a @entity1 father considered the prime suspect in the @entity4 kidnapping for six years blew open the case after coming forward to police with his child 's distinctive frilly pyjamas			1
the mystery man 's involvement was ruled out after detectives realised he was taking his own two - year - old daughter home from a crèche and had not snatched @entity15			0
he even agreed to be pictured in the clothes he wore in @entity17 , on may 3 , 2007 , to prove he was the man in the police sketch previously seen as key to cracking the case			1
his two - year - old 's pink pyjamas , which were described by one of the @entity23 's closest friends , were also brought to @entity24 to help prove his innocence			1
this is the last photo taken of the three - year - old @entity48 @entity47 , the @entity49 officer leading the investigation , described it as a ' revelation moment ' and completely changed when they thought @entity40 was kidnapped			1
the @entity49 last night confirmed it had ruled out a sighting of the man previously seen near the @entity57 ’ @entity59 apartment			0
@entity60 , a close friend of @entity61 and @entity23 , previously told officers she saw a dark - haired man carrying away a child wearing pink floral pyjamas at 9.15pm on may 3 , 2007			1
one of the so - called ‘ @entity66 ’ , miss @entity60 had been dining with the @entity57 in a nearby restaurant when their daughter went missing			1
all change : @entity60 , a close friend of @entity61 and @entity23 , described a dark - haired man carrying away a child at 9.15pm on may 3 , 2007 , but this man came forward but this has been found not to involve @entity40			1
police probe : @entity48 @entity47 last night reveals that he was ' almost certain that the man seen by @entity60 is not @entity40 's abductor ' the revelation has shifted detectives ’ focus on to a later sighting at 10pm when an @entity82 family reported seeing a man walking towards the beach carrying a blonde girl in pyjamas			1
she appeared to be in an uncomfortable position with her head slumped against him			0
@entity91 said : ' our focus in terms of understanding what happened on the night of may 3 has now given us a shift of emphasis			2
we are almost certain that the man seen by @entity60 is not @entity40 's abductor			2
' it takes us through to a position at 10pm when we see another man who is walking towards the ocean , close by to the apartment , with a young child in his arms			0
' today it was revealed the police may have made a major breakthrough in the hunt for @entity40 after more than 1,000 people came forward with fresh information and several named the same man as the prime suspect			0
the three - year - old 's disappearance was reconstructed in a dramatic @entity117 appeal last night and @entity24 has today hailed a ' truly unprecedented ' response			2
detectives believe a suspect seen carrying a child 500 yards from the @entity57 ’ holiday apartment was the kidnapper who struck just before her mother went to check on her children			0
timeline : a @entity117 special last october revealed that police believe the prime suspect was a man seen carrying a child at around 10pm on may 3 , 2007			2
the current dig is set to start on land very close to where he was seen this means @entity134 may have missed the abduction of her daughter by a matter of minutes on may 3 , 2007			0
last night several tourists who were in @entity17 that night have come forward , and crucially two have named the same person .			0

@entity141 even posed in clothes he wore that night to prove innocence
@entity91 described his *decision* to come forward as ' revelation moment '
he *'d* been seen carrying daughter by @entity60 , a friend of @entity23 and @entity61
little girl had distinctive frilly pyjamas that he also brought to @entity24
turned investigation on its head and moved kidnapping from 9.15pm to 10pm
