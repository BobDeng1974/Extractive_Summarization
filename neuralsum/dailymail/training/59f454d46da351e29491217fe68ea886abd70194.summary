i could even go blind in one eye			2
‘ it has been frightening			2
the first specialist i saw told me to stop writing			1
' but i very quickly realised that writing is my life and to stop would be ridiculous			1
' so i went and got second and third and fourth opinions , and they said actually it has nothing to do with reading and writing			2
' nothing can be done about it , though			2
' fortunately , i have two eyes			1
