by @entity0 as snowboarder @entity2 rode to @entity4 glory yesterday , she knew she was being watched by millions			1
what she did not realise was that the crowd included two very important spectators – her parents			0
the 33 - year - old , who won bronze in the slopestyle with spectacular jumps , leaps and grinds , had always banned her mother and father from coming to her competitions because it made her too nervous			1
but @entity18 and @entity19 were not going to miss the chance to see their daughter win an @entity4 medal – @entity26 ’s first ever on snow – so they flew to @entity27 to surprise her			1
' hyperactive ' : the @entity30 has apologised after hundreds of viewers complained the broadcaster had spoiled @entity2 's @entity4 bronze medal success and branded the commentators ' puerile and hyperactive ' shock : @entity2 realises her parents , who she believed were at home , were in the crowd as she competed , pictured left			1
she immediately rushed over to give them a hug , pictured right rad : @entity43 performs a stylish jump during her successful run			1
however , many viewers were less impressed with the @entity30 commentary error : during the commentary , the presenters incorrectly told the nation @entity51 had won gold and un-sportingly whooped with delight when a competitor fell over the @entity56 medalist celebrates during the flower ceremony for the women 's snowboard @entity58 ( left to right ) silver medalist @entity61 of @entity62 , gold medalist @entity59 of the @entity60 and bronze medalist @entity2 pose on the podium miss @entity2 burst into tears when she saw them at the finish point moments after realising she had taken bronze			1

’ mr @entity43 added : ‘ i need a whisky – i think we both need a drink and a long sleep			1
it ’s been great coming out here			0
’ as well as her parents ’ support , @entity43 had the help of an unusual lucky charm – a tea bag tucked into her bra			1
the snowboarder , who was the oldest competitor by more than six years , said she felt ‘ absolutely ecstatic ’			2
‘ a few said , “ is she past it ? ” but … i did the best run i could have done … you sense the world is watching and you had to control that part of things and not let it get to you too much			2
apres - ski ? @entity97 snowboarder @entity2 tweeted this , suggesting she might have gone out celebrating after her win			1
viewers were repeatedly told viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were that 's the one : @entity2 celebrates after her second run in the women 's slopestyle in @entity107 just beginning : @entity2 pictured aged 18 when the sportswoman had just started her first full season the sportswoman pictured with a black eye ( left ) and cuts to her face ( right ) sustained through her sport star in the making : @entity43 in 2002 , a few years after winning her first of five @entity117 ‘ i feel very proud to have won a bronze medal for my country			1
i ca n’t believe it ’s our first on snow			0
’ she added : ‘ it is still sinking in , the history part … i absolutely had no idea of this when i was a chalet maid cooking breakfast and cleaning toilets … it was just about snowboarding			2
’ it was while working on the ski slopes that @entity43 developed her superstition			1
missing @entity97 home comforts , she noticing some tea bags as she was cleaning a room			0
‘ i put one inside my bra so i could have a drink later , ’ she revealed in an interview in 2012			0
‘ i forgot all about it and went out snowboarding and completed my first ever backflip			2
it was only later that i remembered the tea bag but it had crumbled into a load of loose leaves			0
i could n’t use them to make a cuppa so i gathered them up and kept them for a couple of years until they crumbled into nothing but they brought me more good luck			2
’ she has continued the ritual for competitions ever since			0
at one stage yesterday the snowboarder held the lead after scoring 87.25 points in her second run and had an agonising wait while ten athletes tried to better her mark			1

miss @entity2 said : ‘ it was so difficult waiting			1
i thought i did my best run and landed it as best as i could , thankfully it was enough			2
