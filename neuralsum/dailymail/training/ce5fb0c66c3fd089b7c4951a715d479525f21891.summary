the trampoline measure an impressive 170ft long - the same length as 13 double decker buses			1
the space of the festival , as a creative laboratory , builds a territory of experiments in different spheres of art , but foremost in architecture			0
@entity44 provides a rare opportunity for @entity10 and foreign architects to act like artists by allowing them to create on the ' @entity21 ' ground			1

' on the territory of ' @entity21 ' there remain objects in accordance to the spatial idea of the @entity95			2
' of course , art has no practical value but the task that we are working on is to extend the chain where the peace of art becomes irreplaceable , connected with the processes which take place on the area			0

the ' road ' has been a hit with visitors since it opened at the @entity21 festival
