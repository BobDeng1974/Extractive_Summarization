by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 26 july 2013 cancer sufferer @entity1 , 65 , had to cancel a trip to the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , because she was dying , but the hotel sent her daughter a bill for the full stay a hotel sent its lawyers after a grieving daughter to recover £ 1,200 after she had to cancel a family holiday - because her mother was dying			1
@entity1 , 65 , was diagnosed with cancer in january and booked five nights at the four star @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , in june for a final holiday with her relatives			1
but the retired florist soon became too ill to travel and her daughter @entity21 , 42 , phoned the hotel six weeks before their trip to cancel the booking			1
her mother died three weeks later on may 31 , and mrs @entity21 expected the £ 150 deposit to be returned in full			2
but the hotel demanded £ 1,266.67 for the full stay because the cancellation was ' short notice '			1
mrs @entity21 , from @entity28 , said : ' when you are going through cancer you need something to look forward to			0
' my mother did n’t know she was going to die this early			0
' she is now asking for a formal apology and compensation from the hotel , which told her it would refund the deposit and cancel the fees if she withdrew her complaint on review site @entity44			2
' they are obviously embarrassed and ashamed about their business practices and they do n’t want it communicated any further , ' mrs @entity21 said			0
' in the memory of my mother i will continue to fight them until i get an apology because this is unacceptable			0
' weeks after mrs @entity1 's death , her daughter received a solicitor 's letter threatening possible ' recovery action ' if ' full cancellation fees ' were not paid within 14 days			1
the letter said that customers were advised to take out travel insurance and that the hotel had not been able to fill the room			1
mrs @entity21 is now asking for compensation for having to take time off work to deal with the hotel			2
she said : ' out of everything - arranging the funeral , telling family - this is the most upsetting and constant piece of administration i have had to go through			2
' i do n’t understand how in this modern customer service times they can be this rigid and unappreciative			0
' word of mouth is meant to be their bread and butter - this approach is really bad for the @entity82 hospitality industry			2
' the @entity4 said mrs @entity21 was refusing to accept a refund for her £ 150 deposit and was instead demanding £ 1,500 compensation			1
the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , has offered to cancel the fees if mrs @entity21 withdraws her complaint from sites such as @entity44 a spokesman said : ' at the time of the booking they made no mention to the hotel of any health issues			1
' as with every customer they were strongly advised at the time of booking to take out insurance in respect of any potential cancellation and declined to do so			0
' the booking was cancelled at short notice and the hotel was unable to reallocate the accommodation			1
' it is the hotel ’s standard practice in those circumstances , as it is across the industry , to invoice and recover cancellation charges			0
' a polite and sympathetic request was sent to mrs @entity21 by the hotel and subsequently by the hotel ’s solicitors without success			1
' following communications from mrs @entity21 the hotel promptly offered to forego the said cancellation charges and indeed to refund any deposit paid			0
' the @entity117 said it would always advise customers to read cancellation procedures at the time of booking and take out appropriate insurance			0
a spokesman said : ' likewise accommodation providers need to have a clear and simple cancellation policy that they tell customers about at the time of booking			0

@entity1 , 65 , booked a final holiday at the @entity4 in @entity5
but she became too ill and her daughter cancelled the five - night stay
the hotel 's solicitors sent a letter demanding the full fee for ' short notice '
