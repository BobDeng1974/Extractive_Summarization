@entity0 was given a new platinum implant facial palsy , or weakness of the facial muscles , can stop the patient 's eyelids closing properly			1
@entity0 , 54 , a housewife from @entity7 , @entity8 , was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again , as she tells @entity11			1
the patient a few years ago i started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my gp referred me for scans which showed i had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear			1
surgery was the only option			1
thankfully the operation , in july 2012 , was a success			1
but my facial nerve , which was wrapped around the tumour , was damaged			1
i 'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side - effect , but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy			1
apparently , it 's the same thing that can happen after a stroke			2
i felt very self - conscious , but the problems were n't just aesthetic			2
i 'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste , and my mouth became dry			1
eating and speaking were difficult - and , worst of all , my left eye was permanently open and i could n't even blink with it			1
to close it , i had to push the upper lid down with my hand			2
the eye itself was dry and painful			0
to sleep , i had to seal it closed with tape			0
i 'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve , so i was hopeful			0
i tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone , including facial massages , taught by a physiotherapist			1
i also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life			0
it was very stressful - i stopped socialising as much , in case people stared			0
after a year , it was clear the nerve would never work again so i was referred to @entity65 , a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the @entity67			1
he explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - i 'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this was n't affected			1
apparently , surgeons used to use gold , but platinum is better because it does n't irritate the eye 's inside lining			1
it is also more dense than gold , so you need only a thin chain , which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid			1
i had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in february last year			0
surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it my eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye , then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place			1
it was strange watching it all but did n't hurt			0
i went home that day , and the difference was immediately obvious			0
the eye gently shut , and stayed shut , of its own accord			0
i could go to sleep without needing tape			0
i ca n't feel the implant , no one can see it , and i can blink normally			1
the procedure has made me look more normal - people do n't stare as much			1
it 's really boosted my confidence			0
the surgeon @entity65 is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at @entity67 in @entity122			0
around 100,000 people in @entity124 have facial palsy			1
it can be caused by a stroke , if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve			1
it can also be a result of traumatic injury , damage after surgery , or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in @entity141 's palsy , which affects more than 28,000 people a year			1
facial palsy affects not just appearance , but lots of functions , too			1
the facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides , then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue 's taste buds , for instance , and the salivary glands , so patients may suffer from dry mouth			1
most also have difficulty blinking , because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut			1
however , it does not control the levator muscle , which holds it open			0
while many patients will recover , with symptoms easing within eight weeks , @entity0 's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function			1
when she first saw me , her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways			2
this can cause all sorts of problems , from dryness to injury			0
five years ago , i would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid			2
the extra weight makes the eyelid heavier , so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes			0
this procedure is used widely across the @entity186			0
but i now believe platinum is much better			2
it 's 10 per cent more dense than gold , so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight			2
@entity193 is also inert - gold will cause reactions , such as irritation and inflammation , in about 5 per cent of people			0
the left side of her face was droopy - until now i helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight			1
for @entity0 , i used three links weighing 0.4g each			1
this is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light			0
this way , we can easily add or remove a link			0
in 2013 , we carried out a study at @entity67 , using platinum chain implants on 18 patients			2
only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant , compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant ( the study will be published in the @entity227 )			2
first , we anaesthetised the skin around @entity0 's eye			1
then , on a workbench , i linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight i required ( i 'd previously done a trial run , sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight )			2
i made an incision across the outside of her eyelid , where it makes a natural crease , making sure not to cut through to the eyeball			2
i placed the links inside this incision , above the eyeball , stitching the chain in place from the outside in , before closing the incision			0
these nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body			0
by then , the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue			0
when the chain was in place , and the eye was open , it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye			0
even when the eye is shut , the implant does n't touch the cornea			2
when @entity0 wanted to blink , her brain switched off the levator muscle , which keeps the eyelid wide open			1
the corresponding muscle , the orbicularis occuli muscle , which should pull the eyelid down , does not work in @entity0 's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve			1
the percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness however , the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall , thanks to gravity			2
although it was n't a perfect solution - at first , @entity0 's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again			1
over time , the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves			0
risks include infection and bleeding , but these are rare			0
i hope the implant will last @entity0 a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice			1
@entity299 ? ' gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy , ' says @entity302 , a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at @entity304			2
' @entity193 is more expensive , but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions			0
and as the implants are less bulky , it 's also superior cosmetically			0
' this chain segment innovation seems to work well			0
any procedure can result in post-operative problems , but these appear to be rare			0
' longer - term follow - up is needed before we can conclude that chain - link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights , such as bars			2
but they are promising so far			0
' the operation costs around Â£ 3,000 privately			0
the @entity186 does not automatically fund it			0

@entity0 had surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear
while the op was a success , it damaged a facial nerve
the left side of her face consequently appeared droopy
but a new platinum implant has ' made her look more normal '
