new commander : marine general @entity0 took over sunday as the new and probably last commander of all @entity3 and international forces in @entity4 transition of power : @entity0 took over leadership of the @entity15 , and a smaller but separate detachment of @entity3 troops , from @entity19 general @entity18 , who had led them for the past 19 months ‘ today is not about change , it 's about continuity , ’ @entity0 told a gathering of coalition military leaders and @entity4 officials			1
‘ what 's not changed is the growing capability of our @entity4 partners , the @entity4 national security forces			1
what 's not changed is our commitment , more importantly , what 's not changed is the inevitability of our success			0
’ he takes charge at a critical time for president @entity44 and the military			0
@entity8 decided at its 2010 summit in @entity47 to withdraw major combat units , but to continue training and funding @entity4 troops and leave a residual force to hunt down @entity52 and other terrorist groups			2
general @entity54 , chairman of the @entity55 , said ‘ much work lies ahead ’ for @entity57 as he tries to meet those objectives while at the same time withdrawing about 100,000 foreign troops , including 66,000 from the @entity3			1
@entity0 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , will face serious challenges as he tries to accommodate an accelerated timetable for handing over the lead for security responsibility to @entity4 forces this spring - instead of late summer as originally planned			1
no easy task : general @entity54 , chairman of the @entity55 , pictured , said ' much work lies ahead ' for @entity57 ‘ i told him our victory here will never be marked by a parade or a point in time on a calendar when victory is declared			0
this insurgency will be defeated over time by the legitimate and well - trained @entity4 forces that are emerging today and who are taking the field in full force this spring , ’ @entity18 said			1
he added that success would be described as an ‘ @entity4 force defending @entity4 people , and enabling an @entity4 government to serve its citizens			2
this is victory ; this is what winning looks like			0
’ although the @entity4 security forces are almost at their full strength of 352,000 , it is unclear if they are yet ready to take on the fight by themselves			1
before departing , @entity18 admitted that the @entity4 still need much work to become an effective and self - sufficient fighting machine , but he said a vast improvement in their abilities was behind a decision to accelerate the timetable for putting them in the lead nationwide this spring when the traditional fighting season begins			0
@entity44 said last month that the @entity4 would take over this spring instead of late summer - a decision that could allow the speedier withdrawal of foreign forces from @entity4			2
it is also unclear when the remaining 66,000 @entity3 troops would return home , or how many @entity3 soldiers will remain after the end of 2014			0
wrapping up : the @entity3 - led @entity8 coalition is entering the final stretch of its participation in a war that will have lasted more than 13 years when most foreign combat troops pull out at the end of 2014 @entity44 may use his @entity117 on tuesday to announce the next steps for concluding the war and a timetable for withdrawal along with plans for a residual force post- 2014			0
much of that depends on the @entity3 negotiating a bilateral security agreement with the government that includes the contentious issue of immunity from @entity4 prosecution for any @entity3 forces that would remain here after 2014			1
president @entity132 has said he will put any such decision in the hands of a council of @entity4 elders , known as a @entity137			0
although @entity54 said earlier in the week that the @entity3 had plans to leave a residual force , a failure to strike a deal on immunity would torpedo any security agreement and lead to a complete pullout of @entity3 forces after 2014 - as it did in post-war @entity145			2
it is widely believed that no @entity8 - member nation would allow its troops to remain after 2014 to train , or engage in counterterrorism activities , without a similar deal			0
the head of @entity8 joint command in @entity154 , @entity155 gen. @entity152 , said the alliance was already making plans for a post- 2014 presence , plans he said that were ‘ all well advanced			0
’ @entity18 , 59 , of @entity160 , @entity161 , was the longest serving @entity15 commander so far			0
nearly two dozen generals have commanded troops from the @entity3 and @entity15 since the @entity3 invasion in late 2001 - with six @entity3 generals including @entity0 running both commands in the past five years alone			1
also attending the ceremony were @entity19 general @entity168 , commander , @entity170 , and general @entity171 , head of the @entity19			0
hands off : @entity4 president @entity132 said he will put negotiations for a bilateral security agreement between the @entity3 and @entity4 in the hands of a council of @entity4 elders , known as a @entity137			1

marine general @entity0 took over sunday as the new commander of all @entity3 and international forces in @entity4
