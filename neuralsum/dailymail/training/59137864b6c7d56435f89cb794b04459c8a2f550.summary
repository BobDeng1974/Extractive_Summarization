@entity1 inspectors who grilled pupils on ' @entity4 values ' have been accused of asking a young girl at a @entity7 school whether she was a virgin			1
the pupil , aged around 12 , was allegedly asked the invasive question when inspectors visited @entity11			1
the extraordinary claim emerged as mps questioned chief @entity1 sir @entity15 , who flatly denied the allegation			1
he told the education select committee he had conducted a ' thorough ' investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false			1
chief inspector sir @entity15 defended the way inspections are carried out to check that schools are teaching ' @entity4 values ' @entity27 , 10 , says she came home in tears after being questioned by @entity1 inspectors about lesbians			1
her mother @entity32 said the questioning was ' completely inappropriate ' but last night the chairman of @entity11 's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously , saying : ' there is something in it			1
' @entity41 added that it was ' clearly the case that inspectors are asking questions that most people would think of as inappropriate for the age '			1
and he accused sir @entity15 of making himself ' a hostage to fortune ' by denying there was a problem			1
parents branded the chief inspector ' condescending ' and complained he had not spoken to them or taken their concerns seriously			2
@entity11 is set to close after inspectors branded children ' intolerant ' in a disastrous @entity1 report which also pointed out failures in teaching and attainment			1
parents say their children , aged 11 to 13 , were asked ' inappropriate ' questions about gay people , @entity65 and sex			1
some pupils were allegedly asked whether there were any gay children in their class			2
it is one of a number of schools who say they are falling victim to the government 's new @entity4 values drive , which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles			2
@entity83 in @entity84 has been put in special measures after children were branded intolerant			2
@entity88 mp @entity87 warned that some of the parents claim that @entity1 has ' got it in for christian schools ' yesterday , @entity87 , @entity88 mp for @entity94 , said he had been ' inundated ' with emails and letters from parents at @entity11			1
he suggested families felt there was a political agenda and that ' @entity1 had got it in for @entity7 schools '			1
' some parents claim that there were some inappropriate approaches to the inspection , ' he said			2
' a member of parliament said to me last night that one parent had claimed that a girl was even asked if she was a virgin			2
is that something you would investigate ? ' sir @entity15 replied : ' we have investigated those allegations and those allegations are false			1
we 've spent a long time looking at this			0
' but he did admit that inspectors may ask children whether they call each other ' gay ' or ' lesbo '			1
sir @entity15 replied : ' i ca n't imagine an inspector asking those sorts of questions			1
if any inspector behaved inappropriately they would be dealt with very severely by @entity1			2
' the chairman of @entity11 's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously , saying : ' there is something in it ' education secretary @entity137 has insisted students should be taught about values such as tolerance , respect , democracy and the rule of law regardless of faith or cultural alignment yesterday , parents at both schools denied there was homophobic bullying and called for sir @entity15 to investigate their complaints properly			1
dr @entity151 , 36 , who has four children at @entity153 , said : ' we feel that @entity1 's response to our concerns is patronising			2
' @entity15 is adamant he has made a full investigation , but how can this be when he has not spoken to any of the staff or parents involved and addressed our concerns ? ' @entity160 of the @entity161 said : ' parents are disappointed @entity1 has not taken their allegations seriously			1
' last summer , the government announced all schools will be required to teach @entity4 values following the @entity168 controversy over @entity170 attempts to infiltrate schools			0
the drive has been backed by education secretary @entity137 , dubbed ms u-turn			0
by @entity174 , political editor for @entity175 dozens of primary school pupils a year are suspended for being drunk or high on drugs , figures reveal			0
every week in term time at least one exclusion order is imposed on an under - 11 for offences including alcohol abuse or drug dealing			0
at secondary school the situation is worse still , with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012 - 13 , sparking warnings that teachers are losing the battle against substance abuse			0
figures released in @entity192 this week show that in 2012 - 13 , 40 children at primary schools in @entity195 were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs			0
the @entity199 said this included alcohol abuse , drug dealing , inappropriate use of prescribed drugs , possession of illegal drugs , smoking and substance abuse			0
there are 39 weeks in the average term , meaning one pupil aged five - 11 is suspended every week			0
@entity211 mp @entity210 , who obtained the figures , told @entity175 : ' the striking thing is that 40 primary school children have been excluded because they turned up drunk or high			0
' it is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence			0
' we do have to ask what is happening to the parents of these children and are they being prosecuted			0
clearly they are getting the drugs and alcohol from somewhere			0
' the figures show that there were 6,590 drink and drug related fixed period suspensions in secondary schools in 2012 - 13 , the latest year for which figures are available			0
another 360 exclusions were imposed , where students were removed from the school permanently , accounting for one in ten of all expulsions			0
a @entity199 spokesman said : ' prohibited items including alcohol and drugs have no place whatsoever in the classroom			0
' we have introduced a range of powers for teachers to ensure discipline , behaviour and safety are maintained			0
' our guidance on behaviour clarifies what head teachers can do to properly discipline disruptive pupils and frees up teachers ' time and energy			0

sir @entity15 insists claims of inappropriate questions are untrue
@entity11 , which girl attended , is taking allegation seriously
it is set to close after inspectors described its students as ' intolerant '
inquiries into bullying would ask if pupils called each other ' gay or lesbo '
@entity88 mp warns parents think @entity1 has ' got it in for christian schools '
