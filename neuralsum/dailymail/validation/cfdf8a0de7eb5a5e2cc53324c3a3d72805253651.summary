ants may be the perfect workers - they share chores , solve complex problems and work to the death without complaint			1
and now the behaviour and appearance of nature ’s most diligent insect has been emulated in plastic and metal , with the creation of @entity13			0
@entity15 engineers have crafted machines that mimic the cooperative behaviour of a colony , because the robots can make individual decisions as well as work as a team			1
and they are capable of manoeuvring objects , hinting that such robots could one day replace humans as factory workers			1
the firm said : ‘ for the first time , the cooperative behaviour of the creatures has also been transferred to the world of technology using complex control algorithms			1
’ the machines work together to complete difficult tasks , such as manipulating a large object , as real ants do in nature			1
they do this by using a stereo camera fitted in each robot ’s head which helps an individual ant locate and identify target objects			1
an ant can then pick it up using serrated grippers below its head			1
sensors enable an ant to be aware of its surroundings and the robotic insects communicate over a wireless network to coordinate their actions			1
the robots have plastic , @entity69 printed bodies with electric circuits printed on top , ( pictured ) while their legs and grippers are ceramic actuators which can bend precisely and easily using little energy ‘ like their natural role models , the @entity81 work together under clear rules , ’ said dr @entity78 , head of future concepts at the firm			1
‘ they communicate with each other and coordinate both their actions and movements			0
‘ each ant makes its decisions autonomously , but in doing so is always subordinate to the common objective and thereby plays its part towards solving the task at hand			2
’ @entity94 has launched a competition encouraging engineers to create its next generation of shelf - picking robots			0
bots will battle it out at the @entity102 conference in @entity103 in may			0
' the challenge combines object recognition , pose recognition , grasp planning , compliant manipulation , motion planning , task planning , task execution , and error detection and recovery , ' @entity94 said			0
participating robots will earn points by locating products on shelves , retrieving them and putting them into cardboard boxes ready to be sent to customers			0
points will be deducted for dropped or damaged good and the team that creates the winning robot will win $ 26,000 ( £ 17,463 )			2
@entity94 currently uses robots by @entity124 to fetch items so its human workforces does n’t have to walk as far in its vast warehouses			0
but its machines ca n't pick and pack products yet			2
the robots have plastic , 3d printed bodies with electric circuits printed on top , @entity134 reported , while their legs and grippers are ceramic actuators which can bend precisely and easily using little energy			2
the aim of the project is to create intelligent bots that could work in factories , taking over production jobs from humans			1
this is not as far - fetched as it may seem			0
@entity94 already uses an army of 15,000 robots in its huge warehouses to pick up items ordered by customers			0
‘ each ant makes its decisions autonomously , but in doing so is always subordinate to the common objective and thereby plays its part towards solving the task at hand ( pictured ) ’ the company said the @entity13 will go on show at @entity160 - the world ’s largest industrial technology fair - in april , along with other creations such as the firm ’s robotic butterflies ( pictured ) @entity32 's bionic butterflies are incredibly light and are able to fly as a collective			1
ten cameras installed in the room record the butterflies using infrared markers			2
they transmit this position data to a computer , which coordinates the artificial insects ' flight			2
the intelligent networking system creates a guidance and monitoring system to stop the butterflies colliding , which could be used for drones working in future factories			2
while they are not as cute as the ants and work alongside humans , they are able to deliver heavy stacks of toys , books and other products to employees to pack			1
the @entity13 will go on show at @entity160 - the world ’s largest industrial technology fair - in april , along with other creations such as the firm ’s robotic butterflies			2
like the ants , the @entity199 are designed to work together and can fly autonomously without bumping into each other by using lightweight cameras and an intelligent guiding and monitoring system			1
‘ the communication and sensor technology used , which constitutes an indoor gps system , enables the butterflies to exhibit collective behaviour without danger of collision , ’ the company said			0

the colourful lizard is able to put its tongue over prey and securely enclose it - a process that the robot mimics			0
it uses the principle to grip a wide selection of objects in a form - fitting manner using an elastic silicone cap and can even pick up several objects , such as ball bearings , at once			0
the machine does n't physically resemble a chameleon and could be used on a production line			0
' the chameleon is able to catch a variety of different insects by putting its tongue over the respective prey and securely enclosing it , ' the firm says			1
' the @entity244 uses this principle to grip the widest range of objects in a form - fitting manner			0
the robot uses the same technique to grip a wide selection of objects in a form - fitting manner using an elastic silicone cap and can even pick up several objects , such as ball bearings , at once ( pictured )			0

@entity15 engineering firm @entity32 created the @entity279 insects to *improve* factory robotics
machines have cameras and sensors as well as ' grippers ' to move objects
they can make independent decisions and work together as a team
*researchers* say bionic insects could one day be used in place of humans in factories
