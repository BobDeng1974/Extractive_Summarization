this year marks the 30th anniversary of the charity i set up with my husband @entity3 and eldest son @entity4 , after we appeared in the moving and highly successful film @entity7			1
the true tale of @entity9 the lion cub and the game wardens , @entity12 and @entity13 , who raised her and then released her back into the wild has inspired and delighted generations			1
over the years we have had the backing of @entity18 and its readers			2
to have that kind of support to make people think and care about animals is invaluable			1
it was an elephant which led us to establish the charity that became the @entity26			1
one of them was an elephant called slowly , about @entity42 , a little female elephant who had been captured by the then @entity45 government when she was only two and given as a gift to @entity47			2
her sad story is told below and it prompted us to set up @entity26 , which later became @entity7			1
we have spent three decades exposing the suffering of captive animals and , sadly , it is work that is as necessary today as it was all those years ago			1
we are desperate to improve the plight of more than 40 solitary elephants held in zoos and circuses in @entity59			1
we also work with @entity60 , the charity founded by the @entity62 ’s late brother , @entity61 , to save the endangered @entity64 elephant			1
i continue to visit zoos around the world to monitor the animals kept there			1
where possible we try to have them removed if they are in poor condition – or at least to improve those conditions			1
when @entity3 and i set up @entity26 , it was dismissed as a nine - day wonder			1
but today @entity7 is an internationally renowned organisation with more than 100,000 supporters and a host of celebrity supporters , including @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
@entity3 died 20 years ago and our son @entity4 is now president of @entity7			1
and both of us feel as strongly about the cause as we did at the start			2
@entity3 and @entity29 visiting @entity42 the @entity41 - the animal was snatched from her wild family and given as a gift from the then @entity45 government to @entity47 in the early days , i was nervous about putting forward my views because we were not scientists , and many people probably thought we did n’t know what we were talking about			1
but now , because i ’m old , and i know i have n’t that much time , everything is more urgent			2
i ’ve got to speak out			0
i want to be judged for what i believe in			0
i still have plenty of fire and fight			0
this month i am publishing my first book of poetry , and i am taking a group of people to @entity45 on safari			1
we will visit @entity9 ’s grave , of course , which will bring back many memories			0
i hope her descendants still roam the @entity113			0
but there remains a lot of unending work to do to ensure lions still live there in the future			0
my dream is to create a sanctuary for elephants in solitary captivity in @entity59 , perhaps in @entity124 or the @entity125			2
the cramped cage that @entity32 and @entity127 lived in ( left ) and @entity128 the leopard relaxing yesterday the @entity26 lent its support to the @entity131 for @entity41 and @entity132			1
our patrons , actress @entity135 , broadcaster @entity136 and racing driver @entity137 joined hundreds of members of the public to draw attention to the 50,000 elephants killed every year for their ivory			2
shockingly , an elephant is massacred every 15 minutes for its ivory , and a rhino is killed every nine hours for its horn			0
often these magnificent beasts are still alive when their tusks and horns are hacked from their faces			0
here are just a few of the @entity26 ’s success stories , many made possible by you			1
but we must do more			0
wo n’t you join us ? join @entity7 today for the original 1980s price of £ 12 to mark the 30th anniversary			1

@entity128 , a sweet - natured leopard , was discovered in 1994 locked inside a 6ft x 6ft cage on top of a disco building in @entity35 , along with lions @entity127 and @entity32			0
during his years of captivity , @entity128 had suffered extreme distress caused by the barren conditions and lack of exercise			2
he was also suffering from poor nutrition			0
@entity128 had been born in a travelling circus on the island before the restaurateur took him			0
mail on sunday readers raised thousands to free him and the campaign was joined by @entity181 , mother of @entity182 , the 28 - year - old photographer murdered in a @entity45 game reserve in 1988			0
for five years @entity128 lived in a wildlife sanctuary in @entity186 , run by the @entity26 , before finally , in 1999 , he was released into a sanctuary near @entity188 in @entity189 this pair of lions were bought as cubs by a @entity35 restaurant owner as an attraction for his business			1
he also kept @entity196 the leopard captive as a customer attraction ( see his story below )			0
for five years , @entity127 and @entity32 were incarcerated in the tiny , rusting cage perched on a sun - baked roof			0
some reports at the time claimed they had been fed live dogs within sight of a luxurious hotel			0
malnourished and frustrated , the thin and filthy lions spent their days pacing back and forth			0
@entity32 and @entity127 pictured being released from captivity in the the @entity210 reserve in @entity189 the foundation launched a campaign to free them and , with the support of @entity18 , managed to rescue them in 1995			0
a special hotline was set up for the animals , and horrified readers of this newspaper contributed a total of nearly £ 60,000			1
the lions spent two years in a @entity223 big cat sanctuary before being shipped to the @entity210 reserve where they were released and eventually reunited with @entity128 , who had already been saved			0
@entity42 was only two when she was snatched from her wild family and was given as a gift from the then @entity45 government to @entity47			0
@entity3 and @entity230 did everything they could to stop the move but the baby elephant ’s fate was sealed			1
in 1982 the couple went to see @entity42 in @entity237 and were dismayed by her miserable existence			0
with no companions of her own and prematurely aged by captivity , she had become difficult to manage			0
the death of @entity42 the elephant inspired @entity29 's @entity26 , which evolved into the @entity26 clearly frustrated , she paced her barren enclosure			1
but when they called her name she stopped , turned and came to them , straining with her trunk to reach their hands			0
‘ it was a heartbreaking and life - changing moment , ’ recalls @entity230			0
the @entity254 renewed their campaign to give @entity42 a better life , but in 1983 when she was just 16 ( elephants can live to over 60 ) she died			2
determined her death would not be in vain , in 1984 the @entity260 launched @entity26 , which evolved into the @entity26			1
call of the wild : @entity263 the leopard is freed at last for ten years , their home was a 20ft cage set into the cliffs of @entity268			2
but after a five - year campaign by @entity18 and the @entity26 , leopards @entity270 and @entity263 were set free in 2008			1
the animals were part of the @entity274 , started in the 1950s by @entity275			2
the decision to release them was taken by his son and successor @entity278			0
they were taken to the @entity210 reserve in @entity189 , where @entity263 , aged 14 , set off with a roar from her cage			2
@entity270 , 13 , had to be coaxed out			0
the campaign had begun with a @entity18 on sunday report that led to thousands of protest letters , which @entity230 and a group of children delivered to @entity292 ’s consulate in @entity237			2
today he is the star of a much viewed @entity295 clip			2
but in 1969 , @entity297 the lion was bought as a cub from the then @entity300 pet section by two young @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 , for 250 @entity304 naming him @entity297 , they raised him in their flat on the @entity308 , and he became a star of swinging @entity237			1
he exercised in a nearby churchyard , and the friends wrote a book about him , @entity310 called @entity297			0
but he grew from a 35 lb cub to a rather more imposing 185 lb adult a year later			1
his future was secured when he was spotted by @entity230 and , with the help of @entity12 and @entity13 , was taken to @entity189			0
a year later , @entity303 and @entity302 went to see him			0
although warned they should n't approach @entity297 as he was now wild , the lion clearly remembered his human chums , and his exuberant delight at their reunion has become a @entity295 phenomenon			2
cool cat : @entity297 the lion in @entity237 with @entity302 , right , and @entity303 - the pair bought the cub in @entity300 before raising him and releasing him into the wild			1
