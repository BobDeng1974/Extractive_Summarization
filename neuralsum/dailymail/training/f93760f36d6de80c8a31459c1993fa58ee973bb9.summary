by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 07:45 est , 2 april 2013 motorists were seeing double yesterday after road chiefs put up a sign on a busy commuter road - identical to one just 20 feet away			2
drivers were left scratching their heads when they saw the two signs showing exactly the same information as each other despite being just metres apart			2
but despite the identical notices on the @entity12 route on the outskirts of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , who manage and maintain the road , insisted they had not made a mistake			1
@entity14 : drivers were scratching their heads when they saw the two signs with the same information just in case you missed it : the company say the existing sign will be moved in the next fortnight a spokeswoman said : ' a new sign has been put up to accommodate new signage for a u-turn ban and junction warning signs			1
' the existing sign that was there originally will be moved in the next fortnight			0
' the second banner details how far away @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are from the @entity14			1
and when asked why the company could not just move the original sign @entity42 said that would deprive drivers of the necessary information while it was being moved			0
she added : ' the whole idea is to have two signs so that no information is lost for the motorists while the the move takes place			0
two for one : some drivers questioned their eyesight when they drove past the two identical signs ' it is normal to put the new sign up before the old one is taken down			1
' one motorist said : ' i was just coming around the roundabout when i first saw the sign			0
' i thought there was something wrong with my eyesight because just half a second later i saw exactly the same thing again			0

the signs were put up on the @entity12 on the outskirts of @entity14 , @entity15
