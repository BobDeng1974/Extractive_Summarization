@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 would love to follow in @entity3 's footsteps by making an impact against @entity5 - but remarkably admits to not having seen his penalty save from the 1988 fa cup final			1
monday will be a special occasion for everybody associated with the @entity10 , who are in the @entity7 third round for the first time since their rebirth in 2002			1
player trials on @entity18 and @entity19 football seems an awful long time ago now , though , with the club chasing promotion from @entity22 and readying themselves for a mouth - watering clash with @entity5			1
@entity1 keeper @entity0 is hoping to emulate @entity3 's performance against @entity5 @entity1 goalkeeper @entity3 dives to save @entity27 's penalty in the 1988 fa cup final at @entity28 the @entity30 encounter brings with it memories of the most famous day in @entity1 's history , when the @entity33 shocked the @entity35 behemoths to win the @entity7			1
@entity36 scored the decisive goal at @entity28 that day , although captain @entity3 's save from a @entity27 penalty remains the iconic image - one current @entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 admits he has yet to see			1
' i have n't seen the save but i 've heard it is unbelievable , ' he said			2
' i remember ( former @entity1 manager ) @entity45 telling me about it when i was about to join			2
' he talked me through the whole history of the club and everything , but i have n't had the chance to see it yet			0
' i 've been meaning to see the @entity33 documentary as well , but i do n't have @entity52			0
my old man has recorded it for me so i 've got to go around his and watch it			0
@entity56 ( left ) holds off @entity58 's @entity57 during @entity1 's @entity7 first round win former @entity1 player @entity60 will lead @entity1 out against @entity5 in the @entity7 third round ' i 've seen ( other ) videos , i 've seen the goal and inside the stadium there are pictures everywhere			1
' it was a great day for them			0
they were n't expected to win and hopefully we can replicate what they done			0
' @entity3 will be amongst the 4,800 crammed into @entity30 on monday and , given his own career started with non-league @entity75 , he will appreciate @entity0 's journey to @entity1			1
the 23 - year - old came through the ranks at @entity79 , where , alongside the likes of @entity81 , he won the 2009 @entity82 against @entity5			1
@entity0 progressed to the first - team and was on the bench for five @entity85 matches during the 2012 - 13 season - what proved to be his last campaign with the @entity88			2
the @entity90 - born goalkeeper was released and dropped into non-league with @entity92 , leading him to seriously consider a future out of the game			2
( @entity96 ) @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity98 train ahead of their @entity7 third round clash @entity0 began his career at @entity79 and was an unused substitute in five @entity85 matches he said : ' it was getting to that point when i had to think " what am i going to do with myself ? " ' i did n't know			1
i was n't too sure			0
all i ever wanted to do was play football and to go into non-league it was a shock			0
' thankfully for @entity0 it all worked out and the goalkeeper calls his time with @entity111 the ' best thing ' he has ever done			2
the goalkeeper remains thankful to the club and @entity45 for helping him get the move back to league football with @entity1 , for whom he will be the last line of defence against @entity5 , ' it 's going to be a very hard game - not just for me , but the whole team , ' @entity0 said			1
' it is a great game to be a part of			0
we are in a no - lose situation , really			0
we 're not expected to win , apart from the pressure we put on ourselves			0
hopefully we can put on a show on monday			0
