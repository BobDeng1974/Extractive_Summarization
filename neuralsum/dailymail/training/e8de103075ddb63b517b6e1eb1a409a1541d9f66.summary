@entity0 became the latest footballer to commemorate his @entity3 moment by nabbing one of the pitchside photographer 's cameras to capture the special occasion			1
in the aftermath of @entity10 's dramatic 3 - 2 victory against @entity11 at @entity12 , the @entity14 playmaker - who scored a stunning free - kick to spark the @entity17 ' comeback - sneakily borrowed @entity20 's @entity19 ' lens to snap a few shots of the celebrations			1
the 29 - year - old , wearing an @entity10 scarf wrapped around his head , ignored the temptation for yet another footballer selfie , to take a picture of match winner @entity30 striking a victory pose with @entity33			2
through the looking glass : @entity35 borrows @entity38 photographer 's camera at @entity12 smile ! the @entity14 playmaker marked the occasion of @entity10 's win by snapping the celebrations @entity44 shot : @entity0 captured goal hero @entity30 ( @entity45 ) and @entity33 after the @entity17 ' 3 - 2 comeback win @entity19 was unaware that @entity0 had used his camera until afterwards			1
he said : ' after photographing @entity10 lift the trophy and celebrate with their fans i went to collect my remote camera from behind the goal and had realised it had been moved			0
' wondering why , i looked back through the images on the memory card to see if i 'd captured any of the goals when i realised that somebody had picked it up and used it to photograph some of the @entity10 players celebrating			0
' it was n't until i got back into the photographers room that somebody told me that it was in fact @entity0 who had turned from goalscorer to photographer ! although the pictures are bit soft i think for his first effort he 's done ok ! ' the photographer 's boss , @entity71 of @entity73 , remarked : ' players picking up cameras from behind the goal to take images of their team - mates after winning important matches at @entity12 has become almost as commonplace as selfies , but they are still intriguing images as it gives you an insight into how they might approach photography were the tables ever turned			1
' ' for the majority of the season , interaction between players and photographers on match - days is almost non-existent yet they all know we are there waiting to capture thepositive , negative , quirky and spectacular moments , so it is fascinating to see what they produce			0
' although @entity0 's images wo n't win any photographic awards , his attempts to photograph his team mates are probably better than @entity19 's attempts at scoring from long - range free kicks in a @entity44 ! ' but , this is n't the first time that a player has made use of a photographer 's cameras			1
at the @entity12 semi-final , @entity11 winger @entity113 also stepped behind the lens			2
after his side beat @entity118 's @entity117 , @entity113 took @entity38 's very own award - winning snapper @entity122 's unit from behind the goal and began clicking away			0
the final shots are perhaps less composed than @entity0 's efforts , but still likely to make his own personal photo album			0
perfect view : @entity122 's remote camera was behind the goal to get up close and personal action shots crowd shot : but our snapper got more than he bargained for has the @entity136 winger took over on our way ( back ) to @entity12 ! @entity113 's best effort is the now ubiquitous footballer 's mass selfie however , the most memorable act of camera theft must be @entity145 sprint legend @entity144 's typically showman celebration after wining gold at the @entity147			2
after crossing the finishing line ahead of compatriots @entity150 and @entity151 , the 25 - year - old dropped to the track and performed press - ups , before borrowing a photographer camera to take souvenir snapshots of the occasion			0
we suspect the final shots were taken for ' express ' development			0
@entity145 me smile : @entity144 also used a photographer 's camera after his gold winning sprint at @entity147 watch the birdie ! @entity144 used the oportunity to take snaps of his beaten rivals strike a pose ! @entity150 flexes for his countryman despite being beaten into second place in the 100m final			1

@entity10 came back to beat @entity11 3 - 2 to win the @entity3 at @entity12
@entity0 borrowed photographer 's camera to capture the moment
@entity17 *midfielder* 's final shot shows @entity30 and @entity33
