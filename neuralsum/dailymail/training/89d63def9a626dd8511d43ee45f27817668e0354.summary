by @entity0 @entity2 youngster @entity1 has completed a season - long loan move to @entity5 side @entity4			1
the 21 - year - old , who is the brother of established @entity2 star @entity7 , has spent the last two seasons on loan at @entity11 side @entity10			1
he won the @entity12 last season and was close to breaking into the national team ahead of the @entity15			1
@entity37 sporting director @entity36 told @entity38 last week : ‘ we were always going to make an attacking signing , no matter what the situation is with @entity42 and @entity43 , and this will be @entity1			0
‘ we have exchanged contracts with @entity2 and we have agreed with @entity1 , we have all agreed and now just need to sign the contracts			2
’ wanted man : hazard has attracted interest from a number of clubs in @entity5 and the @entity52 is he just there because of who his brother is ? not quite – it looked like a vanity move at first but the second of four footballing hazard brothers has impressed during a loan spell last season , leading him to this point			2
what has he done to show his potential ? he won the @entity28 player of the year award last season and narrowly missed out on a @entity15 squad spot behind @entity69			0
during his time with loan club @entity10 he was subject of a poaching attempt by @entity72 and even briefly was named club captain in a bizarre turn of events			0
will he ever make it at @entity2 ? it ’s proven difficult for anyone to break through at @entity79 after loan spells			0
@entity1 is still a long way from being a @entity83 star but @entity2 will hope this loan can act as a platform			1

@entity1 has completed a season - long loan move to the @entity89
the @entity2 winger has spent the last two seasons at @entity10
he won the @entity12 last season
