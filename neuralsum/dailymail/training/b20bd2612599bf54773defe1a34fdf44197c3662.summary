@entity1 police identified @entity35 and @entity15 as cousins			1
once @entity3 links a person to a crime , it 's virtually impossible for him or her to escape a guilty verdict			1
this is because that while 99.9 per cent of your @entity3 is identical to that of every other human being , the remaining 0.1 per cent is unique - and there 's a 1 in 100billion chance of a coincidental match			1

the dna profiling technique was developed by sir @entity80 at the @entity81 in the 1980s			0
a resulting investigation turned up the mistake by @entity84 , a veteran forensics scientist who handled the dna samples			0

@entity15 served four years before his release in 2006			0
@entity21 said @entity97 inmate @entity35 was linked to the break - in pending the new information but there were no plans to prosecute him in @entity102 for the decade - old case			1

but @entity21 said @entity84 had been placed on paid leave pending an internal police investigation and a review by the lab accrediting agency			2
attempts to contact @entity84 for comment were not immediately successful			0
authorities , in announcing the details of the case at a news conference yesterday , also said they released an internet video in an effort to explain further how such a mistake could have occurred			0
