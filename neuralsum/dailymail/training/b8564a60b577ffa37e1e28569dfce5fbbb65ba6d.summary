by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 02:12 est , 20 august 2012 for over a century scientists have been baffled by what caused the terrible disfigurement of the elephant man @entity4			1
but now they will attempt to unlock the secret of his suffering by analysing @entity8 from his bones - and hope to finally diagnose his condition			1
researchers intend to carry out tests next month to discover , if possible , @entity4 's genome sequence which will highlight any gene alteration			1
disfigured : @entity4 the @entity17 and his skeleton which could hold the key to his condition his skeleton has been preserved at the @entity21 in @entity22 since his death at the age of 27 in 1890 after a life of being regarded as a freak in @entity28 society			1
screen star : a scene from the 1980 film ' @entity17 starring @entity32 as @entity4 constant bleaching to keep it clean has degraded the bones , so scientists are facing a difficult task to get enough dna from the abnormal area of his skull			1
professor @entity40 , vice principal and executive dean at @entity42 is responsible for @entity4 's remains and is in charge of the research			1
he told the @entity46 : ' this is going to be extremely demanding			2
we need to know whether we can get sufficient [ genetic material ] from what we believe to be abnormal bone as well as sufficient from normal bone			2
' in doing it , we have an absolute regard to make sure we preserve the skeleton			2
we ca n't just mash a whole amount of it up			0
we have to preserve it for future generations because it 's an important historical record			0
' @entity4 's earned his nickname because he was believed to be suffering from @entity61 , a condition caused by a parasitic infection leading to thickening and enlargement of the skin and tissue			1
but in 2001,there was speculation that @entity4 suffered from a rare disease called @entity70 which causes skin overgrowth and abnormal bone development			1
@entity4 was born apparently health in @entity74 , but as he grew up his lips thickened and a bony lump grew on his forehead			1
he had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head			0
there was a significant difference between the size of his left and right hand and both his feet became enlarged			0
his speech became difficult to understand			0
finally , his parents and stepmother rejected him and forced him out onto the streets when he was 17			0
because of his deformities , he wore a hat and hood to hide his scary looks			0
to earn money he agreed to appear in a sideshow exhibited as a ' human curiosity '			1
@entity96 show : actor @entity97 plays the @entity17 without the aid of prosthetics by chance surgeon @entity100 who worked at @entity21 opposite the show , saw @entity4 and invited him to be examined and photographed			2
@entity4 later lived his final years at the hospital where he became a celebrity and no longer shunned by society			2
he was even visited by @entity104			0
the official cause of his death was asphyxia , although @entity100 , who dissected the body , said he had died of a dislocated neck			0
he believed that @entity4 had been attempting to sleep lying down , to ' be like other people '			2
in death , the @entity17 's story has fascinated the world			0
he was played by @entity32 in the 1980 film elephant man and @entity116 heart - throb @entity97 is currently starring on @entity96 in an adaptation of the screenplay .			0

they will extract @entity8 from his bones which could reveal his condition
@entity4 agreed to in sideshow which exhibited him as ' human curiosity '
