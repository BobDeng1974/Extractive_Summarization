manager @entity0 has revealed @entity1 will find out whether they will be deducted points for fielding an ineligible player before the weekend			1
the @entity4 were sanctioned by the @entity5 last week as they played @entity7 defender @entity6 in their 1 - 0 win over @entity9 on @entity10 after his youth loan had expired and the paperwork over an extension was not dealt with correctly			1
they have had to endure a nervy wait to discover their fate after the league said a disciplinary panel would hear the case at ' the earliest opportunity ' , while also indicating that the club will be open to the ' full range of punishments ' , which includes a potential points deduction			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 beleives a decision is imminent on a possible points deduction for his side on loan @entity7 defender @entity6 ( third right ) played in the 1 - 0 win over @entity9 on @entity10 the three - man panel is finally set to meet on thursday , with @entity0 expecting news of his club 's fate in the next 24 hours ' it 's going to happen very soon , ' the @entity41 , whose side host @entity40 on saturday , said			1
' it 's not my job to talk when it is and when it 's not , it will be soon enough			2
' i 've been told this morning that we hope it will be concluded by the time we arrive here on saturday , whether that 's today or tomorrow i am not 100 per cent sure			2
' the @entity4 have vowed to fight the charge , hiring top @entity54 @entity53 to defend them , but a three - point deduction is thought to be the likeliest punishment should they be found guilty			2
but @entity0 insists he does not know the strength of his club 's defence and has not been involved			1
@entity1 drew 1 - 1 with @entity61 on wednesday night , leaving them four points above the relegation zone ' i am not involved in the case , all i know is the chairman that has spent many hours heading the football club on this with a legal representative , i 've not been involved in any of the meetings because it is not my department , ' he added			1
' i have almost been kept at a distance			0
' you have to accept there 's been an error			0
certainly , knowing people inside this football club , no one means to make an error			0
' i do n't want to cast judgement on people who make genuine mistakes			0
i have made enough of them			0
i have often said that in my career and i mean it			0
