by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 14:46 est , 18 march 2014 dr @entity2 , the @entity3 tv doctor who presents @entity4 , tonight goes undercover in an alarming documentary , testing various therapies which claim to ' rid ' people of homosexuality			1
in the @entity11 documentary , undercover doctor : @entity12 , openly gay dr @entity2 explores the various controversial methods being deployed in the @entity3 and @entity15 to ‘ cure ’ gay patients			1
these include ' aversion therapy ' in @entity3 and ' gay rehab ' in the @entity15			2
this ‘ shock therapy ’ used to be deployed by doctors for treating homosexuality , ‘ since probably the 1920s , 30 , 40s and going on well into the 1970s and 80s , ’ dr @entity2 tells @entity49			1
patients were given injections every two hours which would make them vomit and have diarrhoea			2
the theory was that , afterwards , seeing images of naked men or having homosexual thoughts , would cause a physical reaction			2
no patients claimed to be cured by this method			0
‘ i ca n’t believe that people like me – a doctor – would actually prescribe this to people like me – gay , ’ dr @entity2 told this morning			1
the documentary then shows dr @entity2 visit the southern states of @entity15 , known as the @entity65			1
dr @entity2 drinks ipecac syrup to make him vomit during ' @entity35 ' ( left ) and waiting for the syrup to take affect , dr @entity2 sits in the doctor 's room , looking at images of naked men ( right ) dr @entity2 is handed ipecac syrup to drink ( left ) to make him vomit for hours whilst looking at pictures of naked men and listening to tapes telling him he is ‘ worthless , ’ because he is gay some in these deeply religious areas believe that being gay is a state of mind - one that can be treated			1
‘ the most shocking thing , was that these religious leaders do not believe we were born gay , but that it ’s a condition caused by childhood trauma , ’ says dr @entity2 in the documentary			1
worried about how these views would affect young people , dr @entity2 contacted many evangelistic churches within the @entity65 , but they refused to grant him interviews			1
instead , he spoke to young church - goers outside the building to ask their views			0
we see him speak to various teenagers , who stated that being gay is a ‘ state of mind			0
’ two teenage girls , aged 16 and 20 , explain that being gay ‘ happens when bad spirits are inside you			0
’ dr @entity2 is visibly upset by this			1
‘ imagine being gay and being told that ? ’ he says , before crying in frustration			0
‘ i think you should get me out of here , i ’ve had enough , ’ he says to the camera crew before walking away			0
‘ i ’d been doing reasonably well before then , keeping myself together and regarding all of this as just nonsense , ’ dr @entity2 tell @entity49			1
‘ rather stupidly , i thought younger people must share different views and i hoped to see some open - mindedness			0
‘ it saddened me deeply that this was n’t the case			0
‘ they do n’t come up with these ideas themselves , they are taught them , and that ’s incredibly worrying			0
‘ they go to schools where creationism is taught over evolution , it ’s unbelievable			0
’ during ‘ right brain therapy , ’ dr @entity2 went undercover , posing as ‘ @entity124 ’ , a gay man who wanted to be cured			1
he visited @entity126 , an ex-church pastor , who claims to be a doctor			0
however , as dr @entity2 found out , @entity126 has no medical qualifications beyond a minor degree in psychology			1
his ‘ right brain therapy , ’ which costs $ 250 , claims to spot how gay the patient actually is , and why , by getting them to colour in a drawing of a brain			2
@entity126 , an ex-church pastor , claims to be a doctor but , as dr @entity2 found out , has no medical qualifications beyond a minor degree in psychology			1
dr @entity2 watches videos of @entity126 , amazed at his ' @entity142 ' theories which he deems as ' nonsense ' posing as ‘ @entity124 , ’ dr @entity2 did this , with no prior medical consultation from @entity126 , who even admitted to being colour blind			1
‘ @entity124 ’ had to describe which part of the drawing he had filled in which colour			0
‘ he told me the parts i ’d drawn in black symbolised all the abuse i ’d had as a child , ’ says dr @entity2			1
‘ which is odd because i had a happy childhood and a lovely relationship with my parents			0
’ unbelievably , we see @entity126 tell ‘ @entity124 ’ that the thyroid gland ( the gland located in your neck ) and the adrenal gland ( located above the kidney ) are both located in the brain			0
‘ what a load of absolute nonsense , ’ says dr @entity2			1
‘ it ’s damaging because people watch his videos and actually think you can retrain the brain			0
’ dr @entity2 also investigated ‘ gay rehab			1
’ dr @entity2 visits @entity173 , who is now openly gay , but for years was married and living in denial			2
@entity173 used to run a rehabilitation programme for gay men before he accepted his sexuality and retired in 2007			0
' as with drug or alcohol rehabilitation , the rehab attempts to completely isolate the patient from his addiction , ’ explains dr @entity2			2
in @entity26 's documentary undercover doctor : @entity12 , dr @entity2 is tested at @entity184 in @entity185 to confirm that he is , in fact , ' 100 % gay			1
' wires are connected to dr @entity2 during an experiment at @entity184 in @entity185 to test his levels of homosexuality for $ 3,000 a month , @entity173 ’s three - month @entity197 programme would ‘ take the patient away from anything he deemed gay , ’ such as clothes and music			2
@entity173 then talks dr @entity2 through ' gay rehab ' , as if he were still conducting the course , rifling through his suitcase and discarding anything that might ' cause us to feel sensual or sexual			2
' sorting through dr @entity2 ’s cds , @entity173 claims that music ‘ rises up the senses , ’ so he should only listen to ‘ christian music			2
’ @entity173 says his @entity207 would be identified as ‘ not @entity208 , ’ and his @entity209 would be seen as equally inappropriate , as the singer is popular within the gay community			0
smid himself now admits : ' i ’ve never met a man who experienced a change from homosexual to heterosexual			0
' dr @entity2 says that he hopes the documentary raises awareness and helps the gay community feel more assured			1
‘ i hope young , vulnerable people who perhaps may have considered these therapies will watch the programme and realise it ’s all nonsense and they have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of , ’ he says			0
undercover doctor : @entity226 is on @entity11 tonight at 10pm			0
