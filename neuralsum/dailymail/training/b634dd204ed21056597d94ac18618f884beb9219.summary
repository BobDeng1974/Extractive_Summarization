by @entity0 a magnificent 164 by @entity1 led @entity2 to a @entity4 final , as they swept to an 83 - run win in saturday 's @entity7 semi-final against @entity9 at @entity10			1
the total of 353 for eight was 21 more than @entity2 had managed before in a one - day match , and @entity1 broke his own record for the highest individual score - the 150 not out he made in a 40 - over league match at @entity16 in 2011			1
@entity9 , who won the @entity19 final at @entity21 's last season , quickly slipped to 21 for two in reply and were all out for 270 , despite another sparkling century from one - day captain @entity23			1
smashing : @entity1 blasted 24 boundaries in his record - breaking innings for @entity2 @entity26 : despite a difficult summer with the bat for @entity30 this was @entity1 ' second county hundred superb : the @entity30 all - rounder flays a shot through the covers during the sparkling innings he followed his unbeaten 146 in the quarter - final win against @entity37 by making 114 before he was last out in the 47th over			1
but @entity23 was involved in two calamitous run - outs straight after he and @entity39 had taken 20 off the 39th over , bowled by @entity40			1
the 30 - over scores were identical on 158 for three and in the next over @entity42 reached 50 with a six off @entity43			2
the ball was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by @entity46 , but his foot had touched the rope			0
the stand with @entity23 was worth 97 , but @entity42 sat back to cut the next ball and edged to @entity51			2
that proved crucial as the pressure to match @entity2 's late onslaught saw @entity56 drive @entity43 to long - on			2
then @entity57 cracked a catch to extra cover before @entity39 and @entity60 were run out			0
after losing three of their first four games in the competition , @entity2 will now face @entity65 on september 20 hoping for a repeat of their one previous appearance in a lord 's final , when they beat @entity70 in the 2007 @entity71			1
en route to that final they posted their previous best @entity75 total - 332 for four - at home to @entity77			0
hero : @entity1 is congratulated by the @entity80 crowd after his match - winning knock chopping on : @entity43 is bowled for a duck but the damage had been done by @entity85 fightback : @entity23 led the @entity88 charge after early wickets with some inventive shot - making turning point : @entity42 , who played well for his 52 , is caught behind off the bowling of @entity43 @entity1 ' 113 - ball blitz on saturday included six sixes			1
dropped on 12 by @entity39 , standing up to the medium pace of @entity95 , his first 50 came off 47 balls , the second off 37 and the third off 21			0
he dominated a fourth - wicket stand of 135 with @entity51 , although it was the wicketkeeper who launched the attack which started when they took the five - over batting powerplay after 35 overs			0
@entity51 had not hit a boundary for 18 overs but suddenly smashed @entity108 for four , six , four and @entity2 all but doubled their score in the last 15 overs , which produced 174 runs			2
@entity51 was run out for 89 in the 40th , but by that stage @entity9 did not know where to bowl at @entity1			0
their three seamers - @entity108 , @entity120 and @entity60 - conceded a total of 240 in 29 overs , while @entity95 was relatively frugal with 47 off 10			0
early - morning rain cleared in time for play to begin promptly at 1030 and , under heavy cloud , @entity9 chose to field			0
hitting out : @entity23 continued his superb form with a very good century but it was n't enough all round performance : it was fitting that @entity1 took the final wicket to win the match with the ball @entity133 launched @entity2 's innings with 36 off 29 balls before @entity120 , who had conceded 23 in three overs , switched ends and swung one in to bowl @entity133 off his pads with the score on 61 in the 10th			1
@entity1 went in at 92 for three in the 15th over and scored 70 of the next 87 runs			2
there was a touch of finesse about an early leg glance , but he was soon striking the ball with brutal power off the back foot through the off side			0
@entity95 and @entity42 kept things reasonably tight until @entity1 drove the left - arm spinner to the extra-cover boundary then launched him over long - on for six			2
that was the only maximum in his 84 - ball hundred , but five more followed before he fell to the last ball of the 49th over , driving @entity60 to long - on			1
in the fourth over of the reply @entity160 edged @entity163 to @entity51 , then @entity40 nipped one back to bowl @entity95			0
@entity164 , sent in at three , made 22 off 33 balls before he fell lbw trying to sweep in @entity43 's first over			0
the off - spinner finished with three for 53 and will fulfil his wish to end his 11 - year @entity2 career at @entity4 .			1

@entity30 stars dominate as @entity2 win by 83 runs
@entity1 blasts six sixes in his magnificent 113 - ball innings
@entity23 scores 114 but @entity88 fall well short in semi-final
@entity2 will face @entity65 in @entity4 final
