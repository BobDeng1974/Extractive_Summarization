by @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 published : 12:31 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 02:43 est , 5 february 2013 @entity4 ’s move to play football in @entity2 has landed him in a row over taxes			2
the 37 - year - old says he will receive just the minimum wage while the rest of his pay package is donated to charity			0
the deal means that high @entity14 taxes do not make a dent in his fortune while he plays for @entity17			1
this has angered many @entity14 , including one mp who mocked @entity4 ’s accountant for saying the former @entity22 captain will work for only £ 2,000 a month			1
‘ he will be paid less than my parliamentary assistant ! ’ said conservative @entity23			0
‘ be serious ! ’ controversy : @entity4 's deal with @entity17 - which means he will pay the vast majority of his salary to charity - has caused uproar among some @entity14 mps deal : under @entity14 law @entity17 must pay @entity4 the minimum wage so that national insurance and other charges go the government @entity4 ’s arrangement involves limiting his contract to five months , keeping his family based in @entity41 , and saying he will give his salary to charity			1
all of this enables both @entity4 and @entity17 to concentrate on making millions from the @entity46 captain ’s image rights , while paying far less tax			1
the £ 2,000 - a - month salary represents the minimum wage for professional footballers in @entity14			2
mr @entity23 added : ‘ it is necessary to convince the sports minister to stop this deadly tax process			0
i ’d rather receive 50 per cent of a lot than 75 per cent of nothing ! ’ @entity4 will give about £ 700,000 a month of wages to charity – but it is understood that @entity17 will pay this direct , and not the player			1
this , along with the fact @entity4 will not live in @entity14 for longer than six months , ensures he will not become liable for a 1.5 per cent tax on his worldwide income and estimated wealth of £ 200million – a possible bill of £ 3million			1
money - spinner : the deal does n't prevent @entity4 and @entity17 making money from his commercial rights with his shirts selling for around £ 100 @entity70 , a @entity71 mp , insisted that @entity14 would benefit in the long run from @entity4 being in @entity2			1
‘ me , i see a symbol , ' he said			0
' he will create wealth around @entity17 , image rights , jerseys sold by @entity17			0
this is proof that the tax system in @entity14 does not leak			0
’ both @entity4 and @entity17 will be able to make money from the @entity46 captain ’s image rights and other commercial activities			1
his share of merchandising rights is likely to be paid into one of the three @entity41 - based companies			0
@entity86 , which exploits @entity4 ’s name and image , including work for @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , paid him nearly £ 86million in salary and dividends from 2002 to 2010			1
@entity17 is already promoting @entity4 shirts on the club ’s website , with an adult top featuring his name and number costing almost £ 100			2
@entity102 , the biggest sports paper in the country , has already suggested that ‘ football ’s glamour icon ’ was little more than a money - spinning fairground attraction			0
it carried a cartoon of the ‘ s ’ in @entity17 turned into a dollar sign last week , and wrote : ‘ with the signature of the spice boy @entity4 yesterday , @entity17 pulled off a sensational publicity stunt			2
the sporting interest of the move is less clear			0
’ others were even more cruel – with @entity118 newspaper branding @entity4 a ‘ third - hand @entity119 ’ .			0

deal *criticised* by @entity14 mps because star will pay virtually no income tax
vast majority of £ *170,00* a week salary to be paid directly to *children* 's charity
@entity4 and @entity17 can still make money from merchandise with lower taxes
