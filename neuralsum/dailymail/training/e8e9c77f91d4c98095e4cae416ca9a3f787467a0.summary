@entity0 is writing a boxing sitcom , which he says is a mix of @entity3 and @entity4			1
as a fan of storytelling , he believes his own career is following a far darker path but insists it will have a happy ending			2
two successive defeats by arch - rival @entity12 have left @entity13 at a critical point in his journey and , with a world title eliminator looming next saturday , he knows a third loss would be fatal for his career			1
‘ if it was @entity21 , we are still only one book in , ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s been a half - decent read but it gets better — a lot better — it may get a bit darker but we ’re on our way and there are plenty more chapters to put together			2
i do n’t quite know what is going to happen yet but we ’re not even halfway through the series			2
‘ losing this fight is a much more frightening prospect than losing to @entity12 , ’ says @entity0 , 26			1
‘ this is a must - win fight			2
the second @entity12 fight in many ways was an event bigger than boxing , it created such an atmosphere , such hype , it captured the public ’s imagination and everyone seemed to be interested			1
but in the bigger scheme of things , this is the biggest fight of my life			2
’ win on saturday and @entity0 would be the mandatory challenger for the @entity67 super-middleweight title and back on course possibly to end 2014 as a world champion			1
but @entity0 is well aware that fairy - tales rarely happen			1
@entity12 lands a punch on @entity0 in the biggest fight in @entity46 boxing history during their bout in may @entity0 was brutally knocked out in the eight round of a second successive defeat to arch - rival @entity12 his first world - title shot last november ended in a controversial ninth - round stoppage , while the may rematch with @entity12 finished with him sprawled on the canvas in front of 77,000 people and millions more across the globe			1
‘ it was a strange feeling , numbing — and not just literally , ’ he says			2
‘ you prepare mentally , physically and emotionally for a fight and it was the first time i ’ve really experienced it when will and tenacity and grit and hunger are n’t enough			2
‘ my first thought was that i had let the whole team down and let my family down			2
we had worked so hard for that opportunity — it was the perfect time for me to arrive — i know other opportunities will come but that was the one i wanted			2
@entity0 has a @entity100 in his gym like the one he pulled out during a press conference with @entity12 the @entity103 has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring ‘ @entity107 was devastating and the first time i saw @entity108 [ @entity109 , his promoter ] i said sorry			1
but he said all the right things and told me to go away , have a break and not think about boxing			2
the next day my wife and me flew to @entity115 but i could tell @entity108 was working on a comeback fight			1
he did n’t want to bother me but i ’m there sending him texts about who and when i think i should be boxing next			0
‘ i just wanted to get stuck into training again as soon as possible			0
the @entity12 fight was n’t a physically brutal fight where you needed months to recover from injuries or cuts — it was probably the least aching fight i ’ve ever had — and i was literally back in the gym a week later			1
‘ it was harder to recover mentally and emotionally			0
i was expecting to crash and start thinking i needed a break or start feeling sorry for myself			0
but as time went on i realised that is not really who i am			0
i got knocked out , it happens but that does n’t mean i need to start doubting myself or feeling sorry for myself			0
‘ it has not necessarily been about going back to the drawing board and changing myself too much as a fighter			1
it ’s about becoming more emotionally strong			0
‘ i ’m always going to be sad about losing and i ’ll never get over that			0
but i do n’t want to			0
i ’m not a person who is content in life — i always want to be better and achieve more and i ’m certainly more determined now			0
’ @entity0 appears relaxed but focused as he trains ahead of his @entity48 title fight with @entity36 @entity142 and abrasive in the build - up to both fights with @entity12 , @entity0 is much quieter in person and at times is barely audible as trains rattle above his west @entity149 gym			1
he remains as confident as ever though			0
‘ if someone said : “ do you want to fight @entity12 next month ” i ’d say : “ 100 per cent ” and i ’d tell everyone i ’d knock him out and believe it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i trust in my abilities , my work ethic and in my ambition to improve and become the most complete fighter i can be			0
‘ i still feel i will be considered a great fighter one day , that ’s the goal and that has n’t changed off the back of two losses			1
i have a deep , ignorant conviction that i ’m a great fighter and nobody has yet been able to prove to me that is n’t the case			0
’ asked where this confidence and resilience stems from , @entity0 cites the support of wife @entity172 , who interrupts the interview to ensure @entity0 eats his avocado and salmon salad lunch , and parents @entity176 and @entity178			1
it is a close - knit family and @entity0 admits the defeats have been hard for his loved ones			1
‘ i know they were devastated and it must have been tough especially for my dad — he re-decorated the gym before i got back from @entity115 because he wanted it to be like a fresh start , which was sweet			1
the 26 - year - old lands a punch onto @entity12 during their first bout which was controversially stopped @entity0 was stopped in the ninth round in his first fight with @entity12 , prompting immediate calls for a rematch ‘ my parents are not necessarily confident people			1
if you go on holiday with them they ’re not the ones up on stage doing karaoke or anything like that , but at the same time they ’ve always encouraged me to be the best i can be			0
' they ’ve given me loads of love and support and that obviously develops confidence.anything i know i ’m good at , i ’m happy to stand in front of a crowd and show off			0
ask me to sing or dance and i ’d start sweating but , when it comes to boxing , i know what i ’m doing			0
’ hanging in his gym is a symbol of that : the @entity100 he pulled out during the build - up to the second @entity12 fight			1
it was a moment that simultaneously demonstrated @entity0 ’ ability to sell a fight and play mind games with an opponent			1
‘ all that was good fun but it ’s nice to have a break from it			0
i feel i know how to tell a story and take people on a journey and that is what you want in boxing			0
@entity225 is very good at it , there ’s always some sort of controversy ahead of his fights and that is what keeps him interesting and relevant			0
when my time comes — when i win the @entity67 title and maybe challenge for a unification fight — i ’ll embrace it			1
’ @entity0 has always enjoyed mind games and is always able to sell a fight as this @entity100 's cube stunt shows @entity13 ’ antics outside the ring saw him cast as an arrogant upstart but two heroic performances won much admiration and respect			1
‘ i ’m a much more high - profile boxer now — people are excited about me and want to come see me box			0
but the flipside is would i trade all that for two wins and a world title ? of course			2
you want to become a world champion			0
but you also want to entertain and fight for the fans — so if i ’m in more big fights that is just as exciting to me			0
’ and @entity0 has not given up on a third instalment with @entity12 next year			1
he said : ‘ if i had knocked him out i ’d have been satisfied with that but he ’s not satisfied because he knows he was getting beaten up until that point			0
take nothing away from @entity12 , he found the target with the best punch of his career , but maybe there ’s a part of him that thinks : “ i wish it was n’t so lucky ”			1
‘ at various times since the last fight he has had swipes at me , the latest one being that i was n’t the fighter he was and he was the superstar , but his fight has n’t been announced yet			2
he ’s rolling around on tv in tights and we ’ll see how well he does when his tickets go on sale			0
we ’re not friends , he does n’t like me			0
i feel there is a possibility a third fight could happen			0
’ whether @entity0 gets the chance remains to be seen			1
for now , he must make sure the next chapter of his story is a happy one			0
