her mother , @entity10 , left @entity6 and her twin sister with their father , @entity12 , while she went shopping			1

@entity6 died at home in these flats in @entity8 , @entity9 , after falling between a bed and a radiator she wept as she told @entity25 that @entity6 had ' definitely been moved ' from between pillows on the bed - possibly when her two - year - old son , @entity28 , had gone looking for toys			1
ms @entity6 said : ' he came at about 9am , or 9.30am			2
i had fed @entity6 and winded her and i went into the living room where @entity33 was feeding @entity34 and i said " you 're going to be fine are n't you ? " and he said " yes "			2
' @entity6 was in the bed in the master bedroom			1
i 'd put a pillow to the left and one to the right of her so she could n't move			2
' she went out shopping with her son @entity41 but became alarmed when at 11.30am her ex , mr @entity12 , stopped answering her call and she returned home just before 2pm			0
sobbing , ms @entity6 added : ' when i went into the block i just had this gut feeling that something was wrong and i grabbed @entity41 and ran up the stairs			2
' i was knocking at the door for what felt like forever			0
when he opened the door , i could tell that he had just woken up			0
' when i looked in the bedroom i could n't see @entity6 at all , and by this time i was shouting at him " where 's @entity6 ? "			1
' when i went back into the bedroom i just saw a pink vest and then saw her down the side of the bed			2
' i was just screaming and before i knew it @entity33 was telling me how to resuscitate her from what they were telling him on the phone , and then the next thing i remember is my dad coming in			0
' @entity25 , pictured , heard that @entity6 's mother , @entity10 , discovered her body after returning from a shopping trip paramedics rushed the baby to hospital where she was briefly revived before being pronounced dead			1
ms @entity6 told the inquest : ' she was definitely moved			1
there is no way she could have moved from where i left her , she was only three months old			0
' after she died i thought about this all the time			0
how did she get there ? i do n't know what happened but i do n't think @entity33 hurt her - there 's no possible way			0
' i believe that if she had n't got down the side of the bed she would still be here			0
' mr @entity12 told the inquest he had last checked on @entity6 at about 1pm , but then he fell asleep while feeding her twin sister in the living room and watching cartoons with his two - year - old son @entity28			1
he said : ' there 's no way she could have moved from between the pillows			0
' @entity28 was two at the time and the door to the bedroom was a little bit open so i could hear her [ @entity6 ]			2
' he goes in there sometimes to get his toys so he might have gone in there			0
' a post-mortem revealed @entity6 had been starved of oxygen and must have lain face down for up to an hour after her death			1

you ca n't stay with them forever , nobody would expect you to			0
' the coroner said she was satisfied that @entity6 was left on the bed in ' an entirely safe position ' and that the tot had suffocated after becoming wedged			1
recording a short narrative verdict , she added : ' @entity6 was a well - nourished and healthy child with no underlying medical conditions that contributed to her death			1
' when she was found , the majority of her body was lower than the mattress and her face was pressed against the side of the mattress			0
ms @entity6 later found a wet patch on the mattress there			2
' i have heard evidence that [ mr @entity12 ] had had a late night and i 'm satisfied that it was nearer to two hours since he last checked on @entity6			2
' someone had been responsible for directly or indirectly moving her and i have heard that it could have been merely a bounce on the bed			0
' she must have been moved into a different position but with no specific intention to harm her			0
' miss @entity100 recorded that @entity6 died when she was left on an adult bed without supervision , and that the medical cause of death was postural asphyxia .			1
