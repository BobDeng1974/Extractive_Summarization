you might not agree about everything but you can have a conversation with him			0

’ ‘ on one level i have a sense of slight relief as i do not have to get myself into a high security prison which is not a very nice experience			1
‘ on the other level i ’m sad that the conversations we have been having for the last twelve or eleven years will come to an end			1
i do n’t know how much it ’ll be possible to keep contact with him			0

’ these comments were , @entity8 said yesterday ‘ rather outrageous ’			2

moving on : @entity7 was cleared for extradition to the @entity14 yesterday by the @entity156 , pictured , along with four other terror suspects the training camp charges are , @entity8 said on the ‘ wider edges of credibility ’			1
‘ i never ever speak to him about that business in the @entity166			0
we did speak about this so - called training camp in @entity162 which does seem to me to be on the wider edges of credibility			0
‘ given that he is here , i know you can organise all kinds of things on the internet these days			0
but organising a training camp is quite a detailed thing that you have to do			0
‘ and he i think felt that somebody else had been telling stories about him to implicate him			0
