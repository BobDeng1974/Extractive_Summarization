a @entity1 couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the @entity4 , so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck			1
@entity9 and @entity10 purchased a 1986 @entity12 flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love			1
the result was a solar - powered two - bedroom , wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self - sufficiently in @entity22 , @entity1			1
how a truck becomes a home : a @entity1 couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck making do : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own , but could n't afford to buy a full - sized lot ' we came back to @entity1 from the @entity4 in 2009 , ' @entity10 told @entity34			1
' we knew we could n't afford to buy property at that point			0
we did n't have money			0
' so , the couple started building			1
after a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time , the project took shape			2
though , to hear @entity9 tell it , they just slapped up the place in a weekend			2
' [ we ] welded a frame , put the wood on and built this house , ' the modest @entity52 told @entity34 's @entity53			0
once they finished , the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they 'd purchased in @entity22 , @entity1			1
now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature : aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door			2
ingenuity : the couple started with a steel frame and slowly , project by project , built a home in about a year and a half gorgeous : @entity9 and @entity10 now have a gorgeous , wood - lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook details : the couple has a wood - fired stove to keep out the cold , stained glass windows and other creature comforts they 're nearly self - sufficient , too			1
the home is powered mostly by solar panels			0
@entity10 said their first power bill was just $ 25			2
the stove and hot water are gas - powered and water comes from a nearby spring			0
' i did n't want to live inside a plastic box , ' @entity10 said			2
' not because i 'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be			0
' all told , the project cost @entity9 and @entity10 about $ 25,000			1
and the couple even plans to build another one like one day			0
' it 's really , really nice , ' @entity9 said			0
' two bedrooms : the home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps green : water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels			0

@entity9 and @entity10 needed a place to live after they moved back to @entity1 from the @entity4 in 2009
so , they purchased a 1986 @entity12 flatbed truck and started building a home on the back of it over the course of about a year and a half
they then purchased a *secluded* piece of property and drove their nearly self - sufficient $ 25,000 home there
