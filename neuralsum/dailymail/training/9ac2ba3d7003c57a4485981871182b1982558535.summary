only a handful of participants actually make it , out of around fifty people a week who take on the challenge the chicken is laced with the infamous ' @entity7 ' chilli it may sound like a breeze at just six chicken wings in 10 minutes - but @entity12 's hottest ' hot - wing challenge ' is so tough participants must sign a waiver before taking part			1
each wing is laced with the infamous @entity7 chilli - a pepper 250 times hotter than a jalapeno			1
around 50 diners take on the challenge , and , like @entity22 pictured here , must sign a waiver - form before they brave the feat. @entity26 takes on the chilli chicken wings challenge at @entity28 on @entity29 it registers a huge 1.3m on the @entity33 scale for chilli heat and is so corrosive it has to be handled with gloves			1
the challenge is a mainstay on the menu at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity40			2
owner @entity41 said the recipe - which also contains garlic , lime , orange and butter - was inspired by ' taste , adrenaline and euphoria '			2
@entity26 signs a waiver form before he takes on the chilli challenge ' there are very specific rules for the @entity54 , which are the same for everybody and which we are very tough on , ' he said			1
' there are six hot wings and 10 minutes to eat them			0
' by eating them you have to pick them up and eat them off the bone - you are not allowed to remove the meat from the bone first			0
' you are not allowed to leave the table , you are not allowed anything to drink			0
' once you have eaten the wings we stop the clock and start a fresh clock and there is a five minute burn - time where the same rules apply			0
' you do all that and you become a champion			0
' out of all the people who take on the hot wings challenge each week , only about two or three succeed			1
the restaurant 's other challenge is ' the @entity83 '			2
this pits hungry diners against an 8in burger , large fries and milkshake in 10 minutes .			0
