by @entity0 he 's the singing @entity2 who uses @entity4 to spread the word of the @entity6 , and he 's now being tipped as a contender to become the first @entity8			0
@entity10 cardinal @entity9 , @entity12 's most prominent @entity11 leader , sings on stage , preaches on tv and reduces churchgoers to laughter and tears with his often light - hearted sermons			1
with his down - to - earth , personable manner , @entity9 , nicknamed ' @entity21 ' by his adoring followers , seems a world apart from the conservative @entity2 and @entity24 of @entity25 and @entity26			1
contender : @entity10 cardinal @entity9 is being tipped to become the first @entity12 pope on the pulse : the @entity2 's @entity4 page @entity4 page advertising his televised sunday sermons his compassion for the poor and unassuming ways have impressed followers in his homeland , @entity12 's largest @entity11 nation , and church leaders in the @entity39			1
despite this his chances of becoming @entity41 are considered remote , as many believe that @entity43 or @entity44 - with their faster growing @entity11 flocks - would be more logical choices if the papal electors look beyond @entity25			1
but even the hint of papal consideration has electrified many in the heavily @entity51 , where past pontiffs had been welcomed by millions with rock - star intensity			0
' it 'll bring such immense glory to us and our country , ' said @entity58 , one of several waiters at a @entity61 restaurant in @entity63 's suburban @entity62 who served dinner to @entity66 when he visited in 1995			0
the restaurant has displayed the set of spoon , fork , table napkin , water goblet and knives - still unwashed after the pope 's meal of grilled fish and fried shrimp			0
the talks surrounding @entity9 have been fueled by prominent @entity39 experts , who see in the boyish - looking cardinal the religious zest , stamina , charisma and communications skills that could energize the church facing crises on many fronts			1
appointment : @entity9 receives his biretta hat from @entity66 @entity90 as he is made a cardinal in november last year personable : @entity9 , seen here with fellow @entity10 cardinal @entity93 , has impressed church leaders in the @entity39 with his compassion for the poor @entity97 , a @entity39 analyst and author of ' the @entity99 , ' said the selection of @entity101 - born @entity66 in 1979 shows the ' unthinkable ' can occur once the cardinals are closed off in the conclave			1
' there are people , even @entity39 officials here , who have whispered to me , ` @entity9 , he 's the man , '' @entity97 told @entity109			1
when asked about the papal buzz , @entity9 demurred : ' only a speculation			1
' ' he 's an effective communicator and missionary at a time when @entity118 's highest internal priority is a new evangelization , ' @entity112 , a @entity113 - based analyst , wrote for the @entity120 ' @entity9 incarnates the dramatic growth of @entity118 outside the @entity122 , putting a face on the dynamic and relatively angst - free form of @entity118 percolating in the @entity125 , ' he said			1
' he would certainly be a symbol of the church in the emerging world , but given his intellectual and personal qualities , hardly a hollow one			0
' still , @entity9 's relative youth - at 55 , he 's the second youngest among the cardinals - could be a liability			1
@entity2 could be reluctant to risk giving the reins of the @entity39 to someone who could reign for decades			2
the churchman who last caught the deep adoration of many @entity10 @entity11 was cardinal @entity138 , who died in 2005			1
a beloved spiritual leader and moral compass , @entity138 helped rally multitudes in the massive ' people power ' revolts that ousted two presidents , including dictator @entity145 in 1986			0
@entity9 waits for the start of a vespers celebration in @entity148 at the @entity39 yesterday @entity138 's death left a vacuum in the church saddled with the task of shepherding @entity11 in a country plagued by poverty , divisions , crimes and long - raging @entity158 and @entity159 insurgencies			1
unlike @entity138 , @entity9 was not propelled by any extraordinary events			2
but people who know him say that @entity9 slowly carved a reputation for simple , day - to - day acts that defined him as a man of deep faith and intellect			2
the younger of two children of a pious @entity11 couple who worked in a bank , @entity9 dreamed of becoming a doctor			1
but he was redirected by a @entity172 friend to the priesthood at a seminary in the upscale @entity175 , where he graduated summa cum laude , according to his theology professor , the rev. @entity177			0
he 's gifted with great communications skills			0
a wonderful storyteller with a bent for music , @entity9 speaks fluent @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			2
he also has proficient @entity185 and can say @entity186 in @entity187			0
but he prefers to stay in the background			0
' he 's not somebody who sort of wants to , by personality , put himself at the center of the stage , ' @entity177 said			2
' now , if he 's called to be in front , he has all the capability of doing it			0
' @entity9 took clear positions on church and social issues but was never confrontational or ' super militant , ' @entity177 said			1
for instance , he encouraged dialogue when he helped lead an unsuccessful church campaign against the government - endorsed health plan that promotes contraceptives			0
@entity9 was ordained in 1982 and became bishop in 2001 at an old cathedral , about a block from his family 's home in @entity211 just south of @entity63			1
aside from his church work , he taught theology in a hilltop seminary , where he lived for about two decades , staying in a room that had no television or air - conditioning , according to seminary staffers			0
even as a bishop , @entity9 did not own a car			2
he took the bus or ' jeepney , ' the popular working - class minibus , to church and elsewhere			0
he ate with workers and sang for a church charity , impressing many with his baritone voice			0
@entity9 stood out for his powerful homilies			2
a few years ago , he started hosting a sunday gospel show on tv , where he preached and answered questions			0
staffers then opened a @entity4 page for him , which has jumped to more than 120,000 followers			0
@entity9 's path at some point crossed with the future pope , then - cardinal @entity90 , who introduced him to @entity66 and reportedly assured the pontiff in jest that the @entity10 with a youthful face has received his first communion			1
@entity90 appointed @entity9 as a member of the @entity39 's @entity244 , or @entity245 , and was impressed with his research work and papers			1
' i am sure that it was because of what he saw in him at the @entity245 that @entity66 @entity90 chose him for @entity63 and then for the red hat ' of a cardinal , said the rev. @entity254 , one of @entity9 's instructors at @entity256			1
in october 2011 , @entity90 declared @entity9 the new archbishop of @entity63 , then just a year later , elevated him to cardinal			1
@entity9 tearfully acknowledged in a recent homily in @entity211 that he was overwhelmed by his rapid rise			2
' it 's unnerving , ' he said			0
larger audiences have turned up to listen to his talks and homilies , where he often raised the need for the @entity11 to reconnect with people			2
almost always , @entity9 is mobbed like a movie star by fans jostling to get his picture			2
' i think many of the cardinals will say , ` it 's too much , too soon , '' the professor @entity177 said of @entity9 's chances in the conclave			1
but he added : ' we do n't know what @entity277 wants			0
if @entity277 wants it , @entity277 will make up for it			0

however many believe an @entity44 or @entity293 is more likely
