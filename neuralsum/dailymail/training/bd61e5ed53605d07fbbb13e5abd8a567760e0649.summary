by @entity0 published : 15:52 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 15:52 est , 10 april 2013 last autumn , six weeks after my twin daughters @entity3 and @entity4 were born , i telephoned my mum for a chat			1
ever since my husband @entity8 and i had brought our daughters home — they were born seven weeks prematurely — i ’d been breastfeeding every three hours , day and night			1
i was desperate for sleep			1
‘ do n’t you think it ’s time you tried them on a little formula ? ’ @entity17 suggested			1
‘ it will free you up to get more sleep and @entity8 will be able to help more ’			2
my throat tightened as i admitted that she was right , and after i ’d hung up the phone i burst into tears			2
putting my babies on formula meant — in my tired eyes , at least — that i ’d failed as a mum			1
pressure to breastfeed : mothers who bottle feed their babies have been labelled ' lazy ' , ' selfish ' and even ' stupid ' reluctantly , i sloped off to the supermarket and carefully studied the labels on every brand of formula milk			1
as i read the sides of the packets , the overriding sense of guilt heightened			2
the most popular infant formulas have more than 40 ingredients and you ’d need a biochemistry degree to understand them all			2
demineralised whey , galacto - oligosaccharides , potassium chloride , choline chloride , taurine , emulsifier , fish oil , cytidine 5			2
what on earth was i giving my babies ? i remember trying not to catch the checkout woman ’s eyes			2
at home , i scooped out the powder and watched it dissolve in the hot water			2
later , as i fed it to them from tiny bottles , i imagined what damage it was doing to their little premature insides and wept			1
today , eight months on , i realise just how ridiculous i was being			2
lack of sleep and perhaps mild postnatal depression meant i completely overreacted			2
my girls are healthy , thriving and are now , like thousands of other babies , fed exclusively on powdered milk			2
but i feel for any other new mums wrestling with similar guilt - ridden anxieties this week			2
rationing : supermarkets are trying to prevent the bulk buying of formula milk so it ca n't be sent on to the @entity80 for a profit as news emerges that supermarkets are rationing popular brands to prevent formula being bought in bulk and shipped to @entity87 , where it can fetch three times the price , the ‘ breastapo ’ are out in force , berating the formula - feeding pariahs who feed our babies this manufactured ‘ poison ’			1
we have been labelled ‘ lazy ’ , ‘ selfish ’ and even ‘ stupid ’			1
after all , let ’s face it , fellow formula mums , we have probably brought this crisis on ourselves			1
the competitive mum in me was slightly irked that i did n’t manage to reach the full six months with breast milk the restrictions — requested by the manufacturers @entity105 , who make @entity107 and @entity108 – come after students and businessmen were found to be bulk - buying the tins and sending them to @entity87 , where contamination scares mean that parents trust @entity115 brands more than their own			2
shops now insist that parents buy a maximum of two tins of formula per day , per shop			1
security guards have even been hired in some shops to ensure that worried parents do n’t return to the same store twice in a day			2
i ’ve been aware of this since last month , after a rather worrying episode when we were snowed in at my parents - in - laws ’ country cottage for six days			2
there ’s no other feeling like the gnawing , primeval fear that you might not be able to feed your babies — a fear many mothers will be experiencing when they arrive at the baby aisle in the supermarket to find the shelves empty			1
once again , i felt guilty for having stopped breastfeeding in the first place , and in a panic i despatched my husband on foot to buy at least four boxes			0
my girls get through a box every two days , so we always bulk - buy			0
he returned hours later with only two packets , informing me of the new ‘ rule ’			0
this is indeed worrying news for formula - feeding mums , and especially mums of multiples who get through several tins a week			1
after all , if our own milk has dried up , we ca n’t simply buy a carton of semi-skimmed and give that to our children			0
babies under one ca n’t tolerate cow ’s milk			0
as i read yesterday ’s headlines , i pictured armies of mums looting branches of @entity172			0
at nearly £ 10 a box for some brands , formula feeding is not cheap			1
but on @entity179 , boxes of @entity108 , @entity107 and @entity177 and @entity178 are going for more than double their shelf price			0
there is a telling line at the bottom of each listing — ‘ @entity185 ’			0
yet while such profiteering is to be condemned , the comments the crisis has elicited on some online forums make me even angrier			1
‘ if you want your kid to have second - rate milk , that is up to you in my opinion , ’ says one			0
from another : ‘ has anyone tasted baby formula ? i would n’t give it to my cat			1
’ breast is best : but not all mothers are able to breastfeed and do n't need a guilt trip well thank you , ladies			1
i feel so much better about my decision now			0
my girls were born seven weeks prematurely and spent their first 17 days in a special care baby unit			0
determined to do all i could to help them survive , i knew breastfeeding was my only option			0
i could reel off the benefits by heart — it halved their chances of asthma , reduced the risk of cot death , would help raise their iq			0
the list went on and on			0
at the hospital , it was heartbreaking as i was separated from my babies for 24 hours while they lay in incubators and i recovered from my c - section in the maternity unit			0
but if i could n’t be with them , at least i could ensure that they had my colostrum ( the ‘ high - octane ’ milk packed full of antibodies to protect newborns ) which i painstakingly expressed over the course of several hours to send up to them			0
after that , although i could n’t put them to my breast , i could at least express milk			0
when that ran out temporarily , they drank breast milk donated by other mothers			1
when i brought @entity3 and @entity4 home , there was no question that i would breastfeed them both , ideally for the first six months			1
but it was not to be			0
my milk production could not keep up with their demands and because they were premature , the feeding regime of every three hours meant i was utterly exhausted			1
follow the rules in the @entity253 , infant formula advertising has been illegal since 1995 , but advertising for ' follow - on formula ' is legal we started combined feeding of breast and bottle			1
at first i gave them one bottle of formula a day and gradually this grew to two , to three and four , until today when they are entirely on bottled milk			1
the competitive mum in me was slightly irked that i did n’t manage to reach the full six months with breast milk			0
instead , i ‘ only ’ got to five months , three weeks			0
i know i should heed the advice of my fantastic health visitor , who told me encouragingly : ‘ give yourself a huge pat on the back			0
’ but the feeling that i ’m not feeding my children the ‘ natural ’ way has never left me			0
and i ’m not alone			0
my colleague and fellow formula mum , @entity278 , recently wrote about the pressure she felt from the breastfeeding nazis even before her daughter , @entity281 , was born last year			1
she attended a @entity283 class and dared to ask if there was any information for mothers about bottle - feeding , as a few friends had had problems			1
‘ the lovely woman in charge of the group looked embarrassed and explained that the organisation takes the same stance as the @entity295 , which has decreed that all its employees take a vow of silence on the issue , ’ she wrote			0
‘ then and since , even when it was clear for medical reasons that i would have to bottle - feed , no one would advise me			0
’ i am no big fan of formula milk companies , whose aggressive marketing in the @entity307 is well documented			1
but the ‘ breastapo ’ have no right to make mothers like me feel inferior			1
besides , new studies suggest that breast milk may not be quite as superior as we ’ve been led to believe			0
women who breastfeed tend to be wealthier than women who do n’t , so the benefit to their children may come from other factors			1
for instance , women who breastfeed are less likely to smoke — so no wonder their babies suffer less from asthma			1
today , as i begin weaning my girls onto solids , i know their days of bottle milk will soon be over			0
but to discover that the greed of a few selfish @entity179 ‘ entrepreneurs ’ could put the lives of babies at risk is sickening			0
and it ’s certainly not the time for those on the breastfeeding bandwagon to make me feel as if i ’ve let my babies down .			0

@entity0 wanted to breastfeed but could n't keep up with demands from premature twins
she *'s* *shocked* mothers are called ' lazy ' and ' stupid ' for using formula
comments come as supermarkets ration sales of formula
