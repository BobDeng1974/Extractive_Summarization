a pre-med student in @entity1 is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line			1
@entity8 , a student at @entity9 , has launched a @entity11 campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line @entity13 , which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes , and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history			1
' the one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus , ' @entity8 told today			1
' it was one of the most devastating epidemics in the history of the world , but there on the page , colored with dyes , it just looked incredible , interesting and vibrant			2
using mirroring , @entity61 and kaleidoscope effects , each biological subject was turned into an eye - catching pattern that could be printed on fabric			2
the designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns , a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio , muscle cells and rabies			0
the patterns will also be available for printing on @entity80 cases after the company , which has already raised $ 13,798 , reaches its $ 15,000 crowdfunding goal			0
in her design work , @entity8 also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases , as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they have n't been vaccinated			1
the brains of the outfit : pre-med student @entity8 came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope giving ' cell phone ' a whole new meaning : @entity40 will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue , chicken pox and polio from the @entity107 to the yoga pant : @entity111 , s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured , will initially be priced at around $ 75 ' frankly , it 's unacceptable , ' @entity8 told today			1
' it 's not like we 're trying to solve an unsolvable problem			0
we really have the power to lead the way toward a healthier future			0
we already have the tools			0
' with this idea in mind , @entity8 is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio , rubella and hepatitis , as well as expanding medical care access around the globe			1
now , with an expanding team - and an exploding online following - @entity40 's goal of $ 15,000 has nearly been reached , meaning the line is just on the cusp of going into production			0
@entity40 : based on the strength of her idea , @entity8 has enlisted a new vp of retail , @entity138 ( third from right ) , and several friends as models for the project showing off their muscles : the @entity11 campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $ 15,000 the first group of designs lined up will be called ' she 's got it ' will have the theme of beauty in a woman 's body and will feature images of brain , nerve , heart and epithelial ( stomach )			1
aside from bringing awareness of preventable diseases to the forefront , the ' she 's got it ' line has its own unique purpose			0
' we hope women will wear these clothes and feel empowered to join the discussions of public health , science and technology that are so vital to our world , ' @entity8 explained			2
' our hope is that our stylish , feminine , fun , and most importantly , interesting designs will appeal to girls of all ages - and maybe encourage them to get involved in the scientific community			0
