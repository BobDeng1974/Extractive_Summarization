sea levels have risen by about 20cm over the past century by @entity1 @entity3 is warming almost twice as fast as previously believed , a new study shows , heightening fears of a catastrophic thaw that raise water levels from @entity7 to @entity8			1
annual average temperatures at the @entity12 research station there have risen @entity14 ( @entity15 ) since the @entity16 , it said , one of the fastest gains on the planet and three times the global average			1
@entity3 holds enough ice to raise world sea levels by at least 3.3m ( 11ft ) if it ever all melted			1
melting : a new study raises the alarm over rising sea levels due to climate change in the @entity28 heating up : on this map , the colour intensity indicates areas around @entity3 that are likely experiencing comparable warming to @entity12 , which is marked by the star that process would take centuries , but even a much more modest thaw could threaten low - lying areas and coastal cities across the planet			1
' continued summer warming in @entity3 could upset the surface mass balance of the ice sheet , so that the region could make an even bigger contribution to sea level rise than it already does , ' said @entity46 , professor of geography at @entity48 and senior research scientist at the @entity12 station			1
' even without generating significant mass loss directly , surface melting on the @entity52 could contribute to sea level indirectly , by weakening the @entity28 ice shelves that restrain the region 's natural ice flow into the ocean			1
' low - lying nations from @entity60 to @entity61 are especially vulnerable to sea level rise , as are coastal cities from @entity64 to @entity65			1
sea levels have risen by about 20cm ( 8in ) over the past century			1
the @entity68 panel of climate experts projects that sea levels will rise by between 18 and 59cm ( 7 - 24in ) this century , and by more if a thaw of @entity71 and @entity3 accelerates			1
@entity72 , pictured in 1960 : due to its location some 700 miles from the @entity74 and near the center of the @entity52 , @entity12 is an important indicator of climate change throughout the region @entity79 , study co-author and scientist at the @entity81 , said that the new findings place @entity3 among the fastest - warming regions on @entity84			1
the rise in temperatures in the remote region was comparable to that on the @entity89 to the north , which snakes up towards @entity91 , according to the @entity93 - based experts writing in the journal @entity95			2
parts of the northern hemisphere have also warmed at similarly fast rates			0
several ice shelves - thick ice floating on the ocean and linked to land - have collapsed around the @entity89 in recent years			2
once ice shelves break up , glaciers pent up behind them can slide faster into the sea , raising water levels			1
patchy data : since its establishment in 1957 , @entity12 has n't always been occupied and even after it was automated it has been subject to frequent power cuts , so scientists were forced to reconstruct readings ' we 've already seen enhanced surface melting contribute to the breakup of the @entity28 's @entity115 , where glaciers at the edge discharged massive sections of ice into the ocean that contributed to sea level rise , ' dr @entity79 said			1
' the stakes would be much higher if a similar event occurred to an ice shelf restraining one of the enormous @entity52 glaciers			2
' we could refreeze the @entity127 , and it would n't even cost that much , a scientist claims			0
two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the @entity135			2
the scientist who is lead author on both claims that ' any significant nation ' could find the resources to carry out the operation			0
the only significant question , he says , is whether we should			0
the amount of ice in the @entity144 shrank to an all time low in september ( see graphic above ) , with the total area covered now half what it was in the @entity149			2
@entity150 , professor of applied physics at @entity152 , is lead author on papers published in @entity154 and @entity155 which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice			2
he used climate models to suggest injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity84 , engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the @entity127			2
his paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea - ice around the @entity135 back to pre-industrial era levels			1
his second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified @entity173 jets , costing somewhere in the region of $ 8billion a year			0
however , while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the @entity84 's atmosphere , he does n't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest			0
researchers consider the @entity28 ice sheet especially sensitive to climate change , explained @entity48 doctoral student @entity185			1
since the base of the ice sheet rests below sea level , it is vulnerable to direct contact with warm ocean water			1
its melting currently contributes 0.3mm to sea level rise each year â € ” second to @entity71 , whose contribution to sea level rise has been estimated as high as 0.7mm per year			2
due to its location some 700 miles from the @entity74 and near the center of the @entity52 , @entity12 is an important indicator of climate change throughout the region			0
in the past , researchers have n't been able to make much use of the @entity12 measurements			0
@entity206 was often incomplete because nearly one third of the temperature observations were missing for the time period of the study			0
since its establishment in 1957 , the station has n't always been occupied			0
a year - round automated station was installed in 1980 , but it has experienced frequent power cuts , especially during the long polar night , when its solar panels ca n't recharge			0
professor @entity46 and two of his graduate students , along with colleagues from @entity81 and the @entity221 , corrected the past @entity12 temperature measurements and used corrected data from a computer atmospheric model and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations			0
aside from offering a more complete picture of warming in @entity3 , the study suggests that if this warming trend continues , melting will become more extensive in the region in the future , professor @entity46 said			0
while the researchers work to fully understand the cause of the summer warming at @entity12 , the next step is clear , he added			0
' @entity3 is one of the most rapidly changing regions on @entity84 , but it is also one of the least known , ' he said			0
' our study underscores the need for a reliable network of meteorological observations throughout @entity3 , so that we can know what is happeningâ € ” and whyâ € ” with more certainty			0

average temperatures have risen @entity251 since the @entity16 , study shows
west @entity28 ice sheet contains enough water to raise sea by 3.3m
sea levels have risen by about 20cm ( 8in ) over the past century
