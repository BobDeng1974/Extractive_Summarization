by @entity1 reporter published : 06:42 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 28 february 2013 frankly , they look like a reasonably ordinary pair of white trainers			2
but try telling that to @entity6 – or animal rights campaigners			2
for these shoes , commissioned by the singer , are made from no fewer than five different animal skins : stingray , anaconda , ostrich , crocodile and calf			1
fans and animal welfare groups alike condemned @entity6 , 31 , as ‘ cruel ’ and ‘ spoilt ’ for having the trainers made			1
beyonce zoo @entity19 electric : @entity6 wowed with her energetic @entity22 performance earlier this month a spokesman for animal charity @entity24 said : ‘ these custom - made kicks come with a high price – and it ’s paid by the various animals who were beaten and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed			1
’ he added : ‘ we hope that one day she ’ll go completely cruelty - free			0

‘ the less that is said about it the better , ’ he added			0
the cream colour shoes are a take on the wedge - style trainer , made popular by designer @entity41 , but given a so - called @entity44 makeover by @entity45 using a hybrid of land and sea skins			1
called @entity49 - @entity6 , the shoes , which have been given @entity6 's approval , are decorated with gold accents			1
the price is as yet undisclosed , but a regular pair sells in excess of £ 230 ( $ 350 ) so this embellished pair would sell for far more			0
@entity45 is a favourite brand of @entity6 and her a-list husband @entity59 - indeed , @entity59 had a shoe designed for him last year - the @entity61 - by the brand			1
his pair were as lavish as his wife 's , with an endless roll call of reptile skins used to make the shoe			2
high - fashion couple : @entity6 and husband @entity59 have now both had customized trainers created by @entity45 of the trainer they designed for @entity59 , @entity45 said : ‘ the @entity61 1 ′ s can not be tamed with an elaborate combination of elephant - print , ostrich , python , boa , crocodile , lizard , alligator , suede , and sting ray intricately cut to transform the @entity83 1 from a basketball sneaker into the world 's most daring and dapper sneaker concepts known to man			1
