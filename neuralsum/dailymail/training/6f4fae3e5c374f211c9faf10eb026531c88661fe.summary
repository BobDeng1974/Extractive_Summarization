by @entity0 published : 16:45 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 18 may 2012 @entity1 have suffered their first snub in the search for a new manager - and it has astonishingly come from @entity5			1
the @entity7 boss was one of the contenders to replace sacked @entity9 at @entity10 but he has decided to reject the opportunity to talk to owner @entity12			1
it is the first setback for @entity1 , who have approached at least four high - profile names , including former @entity17 boss @entity16			1
the last straw : @entity7 boss @entity5 ( right ) oversaw @entity7 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity1 in @entity9 's final match in charge @entity10 officials cast their net as wide as possible in their search to replace @entity9 by sounding out @entity16 and former @entity26 boss @entity25			1
they have also made formal moves to speak to @entity28 of @entity29 , and are considering @entity31 manager @entity30			1
a @entity7 statement read : ' @entity7 can confirm that an approach from @entity1 to speak to manager @entity5 was officially received by club chairman @entity34 this morning			1
' the club is pleased to confirm that @entity5 has declined the current opportunity to speak to the @entity10 club about the vacant position			1
' the @entity7 manager is currently working hard to strengthen the squad in readiness for the new @entity43 campaign			2
' wanted : @entity16 is free after leaving @entity17 top of the pile : @entity16 is hurled into the air after taking charge of his final game at the @entity48 @entity5 , 39 , signed a new three - and - half - year deal in february , made a huge impression by guiding @entity7 to an 11th - place finish in their maiden @entity43 campaign			1
the @entity54 club rounded off their season by beating @entity1 1 - 0 at the @entity56 , a fixture which proved to be @entity9 's last in charge of the @entity59			1
@entity7 's attractive possession style of play also won former @entity62 and @entity64 manager @entity5 plenty of admirers , and chairman @entity34 has admitted the @entity67 will have to become used to their boss being linked with other clubs			2
@entity5 is due to fly out to @entity71 this weekend as he gets the chance to spend four days with world and @entity75 champions @entity73 at their pre-euro 2012 training camp in @entity78 , before heading to @entity79 to take in @entity54 ' friendly with @entity80			2
on the shortlist : former @entity26 boss @entity25 has also been approached by @entity1 @entity29 chairman @entity82 confirmed he had given permission for @entity28 , the bookmakers ’ favourite to replace @entity9 , to speak to @entity1 ’s @entity87 owners @entity88			1
@entity89 understands the discussions were positive , to the point @entity28 is giving serious consideration to succeeding @entity93 rather than leaping into the highly - scrutinised role at @entity10			1
@entity1 have made it clear that @entity5 and @entity28 were not the only candidates on their list and they will not rush any decision			1
the owners are eager to gather as much information as possible before they fill the post and @entity12 will leave no stone unturned in his bid to find the best man for the job			1
@entity16 is available after deciding to take a year away from football after a remarkably successful spell at @entity17			1
man of the people : former @entity29 player @entity28 is idolised in @entity110 @entity111 , the @entity112 manager who almost succeeded @entity113 in 2010 , remains highly - regarded at @entity10 , while @entity115 ’s @entity114 and the @entity117 national coach @entity116 also have their admirers			1
former @entity120 boss @entity119 could also come into contention			2
the sense of farce at @entity10 deepened as the @entity87 owners managed to score another pr own goal over @entity126			1
days after sacking the long - serving director of communications @entity127 — clearly a casualty of the @entity126 debacle — an @entity87 journalist who has worked for @entity132 and @entity133 called @entity134 was appointed in the role			2
but on his @entity138 account on december 20 @entity136 responded to the news of @entity126 ’s eight - match ban by stating that @entity141 , the victim of the racist abuse , should have been charged by the @entity143 too			2
seismic proportions : repercussions from the @entity126 - @entity141 race row are still being felt @entity136 wrote : ‘ @entity126 decision aside , why is @entity141 not getting charged by @entity143 ? @entity141 admits in evidence he used insulting language towards @entity126			2
’ whichever manager takes over from @entity9 , the task facing them will be enormous and @entity1 managing director @entity153 has admitted the club have to make the biggest decision in their modern history			1
@entity153 expanded on the reasons for ending @entity9 ’s 16 - month reign and revealed that not even a win in the @entity161 final earlier this month against @entity120 would have been sufficient to save his job			0
@entity164 woe : not even an @entity161 victory would have kept @entity9 in charge @entity1 are seeking their fourth manager in less than two years and @entity153 said : ‘ it ’s absolutely critical we get it right and we move forward			1
it ’s where the club has to be			0
it ’s where everyone wants it to be			0
‘ when @entity177 ( @entity12 ) and @entity178 ( @entity179 ) arrived , they said they wanted to win			2
you can only live on history of success for a certain amount of time			0
i am under no illusion that we can find a top - class manager to come to this football club			0
’ on the decision to axe @entity9 , after he had won the @entity190 and taken @entity1 to within a whisker of following up in the @entity161 , @entity153 added : ‘ it was a very simple decision based on results and if we believed that was going to change			1
‘ we were 37 points off the winners ( @entity196 ) , 17 points off fourth ( place ) and had 14 losses			0
it was never about an individual result – and rightly so			0
it was always about taking a review of the stock of the season in full			0
’ @entity1 ’s continued absence from the @entity207 , coupled with their failure to challenge at the top of the @entity43 , has led to a dip in their global appeal			1
a recent survey revealed they are only the fourth most popular @entity213 club in @entity214			0
this , clearly , will be a defining summer and @entity153 knows steps need to prevent @entity1 becoming a relic			2
he said : ‘ that is why it is so critical			0
that is what everyone is working for			0
nobody is looking for average , mediocre progress			0
we are looking for progress that will get the club back where it needs to be			0
’ @entity9 ’s assistant @entity227 offered his resignation out of loyalty but it has not been accepted by the club			0
several players , including @entity126 , @entity232 and @entity233 , expressed their sorrow that @entity9 had left , but the most poignant tribute came from @entity236			0
the @entity1 skipper , who has just been appointed @entity26 captain , said : ‘ the last 24 hours have been a rollercoaster			2
@entity9 is my idol and always will be			0
’ @entity9 said on @entity138 on thursday night : ‘ overwhelmed by support of the fans			0
always been special but even more so now			0
thank you from the bottom of my heart			0
ynwa and i never have			0
