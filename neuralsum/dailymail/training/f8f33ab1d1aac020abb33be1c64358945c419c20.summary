@entity0 : fracking makes ¿ black stuff come out of the tap ¿ @entity7 agents are secretly working with environmental campaigners to halt fracking operations in the @entity10 and the rest of @entity12 , the head of @entity5 warned yesterday			1
@entity0 ’s government has ‘ engaged actively ’ with green groups and protesters in a sophisticated operation aimed at maintaining @entity12 ’s reliance on energy exports from @entity20 , said @entity5 secretary - general @entity13			1
he said the @entity7 had mounted a highly developed disinformation campaign to undermine attempts to exploit alternative energy sources such as shale gas			1
moves to start fracking in the @entity10 have been disrupted following a sustained campaign by environmentalists that has created fears about its impact			2
speaking at the @entity33 foreign affairs think - tank in @entity34 , mr @entity13 said : ‘ i have met allies who can report that @entity7 , as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations , engaged actively with so - called non-governmental organisations – environmental organisations working against shale gas – to maintain @entity12 dependence on imported @entity7 gas			1
’ he declined to give fuller details of the alleged plot , but said : ‘ that is my interpretation			2
’ he would not say what form the @entity7 ’ apparent engagement with the environmentalists took or whether groups concerned were aware that they were dealing with @entity20 ’s agents			1
according to mr @entity13 , who supports the experimental fracking operations , improving energy security is of the ‘ utmost importance ’ and requires @entity12 nations to develop more diverse sources of supply			1
‘ it also , in my opinion , involves the better functioning of the @entity12 energy market so that one single supplier is not able to blackmail one single nation , ’ he said			1
@entity10 has vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that may be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture the rock			0
scientists say we are sitting on deposits of enough shale gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years , mirroring the @entity76 oil boom of the 1970s			0
but shale gas development has not yet taken off here , unlike in countries such as the @entity80 where it has proved highly popular			0
opponents in the @entity10 have warned that the process risks causing earthquakes , polluting water , blighting the countryside and affecting house prices			0
plots : @entity5 secretary - general @entity13 said the @entity7 had mounted a highly developed disinformation campaign to undermine attempts to exploit alternative energy sources such as shale gas there have been fierce protests against the technique , with exploratory drilling near the village of @entity98 , @entity99 , abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators			1
mr @entity0 has repeatedly voiced concerns about fracking , once telling a global economic conference that ‘ black stuff comes out of the tap ’			1
and @entity7 ’s state - owned gas giant @entity107 , the world ’s biggest gas producer , says fracking has ‘ significant environmental risks ’ including water contamination			0
@entity113 has told opponents to embrace fracking as part of efforts to reduce dependence on @entity7 energy supplies			2
mr @entity13 ’s comments drew an angry response from @entity122 , which saw a group of activists threatened with up to 15 years in jail last year after they staged an anti-drilling protest on a @entity7 off - shore oil platform			0
a @entity122 spokesman said : ‘ the idea we ’re puppets of @entity0 is so preposterous that you have to wonder what they ’re smoking over at @entity134			2
‘ mr @entity13 should spend less time dreaming up conspiracy theories and more time on the facts			0
‘ @entity139 gas will probably cost more than @entity7 imports			0
there ’s little chance fracking will generate more than a small fraction of @entity12 ’s gas needs and it wo n’t even do that for at least ten years			2
’ @entity147 ’s head of campaigns , @entity149 , was equally dismissive			0
‘ perhaps the @entity7 are worried about our huge wind and solar potential , and have infiltrated the @entity154 , ’ he said .			0

@entity160 said plan was part of disinformation campaign
