@entity1 's thumping 4 - 2 derby victory over @entity2 is the latest vindication for the methods of manager @entity5			1
the @entity6 spent long periods of the season under fire for the disjointed performances of his misfiring team but is now basking in the glory of a dramatic upturn in fortunes			1
convincing victories over @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 have fans believing in @entity20 's fabled philosophy			1
with a place in the top four all but assured and local bragging rights restored , here are five things the manager changed to transform @entity1			2
@entity1 players celebrate @entity28 's goal during their 4 - 2 victory ove @entity2 here comes the @entity30 who is this marauding midfield menace ? @entity33 was public enemy no 1 last season , appearing to epitomise everything that was wrong with @entity1 under @entity36			1
the scapegoat with the funny hair found it no laughing matter and this season has thrived under a manager who is utilising his strengths			0
@entity20 is brave enough and bold enough to throw the big man into the action and give him licence to attack , regardless of aesthetics			2
if his unplayable form continues , expect sales of those daft wigs outside @entity52 to rocket			0
@entity33 celebrates after the influential @entity30 gave the @entity53 a 2 - 1 lead on sunday @entity33 leaps to meet @entity56 's cross with a header to send @entity52 into a state of euphoria last season , @entity33 struggled to make an impact at @entity52 and was heavily criticised by fans @entity64 - nother one comes good some @entity1 fans will tell you that they always knew @entity67 would do the business , he just needed the opportunity			1
@entity20 however , will say that the box - to - box @entity71 boy is now thriving because he has taken on board his advice			2
the manager bemoaned a lack of composure from @entity67 which saw him start just one @entity79 match from october to mid-february			1
since his return he has provided a cutting edge that @entity1 lacked until their spring rising			2
@entity20 will no doubt claim similar credit for the resurgence of a reborn @entity56			2
@entity84 midfielder @entity67 has been in impressive form for @entity5 's side the @entity1 boss congratulated @entity67 after another good performance as @entity1 defeated rivals @entity2 figuring out what 's the @entity91 @entity91 failed to live up to big expectations last season and looked like another who would prove to be a big - money flop			1
in fairness , it was a tall order to perform in a sinking side and some wondered if , given an apparent lack of pace , he would ever fit in			0
the man who arrived in a helicopter , however , finally has lift - off			0
surrounded by willing runners he is now a key cog in a well - oiled machine			0
loved by @entity109 fans , he is now close to being adored in @entity110			0
@entity91 slots the ball past goalkeeper @entity113 to give his side a commanding 3 - 1 lead against @entity2 @entity91 celebrates in front of the @entity1 supporters after firing his side into a two - goal lead reputation counts for nothing @entity20 has been dropping hints about his philosophy all season			1
the message came loud and clear when he was asked why he had preferred unproven teenager @entity126 to £ 280,000 - a - week loan man @entity127			0
' if a player cost £ 95m or £ 5,000 it ’s not any different for me , ’ @entity20 told us			0
‘ you have to prove yourself			0
’ it is that mantra that has seen the likes of @entity127 , £ 60m @entity135 and old pal @entity136 spend large parts of the season checking their backsides for splinters and has paved the way for the re-emergance of the likes of @entity91 , @entity67 , @entity33 and @entity56			1
@entity127 ( right ) has had to settle for a place on the bench after failing to impress @entity20 record £ 60million signing @entity135 has also been made to sit on the bench by the @entity1 boss stumbling across a system despite snatching unlikely victories , @entity1 had laboured for long chunks of the campaign with the atmosphere at @entity52 often flatter than a ( @entity154 ) pancake			1
the three at the back is long gone and while it might not be the 4 - 4 - 2 the frustrated fans chanted for at @entity159 , the 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ( with a special mention for @entity161 ) some would say the boss was forced into thanks to injury is not far off			0
by luck or design it is working			0
the @entity52 is rocking again and the nightmare of last season seems a million miles away			0
@entity161 has been key to @entity1 's recent form as his side move up the @entity79 table			1

@entity1 have won their last six @entity79 games
@entity5 has made several changes since the start of the season
@entity91 , @entity33 and @entity67 have all impressed
@entity135 and @entity127 have struggled to make an impact
