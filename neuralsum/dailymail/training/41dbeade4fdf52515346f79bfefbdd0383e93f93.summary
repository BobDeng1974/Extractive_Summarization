by @entity1 reporter published : 14:00 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 14:50 est , 24 july 2012 an overlooked bill for $ 140 nearly lead to a @entity4 plumber and his wife losing their home in a tax lien fight			1
@entity9 told @entity10 how he became one of a growing number of people whose property tax liens are sold to real estate investors who then demand missed payments plus interest from the homeowners			1
in the case of mr @entity9 and his wife @entity21 , the $ 140 charge and four years of interest payments coupled with lawyers fees added up to $ 50,000			1
contentious property : @entity9 and @entity26 live in this home in @entity28 , @entity4 and because they missed one $ 140 payment , they were at risk of losing it all together ' it was never brought to my attention until it was too late and we were served with papers saying we had to move out of our house , ' mr @entity34 told the news site			1
on the surface , the issue of the overdue bills does not seem surprising or new			0
however it is the numerous transitions of said overdue bill that come as a surprise			0
at risk : now @entity26 ( pictured ) and her husband have to pay nearly $ 50,000 in interest rates and backpayments as well as legal costs in the case of mr @entity9 , that is a surprise that nearly cost him his home			1
with a number of towns filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy - including three municipalities in @entity64 - city governments across the country are looking for ways to bring in some much - needed cash			0
one quick fix , that has potentially unintended consequences , is if the city government sells the rights to the unpaid tax liens on homes in their jurisdiction to investors who hope to recoup the amount due from the unpaid bill as well as the interest that they can collect during the elapsed time			1
' now you 're seeing more and more single - family homes pop up on the tax lien list			0
they 're owner - occupied homes with people who are having trouble keeping up with their tax payments , ' @entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity4 administrator who sold the @entity26 tax lien , told @entity10			1
while the profits on individual homes may not be enough for the towns to stave off bankruptcy completely , these moves have helped amass a surprisingly large financial band - aide			0
the @entity97 released a report saying that in 2010 , local governments collected a total of $ 15billion by selling off home tax liens			2
said liens are scooped up by a wide range of investors - like , in the case of the @entity108 home , a group called @entity109 - who turn around and charge the homeowners for their missed bill payments plus interest with rates that can go as high as up to 18 per cent			2
depressing trend : more local governments are selling off their liens on owned - homes to investors who then demand the missed payments plus exorbitant interest rates from the owners or else they sell the property that meant that mr @entity9 was hit with a bill for $ 37,500 from @entity109			2
they worked out a way for the bill to be paid in conjunction with their mortgage , but because of the pre-existing mortgage payments and the legal fees that came with the lien battle , the entire episode will end up costing the @entity26 ’ approximately $ 50,000			2
for families in similar situations , such agreements can not be reached and result in foreclosed homes			0
‘ i think he stuck me up without a gun , this guy			0
if he was a nice guy he could have said “ ok , i understand what happened , give me $ 5,000 for my troubles , ” but he wanted a lot of money , ’ mr @entity9 told @entity10 .			0

@entity4 couple missed a home payment of $ 140 four years *ago*
due to financial strain , their town sold the rights of that lien to investor
@entity158 charged them missed payment plus interest
