a 26 - year - old man decided there was more to life and gave up everything so he could travel the world in a converted van			1
bored with his conventional life in the @entity8 , systems engineer @entity6 , 26 , has spent 300 days travelling 10,000 miles in a £ 2,500 @entity10 van			1
the adventurer , from @entity12 , converted the vehicle into his very own ' studio apartment ' complete with bedroom - lounge - diner , walk in shower room , 200 - watt solar power system , fridge and gas cooker			1
he worked in an office during the day while learning to build websites and researching how to refit his van in his evenings			0
@entity6 explained how he reached the decision to make such a dramatic change in lifestyle			2
' i lived in @entity12 and i really love that city , ' he said			2
' i have loads of great friends in @entity42 and i had my own place which rented with a friend , a car and a good job			0
mr @entity6 now takes in some of the more spectacular views around the world as he tours with his van this is the scene that mr @entity6 was more used to on a daily basis ; @entity12 ' looking back though , i was quite miserable the year before travelling			1
i felt a bit trapped , and i had a feeling of - is this it ? this ca n't be it			2
' i wanted something different - adventure , experience and challenge			0
i was bored , and living on the road was a daydream i could n't get rid of			0
' i was lucky everyone there was really cool when i told them my plans to leave the @entity8 and travel the world in my truck			0
' i was nervous , scared , excited and relieved because i knew there was no going back			0
it 's a bit of a life experiment			2
' mr @entity6 paid £ 2,500 for the @entity10 van , and spent a fair amount of time making it into his ' home ' there is space in the back of the van now to dine , relax and then sleep , with a nice wood finish mr @entity6 has added in extra storage space for some of life 's essentials as he travels around the world @entity6 , who left the @entity8 in march last year and is currently in the paradise @entity86 island of @entity87 , managed to scrape together £ 4,500 to finance his new life			1
he now survives on a daily budget of just ten - pounds per day by diesel sharing with hitchhikers , generating money from his online blog and juggling fire as a street performer			0
highlights of @entity6 's journey include crossing the incredible @entity99 pass in @entity100 , taking part in @entity104 's @entity103 music festival and spotting brown bears in the forest			1
' in @entity108 , i did a three - point turn in a narrow mountain road and the back wheels slipped off the edge of the crumbling road			0
this is how mr @entity6 's home started - more akin to a painter and decorator 's pack - up than a home mr @entity6 spent four months preparing the van for the next journey of his life ' my foot was pressing so hard on the brake , there was fluid leaking onto the road , i could n't let go because i 'd go off the road down the hill , backwards			1
' my van is rear wheel drive so i had to be towed out			0
' i really did n't think i 'd get out of that situation			0
' so far @entity6 has travelled from @entity42 to @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , then he travelled east to @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity104 , @entity100 , @entity140 to eventually reach @entity86			1
@entity6 has travelled from @entity42 to @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , then he travelled east to @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity104 among others mr @entity6 has ensured he can dine with a little bit of style , despite eating out of the back of a £ 2,500 van there was even enough room to fit a toilet into the van , and right , a general view from the back despite the drama of life on the road , @entity6 explained why he has no firm plans to return home at the moment			1
' i like @entity42 , but the winter and lack of light kills me - plus it 's too cold to live in a van during winter , ' he said			1
' i want to look back when i 'm older and think - yes i was living , and i made the most i could out of life			2
mr @entity6 has said he has no firm plans to return home at the moment after taking in some wonderful sights @entity6 ( back row second from left ) celebrates in a pub with friends before his world trip ' i describe everything in my blog and whether this gives people a kick in the right direction to follow their dreams , or helps them in some way with van conversions or travel then i 'm happy			1
' eventually , i want my website to be a resource for anyone who wants to convert a van into their home with minimal skills and tools , as well as guides for living and travelling in a van			2
' this is a great way to travel and live			0
