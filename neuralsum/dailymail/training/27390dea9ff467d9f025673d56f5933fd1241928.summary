by @entity0 last updated at 9:35 pm on 26th december 2011 @entity3 's response to the nuclear crisis that followed a violent tsunami was utterly confused , a report claimed today			2
bumbling government employees and relief workers made a catalogue of errors during the disaster at the @entity13 nuclear power plant , the 500 - page document concluded			1
it said authorities had grossly underestimated tsunami risks , assuming the highest wave would be six metres ( 20 feet ) , when they in fact hit more than double those levels			1
disastrous mistakes : government employees have been fiercely criticised by a report for being unprepared and disorganised ahead of the @entity13 nuclear power plant explosion workers at @entity28 , which ran @entity13 , were untrained to handle emergencies such as the power shutdown that struck when the tsunami destroyed backup generators , it said			1
all these mistakes contributed to the world 's worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 on march 11 , said the damning report			1
the report , which is set to be completed by 2012 , attacked the @entity28 for the mistaken assumption an emergency cooling system was working and a delay in disclosing dangerous radiation leaks			0
it criticised the authorities for further delays in publicising the dangers and describing the situation using the word ' soteigai ' , meaning ' outside our imagination ' , which it said implied they were shirking responsibility for what had happened			1
national tragedy : the report painted a disturbing picture of the errors made by workers at @entity28 and by government officials life - threatening issues : authorities underestimated the tsunami risks and wrongly assumed a cooling system was working ' this accident has taught us an important lesson on how we must be ready for soteigai , ' it added			1
it said that by labelling the events as beyond what could have been expected , officials had invited public distrust			0
there was no clear manual to follow , and the workers failed to communicate , not only with the government but also among themselves , it said			0
finding alternative ways to bring sorely needed water to the reactors was delayed for hours because of the mishandling of an emergency cooling system , the report said			0
workers assumed the system was working , despite several warning signs it had failed and was sending the nuclear core into meltdown			2
the report acknowledged that even if the system had kicked in properly , the tsunami damage might have been so great meltdowns would have happened anyway			2
but a better response might have reduced the core damage , radiation leaks and the hydrogen explosions that followed at two reactors and sent plumes of radiation into the air , according to the report			0
more worrying still was how the government delayed in sharing vital information with the public and used evasive language to avoid admitting serious meltdowns at the reactors , the report said			0
dangerous delays : officials were too slow in revealing the extent of the radiation leaks during the world 's worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 , said the report the government did not release radiation data fast enough in the area , the report found , unnecessarily exposing towns to radiation when they could have evacuated			1
the government has norecommended changes so utilities will respond properly to serious accidents			0
it recommended separating the nuclear regulators from the unit that promotes atomic energy , echoing frequent criticism since the disaster			0
@entity3 's nuclear regulators were in the same ministry that promotes the industry , but they are being moved to the environment ministry next year to ensure more independence			0
the report did not advocate a move away from nuclear power but recommended adding more knowledgeable experts , including those who would have been able to assess tsunami risks , and laying out an adequate response plan to what it called ' a severe accident '			1
the report acknowledged people were still living in fear of radiation spewed into the air and water , as well as radiation in the food they eat			0
thousands have been forced to evacuate and have suffered monetary damage from radiation contamination , it said , and the earthquake and tsunami left 20,000 people dead or missing			1
' the nuclear disaster is far from over , ' the report said .			2

catalogue of errors includes ' underestimating tsunami risks ' and ' delays in revealing extent of radiation '
workers were ' untrained to handle such emergencies '
claims authorities tried to shirk responsibility for what happened
worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 left 20,000 dead or missing
