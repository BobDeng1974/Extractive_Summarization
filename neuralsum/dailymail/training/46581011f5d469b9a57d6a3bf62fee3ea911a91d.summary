by @entity0 a new watch - like gadget can measure uv exposure and tells users when they are about to get burnt , without them missing out on all - important vitamin @entity5 the gadget was created to negate the need for suncream , which protects skin from harmful effects of the sun 's rays but also stops the skin from absorbing @entity14 rays used to make vitamin d. experts fear such creams have caused a worldwide deficiency			1
using the gadget begins by inputting an estimated skin sensitivity , on a scale of 1 to 11			0
the led lights lining the watch then illuminate as uv exposure increases			2
when it is time to get out of the sun , the led lights begin to flash			0
@entity40 , who co-founded the company producing the gadget said : ' @entity5 deficiency is pandemic around the world			2
the watch uses a small sensor and measures sun sensitivity from 1 - 11 , before using the led dials to tell you what level of uv ray you have soaked up the watch is intended as a way to cut down on the use of suncream , which can potentially lessen the amount of vital vitamin d we absorb ' there are huge numbers of people who are aware the sun is healthy , but do n't know how much they need			1
' uvb gives you vitamin d and @entity20 tends to give you more sun damage			2
' @entity5 is important for managing the body 's calcium levels and maintaining healthy bones , and has also recently been thought to have an effect on breast cancer , arthritis and diabetes			1
@entity74 who researches vitamin d at @entity76 , said : ' this is an interesting gizmo and provided that the calibration is reasonably accurate , for both the @entity14 and for the sensitivity to sunlight , it could be a useful safeguard against sunburn			0
' the watch does have its shortcomings though , as it only technically measures sunlight on the wrists , and not the entire body however , she was frank about its possible shortcomings , saying : ' worn on the wrist , it only tells you about sunlight on that wrist and not how much vitamin d one might make during exposure , since the rest of the arms could be covered up			1
' the latest version is on sale for $ 50 , but is expected to be upgraded with a new version which will have @entity102 capability linking to a smart phone app. the team that produced the original is also working on a sensor that will be able to differentiate between @entity20 and @entity14 rays			0
other uv tracking bands are due to be released later this year , such as @entity110 june , a uv sensor disguised as jewellery .			0

uv watch measures sun exposure and alerts users to possible sunburn
makers hope it will negate the need for suncream
suncream has been known to cause drop in vitamin d production
@entity5 is important for bone *density* *&* calcium *uptake*
