by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 24 may 2013 a lawyer for @entity2 today claimed that his prosecution for drink driving was illegal – because the actor was ‘ not completely sober ’ when he was told about it			1
during bizarre proceedings in a @entity10 criminal court , defence barrister @entity7 admitted the @entity12 actor had been drinking champagne before he fell off his moped in the city last november			1
but by the time he was questioned by detectives and then charged he was still too drunk to understand what was going on			2
mr @entity19 ’s claims were denied by @entity10 police who said in a statement that @entity2 was ‘ conscious , lucid and able to respond ’ when he was charged			2
bizarre excuse : @entity2 claims that his prosecution for drink - driving on his moped ( file picture ) was illegal because the actor was ' not completely sober ' when he was told about it @entity2 meanwhile failed to turn up in court today because he was away filming a thriller with @entity30 in a country notorious for its human rights abuses			1
despite all this , prosecutors called for @entity2 to be banned from driving for 10 months and to be fined the equivalent of £ 3,400			0
the 64 - year - old @entity38 movie star ’s case had been postponed three times because he kept staying away			2
he was accused of driving his moped through @entity10 while more than three times over the drink - drive alcohol limit			0
no show : the actor , seen here in @entity45 earlier this month , did n't appear at court today because he is filming ‘ he ’s very busy in @entity50 , ’ said mr @entity19 , referring to the capital of @entity48 , where @entity2 and @entity49 are working			1
mr @entity19 said @entity2 ' asked me to represent him in court where he wants to be judged , as he always said			0
' star : @entity2 is currently filming a thriller with @entity30 ( above ) in @entity48 mr @entity19 also said he wanted to get @entity2 ’s case struck out because correct procedures where allegedly ignored when police measured the amount of alcohol in his bloodstream			1
but judges went ahead with the case and , after hearing evidence , deferred judgement until june 21st			0
@entity2 , the star of some 150 films including @entity68 and @entity69 , and @entity49 are making a movie called @entity71 in @entity48 , a country with a notorious human rights record which is run by the controversial @entity73			2
@entity73 , a close friend of @entity2 , has been implicated in numerous crimes including torture and extra-judicial killings , but denies any wrong doing			0
miss @entity30 said she was initially told that the film would be shot in @entity78 , and ‘ had to take a very deep breath ’ when she was informed that filming would also take place in @entity48			1
miss @entity30 has claimed she has not met @entity73 , but the leader has in turn posted pictures on social media showing him accompanying the actress and @entity2 around @entity50			0
