by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 3 december 2012 the first stealth drone developed in @entity2 has made its first flight from a test base in @entity5			2
the ' neuron ' drone has been built by researchers in @entity5 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , and has been in development for five years			0
today , the first flight was able to take off from @entity18 company 's base in @entity19 , @entity5			0
it is powered by a @entity34 ' @entity33 ' engine , and will carry precision missiles controlled remotely by a human operator			1
the craft will act as a testbed for new technologies , and is unlikely to be produced in its current form , acting instead as a prototype			1
the large craft is 10 meters long , has a wingspan of about 12.5 meters and weighs five tons without weapons			2
it is powered by a @entity34 ' @entity33 ' engine , and will carry precision missiles controlled remotely by a human operator			1
' today , the @entity48 , @entity2 ’s unmanned combat air vehicle ( @entity50 ) stealth technology demonstrator , successfully completed its maiden flight from the @entity18 company ’s flight test base in @entity19 , in collaboration with the flight test personnel of the @entity5 defense procurement agency ( @entity57 ) , ' said @entity18			0
' the @entity48 will continue to undergo testing in @entity5 until 2014 , at which time it will be sent to @entity60 in @entity12 for a series of operational trials			0
' it will then go to the @entity64 range ( @entity10 ) for further tests , in particular firing and stealth measurements			0
' engineers working on the plane before its first flight : the craft is far more advanced that current @entity73 drones the futuristic craft being unveiled ahead of its first flight			1

*10m* long craft could eventually fire precision missiles controlled by a remote operator
craft is *believed* to be far more advanced than current @entity73 drone technology
