are @entity1 the future of the bedtime story ? when a child scans them , one of 47 different stories plays on screen , from @entity21 to @entity22			2
the stories are written in text and narrated out loud , but children can read along on their own			0
not surprisingly , this @entity27 innovation has upset parenting groups , with one online commenter saying : ' what ’s next , an app that potty trains ? ' read to your children and create memories that will last a lifetime			1
' are the days of snuggling up with a book at bedtime over ?			0
