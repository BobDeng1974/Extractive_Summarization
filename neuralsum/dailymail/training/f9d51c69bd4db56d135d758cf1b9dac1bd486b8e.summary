by @entity0 the trade advantages of being in the @entity3 single market are ‘ imaginary ’ and have not helped @entity5 exports , according to a new report			1
it claims the @entity5 ’s exports to @entity9 have grown at a slower rate than our trade with other leading countries outside the @entity3 bloc , over the past four decades			1
and the proportion of @entity3 trade within @entity5 ’s total exports of goods and services abroad , is no higher than when @entity5 joined the @entity20 in 1973 , at just over 60pc			1
@entity5 ¿ s exports to @entity9 have grown at a slower rate than our trade with other leading countries outside the @entity3 bloc , over the past four decades meanwhile , it points out that @entity5 ’s trade with countries outside the @entity3 – such @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 – has increased enormously over the same period			1
the report from the centre - right think tank @entity35 , using trade figures from the @entity34 , suggests fears about losing and jobs and growth if @entity5 leaves the @entity3 may be misplaced			1
when campaigning ahead of the last referendum on membership in 1975 , then prime minister @entity40 told the public that it was ‘ the world ’s most powerful trading bloc ’			0
but the author @entity46 , a former academic at the @entity47 and now director of an @entity50 market research firm , said new figures made clear the single market had ‘ changed nothing ’			0
in first study of its kind , he showed exports of @entity5 goods to the 14 nations who were members before 2004 have not increased as a proportion of trade with all @entity34 nations			2
@entity3 countries accounted for 63.9pc of exports when @entity5 joined the common market in 1973			1
despite highs of up to 70pc in the late 1980s and in 2004 , it slowly fell to 61.9pc by 2012			0
the authors say @entity5 goods exported to @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 more than doubled over this period from 5.1pc to 10.7pc			0
services exported to them trebled from 6.1pc to 20.2pc , a list of countries which were the fastest growing exports to the initial members of the @entity3 over the past 20 years found rapidly - growing @entity77 in first place , followed by @entity79 and @entity80			2
the report authors say @entity5 goods exported to @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 more than doubled over this period from 5.1pc to 10.7pc ( library image ) @entity5 was in 28th place , just below @entity85			2
the value of @entity5 exports to @entity9 countries is way behind those from @entity90 , @entity91 and even the @entity92 which was behind @entity5 until 2011			1
mr @entity46 rules out the argument that @entity5 producers have not adapted to the opportunities offered by the single market			0
he found the fastest growing markets for @entity5 good and services are mostly outside the @entity3 , with @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity99 and @entity100			2
they are all ahead of the initial 14 @entity3 countries			0
the report from the centre - right think tank @entity35 suggests fears about losing and jobs if @entity5 leaves the @entity3 may be misplaced ( library image ) ‘ over the 40 years of @entity3 membership , for all the costs and obligations incurred , for all the treaties negotiated , and for all the immense amounts of time and anguish spent arguing about various aspects of the @entity3 project , the proportion of @entity5 exports going to the @entity5 ’s future @entity3 partners has changed hardly at all ’ , he said			1
‘ while the share of @entity5 exports to fellow @entity3 members has been virtually stable , the share going to non-members in @entity9 has risen steadily , leading one to suspect that both insider advantages and outsider disadvantages are imaginary			1
’ the study also cast doubt on @entity131 claims that @entity5 had more clout to negotiate trade agreements as part of the @entity3			2
there were 25 @entity3 free - trade agreements in force in 2012 while @entity31 had independently negotiated 26 , the report said			0
in a ‘ balance of competences ’ review ordered by the government , and published in february , most businesses said they felt @entity3 rules were ‘ beneficial to the national interest ’			0
however they said there were concerns about how it exercises its power and the costs of membership			0
mr @entity46 claimed this was ‘ empty rhetoric ’ if the @entity154 did not consider the @entity5 ’s experience in the single market over a long period or its performance in other markets .			0

exports to @entity9 grown at slower rate than with other leading countries
trade with countries outside @entity3 increased over same period , report says
fears about loss of jobs if @entity5 left @entity3 , are false @entity35 report suggests
