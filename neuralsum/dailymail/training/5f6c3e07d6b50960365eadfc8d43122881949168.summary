by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 continues to have his future as @entity5 manager questioned but he has found an ally in former @entity5 and @entity8 striker sir @entity7			1
with fans calling for @entity2 's head towards the end of last season after perceived drab performances and negative tactics , co-owners @entity9 and @entity11 opted against replacing the 59 - year - old over the summer			1
since then it has been a challenging pre-season for @entity2 and the club - starting when record signing @entity21 returned home from a tour of @entity25 for an operation on an ankle injury which has ruled him out for up to four months			1
under pressure : some @entity5 fans have turned on @entity2 before the season has even started in charge : owners @entity11 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) decided to keep @entity2 for this season loanee @entity34 also suffered a hamstring injury on his debut , @entity33 has been charged with assault on his ex-girlfriend and her mother and @entity9 has come out with quotes which have undermined @entity2 's position			1
@entity43 side @entity42 have now accused @entity5 of underhand transfer tactics in a move for @entity46 , with a threat of further action against the club lingering			2
many fans remain convinced @entity2 is not the man to lead the club forward to their @entity53 move in two years but @entity7 believes the @entity5 have the perfect manager in place as @entity2 heads into his fourth season in charge at @entity58			1
' i 'm very much in the camp of wanting to keep @entity2 , ' the @entity8 @entity60 winner told @entity63			2
injury worries : @entity21 is out for four months as he requires an operation on his ankle key man : @entity21 looked impressive when fit last year but @entity5 will miss his goals ' we need to improve the team , there 's no doubt about that			1
he has n't got a great side but the way i see it if he can keep us mid-table then that 's a fantastic job			0
' it 's crazy that there 's pressure on @entity2 before the season has started but that 's football			1
' they have n't had a particularly good pre-season but that does n't necessarily mean anything			0
down the years at @entity5 , we have had good results after not doing well in pre-season and we 've had poor years after making a good start so it does n't mean a lot			2
' a narrow 3 - 2 victory over @entity93 on saturday was @entity5 's only win inside 90 minutes during a pre-season which took in a tour of @entity25			1
also out : @entity34 picked up an injury on his @entity5 debut during a difficult @entity5 pre-season all in all it has been a pre-season to forget , with @entity7 aware that the loss of @entity21 will be a hard obstacle to overcome			1
' they 've had a bit of a blow with @entity21 getting injured , ' he said			0
' they missed him badly last year and i think some of the struggles were down to the fact that the guy did n't play			0
' when he got fit towards the end of the season we picked up some good results and got ourselves out of trouble			0
' @entity117 's @entity60 star @entity116 and former @entity119 forward @entity118 have been brought in to provide competition in attack , whilst @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 have also signed for the @entity5			2
those additions have excited @entity7 , who said : ' i 'm very much for the continuity of keeping him there			0
it makes sense to me			0
stick with it : @entity7 ( right ) says that his former club should keep @entity2 in charge at @entity58 ' he 's made a couple of signings so we need to see how they fit in and they 're still in the market for another striker to replace @entity21			1
' that hunt for a new forward has seen the @entity5 linked with the likes of @entity144 and @entity145 - whilst a bid for @entity148 's @entity147 was rejected			2
@entity46 looked destined to move to east @entity149 but the 24 - year - old who fired the @entity43 side to the @entity154 title last season will now stay put			0
@entity42 accused @entity5 of altering their offer at the last minute having allowed @entity46 to undergo a medical with the @entity159 side and will assess their options in response to the breakdown of the deal			0
fallen through : @entity42 have prevented @entity46 from moving to @entity5 and complained about @entity2 ' the @entity168 club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal , which does not correspond to @entity42 's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs , ' a statement on their official website read			1
' @entity42 regret this clear lack of respect , which is unacceptable , from @entity5 towards @entity42 and also the player			0
' as a result , @entity42 reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defend their interests			0
' @entity42 had released @entity46 from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the @entity185 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in @entity8 to complete the last stage of the deal			0

hammers won only once in 90 minutes during pre-season tour
@entity21 and @entity34 both picked up injury
owner @entity9 has undermined @entity2 's position
but @entity7 thinks @entity2 can lead @entity5 to acceptable mid-table finish
