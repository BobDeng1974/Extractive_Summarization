by @entity0 a woman and a dog recently had the good fortune to find each other at a @entity6 animal shelter , not only because they both needed companions , but also because they 're both deaf			1
@entity8 had been looking for a pet that shared her condition and employees at the @entity12 wanted the pit bull mix they 'd fallen in love with to find the same thing			1
when @entity18 and @entity8 met this month , everyone was a winner			1
but it took some time for shelter employees to figure out just what they were dealing with in the 3 - year - old rescue			0
@entity8 and @entity18 both happen to be deaf and both wanted an understanding friend now @entity18 is going home with what shelter workers is the perfect family			1
' it 's what i hoped would eventually happen and it , she could n't have gone to a nicer family , ' @entity37 of the @entity38 told @entity44			0
@entity8 was experiencing some of those same feelings as she came to take @entity18 home			2
' i 'm going to teach her my sign language , how deaf people communicate , she 's a smart dog , she can pick up fast , ' said @entity50 as she sat with her family , @entity18 's head in her lap. @entity50 said she 'd always wanted a deaf dog and jumped at the chance to adopt @entity18 when she heard she 'd spent three months at the @entity55 , @entity6 shelter and needed a home			2
mystery soon solved : 3 - year - old @entity18 did not respond to workers when she first arrived to the @entity12 , but they soon understood why ' it was just amazing to watch ' : staff of the @entity12 taught @entity18 some signs and say it quickly helped her come out of her shell the emotional day , which was bittersweet for shelter workers who 'd grown to love @entity18 , @entity50 and @entity37 even hugged and vowed to stay in touch before the pooch drove away as the newest member of the @entity51			1
months earlier , @entity18 was in a more precarious position			2
she was around people who cared when she arrived at the shelter , but they could n't figure out why she would n't respond to them			0
as soon as they ascertained the cause , @entity37 and company started teaching @entity18 simple signs , armed only with treats and a guide to @entity77			0
' it was just amazing to watch her just blossom into a dog , i do n't think she knew how to be a dog , ' @entity37 said			0
touching : @entity50 plans to teach the dog some of her own signs so the two of them can communicate in a way they each best understands			0

@entity8 had the good fortune of finding @entity18 , a pit bull mix , at the @entity12 this month
@entity18 learned some signs in the three months she was in the shelter
