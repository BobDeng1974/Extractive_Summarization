in an essay penned for @entity9 , @entity0 said she ' felt compassion for these young women			1
' ' like so many others , i feel outrage — as a fellow victim , as a civilized individual , and as a woman — when other women are so easily and publicly violated			2
and i have found myself wondering : have we become a world of pathetic voyeurs ? are we turning into scruffy old men in dirty raincoats slouched in the back row at the @entity28 theater ? ' she wrote			0
citing her phone conversations taped by @entity36 that later aired on tv , @entity0 wrote her experience was different from those of the recently - hacked a-listers , but that ' the searing embarrassment and stinging humiliation are still there			1
' @entity0 wrote that ' ... certainly we can agree that stolen private nudes of actresses ( or of anyone , really ) is crossing the double yellow line			2
' ' when you can see hacked , private nude photos , we have crossed a line , ' @entity0 later wrote in her @entity9 essay			1
' and we ’ve been saying this for years , in other contexts , for other transgressions			0
