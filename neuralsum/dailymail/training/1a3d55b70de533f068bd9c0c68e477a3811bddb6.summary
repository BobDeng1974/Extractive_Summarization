by @entity0 with nine bedrooms , six bathrooms and a perfect view of @entity5 , it ca n't have been a bad place to hide from the plague			1
now the mansion @entity9 called home in 1665 after fleeing disease - ridden @entity11 is on the open market for the first time in its 600 - year history - and if you have £ 5million lying around , it could be yours			1
grade i listed @entity17 is in @entity18 in @entity5 , @entity19 , one of the most exclusive @entity22 streets outside @entity11 whose residents have included former prime minister @entity24			1
rumour had it @entity27 would address the people of @entity5 from the safety of the projecting oriel window , while the great composer @entity31 gave his first @entity33 performance in the mansion 's music room			1
the house was bought by the @entity38 family , a wealthy dynasty of politicians and diplomats , in 1660 and kept in their ownership for more than 300 years			0
over the centuries they shaped the way it looks today - including commissioning an extension by sir @entity48 , who designed @entity49			0
the current owners , @entity51 and @entity52 , bought the home in 2006 from the wife of @entity56 mp @entity55 , who had passed away two years earlier			2
@entity57 , from @entity58 , said : ' owing to its rarity and historical connections , we expect strong interest			0
' princely : @entity17 , which @entity9 called home for about a year in 1665 after fleeing plague - ridden @entity11 , is on the open market for the first time in its 600 - year history - and could be yours for £ 5 million			1
the main house , spread across 7,638 sq ft , has a reception hall , drawing room , study and library country pile : the home was built in 1416 and , during the @entity76 , was the home of sir @entity78 , the high sheriff of @entity19 who lived there while raising an army to support @entity81 in 1660 it was taken on by the wealthy @entity38 family , which shaped it into the house it is today including an extension by sir @entity48 repairs : the current owners , @entity51 and @entity52 , bought @entity17 in 2006 from the wife of @entity56 mp @entity55 , who had passed away two years earlier			1
at the time it had a leaking roof and several rooms were unlived in so @entity92 stepped in to help pay for the extensive restoration history : it was in the mansion 's music room that legendary composer @entity31 , a friend of the owner @entity38 , is thought to have made his first @entity33 performance safe from plague : the oriel window ( left ) where @entity9 ( right ) addressed his subjects as he hid from the plague that was sweeping uncontrollably across @entity11			1
the next year , in 1666 , the plague would be largely decimated by the @entity107 which , although it destroyed much of the city 's history , claimed very few lives @entity57 , from @entity58 , said : ' @entity111 is one of the most desirable places to live in outside @entity11			1
it is an urban setting , but it is the best of both worlds			0
it is country and town in one setting			2
i have sold a number of homes in the close , but the architectural quality of @entity17 's interior is exceptional ' escape to the country : @entity9 fled @entity11 to escape the plague when @entity9 fled to the house in 1665 , he was only doing what thousands of poverty - stricken @entity128 would have loved to do			1
the capital 's slums were never free of the disease , but a hot summer in 1665 coupled with a sharp boost in population saw residents leaving more and more rubbish out in the streets			0
huge red blotches on the skin - perhaps better known as a ' ring - a - ring of roses ' - would be the first sign of a fatal condition which spread like wildfire among the cramped conditions of the city 's poor			0
by coincidence , wildfire was exactly what did spread the next september when a bakery in the ancient timber - built @entity145 caught alight , sparking the @entity107 which raged for days			0
catastrophic though it was , it helped wipe out the plague			0
by the time it broke out @entity9 had already returned to @entity11 from @entity5 in february 1666			1
after things were made safe , he travelled to address the 100,000 made homeless and declared the fire had been an act of @entity158			1
it was not the first time @entity9 avoided disaster raging all around him			2
he escaped @entity33 during the @entity76 in 1651 and remained in exile until the monarchy was restored almost a decade later			2
in one incident during the @entity167 , he and a colonel managed to evade angry parliamentarians by hiding all day inside a hollow oak tree at @entity170			0
it was since renamed the @entity172 - as are countless pubs			0
domestic bliss : the kitchen is big enough to whip up a @entity177 - era banquet			0
the house 's price - tag is down to its location , size , architecture and history dream job for a gardener : the grounds , while not as large as in some country piles due to its urban location are still enough to play a good game of football ... or croquet			0
@entity31 was a friend of @entity193 and the house is named after @entity38 , who became the 1st @entity195 in recognition of his diplomatic career			2

grade i listed @entity17 in @entity5 , @entity19 , was built in 1416 and has never been sold on the open market
@entity9 lived there in 1665 after fleeing @entity11 to escape the plague and would address town from his window

home has an asking price of £ 5million and includes nine bedrooms , six bathrooms , reception hall , study and library
