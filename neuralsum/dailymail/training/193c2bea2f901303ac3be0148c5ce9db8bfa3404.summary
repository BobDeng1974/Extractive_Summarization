by @entity0 published : 16:42 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 03:19 est , 17 may 2012 illegal : based in @entity3 , @entity2 is the world 's largest @entity4 site an illegal file - sharing website has been taken off line after a cyber attack by a mystery hacker			1
the @entity2 , which enables people to download files , music and films without paying , was suddenly bombarded with internet traffic which overwhelmed its servers			1
the so - called @entity16 ( @entity16 ) attack left the site largely inaccessible for the last 24 hours , with only intermittent service in the @entity19			1
the @entity2 took to its @entity21 page to confirm the attack , saying that it did not know who was behind it , although it ‘ had its suspicions ’			1
a number of powerful industries have already called for the site to be blocked , but it is unlikely online anarchic hacking group @entity28 were behind the onslaught			1
‘ there will be further attacks , but what 's significant about this whole story is that people think that it is the @entity28 attacking a site which is typically a type of site that they defend , ’ said @entity31 of @entity32 told the @entity43			2
‘ it could be the record labels , or a government somewhere that has had enough of not being able to catch @entity2 , it could be just one person who had rented some cloud power from @entity49 and is sitting in a cafe , and is able to launch an attack			1
’ ’ if they 're losing money and seeing that the government is not being able to stop it , there 's a real monetary value reason for them to try and bring it down , ’ mr @entity31 added			2
in november the @entity19 , which represents music producer , called for @entity2 to be blocked convicted : @entity60 , left , and @entity61 have both been sentenced to jail and a £ 2.4m fine for running @entity2 pirate bay defendant @entity63 speaking at a demonstration in 2006			1
he has been sentenced to one year in jail for breaking @entity68 laws the @entity2 , launched in 2003 by a group of friends from @entity3 , allows users to search for and access copyrighted content including movies , games and tv shows			1
in 2009 , the @entity3 courts found the site 's four founders guilty of helping people circumvent copyright controls			1
the ruling was upheld after an appeal in 2010 but the site continues to function			2
a message on @entity2 's blog said the move was an attempt by the music business to ' squeeze ' it out of the market			1
it advised users to ' circumvent the block ' and campaign against the move			2
the message said : ' write to your @entity93 and tell them to appeal the case			0
write to your local mps and tell them that this is not allowed			0
make sure your voice is heard			0
' remember , we ’re all the pirate bay , and we must stand united against the censorship from our opponents			0
' the @entity104 @entity19 , a spin - off from the political movement started in @entity3 that backs copyright reform , said the latest move will ' not put any extra pennies into the pockets of artists '			1
' unfortunately , the move to order blocking on @entity2 comes as no surprise , ' party leader @entity112 said			2
enemies : the @entity2 has seen powerful industries align against it by calling on internet service providers to block the site ' the truth is that we are on a slippery slope towards internet censorship here in the @entity124			1
' the director of @entity126 , @entity127 , said web - blocking was ' a crude tool ' and would not stop ' determined users '			0
he said : ' the broader consequences risk damaging legitimate businesses and undermining cyber-security while further perpetuating the myth that this is an easy technological solution to a complex problem			0
' ultimately , the risk is that @entity93 will be expected to monitor everything their customers do online to ensure they are not doing something they should not be			0
indeed , it is almost inevitable certain groups will call for this when web blocking is exposed as the ineffective and easily - avoided instrument it is			0
' as the calls for greater surveillance of our online activity intensify , the long - term risk is that the state will take on the function of deciding what we are allowed to see online			0
' @entity155 , executive director of the @entity156 , said : ' blocking @entity2 is pointless and dangerous			2
it will fuel calls for further , wider and even more drastic calls for internet censorship of many kinds , from pornography to extremism			0
' internet censorship is growing in scope and becoming easier			0
yet it never has the effect desired			0
it simply turns criminals into heroes			0
