@entity0 says @entity1 need a clear - out this summer			1
the head coach is in danger of missing out on a permanent appointment following a string of desperate displays by his team , who were accused by @entity11 pundit @entity10 of having their flip - flops on			1
@entity0 hit back at that on friday but fired his own warning to those who have performed so poorly			1
and with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 out of contract in the summer , plenty of players will come under threat			2
@entity0 says there needs to be a clear - out at @entity1 in the summer @entity19 ( left ) is one of many players whose contracts expire at the end of the season ‘ they know there has to be a clear - out , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s pretty obvious , to the man in the street and to the professionals — it has to be done			0
‘ there are people out of contract , people who are not good enough — they know that			2
’ @entity0 ’s words are his strongest since taking over from @entity42 in january			2
the @entity43 held a dressing - room inquest in the wake of last sunday ’s 3 - 0 surrender at @entity47 and the boss admits everyone — himself included — is fighting for his future at the club			1
‘ we all are , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s why i was a bit astonished when people ( @entity10 ) came out and talked about us being on the beach and wearing flip - flops			1
how can players do that when they know that everybody is playing for their futures ? ’ @entity0 ’s situation has not been helped by the lack of player investment in the january window which has left him with just 13 senior players ahead of today ’s visit of @entity70			1
the @entity1 players applaud the fans after the disappointing defeat by @entity47 last weekend right - back @entity74 will deputise for suspended skipper @entity76 at centre - back , despite admitting earlier in the week that he ’d never played there			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i think he ’s a great professional and he will deal with it			2
he understands the game , he is a full international			0
it ’s another string to his bow and i think he ’ll cope with it			0
‘ he ’s been great around the place			0
he ’s such a character			0
he ’s larger than life and he ’s quite funny , but he ’s a good professional with it			2
‘ when we lost @entity90 ( to @entity70 ) it was a blow but we replaced him with a better all - round player			1
‘ but i must admit i ’ve never been in a position like this ( with injuries and suspension ) and i do n’t think anybody i ’ve ever worked with has , either			0
‘ i ’m missing my best players and that ’s how i look at it			0
with @entity102 it ’ s like @entity100 being without @entity101			0
with @entity104 , it ’s like them being without @entity106			0
‘ it ’s tough , but we ’re not going to use that as an excuse and throw in the towel			0
