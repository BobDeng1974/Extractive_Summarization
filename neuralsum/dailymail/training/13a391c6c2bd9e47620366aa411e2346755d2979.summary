@entity1 defender @entity0 is not getting carried away with top six thoughts despite another well - earned point for the impressive @entity5 side			1
the @entity6 survived the second - half dismissal of @entity8 to hang on for a goalless draw at @entity10 and further underline their presence at the top end of the @entity13			1
overall , @entity15 's side lacked their usual fluency in a drab affair at @entity18 but they moderated their ambition after @entity8 's red card 18 minutes from time to ensure they avoided defeat			1
@entity1 had to play with ten men after @entity8 was shown a red card but held on to get a point it said much for their defensive discipline under former centre - back @entity15 , who has attempted to add resilience to the free - flowing style that has become well established at the @entity31			1
but any idea that the @entity6 can maintain the momentum and push for a place in @entity35 is something left - back @entity0 is not ready to consider			1
the @entity39 international said : ' we are not thinking about anything like that			1
it 's week by week			2
' we have got a couple of massive games now against @entity46 and @entity47 and they are games where if we can get clean sheets it would be brilliant			2
' but we are not getting ahead of ourselves			0
there are games this season we should have gone on to win and games like saturday where we have nicked points away from home at good places			0
@entity0 says @entity1 are not thinking about @entity59 football , despite their place in the top six @entity62 fires wide as @entity1 pushed for a win , but in the end they had to hold out for a draw ' it is a crazy league and you have to take it week by week			1
i think teams are going to jump up a few places or drop down a few places every week			0
top six ? i do n't know , but we will keep striving to do well			0
' there were few chances at @entity18 but @entity1 had reason to feel aggrieved when @entity10 defender @entity79 - who later went off with a serious shoulder injury - appeared to stretch out a hand to stop a @entity8 shot in the first half			1
@entity8 protested but referee @entity80 gave nothing and the former @entity84 midfielder 's frustration might have contributed to his needless first booking soon after			2
@entity8 kicked the ball away after conceding a foul and that was something that he would later regret when he was sent off after 72 minutes for impeding @entity90			0
@entity15 's side have become defensively more resilient this season , while continuing their good football @entity0 , 25 , said : ' first half we were under the cosh and had to defend really well			1
second half we came out and for the first 20 minutes we were perhaps the better team			0
we could have got a goal in that spell and were starting to think we could maybe win the game , but then the sending - off changed the game and you look then to get the point			2
' we did that and we have got to be happy with a point			2
they are a really offensive team and they commit men forward with a lot of attacking talent			2
if you keep a clean sheet at @entity18 you have got to be happy			0
' the @entity10 did apply late pressure but were unable to make it count			1
they might have snatched victory with what would have been the final touch of the game as @entity120 delivered a dangerous ball but @entity122 could not make contact in front of goal			0
@entity79 , who suffered a serious injury , was lucky not to concede a penalty at @entity18 the main positive for @entity129 's men was that the result at least extended their unbeaten @entity13 run to four games			1
goalkeeper @entity133 said : ' i think we 're all frustrated			0
it was a nothing game			0
there were n't many chances at either end			0
' it was disappointing for us because we like to score lots of goals but we kept a clean sheet , which is a positive and a draw at home keeps us going			0
@entity133 shows frustration as @entity10 failed to score against ten men , in what he called a ' nothing game ' ' we are playing well			1
we are in the middle of a pretty good run			0
of course we would have liked to have won but we have got two other big games this week and this keeps us ticking over , and keeps us unbeaten in a few games			0
' @entity10 host @entity156 in the @entity157 on thursday and travel to @entity159 next sunday .			1

@entity1 held out for a point against @entity10 with 10 men
@entity164 takes @entity15 's side into sixth place
but defender *insists* they are not thinking about @entity59 *qualification*
