by @entity0 published : 15:00 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 18:01 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 's most active volcano @entity3 has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the @entity6 countryside			1
the two - day explosion last weekend was the third major burst of activity in under a month , after eruptions on october 26 and again on november 10 - 11 , with the latter burying a seismic station and the access road			0
the latest outburst sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the @entity19 island last night			1
it was at its height between midnight and 5am on sunday morning			0
the breathtaking footage shows the volatile volcano emitting streams of hot lava from the earth 's core			2
mr @entity34 said : ' @entity3 had started a series of violent eruptions from the same crater in february 2013 until april , then was relatively quiet throughout the summer until october , when another paroxysm occurred			2
' everyone then thought there would be a second one relatively shortly after , but it took about two weeks to occur			0
' now , we 're waiting for the next one			0
the general feeling and opinion is that something big is going to happen soon			0
' contrast : one thick , orange block of smoke coated half the night sky , as the moon set and the sun rose , casting morning light across the mountains colourful : photographer and geologist @entity34 stayed up through the night to capture the contrasting colours as molten lava burst out into indigo skies outburst : the eruption lasted two days and sent streaks of lava kilometres into the air			1
residents of @entity26 woke to see a mist of orange smoke bathing the sky endless : the night came and went , but @entity3 was still bubbling and bursting , transforming the surrounding land into black and white craters of ash there have been more than 40 paroxysmal eruptions since january 2011 , always at the @entity92 crater , which formed during this period and has now become a grown - up summit cone in just two years			1
the november eruptions also changed the volcano 's vent geometry , causing it to produce a series of perfect steam rings - a rare phenomenon			2
' i saw a perfect steam ring racing over the sky , something i had last seen at @entity3 back in 2000 , when it had a phase of several months to produce frequent rings			2
late night activity : this is a shot around midnight , when the lights in the town below are still on			0
people in @entity26 could see the explosion but escaped harm the volcano , in @entity6 , @entity19 , has been relatively quiet over the summer months , but erupted into life on october 26 , with a further eruption following on november 10 - 11 escaped danger : despite spitting lava for two days , civilians in @entity26 were not endangered			2
however , staff at @entity122 closed the airspace			0
breathtaking : the images look like paintings as long , think lines of bright orange lava stream across the landscape towards the slopes below ' i shouted at my girlfriend @entity131 to look and grab her camera and started to take some pictures myself			2
the steam puffs shot out from the weather cloud as small mushrooms and many of them " gave birth " - i have no better way to describe it - to rings			0
' the most amazing was to see their rotation , how they detached from the plume , and how stable they were despite the storm - force wind up there			0
' they lasted several minutes , perhaps up to 10 , becoming smaller and smaller with distance , but always stood out as a clear sign in the sky			0
some penetrated even other clouds at distance			0
' breathtaking : @entity3 , @entity2 's most active volcano , spews molten lava thousand of feet above the @entity6 countryside during its latest eruption fiery sight : a group of men engage in conversation , seemingly unaware that the volatile volcano is emitting streams of hot lava from the earth 's core explosive : the eruption was captured on camera from @entity169 , near @entity170			1
it is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year powerful : the eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the @entity19 island last night - forcing airport officials to close airspace over @entity3 the explosion - which is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain			1
however , staff at @entity184 have been forced to close airspace above @entity3 , which is the largest and most active volcano in @entity2			1
this is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft , as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass			0
this would ultimately cause the planes ' engines to shut down			0
incredible : the explosion - which lit up the @entity6 sky - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain @entity3 's last major eruption was in 1992 - causing a fast - flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain			1
despite the town of @entity206 being endangered by the streams of the red - hot liquid , successful diversion efforts saved the town and only one building was destroyed			0
however , the fiery volcano , currently standing at 10,925 feet tall , is still in constant activity			1
astonishingly , it is steadily growing , and has been for 500,000 years , when eruptions began			2
its latest eruption was preceded by a violent tremour on monday , which sent hundreds of perfect smoke rings into the air			1
risk : however , staff at @entity184 have been forced to close airspace above @entity3 , which is the largest and most active volcano in @entity2 danger : this is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft , as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass			1
this would ultimately cause the planes ' engines to shut down no signs of stopping : the fiery volcano is still in constant activity			0
it is situated on the geological boundary where the @entity2 and @entity241 plates collide experts believe the eruption may have sparked a change in the structure of a vent , perhaps into a particularly circular shape - allowing @entity3 to spew the unusual smoke - like formations			1
the volcano , which came into existence almost one million years ago , has been well - documented since @entity251 , when its eruptions forced civilians to migrate for safety			1
since then , there have been more than 200 eruptions - from the almost undetectable to the catastrophic			0
in 122 @entity258 , an explosive eruption spewed so much ash onto the town of @entity26 - crushing hundreds of houses - that the town 's inhabitants were exempted from paying taxes to @entity265 for ten years			2
horrific : @entity3 's last major eruption was in 1992 , pictured , causing a fast - flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain the most powerful eruption to date was in 1669 , when the explosions destroyed part of the summit and the lava flows reached the sea more than ten miles away			1
this disaster prompted town leaders to attempt to control the flows of lava - to no avail			0
an extremely violent eruption in 1852 produced more than 2 billion cubic feet of lava and covered more than three square miles of the volcano 's base , while the longest eruption began in 1979 and went on for thirteen years			1
near - miss : the town of @entity206 was endangered by the streams of the red - hot liquid ; however , successful diversion efforts saved the town from much damage @entity3 's current activity consists of continuous summit degassing , explosive @entity295 eruptions , and frequent basaltic lava flows			1
it has proved a constant concern for @entity6 - with more than 25 per cent of the island 's population living on @entity3 's slopes			1
the volatile volcano is also the main source of income for the island due to a combination of agriculture - stemming from its rich volcanic soil - and tourism .			0

@entity3 's latest eruption was caught on camera from @entity169 , near @entity170 , by @entity35 geologist @entity34
the third outburst in a month , it spewed molten lava into the air and sent plumes of smoke and ash over the island
@entity2 's most active volcano , almost one million years old , currently stands at 10,925 feet tall and is still growing
