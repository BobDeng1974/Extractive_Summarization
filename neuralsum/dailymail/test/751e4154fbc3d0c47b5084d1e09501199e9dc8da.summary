@entity0 has warned @entity1 that putting @entity2 on a bumper new contract could cause a ripple effect across the rest of the @entity8 squad			1
the @entity10 manager feels paying @entity2 more than the £ 100,000 - per - week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20 - year - old 's team - mates demanding more			1
yet @entity0 does not blame @entity2 , currently on £ 35,000 a week at @entity8 , for trying to get as much as possible			1
@entity0 feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available			2
@entity8 and @entity18 star @entity2 has stalled over signing a new contract at the @entity21 club @entity0 believes that giving @entity2 a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other @entity8 players @entity8 boss @entity1 ( right ) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club 's best players ' when the supply is far less than the demand , then you 've got very big demands from the youngster , who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about , ' @entity0 said			1
' not just in the country but in @entity35 in general , if not in the world			2
' the demand is out there			0
a lot less than we want it to be			0
hence that gives it a value			0
when that comes around it 's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand			2
' it reflects down the way from there on in , by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that			0
' @entity0 feels if a club were to buy the @entity18 international , who currently has two years left on his contract at @entity8 , then they would not only be getting a player , but a brand			1
' if a player is in his position like @entity2 , then you 're going to look at his value , ' @entity0 added			1
' not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding			0
' you have to remember that we 're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend			0
the agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club , and the value of that to him and their brand , and they ask for that sort of money			0
' @entity2 drags the ball back ahead of the oncoming challenge from @entity90 's @entity89 ( left ) @entity2 scored his first goal for @entity18 during the 4 - 0 win in the @entity94 qualifier against @entity90 @entity0 was speaking ahead of @entity10 's match with the @entity97 's bottom - club @entity96 on saturday			1
the game will see @entity0 reunited with @entity96 manager @entity99 after they worked together at @entity101 in 2007			1
@entity99 has been involved in several controversial incidents this season , including grabbing @entity105 's @entity104 by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference			2
it added to speculation @entity99 will be sacked but @entity0 defended the man that was once a coach under him at @entity114			1
' @entity99 was there ( at @entity101 ) when i arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time , ' @entity0 said			1
' i always thought he was management material and i think he left just after i left , then moved into management and has been very successful			0
' i suppose in the end @entity99 is a very , very , very , very honest man			2
he says it how it is			0
perhaps that 's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly , but he knows who he is			0
he knows what he wants			0
he knows how to try to achieve it			0
