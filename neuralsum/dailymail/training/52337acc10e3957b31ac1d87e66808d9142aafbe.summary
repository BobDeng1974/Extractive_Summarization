by @entity0 recycling targets blamed for the death of the weekly bin round are being routinely ignored across @entity5 , a major study shows			2
while @entity7 is on course to meet the controversial goal of recycling half of all household waste by 2020 , many other countries are barely out of the starting blocks			1
successive governments have placed restrictions on household waste in a bid to meet @entity18 targets originally imposed more than 20 years ago , which say countries should recycle half of their rubbish by 2020			2
these are widely blamed for the scrapping of weekly bin rounds for millions of families			0
yet other countries appear to have simply ignored the targets and are still dumping almost all of their waste in landfill sites			1
@entity32 , for example , does so for 99 per cent of its rubbish compared to just over a third in the @entity7			1
the new study by the @entity18 ’s statistical agency @entity36 shows that the @entity7 ’s efforts have been effective , raising recycling rates to 46 per cent			1
' they 're the same bunch he gave me last year ' this is above the @entity45 average and is a huge increase from the 10 per cent recorded at the turn of the century			2
but the report also reveals that recycling remains a novelty in many parts of @entity5			0
@entity32 is the worst offender , recycling just one per cent of its household @entity53 , the @entity18 ’s newest member , recycles just 16 per cent of its waste , sending the rest to landfill			1
but slow progress is not confined to @entity5			0
@entity61 recycles just 13 per cent , while @entity62 achieves only 18 per cent			1
even @entity63 lags way behind the @entity7 , recycling 39 per cent of its waste			1
the figures will raise fresh concerns that the @entity7 has been too quick to embrace inconvenient @entity18 measures that other @entity45 nations appear to be able to ignore with impunity			1
@entity71 mp @entity70 said : ‘ we , as a self - governing country , should be free to decide how much we recycle and in what way			0
the figures from elsewhere in @entity5 are also instructive about how we deal with these things			0
‘ every time we sign up to new regulations we create a rod for our own back because we have an army of officials to enforce them to the last comma			0
’ the @entity83 defended the targets , saying increased recycling ‘ protects the environment and human health and creates jobs and growth ’			0
recycling policy is governed by a number of @entity18 directives dating back more than 20 years			0
the most important is the @entity93 which states countries must recycle a minimum of 50 per cent of household waste by 2020			1
refuse : the targets are widely blamed for the scrapping of weekly bin rounds for millions of families a @entity83 spokesman said the @entity7 ’s record was ‘ about average ’ compared to other long - standing @entity18 members			2
he insisted that the worst offenders could even be fined if they did not up their game			0
but @entity108 ’ @entity107 director @entity106 said : ‘ @entity110 targets become even more useless when no - one else holds up their end of the bargain			0

while @entity7 toes the line , many other countries simply use landfills
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity32 all lag behind @entity7 *'s* 46 per cent
