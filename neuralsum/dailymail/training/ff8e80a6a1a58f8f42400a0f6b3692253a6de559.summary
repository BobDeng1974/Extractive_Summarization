by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 14 august 2013 a biplane of the @entity4 @entity3 and a @entity6 fighter hurtle towards each other in the midst of the @entity10 battle for the skies , crashing in flames , the pilots miraculously escaping to safety amid the smoke and the blaze ... these spectacular photographs have become famous as some of the most dramatic records of the war in the air , and are expected to fetch a princely sum at auction in @entity23 today			1
yet they 're all completely bogus			0
@entity25 : the photographs appear to show @entity4 and @entity28 warplanes mid-combat that has n't stopped @entity31 's photographs from becoming coveted by collectors - partly for their bizarre history			1
the photos first came to public notice in the 1930s , when one ' @entity37 ' , who claimed to be the widow of a @entity4 air ace , went to a publisher with a trove of photos her husband had reportedly taken with a camera mounted on his plane			0
mrs @entity37 claimed the pilot had set up the shutter to be triggered with a machine gun			0
the publisher at the time was understandably wowed by the incredible shots - so much so that he paid $ 20,000 for the work			0
the pictures then became the basis for a book , @entity56 : the @entity57 , which was published in 1933			1
@entity31 claimed it was the journal of an anonymous @entity61 pilot killed in combat			2
incredible : the pilot appears to eject to safety from the @entity28 fighter plane true story : the pictures formed the basis of a book of @entity72 's experiences , even though they had been set up with miniature planes on wires the photos caused a sensation , appearing in newspapers and gallery exhibitions			1
to begin with , no one seemed to notice that the clear , high - speed images were well beyond the capabilities of cameras and film available at the time			2
nor did the fact that @entity4 aeroplanes were smack in the middle of several frames - meaning the pilot would have been firing on his mates - raise any initial eyebrows			0
the ' widow ' quickly disappeared from public view once she had cashed in on the images			0
but it was n’t until 1984 that the images were definitely declared fakes , after the effects of @entity31 - a former @entity98 pilot and early movie special effects man - were donated to the @entity101 in @entity102 the trove included a number of photos similar to the @entity107 images — but before @entity31 had airbrushed out the wires holding up the miniature planes			1
@entity31 , according to @entity110 , had fallen on hard times during the @entity112			2
he created the aerial tableaux , using his skills in visual trickery , then had his wife pose as mrs. @entity117 to sell them			0
the money they made from the fake shots was enough to tide the couple over until @entity31 could find a more suitable outlet for his talents in the film industry			1
bidding starts today at @entity128 for a collection of 34 of the images .			2
