@entity0 – the ‘ @entity0 ’ being hunted in the wake of the @entity7 mall massacre – is secretly married to a former officer in the @entity2 , a confidential @entity4 file on her reveals			1
the dossier throws new light on the shadowy world of the mother of four who converted to @entity12 as a schoolgirl and is now the world ’s most wanted woman			1
as well as being the suspected mastermind behind the westgate mall attack , which killed 67 people and left 71 missing and 200 injured , she is sought for earlier plots in her role as a major player in @entity25 ’s @entity24 offshoot , @entity23			0
new union : @entity0 , pictured in a selfie from a personal computer found by police at the house she was renting in @entity32 , is married to a @entity34 former @entity2 officer @entity35 convert @entity0 , 29 , widow of 7/7 suicide bomber @entity36 , left @entity37 for @entity38 with her children in 2009 and has been on the run for 20 months			1
but a @entity42 investigation can reveal that her current husband – a man named @entity45 who in his 40s – has been free to travel as he wishes , and is currently in continental @entity47			1
@entity45 was arrested in 2011 when police discovered that his house in the coastal city of @entity32 had been turned into a potential bomb factory by @entity0 and her associates			1
he was never charged with any offence			0
exactly how much he knew of his wife ’s clandestine activities is not clear but detectives now believe he could hold the key to unlocking her network of terror			0
it is not known exactly when their marriage took place , but @entity0 had evidently left her old life in @entity37 behind by then and was deeply involved with @entity23			1
a grainy image taken from @entity0 's computer shows a man holding a baby , believed to be her youngest daughter @entity69 , which could be the child 's father police say @entity45 is likely to have a better knowledge of @entity0 ’s travels and contacts and , most of all , her possible current whereabouts than anyone			1
his relationship with @entity0 has baffled detectives , given his military background and because he once worked as a private security officer in @entity82 , guarding westerners against attack from the @entity85			1
previously he has been described as @entity0 ’s ‘ landlord ’ at one of two houses where she stayed in @entity32 until she came to police attention in january 2012			1
but the dossier leaves no room for doubt that @entity0 is or was ‘ married to ’ @entity45 , making his freedom to travel at will all the more surprising			1
it is believed he has another @entity35 wife in @entity32			0
@entity0 ’s two elder children , nine - year - old @entity97 and @entity98 , eight , both by @entity100 , have the middle names @entity102 and @entity103 , respectively , which means ‘ martyr ’ in the male and female form , according to the police data			1
it is not clear who fathered her two younger children , four - year - old @entity111 and @entity69 , three , though it is believed that at one stage @entity0 was in a relationship with another @entity37 @entity23 recruit , @entity116 - born @entity115 , 28			1
he is thought to have been killed earlier this month in @entity24 following a gunfight with a rival group			0
the police file , codenamed @entity122 , includes an ‘ association chart ’			1
at its centre are @entity0 and @entity37 terror suspect @entity126 , 30 , from @entity127 , @entity128			1
he is a @entity35 convert who knew @entity0 ’s husband @entity100 , and is currently on trial in @entity32 on explosives charges			1
there are extensive details of all the mobile phone numbers linked with @entity0 , along with calls she has made to a woman , described in a police file as her ‘ aunt ’ , at an address in @entity141 , @entity142			1
last week the woman , who recently married , was on holiday and could not be contacted			1
exactly what her relationship is to @entity147 - born @entity0 , the daughter of a @entity149 mother and a @entity37 soldier , is unclear , but there is no suggestion she had anything to do with her activities			2
the police document suggests that @entity0 may have called the ‘ aunt ’ from @entity34 as many as 42 times – the last four in november 2011 and january 2012 , shortly before she went on the run			1
all the calls went to voicemail			0
the @entity4 file was compiled in the days following @entity0 ’s narrow escape from police in 2011 , a story that can now be revealed fully for the first time			2
the first arrest in the chain of events came in december 2011 when @entity126 was detained with another man at the @entity32 house owned by @entity171 , a few miles from the house @entity0 was living in			2
at @entity126 ’s place , police found ingredients needed to make a bomb – hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate , as well as batteries and electrical switches			0
a @entity34 @entity182 source told @entity42 that after being held in a cell without food for three days , @entity126 finally talked			0
he told the officers that they should be talking to his ‘ boss ’ – a white woman – and supplied addresses , including the property where @entity0 was staying			1
sharing the other house with @entity0 was @entity190 , 27 , the widow of @entity192 , an @entity25 agent killed in @entity193 in 2011			2
yet when officers raided the house , @entity0 convinced them that she was a @entity38 named @entity196			2
she had a bogus passport , obtained by using another woman ’s birth certificate			0
@entity201 mum : an image of @entity0 , who has named two of her children for the @entity207 word for ' martyr ' , seen with a baby , believed to be her youngest child a bag of money with thousands of pounds worth of assorted foreign currencies was also found at the house , but even that was n’t suspicious enough to persuade the police to bring her in			2
instead , they took a copy of the passport and left			0
when they updated @entity4 , one of the @entity128 detectives realised that the woman posing as @entity223 was @entity0			1
the @entity34 returned to the house the next day , but she had gone			0
before her escape she had tried to destroy her laptop by smashing it , but a few days later a @entity182 unit was able to retrieve vital data from it			0
among photographs on the laptop was one of her holding a baby			0
it is believed to show her youngest child @entity69 , born in july 2010			0
in another photograph an unidentified man – possibly the father – is seen holding the baby			0
also found was an exercise book in which @entity0 had begun writing a book , based on interviews with fellow ‘ mujahideen ’			1
she related how she had asked her elder children what they wanted to be when they grew up and both answered ‘ holy warriors ’			1
further investigations showed that @entity0 had entered @entity34 from @entity249 on february 26 , 2011 , and that in 2010 and 2011 she had spent several months in @entity250 working as an it specialist at a halal meat factory , posing as @entity223			2
the real @entity223 is a nurse who emigrated from @entity38 to @entity253			0
the last recorded use of the false passport was in february 2011 , before it was cancelled – the month that @entity0 entered @entity34			2
l @entity0 ’s mother , @entity257 , is desperate to see her grandchildren , her extended family have said			2
her plea came through @entity36 ’s mother , @entity260 , who told @entity42 yesterday : ‘ i have not heard from [ @entity0 ] since 2009			1
i spoke to her mother via email and she said she had not heard from her either			0
‘ her mother is very upset and she wants to see her grandchildren			0
’ speaking from her home in @entity266 , mrs @entity260 added : ‘ @entity0 was married to my son			1
she tried to help keep me in contact with my grandchildren but we would only speak briefly over the phone			0
‘ she appeared to become stranger after his funeral			0
now i have no idea where they are			0
’ she added : ‘ these people in @entity34 who carried out this criminal behaviour will get their punishment and they should , because criminal behaviour is not @entity12 behaviour			2
’ online war : @entity0 , pictured in her school year book , taunted her rival on @entity284 a chilling set of tweets believed to be by ‘ @entity0 ’ @entity0 show her taunting a rival before he was ambushed and murdered in cold blood			1
the messages then show her gloating over the rival ’s death , saying : ‘ ca n’t say i ’m shedding tears ’ and accepting ‘ what has been dished out to him ’			2
@entity35 convert @entity0 is believed to have been involved in the @entity7 terror attacks			2
she has been on the run since january 2012 when she was accused of a bomb plot targeting tourist resorts in @entity32 , @entity34			0
her @entity284 feed , @entity301 , shows her allegiance to @entity303 , the new leader of the @entity24 terrorist group @entity23 , which ordered the @entity7 atrocity			0
@entity303 – who has a £ 4.5 million @entity307 bounty on his head – was recently accused of killing rivals within his own group to assert his authority			0
one was a terrorist called @entity313 , also known as @entity314			0
@entity314 and @entity0 had a @entity284 spat in april , in which he dismissed her for ‘ just being a girl in @entity34 ’			1
@entity0 responded : ‘ yes , am a girl in @entity34 like dat [ that ] makes a difference u misogynist			1
’ she then called @entity314 an ‘ irritating , obnoxious , contemptible little muj prat ’			2
‘ @entity325 ’ is short for mujahideen ( jihadi warrior )			2
@entity0 continued her spat with @entity314 , which came to a deadly end when he was ambushed in southern @entity24 last month and killed			0
afterwards , @entity0 tweeted : ‘ i ’m waiting in anticipation of information on @entity331			1
