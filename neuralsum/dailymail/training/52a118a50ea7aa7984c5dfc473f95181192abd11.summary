by @entity1 reporter published : 22:17 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 00:05 est , 28 september 2012 just when you thought he 'd damaged his campaign all he could , @entity6 candidate @entity5 has been ruffling feathers once more by bad - mouthing sen. @entity8 on thursday			1
things seemed to be looking up for the embattled congressman , with a conservative fundraising group backing him with $ 290,000 , despite his controversial ' legitimate rape ' claims			1
but then he went and added fuel to the fire , accusing @entity8 of behaving in an unladylike manner			2
@entity8 was less ' ladylike ' in a debate last week than six years ago , @entity5 claimed @entity5 contrasted @entity8 's demeanor in their first debate last week with her approach six years ago			1
' she was very aggressive in the debate , which was quite different than the way she was when she ran against @entity27 ' in 2006 , @entity5 said during a campaign stop at the state capitol			1
at that time , he added , ' she had a confidence and was very much more sort of ladylike and all			0
' @entity5 's comment came moments after the @entity34 announced it was endorsing him			0
it was the highest - profile financial commitment @entity5 has netted since his campaign lost millions of dollars of planned advertising by other national groups that aid @entity39			1
those groups withdrew their support after @entity5 remarked last month that women 's bodies have ways of averting pregnancy in cases of ' legitimate rape '			1
@entity5 has apologized repeatedly since then but defied demands from top @entity49 - including presidential nominee @entity50 - to quit the race			1
he 's hoping his campaign can gain momentum now that he has let pass tuesday 's final deadline to drop out of the race			2
but staying in the contest has left @entity50 , running mate @entity57 and the rest of the @entity49 hierarchy in an awkward position			0
putting on a show ? @entity63 candidates for @entity64 @entity5 and senator @entity8 shake hands before a debate the ' ladylike ' comment complicated @entity5 's efforts and the broader contest for control of the @entity6			1
@entity39 need to gain four seats to win the majority , a task that seemed within reach a few months ago but has now grown uncertain , in part because of @entity5 's campaign			1
at the @entity76 on thursday , @entity5 said he believes he will get the votes of @entity39 and @entity50 supporters and defeat @entity8 , who has close ties to president @entity80			1
@entity5 said thinks @entity8 believes he can win , too			1
he cited as evidence @entity8 's demeanor in a @entity64 @entity84 debate september 21 , contrasting it with the way she debated then - sen. @entity27 in 2006			1
' in the debate we had friday , she came out swinging , and i think that 's because she was threatened , ' @entity5 said			0
@entity8 's campaign did not immediately comment about the remark , but others quickly denounced it , including @entity95 sen. @entity94 , chairwoman of the @entity96 , who called it ' demeaning to women and offensive to all '			1
@entity100 , which backs @entity96 candidates who support abortion rights , quickly incorporated the remark into an email fundraising plea to finance more tv ads against @entity5			2
' ladylike ? ! this is a @entity6 race , not a beauty pageant , @entity110 , ' the group 's new media director @entity106 said in the email			0
the @entity34 said it endorsed @entity5 because he is the @entity49 nominee , the race against @entity8 remains competitive and @entity64 is important to @entity49 efforts to gain the four seats necessary to win control of the @entity6			1
the organization said its members had pledged $ 290,000 toward @entity5 's campaign , and it hopes to get $ 100,000 to @entity5 by sunday , which is the cutoff for the quarterly financial reporting period			2
one @entity49 still supporting @entity5 is former presidential candidate @entity121 , who raised money for him in suburban @entity123 on monday @entity5 said he was thankful and ' very enthusiastic ' about winning the group 's support			0
' i think it 's logical - i am a conservative , they 're conservatives , i think it 's a common - sense type of thing , ' @entity5 said			0
the fund has gained prominence in recent years with the aid of sen. @entity134 , @entity135 , a favorite among tea party activists			0
among other things , the @entity34 supports a ban on congressional spending earmarks , which use legislation to direct particular amounts of money to specific entities in a particular state or congressional district			0
@entity5 has used earmarks in the past to direct funding to such things as highway projects and military armor , although he and @entity154 , the executive director of the @entity34 , both have said @entity5 supports the group 's ban on earmarks			0
@entity5 said thursday that he 's against amendments that are slipped into bills at the last moment that direct money to specific projects , particularly if joint @entity163 and @entity6 conference committees add items that were n't in versions that originally passed the chambers			2
but he added : ' do n't take the definition ( of earmark ) so broadly that the members of @entity170 do n't have any input into the budget process			0
' the aid from the @entity34 follows @entity5 's endorsement wednesday by @entity134 and former @entity49 presidential candidate @entity175 , whose @entity177 political action committee said it was contributing money to @entity5 and hiring staff to work in @entity64			2
@entity64 @entity49 @entity6 candidate @entity5 and his wife @entity181 , left , take part in a news conference at the start of a statewide bus tour on tuesday the @entity186 , which backs conservative candidates , also said earlier this week that it planned a $ 250,000 advertising campaign benefiting @entity5			1
but @entity5 will need even more outside help to keep pace with @entity96 - leaning groups supporting @entity8			2
@entity100 and the @entity192 issued a joint statement thursday saying they had bought $ 1 million in ads in support of @entity8 to run in the state 's largest tv markets			0
the @entity96 , which already has spent about $ 1 million on tv ads in @entity64 , has reserved $ 4.3 million of additional advertising to begin running october 9			0
the final deadline for candidates to remove their names from the @entity64 ballot passed tuesday as @entity5 began his statewide bus tour , challenging @entity8			1
@entity39 , including @entity50 , have urged him to drop out			1
he 's also lost backing from the national @entity49			0
but late on tuesday @entity64 sen. @entity205 , who 'd called on @entity5 to quit last month , reversed himself , saying he and @entity206 agreed ' the @entity6 majority must change			1
' after winning the @entity49 primary in august , @entity5 had gained quick backing from national @entity49 and conservative groups focused on ousting @entity8			2
but that support withered after @entity5 was asked in an interview that aired on a @entity123 television station whether his general opposition to abortion extended to women who have been raped			0
@entity5 has lost the support of the national @entity49 , but remains confident of defeating @entity96 sen. @entity8 ' from what i understand from doctors , that 's really rare , ' @entity5 said of a woman becoming pregnant from rape			1
' if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			2
' in the media storm immediately following his remarks , @entity5 apologized repeatedly on national radio and tv shows while acknowledging his original remarks were wrong			0
the chairman of the @entity235 urged @entity5 to quit the @entity6 race , as did presumptive @entity49 presidential nominee @entity50 , his vice presidential pick @entity57 and every living @entity49 who has represented @entity64 in the @entity6			1
@entity5 also has lost the financial support for the political arm of @entity6 republicans and of some powerful interest groups , such as the @entity243 organization that is affiliated with @entity49 strategist @entity244			0
one @entity49 still supporting @entity5 is former presidential candidate @entity121 , who raised money for him in suburban @entity123 on monday			0
at the event , @entity5 said he anticipates national @entity49 groups will resume their support of his candidacy in the days before the election			0
' i think the money ’s going to be coming , ' @entity5 said , adding that the funds he needs to compete with @entity8 ' can come from a lot of different sources			2
' in a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters , @entity5 said he ’s ' not going anywhere ' following pressure from ' party bosses and @entity95 insiders			0

@entity5 *lambasted* @entity8 as being unladylike during campaign stop
deadline passed on tuesday for candidates to remove names from @entity64 ballot
@entity5 generated media *firestorm* last month after his comments about ' legitimate rape '
@entity39 , including @entity50 , urged him to step down
