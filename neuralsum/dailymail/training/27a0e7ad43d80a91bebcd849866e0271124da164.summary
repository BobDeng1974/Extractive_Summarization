by @entity0 an idyllic sun - kissed cricket ground on the south coast of @entity4 could hardly have felt further away from a conflict so bitter and entrenched it is almost impossible to pass comment without being branded either sympathiser or extremist			1
but , through the action of a @entity15 - born @entity14 wearing two bracelets proclaiming ‘ @entity19 ’ and ‘ @entity20 ’ on his left wrist , the consciousness of an audience of cricket fans was pricked on monday			1
while @entity21 received a smack on the wristband from the @entity24 and former @entity4 fast bowler @entity25 toed the ‘ sport and politics do n’t mix ’ line , few others in @entity30 appeared outraged			1
@entity21 is the antithesis of the modern sportsmen so often criticised for being vacuous			2
while they spout cliches and only seem to care about sport and material possessions , this man is different			2
he is intelligent and aware of what ’s going on in the world			0
in a recent interview with this newspaper , he said : ‘ religion is very important to me			0
one of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play cricket			0
there can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of @entity76			0
‘ i feel my job as a @entity14 is to change that and show people what my faith is really like			0
a lot of what is said and written is ridiculous , but that ’s life			0
i just get on with it and try to be as positive as i can			0
’ from the response of the majority in cricket on tuesday , it seems there is a significant difference between @entity21 backing charities looking to provide humanitarian support in a war zone and @entity96 ’s cynical use of the ‘ quenelle ’ gesture — an overtly anti-semitic sign — and the @entity99 had the good sense to recognise this			1
@entity4 ’s cricketers all wore shirts with a message of support for @entity107 on tuesday as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity112			1
@entity107 : the shirt @entity4 plan to wear on day three of the third test against @entity37 ‘ part of the reason we went to war in places like @entity118 was to fight for things like freedom of speech , ’ said corporal @entity115 , who lost both his legs in a suicide bomb attack in @entity118 in 2004 and has been supported by @entity107 since			1
‘ i have no problem with a sportsman or woman making a political statement			0
’ the @entity24 ’s high - handed diktat that he must remove his wristbands will do little to stop other like - minded cricketers following @entity21 ’s lead			1
‘ if i was @entity21 , i would n’t mind getting fined if people realise what ’s going on and one life is saved , ’ said former @entity136 and current @entity137 all - rounder @entity135			1
‘ all we can do is make people aware			0
i can wear the band and if i can find one i will wear it in saturday ’s @entity146 quarter final ( against @entity147 )			2
’ fundraiser : @entity21 featured in a @entity150 post by the @entity151 after he helped raise money for the people of @entity19 in his home city of @entity155 @entity25 said : ‘ he ’s been a silly boy , ’ and there will of course be those who ask — where do we draw the line ? next week will @entity163 ’s bat be branded with ‘ @entity164 ’ ? there will always be those , like @entity25 , who do n’t want sport and politics to cross over			1
why would they ? it is complicated and uncomfortable , distracting from ‘ important ’ things like the rough outside off stump or who will bat at six			0
then there are others , like @entity21 and countless more before him , who think deeply and understand they are role models in their @entity176 would say they understand leadership			2
like it , or hate it , sport and politics always have , and always will , mix.			2

all - rounder @entity21 wore black and white wristbands while batting in @entity4 's first innings of third test at @entity41
@entity24 *regulations* ' do not permit the display of messages that relate to political , religious or racial activities or causes during an international '
@entity99 confirmed on monday they had not given him *permission* to wear the wristbands , but also said they believe he had *n't* committed an *offence*
the *27* - year - old helped raise money for *victims* of @entity19 conflict
@entity21 's *decision* *reignited* *debate* over whether sport and politics should mix
@entity137 all - round @entity135 pledged to wear similar wristband in @entity146 match this weekend
