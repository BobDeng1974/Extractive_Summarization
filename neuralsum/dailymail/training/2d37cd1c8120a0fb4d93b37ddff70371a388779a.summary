but after repeated cycles of treatment in @entity17 and @entity2 , @entity1 is once again stating he is fully fit at a crucial time when his health is the main concern before the october 7 presidential vote			2
perceptions of @entity1 's ability to campaign for the election , and govern afterwards , are crucial among voters in what could be one of @entity2 's tightest elections of recent times			2
