by @entity0 in march last year , photographer @entity1 ventured to @entity2 , @entity3 , the centre of the revolt against president @entity5 , to photograph the fighters there			1
what he found astonished the world			0
in the midst of this brutal civil war in the heart of the @entity12 , an entirely female detachment of fighters who had taken up arms against the regime			1
the photographs he sent back made headlines across the @entity20			0
and now , nearly a year - and - a - half later , his work has been recognised with a gold medal from the @entity23			1
@entity24 is @entity25 , 30 , a married housewife with three children			0

right , @entity38 , 42 , a married housewife with seven children left , @entity41 , 72 , a housewife with three children			0
right , @entity43 , a 20 - year - old widow with three children mr @entity1 met the fighters , some of whom were with their children , in a secret command post inside @entity2			1
many of them had been compelled to fight by injustices and humiliations dealt out by the regime and its henchmen			2
one of them , @entity41 , a 72 - year - old mother - of - three , told him how she had fled wit her to @entity2 after her home in @entity60 was destroyed by bombers			1
' i chose to pick up a weapon and fight the regime , ' she said			2
for another woman among them , @entity28 , a 27 - year - old widowed by the fighting , her motivation was equality for women			2
' i fight for life and freedom , i fight to prove that woman and man are equal , ' she said			0
a third , @entity43 , a widowed mother - of - three aged just 20 , was more nihilistic			0
she said : ' my husband died on the front lines , i will die on the front lines , may @entity80 help us			0
' at the time around 150 women had joined the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in @entity86 - and according to a monitoring group they were playing a key role in the fierce fighting around the city			2
@entity1 met the fighters , some of whom were with children , in a secret command post in @entity2 at the time around 150 women had joined the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in @entity86 - and according to a monitoring group they were playing a key role in the fierce fighting around the city in those days of spring 2013 , @entity3 rebels - many of whom came from rural areas around @entity2 - had seized control of large parts of the city and the regime was on the back foot			1
it looked as if the regime was defeated in the city , despite having broad support among residents			2
but the lack of unity among the disparate rebel battalions , who ranged from the largely secular @entity120 - with whom the women were aligned - to the outwardly @entity115 @entity114 , made organised defence difficult			1
when the regime , backed by fighters from the @entity125 militant group @entity124 , launched its counter-attack in late march , splits among the rebel groups became difficult to paper over , while atrocities committed by some eroded their public support			1
last month the @entity132 reported that as many as 7,000 people have been killed in rebel infighting since january alone , including some 650 civilians caught in the crossfire			0
now as @entity120 special forces make a fresh push on @entity2 , control of the city is again in the balance , with reports that rebel positions are under siege , their supply lines to @entity138 in the north cut off			1
there is no fresh news of the @entity120 's all - female unit , but their memory lives on .			1

@entity1 's photos won a medal from @entity23
they are of women fighters who organised a unit in @entity2 last march
@entity2 's rebel forces are now *besieged* by army units loyal to @entity3 's regime
