on january 16 in @entity4 , a man called @entity3 , was heading home to meet a few friends			0
when he got there , they told him that there was a small dog stranded on one of the @entity13 river islands			1
although @entity3 and his friends headed over in hopes of helping , once they arrived there did n't believe that there was much that could be done without gear and tools			0
they began calling several pet rescue facilities in the area , but only one good @entity25 , a man called @entity27 , who works at a dog shelter in @entity29 , @entity4 , was willing to come to their aide			2
with hardly a second of consideration for his own safety , @entity27 climbed down from the highway overpass and waded across the river to the island where the dog was sitting			1
