@entity1 , 44 , had struggled with her weight since childhood but years of operations has helped her drop to 20 stone and fit in to a size 12 dress			1
now she would like her breasts remodelled by the @entity3 , saying : ' i have worked since i was 15 , paying tax and national insurance , so i have a right to have these operations			1
' two years ago her diet of junk food left her wearing size 32 clothes and unable to climb stairs because it was too exhausting			2
after years of failed dieting and exercising , a desperate miss @entity1 turned to her gp for help and in 2012 was approved for a £ 9,000 @entity3 operation to fit a gastric band			1
thanks to the surgery , and dieting and exercising , the mother - of - two lost a dramatic 18 stone , leaving her with unsightly and uncomfortable excess skin			1
last month miss @entity1 , of @entity37 , went under the knife again and had a tummy tuck on the @entity3 to the tune of £ 14,000			1
but now she wants the excess skin removed from around her breasts			2
she said : ' i feel much more confident now			2
i can wear clothes from nice shops and for the first time i can wear a dress without feeling embarrassed			0
even my teenage daughter has started borrowing clothes off me			0
' i have had an amazing transformation and my life is better in every respect			0
once i have my next procedure then i will feel like a brand new woman			1
' miss @entity1 , a supermarket warehouse worker , is now recovering from her tummy tuck surgery which required nearly 200 stitches			1
she said : ' i know it is controversial to get weight loss surgery on the @entity3 , but people have to understand that patients who need a gastric band have usually struggled with their weight all their lives			1
' some people who struggle with their weight try to commit suicide , or turn to alcohol and drugs			2
if gastric surgery on the @entity3 helps these people , then no - one has the right to criticise			1
' if i had stayed at the weight i was , i would have had a heart attack and died in a matter of years			2
i have two kids and they need their mother			2
' she is currently applying to the @entity3 for funding for an operation to raise and reshape her breasts which have sagged since her dramatic weight loss			1

until recently weight loss surgery has risen year on year in @entity106 , with rates highest in women and those aged 40 - 54 years old			1
but data shows there was a fall of 10 per cent in the number of weight loss procedures carried out between april 2012 and march 2013 , suggesting patients are finding it harder to get referred or treated			2
the new study says doctors might not be correctly identifying or referring those eligible , and there may be too little capacity			0
miss @entity1 said : ' i have to wait to recover from my tummy tuck surgery so it will probably be around eight months before i can have any more surgery			1

' depressed : miss @entity1 said she had struggled with her weight but after her surgery has swapped junk food and sitting still for a new healthy diet and regular exercise in february 2012 miss @entity1 was fitted with a gastric band			1

' you have to be focussed , you have to be in the right frame of mind			0
you need to commit to the weight loss 100 per cent			2
' as soon as she recovered from her gastric band surgery @entity174 began a gruelling exercise regime which included daily floor exercises , power - walking , and using an exercise bike at home			1
