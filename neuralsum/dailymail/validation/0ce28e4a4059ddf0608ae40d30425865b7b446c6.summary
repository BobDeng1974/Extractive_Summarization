sir @entity0 , @entity1 winning coach , gives his views on the good points and bad points of @entity6 's 25 - 13 win over @entity7 in the @entity8 at @entity9			1
the 12 - point win means @entity12 ’s side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely @entity15 title if they can see off @entity17 more convincingly than @entity18 beat @entity7 or @entity19 beat @entity20			1
but the display was strewn with errors and @entity6 delivered less than they should have done , although there were positive signs			1
@entity6 captain @entity25 lifts the @entity26 after @entity6 beat @entity7 , but it was a mixed bag what i liked the creative spark i am enjoying @entity6 ’s creativity and their ability to fashion try - scoring opportunities , even if they must be more clinical in accepting them			1
their first try summed up what is best about this @entity6 side			2
@entity38 is a sublime late passer of the ball and when he works in conjunction with a talent such as @entity43 , who has quick feet , pace and strength , it can prove lethal			2
the caveat is that @entity7 were poor and most top international defences are akin to that which @entity6 encountered in @entity50 , the only @entity8 game this season when the @entity6 backs have been blunted			1
@entity38 is a sublime late passer of the ball and clearly has the composure for @entity57 matches @entity43 has such quick feet and that is an attribute that can be lethal when linked with @entity61 settled at the back @entity61 and @entity63 are now established as starters and an established half - back pairing is a boon to any side			1
equally , i believe the back three of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 are probably the preferred trio going forward and @entity43 is a must at outside centre with the cutting edge he now brings — four tries in four @entity8 games this season			1
a settled side will allow those chances to be created but , more importantly , finished off			0
@entity63 ( right ) is part of an established half - back pairing with @entity61 and that is a boon to any side @entity87 @entity86 @entity88 lock @entity87 is one of the key men for @entity6 , with an athleticism that matches anything in the southern hemisphere			1
he is capable of big plays and hits beyond the ability of others in the pack			0
he will go up another gear against @entity17 on saturday			0
add @entity99 to the mix and @entity6 have arguably the best second - row pairing in world rugby			1
@entity87 is a key man for @entity6 and his athleticism matches anything in the southern hemisphere sniff of a trophy the southern hemisphere teams , and indeed @entity18 and @entity19 , wo n’t be particularly bothered whether @entity6 win the title or not — only @entity108 impress the rugby world at large — but @entity6 winning the title could be important			1
they have won nothing under @entity12 — @entity6 have won only one title since 2003 — so to chalk up a championship would be a useful stepping stone and receiving the trophy at @entity9 would help set up the year ahead			1
that defeat in @entity50 would be my abiding memory of this championship , though			0
@entity6 have won nothing under @entity12 so a championship would be a useful stepping stone plenty in reserve i have studiously avoided mentioning @entity6 ’s injured players in this tournament because if they are unavailable they simply do n’t come into the equation , but moving into the @entity1 forwards @entity130 , @entity131 and , hopefully , @entity132 will add considerably to this side ’s firepower			2
better from the bench @entity6 still have n’t got this entirely right , as they showed against @entity18 , but against the @entity137 on saturday @entity138 and @entity139 , in particular , made a big impact that was n’t quite reflected on the scoreboard			1
there are international players and there are the top international players who can go head to head with the @entity148 and @entity149 — we need the bench full of top players			0
with @entity6 ’s policy of using the bench they will be there in the final 20 minutes where the big games are won and lost			2
@entity138 made a big impact that maybe was n't reflected on the scoreboard , he is a good bench option @entity158 i am really warming to @entity70 , who has returned to the international scene a much better and stronger player than when first blooded last season			0
he ’s industrious and has all - round rugby nous			0
against @entity7 the ball came to him frequently , which is a good sign in a winger			2
the @entity167 man could really kick on now			0
@entity70 scores for @entity6 against @entity7 , he has returned to the international scene a stronger player @entity170 : @entity6 v @entity7 match review and what i did n’t centre headache inside centre			1
we ’ve been here before ! @entity176 has good qualities but has no kicking game and looked on edge yesterday			2
@entity6 need a better ‘ footballing ’ 12 and might have @entity180 in mind , but he has endured an injury - hit 12 months and does he fit into the dynamic of @entity6 ’s back line ? you would think @entity186 must play some role but is he similar to @entity176 ? if not , where do you play him and who do you drop ? @entity190 could well be a strong contender but @entity6 have been reluctant to blood him , which is a badly missed opportunity			1
@entity176 has good qualities but no kicking game , @entity6 need a better ' fooballing ' 12 in the side @entity196 @entity61 clearly has composure at @entity198 but others do not — so much so that gilt - edged opportunities went begging against @entity7			1
the excitement and / or pressure of @entity57 rugby is causing mistakes			0
experience will help considerably but also highly pressurised coaching will help too			0
@entity61 has the composure required for @entity57 level but the @entity7 game showed that others do not missed the boat it is too late now to integrate @entity213 and @entity214 into your starting team			1
@entity61 is my first - choice 10 but i would have started @entity213 against the @entity137 as we had to see him in a competitive match			1
@entity6 can not start either against @entity17 now and that ’s the only match that matters before the @entity1 , the only real test			1
we have seriously missed the boat with these two			2
i would have started @entity213 against the @entity137 as we had to see him in a competitive match paying the penalty there were 13 penalties against @entity18 and 10 against the @entity137 , which is still too high			1
and it ’s when they occur that is important , too			0
@entity6 are conceding too many penalties when either in no immediate danger from opponents or needlessly when on the attack — for instance , @entity232 going in on the angle in the first half when @entity6 had the @entity7 scrum on toast and it was odds on for a pushover try			1
in the second half @entity243 was very lucky not to get a yellow card for diving in			0
on another day it could cost you the @entity1			0
@entity6 are conceding too many penalties needlessly such as @entity250 ( centre ) going in on the angle sloppy set - pieces the @entity6 line - out has been strong but it must be better , the very best in the world			2
@entity6 must continue to chase line - out perfection , to drill those routines until they ca n’t go wrong			2
the scrum , one of the key weapons , has at best been 50 - 50 in the last two tests			0
we must get it back to its best for what is to come			0
the @entity6 line - out has been strong but it must be better , the very best in the world , reaching perfection kick in the teeth @entity61 is good but he is not a world - class kicker yet at @entity198 , and he missed two shots again on saturday			1
@entity6 need to address this			2
@entity61 is still developing and can improve his percentages , but they need alternatives			2
in my opinion , @entity180 is their best goal - kicker so how is that factored into team selection ? the standard is @entity282			0
drop goals just do not seem to register with @entity6			0
just study the history of the @entity1 to understand why they matter , especially in the big games			0
@entity282 is the standard in terms of world - class kickers , @entity61 is good but not at that level yet @entity291 ’s our fortress ? @entity292 : @entity6 ’s magnificent home ground still is n’t the citadel it needs to be for the @entity1			1
it is a home and not a fortress			0
the crowd must raise their game against @entity17			0
a championship will be at stake and @entity6 fans need to show just how badly that matters to them			0
it does make a difference — we have home advantage and this could still be the key to @entity6 success			0
going in to the final weekend of the @entity8 , four teams - @entity6 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy			1
here 's how each can be victorious			0
@entity6 ’s home ground still is n’t the citadel it needs to be for the @entity1 , it is a home and not a fortress			0

@entity6 beat @entity7 25 - 13 at @entity9 in the @entity8
the display was full of errors but there were positives to take forward
@entity6 showed a great amount of creativity and ability to create chances
@entity38 and @entity63 have established a good half - back pairing
@entity87 will go up a gear and is brilliant with @entity99
@entity6 need a better ' footballing ' 12 than @entity176
not everyone can match the sort of composure that @entity61 has at test level
@entity6 have missed the boat on @entity213 and @entity214
