when you ca n't force your own employees to get on board with a product , what hope does a company have convincing the rest of us ? such is the case this week at internet giant @entity10 , who have been left red - faced after an staff memo found its way out of the @entity15 headquarters , according to @entity16 the note - from @entity10 senior vice president of communications products , @entity19 , and @entity20 , @entity22 - details how only 25 per cent of employees use the company 's email offering			1
struggling : following thousands of complains from furious users following a redesign in october , it has now been revealed that @entity10 mail is not even resonating among company employees , with only 25 per cent using it as their email destination , according to a leaked memo home : the leaked memo , from @entity10 senior vice president of communications products , @entity19 , and cio @entity22 , came from inside @entity10 's @entity15 headquarters to add insult to embarrassment , that is after executives exhorted everyone to make the switch from @entity46 's outlook			1
taking a swipe at their competitor , the title of the @entity10 email memo was : ' @entity52 called and they want their mail app back			1
' another part of the quirky note to staff says that ' ( @entity58 is ) an anachronism of the now defunct 90s pc era '			1
some tech insiders have suggested the memo was written with the expectation it could leak to the media			1
memo writer : @entity10 senior vide president of communications products , @entity19 ( pictured ) wrote the quirky email with cio @entity22 ' certainly , we can admire the application for its survival , an anachronism of the now defunct 90s pc era , a pre-web program written at a time when @entity76 terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a @entity80 born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son ’s utter uniqueness because the big - mouthed , tiny - armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of @entity87 , ' the pair wrote , according to @entity16 ' we have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to @entity90			1
' it does n’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana			2
' at this point in your life , @entity58 may be familiar , which we can often confuse with productive or well designed			1
' no comment : @entity10 president , @entity99 , is yet to comment on the staff memo being made public @entity90 has come under fire in recent weeks following an expansive re-design in october			1
many of the 300 million users have complained as part of the changes , @entity10 removed the ability to see multiple emails at once			1
there was such outrage over the new @entity90 that a @entity112 petition called ' @entity10 : bring back the old version of @entity90 ! '' , which has garnered almost 39,000 signatures			1
@entity10 has said that it 's ' listening to all of the community feedback ' regarding the changes			1
@entity118 , earlier this year we asked you to move to @entity90 for your corporate email account			1
25 % of you made the switch ( thank you )			1
but even if we used the most generous of grading curves ( say , the one from organic chemistry ) , we have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to @entity127 ’s time for the remaining 75 % to make the switch			2
beyond the practical benefits of giving feedback to your colleagues on the mail team , as a company it ’s a matter of principle to use the products we make			2
( btw , same for @entity138			2
) for some reading this email , you are saying , “ @entity19 , shut up , you had me at hello			0
” * hug * jump over to yo / dogfood , click “ @entity147 / @entity146 ” and you are ready to join our brave new world at yo / corpmail or @entity151 others , you might now be running in your head to a well worn path of justified resistance , phoning up the ol ’ gang , circling the hippocampian wagons of amygdalian resistance			0
hold on a sec , @entity161 , it does n’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana			0
at this point in your life , @entity58 may be familiar , which we can often confuse with productive or well designed			1
certainly , we can admire the application for its survival , an anachronism of the now defunct 90s @entity172 era , a pre-web program written at a time when @entity76 terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a @entity80 born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son ’s utter uniqueness because the big - mouthed , tiny - armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of @entity87			0
there was a similar outcry when we moved away from @entity58 ’s suite - mates in the @entity188 dreadnaught			1
but whether it ’s familiarity , laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of @entity193 , the time has come to move on , commrade [ sic ... go deep in this pun , it is layered ]			0
using corp mail from the @entity199 web interface is remarkably feature rich			2
it supports booking conference rooms , folders , calendar , filters and global address book			0
plus , you get built - in @entity146 , smart conversation threading , powerful keyboard shortcuts , the new quick actions , attachment preview and our beautiful new rich themes			0
in the rare case you do need @entity58 , like adding a delegate for your calendar , you can still fire up outlook for 30 seconds.but wait there ’s more			1
by using corporate mail , you ’ll automatically get to dogfood our new features first			2
i ’m especially excited about a new feature premiering in just a few more days : smart auto - suggest , powered by a platform from the still - have - that - new - acquisition - smell @entity224 team			0
we have been testing this feature with select users in and out of the company and the response has been fantastic : “ whoa ! ” , “ @entity229 ” , “ already in love with it			2
@entity232 ! ” and , my favorite , “ so nicely integrated that it appears as if it ’s always been there			0
i already ca n’t imagine it not being there again			0
” feeling that little tingle ? take a deep breath , you can do this			0
we want you on board , sailor ! please note , on the mobile side , corp mail is not yet supported in our mail app for @entity246 or @entity247 , but that will change ( @entity249 ! )			2
and , like all dogfood offerings , there is a feedback link in the product			0
use it generously so we can make the improvements to make @entity90 the unquestioned inbox champion of the world			0
i pitty [ sic ] the fool who resists			0
it really does matter and we appreciate it			0
@entity19 , @entity265 , cio			0
