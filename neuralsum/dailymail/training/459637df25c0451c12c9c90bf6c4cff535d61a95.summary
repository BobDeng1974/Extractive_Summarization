rangers were sentenced to death after @entity2 torpedoed @entity4 ’s hopes of preserving the club in its current form via a cva			1
the revenue , who are owed over £ 21million by the beleaguered @entity11 club , rendered thursday ’s scheduled creditors ’ meeting a formality by declaring they would oppose the proposal — thus ensuring the liquidation of @entity0 plc , incorporated in 1899			1
@entity4 had hoped his £ 8.5m offer would be enough to win the day , but with 38 per cent of the current £ 55m debt belonging to @entity2 and 75 - per - cent creditor approval required , their compliance was central to his plans			1
scroll down to hear from some @entity0 fans blow : the @entity7 deal will not be allowed the @entity25 , who last night launched a broadside at @entity2 for ‘ misleading ’ him , will now complete his purchase of @entity0 ’ assets — @entity11 , @entity31 and the @entity32 — for £ 5.5m at the end of this week			1
and the former @entity35 chief executive will attempt to persuade the @entity36 to admit a newco @entity0 into the top flight next season in the coming month			1
the new incarnation would require eight of the 12 club representatives to approve the move — a vote is likely to take place at the agm on july 16 — but , if the newco entry is blocked , the new @entity0 are likely to apply to join the @entity47 — with @entity48 , who were runners - up in the @entity51 , replacing them in the top flight			1
regardless of what division they are playing in next season , the newco will be unable to compete in @entity58 football for three seasons			0
it will also require the approval of the @entity62 to compete in any league			0
bad news : @entity4 confirmed the blow and in another potential flashpoint for the club , @entity4 and administrator @entity66 are adamant the contracts of players will automatically transfer over to the new company — an issue hotly disputed by the players ’ union , @entity75 , and a number of leading agents			1
on a day of extraordinary drama , which came 120 days after the club entered administration , @entity4 reacted furiously to the mid-morning news that the revenue would not back his plan			1
‘ it ’s massively disappointing and i think to some extent we have been misled by @entity2 , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity66 have consistently said to me that they were in dialogue with @entity2 and that they had n’t rejected the @entity7 route			1
‘ irrespective of what i was being told by @entity2 , my own advisors at @entity92 have been in dialogue with them , too			1
‘ to see them today saying this is a policy decision leaves me speechless			0
‘ if that ’s the case , is that a policy that was invented this week ? takeover turmoil : @entity0 future hangs in the balance ‘ if not , why were n’t we told that in february or march ? we could have gone into a newco then and saved a huge amount of money and time			1
‘ it would also have removed the false hope from @entity0 fans			1
’ according to a statement from @entity2 , ‘ liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers , by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company ’s financial affairs in recent years ’			2
@entity2 also stressed their decision did not undermine the sale of the club but would allow @entity0 a ‘ fresh start ’			1
however , @entity4 insists any investigation into former directors should not necessarily have precluded @entity2 from agreeing to a cva			1
he added : ‘ i ’m not a lawyer but , if a former director has done something wrong , he should be pursued			0
what next ? rangers face liquidation ‘ i do n’t believe turning down a cva is a price worth paying to pursue previous directors			0
’ @entity4 promised to finally name his investors following the creditors ’ meeting , saying : ‘ we ’ll reveal who is on the board , what the names of the directors are and all of the things the fans , the @entity62 and the @entity36 are looking to see			2
‘ the consortium ’s capabilities are not affected at all			0
’ @entity4 was given ‘ preferred - bidder ’ status by @entity66 last month ahead of rival bidders like the @entity145 , a consortium including former @entity0 ’ director @entity146 and businessman @entity147			1
joint administrator @entity148 last night closed the door on any rival bid for the club ’s assets being considered , claiming the agreement with @entity4 ’s @entity155 consortium was ‘ binding ’			2
men for the job : @entity158 and @entity159 from @entity66 administrators ‘ we made it clear to the @entity145 and others some weeks ago when we got to the stage of agreeing @entity4 ’s offer , what the position was , ’ @entity148 explained			2
‘ i very much expect that sale to be concluded later this week but not until after the @entity7 is rejected on thursday			2
’ @entity148 predicted that the existing company would be wound up in the autumn			0
‘ to be honest , i do n’t know exactly how quickly , but i would suspect it would take six to 10 weeks , ’ he said			0
‘ one of the issues is there ’s some ongoing litigation in relation to @entity177 including a hearing in october and what we would n’t want to do is have a situation where that is harmed in any way			0
so we need to think that through			0
’ @entity66 , administrators : we have been informed by @entity2 they will not support the proposal for a @entity186 at the meeting of creditors on thursday , june 14			2
as a result of this decision , the @entity191 in place with the consortium led by @entity4 will take effect and @entity0 will continue within a new company structure			1
the reasons @entity2 have given to us for their decision to vote against the proposal are as follows			2
@entity2 has cited its general policy of not agreeing to a cva where there is strong evidence of non-compliance by a company with its tax liabilities			2
@entity2 had agreed to consider a @entity7 proposal along with all other options in the case of @entity0 but having taken into consideration the extent of funds which will be made available to creditors through the @entity7 option , they have decided that it is not acceptable given @entity155 plc 's level of indebtedness to @entity2			1
it has also been made clear to us that other offers tendered for @entity220 , which took the form of a @entity7 , would have been treated in the same way and that the rejection is not a reflection of the @entity4 consortium bid			1
@entity2 has taken the view that the public interest will be better served with the liquidation of @entity155 plc as a corporate entity			2
@entity231 will continue to operate as it has always done but within a new company structure			0
@entity2 consider that the decision will enable a liquidator to instigate a wider investigation into all of the financial affairs and management of the @entity0 in recent years and to bring to task those they believe are responsible for its collapse			1
furthermore , @entity2 believes there will be an enhanced recovery of funds for creditors by pursuing those individuals who they believe are responsible			2
the consequence of the rejection of a @entity7 outcome is that sanctions will be applied to the club by @entity252 and that the @entity0 will not be able to participate in @entity252 for three years and the new company will need the consent of the other @entity36 clubs to the transfer of the share in the @entity36 , in order for @entity0 to continue playing in the @entity36			1
as we have always stated , administrators have a primary objective to ensure the survival of the company and in this case , this would have been achieved through a cva			0
it was with @entity2 's approval , that a proposal was placed before creditors for consideration			2
however , it is the commercial view that the level offered within the @entity7 was not enough to merit departure from their normal policy of seeking a detailed investigation via a liquidator			2
however , we have been left in no doubt by @entity2 the fundamental reason for the rejection of the @entity7 proposal is the historical non-compliance with tax liabilities by the former owners and directors of the @entity0			1
as we have stated previously , there is a binding contract between ourselves as administrators and @entity4 , who is leading a consortium to acquire the @entity0			1
the creditors ' and shareholders ' meetings will take place at @entity11 on thursday but the results of those meetings will now be entirely academic given @entity2 's decision			0
as soon as the @entity7 proposal is formally rejected , mr @entity4 's consortium will move towards completion of an acquisition of the business and assets of @entity155 plc. that transaction will be completed within a few days			1
the sum payable to creditors will be £ 5.5 million , most of which has already been paid over to us by the @entity4 consortium			0
over the coming months , we as administrators will continue to finalise the administration of the @entity0 and we will work in conjunction with @entity310 who will undertake the liquidation process			0
we would like to thank the staff and supporters at @entity0 for their great determination and professionalism during a very difficult period for the @entity0			0
while the @entity0 will continue to face difficulties in the short term , it will survive and continue to play at @entity11			0
@entity2 : a liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers , by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company 's financial affairs in recent years			0
a @entity7 would restrict the scope of such action			0
moreover the liquidation route does not prejudice the proposed sale of the club			0
this sale can take place either through a cva or a liquidation			0
so the sale is not being undermined , it simply takes a different route			0
liquidation will enable a sale of the football assets to be made to a new company , thereby ensuring that football will continue at @entity11			0
it also means that the new company will be free from claims or litigation in a way which would not be achievable with a cva			0
@entity0 can make a fresh start .			0

@entity0 to be liquidated
@entity2 say no to a @entity7
