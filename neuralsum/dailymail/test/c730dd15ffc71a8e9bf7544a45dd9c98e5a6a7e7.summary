@entity0 and @entity1 , from @entity2 , @entity3 , have been firmly in the anti-vaccination camp , that is until their seven children contracted whooping cough			1
at first , mrs hills thought her kids had a bad cold , but then she heard their deep , booming cough that made them gag and vomit - ' the kind of cough that stops a parent 's heart , ' she recalled to @entity15			2
after looking up the symptoms online - powerful coughing fits , runny nose , stringy phlegm - the @entity19 took their ailing brood to the hospital on the morning of april 2			0
according to @entity50 , before a vaccine was developed , whooping cough - also known as pertussis - killed up to 10,000 people in the @entity54 annually			1
the introduction of the vaccine has reduced the number of fatalities caused by the infection each year to 30 , but in recent years the number of cases has been on the rise			0
@entity63 said she and her husband had their first three children partially vaccinated , but then stopped because they have grown suspicious of what she described on her blog , @entity70 , as the ' @entity72 conspiracy			1
' weary : @entity0 wrote that she and her husband decided to stop vaccinating their children because they did n't trust the health care system at risk : the @entity19 ' three eldest kids were partially vaccinated , but the four youngest ones got no shots at all , leaving them vulnerable ' were these vaccines even necessary in this day and age ? ' mrs hills wrote			1
' were we unwittingly doing greater harm than help to our beloved children ? so much smoke must mean a fire so we defaulted to the " do nothing and hope nothing bad happens " position			0
' the @entity19 first began questioning their controversial anti-vaxxer stance after hearing of a massive measles outbreak at @entity95 earlier this year			0
at first , the parents ' fear of contagion proved weaker than their mistrust of the medical system			0
but then @entity0 and her husband started looking at information from government agencies and reputable health organizations			2
in an ironic twist - one of many in the story of the @entity19 ' evolution as anti-vaxxers - their children have been scheduled to get their first shots soon when whooping cough struck , reported @entity113			1
' i looked again at the science and evidence for community immunity and found myself gripped with a very real sense of personal and social responsibility before @entity120 and man , ’ @entity63 wrote on her blog , adding that one of her main concerns was that her kids may have infected her sister 's unvaccinated infant			2
the @entity19 ' youngest children are still battling the illness , but are expected to recover her six sons and a daughter ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years have been ordered to remain in quarantine at their house in @entity2 until they stop being contagious , which will take five days			1
on thursday , mrs @entity136 said her two eldest children have turned a corner and are now on the mend , while the younger kids are still battling the illness with the help of antibiotics			2
in her blog post titled @entity145 : my journey from # @entity147 to @entity148 , which has been viewed more than 2million times , @entity1 acknowledged the awkward position she has found herself in			1
' i ’m writing this from quarantine , the irony of which is n’t lost on me , ' she wrote			0
' i am not looking forward to any gloating or shame as this ' defection ' from the antivaxx camp goes public , but this is n't a popularity contest			0
right now my family is living the consequences of misinformation and fear			0

@entity0 and @entity1 , from @entity3 , stopped vaccinating their children six years *ago* after losing trust in the health care system
all seven @entity63 kids , between ages of 10 months and 10 years , came down with whooping cough last week
@entity63 did an about - face in the wake of her family 's health crisis , writing a blog post about how her stance on vaccination has changed
