@entity0 will attend his 58th masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game ’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport ’s finest accomplishments			1
the great man considers @entity10 completing the career @entity12 at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen			1
so you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of @entity18 becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25			1
‘ i ’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be , ’ said the @entity22 legend			1
‘ when i completed my slam at 29 i said to my wife that you will never see that done again			2
then @entity31 came along and did it at 26 and then @entity10 at 24			2
@entity31 watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the @entity37 golf tournament in @entity38 in 1986 @entity18 meets up with @entity22 golf legend @entity0 during the pro-am in 2009 @entity18 , pictured in action at the @entity41 , and is favourite to win the masters ‘ now we have @entity18 , and i tell you this : i honestly believe he is going to do it			1
i just believe everything is going to fall into place for him , that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right			2
’ it is not hard to see why @entity0 would have such a special affinity for @entity18			1
two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the @entity57 in the majors in their own backyard ; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism			2
it was @entity0 , of course , who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness			1
@entity69 , he is still doing 1,300 sit - ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now , at the age of 79			0
he is withering in his contempt of those who say @entity18 is ‘ bulking up ’ too much in the gym			1
‘ i ’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and do n’t watch what they eat , ’ he says			0
‘ just because they ’re lazy , they ca n’t grasp that fitness is so vital			0
@entity80 presents @entity0 with a @entity81 after the @entity82 at @entity83 ‘ i was told that because i was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and i would n’t win any tournaments after the age of 34			1
i was told i had no chance of winning the @entity90 if i was squatting 325lb the previous evening			0
‘ i ’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier			0
i used to go down to the local @entity98 wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment			0
but it you want to be a superstar , and by a superstar i mean a player who has won at least six majors , there are no short cuts			1
@entity10 could pose a threat to @entity18 at the masters after confirming that he will play at @entity38 ‘ @entity18 will be an absolute superstar when he wins the masters			1
and yes , i can see a lot of similarities with myself			0
i love the fact he is a people person , for example , and engages with the fans			0
that ’s what i used to love , and still do			0
so many pros ca n’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it ’s so wrong			0
’ player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career @entity12 is a modern media invention			2
‘ i tell you it was electrifying when i completed it in 1965 , ’ he said			0
‘ i so wanted to follow @entity126 and particularly @entity127 and become the third player to achieve it , because @entity127 was the best player i ’d seen			2
@entity31 and i were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice @entity31 gave me that helped me over the line			0
‘ i was due to play a tournament at @entity136 in 1965 when @entity31 said if i wanted to win the @entity90 and complete the set i should go with him to the @entity90 site and practise			2
i said i needed the money , that i had loads of children to look after , but i went with him			0
so he played a key role			0
@entity18 manages a smile after throwing away a four - shot lead on the final day of the masters in 2011 @entity31 waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the @entity152 golf tournament ‘ it was amazing afterwards			1
everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing			0
how on earth could it happen ? ’ @entity0 and @entity31 have remained lifelong friends			1
they will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before @entity0 heads to @entity169 for his 80th birthday celebrations			1
‘ there will be 35 people there and @entity31 and i will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it , ’ said @entity0 , laughing			1
as for @entity38 , he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on thursday alongside @entity31 and @entity177			0
and then , 50 years on from his own date with history , he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another @entity181 can complete the set of majors and join him on what former @entity90 champion @entity184 evocatively refers to as golf ’s @entity185 .			2

@entity0 considers @entity188 at 24 as best golfing feat
@entity22 will attend his 58th masters this week at @entity83
player is excited at the prospect of @entity18 joining exclusive club
@entity18 could become only the sixth player to win all four majors
