by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 10:29 est , 3 december 2013 have you ever felt the urge to lie to everybody , ruin the livelihoods of thousands , and make millions of pounds in the process ? well now you can - and you do n't even have to go to public school first			1
a pair of businessmen have found a way to channel the urges that crippled the world 's economy in 2008 without actually harming anybody - a family board game where everybody plays as a banker			2
designers : @entity18 , left , and @entity19 , right , put the game together over the last year playing with the economy : the @entity23 game encourages players to invest recklessly in different markets , which they move between with the roll of the dice wildcards : players are encouraged to double - cross each other with cynical cards like those above the @entity33 , made by father and son @entity35 and @entity19 , encourages players to lie through their teeth , gamble with other people 's money , and go running to the authorities when it all comes tumbling down			1
the @entity42 - style board game casts players as the chief executives of fictitious banks with names like @entity47 and the @entity48			1
the aim is to invest the bank 's cash as recklessly as possible without getting caught , and take home the biggest bonus			0
each turn the bankers get an opportunity to invest a secret amount of money - measured in billions - in markets like stocks , property and mortgages			0
depending on which square they land on , players might get to cash in their investments - and get their hands on a bonus - or ruthlessly crash the market and leave their opponents with nothing			1
the first banker to trouser £ 10million is declared the winner			0
as well as being encouraged to bluff and lie about the level of their investments , players can also use ' really nasty ' cards to fiddle the markets , call in the regulators or trick other players into being ' out to lunch ' when it 's time to cash in			1
and , as a tribute to the financial crash of 2008 where @entity85 and @entity86 were bailed out by taxpayers , players also have recourse to a ' public bailout ' card			2
if a market collapses while they are heavily invested in it , the player is allowed to keep all their money			0
bunch of bankers : players invest on behalf of cynically - named institutions such as @entity99 loadsamoney : the aim of the game is to take home the biggest bonus payment , measured in millions it has been developed over the past year by @entity19 , who was involved in marketing @entity106 and the @entity109 boardgame			1
along with his son @entity35 , the pair , from @entity112 in @entity113 , have arranged for the game to be stocked in @entity115 and on @entity116 , where it retails for £ 19.99			2
mr @entity18 said : ' people might not have been very interested in it 10 years ago			2
' but with what 's happening in the current financial climate , now is the right time to bring the game out			0
' ' it 's all about sabotaging other players ' plans			0
it 's a cynical setup - you 're encouraged to lie and as long as you get away with it you win ' ' my ex-bank manager - who has tried out the game and thinks it 's really funny - got a whizzkid from the city to help us with the different investments and advise us on how they should fit into the game			1
' we have simplified the system and made it fun			0
it 's a great game for winding people up and it really brings out different personalities			0

the really @entity33 casts players as fictional *fatcats*
players must slyly make investments to *max* out their bonuses
they are also encouraged to crash the market and double - cross foes
wildcards let players on the back foot call on @entity162 bailouts to *salvage* their investments
the game was developed by @entity19 and @entity18 from @entity113
