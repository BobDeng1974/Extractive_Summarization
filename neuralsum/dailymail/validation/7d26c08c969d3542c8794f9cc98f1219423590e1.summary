@entity0 has branded @entity2 ’s crunch end - of - season clash with @entity3 as ‘ colossal ’ — and vowed that @entity5 ’s men are capable of leaving @entity6 with three more crucial points on the road to @entity9			1
the goalscoring hero when the two nations met last november at @entity12 , @entity0 believes the pressure will be off the scale when the @entity16 nations collide for the return at the @entity18 on june 13			1
the @entity19 currently lie in third place in @entity21 , one point behind leaders @entity24 , level with world champions @entity27 and two points ahead of the @entity29			1
@entity2 currently lie in third place in @entity21 after saturday 's 6 - 1 victory over @entity32 it has been a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign as @entity2 aim to reach the nation ’s first major finals since the @entity38 in @entity39			1
and @entity0 insists @entity5 ’s side can grab the win that would all but end @entity3 ’s hopes of reaching @entity39 next year if they reprise their form against the @entity29 four months ago			1
however , he admitted @entity2 ’s 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity45 four days later serves as a reminder not to let standards slip			1
‘ the @entity3 game in june is going to be absolutely colossal , ’ said @entity0 , who now plays with @entity48 in @entity50 ’s @entity49			1
@entity2 have enjoyed a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign ‘ the pressure on both sides will just build and build as we get closer			2
but i think we can go there and win the game			2
‘ however , we have to know that we can also lose it if we are not as good as we have been in recent games			2
‘ look at our game against @entity3 in november and the @entity24 away game when we drew 2 - 2			1
we played well and got results			0
‘ but then look at the @entity45 match , when we were a little bit off it			0
the better side defeated us			0
‘ so we have to be very aware of why we have got ourselves into this position and what we need to continue doing			0
’ @entity0 insists @entity2 ’s ability to handle the intense pressure ahead of that first @entity3 match in @entity74 and to emerge with a fine win was a key moment in the development of the team under @entity5			1
@entity0 was the goalscoring hero when the two nations met last november at @entity12 and he warned it will be the turn of the @entity29 in june to see if they can handle the heat of what is now a must - win match for @entity86 ’s side			2
‘ the pressure when we played @entity3 at @entity12 was huge , ’ said @entity0 , whose two goals in @entity2 ’s 6 - 1 win over @entity32 on sunday leaves him as the highest scorer in @entity5 ’s squad with a total of six			1
‘ it was a pressure for a match ( against @entity3 ) that i had n’t felt for a long time			2
so for the team to cope with that was a pretty big step			0
‘ i think we ’ve made some pretty big steps in the last 18 months			0
but that was probably as big a one we ’ve made as a group of players for a while			0
‘ the pressure will now be magnified for the @entity29 being at home and it ’s a brilliant game to be involved in			0
‘ i have learned , though , that they are only brilliant if you win them			0
they sound great on paper , but they are not that enjoyable when you do n’t win			0
