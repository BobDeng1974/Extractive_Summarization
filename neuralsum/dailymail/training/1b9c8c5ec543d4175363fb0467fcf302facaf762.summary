in a stadium named after a @entity4 war general from the early 1800s , @entity0 and @entity1 set about proving they were worthy leaders in @entity7 ’s attacking quartet			1
the @entity8 has become the pair ’s stomping ground and both started in the visit to the @entity13 against @entity14 in @entity15 that is a luxury neither has been afforded in the @entity19 by @entity20 but , with a goal apiece in @entity4 in this 2 - 1 win , they staked their claim			1

the attacker has not enjoyed life under @entity20 as much as he did under @entity46			0
but here in @entity4 , he had a point to prove to himself and his critics a year after scoring a 25 - yard strike against @entity51 that all but guaranteed @entity36 would travel to @entity52 for the @entity53			2
@entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 remain ahead in the pecking order at @entity59 , but @entity1 ’s first goal of the season for the north @entity63 club can go a long way			2
in the 37th minute a penalty gave him that very chance			0
immediately after @entity7 were awarded a penalty , @entity1 grabbed the ball , making it painfully clear that no - one else was taking it but him			1
@entity0 leaped above @entity14 ' defence to score what turned out to be the winning goal for @entity7 @entity36 international @entity1 , pictured challenging @entity73 , impressed against the @entity4 outfit a tidy finish rippled the right of the net , despite @entity14 goalkeeper @entity28 diving the correct way , and the relief was there for the travelling @entity7 fans to see behind the goal			1
then , @entity1 turned provider as @entity20 switched him from the right side to the left , which later turned out to be a shrewd move			2

but , with @entity97 left behind in @entity63 , @entity20 ’s apparent third - choice striker took to the stage			0
a fine cross by @entity1 was inviting , and @entity0 nodded it beyond @entity28 to double the lead before half - time			1

@entity0 is poised to lose his starting place in sunday ’s @entity19 match against @entity117 after this energetic performance , despite scoring a last - minute winner against @entity120 a week ago			2
the mood in @entity122 was that this was the biggest match in the @entity4 club ’s history			0
win , and @entity15 was tipped on its head			0
