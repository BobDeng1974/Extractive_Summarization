by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 21:04 est , 10 september 2012 we have already become familiar with the sight of @entity3 on the @entity5 surface , but @entity6 today revealed one of the most human - like images of the rover , showing its ' face ' on the surface of the red planet			2
the image was taken moments before engineers sent commands to remove the dust covers from one of @entity3 's most important cameras for the first time			1
it was then calibrated using a ' lucky penny ' hidden on the rover 's arm , before taking a series of astonishing shots of its wheels on the red planet 's surface			1
@entity6 today revealed stunning new images of @entity3 's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution @entity34 camera , which had its dustcover removed for the first time with dust cover : the curiosity rover used a camera located on its arm to obtain this self portrait , taken before engineers removed its dust cover the images were taken with the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) camera			1
' the self - focusing , roughly 4 - centimeter - wide ( 1.5 - inch - wide ) camera will take color images of features as small as 12.5 micrometers , smaller than the diameter of a human hair			0
' @entity34 carries both white light sources , similar to the light from a flashlight , and ultraviolet light sources , similar to the light from a tanning lamp , making the imager functional both day and night			2
' the ultraviolet light will be used to induce fluorescence to help detect carbonate and evaporite minerals , both of which indicate that water helped shape the landscape on @entity5			0
' the team have also revealed the first evidence of @entity3 carrying cash			0
engineers placed a lucky penny onboard to allow the rover to calibrate its camera			1
it is a 1909 " @entity80 " cent , from the first year @entity76 pennies were minted , the centennial of @entity76 's birth , with the @entity80 initials of the coin 's designer - @entity80 -- on the reverse			0
@entity34 's close - up inspections of @entity5 rocks and soil will show details so tiny , the calibration target includes reference lines finer than a human hair			1
@entity6 â€™s staff say the penny is a nod to an age old trick used on earth			0
' when a geologist takes pictures of rock outcrops she is studying , she wants an object of known scale in the photographs , ' said @entity34 principal investigator @entity103 , of @entity104 , @entity105			2
' if it is a whole cliff face , she 'll ask a person to stand in the shot			0
' if it is a view from a meter or so away , she might use a rock hammer			0
' if it is a close - up , as the @entity34 can take , she might pull something small out of her pocket			2
' open : the reclosable dust cover on @entity3 's @entity34 ( @entity34 ) was opened for the first time during the 33rd @entity5 day , or sol , of the rover 's mission on @entity5 wheels down : @entity6 used the newly uncovered @entity34 camera to take a series of images of the rover 's wheel on the red planet 's surface the new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that @entity3 will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet the images also reveal @entity3 's large wheels and distinctive tyre tracks , which leave morse code messages on the surface as it travels the team calibrated the camera using a ' lucky penny ' on the rover 's mast video : @entity6 scientists explain where @entity3 currently is on its mission ...			1

engineers reveal they have removed the dust lens from 2 *megapixel* @entity34 camera
has been used to photograph ' lucky penny ' on the rover 's arm to calibrate the camera
