by @entity0 genetic liver disease has been cured in living , adult mice for first time using a ‘ jaw - dropping ’ genome - editing technique that could soon be used on humans			1
the technique , named @entity8 , can make tiny changes to the huge database of the dna molecule with what scientists describe as ' pinpoint ' accuracy			1
@entity8 – pronounced ‘ crisper ’ - was used to correct a single ‘ letter ’ of the mices ' genetic alphabet which had been mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism			1
the technique , named @entity8 , can make tiny changes to the huge database of the @entity11 molecule with what scientists describe as ' pinpoint ' accuracy scientists claim a similar mutation in the same gene causes the inherited liver disease in humans , raising hopes that clinical trials on patients could begin in the next few years			1
they believe detailed alterations can be made to @entity11 , potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle - cell anaemia , @entity35 's syndrome and @entity37 ’s disease			1
the new technique uses ‘ cutting enzymes ’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes , without introducing unintended mutations or flaws			1
the enzymes were discovered in 1987 and initially dismissed as ‘ junk dna ’			1
it has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses			0
genetic liver disease has been cured in living , adult mice for first time using a ' jaw - dropping - genome - editing technique that could soon be used on humans the technique could mean detailed alterations can be made to @entity11 , potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle - cell anaemia ( pictured ) , down syndrome and @entity37 's disease @entity8 – pronounced ‘ crisper ’ - was used to correct a single ‘ letter ’ of mice ’s genetic alphabet which had been mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism			1
@entity67 researchers were able to cure the rare disease in mice by changing around a third of their liver cells using three guided rna strands			0
the @entity75 strands acted as ‘ guide ’ molecules to find the mutated base pair , known as @entity79			2
the @entity81 enzyme , which was attached to the rna , was then able to repair the fault			0
using this approach , the correct gene was inserted in about one of every 250 hepatocytes — the cells that make up most of the liver			1
over the next 30 days , those healthy cells began to multiply and replace diseased liver cells			0
but its potential was only fully realised two years ago when scientists discovered that it can be combined with a dna - sniping enzyme called @entity96 and used to edit the human genome			2
for this study , scientists at the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) used @entity8 technology to find and correct the mutated dna base pair in a liver gene called @entity103			1
the mutation can lead to a deadly build - up of the amino acid tyrosine in 1 in 100,000 people and has to be treated with drugs and a low - protein diet			0

@entity129 winner professor @entity128 last year described the @entity8 technique as ' a real game - changer ' scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as @entity138 and diseases such as cancer			1
controversially , it might also be used to correct gene defects in human @entity144 embryos , allowing disorders to be ‘ ironed out ’ before a baby is born			1
previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert @entity11 at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process			2
‘ what ’s exciting about this approach is that we can actually correct a defective gene in a living adult animal , ’ said @entity67 ’s @entity149 , the senior author of the paper			1
scientists have developed other gene - editing systems based on dna - slicing enzymes , also known as nucleases , but those complexes can be expensive and difficult to assemble			2
earlier this year two @entity161 monkeys , named @entity162 and @entity163 , became the first genetically - modified primates to be born using a powerful @entity8 technique			1
writing in the journal , @entity166 , the team from @entity167 reported the successful delivery of twin female long - tailed macaques using the technique			0
scientists have previously used the new genome - editing technology to delete , insert , and modify dna in human cells grown in petri dishes			2
ut the new study showed for the first time that @entity8 can create healthy primates with their dna modified at specific targeted genes			2
@entity181 , who led the @entity161 team , said that @entity8 could be used to create monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for animal testing			2
the technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab , and used to test drugs , or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body			0
@entity195 changes in @entity11 are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to @entity138			0
‘ the @entity8 system is very easy to configure and customise , ’ said professor @entity149 , who is also a member of @entity67 ’s @entity198 and @entity199			1
he added that other systems ‘ can potentially be used in a similar way to the @entity8 system , but with those it is much harder to make a nuclease that ’s specific to your target of interest			1
’ last year , @entity129 winner professor @entity128 last night described the new technique as ‘ a real game - changer ’ writing in the @entity211 , he said : ‘ @entity8 is absolutely huge			1
‘ it ’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications , from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans			2
‘ this is really a triumph of basic science			0
it ’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics			0
it ’s a real game - changer			0
‘ it ’s one of those things that you have to see to believe			0
i read the scientific papers like everyone else but when i saw it working in my own lab , my jaw dropped			0
a total novice in my lab got it to work			0

named @entity8 , technique can correct a single ‘ letter ’ of the genetic alphabet
it does this by using enzymes to target specific parts of the dna database
it could treat disorders like sickle - cell anaemia and @entity37 ’s disease
@entity8 might also be used to correct gene defects in human @entity144 embryos , allowing disorders to be ‘ ironed out ’ before a baby is born
