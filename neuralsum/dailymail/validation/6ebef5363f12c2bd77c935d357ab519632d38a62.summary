a passionate tree surgeon created a video to show what his unique , dangerous and perhaps misunderstood job entails			1
capturing footage of himself on a @entity9 camera , @entity5 documented his experiences over a period of several months			1
the video begins with @entity5 , a tree surgeon from @entity14 , sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland			1
suitably prepared , @entity5 ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes – also known as gaffs or spurs – attached to his chainsaw boots			1
what follows is a fast - paced montage sequence showing @entity5 dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes			0
sawing through a particularly large trunk , the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw – while its teeth continue to rotate – and reaching for a wedge			2
@entity5 is filmed sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw before filling it with fuel in a snowy wooded area @entity5 prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top jamming it in the gap , @entity5 makes his way around the tree , systematically tapping the wedge in further as he goes , until the crane is able to lift the top of the trunk away			2
another clip of the tree surgeon shows him drawing a smiley face onto a piece of trunk			2
while the following one presents the three stages in which he safely chops down a rather large tree positioned in the middle of a residential area			0
the tree surgeon uses spikes – also known as gaffs or spurs – attached to his chainsaw boots to help him climb @entity5 demonstrates how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper and shredding it @entity5 also shows off how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper , after cutting down a tree and throwing his chainsaw behind his back to let it hang by its cord			1

before looking into the camera , turning away and demonstrating the trust he has for his tools by resting his chainsaw on his neck			0
quite a height ! @entity5 skillfully chops a tree down in three piece ( left ) and enjoys the view after chopping the top off another tree ( right ) like a knife through butter ! the tree surgeon cuts through a huge trunk with ease while using a wedge to help him tree surgeons , or arborists as they are formally known , cultivate , manage and study individual trees , shrubs and vines			1
their job therefore differs to that of a logger or a forester , who focus on large areas of woodland			0
often dangerous , tree surgeons are sometimes required to work near power wires but may also plan , consult , write reports and give legal testimony			0
in the @entity120 , arborists can gain qualifications up to and including a master 's degree			0
