by @entity0 large oil deposits have been discovered under southern @entity2 which could equal a third of the @entity5 reserves but would need fracking to extract it scientists have discovered potential onshore oil resources in @entity10 , a new report is expected to confirm			1
oil - bearing shale rocks in the @entity13 area spanning parts of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are believed to be as rich in oil as the @entity5 fields			1
the area could hold reserves to equal a third of those under the @entity5 , which would offer @entity25 greater energy security and could help to drive down prices			1
but it would have to be extracted by fracking - the controversial technique which uses high - pressure water to split rocks - and attempts to exploit it risk an angry response from campaigners			1
a report into the ‘ @entity37 ’ reserve has been prepared by the @entity38 and passed to the @entity39 , and could be made public within weeks			0
a similar study in the @entity41 estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas and experts said it could power @entity25 for 50 years			0
the new study also looked for shale gas in the @entity10 , but was reported to have found that oil was the biggest potential resource under the @entity13			1
@entity50 , professor of petroleum exploration at @entity52 , who will advise the @entity39 on the report , told @entity54 : ‘ the discovery of oil in the @entity13 should not be a surprise because there is already a number of small oilfields around the @entity60 and also oil seeps			2
‘ the amount is likely to be less than under the @entity5 , which is a far larger area , and it is not yet possible to be clear about the figures because we do n’t know how much of what is down there			2
but it is clear that these rocks have a high oil content			0
’ large deposits of oil - rich rock have been discovered across @entity17 ( pictured ) , @entity18 , @entity15 and @entity72			1
plans for energy firm @entity74 to sink exploratory wells in an area of outstanding natural beauty near @entity78 , @entity18 , have already prompted legal protests by the @entity80			2
@entity81 faced protests by environmental campaigners when it tried to drill exploratory wells at @entity84 in @entity85			0
campaigners say drilling could scar the countryside , pollute water supplies and clog roads with hundreds of lorries			0
the @entity92 spans traditionally @entity94 areas and the government faces a dilemma between @entity25 ’s energy needs and a community backlash ahead of next year ’s election			0
@entity100 already has @entity102 ’s biggest onshore oil field at @entity103 in @entity104 , where 400million barrels of oil have been extracted since the 1970s .			0

oil - rich rock deposits found in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity15 and @entity16
total reserves could equal a third of @entity5 oil
however extracting it will involve controversial fracking technique
