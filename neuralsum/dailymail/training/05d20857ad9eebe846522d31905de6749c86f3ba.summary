favelas are often associated with @entity1 - the dangerous slums that perch high on the hills around @entity4 and @entity5			0
but @entity6 has its own answer to the favelas of @entity1 - @entity9 - a drug - trafficker 's haven that has become a magnet for tourists			1
around 1,000 tourists a year , including academics , architects and sociologists , are now willing to pay the five euro price for a tour of the slum 's narrow , history - filled streets			1
a tourist stands in front of a @entity25 graffiti in the @entity9 neighborhood of @entity27 a man works at his shop in @entity27 , @entity9 however , taxi drivers still refuse to venture into the what was once one of @entity34 's most dangerous slums after dark			1
inspired by the favela circuits launched in @entity1 in recent years , the visits have a twin goal : ' to clean up the neighbourhood 's image as a drug and crime haven , and give the local economy a boost , ' said @entity45 , who runs the tourism project ' @entity47 '			0
' this is n't @entity49 or @entity51 's gothic quarter , but our cultural heritage can take visitors into the world of @entity56 , its food , crafts and music			1
' a third of residents are made up of @entity56			1
tour guide @entity62 , 27 , explains : ' this is a little village of 7,000 people - everyone knows everyone else			2
' general view of the @entity9 neighborhood of @entity27 during a tourist sightseeing tour @entity9 offers tourists worldwide tours to burnish its image and develop its local economy the first to settle the hill above @entity76 were @entity6 returning from the colonies			1
but after @entity56 's independence in 1975 , they were joined by a mass influx of immigrants who built homes there illegally			2
along with men and women from former colonies @entity87 and @entity89 , they flocked to @entity6 at a time when it was hungry for cheap labour			0
forty years on , with the economic crisis biting hard , @entity9 is plagued with unemployment			1
those who have work struggle as badly paid labourers or cleaners			0
' a lot of young people sell drugs to put food on their families ' tables , ' said @entity62			0
@entity9 is often likened to the favelas of @entity1 and the townships of @entity106 tourists are led by a resident guide of the @entity9 neighbourhood others - armed with @entity6 qualifications - have headed home to @entity56 , even though life there is now twice as expensive as @entity6			1
@entity115 first came to @entity9 from @entity116 in 1982 , as a young psychologist looking for a new experience			2
' i liked the neighbourhood , and i 'm still here , ' she said			0
together with her husband @entity124 , originally from the @entity123 islands , she founded an association called @entity126 - which has been working to improve local living conditions , including fighting for access to running water and sewage			2
the soft - spoken 69 - year - old is on a mission to save @entity9 from demolition			1
' ten years ago , city hall wanted to tear down the neighbourhood and offer the land up to property developers			0
it is very well located , at the gates of @entity76			2
' they organised a campaign of slander on television to get people worked up against us , ' she said			0
tourists and sight - seers come together during the day as the @entity6 community is explored @entity151 ( right ) works as a tour guide , where tourists are charged â‚¬ 5 to enter the @entity6 ' favela ' a tourist ( centre ) leaves a coffee shop during a sightseeing tour of the area tours of the community helps revitalise its image and develop its local economy so from there came the idea of opening up the area to tourists , to show another side of @entity9			1
police raids are frequent by night , but @entity9 is considered safe to visit - with a local guide - after sunrise , and the gangs seem to have reached a tacit decision to leave the tourists alone			1
one dealer even had an abortive go at a new career as a tour guide - before he was sent to jail for driving without a licence			0
judging by the @entity184 tourists ' reaction as they clap and cheer to a local rap video shot to denounce police violence - the pr operation is a success			0
for @entity188 , a pharmacist from @entity189 , the tours ' show you the other side of @entity76 , instead of just visiting the same old monuments			0
' ' exploring @entity9 is more than worthwhile , ' she said .			0
