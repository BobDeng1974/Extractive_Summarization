lengthy tenure : sir @entity1 has hosted @entity2 for 10 years since its inception the show is a saturday night must - see for millions of children			1
but as far as sir @entity1 is concerned , they should remain watching @entity9 ’s @entity8 rather than taking part in it			1
the 85 - year - old tv veteran attacked @entity13 for allowing youngsters to take part in his @entity17 show claiming it is an ‘ ordeal ’ for many of them and results in many of them crying			1
‘ i do n’t think that ’s entertainment , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t think they should put children on that are too young			1
’ sir @entity1 , who plans to return as presenter of @entity2 – the @entity31 ’s rival to another @entity13 show , @entity32 – in the autumn , added : ‘ if you ’re going to do that , have a separate show			1
have a children ’s show , @entity9 children have talent			2
’ yesterday @entity41 , a charity that campaigns for family - friendly media , backed sir @entity1 and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in tv talent shows			1
the criticisms emerged as saturday night ’s instalment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five			1
many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much			2
one young girl in dance troupe @entity57 , comprising 13 five to eight - year - olds , started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round			1
@entity61 , 33 children aged between seven and 14 from @entity63 also took part , with many of them becoming emotional at the end			2
@entity67 teenagers @entity68 , 13 , and @entity69 , 14 , gave an impressive rendition of @entity71 ’s hit @entity72 but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel ’s verdict			2
even @entity13 acknowledged their performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of them on the show , which topped saturday night ’s ratings , attracting more than ten million viewers – three million more than @entity31 rival @entity83			1
we tend to put entertainment on a pedestal in this culture			2
‘ people are so careful about using animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what we expose children to			2
’ scenes of children breaking down in tears have become all too common on @entity109 , with sir @entity1 recalling how one girl of 11 was left in tears			1
a spokesman for the show said : ' the welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our programmes			0
' children are accompanied by a member of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on hand at all auditions			0
' we also employ registered chaperones at our judges ’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children ’s welfare			0
' as there are a limited number of performances @entity9 ’s @entity8 does not have an age limit			0
' all too much : a young contestant in tears on saturday night 's show feeling the pressure : dance troupe @entity57 looked nervous hundreds of viewers complained in 2009 when two child singers , @entity89 and @entity85 , cried due to the pressure of performing live			1
and last year @entity9 ’s @entity8 had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine - year - old @entity150 broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of nerves			0
last month child welfare campaigners questioned whether five - year - old @entity155 should have been put through to the next round			0
while the youngster , from @entity159 , received positive comments from the judges , there were concerns that he is too young to cope with fame , should he progress to the final stages of the competition			2
@entity155 , dressed in a black baseball cap and a t - shirt with his name on it , performed an impressive dance routine and was given a ‘ yes ’ by all four judges			0
questionable taste : @entity13 ( right ) kissing @entity173 during this weekend 's show but viewers called the decision ‘ inappropriate ’ and called on @entity17 to bring in new rules to ‘ stop this happening ’			1
saturday ’s @entity109 also provoked outrage over sexual references on the pre-watershed show			0
@entity181 , a 71 - year - old grandmother , performed a song called @entity183 * * containing the lyrics : ‘ ‘ i came home a little early , i could n’t believe my eyes , you were lying there butt naked with a woman between your thighs			0
’ tv watchdog @entity191 attacked @entity192 and @entity17 for screening the performance following criticism of a lap dancer earlier in the series			0
@entity191 - @entity9 director @entity197 has asked the government ’s child protection tsar @entity200 to investigate sexualised content on shows aired before the 9pm watershed			0
she said : ‘ the ratings are falling and @entity17 is just pulling out the stops			0
first we had the lap dancer @entity207 and now this granny			0
@entity109 is going all out to shock and @entity192 is simply under - regulating the show '			0

sir @entity1 said @entity13 should *launch* a ' @entity213 '
on young , crying performers : ' i do *n't* think that 's entertainment . '
