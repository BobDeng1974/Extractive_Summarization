by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 27 march 2012 when @entity3 's new @entity2 tells you that it has 100 % battery , it is n't always telling the truth			1
the gadget starts to say that it is ' full ' when it 's at 90 % - a difference that can cost users 1.2 hours ' usage			1
the reason , says @entity11 , is that the formula used to calculate when the device is ' full ' is slightly out - a safety mechanism used by @entity3 to prevent people overcharging their gadgets			0
the battery in the new @entity2 is 1.7 times bigger than the one in @entity2 - and the difference means the new gadget misreports whether it is fully charged or not all iphones , @entity22 and @entity23 misreport whether they are full - albeit at a slightly higher level around 97 % , @entity11 claims			1
but with the new @entity2 's enormous battery capacity - 1.7 times bigger than @entity2 - the slight difference in the formula used to calculate when it is ' full ' makes a noticeable difference to the battery life			1
@entity31 of monitoring firm @entity32 says that the difference is measurable on the new @entity2			0
the display gives a claimed battery life of 10.4 hours , whereas the real figure is 11.6 hours - and the difference can leave users thinking the device is fully charged when in fact it 's not			0
@entity31 also claims that users who attempt to charge new ipad while using it could be in for a surprise - it can take up to 20 hours			0
@entity3 's @entity2 uses a much larger amount of power than its predecessor , largely due to the demands of its @entity51 screen the problem should be easily fixable via a software download - often used by @entity3 to fix battery glitches and other teething difficulties with gadgets			2
his measurements lend weight to earlier complaints on @entity3 forums that the device has shorter battery life and painfully long charging times			0
@entity32 claims that the huge increase in power demands is due to the density of pixels on the new screen			2
the @entity71 backlight needs a huge amount of power just to shine through the high density of transistors in the panels			0
‘ the power consumption of the @entity71 is 2.5 times that of @entity2 , and the battery is 1.7 times larger - if you run your new @entity2 at full brightness , the battery run time is less because you only put in 70 percent more battery but you 're using 150 percent more power , ’ @entity77 of @entity78 said in an interview with @entity80 .			1
