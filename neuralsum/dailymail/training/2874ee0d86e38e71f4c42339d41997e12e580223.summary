by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 10 june 2013 it stood tall over the city 's skyline for 27 years			1
but it took only seconds for the two towers of the @entity7 to be reduced to rubble			1
the five star hotel , one of the oldest in its province , was considered elderly by modern standards and was ordered to make way for a younger model			1
it was demolished this morning before rush hour in a controlled explosion so it would not damage neighbouring buildings in @entity21 in @entity24 's eastern @entity23 province			1
the detonation of the explosives was planned to beat the rush hour traffic , happening between 5am and 6am today			0
a five foot - wide trench dug six feet deep reduced the impact of shockwaves from the blast , according to @entity50			2
explosives were carefully positioned around the building made sure the towers collapsed on themselves , keeping things as neat as possible			2
the hotel had more than 600 rooms overlooking the sea before its closure and had last been renovated in 2003 , according to @entity59			2
guests could play tennis on the hotel 's own courts or swim in its pool before enjoying massages and spa facilities			1
they could choose from @entity24 , @entity70 , @entity71 or @entity72 cuisine , the site said			1
the towers stood 26 and 14 storeys high respectively over @entity21 in @entity23 province , eastern @entity24 the demolition of the hotel buildings has left a gap in the @entity21 skyline but they will soon be replaced by new developments when it 's not possible to knock a tall building over into an empty space , explosives experts have to plot devices at specific points around the building to make sure it collapses into its own footprint			1
the blasts on the building 's support structure make levels crash down on top of each other			2
planting explosives at some of the higher levels helps the building to break into smaller pieces on its way down			0
this leaves a pile of rubble , which is easier to clear away			0
often , the workers will ensure the internal support columns are destroyed first , so the outside walls fall into the centre and minimise damage to surrounding buildings			0
to prepare for the blast , walls that do n't bear a load are usually removed			0
sometimes workers may try to make support walls weaker by hitting them with sledgehammers			0
dynamite stuffed into holes takes care of concrete , while steel structures need an explosive called @entity121 , which explodes at up to 27,000ft per second , according to @entity122			0
once a safety cordon is in place , it 's time to detonate , where all that preparation results in blasters needing only seconds to bring the building down			1
a team of explosive experts planned the blast so that other buildings in the area would not be affected dirt and dust from the explosion clouded over the site , where traffic measures kept people away for safety			0

the five star @entity7 in @entity21 , eastern @entity24 , was reduced to rubble in seconds this morning
hotel 's two towers , at 26 and ten storeys , were built in the *1980s* , making it one of the oldest in @entity23 province
