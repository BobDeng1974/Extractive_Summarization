by @entity0 last updated at 1:00 am on 29th october 2011 colonel @entity2 ’s fugitive son @entity2 is trying to reach a safe haven in @entity4 while also negotiating to surrender , officials said yesterday			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) in the @entity7 confirmed it was in ‘ indirect ’ talks with the @entity10 - educated playboy			1
@entity2 , 39 - who was @entity2 ’s heir apparent - has been indicted for war crimes and is on the run in the @entity15 desert			1
he has laid down conditions for handing himself in for trial , including being found a safe country to live in if he is acquitted or after serving a prison sentence			1
but double - dealing @entity2 is also in talks with mercenaries willing to find him a safe haven under the protection of another @entity26 despot such as @entity27 in @entity4			1
‘ we are having informal conversations with @entity2 in order to see if he can be surrendered to the court , ’ @entity28 , chief prosecutor of the @entity6 , said in @entity29 yesterday			1
remarkable turnaround : @entity36 gather at a market today in the grounds of the @entity40 compound , formerly the hq of ousted leader @entity42 but he said @entity2 was also trying to reach a country that did not cooperate with handing over suspects to the @entity6			2
‘ we know he has a different option , because apparently there is a group of mercenaries willing to move him to a country , probably @entity4 , ’ the prosecutor said			2
some of the mercenaries may be from @entity53 , he said			2
he said the court was urging other countries to prevent @entity2 ’s escape by denying any plane carrying him permission to fly through their air space			1
will he put his hands up ? @entity2 went on tv in august ( above ) to declare he would not surrender			2
he is wanted on charges of inciting crowds to murder during the early stages of the @entity36 revolution he said @entity2 – who would use any trial to grandstand about his relationships with @entity72 leaders such as @entity73 and @entity74 – was making all sorts of demands			0
successful mission : @entity78 says it will be able to quickly wind down operations in @entity36 since the death of @entity2 's father @entity42 he was pressing for clarifications about his fate should he be acquitted , said mr @entity28 , who said he has made it clear to the fugitive that he could ask the judges to send him to a country other than @entity36			1
‘ he says he is innocent and he will prove his innocence , ’ said the prosecutor			0
@entity2 is deep in the desert , believed to have crossed from @entity36 to @entity91 with escorts from @entity94 herdsmen			0
@entity91 has said it would hand him over to the @entity6 , so @entity2 is unlikely to stay there long			0
his co-fugitive , @entity36 ’s former intelligence chief @entity96 , made the same journey a day earlier and ended up in eastern @entity98 , near @entity99			0
but @entity98 ’s foreign minister @entity100 said yesterday : ‘ @entity98 will respect its obligations in relation to the @entity6			0
we are absolutely clear on that			0
’ in @entity36 , new justice minister @entity105 told the @entity106 last night : ‘ if @entity2 is captured in @entity36 , he will be tried in @entity36			0

@entity78 says it will end air strikes on *monday*
@entity110 ' one of the most successful in *history* ' , says *secretary* - general
