to hear @entity0 tell it , the intervention staged by @entity4 boss @entity3 and assistant @entity5 was definitely closer to a kick in the what - nots than it was a pat on the back			1
whatever the detail of the conversation , and however lasting the effects may be , the short - term impact on the 24 - year - old force of nature — often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind — has been nothing short of remarkable			1
as the kid himself puts it : ‘ being top scorer now means that , since i have had a talk with the manager , i have knuckled down and proved him wrong , proved @entity22 wrong and shown that i deserve to be here			2
’ hat - trick hero @entity0 with signed match ball and man of the match award rather revealing , is n’t it ? clearly demanding @entity3 and original gym rat @entity5 did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent , wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade @entity0 that the carrot was n’t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes			1
‘ i had to improve , ’ admits the former @entity38 star			2
‘ i was n’t playing at the start of the season			2
i had a talk with the manager and @entity5 about everything and about what they wanted me to do			1
‘ thankfully , in the two months since the turn of the year , i have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now			0
‘ what did they say to me ? i had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up			0
i did that and i have been bang on form since the turn of the year			1
‘ when i was at @entity38 , i would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals i scored			1
‘ but coming here , it ’s a massive club and , with the new manager coming into the club , he wanted to impose his own philosophy			2
‘ playing one up front , you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards			0
since january , though , my fitness levels have been good and i have been scoring goals			0
‘ i was brought to @entity4 to score goals and i ’ve started to do that since the turn of the year			1
i have n’t set any new targets — but i do want a good run of games			0
‘ i want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as i possibly can			0
@entity4 's @entity0 ( right ) completes his hat - trick against @entity79 ‘ the manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench			1
‘ @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 were all on the bench against @entity79			1
’ @entity0 is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals , his hat - trick in wednesday night ’s 4 - 1 home win over @entity79 definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the @entity98 game has seen this season			1
his second treble haul in @entity4 colours took his total for the season to 15 goals , the majority of those coming in 2015 , as he has contended more frequently with @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity88 for the lone striker ’s role favoured — for now , at least — by @entity3			1
watching @entity107 amble around aimlessly until @entity0 arrived to partner the big @entity112 on wednesday night , it definitely seems as though @entity3 has only two options for sunday ’s @entity114 semi-final against @entity116			1
either he plays both in a traditional front - pairing			2
or he lets @entity0 , scorer of an early opener against @entity116 in the @entity119 last weekend , loose on his own at @entity120			1
if his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 striker from the starting @entity127 , his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour			2
substitute @entity0 came off the bench to spark @entity4 into life after lacklustre first - half the extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease @entity38 past @entity138 4 - 3 at this stage of the @entity114 two years ago , @entity0 also opened the scoring for @entity4 against @entity141 in the @entity143 semi earlier this season			1
‘ i ’ve played in two semi-finals at @entity120 and i have won two , ’ he points out			0
‘ hopefully , i can continue that			0
‘ i ’ll be looking to score again			0
but the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the @entity151			0
‘ @entity116 will come down and make it difficult for us			0
they proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat			0
‘ every game against them this season has been tight and i expect the same again on sunday			0
’ if @entity0 starts and plays as he did against @entity79 , even @entity116 at their most obdurate will struggle to cope			1
his hat - trick — one perfectly placed header , one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish — was a timely reminder of what he can do , when the mood is upon him			2
@entity4 manager @entity3 ( left ) congratulates @entity0 after the final whistle ‘ it was n’t a bad night ’s work , ’ he says with a smile			1
‘ it was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at @entity116 last weekend			0
and we had suffered a setback , going 1 - 0 down to @entity79 , although the boys fought back in the right way			1
‘ all of the goals were my favourites			0
the first one was a great ball into the box by @entity181 and i managed to head it down into the net			0
‘ the second one went in off the post and i was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third			0
thankfully , it did n’t come and i fired it back across the goalkeeper			0
‘ it ’s only my third hat - trick in senior football , so it ’s decent			2
my second one came for @entity4 against @entity116 last year			1
’ cute move , dropping that into conversation			2
take note , gaffer ? not only am i bang in form , not only do i have a great record at @entity120 , but i ’ve shown i can do the business against @entity116			2
@entity4 start as favourites on sunday and , with @entity38 also edging the odds in their semi against @entity138 , @entity205 could spend may 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team			1
asked outright if he would like to face @entity38 , balancing up the desire to become a treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of @entity114 taunts , @entity0 admitted : ‘ honest answer , no ! ‘ if they get there , it will be great for the club , but i ’m just concentrating on doing my job for @entity4			1
we are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and , obviously , we want to go for the @entity229			0
‘ there is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up			0
at the moment , @entity116 are standing in our way of having a potentially great season			0

@entity0 revealed that @entity3 and @entity5 warned him
the @entity4 striker took a while to settle in at his new club after his move
@entity0 has been in red - *hot* form and scored three against @entity79
