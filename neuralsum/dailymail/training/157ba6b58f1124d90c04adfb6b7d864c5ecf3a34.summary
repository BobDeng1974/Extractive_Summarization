sir @entity41 , who represents @entity42 and @entity43 , accused ministers of ‘ exploiting commuters ’ and using rail fares as ‘ a disguised form of taxation ’ since the extra 2 per cent goes straight into the @entity10 ’s coffers			0
open revolt : @entity5 mps including @entity52 , right , and even @entity5 deputy chairman @entity53 , left , are demanding the @entity10 acts to soften the blow of rising rail fares @entity56 mp @entity52 called on ministers to ‘ do more ’ to get a better deal for travellers			1

miss @entity73 said : ‘ it would be quite wrong for the @entity95 to take away the green belt from the next generation			0
’ fellow @entity5 @entity97 , who has campaigned to protect the green belt in his @entity100 constituency , said : ‘ we have a duty of trust to protect greenbelt land for future generations			2
