it 's that time of year when many of us realise just how frail our elderly relatives have become - and , in turn , fear for their safety			1
now , a new wristband promises to ease the fears of family members - and gives the wearer more confidence about their wellbeing			1
@entity13 , as it is known , works as a 24/7 monitoring and personal emergency response service			1
it not only tracks the user 's whereabouts using gps , but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble			1
the @entity26 system not only tracks the user 's whereabouts using @entity28 , but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble			1
it comes in three parts - the wristband , the clip ( left , which can be attached to a lanyard or keyring ) and the dock ( centre )			0
while the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user , tracing movement and raising an alert if it detects a fall , the clip remains in the charging dock , plugged in at home , and ' talks ' to the wristband unlike traditional ' around the neck ' alert devices , @entity13 works outside the house and even abroad the aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind			1

while the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user , and and traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall , the clip goes in a pocket or handbag and ' talks ' to the wristband			1
the dock provides accurate indoor location point , charges the devices and communicates wirelessly with them , displaying clip and wristband battery charge levels			0
there is also an alert button , allowing the wearer to contact and speak to the 24/7 alarm - monitoring centre in case of an emergency , via a portable clip			1
safe areas can be created for the wearer which alert carers , friends or family members if broken			1
and unlike many personal alarms which are taken off at night , by wearing the wristband at night - when many falls happen on the way to the bathroom - users are better protected , knowing that a fall will be alerted			1
according to research by the @entity100 charity , more 20 per cent of people aged over 75 fear falling			0
and of these , 5 per cent are so fearful that they will not leave their homes unaccompanied , the report found			0
a third of them had suffered falls in recent years and a fifth of these said they had lost confidence as a result			0
many said they were especially worried during winter months			0
the aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind			1
assigned relatives can log on and see an activity log , for example the wristband goes everywhere with the user			1
it traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall every year in the @entity127 nearly three - quarters of a million people aged over 60 end up in the local @entity130 department after a fall , and one in three of these will end up staying in hospital because of their injuries			1
figures show around a third of adults who are over 65 and living at home will experience at least one fall a year			0
this rises to half of adults over 80 who are either at home or in residential care			0
in 2009 in @entity145 and @entity146 , there were more than 3,500 deaths as a result of falls			0
with the @entity153 wristband , an individual ’s personal settings can be configured via the buddi website through a secure user login area			1
if the wearer presses the alert buttons for help , or if the system detects the person has fallen , the 24 hour monitoring service can find information about their location , talk to them through the clip to establish the kind of assistance they require , and notify emergency contacts			1
if the wearer can not be reached - perhaps because they are unconscious or because they ca n't physically reach the clip - the monitoring team will try to alert other registered emergency contacts			1
@entity177 are detected automatically , so even if someone is incapacitated as a result of a fall , the system still works without having to be activated by hand			0
the wristband also monitors activity levels - and with the option of setting expected activity level , flags up if a person is moving more or less than normal the graphs - made from a movement log - help you to identify sleep patterns and monitor restless sleep and nighttime activity a sensor called an accelerometer inside the wristband measures the changes in movement that result from a fall			2

' the idea is that no one need ever be alone , ' founder @entity207 told @entity210			0
' it helps relieve the burden on ordinary families , who are often caught in a balancing act between allowing their parents or grandparents to retain their independence by being on hand , but then losing their own independence in the process			2
' ms @entity207 , a technology entrepreneur , created @entity13 in 2005 after the horror she felt when her young daughter temporarily disappeared at a supermarket			1
she was recently named @entity224 by @entity225 – and @entity13 was the only @entity127 - based business on this year ’s ten - strong list of companies			1
ms @entity207 added : ' at @entity153 , we operate a fully staffed emergency monitoring centre in the @entity127 where trained operators are on hand 24/7 , 365 days of the year , to react to emergency alerts and inform registered contacts of emergencies so that they can provide assistance			1
just last week , @entity13 won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to a @entity239 company ' the technology used in the new @entity153 can also be used to remotely monitor a person 's general welfare , enabling care to be delivered to a much larger number of people at no extra cost to the tax - payer			1
' @entity13 is currently working with over 100 @entity127 local authorities and @entity249 to help protect vulnerable people from harm			1
according to a cost - benefit analysis completed by the economist @entity254 , @entity26 's technology could save the government £ 2bn			2
this is because its technology , on average , delays the need for residential care – which costs about £ 60,000 a year for each patient – by about nine months			0
and just last week @entity13 won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to @entity265 - @entity264 , a @entity239 company which provides technology - based health management solutions for individuals and institutions			1
the deal will see the distribution of the wristband device across @entity239 , which will help senior and vulnerable people remain independent for longer , the company says			0
prices are either £ 249 to purchase the equipment and £ 5 a week for 24 - 7 ( for fully staffed emergency support for any alert , ) or £ 10 a week to lease the same service			1
