@entity2 football 's relationship with television has become a form of @entity5			1
no one is tied up in a basement			0
yet the lengths to which the @entity11 will go to show love to those broadcasters who hold a gun to their heads has become a source of growing , simmering public fury			0
the @entity2 game is engaged in a faustian pact			1
and the television piper is calling the tune			0
@entity23 and @entity24 sports pay £ 16million a year for live coverage of @entity2 football			1
the @entity27 puts in an estimated £ 3m a year for @entity29 highlights and radio commentaries			0
@entity32 striker @entity31 ( right ) completes his hat - trick during the win over @entity35 earlier this week compared with the £ 5billion paid to @entity37 clubs for @entity39 football the sums are trifling			1
@entity42 facing @entity43 on a wet march night in @entity44 will never be a rival to the @entity47 derby but broadcasters do n't show @entity2 football out of charity			1
they do so because it fills their schedules and meets a level of demand			1
in return for which they regard @entity11 football with indifference			1
the @entity27 , a state public service broadcaster , charges the same flat rate licence tax to viewers in @entity63 and @entity47 as it does to viewers in @entity65 and @entity66 , with one key difference			0
@entity37 football is treated with reverence and respect			1
@entity2 football like a pavement beggar			1
on saturday , @entity74 and @entity75 fans will be asked to travel to @entity65 for a @entity76 semi-final which kicks off at 12.15pm why ? because @entity78 want the game out of the way to show a recorded documentary on @entity82			0
on sunday , @entity66 fans must travel 200 miles for another 12.15pm kick - off against @entity32			1
topping the bill in the afternoon is the @entity87 rugby semi-final between @entity88 and @entity89 , a game likely to prompt complete indifference in public houses the length and breadth of @entity95			0
it 's not just the @entity76			1
@entity32 have played just four home league games at 3pm on a saturday all season			0
and the decision to put back the @entity102 clash 24 hours for the benefit of @entity23 caused an almighty row while resurrecting the dreaded ' sporting integrity ' phrase			1
@entity74 are engaged in a battle with the @entity109 side for second place in the @entity102			0
this matters because the team which finishes second has two fewer tense , troublesome play - off games to play			1
were @entity114 to go into their final game at @entity116 needing only a point against @entity102 — @entity74 's city rivals — the game would be played against an unparalleled backdrop of suspicion			1
to most — @entity122 of @entity74 and @entity102 owner @entity123 especially — the issue is one of fairness			0
the games should always have kicked off at the same time and they believe the @entity11 have been duplicitous and deceitful			1
loathe to be seen criticising the @entity11 , @entity129 chief executive @entity128 chose his words carefully , while all but admitting the league had made a complete and utter hash of things			0
@entity135 's @entity134 ( right ) challenges @entity137 's @entity136 ( left ) during the @entity139 match ' for 99 per cent of the time , there are no issues , ' he said			1
' broadcasting in football has been operating for 20 - 30 years with big money coming into the game			1
usually it 's no problem at all			2
' there are times — and we have one right now — where the broadcaster has a requirement to show a match at a particular time on a particular day and that causes issues			2
' it 's important for the league to consult with all of the interested parties , particularly the clubs who are the connecting point with the fans			2
' obviously , you ca n't please everybody but consultation is the secret			0
@entity167 ( @entity11 chief ) has been challenged by a number of different parties and i think it 's important he listens and tries to come up with a pragmatic solution			2
' minutes after @entity128 spoke , the @entity11 's solution arrived in the shape of an embarrassing u-turn			2
as they should have been from the outset , the final - day championship games were all rearranged for saturday may 2			2
with a 12.15pm kick - off , naturally			2
and after some cap doffing and bowing to the @entity23 paymasters			1
most accept @entity181 is the paid hand of the most influential clubs in @entity129 , with little real executive authority			0
his job is to act as a human shield for clubs and to put lipstick on a pig of a broadcasting deal			0
yet the decision to put the @entity114 fixture back heightened suspicions over both his competence and motives			0
in may 2013 , the final game in @entity199 for the @entity109 club — against @entity114 — was shown live on television			0
the other four fixtures were immediately brought forward , too			0
a statement on the @entity114 website confirmed the decision had been taken ' in the interests of fairness '			0
what changed between may 2013 and now ? to those who believe the @entity11 are hellbent on getting @entity114 back into the top tier come what may , this was manna from heaven			0
' it 's a challenging time for the @entity11 right now , ' said @entity128 with a degree of understatement			1
' i can see why fans are unhappy			0
' ultimately there 's always a balance between the needs of the broadcasters and the needs of the clubs , the needs of the supporters and sponsors			2
' when you 're looking at a @entity2 football landscape , where money is tight and a broadcaster is the biggest provider of income , that ca n't be ignored			1
i 'm not saying it 's right but they have to be heard			2
' the problem comes when paying customers believe the broadcasters are the only people being heard			0
@entity42 's @entity241 ( centre ) is challenged by @entity43 's @entity243 ( right ) @entity2 fans from across the @entity95 are now routinely asked , at the drop of a hat , to change travel plans to facilitate friday - night football and noon kick - offs on a saturday or sunday			1
monday night games have also crept onto the schedules			2
and for what ? @entity2 viewers make up around nine per cent of @entity23 and @entity254 ' s subscribers			1
yet it now costs them more to cover two games between @entity258 and @entity259 than it does to fund an entire season of @entity2 football			1
the @entity27 , meanwhile , pays @entity263 as much to present @entity264 as they do for @entity11 highlights and radio coverage			2
' it 's fair to say that the landscape we are in right now is challenging , ' added @entity128			2
' when you look at the numbers that the @entity39 delivered in @entity37 it blows everything out of the water			1
' the @entity2 football authorities — the league in particular — are fighting for what you would call the scraps from the table			1
' i know that there is pressure being put on the @entity27 through a number of parties right now , including the @entity286 , to try to see if there is any way to make an improvement in income that can be generated by further discussions			0
' but , ultimately , the broadcaster will only pay market rate for the product they are buying			0
' we are trying to get that market rate back up by collectively working on initiatives to improve our game , but it 's not going to happen overnight			2
' the empty stands are a problem			0
the spectacle in the @entity11 is often poor and does nothing to persuade @entity23 that @entity2 football is worth paying out more cash			1
in a vicious circle , however , this attitude drives the crowds lower and lower			0
many now speak openly , then , of @entity2 football going cold turkey			1
of subscriber boycotts or ending the abusive relationship with broadcasters altogether and streaming @entity11 games online on a pay - per - view basis			2
or having no coverage at all			0
when old hands of the @entity2 game such as sir @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity322 warned of the creeping dangers of live television they were dismissed as dinosaurs			1
right now , they look like visionaries			0
@entity32 fans sing during the win over @entity35 , which sees them three points clear at the top of the @entity139			0

@entity2 football coverage is at the mercy of @entity23 and @entity24 's schedules
yet , @entity2 football is never afforded the same *precedence* as @entity37 's
the demand for @entity2 football is *nearing* an all - time low
