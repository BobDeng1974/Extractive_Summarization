by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:14 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 14 december 2013 @entity3 and @entity4 better get used to laughing at themselves as @entity6 will have at least one black female cast member by january to play both of them			1
rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started yesterday , when @entity13 reported that auditions were held earlier this month at the @entity16 theater for black female comediennes in @entity18 , following criticism that the show lacked diversity			1
the rumor was confirmed by @entity6 's creater and producer @entity24 who told the @entity26 yesterday that a black female cast member will join the cast in january - the first time @entity24 can remember adding a cast member mid-season			1
man behind the curtain : @entity24 previously said that hiring a black actress was on the show 's to do list ' @entity51 told we 've seen about 25 people , ' @entity24 told the @entity26			1
' a lot of people we saw are really good			0
hopefully we 'll come out of the process well			0
' @entity24 added that as many as two of the nine that made it to the final round could make it onto the cast in january			1
but he says he does n't want to add too many women since the cast already has five			2
right now , the snl cast consists of five men and five women , with one female and six male featured players			1
@entity24 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall			1
he saw the two women during a performance in @entity74 , but their performances were n't as strong when they were invited to @entity44 for the final auditions			1
' then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized , it looks a different way , ' he said			0
that 's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season			0
@entity24 says he ca n't remember ever adding a cew cast member in the middle of the season , but says he has added players in march or april to get them into the last episodes of the season			1
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity6 has hired just four black women			1
the first was @entity94 , right , and @entity95 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity99 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity102 in 2000			1
@entity103 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since while many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity111 , @entity24 says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision			1
' that 's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you do n't judge comedy that way			0
versatility is what we look for			0
' this will be the first time since 2007 that @entity6 has had a woman of @entity128 - @entity127 heritage on the show			1
the two current black cast members - @entity131 and @entity132 - were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag			1
laughing at themselves : when @entity142 @entity141 hosted the show last month , the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having @entity141 play @entity3 and @entity111 in the same skit done : cast member @entity131 announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women			1
he had played the likes of @entity155 ( right ) , @entity156 and @entity157 in the past as a result , there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring first lady @entity3 since @entity102 left the cast in 2007			2
the only exception to this came in november when @entity166 star @entity165 was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played mrs @entity3 , @entity111 and @entity4 in the same sketch as the show 's way of poking fun at themselves			2
' snl ' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975 , including @entity103 who is biracial			2
' it 's not like it 's not a priority for us , ' @entity24 said in an interview with the @entity179 in early november			2
i 'm sure it will happen			0
' news of the invitation - only auditions that have been taking place in @entity18 and @entity74 broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet			2
actress @entity189 said she was ' honored ' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance			1
' it was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but , if you stay ready you ai n't got ta get ready and we were ready ! , ' she told @entity196			0
' i can share that we all entered the @entity16 theater backstage having no idea what to expect			0
i had no clue who was apart of the showcase			0
of course my comedienne friends ( @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 ) were there			0
and some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that i had never met , ' she said			0
@entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 also auditioned according to @entity218			0
' we were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness , ' ms @entity189 said			0
' we were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot			2
we even held hands prayed after the showcase			0
the show was also sold out			0
it was packed to the max. ' @entity234 says she was invited to audition last summer , but was filming a television show and was n't able to perform			2
one of the comediennes - @entity215 - has a fan on the inside , as @entity132 has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots			1
supporter : cast member @entity132 ( left ) has specifically named @entity244 ( right ) as someone he hopes joins the cast ' why do i think she should be on the show ? because she 's black first of all , and she 's really talented			1
she needs to be on @entity6			2
and i believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year , ' @entity132 told @entity255			0
the timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to several high - profile departures			0
@entity261 is expected to leave the show mid-way through this season to replace @entity264 as the host of @entity266 and @entity267 has confirmed that he will not be returning next season .			0
