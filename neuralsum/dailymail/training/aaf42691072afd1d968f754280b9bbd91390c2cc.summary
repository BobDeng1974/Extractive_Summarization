by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:53 pm on 25th october 2011 a @entity3 holidaymaker has been slapped with a £ 4,000 bill for internet roaming charges after returning from a trip to @entity7			1
@entity8 , 30 , was charged £ 4,180.83 despite buying a £ 6 internet bundle deal prior to his two - week trip to the @entity11			1
mr @entity8 said @entity12 had assured him the bundle would cover roaming charges and enable him to access the internet while abroad			1
but when he returned home after the trip he found the company had billed him 80 times his usual £ 50 monthly tariff			0
shocked : @entity20 on holiday in @entity7			0
he returned home to a mobile phone bill of more than £ 4,000 despite being assured by @entity12 that his £ 6 bundle would cover him for roaming charges @entity26 : the £ 4,182 bill that @entity12 sent mr @entity20			1
the company has offered to reduce the bill to £ 500 , which he has reluctantly agreed to pay mr @entity8 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , thought that the £ 6 fee would cover his charges for the duration of his trip			1
he said : ' i was sold this £ 6 deal under the impression that i would n't be charged extortionate prices for using my phone abroad			1
' i specifically phoned @entity12 and told them that i wanted to use the internet abroad and they told me that this " bundle " deal , as they call it , would be my best bet			1
' when i saw the bill for more than four grand , i was gobsmacked			0
' mr @entity8 , a coordinator at a private care company , set out to the @entity7 on september 24 with his friend @entity50 , 31			0
they spent four nights in @entity53 , four nights in @entity55 and six nights in @entity57 , using the internet regularly but making only one mobile phone call to the @entity3			2
after listening to the recording of his call to the company , @entity12 has now admitted that he has been falsely sold the deal			2
the telecoms giant originally offered mr @entity8 £ 100 towards the bill as a goodwill gesture while insisting he must pay the remainder of the charges and settle his account			0
post-holiday blues : mr @entity20 , left , travelled to the @entity7 with friend @entity71 , and visited @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity57			0
he used the internet regularly while abroad but made only one call to the @entity3 mr @entity8 refused the £ 100 off offer and @entity12 increased the reduction in the bill by £ 1400			1
after he refused to pay the reduced bill of £ 2,980.83 @entity12 finally conceded that he must pay £ 500 , which he reluctantly accepted			1
he said : ' i feel forced to accept their offer because i have no other choice really			0
' the fact that @entity12 offered me £ 100 to begin with , and expected me to be grateful , is beyond a joke			2
' i should n't have to pay out that kind of money when i was led to believe that purchasing a £ 6 internet bundle deal would cover me against these ridiculous charges			1
' a spokesman for @entity12 said : ' we advise customers to call customer services before travelling abroad to find out about the charges and services available			2
' in the case of mr @entity8 , we discussed the customer 's expected data usage in advance of his travel and provided bundle advice			0
' @entity12 is committed to giving customers transparency when it comes to our roaming rates to ensure they are aware of the different charges when they go abroad			2
' we have a number of initiatives in place to help customers control their costs and we hope that these , as well as the customer 's own individual responsibility , will ensure customers can manage their roaming costs appropriately			0
' we look at all customer complaints on a case - by - case basis and can confirm we have offered mr @entity20 a resolution which he is happy with			0

he thought £ 6 would cover two weeks internet and mobile use while *stateside*
@entity12 admit *mistake* but still insist on a reduced payment of £ 500
