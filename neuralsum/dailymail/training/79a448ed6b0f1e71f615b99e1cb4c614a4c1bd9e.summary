emails expose officials ’ delight that rising numbers of traffic fines are being issued , with one saying : ‘ another record month , guys			1
’ hundreds of the documents were released to a motoring campaigner under the @entity24 and will be screened tonight in an investigation by @entity27 ’s @entity26			1
they show how surveillance cameras are catching out cars performing u-turns and being stuck in box junctions as part of a ‘ target - based , revenue - raising culture ’			2
the programme highlights @entity37 ’s most notorious yellow box junction , which has been dubbed ‘ the money box ’ for raking in £ 2.7million a year by trapping and photographing up to 40,000 drivers before sending them a £ 130 fine in the post			1
motoring groups say such tactics ‘ verge on entrapment ’ and fear they will spread across @entity37			0
the programme obtained hundreds of emails between employees at the @entity49 of @entity50 & @entity51 which show staff being congratulated on increasing the number of fines			1
among the comments in the emails are : ‘ another record month , guys			2
well done ’ ; ‘ another increase ... holidays , as expected , bring back the traffic ’ ; ‘ another good month last month			0
that ’s despite the systems problems we had			0
so well done to everyone			0
’ a note to the head of parking services about the council ’s procurement of specialist ‘ close circuit tv equipment ’ says : ‘ aim of project : to increase parking revenue ( target : additional £ 5m			2
) ’ the council said the email was from a management trainee temporarily seconded to the council and ‘ wrongly ’ suggested the aim was to raise revenue			0

big business : councils are using @entity89 to catch motorists performing u-turns and getting stuck in box junctions to raise revenue one notes : ‘ a worrying start as @entity95 seemed to reduce			2
’ another adds : ‘ we may get a negative hit on the u-turn tickets for this month			0
’ @entity26 says the council is ‘ exploiting a sophisticated new camera system to fine motorists for moving traffic offences , such as stopping in a yellow box junction or making a banned turn ’			1
no cash cow : @entity50 and @entity106 has denied issuing tickets to raise money critics say the ‘ money box ’ junction , controlled by traffic lights at the @entity113 ’s @entity112 , is badly signed and designed			1
only four spaces are available for cars leaving the junction , so drivers can easily get trapped in the box and fined £ 130			1
researchers who put up clearer warning signs at the junction recorded a 25 per cent fall in cars getting stuck – before being told by the council to remove the signs			2
the council has spent £ 500,000 installing a round - the - clock camera system called @entity126 which spots errant motorists automatically			0
