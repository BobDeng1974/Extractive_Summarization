they are the undisputed predators of the ocean , armed with razor - sharp teeth , capable of reaching speeds of 35mph - and now a great white shark could be headed towards @entity5			1
a ferocious predator - called @entity6 - is currently just 1,000 miles of the coast of @entity9 and @entity10 in the @entity11			1
and if she continues on her path , the 14.5ft , 2,000lb beast could arrive in @entity5 waters by monday , which would make her the first great white to cross the @entity11			1
she was tagged as part of the @entity19 project , which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements and @entity6 ’s progress can be followed on the project ’s website			1
she is currently near the @entity40 and researchers tracking her progress said she has travelled 380miles in just 72 hours			1
' she technically does not cross the @entity11 until she crosses the @entity40 ridge , which she has yet to do , ’ said dr @entity44 , senior fisheries biologist with @entity45			1
he believes she is closer to @entity46 than @entity47			0
@entity6 has swum 380 - miles in just 72 hours and is currently near the @entity40 ( marked )			1
if she swims over the @entity40 range then she will be the first recorded great white to cross the @entity11 the shark has travelled more than 19,000 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near @entity37 as part of the @entity19 scientific project in transit : @entity6 is currently near the @entity40 - dr @entity44 says she technically does not cross the @entity11 until she crosses the ridge ' we have no idea how far she will go , but @entity46 , the @entity59 , and the coast of @entity61 are all feasible , ' dr @entity44 said			1
the act of tagging the shark , let alone predicting where it will travel , was a feat in itself			0
a 75,000lb hydraulic platform was used to hoist @entity6 from the water in order to fit the tracking device			2
though @entity6 's journey is impressive , great whites are known for their marathon migrations			1
in 2003 a great white nicknamed @entity74 travelled from @entity61 to @entity75 and back - a some 12,400 miles			1
in recent years there have been several sightings of great whites off the coast of @entity5			2
in september last year , fisherman @entity79 said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of @entity83 in southern @entity9			2
the suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a ' giant shark ' get close to his vessel			0
all those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark , saying the creature was much larger , prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white			1
great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world , reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight			1
@entity104 tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long - distance journeys			2
the @entity111 has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009			2
the study has shown that great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months			2
they are traditionally tracked off the coasts of @entity61 , @entity75 , @entity115 , the west coast of @entity47 from @entity117 up to @entity118 , the @entity119 and @entity120			2
the creatures have a ferocious reputation but are respsonsible for between a third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each year			0
they are highly adapted predators , detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away			0
their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth , arranged across several rows			0
gathering speed and approaching their prey from beneath , great whites can leap clear of the water , breaching like whales to attack			0
they commonly feed on sea lions , seals , small toothed whales , and sea turtles			0
the predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year			0
if food is scarce , the sharks will try to avoid fighting , instead engaging in a tail - slapping contest along the surface of the water			0
the winner delivers the most slaps			0
scientists do not have a reliable idea of the species ' population across the world , but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and sharks being caught accidentally in nets			0
they are listed as an endangered species .			0

@entity6 , a *satellite* - tagged 15ft , 2,000lb great white , is currently 1,000 miles from the coast of @entity9 and @entity10
she has swam 380 miles in 72 hours and is near the @entity40
if she swims over the @entity40 range she will be the first recorded great white to cross the @entity11
