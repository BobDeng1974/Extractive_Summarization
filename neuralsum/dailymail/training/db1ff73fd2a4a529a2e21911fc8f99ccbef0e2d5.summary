when he was sent the letter , @entity2 weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall			1
since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight			1
his mother @entity23 , 25 , of @entity24 , @entity16 , @entity17 , says : ' it is something he worries about			1
it 's ridiculous , i just keep telling him he 's strong , he 's not fat , he 's strong			1
' it definitely affected him , and he is really worried about his weight			1
' i was so angry because i was given a letter basically saying that i 'm not looking after him properly , but i do			2
he thinks he is too fat and he 's six			2
' to try to help youngsters worried about their weight , mps have made recommendations that all school children receive compulsory body image and self - esteem classes			1
it follows a report by the @entity45 on body image , which said more than half of the public has a negative body image and girls as young as five now worry about how they look			2
the parliamentary group report also said cosmetic surgery rates have increased by nearly 20 per cent since 2008 and blames media images of super skinny celebrities			2
as part of the same recommendation there was a call for a review into the @entity61 , suggesting it be amended to include appearance - related discrimination			2
another recommendation was a review into whether the @entity61 should be amended to include appearance - related discrimination , which would be classed the same as race and sexual discrimination			2
@entity23 , welcomed anything that could be done to help children , but says government involvement was one of the reasons @entity2 was so self conscious about his weight			1
@entity76 - @entity75 , principal of the @entity77 , both in @entity78 , @entity17 believes classes to help children with self - esteem and body image issues would be a positive step			2
she said : ' i see things from two sides - i think in some ways it is important that children are aware of their bodies for health and medical reasons			0
children should be aware of the importance of exercise and not getting over-weight			0
' but i also think the government could do more in teaching children that everyone is different			0
we all have different body shapes and we are all good at many different things			0
these realities should be appreciated			0
' i would say that the ad agencies for tv commercials have made big changes since i first came into the industry			0
the casting briefs we get these days are often looking for ' real children ' - they want children of all shapes and sizes , from all races			0
it did n't used to be like that			0
anger : @entity2 's mother @entity116 with the letter sent by the school nurse			1
when it arrived , @entity2 weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall			1
since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight ' as for the mags and brochures , they are specifically looking for perfect children			1
i do n't think this is such a good thing as it puts a hell of a strain on young children			0
' i find a lot of children are very self aware of their bodies and the children who come to us for dance classes are particularly aware			0
many come for fun and exercise which is great - they are aware of body health			0
' clinical psychologist @entity144 said : ' body image is a major issue and can lead onto other problems ; commercial and cultural pressures are real			0
