by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 26 february 2013 tipping the scales at nearly 26 stone , it teacher @entity1 was n't setting a healthy example to pupils at his @entity7 school - and they were n't afraid to point it out			1
now @entity1 , 25 , fed up with the teasing , has lost nearly half his bodyweight - an amazing 11 stone 3lbs - in just two years			1
at his heaviest , @entity1 weighed 25 stone 11lb , had a massive 60in waist and was so large it took him 10 minutes to bend down and put his shoes on every morning			1
mr @entity16 : @entity1 has lost more than 11 stone ( left ) and is now fitter and healthier than ever before hefty : at his most well - padded , @entity1 tipped the scales at nearly 26 stone and had a colossal 60in waist the 6ft 2in cycling fan now weighs 14st 8lbs and sports a trim 36in waist but says he has had to spend hundreds of pounds on a new wardrobe because he is swamped by his old super-sized clothes			1
' i 'm 6ft 2in which probably means i could get away with carrying a bit of extra weight , but now i feel much healthier , ' said @entity1 ' when i put the weight on i was quite happy in myself and felt i did n't need to diet			1
i did get some comments from the pupils , nothing too bad but the word ' tubby ' was used a few times			2
' i took it in good humour because i have a good relationship with the students but things came to a head when i had my picture taken on sport 's day			0
' my body virtually filled the entire picture which was embarrassing and i knew i had to do something to change my appearance			2
i looked in the mirror and thought ' who is that person ? '			0
' i decided to lose weight over the summer holiday and just saw it as a short - term thing			2
' suits you sir ! thanks to the loss of nearly half his body weight , @entity1 now gets compliments from his pupils unusually , @entity1 had thought he had a healthy diet because he always skipped breakfast and lunch before binge - eating in the evenings			1
' during the day i would just have fizzy drinks , no food at all , but then at night i would have an @entity69 , @entity70 , pizza or go to the chippy after marking the pupils work			2
' now i usually have porridge for breakfast , a chicken wrap for lunch and then a steak and jacket potato for dinner			0
i do still have treats like an @entity69 meal but i tend to go for a lighter option			0
' but the real change came courtesy of a healthy new hobby : cycling			0
' my friends suggested i start cycling and i just could n't stop , ' he explains			0
' i was clocking up hundreds of miles a month and went as often as i could			0
' i decided to carry on and the weight has managed to keep coming off and now i feel much better			0
' when you are used to seeing yourself every day you do n't notice the change but i do think it 's ridiculous when i look at photos of myself from a few years ago , or i get my big trousers out			0
slim : @entity1 ' healthy new diet and passion for cycling long distances has had impressive results what 's more , even @entity1 ' pupils have noticed his rapidly dwindling waistline - and changed their tune to boot			1
' the children at school tell me that they can see i 'm losing weight - they think my face has changed quite a bit and people are always telling me i look younger , ' their teacher adds			2
' now i weigh 14st 8lb and my goal is 13st 13lb so i have n't got too far to go			0
' teasing : pupils at @entity112 branded @entity1 ' tubby ' but after his weight loss , he 's had the last laugh @entity1 and a group of fellow slimmers will cycle 136 miles from @entity115 , @entity116 , to @entity117 , in april to raise money for the @entity123 children 's charity			1
breakfast : nothing lunch : nothing supper : @entity69 or @entity70 takeaway , pizza , chips snacks : full fat fizzy drinks exercise : none breakfast : porridge lunch : chicken wrap supper : steak with a baked potato snacks : none exercise : @entity145 cycling plus training for a 136 mile charity bike ride			1
