by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:29 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 13:16 est , 23 december 2012 @entity2 : police officer @entity3 the @entity4 can today name the policeman at the centre of the ‘ @entity10 ’ row that cost former government chief whip @entity8 his job			1
as doubts grow about the allegations made against mr @entity8 , we can identify @entity3 as the officer involved in the @entity16 fracas – and the man believed to have written the official log of the incident			1
in the 442 - word account , it is stated that mr @entity8 called police ‘ plebs ’ when they stopped him from riding his bike through the @entity16 gates – an allegation the former minister has always denied – and used language that left passers - by ‘ visibly shocked ’			1
the claims led to a media storm and mr @entity8 ’s resignation			2
however @entity34 footage of the incident , made public last week , cast serious doubt on the log ’s version of events , and increased the pressure on @entity41 to return mr @entity8 to frontline politics			1
the video showed mr @entity3 , 42 , ushering mr @entity8 through the side gate of @entity16 – but no sign of a blazing row			1
@entity47 is now investigating the possibility that mr @entity8 has been the victim of a conspiracy among officers angered by government cuts			1
and last night , as concern about the affair grew , @entity53 commissioner @entity52 broke off from his holiday to return to duty			2
mr @entity52 , who has been criticised for his handling of the case , said he had returned to work ‘ because of his concern for the welfare of all the officers and their families involved in the events surrounding the incident ’			2
last week it was claimed that another policeman sent an email to an mp , falsely claiming to be a member of the public who witnessed the row while passing @entity16 with his nephew			2
that officer , @entity4 can also disclose today , is 52 - year - old @entity75 , who like mr @entity3 is a member of the @entity76			1
mr @entity75 , from @entity77 , @entity78 , was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of misconduct in public office			1
in a further development , this newspaper has been told that mr @entity75 – who denied being a witness to the original incident when confronted by @entity86 ’s political editor @entity85 last week – is related to a second man arrested over the affair , a 23 - year - old			1
when approached by a @entity4 reporter at his home near @entity101 last week , shaven - headed mr @entity3 , who is married to another police officer , @entity98 , declined to discuss his role in the incident , claiming not to ‘ know anything about it ’			1
as he washed his car outside his semi-detached village home near the @entity108 , he added : ‘ i do n’t know anything about that , mate			2
you will have to speak to @entity47			2
’ when questioned on whether he had been asked not to talk by the police , he sighed and asked the reporter to leave			1
later that day , mr @entity3 was visited by two police officers , though it was not clear if they formally questioned him			1
afterwards one of the officers said : ‘ they are not prepared to talk			0
they are not prepared to make any statements			0
’ mr @entity3 is due to be asked about the apparent discrepancies in the official log – along with a female police officer who was also in @entity16 at the time			1
mr @entity8 ’s supporters have called for the two officers to be suspended during the investigation , but @entity47 say they remain on duty			1
police have suggested that 30 officers are examining whether there was a conspiracy to smear mr @entity8 and are conducting ‘ a large scale and complex investigation ’			1
one thing it will try to determine is why the log and the email contained such similar accounts of the september 19 incident			2
@entity16 beat : mr @entity3 is thought to have written the log about mr @entity8 last night leading @entity142 mp @entity141 , who has played a prominent role trying to clear mr @entity8 ’s name , called for the former chief whip to be restored to the @entity146 in his previous job as international development secretary			1
‘ i think that mr @entity8 should return to the @entity146 at the earliest opportunity , ’ mr @entity141 said			0
‘ his honour and reputation is clearly fully restored			0
he has shown tremendous courage to recover from the way he was completely shredded over these false allegations			0
i see no reason why he should not be given back his old job as international development secretary , where his work won widespread praise at home and abroad			0
’ but @entity16 contested the suggestion that mr @entity41 should have kept mr @entity8 in his job , releasing a statement which insisted that the prime minister backed his colleague for as long as he could			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister has deep sympathy for @entity8 after allegations emerged that a serving police officer fabricated evidence against him			1
the prime minister stood behind his chief whip through weeks of growing demands to sack him			0
it was only when it became clear that he could no longer do his job that his resignation was accepted with reluctance			0
‘ @entity8 did not disagree with the prime minister ’s approach throughout this period			0
the prime minister , and @entity8 , were deeply shocked to be informed that the police were investigating allegations that a serving police officer had lied about the events			1
’ the @entity34 footage of the incident further stoked the already rancorous dispute between the @entity188 and @entity47 by appearing to show that there were no ‘ shocked ’ members of the public			0
the @entity192 vigorously pursued the claims against mr @entity8 , with some branches of the employees ’ body organising protests where officers wore ‘ @entity200 ’ t - shirts			0
its chairman @entity201 said he would apologies to mr @entity202 if it was proved that he did not call police officers ‘ plebs ’			2
mr @entity201 has acknowledged concerns that the federation ‘ stoked up ’ the @entity16 incident			0
he has handed control of the federation to his successor - elect @entity211 a month before he is officially due to leave the role , due to ‘ pre-existing leave arrangements ’			0
and one of mr @entity211 ’s first acts was to announce plans for a review prompted by the @entity8 incident			0
‘ recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the federation nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate , ’ he said in a statement			0
‘ my first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way			0
’ mr @entity52 , who has publicly backed the officers involved , now faces a grilling by @entity234 over the handling of the affair			0
mr @entity8 was reported to have doubts over the @entity53 chief ’s impartiality after he said the original log was not contradicted by the @entity34 footage			2
@entity242 , chairman of the @entity243 , said : ‘ there are serious questions that need answering			0
’ asked about mr @entity52 ’s position , @entity47 said its investigation into the affair ‘ is progressing with urgency , whilst maintaining an open mind and a determination to leave no stone unturned ’			2
a spokesman declined to respond to questions about mr @entity3 ’s involvement in the row			1
he also declined to confirm that mr @entity75 was the officer arrested			1
sir @entity258 , president of the @entity259 , yesterday insisted this was an isolated case			0
he said : ‘ there ’s always been – and there should be – a healthy tension between politicians and the police service i do n’t think this is evidence of a growing distrust			2
’ @entity269 arose about nature of ' pleb ' accusations during @entity86 documentary sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
