@entity0 was rewarded with a straightforward win at @entity2 after selecting as strong line - up against the @entity5 side – and saw 18 - year - old @entity6 impress on his full debut			1
without impressing , @entity8 were rarely troubled by @entity11 ’s side and they at least registered their first goal of the season even if none of their own players scored it			1
they were the beneficiaries of an own goal courtesy of @entity2 defender @entity19 , after @entity20 broke down the right and delivered a dangerously - placed cross which caused the @entity23 to miscue and put through his own net on 25 minutes			1

manager : @entity0 7 referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) 6 it was a curiously un-spirited display by @entity2 who tried to out - wit @entity8 rather than out - fight them , with their back three formation			2
but their wing backs were constantly pinned back by the pace of @entity20 and @entity6 , which ruined their hopes of having extra men in midfield			2
@entity6 , the @entity82 - born 18 - year - old who grew up in @entity83 , looked especially sharp on his full debut having come on as a substitute on the opening day of the season against @entity88			1
he was consistently inventive until he went off injured on the hour and went close on 36 minutes when @entity34 saved			0
@entity8 were dominant without being threatening having started with seven of the players who featured against @entity90 in the @entity91 on saturday			1
however , two of those , @entity60 and @entity93 , looked anonymous as they struggled to link up with their team - mates , with most of @entity8 ’s threats coming from the wing			2
impressed : @entity6 , 18 , was a stand - out for @entity8 on his full debut as @entity8 eased to victory going hard : the @entity99 ' @entity41 tackles @entity8 's @entity55 at @entity100 nevertheless , @entity8 were quite clearly a class above their opponents throughout and kept possession excellently			1
@entity2 ’s attacking input was extremely limited			0
@entity44 did manage to get away on 12 minutes and run into space but @entity53 shepherded him effectively away and won the ball with a crunching challenge which prompted an ambitious penalty appeal from @entity2 , which referee @entity69 declined			0
and wing back @entity109 almost beat @entity51 with a curling shot from the edge of the box on 36 minutes but otherwise it was quite first half for @entity8 ’s defenders			2
put to work : @entity2 keeper @entity34 was up to the challenge when peppered by @entity8 imposing : @entity53 makes a crunching tackle on @entity118 @entity8 started the second half in much the same fashion an almost went further ahead in 53 minutes when @entity121 hit a superb 35 - yard strike that bounced off the cross bars			1
@entity124 then forced a save from @entity126 on 62 minutes from 20 yards			0
but @entity2 seemed curiously uninspired , standing off @entity8 and allowing their @entity91 colleagues all the time and space they required			2
only with the introduction of @entity43 on 65 minutes did @entity2 finally register a shot on goal , the 21 - year - old cutting across goal , beating @entity124 and then forcing @entity51 into a sharp save with his shot from just inside the box on 70 minutes			0
there was barely even a late rally and @entity8 were able to manage out the game comfortably without any late scares			0
it 's not too late to play @entity142 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity19 's own goal after 25 minutes was the only goal of the game
the @entity151 *youth* star turned @entity20 's cross into his own net
the own goal was the first time @entity8 scored this season
@entity0 put out a relatively strong line - up featuring seven players from the weekend 's @entity91 match against @entity90
@entity6 , 18 , impressed on his full debut for @entity8
