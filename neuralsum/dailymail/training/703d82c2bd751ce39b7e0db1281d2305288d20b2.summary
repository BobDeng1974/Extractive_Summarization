by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 14:47 est , 9 may 2013 a man was left stunned after discovering a postcard , which fell out of a book he bought from a charity shop , had originally been sent from his brother to his late mother 25 years ago			1
grandfather - of - five @entity9 , 70 , bought a biography of @entity11 from @entity13 charity shop in @entity14 , @entity15 , for 50p - but it was n't until he got it home and started reading it that the postcard fluttered to the floor			1
he read the note with general musings about a holiday in @entity23 - and only realised the incredible coincidence when he looked at the address it had been sent to was his mother 's			2
incredible coincidence : @entity9 ( right ) with the @entity29 and postcard sen by his brother @entity31 ( left ) to their late mother 25 years ago the card had been sent by his brother , @entity31 , 65 , to his mother @entity35 in 1988 - and mr @entity9 believes @entity35 had used it as a bookmark inside his late father 's book			1
mr @entity9 , a retired salesman who lives in @entity14 with wife @entity40 , 70 , a retired home care worker , said : ' i just could n't believe it			1
what are the odds of something like that happening ? recipient : the postcard was originally sent to @entity48 by hers son @entity31 when he was visiting @entity23 in 1988 ' i was astonished			1
i got goosebumps - it 's unbelievable			0
' he explained : ' i often go in to the charity shop to look through the books			1
' like my father , i 'm interested in @entity11 so that 's why i got the book about two weeks ago			1
' it was n't until i was home later that i opened the book to have a read			0
' i think the postcard might have been tucked inside the back cover because as i flicked through , it fluttered to the floor			0
' i picked it up and i suppose i was just being a bit nosy reading it			0
' the postcard had a picture of a statue in @entity23 , and on the back it said how good the weather was , how @entity23 was , and joked about how somebody had tried to sell him the statue which was pictured - typical tourist stuff			0
' i did n't recognise the names at the bottom because they were n't very clear - but as i looked at the address i could n't believe it - it was addressed to my mother			1
' it was then i realised it was sent to her by @entity31 and his wife @entity85 when they were on holiday in 1988			1
' i told my wife straight away - she did n't believe me , and i had to show it to her before she would listen properly			0
' and as soon as i could , i phoned @entity31 , and said i 've had a postcard from you , from @entity23			2
' he could n't understand what i was on about because obviously he has n't been to @entity93 for years			0
' as i explained it , he was gobsmacked and said something i could n't really repeat			0
' the postcard is ' immaculate ' , and mr @entity9 believes it must have been used as a bookmark to keep it in such good condition			2
he 's given it back to his brother to keep			2
chance find : mr @entity9 discovered the postcard in a biography of @entity11 he bought from a charity shop in @entity14 , @entity15 sender : @entity31 holds the postcard he wrote to his mother all those years ago his mother lived in @entity14 until she died in 1999 , and after her death the brothers donated some of her books to the home 's library and somehow the book has made its way to the charity shop			1
mr @entity9 believes he gave the book , which was published in 1979 , to his father as a present			2
' i 'd love to know who donated the book and where it 's been on its travels			0
i normally donate my books back to charity but i think i 'll be hanging on to this one , ' he added .			0
