@entity0 knows a thing or two about scoring , so when he made public his thoughts on @entity3 it was with numbers in mind			1
‘ playing in front of @entity9 's midfield , ’ he wrote on @entity6			1
‘ should guarantee a minimum of 25 goals a season , for a striker of note			1
’ the man who won the @entity17 at the 1986 @entity18 believes the silver service laid on by @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , to name the starters against @entity25 , is of such quality @entity3 should top the scoring charts			1
against @entity25 , @entity3 was limp , wasting his team ’s best chances to the fury of fans never shy to voice opinions on social media			1
his @entity62 - on - ice attempt at a finish when put in by @entity20 ’s delicate dink was illustrative of someone short on confidence but also provided further evidence he lacks that killer instinct possessed by @entity70 ’s elite			0
that , for a club of @entity9 ’s aspirations , is some concern given he is now 27 and in the prime years of his career			1
despite standing 6ft 3in tall he is not a striker to bulldoze defences , nor one to race through them either – his pace too limited			0
instead he scores his goals through craft and guile , often after smart interchanges with a supporting cast that moves like a carousel			0
in his first season after his £ 12million move from @entity87 in 2012 he found the net 11 times in 34 @entity90 matches			1
last season he scored 16 in 36 @entity90 games			2
outmuscled : @entity3 struggles to reach the ball under pressure from @entity94 and @entity95 as @entity9 were held out in @entity96 lonely job : @entity3 was underwhelming as the focal point in @entity9 's attack floored : the @entity100 tries to hook the ball in from the ground as defenders and the goalkeeper close in @entity3 's heat map against @entity25 these are not insubstantial returns for the sum paid but , as @entity111 highlighted , when assisted by a midfield of the calibre @entity44 has assembled they shrink			1
@entity113 and @entity114 , for example , did not even feature in @entity96			0
last season @entity3 started well , scoring five goals in his first six games in all competitions for @entity9 , but experienced a barren spell of two goals in 12 games – a brace against @entity122 – throughout november and december			1
then in february compromising pictures emerged of him enjoying a late - night hotel rendezvous with a woman who was not his wife			0
he issued an apology to his family and supporters and six goals in 12 @entity90 games followed but he did not appear to play with the energy of early season			1
hinging too much on that incident would be foolish , though			0
the deeper worry with @entity3 is that he is simply not top level – as his exploits against @entity139 ’s elite clubs shows			2
in 23 matches against @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 since his arrival at the @entity141 , he has scored three goals – two against @entity148 and once against @entity150 ’ team			2
it is a record that should ring alarm bells for @entity44			2
he must be aware of the need to spend serious money on a central striker who would guarantee goals and actually scare defences at the high end of the league			2
@entity3 does not have that fear factor			0
@entity162 and @entity163 are two such forwards , available this summer , who would deliver both			1
their prices are exorbitant but @entity44 has shown with deals for @entity113 and @entity20 he will splash the cash on proven talent			0
if that then means winning the @entity90 title the cost would be instantly repaid			1
time to splash out : @entity173 's @entity163 is among the strikers available this summer for sale : @entity176 's @entity162 is another frontman that is up for grabs signed : june 2012 for £ 13million 2012 - 13 - @entity179 47 goals 17 2013 - 14 - @entity179 51 goals 22 2014 - 15 - games 3 goals 1 total : games 101 goals 40 giroud averages a goal ever two - and - a - half games for @entity9 you suspect , though , that @entity44 still has not entirely shrugged off his habit for stubborn persistence with budget options – in the belief he can improve players and maintain financial equilibrium among his squad			1
@entity3 firing @entity9 to the title would mean that much more to him personally , however unlikely			1
it is the same for @entity197 , the 21 - year - old @entity100 bought for nothing last summer			0
he started against @entity199 and was fine but no way near the striker @entity9 need with @entity34 and cup runs desired too			2
@entity203 had a promising pre-season but still has not scored a competitive goal for @entity9 in 15 appearances			0
@entity207 , the @entity208 striker , has been on the bench and it seems @entity44 does not wholly trust him yet			2
there is little competitive rivalry to spur @entity3 on			0
drought : @entity197 has n't scored for @entity9 in 15 competitive appearances waiting : @entity215 star @entity207 is waiting for a chance in the @entity90 in years gone by @entity44 has been able to call on an awesome lineage of scorers ; @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223			1
these were strikers who would conjure three points with a flick of their boot and win titles			0
@entity3 , sadly , is destined never to be added to that list			0
unless @entity44 acts , @entity0 ’s words are set to linger			1
you can like our dedicated @entity233 page here			0
@entity237 - @entity236 striker has seen an £ 8.5m move to @entity145 fall through this summer but could yet be offloaded to anyone who can meet his wage demands			0
scored 14 goals during a loan spell at @entity144 last season			0
@entity163 - @entity44 is a big admirer of the @entity173 striker , who scored 25 times last season , but he certainly would n't come cheap			1
@entity247 - @entity44 wo n't admit his interest in the @entity250 striker but @entity9 are definitely interested			1
@entity247 could move on as @entity250 do n't have @entity34 football this season			2
the striker wants £ 150,000 net in wages each week though			0
@entity162 - not linked with @entity9 yet but certainly available			2
scored 19 goals for @entity176 last season and will perform in a superior league			0
@entity258 @entity260 red card unbelievable - @entity44			0

@entity3 again struggled to make an impact as @entity9 drew with @entity25
@entity0 *tweeted* that @entity100 should be scoring 25 goals a season given the quality of @entity9 's midfield
striker is 27 and should be in the prime of his career
struggles in matches against @entity9 's @entity90 title rivals
growing belief that @entity44 should *buy* a new striker
@entity163 , @entity162 and @entity247 are *possibilities*
