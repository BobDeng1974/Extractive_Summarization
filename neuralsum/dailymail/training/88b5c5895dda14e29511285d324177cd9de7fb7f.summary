the company 's contact number is ex-directory and it does not have a website ' it was n't about the money - it was more about the principle and i wanted everybody to know that they do n't have to stand by and allow these nuisance calls to persist in their homes			1
' they were breaking the law because we were registered with the @entity72 - which means they should not have been contacting us in the first place			0
' but when i tried to call them - i was just spoken too very rudely and sometimes they would even hang up on me			2
' there was just no way of communicating with them and it had got to the point where it was unbearable and i felt like i had no choice but to chase it through the small claims court			2
