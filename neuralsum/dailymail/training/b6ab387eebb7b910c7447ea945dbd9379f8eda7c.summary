' you 're doing this through text message ? ? ? ? ' that was the message 38 - year - old @entity4 sent in response to a text message she received from her now - ex - fiancee , @entity8 , @entity9 , restaurateur @entity7 , when he ended their 14 - month engagement via - text in july of 2012			1
but the message @entity7 sent next ended up costing him the $ 53,000 engagement ring he bought for his now - jilted ex-fiancee			1
' @entity16 ' : a text message @entity18 ( pictured ) sent his ex-fiancee referring to her engagement ring as a ' parting ring ' cost him more than $ 50,000 prenup : @entity7 called off his engagement to @entity24 ( pictured ) after the 38 - year - old nail technician refused to sign a prenuptial agreement a @entity28 judge last week awarded @entity29 - a nail technician who met @entity7 at golf tournament in 2009 - the white gold , 2.97 - carat diamond ring , or its fair , market value , based on a text @entity7 sent @entity29 after their breakup , in which he referred to the pricy ring as a ' parting ring , ' implying that it was a gift			1
@entity42 reportedly ended the engagement after his much - younger would - be - bride refused to sign a prenuptial agreement			2
however , @entity29 's attorney , @entity46 , tells @entity47 that is n't true			1
' [ @entity29 ] did agree to the prenup , ' @entity46 says			0
when asked why @entity7 ended the engagement - if @entity29 agreed to the prenup - @entity46 said she ' [ does n't ] want to speculate			2
' ' the decision speaks for itself , ' she said			0
@entity7 's attorney , @entity51 , tells @entity47 that he is ' surprised [ @entity46 ] would even say something like that ' when told that @entity46 claims her client agreed to sign the prenup			1
however , @entity51 says his client has ' no reaction to the [ judge 's ] ruling			0
' under the law , courts are typically inclined to side with the groom in disputes over engagement rings - legally , the groom is still entitled to the ring , even if he is the one who calls off the wedding			2
and just weeks after calling off the wedding - and despite his assurance that it was a ' parting ring ' - the 55 - year - old co-owner of @entity8 's @entity70 wanted the ring back			1
however , because @entity7 responded to @entity29 's outrage over being dumped in a text message by telling her ' plus you get a $ 50,000 parting ring			1
enough for a down payment on a house , ' judge @entity77 ruled that the ring had become a gift , and was no longer part of a contract for marriage			0
ladies man : @entity7 claimed that the text calling the ring a ' parting ring ' was a joke , like a game - show contestant 's parting gift just weeks after ending their engagement , @entity7 began sending @entity29 text messages threatening to take back the ring if she continued to insult him following the breakup			1
' keep it up , and i will take back the ring as well , ' he wrote in one text message dated july 20 , 2012			0
after deciding he wanted the ring back , @entity7 sent @entity29 a text message stating that ' by law have to give it back			1
you ’re nowhere near the person i thought you were			0
you do n’t deserve it			0
' in his ruling , judge @entity77 said that messages were further proof that ' the ring had been re-gifted , ' according to @entity114			0
the judge found that @entity7 's text messages demanding the ring back indicated that he was suffering from ' giver 's remorse , ' but that did n't mean he was entitled to the ring			1
the law typically favors the groom in disputes over engagement rings , even if it is he who calls off the wedding ' many gifts are given for reasons that sour with the passage of time , ' @entity77 said in his ruling			2
however , gift law does n't entitle to the gifter to recoup the gift just because feelings have changed , @entity77 ruled			0
' once a gift is given , it is irrevocable , ' the judge concluded			0
of the text referring to the ' parting ring ' - the text that ultimately cost him more than $ 50,000 - @entity7 claimed in court that he meant it as a joke			2
' i was being sarcastic , like a game show host – you get a parting gift , ' @entity7 said .			0

@entity8 restaurateur @entity150 called off his engagement to his 38 - year - old ex-fiancee in a text message after she refused to sign a prenuptial agreement
the attorney for his jilted former fiancee , @entity24 , tells @entity47 her client never refused to sign the agreement
@entity7 told @entity29 that she could keep the engagement ring as a ' parting ring , ' implying that it was a gift
state law usually sides with the would - be groom in disputes over engagement rings
however , a judge ruled that because @entity7 referred to the ring as a ' parting ring , ' it is implied that it is a gift , and he was simply suffering from ' giver 's remorse '
