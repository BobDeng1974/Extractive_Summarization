by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 20 august 2013 a mother subjected her toddler son to a sickening catalogue of beatings , which left him looking like he had been ‘ hit with a frying pan ’			1
the son , just 22 months old at the time , suffered four broken bones in his arm and shoulder and numerous bruises to his head and body in a week			1
his horrific injuries were revealed at @entity14 in @entity15 as the 22 - year - old ‘ depressed ’ woman was jailed for four years			1
shocking : his horrific injuries were revealed at @entity14 ( file picture ) in @entity15 as the 22 - year - old woman was jailed for four years the woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to pin the blame for the injuries on others			1
her father was even interviewed by police , because he helped look after the child			2
she was convicted of three counts of wounding and of neglect			2
all of the assaults all took place in one week two years ago in @entity34			1
as well as being jailed , the woman was banned from ever looking after children again - including if she has any more children of her own			1
judge @entity38 said : ‘ the one person a child should look to for protection is his mother but this was a case which involved a parent inflicting harm upon a child			1
‘ you did things to him which resulted in him having multiple fractures to his body and arms , bruising his cheeks and a significant head injury			2
‘ one witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan			2
why you did it remains a complete mystery			0
‘ you have never told the truth about what happened , you repeatedly changed your account and sought to blame others			1
‘ your lies meant your father was interviewed as he had been caring for him at your request , you sought to blame your friend partner or at least inferred that			1
‘ the jury were completely satisfied that the person who repeatedly injured him was you			0
abuse : the woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to blame others for the injuries ( picture posed by model ) ‘ you even told your friends that he had bruising to his cheeks and went through the farce of getting them to research it			1
‘ one response was that it may be a rare blood disease or even meningitis			0
you faked surprise when a lady at nursery saw him			0
‘ you quite deliberately did everything you could do to deflect suspicion from you			0
your conduct was not an isolated event			0
' but it is impossible to say when all this happened			0
not all the injuries are of the same age - bruising to the cheek on monday , the remaining injuries between tuesday and thursday evening , he had four fractures			1
‘ fortunately he has recovered from his injuries , how he will feel when he finds out what his mother has done to him is anyone ’s guess			1
' one witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan			0
why you did it remains a complete mystery ' judge @entity38 ‘ it is quite clear to me this was course of conduct over a period of time rather than an isolated incident although how you caused these injuries is impossible to say			1
’ the court heard that after she was arrested the child ’s father attacked her and is he now serving a ‘ lengthy ’ prison sentence for assault			0
@entity123 , defending , said : ‘ she understands that nothing i can say can go beyond the verdict of the jury			0
she has lost her son			1
‘ she also dreads the day when he is older and comes to know what happened and that she has some very serious questions to answer			0
‘ thankfully he has been placed with her mother , which is of some comfort to her			2
’ @entity137 detective sergeant @entity136 said : ‘ we have never been able to identify how the injuries were caused to the young boy as she denied the allegations throughout the trial			2
‘ this was a complex and difficult case to investigate			0
the injuries sustained by the child were extensive but fortunately he has since made a full recovery			2
‘ the sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime committed and reinforces that behaviour of this cruel nature will not be tolerated			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
