given how he divides opinion , there ’s probably the same number of people who feel sorry for @entity5 as there are who believe the @entity8 should be in @entity9			1
notwithstanding that the @entity10 is the footballer with the closest skill - and - thrill set to those of @entity13 and @entity14 , the fact that he is ruthlessly dedicated to persuading referees that any contact or attempted contact on him around the area is a penalty alienates many			2
however , anyone with an ounce of generosity , everyone who admires his fabulous combination of athleticism , pace , skill , technique and power should find it easy to generate some sympathy for the 30 - year - old			1
instead of his reputation being given sheen by having been champion of every country in which he ’s played ( @entity44 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 ) , or having scored the winner in a @entity65 final , the pall of blowing opportunities to achieve absolute greatness hangs stubbornly over him			1
within five torrid weeks in spring 2012 , he missed two penalties			0
first , against @entity67 , when a win would have put @entity70 joint top of the @entity71 but defeat doubled the existing three - point gap			0
in due course @entity75 ’s team won the title			0
@entity5 has been with @entity70 since 2009 , where he has won three @entity79 and the @entity65 the @entity10 winger has won league titles in every country he has played , including two with @entity83 then , in that gut - wrenching , disastrous defeat at @entity70 ’s own stadium in the @entity65 final against @entity83 , @entity84 easily saved @entity5 ’s extra-time penalty at a time when @entity70 were motoring and the @entity91 , frankly , did n’t look like they had another goal in them			1
add that to the one - on - one miss against @entity97 in the 2010 @entity88 against @entity61			1
his career may be in full bloom but through @entity5 ’s 21 - trophy time line there emerges a thread of pain , disappointment , failure and ill - fortune			1
just as he reaches the absolute peak of his form and fitness , the @entity10 national team have become immensely idiosyncratic			2
they reached that @entity8 final four years ago , but contested it like bar brawlers			1
@entity116 was horrific , but they ended @entity118 2014 in third place and just millimetres short of a place in the final , shredding @entity61 en route			2
@entity5 scores the winning goal against @entity67 in the 2013 @entity65 final at @entity126 @entity5 gets his hands on the @entity65 trophy after @entity70 's win over @entity67 thus far , the @entity131 era is nothing short of a botch - up — five defeats in the last seven matches , including a classic pratfall in @entity137 against @entity138			1
@entity42 has promised to quit should @entity44 lose to @entity41			0
@entity5 is an immense footballer yet , when the @entity139 is awarded in january you can take it that he wo n’t be in the top three with @entity13 ( winner ) and @entity14 ( second )			2
@entity70 team - mates like @entity144 and @entity145 and @entity147 ’s @entity146 might be , while @entity148 is a decent bet to finish above @entity5			2
the winger ’s best finish is eighth			0
he says : ‘ 2013 was a brilliant year in terms of trophies			0
i won the @entity154 with @entity70			0
but in terms of my own professional development and sheer intensity , 2014 has been outstanding			0
i ’ve played all year without any major injuries and was on superb form physically during the @entity8			1
’ @entity5 sees a penalty against @entity83 in the 2012 @entity65 final saved by @entity84 the @entity10 looked dejected after watching the @entity65 slip away in @entity162 @entity44 had a tough time at @entity116 as they lost all three games against @entity62 , @entity166 and @entity167 beyond ending his reputation of being made of crystal , physiologically , @entity5 has also shown steely fortitude mentally			1
‘ @entity173 was a very difficult period			0
there were those penalties i missed and then , after the @entity65 final defeat to @entity83 , we came back to a @entity44 friendly days later to suffer jeers and whistles in the @entity179 , our own stadium			1
‘ then catastrophic games in @entity183 / @entity182 2012 when @entity44 was knocked out in the first round			0
it was like living a nightmare			0
‘ getting the decisive goal in the @entity65 final against @entity67 was such a liberating moment			1
’ and , compared to the threat of @entity41 robbing @entity5 of another international manager , his club career at @entity70 — good candidates for a second @entity154 in three years — could not be better			2
the @entity10 is in thrall to his club coach and admits @entity195 has made him a better player			0
developments for which @entity42 will be deeply grateful .			0

@entity10 winger has stayed injury free and is playing some of his best football
@entity5 has won league titles in every country he has played
30 - year - old scored winner in 2013 @entity65 final
@entity10 has also *spurned* opportunities that would have *redefined* his career , such as the 2010 @entity8 final against @entity61
