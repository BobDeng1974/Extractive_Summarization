by @entity0 the @entity1 refused to comply today with a subpoena issued by the @entity3 demanding that the president 's official political adviser testify before @entity6			1
the president 's director of the @entity9 , @entity10 , was scheduled to appear before the @entity12 committee today to state for the record that his work does not violate a federal law that bans most executive branch employees from engaging in political activity			1
but @entity18 sent a letter to the committee last night saying @entity6 does n't have the authority to require the president 's chief advisers to give testimony			1
@entity12 chairman @entity25 opted to allow the hearing to start today without @entity10 , arguing in his opening statement that the committee has a ' legal obligation ' to make sure that taxpayer dollars are not being spent on illegal activity			1
the @entity1 says that the president 's official political adviser @entity10 , pictured here to the right of president @entity36 in 2010 , is immune from congressional subpenas the @entity1 's @entity38 has been under scrutiny since @entity40 controlled @entity6 and @entity41 controlled the @entity1 during the tenure of @entity43			1
president @entity36 kept the office open through the 2010 midterm congressional elections but closed it shortly afterward amid concerns that the office 's work involved partisan political activity			1
earlier this year the @entity1 reopened the office ahead of the upcoming midterm elections under a slightly different name , raising anew suspicions among @entity41 legislators that the office may be engaging in activity that violates federal law			1
a 1939 law called the @entity59 bars executive branch employees , excluding the president , vice president and a handful of other officials , from conducting political activity on federal property and from soliciting political contributions			1
so far , @entity36 's chief political adviser has n't done anything to incite a congressional investigation into his work other than holding the political affairs position			2
however , @entity25 said today that his committee does ' not and should not need a smoking gun ' to look into whether taxpayer dollars are being spent improperly			2
given that the committee 's ' most key witness ' in today 's hearing ' has chosen to defy the committee 's legal obligation and its subpoena , ' the @entity41 lawmaker announced that he would recess the hearing until a future date after opening statements			1
@entity25 could be waiting indefinitely for the hearing to restart if its predicated on @entity88 testifying			0
in the letter informing the oversight committee of mr. @entity10 ' intentions not to appear before the committee in an official capacity , @entity18 cited a legal opinion from the @entity96 's @entity95 stating that ' the president ’s immediate advisers are absolutely immune from the congressional testimonial process			1
' ' this immunity is rooted in the constitutional separation of powers , and in the immunity of the president himself from congressional compulsion to testify , ' the letter said , quoiting the @entity95			0
in his remarks at this morning 's hearing , @entity25 dismissed the @entity96 's opinion , claiming ' it is at odds with rulings from our judicial branch about checks and balances			2
' @entity25 said his committee has had ' patience for months , and gave the @entity1 extensive opportunities to explain concerns ' through briefings and documents			0
mr. @entity10 ' failure to show up to today 's hearing makes the claim that the @entity1 is doing ' everything right indefensible , ' he said a few minutes later			2
prior to today , @entity18 offered to sit down with @entity25 and answer questions about the reopening of the political office outside a congressional hearing if @entity25 withdrew his subpoena ' while i am hopeful that we can work together constructively to address your stated interests , your subpoena is not helpful to these efforts , ' @entity18 told @entity25 in a letter on monday			1
' as you know , it has been the view of administrations from both political parties that summoning the president ’s most senior advisors to provide public testimony raises significant separation of power concerns			0
' @entity3 chairman @entity25 , right , and ranking member rep. @entity149 , left , are pictured here in march at an oversight hearing having a fiery disagreement over the way @entity25 runs the committee			1
@entity149 lambasted @entity25 again during a hearing today , saying he was undermining the committee by unilaterally issuing subpoenas a @entity158 with knowledge of the situation told @entity161 that @entity25 sent nine staffers to the @entity1 yesterday who asked 45 questions over the course of an hour and fifteen minute meeting , and the sit down only concluded when @entity41 had finished making inquiries			1
@entity25 did n't attend the meeting , however , the source said			0
' guess who did n’t even bother to show - up ? one guess			0
' but @entity10 did n't attend the meeting , either , prompting @entity25 to send @entity18 a letter yesterday afternoon restating his request for @entity10 to appear before the @entity12 committee today			1
' @entity177 has outstanding questions for mr. @entity10 , who did not take part in the briefing , and it is necessary for him to appear at tomorrow ’s hearing , ' @entity25 stated			2
' i believe his on - the - record testimony will provide valuable insight into @entity1 efforts to ensure appropriate use of taxpayer funds			0
' the ranking @entity158 on the @entity191 , @entity190 rep. @entity149 , said in a statement yesterday that the @entity1 briefing ought to have been enough for his @entity41 colleague , however			1
' there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that mr. @entity10 or anyone on his staff did anything wrong , ' he said , calling the @entity1 briefing ' detailed and thorough			0
' ' there seems to be no reason to continue this ridiculous confrontation other than to manufacture false controversy as chairman @entity25 ’s tenure comes to an end , ' he charged			2
at today 's hearing @entity207 lit into @entity25 again , saying he ' strongly ' supports the committee 's authority to issue subpoenas ' when necessary , ' but this is not one of those instances			2
witch hunts like the one @entity25 is undertaking ' undermines ' and ' degrades ' the @entity12 committee , he said , and ' makes us weaker			1
' @entity149 repeated a previous complaint that @entity25 has handed out nearly 100 subpoenas since taking over the chairmanship in 2011 , which is more than the combined total of the last three chairs			0
' this is not about me			0
this is not about this committee this is about generations unborn , ' he argued , urging @entity25 to ' change course			0
' ' when i raised concerns you did not take them seriously , ' he said , referencing a letter he wrote to @entity25 on friday asking him to take a committee vote before issuing a subpoena to mr. @entity10			2
' you did not ask other members if you were nuts or if you were wrong			0
' ' i end by saying we are better , ' @entity149 said at the conclusion of his remarks			0
' if we want to go far , let 's go together			0
if we want to go fast , let 's go alone			0
' at a briefing with reporters this afternoon @entity1 press secretary @entity239 piled on , assailing @entity25 for ' throwing out subpoenas like candy on @entity244			0
' the @entity1 spokesman said it 's causing people to ' tune him out			0

@entity3 chairman @entity25 subpenaed the president 's official political adviser , @entity10
@entity25 is concerned that @entity10 may be violating a federal law that bans most employees of the executive branch from engaging in political activity
@entity18 sent @entity25 a letter last night claiming the president 's ' immediate advisers are absolutely immune ' from such demands
@entity25 held a hearing today anyway , claiming that his committee has a ' legal obligation ' to make sure taxpayer funds are being used properly
rep. @entity149 , @entity12 's ranking @entity158 , argued during the hearing that @entity25 's behavior ' undermines ' and ' degrades ' the committee
