by @entity0 @entity1 is n't one to mess about on the rugby field , but he 's certainly been having some fun off it			0
the @entity7 prop posted a video to his @entity10 account of him shaving his beard in different stages			1
a goatee , a handlebar moustache , a @entity16 - style ' tache - and - beard combo and even half a moustache make an appearance before @entity1 goes fully clean - cut			2
big hitter : @entity20 runs into @entity22 's @entity21 and @entity23 on @entity25 duty with @entity26 starting out big : it 's a pretty normal showing from @entity1 in the first shot getting the chop : @entity1 's beard is pretty full in the first few shots bye bye facial fuzz : slowly but surely more hair makes a disappearing act funny faces : the @entity7 prop pulled out a huge repertoire of facial expressions losing it : as the video goes on , more hair disappears from the @entity43 man 's face all but gone : no more beard and just the slightest of ' tasches for @entity1 here odd finish : @entity1 's final stage saw just the tiniest bit of ' tasche left @entity1 's video will come as no surprise to regular followers of the @entity56 loosehead prop - he often shows off on his @entity10 and even occasionally djs under the alias ' @entity58 '			1
the @entity60 may have to fill his time for now but it wo n't be long until he is back in action with his club , and they face @entity66 in their season opener			0
@entity1 might no longer have the facial fuzz - aside from half a moustache that you would hope he saved off - but there 's still plenty of time to growing it back before he kicks off the new campaign on august 23			2
key : @entity20 has played for the @entity43 as well as his country			0
