@entity0 says you can learn a lot about history from studying drain covers a @entity5 has been named @entity7 's only ' drain spotter ' after spending his time scouring the streets for rare sewer covers			1
@entity0 , 42 , spends hours visiting hundreds of drains - recording them with his camera and chronicling their history			1
dubbed ' @entity17 of the @entity18 ' , @entity0 's hobby sees him visiting drains around his home city of @entity21 and further beyond			1
he admits his hobby is unusual and ' quirky ' , but insists it is ' not as boring as trainspotting '			2
@entity0 's passion was first ignited several years ago and since then he has since become obsessed - and is now thought of as @entity7 's first drain spotter			1
he is also part of local preservation group called ' @entity29 ' who work hard to retain heritage features			2
@entity0 said : ' you can get in a spot of trouble - me and a friend crawled under a car once to take a look at a drain and i guess what we were doing could have been misconstrued			1
' i like doing this because it 's quirky but it 's also important			0
if these drains were to disappear in a road resurfacing scheme it would be very disappointing			2
we honestly are n't as boring as trainspotters			0
' @entity0 's passion was sparked one day when he was walking down a street in @entity21 and he noticed three metal grates embossed with words ' @entity52			1
' mr @entity0 spends hours photographing and cataloging sewer covers in his home city of @entity21 mr @entity0 has taken pictures of scores of drains as part of his unusual hobby baffled by the name he eventually tracked down the company to 1838 during the cholera outbreak - meaning the drains were evidence of one of the first modern sanitation systems			1

' for example , there are still cut - off poles and electric access points for the old tramway , which closed in 1956			0
mr @entity0 says some drain covers have fascinating links with history and has traced some back to an 1838 cholera outbreak despite some suggesting his obsession is boring - he insists it is more interesting than trainspotting ' and there is a @entity91 cover which dates back to a time when there were just 12 telephones in @entity21			1
' @entity0 added : ' you 're more likely to see something ornate or interesting if it 's in your eyeline			2

' commenting on drains in the area , local councillor @entity101 said : ' we are restoring a number of old sewer gas street lamps and retaining old stone features , such as kerbs , where we can			2
' we are upgrading road drainage across the city to reduce road flooding and , unfortunately , this will involve replacing many of the old gully grates			0
