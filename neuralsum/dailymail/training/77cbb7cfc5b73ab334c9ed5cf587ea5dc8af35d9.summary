the stage was set for a command performance by @entity2 but it was @entity3 , named after a technical musical term , who called the tune in the @entity8 @entity7			1
the @entity10 - trained filly , third to @entity11 in the race last year , has the petit feet of a ballerina and relished the quickening conditions , bouncing off the ground to win by a length and three - quarters from @entity18 in a new course record 10 - furlong time of 2 mins 1.9 secs			1
her success was hailed as his greatest moment in racing by owner and composer @entity25 , the man who named @entity3 , bred by his wife @entity27 , and also one the few who knows what it means ! royal appointment : the @entity7 presents owner @entity25 ( r ) with the trophy but while the @entity35 - ridden 11 - 2 winner floated over the turf , @entity2 travelled like a rusty bike with a flat tyre			1
the 2013 @entity40 winner and 8 - 13 favourite trained by @entity42 and ridden by @entity43 , was only a length further back in third but the writing was on the wall before the home straight			1
it would be an exaggeration to say @entity2 is a pale shadow of the 2013 model but if someone had suggested last autumn she would be beaten on her first two runs this summer they would have been patted on the head sympathetically and told to lie down			1
the ground or a physical issue might have been the cause of yesterday ’s disappointing effort			0
but if and when she is brought back for an autumn campaign and a crack at a second @entity40 in october , she will have lost her air of invincibility			0
a crestfallen @entity43 said : ‘ she went down to the start really bad			1
maybe it was the ground ? i was following @entity3 but struggling to keep up with her and never in my comfort zone			1
’ sing when you 're wining : @entity25 claimed the victory was his greatest moment in racing @entity74 never seemed out of his on @entity3			1
the jockey has endured some mighty highs and lows with his admirable partner , whose 16 races have included 13 at group one level , four of them now ending in victory			0
the ones that got away have included a nightmare passage when third to was in the 2012 oaks and two agonising defeats at the @entity87 ’ @entity88 , including having victory snatched away in the final stride by @entity18 in november , a reverse so hard to take @entity74 exited the @entity92 track in tears			2
it helped make yesterday ’s win so satisfying and @entity35 said : ‘ you have to believe in your horse and i did			0
too strong : @entity35 rides @entity3 to a shock win on day two at @entity99 ‘ they ca n’t win every time but wherever she has gone , she has performed with credit			2
i have ridden her from the start and she was probably the first good horse i ever rode			0
’ @entity10 had been training @entity3 for next week ’s @entity104 at the @entity105 only to change his mind when she blossomed			2
the trainer , who could go next to the @entity109 two weeks on saturday , said : ‘ it is marvellous bringing @entity2 here			2
i think she unbeatable over a mile and a half with cut in the ground in the autumn			0
we would n’t go near her then			0
hand it to him : @entity35 celebrates after riding @entity3 to victory in the @entity7 ‘ but i thought we had half a chance if we met her on mid-summer ground over a mile and a quarter			1
’ @entity10 , successful on day one with @entity123 in the @entity124 , also had @entity125 , length second to @entity128 ’s @entity127 in the @entity129			0
having started the day almost £ 200,000 behind @entity130 , he finished it nearly £ 100,000 in front in a see - sawing race for the trainers ’ title			0
@entity130 will not look back on the second day with fond memories			0
upset : @entity2 , ridden by @entity43 , was beaten into third by @entity3 and @entity18 he had warned his 2013 1,000 guineas and @entity141 winner @entity139 was short of peak fitness for the @entity143 and she crossed the line in fifth , never looking likely to land a punch on sir @entity147 - trained and @entity148 - ridden winner @entity149 , who set another track record			1
more painful was the neck defeat of @entity152 in a @entity153 won by well - backed 9 - 4 favourite @entity154			2
she was a second winner of the meeting for @entity159 trainer @entity158 , who will not now run his @entity162 winner @entity160 in saturday ’s @entity163 .			0

@entity25 **'s** horse @entity3 won the @entity166
favourite @entity2 was beaten into third with @entity18 second
@entity43 *blamed* the ground for @entity2 **'s** poor showing
