by @entity0 professor @entity1 claims fashionable celebrity diets - such as the 5:2 diet followed by @entity4 - are very similar to the eating habits of monks in the @entity7 fashionable fasting diets used by celebrities were actually invented by monks and hermits in the @entity7 , it has been revealed			1
there is a direct link between the 5:2 and @entity16 diets followed by stars such as @entity4 and @entity18 and the spiritual eating habits devised hundreds of years ago to cleanse the mind and body			1
@entity1 , @entity22 at @entity23 , is the author of ‘ a @entity24 ’ which has recipes from the @entity7 including stew and bread soup			2
the monks ’ healthy , simple diet and their fasting habits are almost exactly the same as today ’s celebrity weight loss plans , says the professor			1
the idea behind the 5:2 diet is to eat normally for five days , while fasting on the other two days			2
it is suggested that the dieter limits themself to 500 calories for two non-consecutive days a week			0
however , they are given a free reign on their choice of food for the other five days			2
some studies suggest fasting once or twice a week can also protect the brain against illnesses such as alzheimer ’s disease			0
the @entity50 off diet - follows a similar theory			0
the lecturer in @entity23 ’s @entity53 has produced a detailed look at fasting and diet in the @entity7			0
he believes the way the monks found , prepared and ate their food contains lessons that can - and are - being used in modern life			1
professor @entity1 said : ‘ hermits went out and found their food in the wild or grew it themselves			1
‘ in that respect they were very similar to some of today ’s chefs , like @entity70 , who use the same approach to prepare their dishes			1
he says the monks ' healthy , simple diet and their fasting habits are almost exactly the same as today 's celebrity weight loss plans			1
@entity18 is also thought to follow the 5:2 diet ‘ and of course , fasting played a major part in their lives			0
for them it was a spiritual act rather than a way to lose weight , but it made them very aware of the nature of food and eating			2
‘ as we have seen with recent dieting fads , we still look at fasting as a way of cleansing and improving our minds and our bodies			0
‘ there are great similarities between the hermits ’ and monks ’ diets and today ’s current trendy weight - loss regimes			2
modern day hermit ? professor @entity1 says that hermits foraged for food in the wild or grew it themselves - much like some of today 's chefs such as @entity70 ‘ the way they ate has a very modern dimension , and the superiority of home - grown and locally picked food is an argument they would have been very familiar with			1
‘ they would also be familiar with the debate over concerns over “ food miles ”			0
@entity123 and hermits gathered their food from nature			0
‘ they also recognised the virtue of a diet of simple food that needed little or no preparation			0

professor @entity1 says there 's a link between the 5:2 and @entity16 diets and eating habits devised hundreds of years ago to cleanse the mind
he says the way monks found and grew their food is similar to the *techniques* employed by celebrity chefs like @entity70
