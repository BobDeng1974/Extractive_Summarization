@entity1 holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate mobile phone ' roaming charges ' after @entity4 failed to scrap them as promised			1

@entity1 holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate ' roaming charges ' for using their mobile phones abroad but at a meeting in @entity4 , @entity6 governments tonight agreed to allow large mobile phone firms to continue levying extra charges on travellers for at least another three years , when the situation could be reviewed			1
governments said consumers should be given a small roaming allowance to use outside their home country from the middle of next year , but any usage above it should still be subject to further charges			2
the decision is a major blow to @entity1 tourists travelling to @entity36			0
a recent study showed that the average @entity1 person spends an extra £ 120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad			0
the issue of scrapping roaming charges has seen the @entity6 come head - to - head with the telecoms industry , who argue it will affect their revenues			1
tonight 's decision comes despite the @entity16 's decision to scrap roaming charges by the end of 2015 some members of the parliament immediately criticised the decision			1
the @entity53 said : ' the only winners from it are national telecoms operators themselves			0
member states should hang their heads in shame			0
' @entity36 consumer groups , speaking through an umbrella organisation , the @entity61 , condemned the plan as ' outrageous '			0
' roaming is not justifiable in a single market , ' they said			2
the member states must now agree a common position with both the @entity16 and @entity68 before changes take effect , so negotiations in the coming months are likely to be hard - fought			2
