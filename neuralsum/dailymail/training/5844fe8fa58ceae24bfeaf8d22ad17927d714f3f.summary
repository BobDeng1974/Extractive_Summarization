by @entity0 last updated at 8:39 am on 27th october 2011 rising tensions in @entity3 's parliament came to a head today as mps brawled - while controversial prime minister @entity6 frantically tried to convince @entity7 he could save the country from financial meltdown			1
the punch up erupted as mps from the @entity12 took on members of the opposition @entity14 - headed by @entity6 's former ally @entity15 who split with the sleazy 75 - year - old politician following his numerous sex scandals			1
the @entity18 saw red after @entity15 appeared on @entity3 tv to discuss @entity6 's proposed pension reforms , which he had agreed with @entity12 leader @entity21 - allegedly in return for the prime minister to step down in january and make way for elections			1
@entity42 accused @entity15 of ' scandalous behaviour ' and once he had finished speaking @entity28 of the @entity14 and @entity44 squared up to each other and started trading punches as colleagues dived in to pull them apart			0
at one point both men had grabbed each other by the throat as two other @entity11 also tried to join in and the brawl was eventually broken up by ushers and deputy speaker @entity55 was forced to suspend the session for several minutes until calm returned			0
boiling point : @entity28 , left , screams and goes for @entity29 , far right , through a sea of police the speaker was also forced to apologise to a group of children who were in parliament to see how mps worked and who had to hear the air turn blue as insults were traded as well as punches and she added : ' i 'm sorry you have had to see this very unedifying spectacle			1
' the fight took place as @entity6 travelled to @entity75 to assure @entity77 chiefs that he was working to balance @entity3 's book and that he would usher in reforms to promote economic growth in what is the third largest economy in the @entity82			2
@entity3 has a debt of more than Â£ 1trillion - or 120 % of its gdp - and there are real fears that it could head the same way as @entity90 and tumble into a financial abyss with @entity92 and others in @entity7 having to foot part of the bill for a bailout			0
@entity21 has steadfastly refused to make big concessions to @entity6 on the @entity12 's objections tochanging @entity3 's generous pension system as part of reforms demanded by @entity7 leaders but reports in @entity3 today said he had agreed if the prime minister resigned and held early elections			2
hands - off ! @entity29 , after being partially strangled , grabs the arms of @entity28 to defend himself broken - up : deputy speaker @entity55 suspended the sitting for several minutes after the fight , apparently caused by comments on television @entity6 is said to have persuaded the @entity12 , whose support he needs to keep his coalition government afloat , to accept a gradual increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 and in return the ' pact ' for him to step down by january was agreed , according to @entity3 newspaper reports			1
however the reports were denied by his spokesman @entity119 and by the @entity12 with one ally of @entity6 simply dismissing it as the ' usual theatre of politics that had no truth in it whatsoever ' insisting that he would stay on until elections scheduled for 2013			0
the punch up came as @entity6 travelled to @entity75 with a 15 page letter of intent which he said outlined his plans to save @entity3 and would give details of proposed growth and further explanation of his belt tightening 54 billion @entity133 austerity package introduced in the summer			0
however political commentators have said that the proposals are simply not enough and are simply ' ideas ' that have to be approved by parliament and are unlikely to get the go ahead as he has a slim working majority and ' will not be enough to assure @entity7 and the markets			0
