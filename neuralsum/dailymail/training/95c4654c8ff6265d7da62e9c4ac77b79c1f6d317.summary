by @entity0 last updated at 10:38 am on 31st october 2011 as the wars in @entity5 and @entity6 wind down , the number of people indicted and convicted by the @entity7 for bribery , theft and looting in both countries is rapidly rising , new reports have revealed			1
examples of crimes committed by @entity13 include a @entity14 in @entity5 who sent home $ 43,000 in stolen cash by hiding it in a footlocker among @entity7 flags			1
another soldier shipped thousands more concealed in a toy stuffed animal and an embassy employee tricked the @entity23 into wiring $ 240,000 into his foreign bank account			1
impact : some @entity7 troops in @entity5 have been involved in huge levels of fraud and looting sparking wide - scale investigations ( file picture ) prosecutors have retrieved some of the money			1
more than $ 83 million will be returned to the @entity7 from @entity5 cases completed in the budget year that ended sept. 30 , bringing the total recovered over the last seven years to nearly $ 155 million , @entity36 's office said			1
as well as stolen cash , the total includes court - ordered restitution , fines and proceeds from the sale of merchandise seized from those convicted , including @entity47 watches , luxury cars , plasma tvs and houses			2
' this is a boom industry for us , ' @entity36 , the special inspector general for @entity5 reconstruction , said as two government reports into the growing problem were released			1
' investigators and auditors had a productive quarter , ' said a report on the theft of @entity6 aid by @entity62 , who holds the same job for @entity6			2
his report covered august through october			2
in the past 13 months @entity7 investigators in @entity5 secured the indictments of 22 people for alleged aid - related offences , bringing to 69 the total since the @entity71 office was created in 2004			1
cruel : money earmarked for the reconstruction of @entity6 villages such as this one has apparently been diverted into the hands of contractors and military personnel several hundred more suspects are under scrutiny in 102 open investigations and those numbers are expected to climb			2
the rise in caseloads derives partly from spin - off investigations , where suspects facing prosecution lead investigators to other suspects , said @entity91 , @entity71 's assistant inspector general for investigations			2
' more and more people are ratting out their associates , ' he said , turning in conspirators who helped launder money after it was stolen , others who were aware of it and others implicated in the crimes			0
as investigators gain experience , they 're received better information from a growing network of sources in @entity5 , said @entity107 , @entity91 's deputy			1
development of an automated data - mining system for investigations has helped , he said , as did a decision two years ago to speed prosecutions by hiring three former assistant @entity7 attorneys and detailing them to the @entity114			0
at the inspector general 's office for @entity6 reconstruction , created in 2008 , officials report only nine indictments and seven convictions so far			0
re-establishing their country : @entity5 has become increasingly independent of the @entity7 and other countries but still relies on the aid that has been the subject of fraud they say they 're trying to ramp up after years of upheaval and charges the office was mismanaged			1
@entity62 was named acting inspector general after his predecessor left in august and is the third person to hold the job			0
still , @entity62 reported that during the last quarter , an investigation initiated by his office netted the largest bribery case in @entity6 's 10 - year war			1
a former @entity138 captain , @entity137 of @entity139 , @entity140 , was convicted , sentenced to prison and fined for soliciting $ 1.3 million in bribes from contractors working on reconstruction projects			1
most crimes uncovered by @entity7 investigators in the two war zones include bribery , kickbacks and theft , inspired in part by the deep and pervasive cultures of corruption indigenous to the countries themselves			0
among some of the cases listed in the reports were those of : gunnery sgt. @entity159 , who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in what prosecutors say was a scheme to help @entity5 contractors steal 70 generators that were meant to supply electricity for fellow @entity14			1
he sent some of their payments home in a footlocker and had other money wired , the report said			0
several @entity7 government employees , who received kickbacks for steering contracts to local conspirators and providing inside information to people competing for contracts			0
project : regeneration projects such as the @entity182 on the @entity183 in @entity182 , @entity5 , is an example of the type of scheme that is susceptible to exploitation a former army sergeant , who was not identified , is charged with pocketing more than $ 12,000 in cash that a contractor never picked up after the money was allegedly stolen by another army sergeant and mailed to @entity193 inside a stuffed animal			1
@entity195 national and @entity7 embassy employee @entity196 , who was convicted in april for stealing nearly $ 240,000 intended to cover shipping and customs charges the @entity23 incurs when it moves household goods of its employees			2
the money wound up in @entity196 's bank in @entity195			0
money stolen from reconstruction projects also has been shipped off of @entity7 battlefields tucked into letters home and stuffed in a military vest			0
tens of thousands of dollars were once sewn into a @entity210 suit			0
prosecutions by @entity62 's office recovered $ 51 million over the past year , his report said			1
the amount recovered is believed to be a tiny fraction of what 's been stolen in the two war zones , a figure that will probably never be known for certain			2
far more money is believed to have been lost through waste and abuse that resulted from poor management and the often - questioned @entity7 strategy of trying to rebuild nations that are still at war			0
the @entity7 has committed $ 62 billion to rebuilding @entity5 and $ 72 billion for the reconstruction of @entity6			1
the independent @entity228 estimated in august that at least $ 31 billion has been lost to waste and fraud in @entity5 and @entity6 , adding that the total could be as high as $ 60 billion			1
it studied not just reconstruction spending , but $ 206 billion for the logistical support of coalition forces and the performance of security functions			2
the commission found that from 10 to 20 percent of the $ 206 billion in spending was wasted , while fraud accounted for the loss of another 5 to 9 percent			2
@entity36 called the cost of fraud ' egregious '			0
' this is open crime occurring in a war zone , ' he said			0
' and the purpose of a lot of these expenditures is to win hearts and minds			0
obviously we lose hearts and minds " when local populations see foreigners steal money meant to help rebuild their country			0
the inspectors general are only two of the @entity7 government offices looking into fraud , waste and abuse			0
others include @entity23 inspectors and @entity138 criminal investigators .			0
