buffering videos and slow downloads are the bane of the web , even in areas that promise superfast speeds			0
but this could soon be a thing of the past after researchers created a network so fast - it could download a file in just 0.03 milliseconds			1
by comparison , the blink of an eye takes 300 milliseconds			0
the advanced technology uses fibre with seven different cores to transfer 255 terabits of data every second			1
researchers from @entity21 ( @entity21 ) have used a seven - core fibre network to transfer data at a record - high of 225 terabits per second ( @entity25 )			1
current fibre networks ( pictured ) typically use single cores and achieve a commercial maximum of @entity29 this is 2,550 times faster than the @entity29 currently offered as the maximum achievable speeds on single - core , commercial networks			1
and to put this into perspective , the average web speed globally is only a meagre @entity37			0
the advanced technology fibre uses seven different cores through which light can travel , instead of the single core typically used			1
during tests , its transferred 255 terabits of data every second			1
this is 2,550 times faster than the @entity46 offered as the current commercial maximum			1
put simply , it ’s similar to sending thousands of cars down a seven - lane motorway , compared to a single - track road			2
researchers also introduced two additional so - called ‘ orthogonal dimensions ’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane			2
the breakthrough was achieved by researchers from @entity21 ( @entity21 / e ) and the @entity60 ( @entity61 )			0
their new fibre has seven different cores through which the light can travel , instead of the single core typically used in current state - of - the - art fibre networks			1
put simply , it ’s the equivalent of sending thousands of cars down a seven - lane highway , compared to a single - track road			2
the researchers also introduced two additional so - called ‘ orthogonal dimensions ’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane			2
by combining these methods , the network topped out at @entity75			0
lead researcher , dr. @entity76 said : ‘ at less than 200 microns in diameter , this fibre does not take noticeably more space than conventional fibres already deployed			0
the advanced fibre uses seven cores ( pictured ) through which light can travel , instead of the single core typically used			1
researchers also introduced two so - called ‘ orthogonal dimensions ’			2
this is the equivalent to driving three cars on top of each other on a seven - lane motorway , compared to a single - track road ‘ these remarkable results definitely give the possibility to achieve @entity95 / s transmission			0
’ however , these speeds were the maximum achieved in controlled tests			0
to achieve such speeds in the real world would mean upgrading routers , devices and websites to handle the extra demand			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity107			0
these latest speeds build on the research from @entity110 which , in july , achieved @entity111 using the seven - core fibre .			1

researchers from @entity115 have developed a *multi-core* fibre network
it has seven cores , instead of the single core typically used to transfer data
network can transfer data at a record - high of 255 terabits per second ( @entity25 )
this is 2,550 times faster than the @entity46 limit on commercial networks
speeds *surpass* @entity111 reached by @entity110 in july
