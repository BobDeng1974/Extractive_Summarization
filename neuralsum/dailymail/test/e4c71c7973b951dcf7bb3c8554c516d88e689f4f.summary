@entity0 has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies , including faster methods of propulsion			1
other projects to be worked on include improved habitats for humans , and small satellites to explore deep space			1
and one of the companies in the 12 @entity14 ( @entity15 ) says they have an engine that could get humans to @entity18 in just 39 days			1
their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to @entity18 from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source			1
and following the successful test of a prototype in 2013 , it seems @entity0 is now considering it for use on a future mission to @entity18			1
short for @entity26 , @entity26 works with plasma , an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields			2
the magnetic field also insulates nearby structures so exhaust temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved			0
in rocket propulsion , the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases , the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency			0
plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins , so their fuel consumption is extremely low			0
‘ we are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with @entity0 in the final steps of the technology maturation , ’ said dr @entity66 , @entity31 ’s chairman and ceo , in a statement			1
‘ we look forward to a very successful partnership as we jointly advance the technology to flight readiness			0
’ over three years , @entity0 will give the company about £ 6.8 million ( $ 10 million ) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space			1
this will be achieved with a demonstration of their new prototype , the @entity80 , which will be able to fire continuously for more than 100 hours			0
a previous test in 2013 saw @entity31 complete 10,000 successful high power firings of a @entity26 prototype			1
however , this involved short duration bursts for less than a minute			0
proving the engine works for more than 100 hours will be key to it one day being used on a spacecraft			0
the @entity26 engine is seen here being tested			1
short for @entity26 , @entity26 works with plasma , an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields in rocket propulsion , the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases , the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency			2
plasma rockets like @entity26 ( illustrated ) feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins , so their fuel consumption is extremely low the @entity26 engine could be part of the entire spacecraft that will ultimately take astronauts to @entity18			1
the rocket that will send them on their way will be the space launch system , illustrated , which will complete an unmanned flight in 2019 - and it will have room for some secondary payloads to go to deep space owing to the orbits of @entity122 and @entity18 , there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			1
our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
for this reason spacecraft to @entity18 , such as the @entity131 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			2
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another			0
just getting there will take up to nine months			0
the astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back , again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years			0
whether an engine such as @entity26 could shorten the time it would take to cover the distance , though , remains to be seen			2
with this and other technologies , @entity0 said in a statement they want to develop exploration capabilities around the moon , and at @entity18			1
‘ commercial partners were selected for their technical ability to mature key technologies and their commitment to the potential applications both for government and private sector uses , ’ said @entity155 , associate administrator for @entity156 and operations at @entity158			0
‘ this work ultimately will inform the strategy to move human presence further into the solar system			0
’ three advanced electric propulsion projects , including @entity26 , will develop engines that operate in the 50 to 300 kilowatt range			1
by comparison , current electric propulsion used by @entity0 - such as the ion engine on the @entity175 - operates at less than five kilowatts			2
meanwhile , seven companies have been picked to work on the habitats that will house astronauts as they make their way to @entity18 in the 2030s			2
while the @entity184 capsule will take astronauts to and from @entity122 , it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days			0
to make the journey to @entity18 , expected to last anywhere from several months to three years , astronauts will need to live in some other structure			2
@entity0 will be hoping one of the projects it is funding will find a way to house the astronauts for the grueling journey to and from the red planet			2
while the @entity184 ( shown after test flight in december 2014 ) will take astronauts to and from @entity122 , it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days			0
to make the journey to @entity18 , expected to last anywhere from several months to three years , astronauts will need to live in some other structure previously , @entity204 outlined the six steps needed to land and return on @entity18 ( illustrated )			2
two are already in production - the @entity184 spacecraft and @entity209 rocket			0
the other four things needed are a large ' tug ' spacecraft , a habitat , lander and an ascent vehicle - all of which @entity0 is hoping to develop in the next decade or so @entity0 is also asking companies to development capabilities to sustain a crew of four for 60 days in cis - lunar space - between @entity122 and the moon - with the ability to scale up to @entity18 missions			1
the companies selected include @entity225 , who are creating an inflatable habitation module - a prototype of which will be attached to the @entity229 in 2018			0
and finally , two companies have been selected to develop small satellites - cubesats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of @entity0 ’s huge @entity209 rocket in 2019			1
as the rocket is so powerful , it will give these cubesats a rare opportunity to explore deep space , as opposed to remaining in @entity122 orbit			1
two companies have also been selected to develop small satellites - cubesats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of @entity0 ’s huge @entity209 rocket in 2019			1
it will give these cubesats a rare opportunity to explore deep space , as opposed to remaining in @entity122 orbit ( illustration shown )			1

company in @entity32 has been asked to develop its *revolutionary* engine
@entity31 *'s* @entity26 engine could apparently get to @entity18 in 39 days
it is one of 12 advanced technology projects to be funded by @entity0
others include new types of habitation and small deep space satellites
