by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 22 february 2013 when this empty @entity3 cruise ship disappeared into the mist en route to the @entity6 , it was thought the abandoned vessel could be lost to the ocean forever			1
but after spending almost two months adrift the ghostly liner is reported to have re-emerged near @entity11 's west coast - thousands of miles from its intended destination			1
the @entity14 - named after a famous @entity16 actress - was being towed to the @entity17 to be scrapped when the cable pulling it snapped , leaving the @entity14 to slip away as the crew on board the towing ship battled howling winds and 10ft waves to try in vain to reconnect the line			2
adrift : the empty @entity14 spent around two months drifting in the ocean before being spotted by a firm that uses satellite imagery to create maps for the @entity31 government all at sea : the ship was being towed to the @entity17 to be scrapped when it broke free the stranded liner , which had left @entity37 shores on january 23 , was later secured by the supply vessel @entity39 , but the ship drifted loose a second time , according to a report on the @entity44 website maritime authorities in @entity37 could not pinpoint the location of the ship , which has no warning lights and a broken global positioning system			1
but now a @entity31 intelligence agency has reported that the @entity14 was sighted 1,300 nautical miles from @entity11 's west coast			1
@entity37 's transport authority has said the abandoned ship is no longer its concern as the vessel has left the country 's waters , with officials insisting the owner of the @entity14 is responsible for its movements			2
a document from the @entity63 states that the @entity14 was spotted at the co-ordinates 49 - @entity64 and 044 - @entity65 , or roughly 1,300 miles from the @entity11 coast			0
the agency analyses satellite imagery and uses the results to create detailed maps for the @entity31 government			0
the empty liner is understood to be slowly drifting towards the @entity74 coastline			0
now home only to rats , the 1976 - built ship once carried passengers on @entity80 cruises			0
the ship was seized by authorities in @entity83 in 2010 amid spiralling debts owed to charter firm @entity85 after faults on board meant a scheduled cruise had to be cancelled			0
she is understood to have been sold to @entity90 in february last year to be broken up			0
