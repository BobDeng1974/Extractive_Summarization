by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 up of sickly sweet flavoured ice creams ? well , you 're in luck because the @entity7 ’s first savoury ice cream parlour opens in @entity8 this week and aims to offer a gourmet experience for those who like their summer snacks a little less ‘ vanilla ’			1
the pop - up promises to combine the @entity7 ’s favourite summer treat with a savoury twist - think blue cheese , cream cracker , ale and twiglet flavoured ice cream			1
sick of the sweet stuff ? a new savoury ice cream parlour is opening its doors in @entity8 this week - and smoked salmon , cream cracker and cheese flavoured ice cream is on the menu all the flavours on offer are made using @entity31 ’s savoury snacks , including @entity32 and @entity33 and , even better , they ’ll be free to all visitors			1
a spokesperson for @entity31 's , who are behind the concept , said : ' @entity37 is always looking for ways to bring its flavours to people in new ways , but i never thought i would see the day when we would be serving a @entity31 ’s @entity44 with ice cream			1
' having previewed the flavours during production i can guarantee that anyone who visits us is in for a real treat			0
' @entity51 ? the store , created by @entity37 , will use some of their snacks such as mini cheddars and even twiglets to create the savoury ice cream the store , which is located in @entity57 , will also crowdsource a flavour via suggestions made on @entity60			1
@entity62 ice creams are having a moment over in the @entity64 , where chorizo combined with caramel , and cherry - miso flavoured dessert is all the rage			1
' i like the marriage of salty and sweet and savoury and sweet , ' @entity71 of @entity72 in @entity73 told @entity75			2
' there is a large segment of people who want something new and exciting that they ’ve never had before or would have never thought possible in ice cream form , and i like challenging those people to try it			1
' @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , meanwhile , serves up a black raspberry and smoked ham flavour , as well as pear with blue cheese and goat cheese with habanero			2
bizarre : @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity93 , offer all sorts of savoury snacks , including @entity97 flavoured , left , and even foie gras , right ingredients @entity99 : @entity101 & @entity100 method 1			2
pour the cream , milk and sugar into a saucepan			2
bring slowly to the boil then remove from the heat and allow to cool a little			0
whisk together the salt and egg yolks in a large bowl until thoroughly combined			0
slowly pour the slightly cooled milk and cream onto the egg mixture , stirring constantly			2
do not use boiling milk as this can turn your egg mixture into scrambled eggs			0
pour the mixture back into the pan and slowly heat , stirring with a wooden spoon continuously , until it has reached @entity125 ( @entity126 )			0
add the cubed stilton to the saucepan and stir over a low to medium heat until it has all melted			0
taste and season with lemon juice and a little salt or pepper if necessary			0
cool down to @entity137 ( @entity138 ) within 90 minutes			0
to do this , either place the mix in a pan in a sink with cold water and ice cubes , or put the mix in a @entity147 bag inside a pan of cold water with ice cubes			0
pour the mixture into an ice - cream maker and churn			1
scoop the churned ice cream into a container and allow it to firm up a little before you start assembling your cream cracker sandwiches			1
once your ice cream is a little firmer , take it out of the freezer and scoop two generous tablespoons onto one @entity44 , season with a good twist of black pepper , and sandwich with a second @entity167			1
press down , and use a palette knife to smooth around the edges for a clean finish			0
have your packaging - either the plastic tub or some waxed paper - ready , and place each sandwich back in the freezer quickly to firm up before serving .			0
