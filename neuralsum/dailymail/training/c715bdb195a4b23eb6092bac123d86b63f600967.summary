under @entity2 's proposals , people aged 18 to 21 would have six months to find a job or training radical plans to ban young people getting the dole and slash the maximum amount of state benefits per household by £ 60 a week will be introduced if the @entity11 win next year ’s general election			1
@entity2 plans to use the savings to pay for three million apprenticeships for young workers and end youth unemployment			1
under the chancellor ’s proposals , people aged 18 to 21 would be given six months to find a job or training – after which their dole would be scrapped unless they agreed to take part in ‘ community projects ’ , such as cleaning up parks			1
in addition they will not be allowed to claim housing benefit , forcing more youngsters to live at home with their parents			0
attempts by mr @entity2 to introduce similar measures have been blocked by @entity35 deputy prime minister @entity34			1
but he will forge ahead if the @entity11 win power outright next may			0
in an interview with @entity39 , the chancellor said : ‘ our mission is not just to save the pounds here and there , we ’re trying to change the welfare system so it does n’t trap people in poverty and a culture of dependency			2
‘ it is a tragedy for them and a waste for the country			0
’ defending the housing benefit ban for under - 21s , he said : ‘ it is not acceptable for young people under the age of 21 to go straight from school on to benefits and into a home paid for through housing benefit – benefit funded by other people who are working			1
’ single parents and young people coming out of care and other ‘ vulnerable ’ groups would be exempt			1
and cutting dole for under - 21s would encourage more to find work and help abolish youth unemployment , he argued			2
‘ we are saying you will receive an allowance but if you ca n’t find work after six months , you will have to work for the dole			2
they are difficult decisions but the right ones			0

he believes it will encourage more people claiming benefits to find work			2
‘ before our reforms , some families were receiving £ 100,000 a year in housing benefit			0
how many working people can afford rent of £ 100,000 ? it was a gross injustice			0
since we imposed a cap , large numbers have looked for work			0
’ opinion polls consistently show large public support for tackling welfare abuse			2
however , @entity98 claim the new cuts are a ‘ fresh attack on the poor ’			1
a @entity98 aide said : ‘ the @entity11 are wrong to think they can win easy votes by attacking people on welfare			2
the bedroom tax is massively unpopular and now they are attacking young people			1
it is @entity2 ’s fault for not having policies to create jobs for them			0
’ the dole , officially called the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) is currently worth £ 50.95 per week for those aged 16 to 24 and £ 64.30 for the over- 25s			0
mr @entity2 intends to scrap the @entity123 for 18 to 21s and replace it with a ‘ youth allowance ’ – set at about the same level as the dole			2
but they will only receive it for six months			0
after that , if they have failed to find a job , apprenticeship or a training scheme , they will have to do community work , such as cleaning up public places , to continue receiving it			1
