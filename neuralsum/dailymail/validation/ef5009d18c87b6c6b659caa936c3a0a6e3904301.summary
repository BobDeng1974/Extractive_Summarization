scientists wanting to develop a spacecraft carrying a nuclear device to blow up asteroids are preparing to seek funding this year			1
called the @entity5 ( @entity6 ) , their system would be able to launch and reach an @entity8 - bound asteroid within 100 days or so , destroying it before it reached our planet			1
but the unmanned spacecraft relies on one crucial aspect - tracking and finding an asteroid , before it is too late to stop it impacting @entity8			1
in the diagram above , @entity21 stands for nuclear explosive device			2
the front of the spacecraft would create a small crater , which the nuclear device would then travel in to and explode the concept was created by the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , based in @entity19			1
they are seeking to find a way to protect @entity8 from destruction when all other methods have failed			1
ranging from £ 340 million to $ 1 billion ( $ 500 million to $ 1.5 billion ) , the cost of the mission would depend on how large the incoming asteroid that needed to be destroyed was			0
called the @entity39 , or @entity6 , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space			2
it consists of a fore body ( a leader spacecraft ) , which would hit the comet and create blast crater			0
a few seconds later , an aft body ( a follower spacecraft ) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times			1
once an asteroid had been located , the @entity6 would be launched on one of several possible rockets , including a @entity56 or @entity57 the @entity6 would then align itself such that it would impact the asteroid , by matching its orbit			2
the concept works using a ‘ leader ’ and a ‘ follower ’ spacecraft			0
after the launch , the former would separate and impact the asteroid , forming a crater in its surface			0
the follower , carrying a nuclear warhead , would then enter the crater and explode , blowing the asteroid to pieces			0
these pieces would either be deflected from @entity8 , or would be too small to cause any considerable damage			2
this diagram shows a simulation of the area affected if something the size of @entity81 , with a diameter of approximately 6.2 miles ( 10km ) , hit the @entity83 - a possible global extinction event this simulation shows the area that would be affected , if a medium asteroid 330ft ( 100 metres ) in diameter hit @entity89			0
the @entity30 team says there is a significant threat of an asteroid hitting @entity8 shown is a diagram of how the spacecraft might look , with the nuclear device in the middle			1
sensors at the front direct the spacecraft towards its target , before it impacts last year , the privately - funded @entity105 discovered that @entity8 is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought			1
while the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity113 and @entity112 , the danger was still ever - present			0
the findings were based on information released from the @entity116			0
this operates a network of sensors that monitor @entity8 around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations			2
but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale			0
between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on @entity8 ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts			2
it relies upon near - earth objects ( @entity134 ) being tracked , so that the threat of one hitting @entity8 can be measured in advance			2
if a potentially dangerous object is identified , the spacecraft can then be launched and sent on its mission to blow it up , before it has a chance to threaten @entity8			1
‘ the mission of preparing humanity for a potential asteroid collision is something that should have done a long time ago , ’ the team writes on their website			0
‘ we , as an advanced species , have had the basic technology for about half a century			0
‘ events like the one in @entity151 , in 2013 , could have been avoided if adequate detection and deflection missions had been developed			0
' launching a nuclear device into space may not be as easy as the team thinks , as there are a number of legal issues to do so			1
however , they say there are no safety issues with launching a nuclear device and , as the @entity6 will be hitting an asteroid so far into space , ‘ no nuclear material , radiation or shock wave will reach @entity8			1
’ they continued : ‘ legal complications or not , we do however believe that if , say , a sizeable asteroid is headed towards a city like @entity174 , @entity175 or @entity176 , we will as a team be able to gather the global support to get a mandate to act regardless of otherwise existing legal obstructions , if needed in order to save the lives of millions ! ’ and on whether it is illegal to send nuclear explosives into space , they said : ‘ probably not , as long as it is not a weapon			0
’ last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet			0
most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of @entity151 in @entity196 - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century on the left is a typical journey for the @entity6 vehicle to intercept an asteroid that could dangerous to @entity8			1
in this instance it would take 121 days to stop the asteroid before it hit , illustrated right in the 1998 movie @entity207 , pictured , @entity206 must save @entity8 from an asteroid by flying to the space rock and blowing it up with a bomb the team is now looking to raise £ 675,000 to £ 6.75 million ( $ 1 million to $ 10 million ) in the next year or so , through crowdfunding sites like @entity213			2
by 2018 , they want to build a version of @entity6 that could destroy an asteroid 165ft ( 50 metres ) across			0
and by the end of the decade , they want to be ready to stop asteroids up to 985ft ( 300 metres ) in size - which account for 99.9 per cent of asteroids near @entity8			1
they note that their method , using a nuclear device , should be considered a last resort and only used if other methods have failed			1
such methods could include hitting an asteroid with laser to deflect it , or rebounding solar rays into it to have the same effect			0
‘ however , in extreme cases with less than one year warning time and when all non-nuclear methods fail , we believe the @entity6 system is the only and most appropriate technique currently available to defend @entity8 , ’ the team said in a statement .			1

a @entity19 ngo is planning to develop @entity8 - saving spacecraft
@entity5 ( @entity6 ) will be a ' rapid ' *response*
it will blow up asteroids that could endanger @entity8 using a nuclear device
but this should only be a last resort when other methods have failed
