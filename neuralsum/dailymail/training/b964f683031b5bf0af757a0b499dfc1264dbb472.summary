by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:13 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 19:25 est , 1 january 2013 mothers with full - time jobs spend four months of the year working to cover their childcare costs , according to research			1
they must work for 17 weeks to raise enough money to pay the nursery or childminder as fees spiral			2
annual bills for a full - time place have reached £ 24,000 at the country ’s most expensive nurseries – on a par with the fees charged by prestigious boarding schools			1
mothers with a full - time job need to work for up to four months of the year just to break even on their childcare costs but growing numbers of women are accepting the mounting charges to bring in more money for their families as the cost of living rises and house prices remain high			1
research by trust fund provider @entity31 found families pay £ 7,127 a year on average for a full - time place at a day nursery or childminder for only one child			1
a mother would need to work for 17 weeks on average to break even and recoup these costs			1
but the analysis found sharp regional variations , with mothers in the @entity44 and @entity45 having to work the longest to cover their costs			1
those in the @entity44 pay £ 7,228 on average per year for childcare but earn £ 10.72 an hour , meaning they must work for 18.6 weeks to cover the charges			1
in the @entity45 , women must work for 17.9 weeks to break even			2
@entity53 @entity54 mothers living in the @entity54 tend to need to work for a week less a year than those living in the @entity57 to break even on their childcare costs although those in @entity61 face the highest annual childcare costs , at £ 9,283 per year on average , they also have the highest wages , earning £ 15.07 an hour , meaning they must work for 16.9 weeks to cover childcare			1
mothers in the south of @entity69 tend to have to work one week more than those in the north to recoup care costs – but those in @entity74 and @entity75 had to work for an above - average 17.7 weeks			1
@entity76 , of @entity31 , said : ‘ these figures highlight the very significant costs mums face if they choose to return to work after maternity leave and the fact that they will spend up to four months of the year simply working towards these costs			1
‘ mums can get up to 15 hours of care per week for free once their child turns three , but for the first couple of years parents must saddle these costs on their own			0
‘ what really jumps out from these figures is both the scale of the costs involved and the disparities in local affordability			0
’ the latest research is based on mothers who work a 36.3 hour week and receive no help from @entity99 schemes to help working parents , such as tax credits			2
it also assumed parents were not accepting childcare vouchers , which allow them to pay for childcare out of pre-tax wages			0
previous studies have found that working mothers in @entity108 face some of the highest childcare costs in the developed world			2
charities claim the tax and benefits system is skewed to make childcare costs a particular burden for middle - income families			0
the @entity116 revealed last month that , according to the latest census figures , the stay - at - home mother is becoming consigned to history			0
fewer than one in ten women of working age are stay - at - home mothers , down from 12 per cent in 2002 and a complete reversal on the 1970s , where most women with young families stayed at home			0
but a survey of new mothers by analyst @entity131 suggests the tide may be turning amid a lack of affordable childcare places			0
it found that the proportion of mothers deciding to stay at home rather than return to work has surged from 18 to 24 per cent in only a year			2
@entity142 , of @entity131 , said : ‘ affordability of childcare , or lack of , is keeping lower - income mums and those with more children at home			0
’ but she added that the rising cost of living continued to place women under enormous pressure to go back to work when their babies are very young			0
‘ job security is highly prized in the current climate of uncertainty with many mothers returning to work within the 12 months that their job has to be legally held open for them , ’ she said			0
the @entity160 has launched a commission , which is due to report soon , to recommend ways to overhaul the childcare system .			0

mothers in the @entity44 work on average 19 weeks a year before the cost of a childcare is covered
but only 15 weeks on average for those in the @entity53
average spend on a childcare by full - time mothers is £ 7,127 a year
