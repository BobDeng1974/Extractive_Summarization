@entity0 was accused of demeaning the office of speaker yesterday after publicly refusing to attend the funeral of @entity4			1
mrs @entity0 was invited to the ceremony at @entity6 only because she is the wife of @entity7 , who presided over the @entity9 debate celebrating the life of @entity4			1
but yesterday she said she would not go because she does not want to join in the ‘ attempted canonisation ’ of the late prime minister			0
speaking her mind : @entity0 , pictured with her husband , commons speaker @entity7 , will not be attending @entity4 's funeral mrs @entity0 , an outspoken @entity16 supporter , said : ‘ as commons speaker , @entity7 will be attending the funeral – and rightly so			1
but i ’m not obliged to participate in my husband ’s public life – last time i looked , this was the 21st century ! @entity7 holds public office and an important position , not me			2
‘ although i ’m genuinely sorry that @entity4 has passed away , i ’m not going to be a hypocrite and join in this attempted canonisation of her			0
’ mrs @entity0 also accused no 10 of leaking details of her decision not to go to the @entity29 to try to undermine her husband			2
she said : ‘ i ’m astonished that @entity32 ’s people have n’t got better things to do ! ' it ’s a predictably pathetic attempt to cause trouble for the speaker – which has utterly failed – and a complete non-story			0
@entity4 would n’t have given a monkey ’s whether or not i attended her funeral			0
’ grieving : sir @entity42 leaving his mother 's house in @entity45 , in @entity47 's @entity46 , today former prime minister @entity4 being comforted by her grandson @entity48 outside the memorial service of her late husband , sir @entity50 in 2003 friends and allies of @entity4 reacted with withering scorn to mrs @entity0 ’s attempt to grab the limelight			1
@entity57 mp @entity56 praised mr @entity7 for his handling of the commons debate but accused his wife of seeking to be the centre of attention			1
he said : ‘ i have to say this , @entity7 handled tuesday brilliantly			2
he got exactly the right tone			0
actually , @entity4 was a bit of a @entity66 fan			0
' as for @entity0 , there ’s the old saying : “ she wants to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral ”			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity4 was terribly interested in what she thought when she was alive			0
i do n’t think it will bother her in death that she is not at @entity6 ’s on wednesday			1
’ fellow @entity57 mp @entity78 said mrs @entity0 ’s views were ‘ utterly irrelevant to both @entity87 and the country ’ , adding : ‘ @entity4 is a colossal political figure whose place in history is assured – why anybody would care what the wife of the speaker thinks is beyond me			1
’ loyal aide : @entity4 and @entity90 , who has been invited to her funeral , in 2000 preparations are underway near @entity6 ahead of the funeral of @entity4 on the social networking site @entity96 , history researcher @entity95 wrote : ‘ mrs @entity0 will not be missed			1
her shallow self - publicising antics demean the speaker ’s office			0
’ mr @entity7 was last night presented with a new headache , as left - wing firebrand @entity102 vowed to disrupt the plans for the funeral			2
@entity105 yesterday said @entity106 will be cancelled on wednesday so that @entity107 can attend the funeral , but @entity109 mp mr @entity102 has said he will try to block the motion delaying the start of business to 2.30pm , after the funeral has taken place			2
ministers had hoped it would go through ‘ on the nod ’ tonight			0
but mr @entity102 says he will take advantage of @entity9 rules which mean that if one mp shouts ‘ object ’ , the motion will either have to be withdrawn , allowing @entity106 to go ahead as normal , or the government will have set aside time tomorrow so that it can be debated and voted on .			0
