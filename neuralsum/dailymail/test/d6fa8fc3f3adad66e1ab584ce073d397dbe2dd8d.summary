model behavior : @entity1 teacher @entity8 , 24 , was discovered on the f train in @entity1 and now juggles his career as an eighth - grade @entity15 teacher with a side job modelling for top designers ' i was taken aback and flattered , but also kind of incredulous , ' he told @entity33 of the encounter , which took place on the f train			2
' he was just like , " hey , you 're a model , right ? " i said , " noooo , i 'm a teacher , dude			0
" ' soon after , mr. @entity8 , who was at the time teaching a summer school course and standing to earn $ 45,530 in the coming school year , signed a modelling contract with @entity40 and started posing for designer lookbooks and walking in fashion shows in @entity43 and @entity44 under the name @entity46 , a pseudonym taken from his mother 's maiden name			1
but the hunky instructor insists that he does n't let his side job posing for @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 interfere with his responsibility to his students			0
classroom to catwalk : mr. @entity8 says his two jobs are similar in that they are both hectic and he needs to keep a straight face during each of them renaissance man : besides teaching and modelling , mr. @entity8 also speaks @entity67 , @entity68 , and @entity69 and composes his own music ' my agents have been pretty great about understanding that teaching is my priority , and they 've gotten me jobs that require me to miss little or no school , ' he said			2
' i did the @entity52 show — that was my first real show — over a weekend			0
i flew out to @entity43 on saturday evening , did the show , and then flew home immediately after ; so i was in @entity43 for 12 hours			0

male model : mr. @entity8 knows there 's more to life than being really , really , ridiculously good looking ; he also places a lot of importance on getting his @entity15 students to read ' i thought if people take interest in my story i could convert that interest into resources for my students , ' he told @entity105			1
mr. @entity8 launched a @entity106 - me campaign called @entity108 to raise funds to buy all 67 of his students new books , and the attention his plea received helped him quickly surpass his goal of $ 3,000 in donations			1
he is now urging would - be donors to help more teachers and students through fundraising website @entity120			0
