@entity1 's effort to identify potentially dangerous space rocks has taken a hit			1
the space agency 's inspector general has released a report blasting @entity1 's @entity8 program , which is meant to hunt and catalog comets , asteroids and relatively large fragments of these objects that pass within 28 million miles of @entity13			1
just one million of the program 's $ 40 million annual budget is spent on strategies to deflect an incoming asteroid or evacuate areas in danger of impact , said the report by @entity1 inspector general @entity22			1
for nearly a decade , the report noted , @entity1 has been tracking near - @entity13 objects bigger than 460 feet across			0
the goal was to catalog 90 percent by 2020			0
the space agency has discovered and plotted the orbits of more than 11,000 near - @entity13 objects since 1998 , an estimated 10 percent			1
it does not expect to meet the 2020 deadline			0
the purpose is to protect the planet against their potential dangers			0
most near - @entity13 objects harmlessly disintegrate before reaching @entity13 's surface			2
but there are exceptions , like the nearly 60 - foot meteor that exploded over @entity42 in 2013 , causing considerable damage			0
in a 44 - page report , inspector general @entity22 said the @entity8 program needs to be better organized and managed , with a bigger staff			2
' we believe the program would be more efficient , effective and transparent were it organized and managed in accordance with standard @entity1 research program requirements , ' it said			2
the report faulted the @entity54 's lack of structure , and said its resources are inadequate for handling its growing agenda			2
it said the program 's executive office fell short when it came to overseeing progress in the asteroid - tracking effort			1
there were no formal partnerships with the @entity68 or the @entity69 , or with international space agencies , it pointed out			1
those groups could make significant contributions to the effort , the report said			0
the ' lack of planning and resources has prevented the @entity54 from developing additional agreements that could help achieve program goals , ' it added			2
' for example , establishing formal partnerships with the @entity68 , the @entity69 , and international agencies could give the @entity54 access to additional @entity13 - based telescopes and thereby increase its ability to detect , track , and characterize a greater number of @entity8			1
the space agency has discovered and plotted the orbits of more than 11,000 near - @entity13 objects since 1998 , an estimated 10 percent @entity1 's science mission chief , former astronaut @entity92 , agreed and promised the problems will be fixed			1

it does not expect to meet the 2020 deadline			0
the program has insufficient oversight , @entity22 's office concluded , and no established milestones to track progress			1
in addition , @entity1 needs to do a better job of overseeing the various observatories searching for near - earth objects , and teaming up with other @entity110 and international agencies , the report said			1

no formal partnerships with the @entity68 , @entity69 , or international space agencies
