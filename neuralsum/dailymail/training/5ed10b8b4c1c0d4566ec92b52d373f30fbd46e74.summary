many women who check their breasts for cancer are doing so incorrectly , a leading doctor warned today			2
while many do n't bother at all , many of those who do take the time are still at risk due to not being thorough enough			0
speaking on @entity11 's @entity10 , dr @entity9 explained a monthly examination should take several minutes - much longer than the cursory swipe many women may perform in the shower			1
instructing how to perform a live examination on the @entity10 show , dr @entity9 explained a monthly check should take several minutes dr @entity9 told presenter @entity24 : ' the key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them			1
has anything changed ? that 's the vital thing ' to remind viewers what to do , and with the help of a female volunteer , he instructed how to perform a breast examination			1
when he did the same last year , it led to many women being diagnosed , including viewer @entity40			1

today , as he reminded viewers of the correct procedure , dr @entity9 told presenter @entity24 : ' the key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them			1
has anything changed ? that 's the vital thing			2
' he added : ' @entity53 in mind , periods will change things , so wait until a week after your period to check			0
' and remember one woman will have different consistency breasts compared to someone else - some have soft balloons , others lumpy beanbags			2
' you need to know what 's normal for you so you can detect change			2
after the menopause , for example , breasts become softer , less firm and less lumpy , ' he said			0
with the help of the model , @entity75 , dr @entity9 then proceeded to show viewers exactly how to perform a breast examination			1
@entity79 's guide to breast examination * stand with your hand on your hip to relax the muscles on that side of the chest * divide the breast tissue into four quadrants : a line across the nipple , a line through the nipple , one coming vertically across and all the way up to the collar and under the armpit			1
* using the soft pads of your three middle fingers , examine each quarter in a grid search			0
* it 's important to go all the way up to the collarbone and feel the lymph nodes under the armpit			2
around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant and the enlarged lymph glands are a sign			2
do n't just feel around the nipple and forget the armpit			0
* do a superficial feel on the surface first and then press deeper			0
* spend three minutes on each side , doing each quarter in turn , getting right into the tail of each breast			1
* when you come to the nipples , feel under the areola			0
* it 's also important to watch out for a rash or discharge , such as that which is milky , straw coloured or bleeding - and tell your doctor			1
* overall , watch for a change in the shape or contour of breasts - one may be asymmetrical compared to the other			2
* check for puckering or dimpling of the skin - perhaps because something is pulling underneath			0

around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant , dr @entity9 said @entity40 discovered a lump in her breast after watching a breast cancer examination last year @entity40 was watching @entity10 last year during @entity143 and realised she too had been checking herself incorrectly			1
after following the technique shown by dr @entity9 , she discovered a lump - and was diagnosed with cancer			1
speaking a year on , she said : ' i 've realised since then that many women - and men - do n't check their breasts at all , if properly			1
' after watching dr @entity9 , i used the technique he showed and found a large lump on my left - hand side			1
' two weeks later , she was diagnosed with cancer and has since gone through six months of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation therapy			0
now on the hormone drug @entity158 to prevent the cancer recurring , she said : ' i have daughters and i urge them and other people to check themselves			0
' we must be more aware - the amount of people who are n't [ is worrying ]			1
' however after treatment , she is on the road to recovery , and said today : ' i feel absolutely smashing			0
life is great at the minute			0
