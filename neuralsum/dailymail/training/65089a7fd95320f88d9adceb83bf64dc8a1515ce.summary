if @entity0 go on to lift the @entity2 trophy next may , very few will remember their opening group stage encounter at @entity5			1
spurs hustled a goalless draw in @entity9 but while it was without major incident on the pitch , the stalemate showed a rather unfamiliar robust performance from the north @entity14 outfit – one they will likely have to give again on the road to @entity17			0
@entity18 has never been a major problem for a @entity7 side on a consistent basis , but having the personnel in defence to soak up pressure under a hostile crowd has been found wanting all too often			1
the recipe was there for disaster in the group stage opener			0
@entity0 debutant @entity30 ( left ) and his centre half partner @entity31 were rocks at the back a brand new defensive partnership in @entity30 and @entity31 , 10 changes and key players being left at home were among the reasons why the 150 @entity7 fans which made the journey could have been left fearing the worst when the line - ups were announced			1
by contrast , the other more audible 90 per cent of the @entity42 were buoyed at hearing the full team confirmations come through the @entity46 system and the prospect of facing an under strength opposition			0
an interesting @entity9 heavy metal take on @entity51 ’s ‘ sailing ’ ( twice ) had already whipped the home crowd into a frenzy in the build up to the game , and the @entity0 players soon knew about it before a ball had even been kicked			0
whether it was playing a pass during the game , or strolling on to take part in the pre-match warm up , @entity7 were booed , whistled and jeered heavily throughout the night to almost deafening levels			2
regardless of the quality of the opposition @entity0 were up against , they were never going to stroll to an easy three points in this environment			0
maybe they could have had a go , and by have a go , i mean record a shot on target			0
but for all of @entity5 ’s overall control of the game – the home side very rarely gave @entity77 any tests to deal with in the @entity7 goal			1
@entity77 and @entity80 shake on it after a job well done against @entity5 in @entity9 there were moments where @entity0 nearly shot themselves in the foot			2
debutant @entity30 impressed but misjudged a first - half header to hand the hosts a chance , while a counter attack near the end of the opening 45 minutes brought a good save from @entity77 diving to his far post			0
but the combination of @entity30 and @entity80 at centre back had the majority of threats covered throughout the encounter , and gave fans genuine hope they can form a stable partnership at the back in the near future			0
a point away from home at @entity5 is a positive result for @entity7			1
manager @entity108 admitted post-match he picked a side to win , and even my @entity112 - supporting taxi driver ahead of the match was confident @entity0 would triumph 3 - 1 ( which if anything rather confirmed my suspicions he just hated @entity5 – which with a thumbs up and a smile , he acknowledged when i put it to him )			1
@entity119 ( right ) , also gave an assured display in difficult circumstances in @entity122 much like the @entity124 cliche of teams needing to perform on a wet tuesday night in @entity126 to show their worth , in @entity7 must be able to grind out results when factors outside their control mean they can not play their natural high pressing game on playing surfaces smother than a billiard table			0
regardless of the changes made to the squad , @entity7 will still be hoping to lift the @entity2 trophy more than any other cup competition this term – with the additional prize of @entity141 football going to the winner			2
drawing 0 - 0 is n’t going to make @entity143 step up and take note			1
but while @entity0 have always had a plan a in trying to outscore the other team , this particular stalemate shows that a more defensive @entity148 could be just what @entity7 need in their locker to go all the way in this competition			2
@entity108 insisted he picked a @entity7 side to win the match but settled for the hard - fought draw follow all the latest # @entity2 action on @entity157 and at @entity143			1

@entity0 drew 0 - 0 with @entity5 in @entity2
@entity7 soaked up pressure with @entity30 and @entity31 solid
@entity0 were jeered and booed by the @entity5 crowd
draw was a positive result for @entity108 *'s* side
