sale are confident that they can convince @entity1 to agree a new deal as the prospects of the fly - half moving on appear to be receding , at least for now			1
the 27 - year - old @entity6 no 10 contender is out of contract at the end of this season and he will be free to officially negotiate with other clubs from january 1			1
it has long been assumed that he craves a return to his roots in @entity14 , but it is understood @entity1 is happy in @entity15 and is keen to stay with the @entity16 if they can recruit well to enhance their hopes of becoming play - off challengers in the @entity19			1
@entity1 could sign a new deal with @entity16 in the coming weeks the @entity21 10 is preparing to take on @entity22 in the @entity24 clash on saturday earlier this year he was linked with a return to former club wasps but that door has now closed			1
they are preparing for a fresh start in @entity30 and @entity31 has learned that @entity34 stand - off @entity32 has agreed a move to the @entity36 next summer from @entity37 - coinciding with @entity39 ’s return to @entity40 from @entity41			1
while @entity43 have relocated to the @entity44 , @entity42 remain a prominent fixture in @entity14 but they will have former @entity48 fly - half @entity46 for another season , while @entity50 is well regarded - and well paid - as his understudy			1
in time , a switch to @entity53 may be an appealing proposition for @entity1 , but for now @entity42 ’ transfer - market priorities may be in other areas			2
@entity1 ( centre ) was dropped from @entity6 's squad for the @entity59 elsewhere in the @entity60 , @entity22 have @entity61 as an established , long - term playmaker and @entity63 do not have the title - chasing status that @entity1 craves			1
@entity66 are the other club who have been mentioned as potential suitors , but they have @entity69 , while @entity70 is a rising talent and both @entity72 and @entity73 can operate at @entity74			0
it is understood that , with @entity6 selection such a focus for him , @entity1 is not tempted by the notion of moving to @entity79 , where he could earn vast sums at a rich @entity83 club			1
instead , there is a chance that he may agree a one - year extension at @entity87 , with a view to considering their signings and outlook after the @entity92 , once the market settles down			1
ex-newcastle @entity94 fly half @entity32 is to join @entity43 next season , @entity31 understands @entity1 impressed for @entity6 during the summer tour of @entity48 and is looking to force his way back in asked about the progress of negotiations , @entity87 ’s director of rugby @entity100 said : ‘ we ’ve had a chat and we ’ll be taking the chat further			1
i ’ll go for a beer with him , discuss it and when the time is right he will agree or he wo n’t agree			0
it wo n’t come down to pounds , shillings and pence ; it will come down to our ambitions as a club			2
‘ we ’re targeting two or three very good players			0
two of them , we are meeting again this week – non-premiership players			0
@entity1 is enjoying himself up here and if i can match his ambition with a couple of signings , i do n’t see it as a problem			2
‘ the hunch at the moment is that he is dead happy here and we ’ll carry on the conversation in the next week or so			2
at the end of the win against @entity42 , the camera zoomed in on @entity1 and he did n’t look like a lad who is rushing to get to another club			2
’ @entity42 fly - half @entity46 is expected to remain at the club for another season @entity1 insisted that for now , his primary focus is on maintaining his impressive recent form			1
but when the time comes to make a decision about his future , it will come down to the quest for titles and trophies			0
‘ there ’s no rush for me at the moment , ’ he said			0
‘ you saw last year when there was all the speculation about @entity150 ( @entity70 - before move from @entity66 to @entity152 ) and that was difficult			2
if the club shows ambition and signs certain players , that ’s what i want to see and shows we ’re going in the right direction			0
‘ people all say we are fighting above ourselves , but if we add some class to that then the boys will start believing that top four is realistic			0
i do n’t play rugby to make up the numbers ; i want to be in the play - off games , that is my main focus			0
that is going to help my international ambitions and i ’m not going to stop having them			0
‘ i ’m not eager to get a move , i just want to make sure the team shows the right ambition then it is somewhere i would want to stay			0
you do grow fond of a place , but play - off rugby is what i want to be involved in			0
’ @entity61 is at @entity22 so that is not an option for @entity1 in the @entity60			1

@entity1 's *current* deal at @entity87 expire at end of the season
but @entity87 boss @entity100 is confident he will remain for another year
@entity1 is believed to want a return to the @entity60 in the long term
but in short - term he is happy in @entity15 if @entity87 match his ambitions
@entity1 will not move to @entity79 as he wants to get into @entity6 side
