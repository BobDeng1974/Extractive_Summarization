@entity1 midfielder @entity0 feels their dominant performance against @entity4 was further evidence of how much more comfortable they are in possession under @entity8			1
@entity1 needed an own goal to claim a 1 - 0 win in their opening home @entity14 qualifier but the scoreline did not reflect their superiority , particularly in the first half when they forced a number of corners and pressed the visitors back			1
although @entity4 improved after the break , @entity1 created far more opportunities and would have been more comfortable had they been more clinical in the final third			1
@entity27 missed two good chances and @entity29 forced a good late save			0
@entity0 scores the winning goal in @entity1 's 1 - 0 defeat of @entity4 at @entity32 @entity34 midfielder has credited coach @entity8 for introducing possession play to @entity1 @entity1 goalkeeper @entity36 did not have a save to make , although @entity4 sub @entity38 missed the target from 18 yards when presented with a decent chance in the final 15 minutes			1
for @entity0 , the display showed @entity1 are a team which is continuing to grow in confidence , with a further test to come on tuesday when they take on a @entity47 side fresh from victory over world champions @entity50			1
@entity0 , whose 27th - minute drive eventually went in off @entity52 , said : ' it 's something that we are not really known for , a nation that has a higher pass retention and more possession than the other team , but we are slowly trying to change that			1
' we are trying to change that throughout the age groups but the most important thing at the moment is the first team and the manager has been speaking about it for the last 12 months or so			0
' on saturday night it probably came to fruition but i think it will be a completely different game in @entity47 , i do n't think we will have as much of the ball as that , but it was certainly enjoyable			2
' in the last 10 minutes we could have probably kept the ball a bit better and maybe not attacked every time we got it , and seen the game out a little bit more comfortably			0
but maybe i 'm nit - picking			2
i think overall we have got to be pretty impressed with the first 70 minutes			0
' @entity0 is congratulated by a @entity1 fan after scoring his goal in the @entity79 qualifier @entity80 striker @entity27 was guilty of missing opportunities against @entity4 @entity1 's most recent qualifying campaign , for the @entity84 @entity83 , was undermined by a slow start when home draws with @entity87 and @entity88 put pressure on them and led to calls for manager @entity92 to be sacked			1
@entity92 survived for two more games but they were defeats in @entity95 and @entity96 which left @entity8 with an insurmountable task when he took over			2
given that painful experience , @entity0 was well aware how important winning the @entity32 encounter was			1
@entity1 players celebrate after the result that takes them third in their group ahead of @entity50 @entity1 moved above @entity50 on goal difference after the world champions were beaten by @entity47 ' it was a huge game for us to win , ' he said			2
' we have spoken about how well we have done in the last 18 months but now these games really matter , getting a home win was so important			0
' we saw it out in the last 10 minutes			0
we should have got at least a couple more so the last 10 minutes we re a little bit uncomfortable			0
' but it takes a little bit of pressure off us			0
the home games come with pressure from the fans and the expectations of trying to win your home games will transfer to @entity47			0
i think we 'll be tactically different and a little bit of pressure might come off us			0
' @entity1 have already won in @entity123 this year - @entity124 netting the only goal in a march friendly			1
@entity1 are likely to change their tactics for their next game against @entity130 's ( @entity129 ) @entity47 and previous away wins in @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity88 under @entity8 can give @entity1 confidence for tuesday night 's game , no matter how buoyant the hosts will be following their 2 - 0 victory over @entity50			1
@entity0 said : ' recently we have been pretty good away from home			2
the pace of ( @entity142 ) @entity141 has been huge and obviously @entity143 and ( @entity145 ) @entity144 , full - backs that pushed up on saturday			2
' it 's a huge advantage if you 've got pace in your side and at the minute we 've got that			0

@entity1 defeated @entity4 1 - 0 in their @entity79 qualifier on saturday
@entity0 scored the winning goal for the dominant @entity158
