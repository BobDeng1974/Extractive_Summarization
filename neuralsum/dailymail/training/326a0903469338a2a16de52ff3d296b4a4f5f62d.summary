men and women are happier in single sex offices because they are more comfortable without the other gender around , a new study claims			1
researchers found a higher level of contentment for men if they did not have to ‘ walk on eggshells ’ around women , while women were happier when not dealing with a ' testosterone - fulled atmosphere			2
' but the study revealed that , although they might prefer single sex offices , workers are actually more productive when they share their workplace with the other gender			1
study from the @entity16 claims men and women are happier in single sex offices			1
however they are more productive when sharing with the other gender ( stock image shown ) dr @entity19 , a senior economics lecturer at @entity16 , who co-authored the study , said : ‘ we all think that we want to be in this pluralistic society in a diverse setting			2
‘ but when push comes to shove , when our co-workers do n’t think like we do , that can cause some friction			0
‘ [ workers ] liked the idea of diversity more than they liked actual diversity ’			0
the researchers looked at a @entity35 employee survey from an unnamed @entity37 professional services company carried out between 1995 and 2002			1
more than half of women are bullied or harassed at work - often by members of their own sex , a major poll has revealed			0
based on interviews with nearly 23,000 women and more than 2,000 men , the survey is the largest of its kind in the @entity51			2
it revealed that the biggest enemy facing women in the office or other workplace is often other women , rather than their male colleagues			0
women who had been bullied by a member of their own sex said they felt they may have been targeted because their senior colleague felt threatened by their abilities			0
the firm had 60 offices around the world , some of which were men - only , and some were women - only			2
the survey measured cooperation , trust and work enjoyment , and the researchers cross-checked the data with figures on company revenue and diversity			0
overall , single sex offices reported being happier , but there was a twist when it came to company profits			1
the researchers found that if single sex offices had been mixed sex then revenue would have gone up by about 41 per cent			1
dr @entity85 , a @entity37 organisational development consultant , said that she was not surprised by the findings			0
she said men in particular found it harder with women around because they had to watch what they say , and that ' they feel like their equilibrium is being thrown off , and it ’s uncomfortable			2
dr @entity85 added that women by contrast ‘ feel like they have to be assertive to be heard , and then they get accused of being the " b " word			0
they get told that they ’re hard to work with			0
’ however , the research challenges the theory that happier workers are more productive			0
