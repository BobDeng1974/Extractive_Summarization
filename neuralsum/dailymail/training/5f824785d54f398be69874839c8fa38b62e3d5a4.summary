a study has found that men who regularly do housework , such as cooking and cleaning , have less sex than men who do n’t bother you may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman			1
but sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes wo n’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle - aged women at least			1
a study has found that men who regularly do housework , such as cooking and cleaning , have less sex than men who do n’t bother			2
researchers from the @entity21 in @entity22 studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle - aged @entity26 couples over 20 years , including their sex lives and how they divide household chores			1
the study , which was published in the journal @entity31 , found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women ’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females			2
the results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of ' masculine ' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn			0
while egalitarian marriages tended to be happier , men who did ‘ feminine ’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven			1
in fact , men who divorced themselves from core chores , had sex one and a half times more a month than those who pulled their weight in the home			2
overall , couples had sex once a week			0
@entity56 , a sociologist at the university , explained that gender stereotypes may linger in the home and could explain the results			1
‘ what we do in the house is really strongly tied to how people think of themselves as men or women or as masculine or feminine , ’ he told @entity61			2
he explained that women may see men doing ‘ feminine ’ jobs as less sexually attractive			1
alternatively , couples with similar roles may feel more like siblings than lovers , he added			0

a stock image is pictured dr @entity79 , a sociologist at the @entity80 , who has also written relationship books but was not involved in the study , said : ‘ that companionable part of the relationship turns out not to be so sexy			0
’ she believes that couples who share everything may be such good friends that they do n’t need sex to communicate			2
@entity88 , a sociologist at @entity89 in @entity90 cautions that the results may not apply to young couples who grew up in times when gender roles have largely changed			0
she found the opposite applied – that when tasks are not seen as gender specific , men have more sex when they do more housework and another study has backed up her claims			1
men who do more household chores ( stock image ) , are more satisfied in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘ manly ’ tasks , according to a 2013 study men who embrace their ' feminine side ' around the house have more satisfaction in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘ manly ’ chores like cutting the hedge and mowing the lawn , according to a 2013 study			1
the quality of the sex they had was superior as well if they were prepared to do their share of cooking and cleaning , the scientists found			0
the research by @entity124 contradicts the @entity80 study , but it used data on a similar number of families from 2006 , arguably showing that attitudes have changed			0
professor @entity130 said that using old data has skewed the @entity80 results because the couples had married in the 1960s and 70s when things were very different			0
she said : ‘ couples who shared domestic labour had sex at least as often , and were at least as satisfied with the frequency and quality of their sex , as couples where the woman did the bulk of the housework			0
‘ in fact , these egalitarian partners were ranked slightly higher in all these categories , reporting more frequent sex and greater satisfaction with the frequency and quality of that sex than conventional couples			0

researchers from the @entity21 in @entity22 studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle - aged @entity26 couples
they found men who do more traditionally ' feminine ' chores have less sex
it *suggests* that gender stereotypes linger in the home and that women may see men doing ‘ feminine ’ jobs as less sexually attractive
but a study looking at younger couples found the opposite is true
