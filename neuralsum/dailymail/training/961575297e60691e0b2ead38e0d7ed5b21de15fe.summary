click here to visit @entity2 's @entity1 when the battle was over and the points were delivered , @entity3 came careering down the touchline , blowing kisses and punching the air			1
for most of the unpredictable evening , his self - control had been impeccable , but now his inhibitions were cast aside , and it was impossible to blame him			0
in @entity3 ’s first @entity14 match as their manager , @entity12 had achieved the victory which had escaped them since november			1
and they had done it against a @entity21 side which so recently buried @entity22 beneath five goals			1
as one who played for the club , @entity3 knew precisely what it meant and how significant it might prove			1
hence his @entity30 parade from dugout to tunnel			0
later , he would try to place it in a saner perspective : ‘ one game … small steps … swallow does n’t make a summer			0
he took some pleasure in pointing out that @entity116 owner @entity115 had been the first person to text his congratulations after the match			1
but then , after @entity37 scored the late and priceless goal which lifted @entity12 beyond the bottom three , @entity3 took pleasure in everything			1
for everything which could go right had gone just perfectly			0
by contrast , @entity100 was suitably subdued			0
spurs had fallen short of their standards and paid a heavy price			0
moreover , they had conceded a genuine penalty , then been denied an equally genuine award			0
he correctly identified the penalty debate as the turning point , but had the class to remark : ‘ referees have a very difficult job			0
’ never a man to sell himself short , @entity3 set the tone with his programme notes : ‘ i ’d like to thank @entity139 and the @entity12 board for working so hard to get me here			1
’ his reception was a great deal warmer than anything he heard at @entity144			0
@entity21 passed the ball with greater confidence and moved with purpose in those opening stages , as befits a side coming off a momentous victory			1
but their chances were few , the football unconvincing			0
to their credit , @entity12 also passed it neatly , revealing little of the anxiety which must have attended their efforts			2
yet they conceded a gaping chance in 26 minutes , when @entity79 drove a low cross and , in the ensuing confusion , @entity88 managed improbably to hook the shot wide from four yards out			0
but an even more acceptable chance fell to @entity12 in 37 minutes , when the @entity21 back four left @entity68 absurdly alone , 15 yards out			1
@entity47 advanced , more in hope than expectation , and the flustered @entity68 drove the shot against the keeper ’s right knee			0
@entity3 looked fleetingly homicidal , and with some reason			2
@entity90 shoots to score @entity21 's first goal at @entity43 against @entity12 on saturday evening @entity90 runs away in celebration after scoring the opener between @entity12 and @entity21 at @entity176 @entity90 scored in front of @entity179 manager @entity178 , who was monitoring the @entity21 striker in the @entity14 game @entity90 scored yet again for @entity21 as the striker gave his side the lead at @entity43 in the @entity14 match @entity21 play from firm principles , building thoughtfully and refusing to resort to the witless launch			1
in @entity83 , they offer a midfielder of persistent strength and bewilderingly brilliant feet			0
but they could not devise a position from which @entity90 could reveal his form			2
that deficiency was remedied in 49 minutes , when @entity21 demonstrated the finishing which separates the best sides from the toilers			2
@entity89 rolled a ball to @entity90 20 yards out , and form asserted itself as the striker ’s low , impeccable drive brought the customary result			2
‘ he ’s one of our own , ’ sang the @entity21 contingent , and while the lead was gratefully accepted , it was barely deserved			1
by now , @entity21 were starting to exercise authority			2
@entity89 was producing genuine havoc with his surging runs , yet this was not a game to take for granted , for the 69th minute yielded another improbable turn			1
@entity63 hurried on to a short flick in the @entity21 area , and the hitherto excellent @entity83 stretched to the tackle and appeared to win the ball			2
the referee @entity102 gave the appeal an eternity of consideration , then jabbed a finger at the spot			0
there was pandemonium at the @entity12 as @entity44 simply battered the penalty			1
by now , we were prepared for anything			0
and so was @entity226 , the crucial goal was withheld until the 80th minute			1
palace substitute @entity228 attacked from the left with a mazily tenacious run			0
his pass enjoyed a fortunate break to @entity37 on the fringe of the area , and the drive was strong and precise			2
had justice prevailed , @entity63 ’s trip on @entity90 would have produced a second penalty and probable equality — both managers agreed that the claim was justified			1
but we sensed that @entity12 would escape , that the rare and precious victory would be their reward			2
and when @entity3 set off down the touchline , emoting like a leading lady , we knew we were right			0
@entity3 took charge of @entity12 for the first time in the @entity14 against @entity21 on saturday evening all eyes were on @entity3 for his first match as @entity12 manager in the @entity14 on saturday @entity3 appeals to the referee during the @entity14 match between @entity12 and @entity21 @entity3 celebrates during his first @entity14 match in charge of @entity12 at @entity43 @entity12 are in a relegation battle in the @entity14 and hope @entity3 can save them from going down to the championship @entity90 reacts during the @entity14 defeat ( left ) and applauds fans ( right ) as @entity21 lost 2 - 1 against @entity12 @entity21 debate with the officials after their 2 - 1 defeat against @entity12 as they feel it should not have been a penalty			1
