a new smartphone app that tests blood samples for hiv and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world , scientists claim			1
the software , developed by biomedical experts at @entity9 , analyses blood samples taken with a finger - prick dongle			1
the kit , which attaches to any smartphone or computer , replicates a lab test and can give a diagnosis in the field in just 15 minutes			1
the device is nearly 540 times cheaper than current lab testing machines , and has already been tested on patients in @entity21 during a pilot study			1
scientists at @entity9 have invented a new dongle that attaches to a mobile phone and can diagnose @entity3 and syphilis in 15 minutes			1
this means millions of lives could be saved through early diagnosis health workers tested the blood of 96 patients who were enrolling into clinics aimed at preventing transmission of @entity3 from mother to child , or those visiting voluntary counselling and testing centres			1
the dongle was developed to be small and light enough to fit in one hand			2
it draws its power from the smartphone allowing it to be used in remote areas , providing the phone is charged			1
@entity48 , associate professor of biomedical engineering at @entity9 , said the team 's work showed that full laboratory - quality tests can be run on a smartphone app. this makes a diagnosis accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones			2
' this kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world , ' he added			0
in the past , professor @entity48 's team has worked on creating miniature testing kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases			0
he said : ' we know that early diagnosis and treatment in pregnant mothers can greatly reduce adverse consequences to both them and their babies			0
' the new kits are expected to cost around £ 22.50 to manufacture , compared with the £ 12,150 cost of a standard lab testing machine			0
in @entity21 , healthcare workers were given 30 minutes of training and 97 per cent of patients said they would recommend the device			0
this was because of its fast turnaround time , ability to offer results for multiple diseases and the simplicity of procedure			0
the dongle , which plugs into any smartphone or computer , draws its energy from the device , allowing it to be used in remote areas			1
the team which created it estimate it will be 540 times cheaper than existing machines professor @entity48 said : ' our dongle presents new capabilities for a broad range of users , from health care providers to consumers			1
' by increasing detection of syphilis infections , we might be able to reduce deaths by 10-fold			0
' and for large - scale screening - where the dongle 's high sensitivity with few false negatives is critical - we might be able to scale up @entity3 testing at the community level with immediate antiretroviral therapy			2
' this could nearly stop @entity3 transmissions and approach elimination of this devastating disease			2
' we are really excited about the next steps in bringing this product to the market in developing countries			0
' and we are equally excited about exploring how this technology can benefit patients and consumers back home			0
' professor @entity48 's team 's work is published in @entity129 .			0

dongle that plugs into a smartphone or computer can diagnose @entity3 and syphilis within 15 minutes , say @entity9 scientists
kit replicates a lab test but is 540 times cheaper than existing *equipment*
takes its power from the phone or computers , meaning it can be used in remote areas and so could save millions of lives , experts claim
