by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 08:17 est , 15 march 2014 @entity4 drag queen @entity2 is already a prominent figure on the @entity6 circuit			1
the @entity12 @entity11 drag artist regularly appears on the cabaret and club scene and makes glamorous music videos , often with a comedy edge			2
' he added that the subject would be addressed in the next edition of the programme , which is made by @entity46 , the makers of @entity47			0
@entity2 , without his drag queen make - up , asked ' when will it be accepted to be gay and @entity4 ' the decision drew angry responses on social media from viewers of a show which boasts on its website of its determination not ignore taboo subjects or be censored			1
' @entity12 is a democracy where we can say what we want			0
so let ’s say it , ' is its slogan			0
@entity64 , of website @entity65 described it as ' an excellent example of how and why the @entity19 fails to do its job properly ' , while @entity70 , of the @entity71 , said : ' after agreeing to allow a programme called @entity20 to be filmed at the @entity21 , it is absurd and counterproductive to then censor the topic being discussed			1
' @entity75 in a video made for @entity19 in a statement , the @entity19 said : ' @entity19 ’s @entity20 is determined to discuss the issues that matter to its viewers			1
however , out of respect to the @entity21 , who hosted the programme , the decision was made to delay the debate on @entity4 gay rights to a future programme			2
the topic will be raised and debated in full in the edition of @entity20 airing on 25 march			2
' the debate will take place in a non-religious setting at the @entity94 estate in @entity95 , north @entity96			2
@entity97 wants to make a serious music video highlighting the issue of sexuality within @entity102 and black communities @entity97 appearing in the video that was played as part of his debate on @entity19 show free speech @entity2 is seen as a global pioneer among the ' @entity110 ' community and a highly visible role model for the new generation of @entity96 drag queens			1
he is also a proud @entity4 - and , unlike some , believes his lifestyle and religion are not incompatible			0
in an interview he told the @entity118 he is ' a self - proclaimed curry queen , performer , hostess and @entity122 , mixing together elements of my @entity102 background , @entity12 upbringing and uncanny flair for glamour and comedy			2
' a regular on on the cabaret and club circuit @entity75 is keen to raise the profile of @entity133 people within @entity102 and black communities ' i started going on the @entity96 club scene in my late teens and kept being called a curry queen which is slang for an @entity6 person of @entity102 descent			1
' ' at the time , i hated that term because i was n’t confident and had n’t reconciled my ethnicity and sexuality -- but the older i got , the more i embraced it			0
now i love being called a curry queen ! ' but @entity75 's main passion now ihighlighting the issue of sexuality in black and @entity102 communities , as he feels visibility of role models is low			1
' i believe we are lagging behind the rest of the world in this respect			0
in the @entity160 , black men like @entity158 and @entity159 are very visible to their peers			0
' ' however , i genuinely feel that in the @entity12 , despite living in both multicultural societies and having many human rights as @entity6 people , visibility is very poor			0
i would like to change that by showing that @entity6 people exist through my next music video and are n’t afraid of being visible			0
' @entity75 will debate the issue of being gay and @entity4 on the march 25th issue of @entity20 on the @entity19 @entity75 did appear on a pre-recorded video for the @entity19 show free speech music star : @entity75 performs in music videos which are often parodies or have a humorous theme			1
