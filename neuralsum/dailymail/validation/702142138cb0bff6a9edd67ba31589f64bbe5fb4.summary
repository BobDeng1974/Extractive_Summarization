the @entity1 @entity0 has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate			1
the church , which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest @entity9 denomination , made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change			2
its revised constitution will now read that marriage is ' a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , ' as opposed to just a man and woman previously			1
' there is still disagreement , and i do nâ€™t mean to minimize that , but i think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together			0
' the new language , which was approved by the church 's @entity48 last year , had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies			1
a grouping of congregations in the state of @entity54 became the 86th body to do just that tuesday			0
the decision is likely to drive a further wedge between presbyterian @entity0 members , who have taken opposite sides on the issue			0
the church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues			1
that being said , the fact that some many members who were against same - sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church			0
at last year 's @entity48 , the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed			1
' these decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others , ' @entity78 , stated clerk of the @entity48 , said at the time			0
the @entity32 ' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the @entity62 , the biggest single denomination among @entity1 , and fundamentalist evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage			2
in 2011 , the @entity0 voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy			2
the constitution 's new wording will take effect on june 21 .			0

after a debate that has lasted three decades , the @entity1 @entity0 has voted to define marriage to include gay and lesbian couples
its constitution will read that marriage is ' a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , ' not a man and woman
the new language , which was approved by the church 's @entity48 last year , had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies
many have left the fair of recent as it takes a more liberal stance on religious and social issues
the church still counts close to *2million* members
