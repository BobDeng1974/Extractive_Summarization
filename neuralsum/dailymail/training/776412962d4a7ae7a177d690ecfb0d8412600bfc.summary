the @entity1 military is hoping to develop hawk - like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air , but also fly through buildings			1
it hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour ( 20 metres per second ) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces			1
and , the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators , and without relying on @entity14			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of how the future drones could move the drones are being developed as part of its @entity26 ( @entity25 ) program , which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation			1
according to @entity30 , these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments , as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes			1
' @entity36 and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small @entity41 , ' said @entity42 , @entity30 program manager			1
' @entity44 , for example , can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree			2
many insects , too , can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision			2
' the goal of the @entity25 program is to explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small @entity41 the capacity to perform in a similar way , including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognise if it had already been in a room before			1
' if successful , the algorithms developed in the program could improve unmanned system capabilities by reducing the amount of processing power , communications , and human intervention needed			1
the initial focus is on @entity41 , but advances made through the @entity25 program could potentially be applied to ground , marine and underwater systems , according to @entity30 , these drones could help military teams patrolling dangerous environments			1
. ' @entity36 exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small @entity41 , ' said @entity30			1
' @entity44 , can fly very fast through a forest without smacking into a tree , for example			2
' @entity84 image of a goshawk is pictured this could be especially useful in environments where gps ca n't be used			1
' urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries , but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems , ' said @entity99 , director of @entity30 's @entity100			1
' by enabling unmanned systems to learn ' muscle memory ' and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles , it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission			0
' as well as developing the algorithms for these drones , the @entity112 is already testing designs			1
they have even built a pair of tiny robo - wings just 0.1 - inches ( 3mm ) long			1
the robo - fly spy : piezoelectric material in a wing built by @entity123 researchers allows a fruit - fly - sized micro-robot wing to flap with no motor ( pictured )			1
a dime is pictured to the right , to show scale it is a battle to send a drone supersonic - and pits @entity131 against @entity132			2
experts have claimed @entity131 's drone , called @entity135 , is under secret development			0
it was unveiled in 2006 at an airshow , but has since disappeared from public view			0
however , it has now reappeared in a report on the the website of the country 's national broadcaster cctv			0
the @entity135 - known in @entity131 as ' @entity145 ' - made its debut at the @entity147 in southern @entity131 's @entity149 province			2
the model was subsequently exhibited at the @entity151 - but was then never heard of again			2
some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons , while others believe the development of the drone is now being kept secret as it is undergoing further research and testing			2
@entity131 aviation expert @entity161 told @entity162 that while he does not know the status of the @entity135 project , the drone could become the world 's first supersonic uav if it proves a success			0
dr @entity168 and his team at the @entity170 , known as @entity123 , in @entity171 , @entity172 , said their wings can already fly			0
' we demonstrated that we can actually create lift , ' he said			0
' so we know this structure has the potential to fly			0
' the wings are made of lead zirconium titanate , referred to as @entity181			0
this material creates electric charge under an applied pressure or can create strain - such as motion - under an applied voltage , or electric field			0
they bend and flap when voltage is applied to the @entity181 material			0
the team have also designed sets of tiny robotic legs for a millipede - like robot that simulate crawling when voltage is applied to the @entity181 material			0
while the legs and wings are currently functional , dr @entity168 said it may take another 10 to 15 years of research and development to actually produce fully - functional robotic insects			1
for instance , algorithms are needed to simulate how a flying insect stabilises itself , he said			1
creating this type of artificial intelligence or ' cognitive ability ' will take time , explained dr @entity168			0
dr @entity210 , an electronics engineer at the @entity170 , part of the @entity212 , works with robotic systems that can navigate by using senses inspired by insects			1
a recently developed prototype , capable of wide - field vision , is something researchers hope to test at the manned and unmanned teaming , or @entity221 exercise at the @entity222 , @entity222 , @entity223			2
the wings bend and flap when voltage is applied to the @entity181 material - a material that creates electric charge under an applied pressure or can create strain , such as motion , under an applied voltage , or electric field the team have also designed sets of tiny robotic legs for a millipede - like robot that simulate crawling when voltage is applied to the @entity181 material this project will give us a chance to implement methods of perception such as @entity245 mapping and motion estimation on a robotics platform , dr @entity210 said			0
' the upcoming tests are a small example of a much larger effort , ' added @entity251 , collaborative alliance manager			0
' the university researchers across the consortium work with the @entity112 researchers to come up with systems that can provide soldier / robot teaming and be transitioned to industry			2
' the prototype is designed to help soldiers have tactical awareness at squad , and personal level , in a variety of environments			0
' if our prototype operates in the way it was designed to during these tests , it would be a technical win , ' dr @entity210 said			0
' but i would say the real goal of this exercise is to put the technology in the hands of soldiers , gather their feedback , and gain understanding about what will make autonomous systems more useful			0

@entity30 wants hawk and insect - style drones to be able to fly without gps
drones are being developed as part of @entity26 program
they could help military teams patrol dangerous indoor environments
as well as developing the algorithms for these drones , the @entity112 is already testing designs , including robo - insects
