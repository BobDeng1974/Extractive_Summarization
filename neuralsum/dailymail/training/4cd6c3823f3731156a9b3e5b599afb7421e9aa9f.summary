a strong smell of explosives hung in the air and the streets of @entity4 were eerily quiet as darkness fell tonight			1
gone were the normal sounds of traffic and of the city ’s one million residents going about their daily lives - the only noise was the distant rumble of war			0
for two days that ominous sound - of heavy shelling and gunfire - has been getting closer as the @entity17 military try to reclaim the key city from @entity20 separatists			1
during the day , a crucial railway bridge leaving the city was blown up , meaning thousands of people who flocked to the train station had to leave and return to their homes			1
as the airport has been destroyed by the @entity17 military , the only other option is by road - a highly dangerous route			1
today , journalists trying to leave were fired upon at military check points by drunken , kalashnikov - wielding , inexperienced rebels			1
like many others , myself and my colleague , photographer @entity47 , were trying to leave the city by train after reporting on the horrendous scenes at the @entity24 crash site and the shocking fact that the bodies of many victims have yet to be removed			2
at the station , one local woman told me : ‘ that would have been the last train out of here			2
i do not know what we will do now			0
a man looks at a destroyed bus station in the outskirts of @entity4 , eastern @entity17 , on friday			1
for two days the ominous sound of heavy shelling and gunfire has been getting closer to @entity4 as the @entity17 military try to reclaim the key city from @entity20 separatists the smashed windows of a house in the outskirts of @entity4 , in eastern @entity17 ‘ it is very dangerous to drive but we will try			1
’ i do not know when i will be able to leave and if i can find a driver willing to attempt to try			0
for now , the city ’s shops have been boarded up and both water and power supplies are failing			0
during the night , a crucial gas pipe was blown up and the cash machines have run dry			2
a curfew operates from 11pm to 6am and anyone caught breaching it carries the risk of arrest or worse			0
as i write , the fighting has moved closer into the city , on the roads by the airport and everyone has been told to stay inside and close their windows			2
but even with the doors and windows shut , the terrifying , booming sound of artillery can be clearly heard as the city of @entity4 comes closer each minute to descending into a state of full - blown war			1
@entity17 servicemen in the village of @entity104 , not far @entity105 , in the @entity4 region , on friday the government , embarrassed by its inability to secure the @entity24 crash site , is coming down hard on the rebels who formed the @entity30 five months ago			1
pictured are @entity17 servicemen in the village of @entity104 , not far @entity105 , in the @entity4 region @entity17 officials have today said their forces advanced to the outskirts of a key town north of the city as they try to retake the stronghold			1
the move comes as @entity17 forces appear to have gained some momentum recently by retaking control of territory from the rebels			1
@entity124 however also appears to becoming more involved in the fighting			0
the @entity126 and @entity17 have accused @entity127 of moving heavy artillery across the border to the rebels			1
@entity17 national security spokesman @entity131 said @entity17 forces were outside @entity132 , just north of the regional centre of @entity4			1
once they can take @entity137 , ' the direct route is open for the forces of the anti-terrorist operation to the capital of the @entity142 region - the city of @entity4 , ' @entity131 said			2
two military cargo planes , one @entity144 and the other @entity145 , today flew 38 more coffins carrying victims to the @entity144 for identification and investigation soldiers could be seen carrying coffins with the remains of the victims of @entity24 from a plane and into a waiting hearse at @entity157 military airport today ' the approaches to @entity4 are being blocked so that the terrorists do not get the chance to receive ammunition , reinforcements or equipment			1
' @entity4 , a city of about 1 million people , is a major centre of the separatist uprising that has battled @entity17 government forces for five months			1
@entity168 has joined calls for @entity124 to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 @entity172 as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of @entity177 flight @entity24 over eastern @entity17			2
the deputy prime minister said it was ' unthinkable ' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the @entity182 for supplying arms to the separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board			0
football 's world governing body @entity190 this week ruled out calls from some @entity193 politicians for @entity124 to be boycotted , insisting the tournament could be ' a force for good '			0
but mr @entity168 told @entity196 that allowing it to go ahead without a change of course by president @entity200 would make the world look ' so weak and so insincere ' in its condemnation of @entity127 's annexation of @entity204 and support for the rebels			0
meanwhile , a full - fledged investigation into the shooting down of @entity24 still has n't started because of the security risks posed by the nearby fighting			0
@entity126 and @entity17 officials say flight @entity212 was shot down by a missile from rebel territory , most likely by mistake			2

later , the @entity144 government said the first formal identification of a victim had taken place			0
the name and sex of the victim , a @entity144 national , were n't released			0
the planes took off from @entity231 , a government - controlled city where the bodies have been brought from the wreckage site in territory held by @entity20 separatists fighting the @entity17 government			1
they landed later in the afternoon in @entity157 , where the coffins were transferred to a fleet of hearses in a solemn ceremony			0
officials said the flights took the last of the 227 coffins containing victims that had been brought to @entity231 by refrigerated train			0
officials say the exact number of people held in the coffins is still to be determined by forensic experts in the @entity144 , where @entity17 agreed to send the bodies			0
international observers have said there are still remains at the wreckage site			0
access however has been limited due to rebel interference and security concerns .			0
