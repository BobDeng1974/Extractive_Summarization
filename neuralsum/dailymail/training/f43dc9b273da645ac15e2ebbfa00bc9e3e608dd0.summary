@entity0 failed to win for only the third time in the @entity3 season as @entity4 held @entity6 's men to a goalless draw at the @entity8			1
the draw sees @entity0 seven points clear at the top of the table ahead of @entity12 , who play third - placed @entity14 on sunday			1
@entity16 's @entity15 rated the players ' performances at the @entity8			2
@entity4 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity19 6 did n’t have a save of note to make as the big @entity21 made it back - to - back clean sheets			1
@entity23 7 one piece of showboating – taking out two @entity0 players – thrilled the home crowd and he clipped the bar in the first half			1
@entity30 7 great recovery to deny costa certain goal in first half			2
was resilient and kept @entity0 ’s main man quiet			1
@entity4 's @entity37 ( left ) snapped through challenges from the first minute until last @entity39 6.5 was part of admirable rearguard action as he and @entity42 used their experience to organise and repel the threat of the league leaders			1
@entity47 7 continues to impress since free - transfer arrival and looks a class act			2
@entity37 7.5 tigerish and snapped through challenges from the first minute until last			1
collects @entity51 on sunday night and , on this evidence , he is a worthy winner			2
@entity53 5 disappointed yet again			2
really has regressed as a footballer			0
no power or explosion left in his body			0
at 27 , it is a waste of a talented footballer			0
lucky not to be booked for early dive			0
@entity62 6.5 disciplined without being spectacular and played his part in gaining the point			0
@entity4 forward @entity65 was a constant menace against @entity0 @entity67 6.5 showing signs of improvement after sluggish start to season			1
nipped by opponents on couple of occasions and was strong in the tackle			0
@entity65 7 best attacking threat , escaping down the left on numerous occasions			1
was denied by @entity78 with stinging drive in second half			0
@entity81 6 afforded precious little of the ball but worked manfully before withdrawal midway through second half			0
was a handful and might have forced a winner late on			0
kept up the pressure on @entity0 midfield			2
@entity4 midfielder @entity67 was up for the challenge against @entity0 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity94 6 a spectator for the large part but did what he had to do with minimum fuss			1
@entity99 6 strong , as ever , but was outdone by @entity65 once or twice , but at no great cost			2
@entity101 6.5 one of his easier outings and , like the rest of the back four , watched on for the majority			0
@entity105 6 much like @entity107 , although @entity87 did cause him one or two problems late on			0
@entity108 6.5 had a comfortable evening against @entity53 and showed a willingness to join the attack when possible			0
@entity111 6.5 @entity112 through the game with a cigar from that deep - lying role but also tried to probe defence as game wore on			0
frustrated @entity0 striker @entity118 was fortunate to escape a red card @entity120 6 saw a lot of the ball but did little with it			1
just could not produce that killer pass			0
@entity125 5.5 ineffective and struggled to come up with anything to break down @entity4 resistance			1
@entity128 6 flattered to deceive at times when seeing a lot of the ball in and around the area , although , like his team - mates , he failed to penetrate			0
@entity135 7 was @entity0 ’s best bet for creating something in final third but his trickery ultimately came to nothing			1
@entity118 5.5 frustrating game and he was fortunate not to see red for a petulant first - half kick at @entity42			1

@entity37 was man of the match with top mark of 7.5
@entity65 ( 7 ) was @entity4 's main attacking threat
@entity0 's @entity118 looked off the pace and *awarded* just 5.5
