by @entity0 , @entity1 editor when high street stores first started selling bras in the 1920s they were more about providing upholstery than uplift			0
today , as the nation ’s men turn their minds to what to get their wives and girlfriends for @entity15 , many will be looking for something racy and lacy			0
new material released by the @entity19 gives a fascinating insight into how lingerie has moved from being functional , through comfortable , to the sort of skimpy patches of cloth that might make a pole dancer blush			2
racy : @entity27 is the face and body of @entity31 ' current glamorous lingerie campaign demure : @entity31 's first attempt at bra design was white and functional a lingerie collection by @entity27 is one of the few success stories for the @entity31 clothing range of recent years – and she certainly wears it well			1
however , generations of women of all shapes and sizes , not least @entity43 , have come to rely on @entity31 bras and knickers			1
@entity31 first began selling bras in 1926 with a simple , unstructured , white bra with delicate ribbon straps , while the only adornment was a tiny pink rose at the v of the cleavage			1
it was designed to suit the drop - waisted flapper style fashions that were the rage in the 1920s , as seen recently in @entity57 and the latest series of @entity59			0
the demure creation marked the start of a new chapter in @entity31 ’ history , which subsequently became famed for the quality and technology packed in to its lingerie			1
the first uplift bras were introduced in 1932 under the slogan ‘ a perfect figure guaranteed ’ , while the resourceful store made use of parachute silk in the 1940s to ensure no sagging in the morale of the nation ’s women			2
bizarrely , until the 1950s most bra retailers failed to recognise that women came in different shapes and sizes and produced bras in just one cup size			1
in 1951 , @entity31 took the bold stance of introducing three - small , medium , large – and by 1953 the chain was selling some 125,000 a week			1
glamorous : different sizes first arrived in the 1950s and bras could be bought in small , medium and large advanced : the first nylon smalls arrived in the 1960s , as did the first wash - and - wear styles 1970s style : @entity95 sizes were introduced at the beginning of the decade as was the bikini knicker the idea of the bra as a fashion statement emerged in the 1950s and @entity31 began offering a range with embroidered shoulder straps , which might be occasionally peak out from beneath a dress , in 1955			1
further innovation brought the first front - fastening bras in 1958			0
advances in technology and the arrival of man - made fibres like nylon in the swinging 1960s allowed new innovations			0
in 1960 , a lightweight range of easy to wash and dry bras , suspender belts and panty girdles became available			0
and in 1965 , the first sheer nylon bra was introduced			2
as @entity119 were winning the @entity95 in 1966 @entity31 was winning its own high street battle with luxury bras including lace option in white , pink and blue			1
the range outsold all others			0
while 1969 brought relief to women struggling with ill - fitting bras with the introduction of cup sizes @entity130			2
daring : knitted nylon and fine knitted cotton meant that more delicate , racier styles could be introduced cheap chic : the first ever 99p bra was launched at @entity31 in 1978 the 1970s may not be renowned for its trend - setting fashions and style , however there was a revolution going on in stores and underwear drawers			1
the hot summer of 1976 coincided with the launch of matching tiny bra and bikini brief sets in knitted nylon or fine knitted cotton , while 1978 brought the 99p bra , a front fastening plunge option made from nylon			0
the idea of putting lingerie on display was something most retailers shied away from for decades , fearing embarrassment among customers , particularly men who were wandering through			0
in took until 1984 for @entity31 to start displaying its ‘ feathers ’ range on hangers rather than the traditional boxed packs on shelves			1
the 1990s was dominated by the launch of practical designs			0
there was the first ‘ mum to be ’ collection , washable underwired bras and the first silk options which could be put in a washing machine			0
practical : while the 1970s saw glamour increase , @entity31 always kept a more practical selection in stock inspiration : modern smalls such as those by @entity27 take inspiration from the ' 20s the first t - shirt bra arrived in 1997 , a time when fitness work - outs and jogging became part of the daily routine for millions of women			1
in 2000 , the @entity190 range was introduced and went on to win the @entity191			0
the technology was fitted to t - shirts , tops and swimwear and allowed women to go without a bra at all			2
today , the new collection by @entity27 consists of luxury lingerie sets and takes just a little inspiration from the time when @entity31 sold its first bras with 1920s inspired rose prints			1
the 26 - year - old @entity206 model and actress has proved to have something of a @entity209 with any products she is associated with , whether it is @entity31 or @entity213			2
at the same time , any prudishness that restricted the promotion , advertising and display of lingerie in the past has gone for good			0
the chain now promotes its ranges with video posters , moving billboards , that show the young actress turning and posing in front of a mirror wearing very little but a pout			0
the lingerie sold by the chain through the years is being displayed at the store ’s marks in @entity233 exhibition in @entity234 ahead of @entity15 .			1

@entity31 sold its first bra , a white and functional affair , in 1926
generations of women , including @entity43 , have worn @entity31
most recent addition is @entity27 's glamorous collection
