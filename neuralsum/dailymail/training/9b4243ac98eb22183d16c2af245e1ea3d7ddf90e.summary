@entity2 governor @entity1 plans to ban fracking in the state , officials announced today			1
at a press conference on wednesday , state health and environmental officials citing unresolved health issues and dubious economic benefits for the reason for the ban			1
fracking , also known as hydraulic fracturing , uses a mixture of high - pressured water , sand and chemicals to tap into natural gas reserves in the rock , and at the press conference , the officials pointed out studies questioning the long - term safety of the process			2
@entity2 , which sits on part of a rock formation rich in gas , has banned shale gas development since the state began its environmental review in 2008			1
wednesday 's announcement , though not final , means a ban is all but etched in stone - and environmentalists are thrilled			1
his administration will move to prohibit fracking in the state , citing unresolved health issues and dubious economic benefits ' never before has a state with proven gas reserves banned fracking , ' said @entity40 , an attorney with @entity41 , adding that the decision ' will give courage to elected leaders throughout the country and world : fracking is too dangerous and must not continue			1
' industry representatives expressed disappointment but also have downplayed @entity2 's potential as a major source of natural gas			2
' we are very disappointed that it appears the governor is unwilling to be a leader and is going to pass the buck at the expense of @entity58 , ' said @entity59 , president of the @entity60			1
' this technology has been used for over 65 years in the @entity62			0
it 's been demonstrated repeatedly after drilling millions of wells that we 're able to do it while protecting the environment and protecting the people			0
' environmental commissioner @entity70 said on wednesday that he was recommending a ban , and @entity1 , a @entity72 , said he would defer to @entity70 and acting health commissioner @entity73 on the decision			1
the @entity75 will put out a final environmental impact statement early next year , @entity70 said , and after that he 'll issue an order prohibiting fracking			2
@entity73 and @entity70 on wednesday summarized environmental and health reviews that concluded fracking carried risks that have n't been studied enough			1

the drilling boom in the @entity106 , a rock formation underlying southern @entity2 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , was made possible by fracking on a massive scale			0
the technique has generated tens of billions of dollars in industry profits and landowner royalties , and has reduced energy bills and fuel imports			2
but it has also brought concerns and sparked protests over air and water pollution , earthquakes , property devaluation , and truck traffic			0
at the meeting on wednesday , health officials said they had identified ' significant public health risks ' that require long - term studies before fracking can be called safe			1
environmental officials noted the low price of natural gas and the high local cost of industry oversight			1

@entity73 said he had identified ' significant public health risks ' and ' red flag ' health issues that require long - term studies before fracking can be called safe			1
he likened fracking to secondhand smoke , which was n't fully understood as a health risk until many years of scientific study were done			0
@entity70 noted the low price of natural gas , the high local cost of industry oversight , and the large areas that would be off limits to shale gas development because of setback requirements , water supply protections and local prohibitions			0
those factors , he said , combine to make fracking less economically beneficial than anticipated			0
even if drilling were allowed in @entity2 , it would n't likely take off anytime soon because of the uncertainty around regulations and legal challenges , and the huge amount of promising drilling locations that remain in fracking - friendly neighbor @entity108 , said @entity176 , president of the industry group @entity177			0

environmentalists have expressed their joy at the state 's decision the location of the rock entices producers because of its proximity to the major demand centers of @entity58 and @entity192 , which is paying more for gas because of delivery constraints			1
but the uncertainty remains too high to commit			0
in states where fracking is not yet allowed or is happening but subject to criticism , @entity2 's move excited some anti-drilling activists			0
' the more fracking expands , the more opposition grows , ' said @entity203 , of the group @entity204 , who has organized anti-fracking activists in @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
' @entity209 is its own worst enemy because they continue to deny the impacts			0
' fracking supporters decried the @entity2 move			0
@entity215 , executive director of @entity2 's branch of the @entity60 , said the @entity1 administration is denying landowners the right to develop their mineral resources			2
' the secretary of energy , the @entity62 @entity223 administrator and president @entity224 recognize the benefits of fracking , and yet the @entity1 administration simply did not want to anger their activist base , ' @entity221 said			1
@entity1 said he is anticipating lawsuits being filed ' every which way from sunday			2
