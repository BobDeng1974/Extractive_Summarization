the widespread adoption of autonomous cars – which is predicted to happen within just 15 years – could lead to the death of railways , one expert claims			1
the damning prediction comes at a time when governments around the world are planning on ploughing billions into high speed rail projects , such as @entity10 in @entity11			1
one @entity13 expert thinks the investments could be made in vain , because the lure of self - driving cars , which could transport people in comfort to any location with minimal effort , will outweigh the appeal of high speed railway lines			1
the widespread adoption of autonomous cars – which is predicted to happen in just 15 years ’ time – could lead to the death of railways , one expert claims this is despite the expected roll - out of high speed rail networks such as @entity10 in the @entity11			1
a hub station in @entity30 is illustrated futurologists predict that autonomous vehicles will be commonplace on roads in @entity34 and the @entity13 in just 15 years ’ time , as companies such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 work on self - driving technology			1
a report by @entity42 predicts that the autonomous car market will be worth $ 87 billion by 2030 , while the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) in @entity45 thinks self - driving vehicles will make up 75 per cent of vehicles on the road by 2040			1
@entity50 , a senior fellow of the libertarian @entity51 in @entity52 , says that they will offer a compelling alternative to high speed rail links for distances of 200 miles ( 322km ) , rendering some high speed train lines obsolete , @entity49 reported			1
one of the lines that could potentially be affected is the high - speed 2 ( @entity10 )			1
the line , which is in the planning stage , would run between @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 and would cost £ 42.6billion ( $ 68.6billion )			0
@entity11 is not the only country with high speed rail ambitions			1
there are also plans for a high speed rail link in @entity68 stretching from @entity69 to @entity70 , which could cost $ 114 @entity71 ( £ 62.5billion )			1

@entity37 's car is pictured			0
the expert thinks that the comfort of travelling in such as car will outweigh the speed of trains the prime minister has backed plans for a high speed @entity86 rail link in the north of @entity89 , the @entity82 reported			1
the government plans to put a strategy together looking at options and costs which is set to be released in march			0
the route would connect @entity95 with @entity96 , @entity45 and @entity63 , with another branch running west - to east , from @entity98 via @entity99 to @entity100 and to @entity63 and @entity101			0
mr @entity102 said that improving connectivity and cutting journey times is ' crucial ' to its long - term economic plan for the north of @entity89			0
the @entity108 government is said to be interested in building a high speed network , while the @entity110 has been researching new high - speed rail systems based on magnetic levitation since the 1970s , with plans to build a new route connecting @entity115 with @entity116 in 2025			1
in @entity11 , @entity10 would be completed in around 2030 if it goes ahead , and would therefore be competing with autonomous cars , mr @entity50 said			1
while high speed trains could carry passengers at up to 250mph ( 402kph ) , they would still have to get to a station to begin their journey			1
however , passengers in self - driving cars could enter their destination and be driven door - to - door , while working or watching films at around 100mph ( 161kph )			1
mr @entity129 explained that in the travel industry , there is a general wisdom that there is a ‘ sweet spot ’ for distances , where high speed rail travel looks more compelling than flying and driving			2
it says that trips shorter than 100 miles ( 161km ) are best made by car and more than 600 miles ( 966km ) by aeroplane , leaving distances in between , perfect for high speed rail			2
but mr @entity50 said : ‘ i am dubious that such a sweet spot exists			2
many people are willing to drive hundreds of miles in order to have the convenience of their car when they get to their destinations , while flying is practical enough for trips of 150 miles or so that airlines currently offer 30 flights a day between @entity154 and @entity156 airports , which are 161 driving miles apart			0
’ ‘ even if such a sweet spot exists today , self - driving cars will make it even less viable because they will change the way we look at travel time			2
he claims that if passengers can get on with work or be entertained in their cars , they will be willing to spend more time in them			0
‘ that means the 100 miles that is supposedly the range in which cars have a competitive advantage will easily increase to 200 miles or more , ’ he said			0
mr @entity129 believes that self - driving cars will transform the 21st century , just as cars changed the 20th century			2
self - driving vehicles as well as new taxi and car - sharing apps like @entity175 could lead to the death of less flexible and reliable modes of transportation , such as trains , he added			1
however , trains may thrive for some time yet , because current autonomous cars are facing teething problems			1
@entity37 ’s self - driving cars ca n’t currently cope in heavy rain or snow – or find their way around 99 per cent of the @entity13			2
according to @entity188 , the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n’t react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards			0
@entity193 , director of the @entity37 car team , said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions			0
while the cars ’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing , they can be confused by strong sunlight			0
despite the cars being allowed on public roads , they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver , because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car can not deviate from its route			0
an area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways , in order to make the cars ' routes - something that will probably have to change if self - driving cars are adopted all over the world			2
this graphic reveals how @entity37 's prototype driverless car looks and works			0
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			1
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing			2
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity193 , the leader of @entity37 's self - driving car team			0
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100miles ( 160km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity261 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40kph ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity37 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			2
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity37 's extended maps service			0
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			0

@entity50 , of the libertarian @entity51 in @entity52 , thinks *commuters* will choose autonomous cars over high - speed trains in 2030
technology is predicted to feature in lots of cars in the next 15 years and mean journeys could be used for working and watching films , for example
he thinks such vehicles could be the death of the railways - even if billions of pounds are invested on faster lines across the world
his prediction makes *arguably* plans for @entity10 and @entity327 in the @entity11
