@entity1 's prime minister has had an audience with @entity3 , amid fears @entity5 will no longer rescue his country 's ailing economy			1
@entity8 met the @entity10 president in @entity11 yesterday and the pair agreed a package of investment in energy and other projects			1
but mr @entity8 insisted he had not asked for – or received – financial aid , saying @entity1 is a ' sovereign nation ' and ' not a debt colony '			1
meeting : @entity1 's prime minister met @entity3 yesterday and struck potential deals over investment in energy and other projects			1
it was expected mr @entity8 ( left ) would ask mr @entity3 ( right ) for a hand - out @entity1 's government , the most left - wing ever elected in @entity5 , has been handed a list of reforms it must carry out in return for a new injection of cash from @entity30 countries			1
propped up by some £ 175billion of aid from @entity5 and the @entity32 since 2010 , @entity1 has not received bailout funds since @entity34 took power in january , and could run out of money within weeks			2
it was expected mr @entity8 would ask mr @entity3 for a hand - out - despite @entity10 's economy also suffering deeply under @entity40 and @entity41 sanctions imposed after the invasion of @entity43			1
but instead the meeting saw a commitment to restore trade between the two countries , which had been significant before both were hit by economic woes			0
the @entity1 prime minister said , defending his visit : ' @entity1 is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy			1
' @entity1 is not a beggar to go around all the countries asking them to help resolve its financial problems			2
' he said he would not be thrown ' off the boat ' by the @entity30 , saying : ' we are equal passengers			0
there is no higher or lower deck			0
we are not a debt colony , we have the same rights as other countries have			0
' moving forward : mr @entity3 ( right , with mr @entity8 ) said @entity10 could also provide loans for projects including a gas pipeline via @entity68 , which was shelved last year as relations between @entity11 and the @entity70 deteriorated mr @entity3 said the leaders had discussed ' various ways of co-operating , including major projects in energy ' and said @entity10 ' could provide loans ' for projects including a potential gas pipeline via @entity68 , which was shelved last year amid deteriorating relations between mr @entity3 and the @entity70			1
' this is not about aid but about financial cooperation in major projects …			0
of course we are interested in pipelines , ports , and airports , as well as energy generation and other resources ' , mr @entity3 said			0
@entity88 of the agenda were restoring @entity1 's exports of food – such as vegetables and cheese - which stopped after @entity11 slapped an embargo on them , in response to @entity70 sanctions			2
mr @entity3 suggested this could be lifted , restore the livelihoods of @entity1 farmers			2
experts said @entity1 could get a discount on gas – most of which it imports from @entity10			0
it is thought mr @entity8 intended to ratchet up the pressure on his @entity5 creditors particularly @entity106 , to draw him away from mr @entity3 's sphere of influence			2
a @entity1 repayment of around £ 325million is due today			0
@entity1 claims @entity106 owes them many times this sum in reparations for the @entity114 invasion for which they were not sufficiently compensated .			0
