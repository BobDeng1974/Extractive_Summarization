by @entity0 , political correspondent last updated at 2:48 am on 10th september 2011 @entity1 managing director @entity2 arrives for a meeting of the @entity5 finance ministers in @entity6 @entity7 yesterday dismissed calls for him to change course on the economy – as he insisted that his deficit reduction plan is the ‘ rock of stability ’ for @entity14 ’s recovery			1
the chancellor held fast to his view that the government ’s plans were flexible enough to deal with a deteriorating economic situation			0
mr @entity7 received the backing of @entity1 head @entity2 , who said @entity14 ’s plans remained ‘ appropriate ’			1
but she added that spending cuts could tip @entity14 back into recession if they were carried out too fast – a warning @entity25 immediately seized on			1
the chancellor joined @entity28 ministers from the @entity5 countries at a summit in @entity31 , @entity32 , where they were struggling to agree on how to tackle the eurozone debt crisis and faltering global economy			2
hours after president @entity35 announced a £ 280billion spending package to boost jobs in the @entity38 mr @entity7 dismissed suggestions that @entity14 should follow a similar course to kick - start growth			1
the chancellor – who himself admitted this week growth forecasts are likely to be downgraded – said that ditching the @entity45 ’s package of cuts and tax rises would undermine international confidence in @entity14 and could push up interest rates			1
he said : ‘ we will stick to the deficit reduction plan we have set out			0
it is the rock of stability on which our economy is built			2
‘ it has delivered record low interest rates			1
abandoning it would put that at risk			0
nothing would be more damaging for @entity14 at this fragile moment for the world ’s economy than an increase in mortgage rates and an increase in the cost of borrowing			1
’ this graph shows a similar pattern to the 18 months before the 2008 recession growth in @entity71 countries looks like it 's set to slow down as well speaking in @entity72 , mrs @entity2 said the risks from stagnating growth were growing , and had to be weighed against the huge deficits carried by many @entity77 economies			1
she said although tackling deficits was crucial , ‘ consolidation , if it happens too quickly , will hurt the economy and worsen job prospects ’			2
she warned that ministers needed to be ‘ nimble ’ in responding to a fresh downturn			0
@entity7 today met @entity1 head @entity2 where the pair agreed the @entity14 's approach to deficit reduction was appropriate she added : ‘ the policy stance [ in the @entity14 ] was premised on a greater role for private sector demand , especially a robust recovery in exports , to take over as the public sector retrenched			1
but since the summer the outlook has been more subdued , including in particular @entity96 ... and the @entity38 , which are the two main trading partners of the @entity14			1
‘ the policy stance remains appropriate			0
but the heightened risk means a heightened readiness to respond , particularly if it looks like the economy is headed for weak growth			1
’ she also suggested there was ‘ room ’ for the @entity105 to carry out another round of printing money , adding that the ‘ risk of recession ’ currently outweighed the ‘ risk of inflation ’			2
shadow chancellor @entity112 said : ‘ @entity2 is right to repeat her warning that cutting too quickly will hurt the recovery and jobs			0
this is clearly a message aimed at @entity38 , the eurozone and @entity14 too			2
’ the @entity118 looks set to take a hit while the @entity38 and @entity120 will grow @entity35 began a tour of the @entity38 yesterday to drum up support for his £ 280billion package to boost the country ’s jobs market			0
the plans seek to create jobs through spending heavily on upgrading roads , bridges and school buildings			0
the president urged @entity132 to pass the bill ‘ quickly ’			0
but right - wingers say the plans simply add to @entity38 ’s mountain of debt			0
spend , spend , spend : @entity38 president @entity35 last night announced a £ 250billion jobs plan savers have been warned that the rock - bottom rates that have frozen their nest eggs will not rise ‘ until 2013 ’			2
the @entity105 cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent in march 2009 , the lowest level in history			1
and for the 30th consecutive month , it voted yesterday to keep this base rate , the longest period of unchanged rates since the @entity149			2
economists have warned savers , who are being hit by account interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent , that it is likely to last for at least another year			1
but @entity154 , chief @entity14 economist at the consultancy @entity155 , said : ‘ we suspect that interest rates are unlikely to rise before 2013			1
’ homeowners with a variable mortage can look forward to a further extended period of low rates			0
but for savers , the income from their savings , which many pensioners rely on , has all but disappeared			0
@entity165 , from the campaign group @entity166 , added : ‘ current policies are squeezing savers to the brink of extinction			0
’ a recent poll by the price comparison site @entity173 of more than 7,200 adults said more than half would like to see a rate rise ‘ in the near future ’ .			0

growth will be just *0.3* per cent in the last three months of the year , the @entity179 says
@entity105 keeps interest rates at 0.5 per cent in a bid to kick start the @entity14 economy
