new move : @entity1 has backed up his promotion of marriage by introducing a tax break for couples @entity1 has shown his support for same - sex couples by taking to @entity8 to announce gay partners will benefit from new marriage tax breaks			1
the prime minister has announced plans for married couples to receive a £ 1,000 tax allowance in recognition of their ‘ commitment and responsibility ’			1
the tax break will be available to gay couples in civil partnerships and – following a change in the law – in marriages			1
taking to @entity8 , mr @entity1 wrote : ' the £ 1000 marriage tax allowance will apply to straight and gay couples , as well as civil partners			1
love is love , commitment is commitment			2
' in an article for the @entity32 , the prime minister says the transferable allowance will be introduced in 2015			1
stay - at - home mothers and women who work part time will be the main winners			2
‘ the values of marriage are give and take , support and sacrifice – values that we need more of , ’ mr @entity1 writes			2
‘ marriage is a good thing for our country – it ’s the ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our support for it			1
’ the move , first promised by the prime minister when he ran for the @entity52 leadership in 2005 , restores the financial recognition for marriage lost when a similar allowance was phased out in 1999			1
under mr @entity1 ’s plans , which he will champion at his party conference next week , a husband or wife will be allowed to transfer £ 1,000 of their tax - free personal allowance to their spouse			1
support : prime minister @entity1 tweeted his backing for same - sex couples to be included in new marriage tax breaks the @entity52 2010 election manifesto promised a figure of only £ 750			1
it will apply to those not using all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children , or work part time and earn less than £ 10,000			1
around eight million people are expected to benefit – by around £ 200 a year			2
the @entity80 , who object to any special recognition for marriage , will abstain in a vote on the issue , a provision included in the 2010 coalition agreement			2
but even if , as expected , @entity88 opposes the measure it should pass thanks to the votes of conservative mps			0
it will be confirmed in chancellor @entity95 ’s autumn statement and introduced from april 2015 – making it a key issue at the general election a few weeks later			0
happy memories : @entity1 , pictured on his wedding day with @entity101 , has stuck to his principles and rewarded married couples the tax break will not be available to couples that have a higher rate taxpayer which , in 2015 , will be those earning more than £ 42,285			1
mr @entity1 ’s decision to press ahead will delight most conservative mps and polls suggest the move is supported by around two thirds of voters			0
the @entity115 argue that , for 11 years , @entity88 undermined marriage and financially punished couples where one spouse chooses to stay at home to bring up a family			1
the @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 are among nations that reward the caring role of stay - at - home spouses			2
however , the tax measure , expected to cost around £ 600million a year , will provoke controversy at a time of austerity			1
it had been put on hold because of the efforts to rein in state spending , and the priority given to the @entity141 ’s goal of increasing the personal tax allowance for 24million basic rate taxpayers to £ 10,000 a year			1
but right - wing @entity115 , including several members of the @entity145 , indicated they wanted action quickly			1
the measure may help placate social conservatives uneasy at the government ’s focus on introducing gay marriage , as well as the removal of child benefit from high earners			1
mr @entity95 has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women – leading right - wing @entity115 to insist it is right for the government to show support for stay - at - home mothers as well			1
@entity161 , a @entity52 former minister who campaigned for the tax break , said : ‘ the government is sending out a very strong signal that marriage and the commitment it demonstrates is good for families , children and society , both socially and financially , and we should not be afraid to stand up for it			1
’ deputy prime minister @entity172 has branded the idea ‘ odd ’ , while @entity80 business secretary @entity174 has complained widows and those abandoned by their partners will be excluded			1
happy ? married couples will be praying the new tax break gets passed through government ( posed by models ) work and pensions secretary @entity182 , who has driven the party ’s policy on backing for marriage , initially proposed a larger tax break costing £ 3.2billion a year			1
but he agreed there should be a staggered introduction of tax allowances because of the catastrophic state of the public finances			2
in 1999 , its final year before it was abolished for all but pensioner couples , the married couples allowance was worth £ 197 a year			1
marriage is already recognised in both inheritance tax and capital gains tax			1
for more than 20 years , the @entity32 has led calls for marriage to be recognised in the tax system once more			1
alongside the birth of my children , my wedding was the happiest day of my life			0
since then , @entity101 and i have been a team			0
nothing i ’ve done since – becoming a member of parliament , leader of my party or prime minister – would have been possible without her			1
there is something special about marriage : it ’s a declaration of commitment , responsibility and stability that helps to bind families			1
the values of marriage are give and take , support and sacrifice – values that we need more of in this country			2
of course , governments ca n’t be in the business of social engineering – there is nothing more scary than the prospect of a politician trying to do so			0
and naturally , there are people across the country who have never married and are just as committed to each other			0
team : @entity1 credits much of his success at @entity237 to his wife @entity101 we also know that sadly too many marriages come to an end			0
but surely we can agree with all these things , yet at the same time support something which we know can help keep families together			0
there is good evidence about the positive role that marriage can play : study upon study has shown that families with married couples are less likely to break up			1
there are also many studies about the cost of family breakdown			0
i am not for one minute arguing that marriage is a panacea , of course it is n’t			2
but the real question is this : because marriage is an institution that helps to build a strong society , should n’t society properly recognise that in the tax system ? other countries do – i think we should too			1
that ’s why when i ran for the leadership of my party back in 2005 , i said that i wanted to do more for marriage in the tax system : a personal pledge that i made right at the start of my campaign – and i then backed that up with a pledge in our manifesto at the last election			2
so next week at the @entity52 ’s conference in @entity283 , i ’m going to deliver on the promise i made			0
from april 2015 , if neither of you are higher rate taxpayers , you will be able to transfer £ 1,000 of your tax - free allowance to your spouse			1
in effect , if you pay the basic rate of tax and your partner does n’t use all of their personal allowance , you ’ll be able to have some of it			2
most couples who benefit will be £ 200 a year better off as a result			2
and of course this will be true if you ’re gay or straight – and in a civil partnership or a marriage			2
this summer i was proud to make equal marriage the law			0
love is love , commitment is commitment			0
proud : @entity1 believes there is something ' very special ' about marriage , and that needs rewarding i ’m really proud that we ’re getting this done			0
but when you make an important change like this , i know that people will have questions			0
what ’s more , whenever you talk about the family as a politician , it ’s all too easy for your opponents to twist your meaning			0
@entity88 wo n’t miss a trick : they will spend the next week peddling false and inaccurate myths rather than having a sensible debate			0
so let ’s address a few of the myths that are likely are to spring up			0
this is not about stigmatising unmarried people or single parents : as i ’ve already said , you do n’t have to be married to have a family life that is rock solid – and we support all families through the tax and benefits system			0
all we ’re saying is that marriage is a good thing for our country – it ’s the ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our support for it			2
next , the charge will come up that we ’re trying to bribe people to get married			0
frankly this is a pretty depressing – and wrong - headed – view of human nature			0
people are n’t going to choose to get married for a few extra pounds each week			0
this policy is n’t about the money but about the message that people who make a lasting commitment should be recognised in some way			0
finally , @entity88 will say we ’re favouring some families over others			0
but i ’m happy to defend our record any day of the week			0
from tax - free childcare for every working family to an income tax cut for 25million people – from cutting fuel duty to freezing council tax – we ’re doing something for all families even in these difficult times			2
compare this to the promises that @entity88 made to you last week – promises that fell apart within a matter of hours			0
from tomorrow the @entity52 will be gathering in @entity283			0
together we ’ll be speaking to the nation with a clear message – we are backing hard - working people in this country every step of the way			0
whether you ’re young and hungry for your first job or a family tired of renting and looking to own your first home , then the @entity52 will help you achieve your dreams			0
supporting marriage is part of that vision for @entity390 , recognising an institution that is all about commitment			1
i ’m proud that we ’re finally making this happen – and proud that we ’re delivering on the promise i made .			0
