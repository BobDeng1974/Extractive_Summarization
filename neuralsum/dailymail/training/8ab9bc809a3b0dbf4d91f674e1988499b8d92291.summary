from the moment @entity1 was named as the venue for the @entity3 of this year ’s @entity4 , the script has had @entity5 raising his arms in victory in @entity8 on saturday			1
a win would see him pull on the @entity11 ’s yellow jersey for the first time in his career — and in his mother , @entity15 ’s , home town , too			1
‘ it ’s incredible that for the second time in my career the @entity18 ’s got the @entity3 of the @entity4 , ’ said @entity5 on thursday			1

@entity4 does n’t begin and end in @entity1			2
