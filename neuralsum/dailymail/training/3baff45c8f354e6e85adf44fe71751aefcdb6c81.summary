' it was a rough weekend for us on the court and it just wo n't end			0
' when the players realized how low they were on food , local officials dropped off snacks and drinks			1
before the supplies arrived , the team had resorted to turning some of the snow into water			1
' we have snacks , some granola bars and pretzels , ' @entity58 said			2
' we found six bottles of water and have been rationing it			2
' we thought we 'd be here for a couple hours and a couple of hours turned into 12 hours			0

' still smiling : there were 25 students and coaches from @entity10 's squad on board - as well as head coach @entity20 's one - year - old son ( they are pictured together center ) in it together : spirits remained high , their coach said , and they eventually started moving this morning hanging in there : ' we have been praying each hour , ' this photo 's caption read			1
' it has now been 24 hours ' kindness of strangers : one of the team members shared this photo to @entity89 with the caption : ' thank you @entity92 ! ! ! random citizens came to bring us snacks ! very grateful ' stash : the student took a snap of the snacks given to them by strangers and local officials still , she said that the team - and her young son - had remained in good spirits and were enjoying sharing selfies and photos of the snow on social media			1
' they really have been great , ' she said			0
' there 's been no complaining at all			0
they 've been joking around : i want a steak , i want a soft taco , a slurpee			0
' as well as posing for pictures , players had also watched movies and the @entity123 - @entity122 men 's basketball game on television tuesday night , she said			2
other motorists also came on the bus seeking shelter and chatted with the team			0
' there 's definitely nothing in the coaching handbook to prepare you for this , ' she added			0
' i 'm sure when it 's all done we 'll look back at it and remember how great a bonding experience it was			2
for now , i think everyone just wants to get home and sleep in their own beds			0
