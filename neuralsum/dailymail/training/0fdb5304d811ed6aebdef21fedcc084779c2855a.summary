a former @entity1 nurse who searched for suicidal people online and encouraged them to kill themselves has been sentenced to 178 days in prison			1
@entity4 was convicted in september of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an @entity11 man and a @entity13 woman			1
the 52 - year - old was sentenced to three years in prison , but he will not have to serve the prison term if he complies with conditions of probation that include the jail time			1
@entity4 ( pictured in 2011 with his wife @entity20 ) was convicted in september of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an @entity11 man and a @entity13 woman prosecutors said @entity4 , was obsessed with suicide and got a thrill from preying on people in their most desperate hours			1
they said he posed as a suicidal female nurse to win his victims ' trust , then entered false suicide pacts and offered detailed instructions on how people could take their own lives			1
the convictions came after the @entity39 narrowed the state 's assisted - suicide law and reversed earlier convictions			1
@entity43 , pictured , 18 , of @entity44 , @entity45 , who jumped into a frozen river in 2008 in september , @entity48 district judge @entity47 ruled that @entity4 , pictured , had assisted in the suicide of @entity50 , 32 , of @entity51 , @entity11 prosecutors say @entity4 , of @entity53 , @entity39 was obsessed with suicide and hanging and sought out potential victims on the internet			1
when he found them , prosecutors say , he posed in chat rooms and in e-mails as a woman , using such names as ‘ @entity63 ’ or ‘ @entity64 ’ , playing the role of a compassionate friend , and offering step - by - step instructions on how they could take their lives			2
according to court documents , mr @entity50 posted a message in a chat room , asking if anyone had instructions on how to hang oneself without access to something high			0
he began receiving e-mails from ‘ @entity77 ’ containing detailed instructions			0
the prosecutor in 2011 said that mr @entity50 died by the hanging methods described by ‘ @entity63			0
’ he said that in mr @entity82 's last communication with @entity4 he said he was scared and ' holding on to the hope that things might change '			2
in the @entity13 case , evidence shows miss @entity43 went online saying she wanted to commit suicide but was afraid of failing			1
five days later , she participated in online chats with ‘ @entity64 ’ - who prosecutors say was actually @entity4 , claiming to be a 31 - year - old emergency room nurse			1
during the chats , miss @entity43 said she planned to jump into a river the following sunday , and @entity94 said if that did n’t work , they would hang themselves together that monday			2
‘ we are together in this , ’ miss @entity43 wrote			0
‘ yes i promise , monday will be my day , ’ @entity94 replied			2
in september , @entity48 district judge @entity47 ruled that @entity4 had assisted in the suicide of @entity50 , 32 , of @entity51 , @entity11			1
but he found the state had failed to prove he had done the same in the death of @entity43 , 18 , of @entity44 , @entity45 , instead convicting @entity4 of a lesser charge of attempting to help her take her life			1
' i am sorry ... for my actions and what i have done , ' @entity4 said in court before he was sentenced			2
' it was the second time @entity4 was tried in the deaths			1
in 2011 he was convicted under a law that made it illegal to ' advise ' or ' encourage ' suicides			2
@entity4 told police in interviews that he did it for the ' thrill of the chase			2
' prosecutors said he acknowledged participating in online chats about suicide with up to 20 people and entering into fake suicide pacts with about 10 people , five of whom he believed killed themselves			0
the judge in @entity127 at the time said he showed a minimal level of remorse despite admitting his deeds were ' dark ' and ' disgusting '			0
but in march 2014 , the @entity39 ruled the law amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on speech , reports the @entity135			1
@entity4 remained free on appeal			0
the state tried him again , this time under a separate part of the law making it crime to ' assist ' in a suicide if the speech is targeted at one person and provides someone with advice needed to kill him or herself			2
' when @entity43 died , the best parts of me died with her , ' her mother , @entity149 , said during an emotional statement in court in 2011			0
' what @entity4 did was vile , offensive and most importantly , illegal			0
' he knowingly chose to mastermind the deaths of some and destroy the lives of many			0
' @entity48 attorney @entity157 , ( left ) and defense attorney @entity158 ( right ) speak with the media outside the @entity160 @entity43 's family talked of a bright woman who wanted to become a lawyer and mother , and had only become depressed after she went away to college			0
six months after starting , she disappeared			0
some family members at first thought she had been kidnapped , and told the court of the horror of searching for her for six weeks until her body was found			0
after @entity50 's death , police scanned his computer and discovered he sought advice online			0
they later realised the person giving advice on how he should hang himself was @entity4 , according to prosecutor			0
@entity4 must report to jail october 24			1
