police stop and search an @entity17 motorist in @entity18 : the recent ruling to reform the @entity3 's controversial ' stop - and - frisk ' tactic has already led to a sharp rise in shootings , figures reveal the shocking rise in gun crime has emerged days after the federal judge who ordered an overhaul of the stop - and - frisk strategy refused to delay it pending an appeal by the city			1
@entity33 district judge @entity32 said such a delay would send ' precisely the wrong signal			1
' she had ordered changes in august after finding the program discriminates against minorities			2
police have stopped , questioned and sometimes patted down about 5million people over a decade			0
dismissing the suggestion that reforms of the ' stop - and - frisk ' strategy be delayed , judge @entity32 wrote : ' ordering a stay now would send precisely the wrong signal			1
' it would essentially confirm that the past practices , resulting in hundreds of thousands of stops - overwhelmingly of minorities - that resulted in little or no enforcement action or seizure of contraband were justified and based on constitutional police practices			0
' it would also send the message that reducing the number of stops is somehow dangerous to the residents of this city			2
' but with figures showing the number of gunshot victims up 9 per cent over the same period last year following the ruling on august 12 , that 's the message implicit in the latest statistics on gun crime on @entity67			1
seizures of firearms are also down , with 239 taken by police between august 10 and september 8 , compared with 289 over the same period last year , according to the statistics seen by the @entity72			1
and gun charges have fallen by more than 15 per cent from 492 last year to 417 this year			1
sources blamed @entity32 's ruling for the disturbing trends			2
a police department source told the @entity72 that police are reluctant to stop and search because ' they 're scared of being sued			0
' ' they feel as if the city is not going to indemnify them in lawsuits , ' the source said			0
' they never stop and frisk old white guys like me ' : @entity33 district judge @entity32 ruled the tactic unconstitutional last month after finding the program discriminates against minorities judge @entity32 has not commented on today 's statistics , but on tuesday she criticised ' certain high - level city officials and pundits ' who have misinterpreted her ruling			1
she said she did not order an end to the stop - and - frisk program but instead insisted that it be carried out legally			0
and she defended her remedies , which include the appointment of a monitor to ensure the program 's legality and of a facilitator to conduct meetings with interested parties in neighborhoods where frequent stops occur			0
she had also ordered some officers to wear cameras			0
she said the vast majority of the overhaul wo n't be implemented until the monitor and the facilitator meet with the community , the police department and other stakeholders to create sensible solutions			0
' in short , the only activity at this stage is discussion between the monitor , the facilitator and the parties to develop the remedies , ' she said			0
' no other specific relief is imminent , much less ordered			0
' @entity125 , the city 's top lawyer , said in a statement that the city remains committed to reversing @entity32 's rulings as quickly as possible			2
he noted that the city has asked the 2nd @entity33 @entity131 in @entity132 for an expedited appeal so police officers are not in limbo			0
' we can not afford such delay , as public safety is of paramount concern to the mayor and the police commissioner , ' he said .			2
