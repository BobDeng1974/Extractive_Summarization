the @entity1 has spent more than £ 30million on taxis for patients in the past three years because of a shortage of specially equipped transport , it has been revealed			1
patient transport services - provided free to those who are too ill or unable to travel to and from hospitals such as those with broken limbs - are mainly run by ambulance trusts			1
they are normally equipped with medical supplies such as oxygen and driven by trained crews			1
but a @entity17 request has revealed the extent of taxi use - at great cost to the taxpayer and potential risk to the patient			1
private hire : ambulance trusts are regularly paying to transport ill patients by taxi the figures from ambulance trusts in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were revealed by the @entity33			2
health chiefs insisted the practice was not putting patients at risk , but admitted they were trying to cut the use of taxis amid worries they were not providing value for money			2
the @entity44 spent the most on taxis - £ 9.9million since april 2008 , on more than 500,000 journeys			1
some trusts also provided information on the most costly taxi journeys they had paid for			2
these included two fares in excess of £ 700 , one for a 184 - mile journey from @entity53 to @entity54 when a patient was discharged from @entity56 , while the second was for a 151 - mile trip from @entity59 in north @entity60 to @entity61 , @entity62			1
patient transport services - provided free to those who are too ill or unable to travel to and from hospitals - are mainly run by ambulance trusts , although private firms are used in some places			1
the findings revealed a number of very expensive taxi journeys : £ 700 + for a 184 - mile journey from @entity53 to @entity54 £ 700 + for a 151 - mile trip from @entity59 , in north @entity60 , to @entity61 , @entity62 £ 670.86 for a 290 - mile journey from @entity75 in @entity76 to a nursing home in @entity78 , @entity79 , £ 600 for a 262 - mile journey from @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity60 , to @entity83 other costly taxi journeys included a £ 670.86 fare for a 290 - mile journey from @entity75 in @entity76 to a nursing home in @entity78 , @entity79 , by @entity89 ambulance bosses			1
another £ 600 was paid for a 262 - mile journey from @entity81 in @entity82 to @entity83 by @entity60 's ambulance service			1
the services rely on specially adapted vehicles - normally minibuses equipped with basic medical supplies such as oxygen - staffed by trained crews to ferry patients around			1
for those who do not need any medical assistance , official ambulance trust cars can be used to drive them			2
however , if neither of these options are available patients have to be ferried in private taxis			2
only the @entity107 has avoided paying anything out to taxis in the past three years , while @entity60 has reduced its reliance on them to fewer than 100 journeys a year			0
the figures show that all other ambulance trusts use taxis on a regular basis			0
@entity116 , from @entity117 , said : ' there may be occasions where it is unavoidable , but while these are not patients who have dialled 999 , there will be times when they will need someone with more skills and training than just how to drive			0
' but our concerns about patient transport services go wider than use of taxis			0
there are big differences in the way that patient transport is provided and what standards are kept to in different areas			0
' increasingly , services are being outsourced to private firms which means that competition is based on costs , and standards are being driven down			0
this also means it 's harder to find out what is happening			0
but @entity147 , the director of patient transport services at @entity149 and vice-chairman of the @entity151 , said while there was concern about taxi use , it was on value - for - money grounds rather than safety			1
he said : ' anyone needing medical help in any way would not go by taxis			0
' i think there will always be a need for them at times , but each service needs to look at how they are using them and whether there is a more efficient and better way of transporting patients			0
' that is what we are gearing up to in the @entity176			0
' the @entity177 said decisions about how to transport patients were the responsibility of local @entity1 chiefs			0
data for @entity183 was not available .			0

one 184 - mile journey from @entity53 to @entity54 cost £ *777.45*
