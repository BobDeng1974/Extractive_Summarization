taking statins could help prevent breast cancer , new research suggests			2
the cholesterol - reducing drugs are already taken by seven million people in the @entity5 , with the aim of reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes			2
but @entity5 scientists say the cheap drugs , which cost the @entity12 less than £ 2 a month to prescribe for each person , could also drastically reduce the risk of breast cancer			2
a study of more than 600,000 women found that breast cancer risk was almost doubled in those with high levels of fat in their blood			1
a study of more than one million women in the @entity5 over a 14 - year period has suggested there is a link between high cholesterol levels and developing breast cancer the research is still at an early stage and the findings do not yet prove that cholesterol helps trigger breast cancer			1
but if future work demonstrates a causal link it raises the possibility of using statins to reduce women ’s risk of the disease			0
cardiologist @entity43 , from the @entity44 in @entity45 , said : ‘ we found that women with high cholesterol had a significantly greater chance of developing breast cancer			1
‘ this was an observational study so we ca n’t conclude that high cholesterol causes breast cancer , but the strength of this association warrants further investigation			1
‘ a prospective study that monitors the risk of breast cancer in women with and without high cholesterol is needed to confirm what we observed			1
if the connection between high cholesterol and breast cancer is validated , the next step would be to see if lowering cholesterol with statins can reduce the risk of developing cancer			1
’ a total of 664,159 women from across the @entity5 whose health records were stored on a national database took part in the study			0
statistical analysis showed that those with high cholesterol were 1.64 times more likely to have breast cancer than women with normal levels			1
around 50,000 @entity5 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five of them in the post-menopausal years			2
previous research has shown a clear association between obesity and breast cancer in post-menopausal women			0
and a @entity91 study last year found that a product of cholesterol , called @entity94 , fuels human breast tumours in genetically engineered laboratory mice			0
researchers found women with high cholesterol , or hyperlipidaemia , increased their risk of breast cancer by 1.64 times scientists also discovered higher levels of @entity94 in both healthy breast tissue and tumour cells in women with breast cancer			1
dr @entity43 , who presented his findings at a @entity111 meeting in @entity112 , @entity113 , said : ‘ we have a general principle that obesity is linked to breast cancer and a study in mice suggested that this may be because of cholesterol			0
statins are already @entity5 ’s most prescribed drug but new @entity12 guidelines to be published later this month will dramatically increase the number of people eligible for a prescription			0
at the moment statins are available to those deemed to have a 20 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade			0
the new guidelines will lower the threshold to anyone at a 10 per cent risk , which could increase the number of people on statins by up to 10million additional patients			0
the planned shift to ‘ pre-emptive ’ prescribing has led some gps to warn of a needless ‘ medicalisation ’ of people who do not need drugs			0
but others say the chance to cheaply and effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and other diseases can not be ignored			0
‘ we decided to investigate whether there was any association between hyperlipidaemia , which is high cholesterol essentially , and breast cancer			2
’ he added : ‘ while our study was preliminary , our results are promising			0
’ ‘ statins are cheap , widely available and relatively safe			0
we are potentially heading towards a clinical trial in 10 to 15 years to test the effect of statins on the incidence of breast cancer			1
if such a trial is successful , statins may have a role in the prevention of breast cancer , especially in high risk groups , such as women with high cholesterol			1
’ baroness @entity170 , chief executive of the @entity172 charity , said : ‘ these are interesting results that report a link between increased fat in the blood and an increased risk of breast cancer			1
‘ however , this is just the first step in understanding more about how cholesterol relates to the risk of breast cancer , and more research is needed to determine whether statins could help prevent breast cancer			0
‘ we do know that being overweight , particularly after menopause , can increase a woman ’s risk of developing breast cancer			2
we would encourage women to maintain a healthy weight and to discuss any concerns , such as their breast cancer risk , weight or cholesterol levels with their gp			1

a study of more than 600,000 women in the @entity5 found a link between having high cholesterol levels and developing breast cancer
*doctors* believe a full clinical trial to test the effect of cholesterol - *busting* statins on the number of cases could happen within 10 years
researchers found having a high cholesterol increased the risk of developing breast cancer by 1.64 times
