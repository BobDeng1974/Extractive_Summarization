by @entity0 and @entity1 the decorated @entity2 known as @entity3 has claimed he was forced out of the military because of his push for @entity8 troops to ' go native '			1
for years special forces major @entity9 had been praised for battle skills , but in 2012 he was forced to take retirement over claims that he was drinking and giving fuel to tribal police			1
he was also reprimanded for allowing his girlfriend - war correspondent and former @entity18 reporter @entity16 - to live with him in a dangerous region of the war - torn country			1
the 44 - year - old formed such a close bond with the @entity28 villagers he and his men were living alongside that he was made a tribal leader by the @entity47 tribe			1
with his long hair , unkempt bear and flowing robes , @entity9 looked more like @entity51 than a @entity8 military officer - but his command was successful and his fame as @entity55 of @entity30 meant he was welcoming @entity56 to his @entity29 base			1
senator @entity58 and presidential candidate @entity59 were just some of the politicians who wanted to see first hand the unconventional success @entity9 , who was awarded the @entity65 medal for service in @entity67 , enjoyed			1
despite the high - profile visits , none noticed that he had @entity70 living with him , in direct violation of military rules			2
secret love affair : @entity16 and @entity9 became part of the @entity28 tribe he was supporting and their relationship blossomed in @entity78 , in northern @entity30 revelations : @entity16 and former major @entity9 discussed their secret love affair and life in @entity30 for @entity39 @entity9 won over his superiors in 2009 , at a time when the @entity8 feared it was losing the war in @entity30 in 2009			1
he wrote a 45 - page pamphlet , @entity87 , which detailed how the @entity8 could win			1
he believed the only way to do this was to earn the loyalty of the country 's @entity28 tribes - and he thought the way to do this was to go native			2
the pamphlet so impressed @entity95 , who had been made commander in @entity30 in 2010 , that he encourage @entity32 to follow through with his theories			1
' it was n't about our weapons or our body armor ... it was gon na be about how we treated them			0
it worked in a big way , ' said @entity9			2
he pushed for troops to drop their heavy armor and military fatigues for tribal dress , saying that as well as instill trust in locals , it also was more comfortable for his men			2
' you could move further , you could move faster , you could run farther			0
you could take cover more quickly			0
you could carry more ammunition , you could carry more water			0
it was just an absolute no brainer , ' he said			0
after winning over the locals he was able to convince them to fight the @entity122			0
he told them : ' tell everyone you come into contact with , i did not come here to fight			0
i came here to help the people , ” @entity9 told dozens of tribal police in one 2012 video @entity70 shot			1
' but if someone wants to f * * * in ’ fight , they know where i am			0
' backing : general @entity95 is seen here with major @entity9 in @entity29 on a visit in 2011			1
the former general endorsed @entity9 's unconventional methods fighting force : @entity32 with members of his @entity28 tribesmen who joined him in fighting the @entity122 before he was airlifted out in march 2012 general @entity95 visited @entity9 in 2011 and saw the level to which he had become accepted by the tribesmen , even becoming like a son to their chief , @entity148 , nicknamed @entity150			1
document : @entity70 has written @entity8 @entity152 which recounts her time in @entity30 with @entity9 ' @entity9 did go native			1
you go native so that the natives feel that you respect them and are comfortable with them and trust them , above all			0
and he really was adopted as a son by @entity150 ... there was no question about the relationship between these two individuals			0
and that 's what you want , ' @entity95 said to @entity39			1
' @entity9 had become more @entity28 than the @entity28 , ' @entity70 wrote in her book			2
but some thought @entity9 was going too native and whispered that he was becoming a @entity168 figure along the lines of @entity171 's character in the @entity173 film , @entity172			1
@entity9 's theory of how to win the trust of @entity30 was tested to its limit amid widespread anger after @entity8 troops accidentally burned copies of the @entity180 in a separate province			1
in violation of a country - wide order from his superiors to keep his post on lock down , @entity9 told his men they were to continue walking through the village			1
in footage filmed by @entity70 as he briefed the men , @entity9 is heard saying : ' you 're going to have to trust me			2
i 'm putting your lives in my f * * * * * * hand and saying i 'm going to protect you			0
' he said despite orders to stay at their post , he intended to walk around the village to show that he trusted them			0
clandestine : @entity70 and @entity9 knew that if their affair was confirmed to his superiors then his career could be over special force : major @entity9 suffers from @entity209 now following his service in @entity67 and @entity30 and struggles with the manner in which he was dismissed from the military friends : @entity32 became so accepted by his @entity28 tribesmen that the chief @entity148 , nicknamed @entity150 , thought of him as his son @entity70 said : ' you must trust the people you 're with , and therein lies your security			1
' @entity9 also admitted to @entity39 that it was sometimes safer to break the rules that to follow them while in @entity30			1
since being removed from the country in 2012 , forced to shave , and then stripped of his military honors , @entity9 has been living in @entity226 , @entity227			1
he returned with @entity70 to the @entity30 village they had lived in for so long two years ago , and was greeted like family			1
footage shows villagers embracing @entity9 and firing their weapons into the surrounding hills in celebration			2
@entity9 described it as ' happy gunfire ' and said : ' music to my ears , yes ... and it was saying , " i love you and i miss you "			2
' it was a more welcome response than his final dealings with the military , who had condemned him for being a ' disgrace ' - a charge he says causes him the most pain after all the success he enjoyed			0
@entity9 's commanders claim to this day that they had no idea that the @entity2 was keeping a woman the @entity122 openly referred to in radio communications as ' his wife ' by his side - against all rules and regulations			1
trust : looking more like @entity51 - @entity32 ( center ) was named commander @entity9 by his @entity28 troops dismissed : when the military found out about @entity9 's history of drinking and his affair with @entity70 they airlifted him out of @entity266 despite their love affair , @entity9 had endured constant fighting in @entity29 for 22 consecutive months and had developed a problem with drinking and pain killers			1
drinking in @entity30 is against army rules as is conducting ongoing relationships during warfare			2
in confidential files revealed by @entity70 and @entity9 , the major was relieved because he ' indulged in a self - created fantasy world ' supported by his ' wife '			1
he was stripped of his @entity281 honors , demoted to captain and made to retire			2
we both knew that there was a lot of risk in doing what we did			0
and i would do it again , ' @entity9 told @entity39 this month in his first television interview			2
' it was extremely unconventional , yes , to say the least			0
' emotional : two years on @entity9 struggles to talk about how he left @entity30 @entity292 life : major @entity9 suffers ptsd now and is trying to re-adjust to life in @entity226 in that interview , @entity9 admits he drank , took drugs and kept @entity70 with him - all against regulations			1
however , he claims that his superiors were aware he was not a by - the - book soldier and luminaries such as retired @entity95 were supporters			1
' i never left the battlefield defeated			0
i never lost a man			0
well over 20 awards for valor for the men that i fought alongside			0
we went after ‘ em every single day			0
i brought all my men home			0
that ’s it , ' @entity9 said			2
indeed , @entity95 still calls @entity9 , @entity3 - a comparison that @entity9 was keen to play up to			1
despite all that has happened , @entity9 and @entity70 , who married last year , have come forward to tell their story in @entity70 's new book , @entity8 @entity152 : @entity316 , @entity317 of @entity281 major @entity9			1
in march , @entity319 filed a statement accusing @entity9 of ' immoral and illegal activities and actions ' and said he was often ' intoxicated and under the influence of pain medications			0
' @entity9 admits this , claiming he was suffering @entity209 brought on by his constant services			0
' i was drinking alcohol , i was taking sleeping medication			0
i was taking pain medication , ' @entity9 explained in the @entity39 interview			0
' i admitted to that			0
they came in and got me out of there			0
' he was airlifted out immediately and made to shave his beard and wear his uniform			0
' i would have rather been in the hands of the @entity122 at that point , ' he said			0
' he was flown to @entity344 , @entity345 where his @entity2 status was stripped and he was demoted to captain			0
his superior officer lt. general @entity348 delivered what @entity9 saw as the killer blow			2
his reprimand labeled @entity9 a ' disgrace ' with no ' moral character ' , having ' indulged in a self - created fantasy world			2

major @entity356 was respected and praised by then general @entity95 - @entity8 commander in @entity30
the former general encouraged @entity9 's unconventional tactics to dress and act like locals
@entity9 was airlifted out of the village in 2012 , demoted and asked to retire
