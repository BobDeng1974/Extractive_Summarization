the only people who could possibly have caught @entity1 on sunday were @entity2			1
he disappeared off our screens almost all afternoon only to emerge as the inevitable winner of the @entity8 @entity7			1
it was the perfect end to a fantastic fortnight for @entity1 who got married , watched @entity8 win the @entity11 and signed a new £ 40million contract with @entity13			1
as @entity1 lapped up @entity15 , the @entity8 national anthem , plus the applause of his home crowd at @entity19 , @entity14 looked slightly glum			1
he was perhaps a bit hard on himself , for he drove swashbucklingly well from 20th on the grid to finish third			1
celebrate : @entity1 sprays champagne after winning the @entity8 @entity7 on sunday happy : @entity1 accepts the admiration of the @entity8 fans as @entity14 rubs his eyes ( right ) catch me if you can : @entity1 led the way after starting in pole position in @entity19 well done : @entity1 embraces @entity30 ( right ) after winning the @entity8 @entity7 in @entity19 @entity31 uses local knowledge to triumph he slipped a further 10 points behind @entity35 in the drivers ’ standings , a mercifully small margin given that brake failure in qualifying left his legs , back and car badly bruised			1
the gap is now at 14			1
asked if his glass was half full or half empty at the end of an entertaining race , he sighed : ‘ hmm			2
i do n’t know how to answer that			2
i came from the back to get on the podium — it ’s quite an achievement so half full			1
‘ but i ca n’t be too ecstatic about it because it has been a tough weekend for me and i ’ve ultimately lost more points to @entity1 in the championship battle			1
’ the title will probably be decided by the final race of the season in @entity58 , where points ludicrously count double			2
the loser of that contest , joked @entity13 boss @entity62 , might need psychological help			1
@entity14 was all action here , going three abreast with @entity66 ’s @entity65 and @entity68 ’s @entity67			1
it was reminiscent of a move that imprinted itself on the conscience of the wider world in the @entity74 race at @entity75 eight years ago he was again brave and daring , his car emerging from the outside of the hairpin ahead			0
for the most part , his car was so much stronger than the rest that he simply scythed through the field			0
he briefly lay second while others pitted but was ultimately thwarted in his attempt to pip @entity85 ’ @entity84 to runners - up spot			2
@entity14 was not helped in this endeavour by clipping @entity89 ’s @entity88 , believing his old team - mate was letting him through			1
his front wing was damaged and he lost downforce , but he continued , waving in apology as he passed @entity89 the following lap. @entity96 finishers : @entity1 won the race whilst @entity14 came from the back to finish third losing ground : @entity14 is now 10 points behind his @entity13 team - mate in the standings ‘ he has been such a gentleman this year and not given me too much trouble getting past but it was just a misunderstanding today , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ i was n’t close enough to try and pass but i was on the inside line in the corner			0
it looked like he had gone wide , then he cut back across the corner and perhaps he did n’t see me there			2
' i lost quite a bit of downforce with the damage and it made it very hard to look after the front left tyre			0
we converted from a two - stop strategy to three			2
’ however , @entity89 was unimpressed by @entity14 ’s driving			1
‘ why would we let anyone through ? ’ he asked			0
‘ i do n’t know if you ’ve noticed but a lot of drivers do that line to get a good exit from the corner			2
the problem with @entity14 is he expected me to let him past			1
i do n’t think i ’m the only person he drove into today			0
with his car being so much quicker you ’d think he would n’t get into so many fights , but there you go			0
‘ he drove into my rear wheel			0
i ’m out there doing my race			0
it would make it boring if we all let him past when he was coming through the field			0
’ @entity84 was no more willing to yield than @entity89 , stubbornly defending from @entity14 in the closing laps			1
the @entity141 — who has long been rated highly by his boss sir @entity85 — is proving a fine driver in a car that is the best of the rest after @entity13			1
it was his third consecutive podium finish			2
he is outgunning his team - mate @entity147 , the little @entity148 who was again entangled in a spectacular crash			1
trouble behind : @entity1 leads the way as @entity147 crashes at the first corner out : @entity147 crashed in the first curve of the @entity8 @entity155 in @entity19 @entity156 : the high - speed crash saw @entity147 's car flipped upside down relief : the @entity148 seemed to be ok after the heavy collision with @entity161 heat of the moment : @entity164 was forced out of the race as his car burst into flames he was disputing the first corner with @entity161 when the two men collided			1
@entity147 was flipped over and skidded upside down along the asphalt for a second or two			0
‘ it is normally a guy who comes from @entity74 who causes this accident , ’ said @entity147 , in a classic case of finger - pointing			2
‘ i was in front			0
i was doing the corner in front of him			0
if anyone needs to watch , it is the car behind			0
’ @entity161 argued : ‘ if i ’d had somewhere to go , then there would n’t have been contact with @entity147			0
i did my best to try to avoid the accident but there was n’t much else i could do			0
’ the stewards investigated the incident but decided , not unreasonably , that it was a ‘ racing incident ’ undeserving of a punishment for either man			0
the race was threatened by rain throughout , but it was not until soon after the podium ceremony that it came			0
still , we were hardly starved of fun			0
we got another three abreast joust , this time with the @entity200 , @entity66 and @entity68 ’s @entity67 , and then a nip - and - tuck fight between @entity202 and @entity68			2
we held our breath when @entity205 ’s @entity204 was left in the middle of the track			0
surely the safety car would come out			0
but , no , it stayed there until marshals finally scampered on and pushed it away			0
lap 1 : three places gained on the opening lap lap 3 : passes @entity217 , pastor @entity218 and @entity219 to move up to 14th lap 4 : nails @entity221 to go 13th lap 7 : it ’s @entity205 next lap 13 : makes contact with @entity66 before barging his way past the @entity141 , then passes @entity68 on the same lap. a flurry of pit - stops means he is now 7th lap 14 : starting on the harder tyre has paid dividends			1
he is 5th after passing @entity231 lap 27 : pits for first time ; re-joins in 8th lap 30 : damages his front wing after banging wheels with @entity89 lap 31 : the damage is n’t terminal though , and he passes his former @entity88 team - mate lap 44 : pits and re-joins in 5th lap 49 : sees off @entity202 to take 3rd lap 51 : pits for a third time ; re-joins in 4th lap 56 : passes @entity202 again but ca n’t find a way past @entity84 ’ @entity85 and finishes third			1

@entity1 could *n't* be caught as he claimed victory at @entity19
@entity14 came from the back of the grid to finish third in @entity8
slips 14 points behind his @entity13 team - mate in the drivers ' standings
