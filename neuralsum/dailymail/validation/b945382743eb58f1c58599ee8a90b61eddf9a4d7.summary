boy @entity0 wants to build a glazed extension at his @entity3 listed property in @entity4 , @entity5 boy @entity0 's plans to build a lavish glazed extension onto his @entity3 listed @entity5 mansion have been turned down			1
the 53 - year - old applied to build the extension at his multi-million pound home in @entity4 in a bid to brighten up the property			1
according to his planning application , the @entity15 frontman also wanted to chop down three trees to allow more light into the @entity20 building			2
but @entity22 council rejected the proposals last september , saying the designs were an ' over-dominant and incongruous addition '			1
it added that they would be ' detrimental to the character , appearance and special architectural and historic interests of the hosted listed building '			1
the singer , who put the papers in under his real name @entity0 , is now appealing against the decision			1
the building works , filed under the singer 's real name @entity0 , would see new floor - to - ceiling windows installed to increase light			1
among the planned works were external and internal alterations to the ground floor front windows , a new side window , a new rear garden door and re-landscaping of garden			0
the garden landscaping would include the removal of three mature trees and the demolition of an existing summer house			0
but the designs were opposed by the @entity55 ( @entity56 )			0
a letter sent to the council by the group said the scheme was an over-development and would affect neighbours			2
they wrote : ' we object to the extension and the hard landscaping because of the garden take - up and potential light pollution			2
' as part of the plans , @entity69 , based in @entity70 , said : ' the house does not benefit from a great deal of natural light into its interior			0
its frontage is orientated to the north east			0
' the rear has a southwesterly orientation but a combination of factors mean that the interior often suffers from poor levels and quality of natural lighting			0
' camden council rejected the proposals for the @entity20 mansion ( pictured ) last september , saying the designs were an ' over-dominant and incongruous addition ' it added : ' the proposed extension has been designed to create living spaces with a greater sense of connection to the garden and better levels of natural light			1
these spaces will have a different atmosphere and character to the internal spaces in the existing house			0
' a planning inspector will consider written representations from both sides and is expected to make a site visit to his home before reaching a decision .			0
