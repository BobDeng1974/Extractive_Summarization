by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:19 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 17:20 est , 15 july 2013 the @entity3 father who killed his three young girls to get revenge on his ex-wife has been sentenced to life in prison without parole			1
a jury ruled that @entity12 - who called his wife saying ‘ you can come home now , i killed the kids ’ - was sane at the time of the july 2012 triple murder but he was only today that he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars			1
@entity12 , 35 , had admitted he killed 11 - year - old @entity21 , 8 - year - old @entity22 and 5 - year - old @entity23 at their @entity25 home to get back at his ex-wife , but argued he had a mental defect that kept him from knowing it was wrong			1
that was rejected by @entity54 circuit judge @entity53 , who said : ' i do n't see mental illness as a mitigating factor			0
' ' this is a vicious , aggravated crime , ' @entity53 said before handing down the sentence			0
the judge chose consecutive life sentences to send a message that ' each child is so important			0
' evidence showed that @entity12 texted his ex-wife on july 10 , 2012 , to ask for an unscheduled visit with the girls			1
she consented but said he had to be gone before she got home because she did n't want to see him			0
the girls ' baby sitter told investigators the children were excited when he arrived , and the sitter left			0
he called his ex-wife , @entity76 , about two hours later , saying : ' you can come home now , i killed the kids			1
' tragic lives taken too soon : @entity21 , 11 , five - year - old @entity23 and eight - year - old @entity22 ( left to right ) were all supposedly happy to see their father when he showed up for the unexpected visit police arrived to find the girls lying in their beds , their throats slit and their blankets pulled up to their necks			1
white t - shirts were tied around their necks			0
@entity23 's body also showed signs of strangulation			2
as he did throughout his trial , @entity12 sat impassively as family members and attorneys read their statements			1
@entity76 's sister , @entity99 , described @entity12 as ' the darkness , the boogeyman ' that every child fears			1
' he took their unconditional love for him , and used that love to lure them to get close enough ( to ) kill them , ' @entity99 said			0
' their last memory was what an evil killer their dad was			0
' @entity114 , the girls ' cousin , said @entity12 took away from her ' the future of seeing them smile , and what i had to look forward to when school got out			2
charged : lawyers for @entity12 , 35 , of @entity123 , @entity124 , initially tried to say that he was insane at the time of the triple murders but the court overruled that ploy ' i thought the world was a better place than this			1
not a place where someone got killed before they were even in kindergarten or middle school			0
' with family members crying and sharing tissues , lead prosecutor @entity137 read his statement , saying @entity141 used the girls ' as pawns ... to make @entity76 suffer			2
' ' how wrong is it to use his intellect , his size and his brute strength not to protect his children from danger , but to become the most dangerous person in the world to them ? ' he asked			0
@entity137 said consecutive life sentences with no possibility of release was the only way for @entity76 to be free of fear that her ex-husband would someday come for her			2
@entity12 argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his dependency on his ex-wife @entity76 , seen here in an old photo with their youngest daughter @entity23 as a baby happier days : the prosecution argued that @entity12 used his children ( @entity21 at left and @entity22 at right ) as pawns trial testimony showed that in the months leading up to the killings , @entity12 told several people he had thoughts of killing his daughters			1
his ex-wife testified that in march 2012 , he called her from @entity123 , @entity124 — where he was working — and told her he ' wanted to drive down there and tie me up and make me pick which child he killed and make me watch while he killed them			2
' he also called his ex-wife repeatedly , sometimes up to 30 times a day , and threatened to kill the man she was dating			0
@entity12 did n't testify at his trial			2
his defense attorney argued at trial that @entity12 has a rare mental disorder rooted in deep dependency on his ex-wife , and believed the only way he could ' solve ' his problem was to commit suicide or homicide			1
the jury rejected his insanity defense .			0

trial determined @entity12 , 35 , killed his three daughters - 11 - year - old @entity21 , 8 - year - old @entity22 and 5 - year - old @entity23 and was sane at the time
admitted that he slashed their throats to hurt his ex-wife @entity76
