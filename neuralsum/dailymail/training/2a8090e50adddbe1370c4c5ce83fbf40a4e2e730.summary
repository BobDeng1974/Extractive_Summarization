@entity0 has blamed the recent storms on the decision to legalise gay marriage a @entity6 @entity5 councillor has blamed recent storms and floods on the government 's decision to legalise gay marriage			1
@entity0 , who defected from the @entity12 last year in protest at @entity15 's support for same - sex unions , claimed he had warned the prime minister that the legislation would result in ' disasters '			1
the @entity21 - on - @entity22 town councillor , 73 , said the country had been ' beset by storms ' since the passage of the new law on gay marriage because mr @entity15 had acted ' arrogantly against the @entity28 '			1
in a letter to the @entity30 he wrote : ' the scriptures make it abundantly clear that a @entity33 nation that abandons its faith and acts contrary to the @entity28 ( and in naked breach of a coronation oath ) will be beset by natural disasters such as storms , disease , pestilence and war			1
' i wrote to @entity15 in april 2012 to warn him that disasters would accompany the passage of his same - sex marriage bill			2
' but he went ahead despite a 600,000 - signature petition by concerned @entity47 and more than half of his own parliamentary party saying that he should not do so			0
' blaming the prime minister for the bad weather , he added : ' it is his fault that large swathes of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods			2
' he has arrogantly acted against the gospel that once made @entity6 ' great ' and the lesson surely to be learned is that no man or men , however powerful , can mess with @entity65 with impunity and get away with it for everything a nation does is weighed on the scaled of divine approval or disapproval			2
' mr @entity0 wrote another letter to the @entity30 in april 2012 in which he told @entity15 not to legalise gay marriage and warned of ' disasters ' if he did @entity5 said the views expressed by mr @entity0 were ' not the party 's belief ' but defended his right to state his opinions			1
a party spokeswoman said : ' if the media are expecting @entity5 to either condemn or condone someone 's personal religious views they will get absolutely no response			1
@entity87 : part of the letter in the @entity30 , claiming recent floods were godly vengeance ' @entity103 or @entity104 or @entity105 or @entity106 or @entity93 or @entity94 or @entity95 or @entity96 or @entity97 or @entity98 or @entity99 or animist or any other mainstream or minor religion or movement , we are taught as a tolerant society to accept a diversity of ideologies			1
' freedom to individual thought and expression is a central tenet of any open - minded and democratic country			0
' it is quite evident that this is not the party 's belief but the councillor 's own and he is more than entitled to express independent thought despite whether or not other people may deem it standard or correct			2
' that is what makes the @entity6 such a wonderful , proud , diverse and free country			0
' @entity21 's @entity128 mp @entity127 , said : ' i thought mr @entity0 's letter was not the sort of thing that he should have written in today 's age			1
he really needs to consider his position			0
' @entity136 users have reacted angrily to the news , branding him a ' blithering idiot ' and questioning his position as councillor			0
@entity142 , a graduate from @entity143 , said : ' what is a man like @entity0 doing in public office ? disgrace			2
' another user calling himself @entity148 , from @entity149 , added : ' @entity5 councillor @entity0 says the floods are due to gay marriage			1
why do people take @entity5 seriously ? seriously , how ? ' the retired @entity154 worker , elected in 2010 , was unaware of the fury his letter had provoked when contacted by @entity157 today			2
he stood by the rant , saying he went to a @entity160 college in 2004 and studied the work of @entity162 , a controversial @entity163 psychologist who describes homosexuality as a treatable disorder , against the mainstream opinion of the medical world			0
since christmas eve several storms have left tens of thousands without power across the @entity6 , caused damage to homes and businesses and disrupted transport he said : ' the conservatives are known as the party of the @entity176			0
the queen in her coronation oath promised to only to pass those laws that are consistent with the @entity33 gospel			0
' there is a command to love all men , and i hope i love all men			0
' but we are also taught to love the person but hate the sin			0
' when told that hundreds of people had said his claim about gay marriage prompting floods was crazy , he said : ' that may be so if you are not a person of prayer			1
i am a person of prayer			0
i pray for each member of the @entity200 every day and each member of the royal family every day			0
' however , he admitted he ' lost a lot of friends ' when he left the @entity12 over gay marriage			1
@entity207 , spokesman for the gay rights charity @entity208 , told @entity157 : ' its hardly surprising that we 've seen unusual weather patterns in @entity6 , considering the enormous amount of hot air being produced by some @entity5 members ' .			1

@entity0 , 73 , wrote a letter to the @entity30 in @entity216
in it he said storms were @entity65 's punishment for legalising gay marriage
@entity0 , former @entity128 who defected over the issue , defended his views
activist : storms are hardly surprising considering @entity5 's amount of hot air
