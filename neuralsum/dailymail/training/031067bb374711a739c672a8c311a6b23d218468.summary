there must have been times in the five months since @entity2 paid @entity3 £ 16million to bring @entity4 back to @entity6 football that @entity7 has seriously questioned his sanity never mind his judgement			1
such has been the negligible impact made by the volatile @entity11 since august that it was a surprise to even see him on the bench on monday night			0
@entity4 ’s three - game absence had coincided with an upturn in fortunes at @entity17 that has lifted some of the pressure on the manager			2
it continued with a rampant @entity2 performance against @entity23 that was rewarded with a fine win for @entity7 ’s side , their biggest of the season			1
@entity2 scored four and could have had more			2
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 were excellent			0
@entity4 has struggled at @entity2 since his £ 16million switch from @entity3 this summer @entity4 ( right ) started their @entity33 match at home to @entity23 on monday night on the bench but it has not always been this way during a difficult season for @entity7 , of course			1
and , even in victory , the @entity39 could have been forgiven for watching @entity41 and thinking of what might have been			2
in the last @entity33 match of 2014 , the @entity44 hit - man was guaranteed to finish the calendar year as the leading scorer in the top - flight			2
when @entity2 were weighing up their options to replace @entity50 last summer , @entity41 was very close to the top of their list			1
not only did @entity23 ’s £ 12m record signing score 24 goals in his first season in @entity6 , it did not escape @entity7 and his staff that he held the ball up so well in both games against their team that it was almost impossible to get it off him			1
it was no surprise that @entity2 were prepared to activate the £ 20m buyout clause in @entity41 ’s contract last summer but his £ 100,000 - a - week wage demands proved to be too much of an obstacle			1
@entity23 striker @entity41 ( right ) was a summer target for the @entity68 after a great debut season in @entity70 @entity17 boss @entity7 was put off by @entity41 's £ 100,000 - a - week wage demands @entity41 ends the calendar year as the @entity33 's deadliest marksman with 20 top - flight goals having declined an opportunity to sign the @entity44 when he was given a two - week trial at @entity78 in 2007 by @entity79 , @entity2 once again decided to look elsewhere			1
what subsequently made little sense , however , was that they agreed to similar terms to sign @entity4 – a problem player who had left @entity83 18 months earlier more famous for the fireworks in his own bathroom than anything he was producing on the pitch			2
the results since have been largely predictable			0
@entity41 had scored eight goals in his last 12 games going into monday night ’s encounter			1
@entity4 had yet to score for @entity2 in the @entity33 , his two goals for the club coming against @entity94 in the @entity95 and a dramatic @entity97 comeback against @entity23 here back in october			1
no wonder he was sat on the bench last night alongside @entity100 and @entity101 , making an ineffective appearance late on			0
it is a continuing indictment of @entity2 ’s strikeforce in the absence of @entity106 , that @entity7 leaves them all out and ask @entity28 to lead the line so effectively			0
@entity41 ( right ) looks to shield the ball away from @entity109 - a quality that @entity7 admires if @entity2 can finally offload @entity101 for as little as £ 6m next month , they may opt to bring in a loan signing and then wait for the summer to make a permanent acquisition			1
it would be no surprise at all if @entity41 once again appeared on their radar , regardless of the fact he signed a one - year contract extension at @entity23 last month			1
there are few better strikers at holding up play and bringing teammates into the game			0
@entity41 will be sorely missed when he goes away next week on international duty at the @entity124			0
monday night , for instance , was not an easy one for him			0
there was little service and few chances – save for a snatched 30 - yard shot well over the bar – as @entity2 bossed the first half , leaving @entity41 an isolated figure			1
even then , he was a constant presence , often requiring two markers			0
but when @entity23 rallied after half - time , @entity41 suddenly burst into life			1
one powerful header brought a fine save from @entity138 and when @entity140 crossed towards him in the 52nd minute , there was instant panic in the @entity2 defence			0
@entity4 ( left ) came on as a late second half substitute for @entity28 during monday 's clash @entity4 ( right ) though failed to find the net against @entity23 as his goalscoring woes continue for @entity2 @entity147 won the header but did n’t really care where he was putting it , and only succeeded in teeing up a goal for @entity152			1
almost straight from the restart @entity41 forced @entity138 into another smart save from 20 yards that almost produced an equaliser for @entity140			0
@entity2 pulled away again to clinch a well deserved victory , helped in no small measure by a fatal misjudgement from @entity23 goalkeeper @entity159			2
@entity41 went off just after the hour mark , saved for another day			0
but even on a quiet night , he had made his impact felt			0
he might be back at @entity17 sooner than he thinks			0
bony waves to the travelling @entity23 supporters after the full - time whistle at @entity17			2

@entity2 won 4 - 1 at home to @entity23 in the @entity33 on monday
@entity4 has yet to break his @entity33 goalscoring duck for @entity2 since his £ 16million summer move from @entity3
@entity23 striker @entity41 has scored eight goals in his last 13 games
