the man @entity0 has picked to head his election campaign once launched a foul - mouthed rant against @entity3			1
outspoken @entity6 ‘ fixer ’ @entity4 used the phrase ‘ f * * * * * * @entity3 ’ in a diatribe while working for @entity11 mayor @entity10			1
but no 10 officials said the prime minister has no intention of changing his mind about appointing the strategist , despite the new revelations			0
in demand : @entity4 , pictured with @entity0 in april during the @entity11 mayoral campaign , has been recruited by the pm despite the racist allegations			1
@entity4 had previous success with @entity10 and former @entity6 premier @entity22 mr @entity4 ’s outburst came earlier this year as mr @entity10 ’s aides discussed whether to devote more attention to wooing the ethnic minority vote in his battle with @entity29 ’s @entity28			1
according to a source , mr @entity4 said mr @entity10 should concentrate on traditional @entity32 voters instead of ‘ f * * * * * * @entity3 ’			1
the source added : ‘ he definitely used that phrase ’ and said : ‘ @entity4 ’s view was that chasing the @entity3 vote and other ethnic groups was a waste of time – and he frequently expressed himself in very strong terms			1
some people found it very offensive			0
’ in a statement last night a spokesman for mr @entity4 said he had ‘ absolutely no recollection ’ of using the term			1
his allies claimed mr @entity4 was the victim of a dirty tricks plot by @entity32 enemies to stop him taking charge of campaigns at @entity32 hq			1
the spokesman said : ‘ it is entirely mischievous to suggest @entity4 is racist in any way			0
he campaigned vigorously for the @entity3 vote during the @entity59 race			2
he has absolutely no recollection whatsoever of making these comments			0
’ asked repeatedly if mr @entity4 had uttered the words ‘ f * * * * * * @entity3 ’ , the spokesman said : ‘ as i have said , he has no recollection of doing so			1
’ it is not the first time mr @entity4 , 55 , has been involved in a sensitive row over campaign strategy			2
the @entity6 objected to the way mr @entity10 ordered adverts to be removed from @entity11 buses which stated that gays could be converted to heterosexuality			1
sources close to mr @entity4 denied he was opposed to the adverts being taken down – but said he objected to the way the mayor briefed newspapers without discussing it with him first			2
the sources said it was totally untrue and an ‘ outrageous lie ’ to suggest mr @entity4 is either anti-gay or racist			0
mr @entity10 last night said he had ‘ no recollection ’ of being present when mr @entity4 made his ‘ f * * * * * * @entity3 ’ comment			1
he said his election chief was ‘ the soul of sweetness and kindness ’			2
fan : @entity10 urged @entity89 to give @entity4 a free hand and said he is the ' soul of kindness and sweetness ' and the mayor urged mr @entity0 not to reverse his decision to put mr @entity4 in charge of his election campaign			1
mr @entity10 said : ‘ @entity4 is the soul of kindness and sweetness and is not the reactionary caricature some have painted him to be			1
he is the best campaign manager anyone can hope for and i congratulate @entity32 hq for securing his services			2
’ a spokesman for the mayor added : ‘ @entity10 wants it known that @entity4 is not the ogre some make him out to be			1
’ asked to confirm the mayor was present when mr @entity4 referred to ‘ f * * * * * * @entity3 ’ , the spokesman said : ‘ the mayor has no recollection of the alleged conversation			1
the mayor would recognise that there were debates over the direction of strategy			0
what he would not recognise is any suggestion of abusive or offensive language directed at any particular group of voters from any member of his campaign staff			0
’ the damaging disclosure comes days after @entity32 chiefs secretly put the finishing touches to a deal whereby mr @entity4 and his @entity130 political polling company will take charge of the next @entity32 election campaign from january			1
the deal , said to be worth £ 200,000 a year was due to be announced in the next few days			1
success : @entity4 helped @entity22 , pictured , win the @entity6 election in 1996 when he served as @entity135 campaign director @entity136 - talking mr @entity4 , has been called ‘ the @entity140 ’ because of his legendary success in political campaigns , including winning four terms for former @entity6 pm @entity22			1
his supporters have called him one of the most brilliant political strategists of his generation			0
@entity144 , editor of @entity145 , wrote that the @entity32 ‘ needs him and needs him desperately			0
he will bring discipline , clarity and the toughness to the @entity32 operation that , at present , is so sorely lacking ’			0
but mr @entity4 has powerful enemies in the party			2
some @entity32 mps and no 10 advisers believe his advocacy of populist policies , and in particular his views on immigration , could lose votes			0
@entity32 deputy chairman , lord @entity160 took the unusual step of publicly warning mr @entity0 not to sign up mr @entity4			1
the peer said last month : ‘ i believe it would be a mistake to hire @entity4			0
not because it would lead to a re-run of the immigration - dominated 2005 campaign but because i do not think he is needed and would become a distracting influence			0
‘ far from ensuring a single strong manager , this is a recipe for the kind of conflict and confusion that dogged the 2010 campaign and helped cost us the majority we could have won			0
’ some insiders have suggested mr @entity4 ’s arrival marks a demotion for mr @entity0 ’s campaigns chief , @entity182 , a close confidant of @entity160			2
nor is mr @entity4 ’s appointment approved by all of mr @entity0 ’s advisers			2
head of strategy @entity186 , who played a key role in mr @entity0 ’s ‘ modernising ’ of the @entity32 away from its @entity191 image , is said to have voiced doubts – but he has denied threatening to quit over the hiring of mr @entity4			1
a source who has worked with mr @entity4 said : ‘ @entity4 ’s problem is that he only has one club in his golf bag			0
he goes on and on about immigration but there is much more to getting conservatives re-elected in 2015 than that			0
‘ @entity204 ’s defeat shows that a @entity205 can not win in the modern world by appealing to core voters only			0
you have to reach out to all groups			0
’ an ally of mr @entity10 said : ‘ @entity10 was not always comfortable when @entity4 talked about ethnic issues			1
’ mr @entity0 is believed to have sought assurances from mr @entity4 that he will not push the @entity89 back to the @entity205 if he takes charge of campaigns			1
mr @entity4 ’s most vocal @entity216 supporter is @entity217			0
the chancellor previously persuaded mr @entity0 to appoint former @entity220 editor @entity219 as his spin doctor – but mr @entity219 was later forced to resign over the phone - hacking scandal			0
the best : @entity10 , pictured , said @entity4 was the ' best campaign manager anyone can hope for ' if @entity4 is known for one thing , it is winning elections for right - wing political leaders by ruthlessly playing the immigration card			2
mr @entity4 , known as the ‘ attack dingo ’ , has become synonymous with ‘ dog whistle politics ’ – the repeated use of coded language which plays to the worst fears of certain voters			0
the term entered the political lexicon when mr @entity4 , running the @entity89 ’ 2005 general election campaign for leader @entity239 , is responsible for the slogan : ‘ are you thinking what we ’re thinking ? ’ he deployed messages such as ‘ it ’s not racist to impose limits on immigration ’ and ‘ how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter ? ’ on posters and mailshots			1
although the tactic failed to prevent a third term for @entity256 , many @entity89 believe it helped limit @entity29 ’s majority and provided the platform for revival under @entity0			2
as a result , he retains a loyal fan base in the party			0
born in 1957 in @entity263 , @entity264 , the economics graduate soon discovered he had a flair for advising parties on election - winning strategies			0
infamously , he was associated with claims in the 2001 @entity6 general election that asylum seekers had thrown children into the sea			2
@entity275 , foul - mouthed and a workaholic , ‘ the @entity140 ’ is blunt to his political masters			0
in the 2008 @entity279 campaign he told @entity10 : ‘ if you let us down we will cut your f * * * * * * knees off			1
’ the mayor of @entity11 has little doubt about mr @entity4 ’s abilities			2
this month he told @entity32 backbenchers they should ‘ break the piggybank ’ to hire him and give him a ‘ free hand ’ to take control of campaigning			2
those close to mr @entity4 are not offended by his plain speaking – and say it is all part of his charismatic personal style .			0

@entity4 used the phrase ' f * * * * * * @entity3 ' in diatribe while working for @entity11 mayor @entity10
