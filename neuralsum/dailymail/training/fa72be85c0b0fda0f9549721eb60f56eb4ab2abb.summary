they were supposedly selected for their business acumen and quick wits			0
but it seems some of @entity6 ’s latest acolytes could do with a refresher course in primary school mathematics			0
last night ’s episode of @entity11 ’s @entity10 saw two of its women candidates become completely befuddled by basic sums			1
lord @entity6 had set his contestants the task of making and selling scented candles and reed diffusers , used to perfume rooms			0
‘ this task is dead simple , ’ he said			2
‘ choose a nice scent , package it nicely and work out your costs and your margins			2
there is nothing much to understand in this			0
’ twin failures : both @entity19 and @entity20 found themselves fired by @entity6 on the @entity11 show half of these wannabe apprentices are about to be fired by an unimpressed @entity6 as team @entity51 prepared a batch of fragrance , @entity19 , 29 , and @entity20 , 36 , were left scratching their heads and yawning while colleague @entity56 , 27 , explained the maths on a whiteboard			1
he told them they had 60 reeds , each of which needed to be immersed in 100ml of scent			2
because 100ml of scent weighs 100g , they would require 6kg of scent			0
@entity68 said : ‘ i ’m completely lost			2
i just do n’t understand it			2
he ’s done all the intelligent bit			0
’ @entity20 added : ‘ i have n’t got a clue with the figures			1
i ’ve just got to trust in you			0
@entity56 ’s done all the hard work , bless him			1
’ to the evident dismay of @entity6 ’s aide on the show @entity79 , @entity20 added : ‘ he ’s done all the scientific bit and we just do the glamour			1
’ @entity68 , who has previously said she hates it when women are dismissed by chauvinistic men , agreed , saying : ‘ @entity87 , we ca n’t all be intelligent			1
’ lord @entity6 later fired them for their poor displays			0
not happy : @entity20 did n't take her firing as well as @entity19 and thought she should have stayed empty seat : accused of being ' just an empty seat in the team , ' @entity19 did n't argue and went further and instead of the usual bravado that has become the show ’s trademark , @entity68 conceded : ‘ i know i did n’t do well … if he had n’t have fired me i would have resigned			1
’ @entity20 added : ‘ i ’m not your type - a sort of person			1
i ’m a type - c sort of person			0

two *female* candidates became completely befuddled by basic sums
both women were *unconcerned* by their inability to do basic arithmetic
@entity20 told bemused @entity79 that a *man* did the hard work
@entity19 agreed , saying : ‘ @entity87 , we ca n’t all be intelligent ’
