by @entity0 published : 14:46 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 18:41 est , 16 october 2012 the judge who led the inquiry into mass murderer @entity3 is to head a @entity5 review into the @entity7 scandal			2
dame @entity8 will speak to the star ’s victims and explore whether the ‘ culture and practices ’ at the broadcaster ‘ enabled the sexual abuse of children to continue unchecked ’			1
former @entity17 chief @entity16 has been appointed separately to investigate the decision to drop a @entity20 investigation into @entity21 and to see if ‘ inappropriate managerial pressure ’ was applied			1
former high court judge @entity8 ( right ) and @entity23 executive @entity16 ( left ) are to lead the @entity5 's independent reviews stemming from the @entity7 sex abuse allegations a slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them a third independent review will look into sexual harassment claims which have surfaced in recent weeks			1
the @entity32 will see @entity8 investigate how much other staff knew of @entity21 ’s predatory behaviour and speak to those who claimed to have raised concerns within the @entity5 at the time			1
she will then consider whether the corporation ’s current child protection and whistle - blowing policies are ‘ fit for purpose ’ and what lessons need to be learned			0
the @entity43 will establish whether there were any failings in the @entity5 ’s management of the @entity20 investigation , and will consider whether the scheduled broadcasts of tributes to the dead presenter had any impact on the decision to drop the @entity54 probe			1
it will also look at how the broadcaster handled material ‘ derived from the investigation ’ which could have been of interest to police			0
announcing the inquiries , the @entity5 ’s senior independent director , dame @entity61 , said : ‘ these reviews will demonstrate the @entity5 ’s determination to open itself fully to scrutiny from independent experts , emphasising our belief that the basis of the public ’s trust is full openness and accountability			2
’ sex scandal : @entity7 at @entity75 's in @entity76 in 1987 dame @entity8 , 71 , previously led the multi-million pound @entity78 , which examined the activities of the @entity80 who was convicted of killing 15 elderly patients and suspected of murdering hundreds more			1
news of the @entity5 ’s inquiries came as ministers said they may order a full independent inquiry into the scandal			0
deputy prime minister @entity88 told @entity89 there was ‘ certainly a case for an inquiry ’ into the ‘ deeply shocking and troubling revelations ’			0
a senior @entity95 mp added that the @entity5 ’s new director - general , @entity96 , had questions to answer about why he commissioned tributes to @entity21 at a time when serious allegations about his conduct were being investigated by @entity20			1
@entity103 , chairman of the culture , media and sport committee which will quiz mr @entity96 about the scandal next week , described his apparent lack of curiosity about @entity20 ’s findings as ‘ very surprising ’			2
‘ you would expect that if he was told that @entity20 was looking at @entity7 that he would have asked what it was about in order to avoid precisely the kind of embarrassment the @entity5 is now in , ’ he said			1
‘ if it was shown that he was aware , particularly when he has told a press conference that he was n’t , then i think that would put him in a very difficult position			0
’ mps will also question mr @entity96 about the @entity5 ’s decision to shelve the @entity20 investigation			1
mr @entity88 said a wide - ranging police investigation should take precedence – but suggested a wider inquiry may also be needed if a series of internal @entity5 reviews fail to quell public disquiet about the scandal			0
police believe the @entity136 and television presenter 's alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades ‘ i constantly ask myself how on earth is this possible on such a scale over such a long period of time in so many different settings , ’ he said			0
‘ it is in many ways the sort of thing , the dark side of the cult of celebrity which maybe intimidated people from speaking out earlier			0
’ mr @entity88 ’s intervention came as @entity89 , including @entity151 leader @entity150 , warned that the @entity5 could not be left to investigate claims that senior managers turned a blind eye to allegations that @entity7 was abusing young women and children , sometimes on @entity5 property			0
@entity95 mp @entity159 , a fellow member of the @entity161 culture committee , last night urged the media watchdog @entity162 to investigate whether the @entity5 remained a ‘ fit and proper organisation to hold a broadcasting licence ’ in the light of the allegations			1
in a letter to @entity162 ’s chief executive @entity168 , he said it was ‘ inconceivable that nobody in senior positions [ at the @entity5 ] was aware of the allegations surrounding @entity21 or other inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour ’			2
@entity151 ’s @entity174 will meet mr @entity96 today to warn him that any inquiries into the scandal must look at the role played by managers and presenters , and must consider whether rules on sexual harassment are tough enough to prevent a repeat			0
the @entity5 last week announced separate inquiries into the @entity21 child abuse scandal			2

dame @entity8 will examine the ' culture and practices of the @entity5 '
