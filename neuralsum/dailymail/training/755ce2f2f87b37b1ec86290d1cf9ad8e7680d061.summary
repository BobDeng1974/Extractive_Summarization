schools will be pushed to breaking point as they struggle to find room for almost a million more pupils within the next decade , council leaders warned yesterday			2
the squeeze will reach ‘ tipping point ’ as schools lack the space or money to expand further , according to the @entity9			1
it said council taxpayers alone could not absorb the £ 12billion cost of an extra 900,000 primary and secondary places needed – and accused the government of failing to make up the shortfall			2
the warning triggered a political row last night as the @entity35 blamed @entity36 for previous spending cuts while allowing immigration to get ‘ out of control ’			0
labour in turn accused education secretary @entity42 of ‘ shocking complacency ’ by suggesting it was acceptable for class sizes to rise above 30			0
population projections suggest that the 7.14million children in @entity23 ’s schools will rise above 8million by 2023			2
many schools are already going to extraordinary lengths to find more room , converting old offices , shops and police stations – and even a double - decker bus			0
@entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , bought the vehicle for £ 5,000 on @entity59 instead of forking out ‘ astronomical ’ sums of up to £ 150,000 to expand the school			2
conservative minister @entity62 blamed the school places squeeze on the last @entity36 government 's failure to plan for the future the @entity9 's call comes just days before the january 15 deadline for mums and dads to apply for primary school places for this september			1
the organisation has warned that councils need extra help with funding ‘ before time runs out ’ applications are expected to be made for around 370,000 three and four - year - olds who are due to start school in the autumn			1
the @entity9 said town halls were ‘ pulling out all the stops ’ to ensure every child has a place but the scale of the crisis was ‘ too much for council taxpayers to pay for alone ’			1
there have been ongoing concerns about pressure on school places , particularly for primary - age children , fuelled in part in recent years by a rising birth rate			2
councillor @entity94 of the @entity9 said : ‘ we fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places , nor find the space necessary for new classes , if this crisis is not properly dealt with			1
‘ additionally , councils face a challenge creating places on time and in the right places when their hands are tied by red tape			0
' around 90,000 places were created in 2012/13 by councils , and more are being established - but the scale of the problem is too big to be solved at a local level , the @entity9 insisted			0
a survey by @entity36 suggests almost one in five primary schools is already full to bursting			0
but @entity35 schools minister @entity62 accused the last @entity36 government of failing to ‘ plan for the future ’ during a baby boom by cutting school place funding while allowing unchecked immigration			1
the @entity123 , he claimed , had put an extra £ 5billion into new places and spent £ 18billion improving buildings			1
education secretary @entity42 is under pressure to provide more school places amid a squeeze on the schools budget mrs @entity130 told @entity132 ’s today show that spaces would be provided by academies and free schools			1
‘ by the time we get all the free schools in the pipeline up and running , they will be providing over 200,000 new places across the country , ’ she said			2
the minister said she had visited a school that had ‘ more pupils than expected ’ but which was happy to absorb the increase			1
class size was important but so was the quality of education , she added			0
in 2013 , a study by the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) warned that by september 2014 an estimated extra 256,000 primary and secondary school places would be needed to meet demand			1
of these , 240,000 were required in primary schools , with more than a third ( 37 % ) needed in @entity156 alone			0
separate research conducted by the @entity158 last year concluded that hundreds of thousands of pupils could end up with less room to play outside because a squeeze on school places has meant classrooms are being built on playgrounds and playing fields			1
information on school expansions from 82 local authorities suggests that just over a third ( 35 % ) of primary schools that have grown or are due to grow in size will end up with less outdoor space for youngsters			0
a further 54 per cent are not due to lose space , but will have more pupils using the same area , the research found			0
sir @entity176 has warned that pupils could be ‘ disconnected ’ from nature if playing fields are built on to ease the school places crisis			1
the veteran broadcaster , 88 , warned against sacrificing grounds because they may be the only place children encounter the natural world – which he said is essential to the ‘ human spirit ’			0
in a campaign film for charity @entity190 , sir @entity94 said pupils must grow up to know and appreciate nature to understand why it needs to be protected			0
he added : ‘ and if they do not protect it – who will ? ’			0

*continuing* squeeze on places could lead to a ‘ tipping point ’ , warn councils
figures predict there will be 900,000 extra pupils in @entity23 's schools
town halls say they will need £ 12 billion to create enough school places
schools minister says @entity123 has given extra £ 5 billion for new students
