by @entity1 reporter published : 06:43 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 11 september 2013 when @entity4 decided to merge his two passions for clothes and cameras his goal was to take the art of fashion photography to new heights			1
so the @entity12 - based photographer flew around the world to source landscapes for the ' aerial ' project - before spending up to 12 hours painstakingly arranging designer garments to blend with his photographs			1
his series includes leafy apartments in @entity20 paired with green - checkered @entity22 boxer shorts , while rips in a pair of jean blend with clouds over @entity27			1
elsewhere a @entity29 train track blends seamlessly with a @entity31 jacket zip and the rolling sands dunes of @entity34 merge into the folds in a @entity37 sweater			1
pants : @entity12 - based @entity4 series includes leafy apartments in @entity20 paired with green - checkered @entity22 boxer shorts fashion shots : rips in a pair of jean blend with clouds over @entity27 two - track mind : elsewhere a @entity29 train track blends seamlessly with a @entity49 jacket zip @entity4 , 35 , explains : ' i shot all the aerial images during a couple of advertising jobs in @entity54 , @entity20 and @entity34 , where i spent several days flying around over all sorts of terrain in a helicopter			1
i could n't have done any of the pictures without the help of a couple of amazing helicopter pilots			0
' i showed the aerial pictures to a couple of friends , @entity65 ( art director ) and @entity67 ( stylist ) at a @entity70 streetwear magazine , and we came up with the idea of shooting a series mixing fashion and landscapes			2
tight knit : the rolling sands dunes of @entity34 merge into the folds in a @entity80 sweater buildings in @entity54 matched with a @entity83 t - shirt : he said showed the images to two friends at a @entity70 streetwear magazine , and together they came up with the idea of shooting a series mixing fashion and landscapes flying high : this is a hospital carpark in @entity54 mixed with a pair of @entity93 jeans			1
@entity4 shot all the pictures while working on an advertising job @entity96 in @entity54 and a k - way jacket : some of the compostions match the two images seamlessly ' that made an initial series of five doubles in 2012 , which was selected for the @entity103 in the @entity104 and had an @entity105 in the @entity106			2
' a few months ago @entity107 got in touch and asked if i could produce another series along the same lines , with their stylist @entity112			0
' with both series , i made a selection of aerial images which i thought would lend itself well to the concept , and the stylists then made suggestions as to fashion items which they thought could match / contrast well			0
buildings in @entity54 and an @entity123 shirt : others are n't quite so seamless but match nonetheless @entity29 road and a @entity127 watch : @entity4 clearly had more than a little time on his hands in between doing the advertising job a caravan in @entity131 and a @entity132 : he flew high above the earth in a helicopter to get the perfect shots no tricks : @entity4 said there was no retouching of the images apart from ' a little tweaking of the colour balances to get the two sides to work well together ' ' we made a shortlist together before the shoot , and spent a couple of days shooting the fashion in studio			2
very long days - the image of the desert & a sweater took about 12 hours to produce , making tiny adjustments to the lighting and the position of the folds in the material to match it up to the patterns of light and dark in the sand dunes			2
there was a huge amount of trial and error to get the pictures to match up just right			0
' there was no real retouching of the images , just a little tweaking of the colour balances to get the two sides to work well together			0
i shot almost everything with a medium format digital @entity173			0
