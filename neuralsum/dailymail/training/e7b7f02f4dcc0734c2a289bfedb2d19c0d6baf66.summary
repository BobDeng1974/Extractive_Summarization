by @entity0 published : 15:47 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 19:49 est , 1 january 2014 an injection that prevents breast cancer is being developed by scientists			2
in laboratory tests on mice , the jab stopped the disease in its tracks 75 per cent of the time			1
the scientists described their results as ‘ amazing ’ and said that by stopping the cancer before it starts , the injection could spare thousands of women the trauma of surgery and gruelling radiotherapy			1
' new approach ' : a jab has been developed that can in 75 per cent of cases block the development a very early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ , potentially sparking thousands of women from surgery @entity29 experts said the research was exciting but warned that the drug is still at an early stage			1
the main beneficiaries are likely to be women with a very early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ , or @entity38			1
it is diagnosed in almost 5,000 women a year in the @entity29 and involves changes in the cells that line the milk ducts			1
it only progresses to full - blown cancer in about half of cases			2
breast exam : ductal carcinoma in situ is diagnosed in almost 5,000 women a year in the @entity29 and involves changes in the cells that line the milk ducts but doctors ca n’t tell which women this will happen to , so most patients have to undergo surgery and some have the whole breast removed			1
women who have inherited genes that place them at extremely high risk of the disease – such as film star @entity64 – could also benefit by being given preventative jabs every six months			2
the actress underwent a double mastectomy last year after discovering she carries a faulty gene that gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
researcher @entity72 , of @entity73 in the @entity74 , said : ‘ right now , there is really nothing to give these people besides these drastic , cautious treatments			0
the findings open up the possibility of someday treating patients who have a genetic propensity for cancer			2
’ the drug does not help to prevent other types of breast cancer , as they will have progressed too far before they are spotted			1
dr @entity72 ’s team began by pinpointing a gene that fuels the early growth and spread of breast cancer			0
they then used genetic material known as small interfering @entity94 to shut down the rogue gene in cancerous cells in a dish			0
this partially reversed the cancer			0
when the drug was injected into mice destined to develop breast cancer , three - quarters of the animals remained healthy			1
by contrast , all of the untreated creatures were struck down by the disease , the journal @entity105 reports			0
mastectomy : women who have inherited genes that place them at extremely high risk of the disease - like film star @entity64 - could benefit from the treatment by being given preventative jabs every six months dr @entity72 described the results as ‘ amazing ’			0
he said : ‘ this provides a way of treating it early and preventing it ever getting there			0
’ the same approach could be used to tackle other cancers , as well as other diseases caused by genetic flaws			0
dr @entity72 added that it should be possible to refine the drug to make it even more effective			0
much more research is needed but , eventually , women with dcis or genes that put them at high risk of breast cancer could be given a six - monthly jab to keep the disease at bay			2
dr @entity139 , of @entity140 , said : ‘ this is an exciting new approach , although it ’s important to remember that it ’s only been done in mice so far and this kind of approach is still highly experimental			0

new *intravenous* drug *fights* development of ductal carcinoma in situ
in @entity29 5,000 women a year are diagnosed with the *condition*
the drug stopped three quarters of mice treated from developing cancer
