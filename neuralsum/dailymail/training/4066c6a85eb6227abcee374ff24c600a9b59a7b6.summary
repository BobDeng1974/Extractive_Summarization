number 40 , @entity1 , in south - east @entity0 is not your average @entity3 house			1

that 's because the two - floor property is actually an art installation made of wax bricks			1
entitled @entity18 ) , it is the brainchild of @entity20 artist and designer @entity19 , who is well known for creating optical illusions			1
he constructed the artwork ( whose name is a nod to a line from @entity47 ) from 8,000 cast paraffin wax bricks ' cemented ' between terracotta sand , which will slowly melt away over 30 days - and the structure is due to survive until this weekend			1
