by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 six players made their debuts as @entity5 hosted @entity6 on sunday , all looking to make an instant impact			1
@entity8 was the most high profile , facing his former club , though @entity11 missed out on that same chance			1
here , @entity13 takes a look at who impressed and who faltered in their first game			0
@entity5 @entity18 plenty of energy down the right - hand side , but was perhaps lucky to be let off in the lead up to @entity5 's opener			1
had the tricky task of keeping @entity25 quiet but did n't look out of place on his @entity28 debut			2
two - year loan may prove to be good , if not odd , business			0
a rugged centre - back whose instincts are to defend first and foremost , a rarity of late for a @entity5 defender			1
£ 20million may sound like a lot for a solid defender , but if @entity46 is worth £ 50m ... presence : @entity8 provoked cheers and boos every time he touched the ball , and was solid in defence @entity52 emotional debut at @entity38 for the 31 - year - old , albeit from the substitute 's bench			1
while his introduction may have culminated in @entity5 's winner , he did n't have enough time to truly make an impact			2
@entity6 @entity62 £ 10m is a lot to spend on a goalkeeper but after @entity62 's displays for @entity67 handed him a @entity69 squad , there was no more sought - after stopper in @entity71			2
could do nothing about @entity74 's goal , and made several solid saves as @entity5 dominated the first half			1
glove specialist : @entity62 may turn out to be a coup for @entity6 at £ 10m @entity79 struggled early on in the first half as @entity81 , @entity18 and @entity82 targeted the left - back			0
grew into the game though , and should prove to be a fine replacement for @entity86			0
@entity6 knew what they were getting when they loaned @entity79			0
a consistent , but young , performer who knows the @entity28 inside out			0
energetic : @entity79 impressed for @entity6 at left - back , making up for @entity86 's departure @entity25 the best of them all			1
@entity25 showed plenty of promise in the first half and was always willing to take his man on , but failed to deliver at times			0
come the second half the @entity100 winger really showed what he was about			0
drifting in from the left , his beautiful backheel flick set up @entity105 's equaliser			1
talented : @entity25 was instrumental for @entity6 on his debut , setting up their only goal @entity108 strikers who score plenty in @entity111 tend to struggle in @entity71 , and @entity108 's start to life on these shores could certainly have been better			1
looked languid up front , lacking movement , and was dealt with easily in the first period by @entity8			2
more impressive when midfielders and defenders ran off him , but never seemed likely to trouble @entity121 directly			0
static : @entity108 's movement was n't great on sunday , he may turn out to be another flop from @entity111 @entity127 thrown on when the going got tough , @entity127 will hopefully have more time to help justify that £ 12m fee in the future for the @entity6			2
missed a fine chance after @entity133 's effort hit the bar , heading wide with the goalkeeper down .			0

@entity25 set up @entity105 's equaliser at @entity38 and looked lively
@entity8 starts at heart of @entity5 defence against former club
@entity5 win game 2 - 1 *courtesy* of @entity74 and @entity145
@entity108 *disappointing* for the *visitors*
