by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 produced one of the best rounds of his career to surge into contention for the inaugural made in @entity10 event on saturday			1
@entity2 , who won the last of his two @entity12 titles in 2007 , defied winds gusting over 30mph to card a superb 66 at @entity14 to set the clubhouse target on six under par. he was later joined on that mark by overnight leader @entity18 , who had to wait until a medical emergency was dealt with on the 18th hole before being able to finish his round of 73			1
a male member of the television crew suffered a suspected heart attack and received treatment from on - site staff before being taken to hospital			2
made in @entity10 : @entity2 produced one of the best rounds of his career to go six under par ' the finish was difficult			1
nobody likes to see that kind of thing , ' said @entity18 , who initially waited to play his second shot before being allowed to move to the driving range along with playing partners @entity37 and @entity39			2
' no one likes to see an ambulance ( on the course )			0
golf is very much secondary when anything like that happens			0
@entity46 ( @entity12 chief referee ) came over and was talking to us and tried to make the right decision for everyone			0
' the gentleman needed some space for some treatment and we did n't want to be there while they were working on him			0
the gentleman is okay and hopefully he will make a full recovery			0
' success : @entity2 won the last of his two @entity12 titles back in 2007 @entity18 had been four shots clear at the halfway stage but struggled in the conditions and was three over par for the day before holing from 20 feet for birdie on the 17th			1
that ensured he finished alongside @entity67 and three ahead of @entity37 and @entity69 's @entity68 , with @entity39 another shot back on two under with @entity72 @entity71 and @entity74 's @entity73			2
@entity2 , who carded eight birdies and three bogeys , said : ' even driving here we could see the wind was a lot stronger than the first two days so we knew it was going to be a battle today			1
' obviously @entity18 was well ahead of me and the rest of the field and to be honest i was hoping it was going to be tougher because if it was easier he could maybe have the chance to pull away			0
test : @entity3 's @entity67 tests the wind , which reached 30mph at times ' overall i am absolutely delighted			1
i think 66 today , i probably could n't have hoped for that before i started			2
i started off and felt a wee bit of out of synch the first couple of holes , then hit a really nice second shot into the third and from then on just played really solid golf			0
' a lot of imagination was needed today and i enjoy that style of golf			0
' @entity2 flew to @entity10 after finishing joint 15th in the @entity102 at @entity103 last week and admitted the jet - lag was having an effect			1
' i was wide awake at half three last night , ' the 33 - year - old added			0
' it 's a whirlwind and you lose track of what 's going on , catching three flights to get here			2
i 've got the wife and son with me as well so whirlwind would be a good word to describe it			0
' local favourite @entity117 is five off the pace after a 73 and was full of praise for @entity2 's score , telling @entity121 : ' that 's up there with one of the best rounds i 've seen in a long long time			1
impressed : local favourite @entity117 was full of praise for @entity2 's performance ' it was literally impossible on some of those exposed greens to putt , your putter went all over the place and it was a very very difficult day out there			1
' earlier in the day , @entity69 's @entity130 had been forced to withdraw after being unable to make his third round tee time			1
@entity130 thought he had missed the halfway cut after consecutive rounds of 73 left him four over par and set off for home , only to discover in @entity137 airport that a bogey on his final hole from @entity140 - who was in the last group out on friday afternoon - had changed the cut from three over to four over			1
airport : @entity117 headed home thinking he had missed the cut only to realise his fortunes had changed the 35 - year - old then tried to get back to the course only to discover that his golf clubs had been mislaid in transit and he could not get back in time for his 7:40am start on saturday morning			1
the five - time @entity12 winner wrote on @entity153 : ' home after a nightmare 24hrs , left @entity156 for @entity137 , arrived , watched scores , made cut			2
@entity159 lost my clubs , missed flights back			0
' could n't get private jet , train , car or any other way back so came home ! at least i found my clubs this morning at @entity168			0

@entity2 carded 66 at first round of made in @entity10
@entity172 defied winds of over 30mph to go six under par
@entity117 said it was one of the best rounds he 's ever seen
