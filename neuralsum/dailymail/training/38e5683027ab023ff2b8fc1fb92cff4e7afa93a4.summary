in @entity1 , @entity0 have blasted their way to the top of the @entity4			0
in @entity6 , @entity5 are already a few strides ahead on their quest to regain the @entity10 title			0
in @entity15 , @entity14 's rising star @entity12 team are sitting pretty in first place			2
at the top of the @entity20 , these @entity18 giants are joined not by @entity21 , @entity22 or @entity23 , but by lowly @entity24			1
we are only four games into the new @entity20 season but @entity28 's rise to the top of the division is still remarkable			1
just 10 years ago , this tiny club was playing in the regional league			0
@entity28 's @entity33 celebrates after scoring his side 's second goal from 90 yards on saturday @entity24 's coach @entity36 celebrates with his team after their 3 - 0 victory over @entity39 @entity28 fans may even have expected to be bottom of the @entity20 but they 've done incredible so far when they achieved promotion to the @entity20 for the first time in their history last may , many expected them to remain rooted to the bottom of the table for a year			1
but their start has been explosive			0
four games , two draws , and two wins , including a 3 - 0 thrashing of @entity39			2
this is a club from a town of only 150,000 people			1
their @entity56 stadium has a capacity of just 15,000 , with only 5,000 of those in seated areas			1
when they line up against @entity64 on tuesday night , the entire market value of @entity24 's squad will be at about £ 20million – about half the value of @entity66			1
and yet it is @entity21 who are quaking in their boots			2
@entity64 legend @entity70 said this week that ' @entity21 are only slight favourites , and that 's only because they 're playing at home , ' while @entity73 did n't hesitate to express his admiration for @entity28			1
' we know why they are at the top of the table			0
they have no pressure on them			0
it 's not a surprise			2
' @entity24 's success story has been led by two figureheads			1
the first is club president @entity87 , a local furniture magnate who has pumped money into the club for nearly two decades			0
@entity28 's @entity33 controls the ball with his chest on the edge of his own area on saturday @entity96 smashes the ball from 83 yards in the direction of the @entity39 goal the @entity39 keeper watches forlornly as the ball rolls into the goal @entity87 is characterised first by a slightly ruthless leadership , but also by an impressive football savvy			1
his managerial appointments have almost all been successful , with many , such as @entity106 and @entity107 , going on to bigger clubs			0
the latest in that line is current coach @entity36			0
a far cry from the cult of the individual which surrounds @entity73 and @entity114 , @entity36 is a measured , considered manager			0
his tactical flexibility and his players ' mentality have been the foundation stones for the team 's early success			2
' we do n't have a specific system , it is always about working out the best way to play against a certain opponent , ' says @entity36			0
' i know that our boys go out together in the evenings , and that shows that this is n't about 10 or 12 players playing well , it is about the whole team			2
' for while individual players such as @entity137 and @entity33 have stood out for the goals they have scored , it is the team effort which has set @entity24 apart			1
as they line up against @entity21 on tuesday evening , they know they are light years behind in terms of individual quality			1
but if they play as fearlessly as they have done so far , a shock result is no longer too hard to imagine			0
@entity73 will face current @entity24 coach @entity36 on tuesday night at the @entity148 @entity73 and @entity22 boss @entity114 do n't top the @entity20 - unbeaten @entity24 do			1

@entity24 remain unbeaten in the @entity20 after four games and face @entity21 at the @entity148 on tuesday night
@entity28 's team are worth about £ 20million - half that of @entity66
@entity24 achieved promotion to the @entity20 for the first time in their history last may and plenty expected them to remain rooted to the bottom
the town has just 150,000 people , and their @entity56 stadium has a capacity of 15,000 , with only 5,000 of those in seated areas
