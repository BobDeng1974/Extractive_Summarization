by @entity0 after the ignominy of @entity4 ’s early exit from the @entity5 , @entity1 showed his father @entity7 how it should have been done during a kick - about on the beach in @entity10			1
the four - year - old was seen in tears after watching @entity4 lose to @entity13 on thursday , but he bounced back to show off his own footballing skills on @entity16 beach in @entity17 , watched by his mother @entity18			1
in contrast , his father appeared despondent as he and goalkeeper @entity21 braved a press conference yesterday to apologise in person to travelling fans for the team ’s dismal performance			1
he shoots ! he scores ! @entity27 hits the back of the net			0
only this time it 's @entity1 not daddy @entity31 @entity1 does n't let a bit of sand stop him from giving his all in this game of football working out with his trainer : @entity1 gets his arms strengthened by his physio aka mother @entity18 @entity27 said it was ‘ very disappointing … and it ’s not a great feeling to go out of the tournament after two games ’			1
he earlier posted on @entity44 : ‘ going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it has n’t worked out			1
sorry to all the fans who travelled and at home that we have n’t done better … gutted ! ’ other players offered similar sentiments , with @entity53 midfielder @entity52 tweeting : ‘ gutted does n’t come close to how i am feeling right now			1
sorry to all the fans who came out and supported us , and everyone back home ! ’ following their elimination , the players mooched around their hotel , the @entity60 , on friday night – although manager @entity61 enjoyed a burger and chips and bottles of @entity65 with @entity67 chairman @entity66 and coaching staff in an @entity70 diner			2
afterwards , the big question of the day was not how to rebuild his shattered squad but which ice cream to select			0
@entity61 questioned the waiter at length about the flavours and possible combinations , pondering his decision as if considering who to play up front			0
back at the hotel , @entity61 , @entity66 and @entity81 settled themselves in a corner of the bar and drank wine , calling it a day at just gone 11pm			0
earlier , during the @entity89 - @entity88 match , @entity61 looked careworn			0
@entity89 needed to beat @entity88 to give his boys a slither of hope of remaining in the @entity5 but lost 1 - 0			0
daddy 's turn : an understandably dejected @entity27 faces the press ahead of @entity4 's meaningless game against @entity88 pensive : @entity4 goalkeeper @entity21 ( left ) , and @entity27 wait for the first question at a press conference after a squad training session ahead of the game against @entity88 the joy of scoring his first @entity5 goal for @entity4 can not hide @entity27 's unhappiness at the post-training press conference along with @entity66 , most of the players and the backroom staff , the 66 - year - old @entity4 manager watched the game on a giant screen in the hotel ’s heavily guarded conference room			1
@entity66 was the first to appear as the final whistle signalled the end for @entity61 ’s boys			2
this was the man who appeared to demonstrate his view of @entity4 ’s chances by making a throat - slitting gesture when the draw was announced last december			1
this time , he threw his hands up in despair and sighed deeply			0
‘ could have done without that , ’ he said			2
@entity127 came @entity61 , who , when asked how the players were bearing up , bit hard on his bottom lip before saying : ‘ bit disappointed			0
’ @entity132 defender @entity131 , 18 , admitted later : ‘ it ’s horrible , just horrible , the worst feeling of my life			2

@entity1 , 4 , was in tears after watching @entity4 lose to @entity13 on thursday
father @entity7 and @entity21 apologised to travelling fans for team ’s dismal performance
@entity53 's @entity52 was also *apologetic* : ‘ @entity145 does n’t come close '
