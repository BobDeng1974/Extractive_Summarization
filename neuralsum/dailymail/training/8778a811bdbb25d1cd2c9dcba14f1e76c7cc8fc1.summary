lawsuit : @entity1 has threatened to sue the website @entity3 for millions of dollars after they accused her of being a sexual abuser last week @entity1 is now threatening to sue the right - wing website which last week published an article claiming she sexually abused her little sister when they were children			1
the claim is based on an excerpt from the @entity12 star and creator 's new book , @entity15 , and details how she once looked at her sister @entity17 's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven			1
@entity1 defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity , but the website @entity3 called the memory ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing '			1
since then , she has been in a war of words with the site , which refused to take down or apologize for their piece titled ' @entity1 describes sexually abusing her little sister '			1
on tuesday , the website claimed that the actress was threatening to sue them and that was confirmed today when @entity33 published the full cease and desist letter written by @entity1 's lawyers			1
in the letter , attorney @entity37 calls the @entity3 article ' completely false and fabricated , and highly defamatory of ' his client			2
he goes on to demand the website take the article down and apologize for it , or else face a multi-million dollar lawsuit			0
if they do n't follow instructions to take the article down , @entity37 says @entity1 will ' vigorously pursue all legal remedies '			2
the website adamantly declined , and editor @entity47 wrote another article on tuesday explaining why they would not heed to the demands of @entity1 's lawyers			1
we refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it , because quoting a woman ’s book does not constitute a “ false ” story , even if she is a prominent actress and left - wing activist			2
' @entity1 may not like our interpretation of her book , but unfortunately for her and her attorneys , she wrote that book – and the @entity63 covers a good deal of material she may not like , the article reads			2
the claim is based on a personal essay included in @entity1 's new book the passage that @entity3 excerpted details a conversation that then 7 - year - old @entity1 had with her mother , famed artist @entity79 , about women 's organs			1
in the course of the conversation , young @entity1 asks her mother if little sister @entity17 's vagina looks like hers			1
' i guess so , just smaller , ' her mother responds ' one day , as i sat in our driveway in @entity90 playing with blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the best of me , ' @entity1 writes memory : in @entity95 , @entity1 writes about looking at her then 1 - year - old sister @entity17 's vagina out of curiosity after talking with their mother about the female reproductive system			1
@entity1 was seven at the time			2
@entity101 pictured at a film screening last june ' @entity17 was sitting up , babbling and smiling , and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina			2
she did n’t resist and when i saw what was inside i shrieked			0
' my mother came running			0
“ mama , @entity107 ! @entity17 has something in there ! ” ' my mother did n’t bother asking why i had opened @entity17 ’s vagina			2
this was within the spectrum of things i did			0
' she just got on her knees and looked for herself			0
it quickly became apparent that @entity17 had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there			0
my mother removed them patiently while @entity17 cackled , thrilled that her prank had been a success			0
' it was also in the book that @entity1 described coaxing her sister for affection			1
' as [ @entity17 ] grew , i took to bribing her for her time and affection : one dollar in quarters if i could do her makeup like a ' motorcycle chick			0
' three pieces of candy if i could kiss her on the lips for five seconds			0
' whatever she wanted to watch on tv if she would just ' relax on me			0
' basically , anything a sexual predator might to do woo a small suburban girl i was trying			0
' @entity69 called this passages ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing ' in an article titled ' @entity1 describes sexually abusing her little sister ' the article reads : ' @entity1 describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister @entity17 , whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “ anything a sexual predator might do			1
” in one particularly unsettling passage , @entity1 experimented with her six - year younger sister ’s vagina			1
' they also originally wrote that @entity1 was 17 at the time of the incident , and later added a correction saying ' this article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing @entity1 's age as seventeen '			1
@entity1 initially addressed the claims in a @entity160 rant over the weekend , and spoke out against the story again on tuesday with a statement to @entity163 , writing how she was ' dispayed ' with the interpretation of the story			0
' first and foremost , i want to be very clear that i do not condone any kind of abuse under any circumstances			0
' childhood sexual abuse is a life - shattering event for so many , and i have been vocal about the rights of survivors			0
' if the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read , i am sorry , as that was never my intention			0
' i am also aware that the comic use of the term “ sexual predator ” was insensitive , and i ’m sorry for that as well , ' @entity1 writes , adding that her sister is her best friend and supported her publishing the childhood memory in her book			1
in the wake of the allegations , @entity1 has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in @entity190 and @entity191 claiming she is having health issues			1
on monday , she tweeted that she was ' deeply sorry ' to miss the @entity193 and a signing in @entity195 , adding that she 's ' so grateful for your energy and support '			0
sibling support : @entity101 has spoken out to defend her sister 's story and her right to write about childhood memories			2
the sisters pictured above in @entity205 on october 29 , promoting @entity1 's new book the website has refused to apologize for the article			1
do you find anything wrong with @entity1 's childhood actions ? do you find anything wrong with @entity1 's childhood actions ? now share your opinion ' if ms. @entity1 says that our quotations from her book were “ false , ” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law , then we look forward to asking her , in her deposition , about why they appeared in her book , ' editor @entity47 wrote on tuesday			1
' we also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28 - year - old woman to make light of opening her baby sister ’s vagina , paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “ sexual predator , ” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister , ' he added			1
@entity101 also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own @entity160 rant on monday , writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered ' normal ' behavior			0
@entity17 writes that she supports writers ' narrating their own experiences , determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful '			0
she also posted : ' 2day , like every other day , is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women , queer , and trans people			0
' while the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister 's essay , they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world			1
the sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the @entity3 article , according to one tweet @entity1 wrote on saturday			2
' sometimes i get so mad i burn write up			0
also , i wish my sister was n't laughing so hard , ' @entity1 tweeted on november 1 .			2
