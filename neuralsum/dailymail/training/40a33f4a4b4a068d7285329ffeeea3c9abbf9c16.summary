by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 30 march 2013 at first glance , these may look like piles of rubbish cluttering up the canals of @entity6			0
but these are three boats made entirely from salvaged junk - including plywood , motors and bedding			0
after six months of gathering materials and shipping them to @entity15 , a team of artists and performers built the boats and set sail to attend the prestigious @entity19 art show , even though they had n't been invited			1
their aim was to show that anything could be built even if you only had the idea			1
the @entity25 project was the idea of @entity27 , better known as the @entity29 - based street artist @entity28			1
street artist swoon led a team who built three ' floating sculptures ' of of junk and sailed them into the prestigious @entity19 the ships of scraps , photographed by @entity37 , were built in @entity15 before the crews embarked on the voyage to @entity6 after arriving in @entity6 the group , made of puppeteers , musicians and performers , spent a fortnight entertaining crowds gathered for the @entity19 each collaborator was picked for their skills , including carpentry , engineering and performance @entity29 - based artist swoon came up with the idea for the @entity25 trips , starting with ventures down the @entity56 and @entity57 rivers before tackling the trip to @entity6 @entity28 , whose work is on show at the @entity61 in @entity62 , had previously led teams of friends and collaborators down the @entity56 and @entity57 @entity66 on ' floating sculptures ' made out of discarded junk , including wood , bedding and car parts			1
but the project to sail into the @entity19 show was nearly scuppered by @entity15 customs officials who were not sure whether to believe that 40ft containers filled with junk were going to be turned into art rather than dumped on the country 's shores			1
after getting their containers back , the team of 30 artists , musicians and performers had enough material to build two rafts and planned to make a third out of what they could salvage in @entity15			1
the scavenging began in december 2008 , six months before the ships were ready to set sail			0
each crew member was picked for their skills , including carpentry and engineering			0
anyone who joined the team had to follow the ' sack of potatoes ' rule and bring equivalent food supplies on board			2
they turned discarded barrels , scraps found in skips , crates and sheets of plywood into boats which made the 130 - mile voyage to @entity6 , with plenty of stops for scavenging			0
the rafts were powered by modified @entity115 car motors that ran on biofuel and had long - tail propellers			0
the @entity25 of @entity118 arrived in @entity6 for the @entity19 without an invitation it was all hands on deck for the @entity25 crew , who salvaged every piece of the boat anyone who wanted to the join the crew had to follow the ' sack of potatoes ' rule and bring supplies collaborators on the project included friends of @entity28 who were artists and performers the team collected a ' cabinet of curiosities ' on their travels which formed part of their show they ' docked ' for a fortnight of street performances , puppetry and music and showed off a ' cabinet of curiosities ' made of objects they found on their journey			1
@entity28 told @entity151 that the ' vilest and strangest thing to come aboard has been a dog pelt '			1
she said : ' we ’ve had kindergartners singing to us , families cooking us dinners that they haul to the docks in ten - gallon buckets , and amazing old ladies bringing lace for our show and fixing our sewing machine			2
the @entity6 trip was almost held up by @entity15 customs officials who were n't convinced at first that the 40ft containers full of junk were going to be turned into art everything from car parts to plywood and bedding became part of the boats the crew 's journey from @entity15 to @entity6 made frequent stops for gathering materials ' this level of human connection and support has never happened in any of my other artistic projects , and it is so touching			2
' on their @entity186 site , the team said : ' to the real life crew , the boats were a place of refuge – both a home and a way of moving through the world			2
' to those who encounter the boats for the first time , they were a reminder that anything that can be imagined can be built			0
' every person on board helped with ship life , whether steering or feeding the crew the boats were sturdy enough for crew members to set up a swing			0

the @entity25 project was led by street artist @entity28
she and her team docked at the @entity19 art show and performed
