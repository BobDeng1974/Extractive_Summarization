@entity8 , 29 , had been drinking cans of lager with friends at a football match then went to a friend 's house where a group of men were drinking shots of fortified wine			1
a friend recalled mr @entity8 being ' full of bravado ' and pouring a bottle of rum into a pint glass and downing it in one , an inquest heard in @entity25			1
mr @entity8 was taken to @entity26 in @entity25 but died five days later on march 29 this year he fell asleep on the sofa and appeared to be snoring but about 2am his pals noticed he was a different colour and called an ambulance			1
mr @entity8 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , a keen sportsman who regularly undertook charity events , was taken to @entity26 in @entity25 but died five days later on march 29 this year			1
he sustained a severe brain injury caused by cardiac respiratory arrest			2
@entity32 coroner @entity37 said his alcohol level was 379 mg per 100 mls of blood which was almost five times the legal limit for driving			1
it would have caused him to fall into a deep sleep , stifling his cough reflex and causing his stomach contents to enter his lungs			0
he said : ' @entity8 was a very bright and charming man who excelled in everything he did , especially in his work			1
he had a great love of sport and retained his friendships right from infant school into adulthood			0
' he strikes me as a man who enjoyed life			0
very sadly on this occasion he very foolishly had a great deal to drink , not just a few pints but to actually drink neat rum in the quantity he did pushed his blood level to within a fatal range			0
' he said his death should act as a warning to others			0
mr @entity37 said : ' he did it but did n't intend the outcome			2
it was just a group of young men having a few drinks with a bit of rivalry and bravado and i suspect he liked to be at the centre of things and he did it for a laugh			2
' i 'm not convinced people know how dangerous alcohol can be			0
when people are consuming alcohol to that level it has this effect			0
' it is a warning to others that what seems like a laugh at the time can have very serious consequences			0
' mr @entity37 recorded a verdict of misadventure .			2
