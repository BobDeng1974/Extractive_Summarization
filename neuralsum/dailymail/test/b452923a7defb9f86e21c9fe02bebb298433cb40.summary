the actor believes the controversial church is targeted ' because it 's not understood '			1
and despite allegations that he has been blackmailed by the elders to remain in the congregation , he insists : ' i 've loved every minute of it			1
' his words came in an interview with @entity12 to promote his new thriller @entity13 about the world 's most infamous art plagiarist			1
but amid questions about the 61 - year - old 's penchant for oil painting , interviewer @entity16 brought up going @entity21 , the explosive new documentary that alleges church elders have a ' blackmail file ' of ' damaging material ' from @entity0 's sessions with auditors			1
' i 've loved every minute ' : @entity0 smiled as he spoke out in defense of his controversial religion ' it 's helped me save lives ' : the 61 - year - old actor insists the church is not as evil as it has been depicted he fielded the questions about @entity1 during a press stop on his promotion tour of his movie @entity13 dismissing the claims , @entity0 said it has been a support system for his family for four decades , particularly as he mourned the death of his 16 - year - old disabled son @entity41 in 2009			1
' my family has done so well with it , ' he said			0
' it 's been a beautiful thing for me			0
i 've saved lives with it and saved my own life several times			2
' through my loss of my son , it helped me every step of the way for two years solid , and here i am			2
' he urged critics to ' take time and read a book			1
' ' you could read a new slant on life , you could read @entity61 , ' he said			2
' and i think if you really read it , you 'll understanding it			2
but unless you do , you 'll speculate and i think that 's a mistake			0
' the film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison - style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave @entity1			1
others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity78 's @entity77 in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church , it was claimed			0
the claims have been disputed by the @entity83 who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as ' admitted ' liars and perjurers and ' professional anti-scientologists			0
' directed by @entity90 , going @entity21 aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including @entity0 and @entity94			1
controversy : the documentary going @entity21 alleges that church elders have a ' blackmail file ' from @entity0 's sessions with auditors that will stop him ( pictured right with his wife @entity102 ) and his family from leaving the church dismissing the claims , @entity0 said it has been a support system for his family for four decades , particularly as he mourned the death of his 16 - year - old disabled son @entity41 in 2009 it included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated			1
these included descriptions of a ' prison camp ' , revealed by former member @entity121			0
people put into this camp are forced to do around 30 hours of hard labour , broken up by three hour rest breaks			0
@entity126 was once the point of contact between the @entity83 and @entity0 and said she was sent to this ' prison camp ' , known as the @entity131 which , she claims , is where members are ' reindoctrinated			2
' the documentary also claimed @entity1 chiefs hold a ' black pr package ' on @entity0 , with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions			1
during these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as ' what are you willing for me to talk to others about ? ' @entity0 is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed , but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway			1
as well as the claims about @entity0 , former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders			1
big names : @entity0 and @entity94 are pictured together at a @entity1 session in the front row another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the @entity1 church , @entity163 , whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in ' @entity165 '			1
as well as beatings in ' @entity165 ' , they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force them to confess their crimes against the @entity83			0
others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity78 's @entity77 - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church , with losers being expelled			0
being expelled from the @entity83 comes at a high price , because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members			0
@entity1 is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of @entity94 's marriage to @entity191 because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter @entity192 to @entity163 , according to reports at the time			2
in an interview with the @entity197 in 2012 , @entity1 spokesmen denied the claims			2
the @entity83 , which is believed to have around 50,000 members , denied the allegations featured in going @entity21 and said the statements included were ' entirely false			2
' people interviewed in the @entity204 documentary included @entity205 , who has dissented from the church in a statement it said : ' the church has documented evidence that those featured in @entity90 's film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims			1
all have been gone so long from the @entity83 they know nothing of it today			0
' yet @entity90 and @entity204 stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the @entity83 to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with first - hand information eager to speak			0
to this day , neither @entity204 nor @entity90 can deny that they have yet to present the @entity83 with a single allegation from the film so the @entity83 may have an opportunity to respond			0
the @entity83 never sought special treatment , only fair treatment			0
' since going @entity21 premiered at the @entity233 in january , the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version , called ' get the truth			1
' representatives also branded the documentary a ' bigoted propaganda piece			0
' other famous members have also criticised the show			0
@entity243 , a second generation scientologist and former star of ' @entity245 ' , said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies			2
he told eonline : ' i wonder if @entity233 would allow a documentary of , like , eight people who hate @entity253			0
but you know , my religion 's fair game , i guess , " cause it 's new "			0
' at the end of the documentary @entity90 lists the people who refused to be interviewed , which included @entity262 , @entity0 , @entity94 and @entity263 .			1
