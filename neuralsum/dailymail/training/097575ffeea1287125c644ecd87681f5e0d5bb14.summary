by @entity0 the net is closing in on a world renowned former cricketer after a @entity5 captain @entity4 revealed he had been approached to fix matches			1
@entity7 has learned that @entity4 told @entity9 anti-corruption investigators a player offered him up to £ 107,000 to underperform			1
it is thought to be the same player for whom former @entity5 test batsman @entity13 admitted fixing matches in both county cricket and in the short - lived @entity16			1
@entity4 ’s claim will send further shockwaves through the game , particularly in @entity20 as the batsman said his ‘ hero ’ tried to bribe him in a @entity23 cafe during @entity5 ’s tour in 2008			1
uncovered : @entity5 captain @entity4 was approached to fix matches the detail of @entity4 ’s evidence includes how the former star told him how to fix by batting slowly and to hide the money trail by buying property through an employee of the @entity9 , the world game ’s governing body			1
the star also told him that ‘ the big boys ’ in international cricket were doing it			1
@entity4 was first approached in 2008 in @entity38 before the start of the inaugural @entity40			1
he told investigators that the star telephoned him to meet at his hotel to discuss a ‘ business opportunity ’			2
‘ we spent some time talking about various things over dinner , ’ @entity4 told investigators			1
‘ during the course of this conversation he asked me if i knew what spread betting was in cricket games			2
i told him not really , so he took a piece of paper and wrote down and explained the process to me			0
shockwaves : the @entity5 batsman said he was approached by a cricket ' hero ' ‘ i was really shocked as i saw @entity61 as a good friend and it totally confused me			1
@entity61 said that everybody was doing this in games			0
‘ he said that the “ @entity68 ” in international cricket were doing it and he did n’t want me to miss out			1
i am sure that he mentioned names to me but i can not remember , although i seem to think that @entity61 mainly mentioned @entity73 cricketers			0
using the piece of paper @entity61 explained the basic principles which were to score below a certain rate for the first six or so overs and then towards the end of the game there was another split			0
@entity61 told me he had done this himself			0
‘ [ @entity84 ] told me that potentially he could get for me from between $ 70,000 - 180,000 ( £ 42 - 000 - £ 107,000 ) a game			2
‘ @entity61 told me he had a good group working for him in the @entity16 and i understand this to mean fixing for him			0
it was my opinion then , as it is now , that @entity61 was actively concerned in fixing ... i believed he was asking me to do the same thing for him in the @entity40 as others were doing in the @entity16			0
’ @entity4 asked the man how he was able to take money back to @entity5 without raising suspicion			1
local : @entity4 was approached in @entity23 during @entity5 's tour of @entity20 in 2008 ‘ @entity61 told me that you do n’t take or send it back to @entity5			1
he explained that he had a man in @entity98 who was associated with cricket			0
through him you purchase a property in @entity98 which you retain for a couple of years before selling it			0
‘ the money could then be moved wherever you want to send it because to all intents and purposes , it would appear to be profit from property deals rather than fixing			0
@entity61 told me the name of that man in @entity98			0
’ despite @entity4 saying he has ‘ never , ever fixed ’ he did n’t have the courage to say no immediately and instead said he would think about it before returning to his hotel in a ‘ state of shock ’			2
later the star telephoned him and @entity4 told him he was not interested			2
‘ he was a hero who became a friend so i always found it difficult to say no , ’ @entity4 said			2
lifting the lid : @entity13 revealed that he played in at least 12 fixed games it was a matter of weeks before the superstar tried to coerce @entity4 again			1
after his stint in the @entity40 , @entity4 joined the @entity5 squad in @entity20			1
‘ we were staying in @entity23 and he called asking to catch up			2
he said he was just down the road and suggested we meet for breakfast			0
i thought it strange he was in the area			0
@entity61 asked if i ’d changed my mind and i knew he was talking about fixing			0
i told him i had not			0
’ @entity4 could be charged by the @entity9 for failure to report an approach to fix as it is a breach of the corruption code			2

@entity5 captain was offered over £ *100,000* to fix games
@entity4 says he was approached by a cricket ' hero '
the batsman was contacted while in @entity23 in 2008
hero told @entity4 the ' big boys ' in international cricket were doing it
