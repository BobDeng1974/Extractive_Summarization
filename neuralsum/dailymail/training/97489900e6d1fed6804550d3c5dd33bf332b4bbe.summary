by @entity0 for @entity1 a military buff who owns 20,000 toy soldiers and 600 model aircrafts in what is believed to be one of @entity9 's largest collections of @entity11 memorabilia wants to open a museum - because his wife says the house has become ' too full '			1
@entity15 , 59 , has spent nearly 50 years amassing the £ 70,000 hoard , which includes 700 model military vehicles , 40 real and de-activated guns , grenades , badges , and even a reproduction flame thrower			1
but now his wife @entity22 , 48 , whom he married last year in a 1940s - style ceremony - complete with a guard of honour - said he needs to remove the collection from their home in @entity28			1
@entity15 , 59 , has spent nearly 50 years amassing one of @entity9 's biggest collection of @entity11 memorabilia at his home in @entity28 but the @entity11 buff , pictured above in a @entity35 uniform , is now looking to open a museum to house the collection , after his wife @entity22 said the house was ' too full ' his stash - which includes three bazookas and 13 full sized mannequins dressed in various uniforms - has become so big that she can not even draw the curtains in their sitting room			1
she said : ' i do n't really mind it that much			0
my dad was the same , he was a squadron leader in the @entity48 and he had lots of wartime memorabilia too , but he had to keep his in the loft			0
' but the house is getting too full now			2
i would like to have enough room be able to draw the curtains in the sitting room			2
' mr @entity15 , who has seven children , first began collecting the memorabilia when he was aged 10			1
his family collected tokens from boxes of washing powder @entity60 and sent off for free toy soldiers			1
he soon began making models and eventually expanded his passion until he owned everything from webbing and ammunition to flags and badges			2
he said : ' i started collecting when i was ten when my family would collect tokens from @entity60 ( washing powder of the day ) boxes and send off for free toy soldiers			1
his £ 70,000 hoard , which started with free toys from washing powder , includes 600 model aircraft hanging from the ceiling , pictured left , 700 model military vehicles , 40 real and de-activated guns , grenades , webbing , ammunition , flags , badges hours of battlefield film footage and life - sized mannequins , pictured right ' then i started making models and i have always been fascinated by the second world war			1
once you get through the @entity89 and @entity90 models you have to start looking abroad for new stuff , i got a lot from @entity93			0
' now , at the couple 's semi-detached house , model aircraft hangs from every ceiling in the house , while walls are papered in wartime propaganda posters , pictures and newspaper cuttings			0
mr @entity15 also has hours and hours of battlefield footage			1
he said : ' i admit it 's is getting a bit full now			2
i do n't want to glorify war and all that went with it but its history and its my hobby			0
what i would like to do now is to get together with some like - minded people and create a museum in @entity28			1
mr @entity15 married his wife @entity22 last year wearing full 1940s gear , complete with a cheering crowd and a guard of honour ' if a group of us with similar interests could find each other we could perhaps apply for lottery funding and put all the stuff under one roof where people could go and see it			1
i think a lot of people would find it fascinating			0
' mr @entity15 , a butcher , put a note in the paper shop window near his work asking for @entity11 memorabilia for the museum			1
he said people now bring in items all the time			2
he added that the recent upsurge in interest in both of the world wars means a surge in the price of memorabilia , raising the estimate of his collection to around £ 70,000 - although he said he would never sell it			1
mr @entity15 said he was unable to give exact amounts for the different categories of his collection because he had ' lots and lots of everything '			1
he said he has hundreds of posters , cuttings and pictures , as well as 13 mannequins in full uniform , including two @entity35 paratroopers of the @entity160 , a @entity9 engineer , a @entity162 , a @entity164 paratrooper and an ss uniform			2
he also seven @entity164 soldiers uniforms waiting to go on display			2
mr @entity15 said the @entity164 machine guns in his collection would be some of the priciest items at a cost of around £ 1,400 each			1
at his semi-detached house , model aircraft hangs from every ceiling in the house while the walls are papered in wartime propaganda posters , pictures and newspaper cuttings mr @entity15 believes his vast collection would be worth up to £ 70,000 but says he has no intention of ever selling his memorabilia but there are still some things which he has not managed to collect , including a blank - firing @entity164 machine gun he added that the @entity93 machine guns are are also expensive but many of his items are increasing in value as they get rarer			1
from the allied side , he has @entity9 @entity191 rifles and @entity193 guns			2
he has collected a @entity35 ' @entity197 ' , @entity196 machine guns and carbines			2
he also has @entity93 small arms in the collection			0
from the @entity164 side he has rifles , @entity203 machine guns and heavy machine guns			0
the war buff , whose father was an @entity48 pilot , and his friends are also involved in the re-enactment of famous @entity11 battles			0
mr @entity15 is also enrolled in the 82nd @entity35 @entity212 division			1
he said : ' we go all over the place and have a great time recreating the battles			0
we love it and the crowds love it - and everyone knows who 's going to win			0
we have @entity222 uniforms and we dress in those at appropriate meetings but not everywhere allows them			0
' in @entity164 they are not allowed to do any re-enactment of the war and @entity164 people who are into it come over here to do it			0
' one time we went to a re-enactment day in @entity233 in @entity222 uniforms and someone came quietly up to us and told us we would not be allowed in wearing them			0
we did n't know that but we knew that some places dont allow them			0
' despite his huge collections , there are still some items that the fanatic has not managed to source			0
he said : ' a blank - firing @entity164 machine gun is something that everyone wants , they are so beautifully made and you should hear the sound of one			0
' i would love a @entity255 but they cost a fortune			0
one bloke who is in to re-enactment group has bought one and he 's restoring it but i do n't think i 'll ever be able to have one of those			0
hopefully with a museum we can look at bigger items because i just do n't have the room			1
