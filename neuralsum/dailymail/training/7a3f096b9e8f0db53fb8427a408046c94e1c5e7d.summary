supermarkets were facing a backlash last night after claiming it was ' unnecessary ' to spell out on labels whether meat comes from animals killed by religious slaughter @entity34 mps have tabled an amendment to the @entity36 , which is to be debated next week , that would require a move to clearer labels			1
however , the idea is opposed by most retailers and @entity41 , the prime minister , believes that there is no need to change the law			1
demands for more informative labels follow widespread outrage over the disclosure in yesterday ’s @entity49 that millions of people are being sold halal and kosher meat without being told			2
all the major supermarkets are selling @entity55 lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels			2
separately , many restaurants such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 are selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus			1
both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut			1
but some animals are not stunned beforehand , leaving them in pain			0
the @entity34 mp @entity74 , who is leading calls for a new labelling law , said : ‘ there is overwhelming public support for this change			2
people should be able to make an informed choice about what they are buying			0
’ mr @entity74 has the support of a large number of @entity85 , while the @entity86 leader , @entity86 , said that consumers should be given more information			0
@entity89 has confirmed it stocks some branded halal and kosher meat however , mr @entity41 last night ruled out the need for a new national labelling system , insisting that it was up to the food industry to act if consumers demanded more transparency			1
‘ i would hope it will be dealt with by restaurants and businesses , ’ he told @entity98			0

@entity110 , the food director at the @entity105 , said : ‘ we have not seen evidence that this is what people want to see			0
labels are very tight in terms of the space and what we can put on them			0
this has to be driven by evidence to show that people want to see it alongside the things that are already on it like durability , country of origin and price			0
’ by contrast , @entity128 , @entity129 and the co-op broke ranks to say that it is time for the government to take a lead to develop clear and consistent guidance for the food industry			0
the desire for improved labels is supported by groups from all religious faiths			0
