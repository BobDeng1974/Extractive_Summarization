published : 13:24 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 15:35 est , 23 january 2014 in 1820 , a landslide on @entity3 ’s @entity2 sent a 4m wave into nearby @entity5 , destroying homes and drowning many of the local people			1
now one designer has created a concept house that allows water to flow through it , in an attempt to protect existing residents from the same fate			0
the 3,140 square - foot house is located on the northern end of the island and is the work of architect @entity20 of @entity21			0
located on @entity2 in @entity3 , the @entity22 was built by @entity21 the @entity22 is 9m ( 30 ft ) tall			1
its two floors are situated 2.7m ( 9ft ) high			0
these floors are supported by a steel frame and strategically placed pillars			2
the gaps between the columns are filled in with clear glass doors that slide shut			0
they are designed to break with ease under the force of flooding			0
the ground floor , known as the ‘ flood room ’ , feels like an ordinary room rather than a redundant space			1
it 's decorated like any other living space , expect every item within it is certified waterproof so they wo n't be ruined by floodwater			0
dubbed the ‘ @entity22 ’ , it stands at around 9m ( 30 ft ) tall and can withstand the impact of waves with heights of up 2.4m ( 8ft ) as well as a 7.8 scale earthquake and 85 mph lateral winds			1
this is because the home ’s two main floors are situated 2.7m ( 9ft ) above ground			1
they are supported by a steel frame and strategically placed pillars , according to a report by @entity60 in @entity61			0
the gaps between the columns are filled in with clear glass doors that slide shut and are designed to break with ease under the force of flooding			1
this would allow the water to flow through the bottom chamber and out the opposite side dispersing the force and reducing pressure on the columns			1
the ground floor , known as the ' flood room ' , feels like an ordinary room , rather than a redundant space the ground floor is decorated a lot like any other living space , expect every item within it is certified waterproof so they wo n't be ruined by floodwater the house stands at around 9m ( 30 ft ) tall and can withstand the impact of waves with heights of up 2.4m ( 8ft ) the ground floor , known as the ‘ flood room ’ , feels like an ordinary room rather than a redundant space			2

‘ if the building was a solid wall instead of columns filled in with glass doors , the whole thing could collapse under the momentum of the wave , ’ mr @entity20 told @entity61			2
‘ we opted to enable the building to stay intact by letting the water move through along a path of least resistance			0
’ western @entity3 lies over the 680 - mile @entity108 subduction zone , which is one of the largest active faults in @entity111			2
the home 's two main floors are situated 2.7m ( 9ft ) above ground			2
the entire structure is supported by a steel frame and strategically placed pillars @entity3 , where the house is located , lies over the 680 - mile @entity108 subduction zone , which is one of the largest active faults in @entity111 the gaps between the columns are filled in with clear glass doors that slide shut and are designed to break with ease under the force of flooding ' we opted to enable the building to stay intact by letting the water move through along a path of least resistance , ' said designer @entity20			1

the *unusual* ‘ @entity22 ’ is located in @entity3 ’s @entity2
two floors are placed 2.7m above ground and supported by steel structure
during a flood , glass *panels* break to let water flow through lower levels
this disperses the force and reduces pressure on the supporting columns
