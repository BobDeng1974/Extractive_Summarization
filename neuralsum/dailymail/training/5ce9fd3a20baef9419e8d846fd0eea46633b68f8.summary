@entity1 's co-chairman @entity0 is hoping @entity2 beat @entity3 in their @entity5 replay to set up a fifth - round tie at @entity7			1
@entity2 , famous giant - killers themselves from when they beat @entity9 in the 1973 final , were held by @entity10 side @entity3 in a goalless draw at the @entity12 on saturday and the two sides will meet again next week			1
@entity0 , co-chairman @entity14 and @entity1 manager @entity15 had all wanted to be paired with @entity16 after saturday 's stunning triumph over @entity18 at @entity19			1
@entity1 co-chairman @entity0 is hoping the club can claim another @entity22 scalp @entity1 's fourth - round win over @entity18 on saturday was one of the biggest upsets in recent history the @entity28 ' 4 - 2 win at @entity19 has made them hungry to face more @entity22 opposition but @entity0 had no complaints after @entity1 were drawn to play either @entity2 or @entity3 at home in monday night 's draw and has good reason to cheer on @entity34 's @entity2 in their replay			1
' if we ca n't get @entity16 , @entity37 or @entity38 , let 's have a home draw			0
it 's up to us now , ' @entity0 said			1
' we 're the lowest - ranked team left in it , apart from @entity43 , and the odds are stacked against us , but let 's give it our best shot			0
' if we play like we did against @entity18 we will take some stopping			2
' i would prefer @entity2 because of my mother			2
i lost her in 1993 and she was one of 13 children , so imagine how many cousins i 've got ! ' she moved down here just after the war and worked in @entity55 's			0
that 's where she met my dad			0
' @entity2 were held to a 0 - 0 draw with @entity3 in their fourth - round tie at the @entity12 the @entity12 was at less than half capacity as @entity2 and @entity3 both drew a blank @entity34 's side are on a bad run of form and have won just two of their last 14 games in all competitions @entity72 side @entity1 's 4 - 2 win at @entity18 is one of the biggest cup upsets of all time and follows just less than two years after @entity15 steered the @entity77 club on a fairytale journey to @entity79 in the @entity81 final			1
@entity15 led the @entity28 to promotion via the @entity84 play - off final later that season and although he was rewarded with a new three - year contract soon after , the club 's latest cup exploits will inevitably lead to questions over his longer - term future			1
' he 's still got 18 months left on his contract so everyone can bugger off ! ' @entity0 responded			2
' it would have to be something very special to take him from here			0
his family live in the area and i 'm sure they 're all very happy here			0
' that would end up being down to @entity15 , but of course we want to keep him			0
' @entity1 have performed well in recent cup competitions and reached the @entity81 final in 2013			0

@entity0 wants @entity1 to repeat their *heroics* from @entity19
the @entity28 upset @entity18 4 - 2 in the last round of the @entity5
@entity1 have been drawn against either @entity2 or @entity3
@entity2 and @entity3 face each other in a fourth - round replay next week
