by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 05:02 est , 28 december 2012 when three of their cats vanished without trace , the @entity1 thought they had simply run away			1
their devastated children searched the neighbourhood and stuck up posters to try to track them down			0
but when – several months later – they found another one of their pets trapped in a cage , the family realised there was a more sinister reason behind their disappearance			1
' not proud ' : @entity14 ( left ) baited a home - made trap with tuna to capture pets including @entity19 ( right ) their neighbour , @entity14 , 74 , had been baiting a home - made trap with tuna to capture the pets before releasing them into the countryside			1
the pensioner hated the animals for fouling his immaculate garden			1
only one of the pets that he captured managed to return home – and he was so disorientated by the experience that he later got run over and died			1
two of the family ’s cats remain missing , but there seems little hope that they will be found			1
@entity40 , 27 , has lived two doors away from @entity14 in @entity42 , @entity43 , all her life , and used to go to his house as a child to play with his @entity48 puppies			1
so when three of her cats went missing in as many days in april , she never suspected he was behind it			2
home - made : the trap that @entity14 used to capture the cats before releasing them into the countryside pumpkin , a three - year - old black and white tom , was the first to go			1
the same thing happened to their second tom , @entity62 , and their tortoiseshell cat @entity64 , both of whom were little more than kittens			0
distraught children @entity69 , eight , and @entity70 , five , made posters and leaflets to distribute locally , but to no avail			2
although @entity74 did return home , he was ‘ confused ’ and was run over by a car shortly afterwards – leaving the family with just one cat called @entity79			1
over the summer , mrs @entity40 and her factory worker husband , @entity80 , decided to get another cat , a ginger tom they called @entity19			0
when he did n’t return home one evening in october , mr @entity84 went to search and found him trapped in the cage at 1am			1
‘ i thought he had been hit by a car and wandered around the road looking for him , ’ he said			0
survivor : @entity19 was saved when his owner found him at 1am in a cage in a bush in @entity14 's front garden it was only when he heard a miaow that he was able to trace @entity19 to a cage in a bush in @entity14 ’s front garden			1
‘ i turned the light of my mobile phone on and saw he was sitting in this cage , ’ mr @entity84 said			2
‘ i realised it was a trap immediately			2
’ the cage was made of chicken wire and baited with tuna			1
as the cat entered , a peg holding up a plastic flap was dislodged , sealing the animal in			0
@entity14 was arrested the next day and questioned			2
he admitted responsibility and apologised to the family			0
he was later fined £ 250 for theft by @entity112 magistrates and ordered to pay £ 205 in compensation			0
‘ he said he was very sorry for what he had done and would never have done it if he had known the hurt he was causing , ’ mr @entity84 , 28 , said			0
‘ he has a really beautiful garden and the reason he gave police was he likes it pristine and did not want to put his hand in the soil and find cat poo			0
if we had known there was a problem we would have bought him some cat - repellent pellets to put down – but we did n’t know			0
‘ we still do talk to him though			0
we do n’t expect to ever see the other two cats again but if anyone knows anything we would like to know if they are all right			0
’ @entity14 said last night : ‘ it ’s not something i ’m proud of			2
