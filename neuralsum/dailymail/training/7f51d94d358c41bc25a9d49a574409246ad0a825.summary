by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 not only expensive but also notoriously difficult to clean , but a new invention may well change that			0
a team of scientists from @entity8 's @entity7 have developed an invisible coating that triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light			1
when the mineral , which is made from anatase titanium dioxide , coats the fabric , any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours			1
not only is the invention the ultimate in smart technology , but it 's also beneficial to the environment			0
' on the one hand , clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material , ' said mr @entity34			0
' and on the other hand ... we also have less consumption of energy , of water , of chemicals			0
' the coating was actually first developed in 2002 , but applying it to cashmere has proved difficult since the delicate fabric is especially prone to damage			1
two-fold : ' clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material , ' explained lead scientist @entity34			0
' and on the other hand ... we also have less consumption of energy , of water , of chemicals ' special : the notoriously expensive cashmere wool is produced from the undercoat of @entity2 goats that only live in mountainous regions of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 the notoriously expensive cashmere wool is produced from the undercoat of @entity2 goats that only live in mountainous regions of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
' it is a delicate operation because of the risk of spoiling the cashmere in the process , ' mr @entity34 told @entity75			2
' how to apply nano - sized photocatalysts to cashmere and retain its delicate characteristics was a huge challenge			2
' but now that the technology has been perfected , he expects it to be a big hit in the fashion industry .			2

a team of scientists from @entity8 have developed an invisible coating made from the mineral anatase titanium dioxide , which triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light for 24 hours
they *predict* it will soon hit the *mainstream* market , especially since it only raises the overall price of cashmere by about one per cent
