all smiles : @entity1 outside court yesterday a property developer who falsely accused his neighbour 's son - in - law of a racist assault in a row over a new driveway smirked yesterday as he walked free from court			1
@entity1 concocted a ' tissue of lies ' , claiming @entity13 had kicked him and called him a ' p * * i ' following the 18 - month boundary dispute in a genteel village in the @entity17			1
but the move backfired when police discovered that the altercation had been caught on @entity21 and cleared mr @entity13 of any wrongdoing			1

despite their objections , he carried on transforming his modest £ 300,000 four - bedroom detached home into what residents in the upmarket village describe as a ' @entity54 palace '			0

last night mr @entity13 said he was relieved the case was finally over			2
but he added : ' if i 'd been prosecuted for racially aggravated assault you can bet i would have ended up in jail , not with a suspended prison sentence			2
' i 'm married with two kids but would have lost my business and my livelihood			0
being branded racist – i could n't really have been accused of anything worse			0
' @entity63 is a bully who had to be told he could n't take the law into his own hands			0
' another neighbour said : ' everyone 's had problems with them ( the @entity87 )			0

around 18 months later , mr @entity13 , who was visiting his in - laws , tried to remove a fence panel the @entity108 claimed was sticking out on to their property			2

' judge @entity127 said the offence was particularly serious because @entity1 had claimed the ' assault ' was racially motivated			2
he told the father of two : ' society has an abhorrence of those who use racist remarks			0
