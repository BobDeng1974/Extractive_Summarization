@entity1 defender @entity0 believes unbeaten @entity4 leaders @entity2 will have to prove their mental toughness if they are to match the achievement of the @entity9 ' @entity8 ' side he was part of 10 years ago			1
@entity12 's team have a four - point cushion at the top of the table and could extend the gap further in saturday 's early kick - off at @entity18			1
the season is only 10 matches old and @entity0 said there is a long way to go before the @entity24 club can think about emulating the @entity26 ' formidable 2003 - 04 season			1
@entity0 impressed during @entity1 's defeat to @entity28 in the @entity29 @entity30 scored the winner for @entity28 as they eased into the knockout stages ' they have a good team and with the squad they have of course they can do it , ' he said			1
' but it 's not the only quality			0
every game is challenging and sometimes things do n't go well for you but you need to be able to come back and carry on fighting			0
' the season has just started			1
it 's a great chance ( for @entity1 to end the unbeaten run ) but the most important thing is we want to win the game			2
' the roles were somewhat reversed last april when @entity2 arrived at @entity18 , with @entity1 top of the table and seemingly on course for their first title since 1990			2
however , things quickly unravelled as @entity12 's tactical masterclass saw the visitors stifle their free - flowing opponents with a disciplined defensive display which centred around getting men behind the ball and hitting on the counter-attack			1
@entity65 's slip to allow @entity66 to race through and break the deadlock just before half - time has been translated into a song which far from being a @entity2 fans ' favourite is sung at grounds around the country when the former @entity75 captain is in town			1
@entity77 added a late second to spell the beginning of the end of the @entity82 ' title dream and @entity1 are looking for revenge			0
@entity2 continued their unbeaten @entity4 run against @entity85 last weekend @entity9 went a whole season unbeaten in 2003/04 and @entity2 have been tipped to follow suit what may help them this time around is the expectation @entity2 , as league leaders and with summer signings @entity91 and @entity93 in sparkling form , will not come to kill the game			1
' it is a very important game when you think what they did to us last season , ' said @entity0 , whose defensive performance in the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity28 in the @entity105 has put him in contention to start at the expense of Â£ 20million summer signing @entity109			1
' that cost us the league and now we have the chance to beat them			0
i ca n't wait for that honestly			0
' every game for @entity1 you want to win and @entity2 are playing well now			2
' when you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams			0
@entity2 attack and @entity1 attack as well			2
i think you are going to see a great game			0
' this season they will attack , with the players they have they ca n't defend ( all the time )			0
' i think they will just try to score goals and we will try to score goals			0
' most of @entity1 's big names are expected to return at the weekend but @entity139 was impressed by the performance of some fringe players in the @entity105 and suggested those who were benched should not automatically assume they will earn a recall .			0

@entity2 have started the season in *blistering* form
