click here for all the facts and stats from our brilliant @entity3 @entity5 has already said it could be three long years before the rebuilding work is complete here at @entity9 and there was little on saturday to suggest that day might come any sooner			1
never mind the challenge ahead			2
this was a long 90 minutes , a game that was settled by a second - half @entity15 goal but one that was torturous at times for the @entity19 supporters who seem every bit as anxious as their team at the moment			1
pay no attention to the statistics that boast more than 70 per cent of the possession and a ratio of shots that would have you think @entity29 had masterminded a commanding performance			0
subs : @entity15 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			1
@entity33 : @entity37 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			0
subs : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			0
referee : @entity80 they were playing a @entity33 side that will do well to remain in the @entity83 this season and they produced a laboured display even if their visitors did sit back and let them have most of the ball			2
sir @entity89 said @entity9 ’s football too often lacked pace and ambition when @entity93 was in charge last season and to their all - conquering former manager this would have been no easier on the eye			1
the fact @entity100 and @entity48 were both hooked by @entity29 said it all			0
@entity89 always employed pace and width to punish opponents but @entity9 ’s wide men were woefully ineffective on this occasion , with @entity51 a poor imitation of the player who so dazzled when he first arrived from @entity108			1
yes , @entity33 defended deep and in numbers			0
but still @entity51 should be better than this			0
in fairness to the @entity114 international , his failure to really threaten might have had something to do with the orders @entity9 seemed to be under			1
with his own defence severely weakened by injuries and suspension and @entity47 partnering @entity45 at centre half as a result , @entity29 may well have urged a bit more caution than usual			0
both sides observe a minute 's silence in honour of the war dead before the start of play as the teams commemorate @entity131 @entity9 and @entity132 captain @entity50 takes a shot as @entity9 came out of a a frustrating afternoon with a win @entity48 looks to inject a little bit of quality into the game as he takes on @entity64 down the right hand side @entity70 had @entity33 's best chance of the game but his lob over @entity142 was also over the crossbar @entity144 miles man united 112.0 69.6 @entity49 90 11.4 7.1 @entity44 90 11.1 6.9 @entity50 90 11.0 6.8 @entity33 108.5 67.4 @entity66 90 11.3 7.0 @entity67 90 11.3 7.0 @entity64 90 10.2 6.4 the fact @entity50 was deployed in midfield alongside @entity49 — with @entity44 planted between them and the back four — rendered @entity149 an isolated figure in attack and made @entity9 a less potent force as a result			1
it may not have helped , either , that this was the third formation @entity29 has employed in 12 games			0
the manager admitted afterwards that his side needed ‘ more speed ’ , even if he was entitled to be satisfied with a first clean sheet in six games as well as three points that ‘ keep them in the race for the places they want ’			2
but they were fortunate not to concede when a mistake by @entity47 and @entity45 was almost punished by @entity70 and not until @entity15 arrived from the bench did the 67th - minute breakthrough come			1
as @entity171 remarked in his post-match press conference , rarely has he had a better opportunity to beat @entity9 at home			1
the selection of @entity176 at centre half did make sense when the versatile @entity179 is a naturally defensive player and @entity44 was always going to be more comfortable in midfield when this , remember , was his first start of the season			0
@entity9 did look fairly composed to begin with			1
they enjoyed more than 80 per cent of the possession in the opening 10 minutes and after little more than 20 minutes — according to the statisticians — had completed 174 passes to @entity33 ’s 34			0
they had also threatened with a decent effort from @entity48			0
@entity46 prevents @entity65 breaking away for @entity33 as @entity9 dominated possession but struggled to create chances @entity50 takes a shot but the @entity33 defence were prepared to put their bodies on the line in a dogged first half defensive display @entity44 , starting his first game this season , is tackled by @entity69 as @entity171 's side proved a frustrating obstacle @entity205 defender @entity204 , who was impressive in a makeshift @entity9 defence , works to keep @entity68 away from goal but @entity9 were also proving a tad impatient , unleashing a series of shots from distance when a more confident attacking team might have tried to get more into the @entity33 penalty area			1
@entity9 were trying to attack from all areas			1
@entity46 set off from inside @entity9 ’s half and forced a fine save from @entity37 , and @entity47 also pressed forward only to then concede possession cheaply			2
such was the speed with which @entity33 then broke on the counter-attack @entity50 had to cover for his team - mate at centre half			0
@entity221 wins the ball ahead of @entity48 as @entity33 showed determination to frustrate @entity5 's side for more than an hour @entity100 was finding life tough on a difficult afternoon before @entity15 's strike put @entity9 into the lead @entity51 was a shadow of the player he was when he arrived in @entity132 - see his pitch map and more in @entity231 @entity171 bellows instructions to his team , who showed plenty of passion and organisation to keep @entity9 at bay for so long @entity51 tries a volley but his way is blocked by a wall of @entity33 defenders lined up inside their own penalty area a moment ’s misjudgement from @entity176 and @entity45 was almost extremely costly , their failure to intercept a long ball forward suddenly invited @entity70 to strike			1
as it was the former @entity9 player ’s lob over @entity142 floated the wrong side of the crossbar when he really should have scored			1
with the arrival of the half - time whistle came the sense that 45 minutes of domination had been squandered too			0
only once had @entity37 really been called upon to make a save , and that must have concerned @entity29			0
a second save for @entity37 would come shortly after the break , with @entity52 testing the @entity33 goalkeeper			0
but still @entity9 needed more urgency ; still they needed to attack with more purpose			2
@entity50 threatened with a curling shot that flew narrowly wide but a better chance would come in the 57th minute when @entity49 , having secured the corner in the first place , saw his thumping header cleared off the line by @entity66			2
after little more than an hour @entity29 decided it was time to make a change			2
off came @entity48 and on went @entity15			2
the @entity275 midfielder had only been on the pitch for four minutes when he put @entity29 's side into the lead @entity15 is mobbed by @entity149 and @entity50 as @entity19 experienced a tide of relief with the goal 23 minutes from time it was a decision that reflected well on @entity29 , @entity15 exchanging passes with @entity51 before unleashing a shot that took a deflection off the head of @entity221 and beat @entity37 despite the @entity33 goalkeeper getting a hand to the ball			1
perhaps @entity37 should have done better			0
@entity15 almost struck again when another deflected effort bounced off a post , with @entity52 then failing to convert from the rebound			1
in the end it mattered not			0
in the end @entity9 were rewarded for their dominance with the victory that keeps them just two points off the @entity302 places			2
and right now @entity29 will take that , even if the task of guiding this club back to the summit of the @entity308 game remains a massive one			0
@entity49 shows @entity66 away from goal as @entity9 worked hard to snuff out any hopes of a @entity33 comeback @entity68 tries to escape from @entity43 , who was back on the right side of defence again as @entity9 coped with injuries @entity47 finished the game in a centre back partnership with @entity44 , as the two midfielders had to slot into defence			1

@entity15 comes off the bench to score for @entity9 in the 67th minute
@entity15 hits the post late on , but @entity9 fail to impress in *scrappy* win
@entity171 's side had frustrated their hosts for over an hour
