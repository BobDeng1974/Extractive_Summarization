by @entity0 crumbling into the ground , this is the hauntingly beautiful relic of a church left abandoned for 30 years after miraculously surviving one of the world 's most devastating natural disasters			1
it was hit by the tragic @entity9 earthquake of 1980 , which killed 3,000 , severely injured a further 10,000 , and left 300,000 homeless in the tiny village of @entity12 , southern @entity13			1
survivors fled to the countryside five miles away , rebuilt the town there , and never returned			2
crumbling : this is the shell of a chapel that incredibly survived the @entity9 earthquake of 1980 in @entity12 , south @entity13 , that killed 3,000 and injured 10,000 discoloured : the walls which were once painted vibrant blue , red and gold have become marred by dust over the years after villagers fled but incredibly , the once - grandiose chapel remains as a lasting , haunting reminder of the past			1
large swathes of the roof have collapsed , leaving wicker and wood panels where there was once elaborately carved white stone			0
the vibrant blues and opulent golds that once coated the walls have been marred by dust			0
swamped with lumps of brick and splintered doors , one chamber is almost impossible to walk through			0
and the altar is a shell of the stone monument it once was			0
destroyed : the once opulent white stone ceilings have given way , exposing the wicker foundations and wooden eaves , leaving the ground swamped in debris stuck in time : these prayer stands may be smashed and coated in a film of cobwebs , but they still offer a glimpse into the history of the village 's @entity60 heritage capturing the eerie structure , photographer @entity63 and artist @entity64 aim to shed light on churches across southern @entity13 that have been inexplicably abandoned			1
it is part of a series titled @entity69 , or ' good fortune ' , which the pair will use to petition for the derelict monuments to be reopened to the public			1
they said : ' most churches and chapels were bricked up , waiting for a more than unlikely reconstruction			0
' unfortunately bricks did n’t keep looters away and most of the relics have been stolen			2
' given the great importance and value that these religious symbols have in southern @entity13 , most figures , santos , madonnas , and paintings have disappeared , leaving behind a significant cultural void hard to replace			2
@entity92 : the altar has been stripped to its bare brick foundations - a dramatic transformation from the opulent style of decorative @entity13 churches looted : furniture and any remaining items are strewn about the chapel , which has been raided by looters over the past three decades			1
photographer @entity63 and artist @entity102 want to shed light on the abandoned monument and a number of others across earthquake - hit southern @entity13 to preserve what is left ' as artists , we are on a permanent quest for this kind of situations , where our work can contribute in changing the way we perceive these places			1
' they added : ' at this moment though our interest goes beyond these photographs			0
' we are working in the first intervention that will reopen one of these churches to the public for the first time in 35 years			0
' to do so , we are working with public and private institutions , plus we have created a limited edition of prints in order to finance the production of new artworks for these churches , that will replace the originals that have been stolen			0
