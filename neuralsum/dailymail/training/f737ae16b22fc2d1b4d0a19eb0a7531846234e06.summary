@entity1 's return to full fitness looked to have suffered a setback on thursday when he stayed down following an @entity5 tackle during a @entity7 training session			1
the @entity9 striker has only started 73 games in three years at @entity7 , after suffering injuries in every season he has been at the club			0
he appeared to be getting back to full fitness with two goals in the first two games of this campaign , so boss @entity17 will be hoping the knock turns out be nothing serious			0
crunch : @entity1 is taken out by @entity5 in @entity7 's training session on thursday staying down : @entity1 lay on the ground following the tackle by @entity25 left - back @entity5 concern : @entity5 and @entity27 look down at their stricken team - mate after the tackle it took the forward just 23 seconds to score against @entity33 on monday after coming on as a substitute , in a game in which understudy @entity36 scored twice			2
the form of @entity36 and @entity38 would soften the blow of an injury to @entity1 , but it would still be frustrating after the niggles the @entity9 has had with since joining in 2011			0
@entity42 also took part in thursday 's training session , and he 'll be hoping to feature on saturday when the @entity46 champions take on @entity47 at the @entity48			2
that 's the way to do it : @entity42 takes a shot while his new @entity7 team mates watch on in thursday 's session a little help ? @entity5 looks away before tending to @entity1 , who has scored in both of @entity7 's games this season coming to get you : @entity5 goes charging after the ball in the incident that hurt @entity7 's star striker main man : @entity1 came off the bench and scored within 23 seconds against @entity33 on monday practice makes perfect : @entity1 displayed the almost identical technique when he scored against @entity33 @entity64 deserved this performance - @entity17			1
