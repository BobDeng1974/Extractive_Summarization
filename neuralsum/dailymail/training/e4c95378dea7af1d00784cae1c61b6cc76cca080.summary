@entity1 - based designers have created a concept 3d printer that combines facial recognition with a hot plate and layers of batter forget selfies burnt into toast and marshmallows printed with your portrait , the next trend will be to have your face immortalised on a pancake			1
a research and design team has created a concept 3d printer that combines facial recognition with a hot plate and layers of batter to create complex images			1
and the printing has the capability to be perfectly timed using algorithms so the lighter and darker tones of the face are captured , and cooked , with precision			2
the idea was developed by research and innovation experts at @entity1 - based @entity34			1
it uses @entity38 ( @entity37 ) technology to convert online designs into numbers , similar to coordinates on a graph			1
this is combined with embedded face recognition and tracking software to ' print ' layers of batter directly onto a hot plate			1
in particular , the concept technology uses a digital camera combined with image processing libraries to perform face tracking and extraction			1
@entity34 has developed bespoke software that is capable of turning this into contours for the batter dispenser			2
the darkest areas would be deposited first , through four distinct shades to the lightest areas			0
once applied to the hot plate , the batter would start to cook and change colour meaning that as subsequent layers were laid down , the printer would add different tones to the image			1
the firm said : ' achieving the perfect result is a delicate balance between batter viscosity , speed of application and maintaining the correct temperature on the plate			2
and prototyping director @entity77 added : ' the real challenge was to create a program that enables the picture to be completed from start to finish within the exact timescale for the overall pancake to cook			0
' too little time and the darker tones would n’t be achieved , too long and the pancake would burn			0
' the concept uses @entity38 ( @entity37 ) technology to convert online designs into numbers , similar to coordinates on a graph			1
dubbed ' interactive eating experience ' , the machine is currently a tongue - in - cheek concept but the firm told @entity97 the technology ( mock - up example illustrated ) is possible dubbed ' interactive eating experience ' , the technology is currently a tongue - in - cheek concept but the firm told @entity97 the machine is possible			1
' all of the 3d printing of food will be possible soon ; we are just dipping our toes in the water in relation to the capabilities , ' explained @entity111 from @entity34			0
' we can create the software , we could create final product eventually , but at this moment we are very much at the conceptual stages			2
' our next field of interest is how we can take chocolate and sugar and work with them as they are potentially a more interesting candidate to work with as they could yield greater structural qualities			0
' why stop at the pancake and faces , we could one day print chocolate forms of whole heads ? ' @entity128 , from @entity129 , @entity130 , recently built a @entity132 pancake printer using @entity133 called @entity134			0
the father - of - two wrote on an indiegogo page that his unique invention was inspired by his daughters , and he built the contraption to help inspire children to become interested in engineering			2
the original idea came in 2010 after mr @entity128 read about a @entity144 designer who created a pancake stamping machine also made out of the plastic bricks			0
videos posted to @entity148 show the machine ‘ printing ’ words and designs such as hearts and galloping horses onto a griddle below			0

videos posted to @entity148 show the machine ‘ printing ’ words and designs such as hearts and galloping horses onto a griddle below ( grab pictured )			0

the idea was developed at research and innovation firm @entity164
it uses @entity38 ( @entity37 ) technology to convert online designs into numbers , similar to coordinates on a graph
this is combined with embedded face recognition and tracking software
layers of batter would then be ' printed ' in stages onto a hot plate
dubbed ' interactive eating experience ' , the idea is currently a tongue - in - cheek concept but the firm told @entity97 the technology is possible
