perched on a hotel sofa barely inches from @entity1 , i am trying , as covertly as possible , to scrutinise her rather lovely face			1
all peachy skin and thick , glossy locks , she also looks trim and toned in skinny jeans			2
it ’s difficult to believe that in the next few months , the actress – remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of @entity12 ’s 1980s detective duo @entity13 – will be collecting her bus pass			1
from where i ’m sitting , she looks barely a day over 40			1
it is impossible , frankly , not to wonder whether @entity16 has been given a , shall we say , little helping hand			2
there is no ‘ pillow face ’ here or unnaturally shaped eyebrows ( a telltale sign )			2
‘ i am a bit surgery - phobic – i am a total coward , ’ she insists			2
‘ i do n’t judge anyone for doing it – people have to do what ’s right for them			1
but for me a healthy lifestyle is the key			2
’ it ’s hard to argue with that sentiment			1
and this , indeed , is why we are meeting			2
for the past two years , under the tutelage of nutritional therapist @entity45 , @entity1 has changed what and how she eats – and in the process , she says , transformed her health and her figure			1
she tore up her rulebook too : out went breakfast – instead she has just two large meals a day			1
out , too , went wholegrains and she even stopped sipping water in the day , something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger			1
so convinced is she that what @entity45 taught her is the key to long - lasting health and wellbeing that she has co-written a book with her , @entity58 , in which she shares their discoveries , backed up , she says , by credible new research			1
‘ i had no idea that when i met @entity45 i would drop a stone in weight and a dress size , gain lean muscle , and have vastly improved energy levels , all while turning upside down the things i previously believed in , ’ @entity1 says			1
‘ but that ’s what has happened and it ’s why i wanted to share it with a wider audience			1
’ the actress ( pictured with co-star @entity79 ) is remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of @entity12 ’s 1980s detective duo @entity13 ironically , @entity1 once thought herself the last person to need a lifestyle reboot			1
always fit , she went organic in her late 20s at a time when it was barely heard of			1
‘ this was the 1980s so everyone thought i was mad , although it made complete sense to me , ’ she recalls			2
‘ my view was it was silly to put chemicals in your body that do n’t need to be there , but that was forward - thinking at the time			0
it was me , prince @entity92 and some hippies			0
but i stuck to it			0
’ @entity1 , married to her @entity13 co-star @entity79 , has enjoyed a busy career in theatre and tv , but two years ago started to develop unexplained joint pain and was advised by her osteopath to see @entity45			1
‘ i was actually pretty resistant at first as i thought the one thing i know is how to eat properly , ’ she explains			0
‘ one by one she busted a lot of the myths that were a cornerstone of my diet			0
’ first to face scrutiny was @entity1 ’s fondness for wholegrains			1
‘ i was surprised as i knew about processed grains but i thought wholewheat was fine , until @entity45 explained that it creates inflammation in the gut			0
she told me to cut them out			0
’ aging well : @entity1 , pictured left in her 30s , will be celebrate turning 60 soon , but she looks barely a day over 40 it meant a gluten - free diet – not easy for a self - confessed ‘ breadaholic ’			1
pasta was also jettisoned , replaced by protein and vegetables			0
‘ at first i thought , “ i ca n’t do this , ” ’ she explains			0
‘ but now i do n’t miss them at all			0
i eat salmon , eggs , nuts , organic turkey and salads			0
’ and it was not just what she ate but when that @entity45 also changed			2
@entity1 ate little and often in the belief it kept her blood sugar levels regulated			1
but @entity45 told her that cutting out breakfast altogether and eating two large meals a day was a better way of regulating her metabolism			1
this is backed up by new research into intermittent fasting , which shows that better weight control can be achieved with long periods without eating – popularised by the 5:2 diets , in which you consume very few calories for two days of the week and eat a normal , balanced diet the rest of the time			0
some studies have found the same benefits – which also include lower cholesterol and blood pressure – might be gained by daily ‘ fasts ’ achieved by eating dinner then nothing else until lunch the next day			2
then came what @entity1 drank			1
‘ i was one of those people who walked around clutching a water bottle and sipping at it throughout the day , ’ she says			1
‘ but new research shows that drinking little and often actually does n’t help the cells replenish properly			0
it ’s far better to drink a large glass of water when you ’re thirsty			1
’ @entity1 tore up her rulebook too : out went breakfast and she even stopped sipping water in the day , something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger initially cynical , @entity1 says she was amazed by how easy it was to adapt			1
‘ what i was trying to overturn were the habits of a lifetime and i thought it would be incredibly hard , but it honestly took a matter of weeks			0
it ’s not set in stone either			2
if i want the odd blowout , or i really fancy breakfast , then i have it			0
’ aided by her regular cardio and hot yoga sessions , she believes she is in better shape than she was 20 years ago			0
‘ i have always been fit but i used to get incredibly tired			0
now i am bursting with energy			0
’ and , @entity1 insists , she is less likely to scrutinise herself			1
‘ i actually feel less vain now than i did in my youth			0
i ’m very comfortable in my skin and i ’m really not hung up on age at all			0
you ca n’t do anything about your chronological age , but how you age is up to you			0
’ the @entity199 , by @entity1 and @entity45 , is published by @entity200 on friday			1
the actress follows a gluten - free diet , with food like pasta jettisoned , replaced by protein and vegetables why hydration is key by @entity209 , health editor we should all drink at least two litres of water a day – about eight glasses			1
if we do , we ’ll be slimmer , have better skin , fewer health problems and the like			2
right ? well , no , actually			0
the whole two - litres - a - day idea is based on no real scientific evidence			2
in fact , one of the only studies to suggest its benefits was sponsored by , you ’ve guessed it , a mineral water firm			2
dehydration can be fatal , and in the case of the elderly , sick children or those with other health problems , a watchful eye should be kept on water intake			1
but in normal , healthy adults , the body is well adapted to make sure this does n’t happen			0
if you drink too little , you get thirsty , and go to the loo less			0
if you drink a lot , you generally pee it all out			0
and in fact , the best way to make sure is to check the colour of your urine			0
ideally , it should be a shade of pale straw and no darker .			0
