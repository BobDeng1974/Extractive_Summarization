if someone cancels an order and some become available , however , then it 's possible that we could be doing transatlantic in about three years			1
' the carrier plans to launch the global flights under a separate brand , but with the same low prices and basic service of its @entity49 flights			1
there would however , be a business class section with more leg room			0
vertical ' seating ' - in july 2010 , @entity1 introduced plans to charge passengers £ 4 ( about $ 6 ) for standing - room - only seats			1

speaking to @entity97 , mr @entity25 confirmed last month that @entity1 was planning to ' tone down ' the decor on board flights - taking away the yellow colour and adding in more blue			1
at the front of the planes , the airline is planning pictures of destinations , smiling customers and happy staff			1
he explained : ' we ’re looking at the permanent kind of overlay decals which go in the aircraft , we ’re looking at a refresh of the interiors which would take away the quite strong yellow and present different images - some of our customers , some of our staff or destinations			2
' he confirmed the airline would be ' showing happy customers and attractive destinations ' to make the aircraft feel ' a little bit fresher on the inside '			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 and head of marketing @entity25 ( right ) revealed changes for the airline video courtesy of @entity131			2
