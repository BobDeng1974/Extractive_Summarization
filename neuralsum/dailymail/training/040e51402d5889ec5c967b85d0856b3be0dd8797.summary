by @entity0 for @entity1 at the age of seven , @entity2 weighs the same as a fully grown adult and is three times heavier than he was two years ago			1
but @entity2 , who tips the scales at nearly 70kg , does n't gorge on junk food or have an adversion to exercise			2
in fact , he would love to run around after his friends - that would mean living a normal life			2
the little boy suffers from @entity17 with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , one of 75 people in the world to suffer from the potentially deadly but rare condition			1
weighing a healthy 25kg just two years ago , @entity2 is now almost 70kg and stops breathing without warning - meaning he has to have a tracheotomy tube in his throat and sleeps with a ventilator every night			1
@entity2 at his fifth birthday ( left ) before he became ill and in april this year after he put on 45kg ( right ) @entity2 is too exhausted to play with his toys anymore as he spends a lot of time in hospital in happier days when he was an energetic lively boy with his brother @entity35 ( left ) unable to understand why he ca n't play anymore , @entity2 , the only @entity21 sufferer in @entity37 , needs medication to stay awake during the day and to fall asleep at night , is now also suffering from depression as the disease has robbed him of his childhood after spending two traumatic years in and out of hospital			1
the boy from @entity44 in western @entity45 is on medication for his hormones and thyroid which are not producing enough for him to function properly			1
the condition , which is potentially lethal and incurable , affects the ability to breath and also impacts on the body 's temperature , heart rate and blood pressure - therefore @entity2 's oxygen levels can run dangerously low			1
@entity2 had to have a tracheotomy inserted in december after he almost lost his life			2
@entity2 ( left ) now has a tracheotomy tube inserted in his throat pictured with his mum , @entity62 , and @entity35 @entity2 's love of playing soccer , swimming and playing with his toys are merely memories now @entity2 ( centre ) , with @entity35 ( left ) and his dad @entity68 , needs medication to stay awake during the day and to fall asleep at night his mother @entity70 , who has another son @entity71 , 9 , and daughter @entity72 , 20 months , said the most heartbreaking part was her son not being able to understand what has happened to him			2
' he says to me " why me mummy ? what did i do to deserve this ? " , ' ms @entity70 told @entity1			0
he has also become very self - conscious of the way he looks			2
' he does n't like having photos taken - when he brushes his teeth he closes his eyes so he does n't have to see himself , ' she said			0
@entity2 's love of playing soccer , swimming and playing with his toys are merely memories now			2
' he used to love playing with his cars and trains but he asked him to put his toys away because he 's too tired - he just ca n't do it , ' his mother said			0
ms @entity70 describes the family 's journey as a ' roller coaster ' and a ' nightmare '			0
' some days we just scream and cry and say " why us ? "			0
' but she says her son 's determined spirit will get him through			0
' he 's very stubborn , ' she said			0
' he 's got a lot of fight in him			0
' @entity2 ( right ) with brother @entity35 ( left ) often asks his mother why he has become this way @entity2 now also suffering from depression after spending two stressful years in and out of hospital			1
however , the good news is his weight has remained stable since february thanks to a restricted diet of only taking in 1,000 calories a day			0
the only thing that brings joy to @entity2 's life is attending school at @entity115 in @entity116 in western @entity45			1
' it 's the only thing that makes him happy - it gives him a purpose in life , ' ms ms @entity70 said			0
' he gets to be a child after being in hospital so often			0
' the school has started a fundraising page for @entity2 in a quest to raise at least $ 100,000 for him to travel to @entity127 's @entity126 in @entity128 - his one and only possible hope to increase his quality of life			1
after more than a year of not being able to find out what was wrong , it was suggested by the @entity128 hospital to @entity2 's doctor , who sent the details of his condition around the world , that @entity2 may have @entity21 syndrome			1
' kids pass away from it which is quite scary but we just have to stay positive and stay on top of the disease , ' ms @entity70 said			0
' i 'm hoping and praying we can raise the money because i received an email saying the tests will cost up to $ 200,000			0
' the fundraising page is currently sitting at $ 28,000			1
