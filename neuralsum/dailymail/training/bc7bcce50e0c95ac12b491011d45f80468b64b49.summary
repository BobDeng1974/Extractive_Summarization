by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 10 october 2013 the true identity of ' @entity2 ' has finally been revealed 22 years after her abused and beaten body was found squashed into a cooler and dumped off a @entity6 highway			1
the child was named today as @entity8 , which was discovered when police tracked down the girl 's mother after receiving a tip from a woman who believed she knew the older sister of ' @entity2 '			1
the sister told investigators she remembers traveling to @entity18 with her father after leaving @entity8 with her mother and then never seeing her again			1
the mother told police she did not want to call them because her partner was abusive			1
she last saw him in 1991 when he took the children and told her to ' disappear ' before slamming a door in her face			2
one of her daughters was brought back to her through a relative but @entity8 was never seen again			1
a police source told the @entity53 that the fugitive father - who is believed to be in @entity18 - is now the main suspect in the brutal slaying			0
the mother said she ' tried to find out about them , and to see them , but she says he told her to get lost ' , a police source said , and she wondered for 22 years what happened to her child			1
police have obtained the birth certificate that identified @entity8 , although other information , such as the date and place of birth , were not revealed			1
she is believed to have been between the age of three and five when she died			0
she was found tied with rope and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of @entity73 off the @entity35			1
tests revealed she had been sexually abused			1
hopeful : locals examine a poster put up by police in july 2013 in the area where @entity80 was found in @entity6 outpouring : ( @entity82 ) the gravesite of @entity2 , paid for by the @entity40 's 34th precinct and ( right ) a sketch of what @entity80 may have looked like @entity40 assistant chief @entity87 , who was running the 34th @entity88 when the tragic girl was found told the @entity53 : ' as the years increased , the frustration increased with those years and the optimism declined a little bit			2
' but i never lost faith			0
i got ta admit , i never lost faith			0
the real thing is a feeling of relief			0
' police have conducted follow - up interviews and confirmed the mother 's identity using scientific evidence , a source told the @entity105			1
no names were being released as the case remains a murder investigation and no charges have been brought so far			0
in july , around the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved case , police circulated the neighborhood around @entity113 in @entity33 near the wooded area where the child was found , speaking to residents and offering a $ 12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction			1
the little girl had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia			0
she was naked except for a hair - tie with yellow plastic baubles on it			0
she had black hair and was white , possibly @entity129			0
the child was badly decomposed , making her facial features unrecognizable , and no one came forward to claim her			1
no one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few clues			2
changing neighborhood : @entity33 has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity140 , but in the ' 80s and early ' 90s , when @entity80 was killed , the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity even for hardened @entity6 cops , the case was a sad and grisly one			1
detectives named the girl ' @entity2 ' , in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her			2
two years after her discovery , @entity80 was buried in @entity155 's ceremony			0
the police of the 34th @entity157 pooled their money and paid for her gravestone			0
she was buried in a white communion dress			0
years passed , and still no one came forward			2
in 2007 , @entity80 's body was exhumed to try and extract a dna sample , but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible			0
a second attempt in 2011 , using improved technology yielded a complete dna profile , and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty - handed			2
hope : police canvass the neighborhood in @entity33 where the little girl 's body was found 22 years ago at the time of @entity80 's death in 1991 , @entity33 was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence			1
now , it has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity140 and families with young children walk the streets with impunity			2
there are a lot of new faces , but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of @entity2 .			0

@entity8 was found dead in a picnic cooler off a @entity140 *freeway* in 1991
the child had been *starved* , sexually abused and *suffocated* to death
she was never reported missing and no one came forward with any leads as to her identity
now her mother said she was *scared* of her abusive partner , who took @entity8 and never came back
