' four times you 've been given tickets for not displaying p - plates , ' the officer can be heard saying			1
the driver hit back : ' what are you trying to prove ? you want to know what i think of you			2
i think you 're just a f * * * ing useless piece of s * * t. ' ' you 're just @entity60 're just a redneck that 's bored			2
' @entity61 , president of the @entity62 of @entity63 , described the footage as ' disgusting ' and said it showed ' a lack of regard to police officers and the job they do '			1
' i think the offender needs to realise they have broken the law , ' mr @entity61 told @entity22			0
' regardless of how minor he thinks these offences are it does not warrant behaviour that is offensive and does not meet community standards			0
' if people want to drive on the road or to be part of society , they have to obey society 's rules and laws			0
' if they disagree with that , swearing or becoming aggressive is not the way to deal with the situation			0
' the video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver 's license before he tells the driver this is the fourth time he has been pulled over for the same offence the p - plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to @entity15 boasting about his brush with the law the video shows the passenger chiming in accusing the officer of being ' racist ' for pulling them over			1
' you are a racist			0
mate you done 180kms to catch me without p - plates			1
you 're putting people in danger for a p - plate , ' the driver said			2
his friend ordered the officer to hand back the license before telling his to ' wake up to yourself '			0
' you 've done your job , now we 're going			0
we 've been waiting for 15 minutes for you to give us a fine for a p - plate , ' he said			1
the officer was filmed warning the driver not to drive like that again to avoid getting another fine before asking if the pair had any questions			1
' only question i have is that you need help ... like @entity133 , ' the driver said			2
' give yourself an upper cut			0
' mr @entity61 said situations like this could have easily escalated and it was part of a ' sad trend ' where people had a lack of respect for police			0
' if a person disobeys a police direction that can set in motion a chain of events which can lead to fines , an arrest or serious injury or even officers using their appointments â€“ baton or firearm , ' mr @entity144 said			2
' it can escalate very quickly			0
' the driver called the officer a ' f * * * ing useless piece of s * * t ' but was allowed to drive away without a fine the p - plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to @entity15 and it has since been viewed more than 60,000 times ' there are proper avenues to question police directions or behaviour			1
there are oversight bodies that govern police behaviour , or you can take the matter to court			0
' it is a sad trend in society where people have a lack of respect for not only police , it occurs across the board with teachers , nurses , doctors and ambulance officers			0
' mr @entity61 said disrespectful behaviour was not confined to any age group			0
' all people from an early age can question authority , but if you disagree or are told something you dislike or are instructed to do something you do n't want to , it 's not right to become violent or aggressive , or use offensive language , it 's about having a conversation , ' he said .			2
