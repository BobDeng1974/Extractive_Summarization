by @entity1 reporter published : 10:49 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:40 est , 28 february 2014 an ‘ eccentric ’ hotelier has hit back after a scathing online reviewer who claims she ruined his romantic @entity6 weekend wrote : ‘ @entity7 is the perfect host compared to this place ’ @entity9 , who worked as a top @entity11 barrister before taking over the seafront @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , a few months ago , dismissed large chunks of the review as exaggerated or not true - but conceded that about 50 per cent of it could be accurate			1
the 55 - year - old denied she was very drunk and swearing profusely during a @entity6 's night dinner , but freely admitted she was ‘ eccentric , extroverted and loud , even when sober			1
’ ms @entity9 outside the @entity13 in @entity14 which she bought for about £ 1.5 - million from a £ 2 - million nest egg she built up as a lawyer the review left on @entity24 said : ' @entity7 is the perfect host compared to this place ' the @entity24 reviewer , only identified as @entity27 of @entity28 , said he booked in for a @entity29 and wedding anniversary weekend			1
when they went down for dinner , a woman who had earlier been in the bar ‘ intoxicated , loud and swearing like a trooper ’ , was also in the restaurant with a man they assumed was her partner			1
‘ while waiting for our meal the very drunk lady staggered over and tried to communicate to us that the lighting was too dark and should be brighter , she turned a lamp on , almost falling into my wife ’s lap and in the process knocking a picture off the wall			2
‘ so while we were eating our meal , which was really good , we were “ entertained ” by our fellow diner dropping things on the floor , shouting at her partner and generally becoming annoying			2
the 55 - year old conceded that around 50 per cent of the review could be true ‘ after a short while she grew tired of waiting for her meal , so she went downstairs to the kitchen and promptly began a barrage of foul mouthed abuse			1
after a few minutes of very industrial language she left the building , the very embarrassed waiter / manager came in to apologise for her behaviour and said that unfortunately it was not unusual as she was the owner			2
‘ well i did n’t see that coming			2
however , she was gone from the building and we finished our lovely meal in peace			0
’ the reviewer continued that they were kept awake by loud music from the bar during the night , and he had to go down at 2.30am to ask for it to be turned off			1
during breakfast , the owner was in the bar ‘ looking better than i was feeling ’			1
they left for another hotel after refusing to pay for the dinner , claiming their anniversary weekend had been ruined			1
he did praise the staff saying they ‘ deserved a medal			0
’ shown the review , ms @entity9 , responded she had ‘ no specific recollection ’ of everything said to have occurred , but pointed out that her ‘ partner ’ was in fact her 24 year - old son , on a visit from @entity96 where he lives			1
‘ of course i had a few drinks - i was excited to see him and we had a great time			0
i can be a bit raucous , but i was not drunk			0
the owner of the @entity105 said the review could have been left by a disgruntled member of staff ‘ i did have strong words with the kitchen because we were waiting too long for our dinner , and i told them in no uncertain terms that it was not good enough			1
‘ i do know that some former staff who left have been spreading all sorts of nasty rumours about me and the hotel , claiming that we are closing , that i ’ve had a nervous breakdown and staff are walking out			2
there is no truth in any of it			0
‘ i take is as a compliment to be compared to @entity7 - he had a great sense of humour , just like me , and it seemed a fun place to stay , ’ she quipped			2
‘ i am nicknamed the “ rottweiller with lip gloss ” in the courts , and i do like a drink and keeping my guests entertained			0
i ’m also known as “ @entity132 ” - you either love me or hate me			0
‘ this review could be the work of a disgruntled former member of staff being malicious			2
i never read these online things			0
’ she said she has lost £ 2,000 in cancelled bookings since the scathing review - which she calls " the @entity142 "			2
ms @entity9 , who spent 30 years at the top of her profession handling many high profile cases , bought the @entity13 for about £ 1.5million from a £ 2million nest egg she built up as a lawyer			1
‘ i looked at 37 hotels in @entity15 and @entity149 , because i wanted something to do in my retirement and the money was earning very little in interest			0
the 55 - year - old said people also call her @entity132 , because you either love her or hate her ‘ we have some loyal locals who pop in regularly , and they all seem to love the jolly atmosphere here			0
’ the current staff all had nothing but praise for ms @entity9 , and one said : ‘ she gave me a job when i really needed it , and she is lovely to work for			1
there is rarely a dull moment here			0
’ in january , two former members of staff had been arrested and bailed pending police investigations into alleged fraud and identity after a complaint by ms @entity9			1
ms @entity9 still works out of @entity11 's @entity173 , which lists her as a specialist in employment law who has acted in number of @entity178 cases and tribunals			1
its website describes her as the " queen of injunctions " , and says she has been described by legal directories as a " tenacious cross examiner			0
" it goes on to say : " @entity9 's style is direct and down to earth			1
clients appreciate her clear and approachable manner			0
her advice is practical and commercially aware			0
" in one of her more high - profile cases she secured an undisclosed settlement for @entity195 , a journalist who sued the @entity196 for sex and race discrimination in 2000			0
