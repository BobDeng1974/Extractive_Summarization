goggles that could help the blind see have come a step closer to reality			2
the technology is based on a technique known as ' neuromodulation ' in which electricity from a chip stimulates the nervous system to restore sight			2
the revolutionary system is being commercialised by @entity12 company @entity11 , with clinical trials scheduled for 2016			1

a surgeon first implants a small silicon chip with 150 electrodes on the retina			1
when the patient puts on the system 's dark glasses , an integrated video camera sends images to a portable computer			1
a connected ' pocket processor ' converts that recording into an infrared image , which the goggles will then beam into the eye			1
pulses activate electrodes in the implant , and the optic nerve carries images to the brain			2
retinal implants that restore some sight when in the blind are already available , but their quality is n't good enough to work in many real - world conditions			0
@entity11 's solution , however , claims it has been able to restore the sight of rats to a level equivalent to 20/250			2
this would allow the wearer to see the largest line of letters in an opticians test			0
the company claims it may be able to get its final product to restore vision to 20/120 , which would be a huge leap forward in vision quality			0
@entity62 , the company that got @entity64 approval for the first visual prosthesis two years ago , currently offers patients about 20/1300 vision			0
to use the gadget a surgeon must first implant a small silicon chip with 150 electrodes on the retina			1

pulses activate the electrodes in the implant , and the optic nerve carries the images back to the brain			2
following surgery , patients have to train their brains to interpret the new images , which are seen in variations of back , white and grey			0
a small pilot program to test the system is already underway , with promising results			0
' we do n't give them back their sight , but another way of seeing , ' @entity110 , the surgeon who implanted the system in three of @entity11 's test subjects told @entity117			1
a new trial of the system is due to begin next year by @entity120 ’s @entity119			0
the cost for the system is expected to be around 100,000 euros ( £ 72,000 or $ 111,200 ) , plus surgery			0
