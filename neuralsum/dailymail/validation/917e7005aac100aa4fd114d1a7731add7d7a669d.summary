i always used to love watching dad fight			1
' i 've started very carefully			0
for this to be happening , i 'm 37 this year , it is a really big deal			1
all the years that we 've been training , day in , day out			2
i 've always been an athlete so this to me is massive			0
it opens up a lot of doors as well , boxing wise , to go on to bigger and better things , which is another thing			0
' winning this puts me in mandatory position for a @entity67 shot at some point , which is another big deal			0

it 's kind of like a @entity55 thing going on			0
' in training dad pushes me to my max. i 'm used to dying in training and coming back			2
