finding the time to exercise when you 've got heaps of housework - and laundry - piling up can be difficult , but this piece of gym kit means you 've got no excuse not to work up a sweat			1
@entity9 designers have developed an contraption called the @entity11 that contains a washing machine drum in its front wheel			1
when ridden , the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate , churning your clothes inside like a traditional washer			2
@entity9 designers have developed a washing machine so cyclists can clean clothes while exercising ( above ) a generator inside the bike also creates electricity which can be stored for future use			1
the designers , based at @entity26 , do not say whether the bike will automatically fill and drain with water too			1
instead , the detergent and water may need to be added and then drained before more water being added for a rinse cycle			0
they say , however , that the device could be a solution for those who want both a washing machine and an exercise bike but can not find space for both			2
alternatively it could also help shave a few pounds off your electricity bill by using pedal power to do the laundry			2
by changing the front wheel of the exercise bike into a washing machine drum it will spin as the user pedals a generator attached to the pedals ( shown above ) also produces electricity which can be stored for later use the invention could also find use in remote areas where people do not have access to reliable supplies of electricity			1
students at the university are now building a prototype of the machine			0
the group submitted the design onto the website @entity66 , which allows designers to share their ideas			0
they said : ' riding a bike is a popular exercise , washing laundry is something that you might do on daily basis or at least once a week , unless you keep buying new clothes and underwear , so why not combine them into a single useful equipment / appliance ? the designers say the device is perfect for those struggling to find space for both a washing machine and an exercise bike ' @entity11 combines a stationary bicycle and washing machine , you can exercise while at the same time simultaneously washing your clothes			1
' when you ride this bike , the pedalling motion causes the drum of the washing machine to rotate , at the same time , the superfluous electricity is generated which can be used to power the display screen or stored for future use			1
' it is not the first time cycling and the weekly wash have been combined			0
in 2011 @entity103 , a design student at @entity104 , announced he had developed a similar device that washes and dries clothes using pedal power			2
his @entity109 machine could be attached to the back of a tricycle			0
riding the bike for 10 minutes would wash the clothes before the water needed to be drained and refilled before another 10 minute cycle rinsed the clothes			0
if cycling and doing your washing at the same time does not appeal , then perhaps another device that combines a treadmill with a washing machine			0
looking more like a giant hamster wheel , it features a series of wash tubs enclosed within a large rotating wheel			0
the wheel washing machine , dreamed up by @entity130 designer @entity129 , would also generate electricity that could be used to power other household appliances			1
@entity129 created the concept for the 2014 @entity135 competition			0
the wheel concept features washing balls inside the canisters , designed to save water and improve washing			2

the @entity11 *replaces* the front wheel with a washing drum
it is being developed by designers at @entity26 , @entity9
it means cyclists can save electricity by washing clothes as they exercise
