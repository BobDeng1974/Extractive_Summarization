@entity2 's far - right @entity0 has been convulsed by a family row after founder @entity4 accused his daughter of leading the party in a politically correct direction			1
the fall - out was sparked at the weekend when @entity9 made a ‘ joke ’ in which he appeared to suggest that a popular @entity2 @entity13 singer , @entity12 , should be put into an oven			2
@entity15 accused him of making a ‘ political mistake ’ , and said the incident gave her the opportunity ‘ to remind people that the @entity0 condemns any form of @entity23 in the strongest terms ’			1
@entity4 was criticised by @entity13 groups and prominent members of his own party over the weekend for the comment made in a video posted on the @entity0 's website on friday her father then hit back by attacking @entity33 , 45 , for turning the party into a more mainstream organisation since taking the reins in 2011 – a policy that led to huge success in the recent @entity40 elections , when the @entity0 took first place in @entity2 with 25 per cent of the vote			1
‘ i consider that the serious political error is made by those who align themselves with political correctness , ’ the 85 - year - old said			2
‘ they want to be like the other parties			0
’ @entity9 had said @entity12 would be part of ‘ a batch [ of critics ] we will get next time ’ – using the word fournée for batch , evoking the word four which means oven in @entity2			2
@entity9 was re-elected as an mep in the elections , but this did not stop him making a pun referring to the @entity62 gas chambers during @entity63 in a video posted on the @entity0 website , and posted on @entity66 , the 85 - year - old attacks a number of the party 's critics , including pop star @entity71			1
when asked about another - the @entity13 singer @entity12 - @entity9 said he would be part of a ' batch next time ' , while hinting at the word ' oven '			0
thousands of @entity77 were sent to @entity79 concentration camps during the war , where most were murdered			0
a spokesman for @entity82 , a leading @entity83 civil rights group , described @entity9 's pun as ' the worst kind of anti-semitic filth '			0
@entity15 ( pictured , right , in 2011 ) said her father ( left ) had made a ' political error ' but that the ' meaning given to his comments is a malicious interpretation ' he said the group would file a legal complaint against @entity9 , who already has numerous convictions for racism and anti-semitism , this week			1
@entity2 's @entity97 and for @entity98 , also said it would lodge a complaint , calling @entity9 ' an authentic anti-semite '			0
@entity9 handed over the reins of the @entity0 to his daughter , @entity15 , in 2011 , and she has pledged to soften its image			1
when asked about one of his party 's critics - the @entity13 singer @entity12 ( pictured ) - mr @entity4 said he would be part of a ' batch next time ' , while hinting at the word ' oven ' although @entity9 retains significant influence , and @entity33 remains very loyal to him , other party members attacked him today			1
@entity0 vice-president @entity112 , who lives with @entity33 , said it was ' a bad phrase ' which was also ' politically stupid and disappointing '			0
@entity115 , an @entity0 - affiliated mp , said it was time for the party founder to ' accept [ @entity9 's ] retirement '			2
@entity120 said the comment had been misinterpreted , but added that for an experienced politician like her father ' not to have foreseen how this phrase would be interpreted is a political mistake the @entity0 is [ now ] paying for			2
' earlier @entity124 had said : ' if there are people in my camp that have interpreted my comments in this way , they are nothing but imbeciles			0
' he denied being anti-jewish , saying the words he used had ' no anti-semitic connotation ' , except for ' political enemies or idiots '			0
he made it clear that the offending video had now been removed from the web			0
@entity124 , who once described the @entity62 gas chambers as a ' detail ' of history , was runner up in the @entity2 presidential elections of 2002 .			1
