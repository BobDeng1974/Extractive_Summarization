by @entity0 the @entity1 by @entity2 horse sense : @entity5 was stimulated in the saddle desperate people often do desperate things and in 2004 @entity2 did something very desperate indeed			1
in an attempt to ‘ cure ’ his six year - old son @entity5 of autism , he took him to a shaman called @entity15 in @entity16			1
as @entity2 described in his earlier book , @entity18 , the shaman spent three days drawing a strange mucus - like liquid out of @entity5 ’s head with his fingers — his parents also had to be whipped and to have their private parts anointed with ‘ sacred vodka ’			1
afterwards , @entity15 promised that @entity5 would gradually become less and less autistic until he reached the age of nine — when his autism would disappear completely			1
but there was one condition attached to all this			2
over the next three years , @entity2 and his wife , @entity31 , had to take @entity5 on other ‘ healing journeys ’ to shamen or faith healers			1
the healers could be anywhere in the world , @entity35 told them , but if they did n’t go to see them then his original magic would n’t work			1
the @entity41 is @entity2 ’s account of what happened next			1
@entity15 ’s ministrations — whatever they consisted of — seemed to have a dramatic effect on @entity5			2
he soon stopped having violent tantrums , he was no longer incontinent and he could even hold conversations — something he had never done before			0
fearful that he might start backsliding unless they took him to another healer , they went to see the @entity52 of the @entity53			0
@entity2 had previously helped the @entity52 in a land dispute with the @entity56 government and one of their healers — a man with the seemingly unpronounceable name of @entity60 — tells him that @entity5 ’s autism is the result of a curse laid on him by disgruntled government employees : ‘ they threw a bone at you which missed and hit your son instead			1
’ part of the @entity52 ’s healing process consists of throwing the bone back from where it came			0
over the next two years , @entity2 takes @entity5 to @entity76 to see an @entity77 called @entity78 and to @entity79 to see a @entity81 healer called @entity82			1
everyone they visit behaves as if curing autism is a complete doddle — ‘ i ’ve worked with some young men with autism before , ’ @entity78 tells them			1
‘ should n’t be too much trouble			0
’ just like @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity78 starts drawing ‘ slightly bloody mucus ’ out of @entity5 ’s head with his fingers			0
‘ there , ’ he says after a while			0
‘ that should do it			0
’ and all of them do seem to do a remarkable amount of good			0
@entity5 starts to swim , to do maths and to play practical jokes			0
yet it gradually become clear that there ’s also a large element of self - deception here			0
now aged 12 , @entity5 may be much improved , but he ’s not cured , nothing like it			0
it ’s also impossible to work out how much of this improvement is due to the various shamen and how much to the unstinting care and attention that @entity2 and his wife lavish on @entity5			1
indeed , they devote their lives so wholeheartedly to him — teaching him on horseback and even bouncing on a trampoline because it makes him more responsive — that it finally drives them apart			0
you get the feeling too that @entity2 is such a sucker for @entity123 theories that it ’s sent him a bit doolally			2
while he starts off the book by seeking a cure , he soon starts moving the goalposts and ends up by saying that ‘ autism is not a problem to be fixed			2
autism is a collection of gifts , a skill set , a wonderful way of being			2
’ is it really ? or is this just another sign of desperation , of someone frantically searching for the good in any situation , however bleak ? but @entity2 then goes several stages further by suggesting that autistic people might be the forerunners of new , more evolved , less egotistical human beings : ‘ do we as autistic parents have a front - row seat at the accelerated evolution of our species ? ’ he wonders			1
the answer to that , i would suggest , is a resounding no. yet despite spiralling off into battiness , there is enough here to suggest that something — be it the power of mind , ritual or maybe magic itself — can help bring an autistic child from near total darkness out into the world .			2
