from the ' amateur ' cook who was already a culinary champion to the infamous ' @entity5 ' episode , this series of @entity1 has n't been without its controversies			1
now former contestant - and last year 's finalist - @entity8 , 22 , has weighed in , calling editors of the show ' malicious ' in their handling of @entity12 , the grandmother who quit the show following accusations of sabotage			1
' it was a case of the editors being , if not malicious , then at least completely thoughtless about how something would come across , ' says @entity8			1
subjected to shocking levels of abusive comments on the social media site , she has since spoken out about being dubbed ' a filthy slag ' and declared herself horrified at the amount of misogynistic abuse she suffered			0
writing in the @entity36 newspaper shortly afterwards , she said : ' the criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious , but as the series went on i noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny			0
' so much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender - specific			0
my self - doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic , fake , attention - seeking and manipulative			0
storm : @entity48 was furious when his @entity49 went wrong and accused @entity12 of sabotage suspicious : this shot of mrs @entity12 apparently removing mr @entity53 's effort from the freezer caused a storm ' i have defended myself against accusations of being a " filthy slag " based solely on me being a woman on a tv screen			1
' a year on and its clear that , the naysayer 's efforts notwithstanding , she still has big ambitions where baking is concerned and is gearing up for the launch of her first cookbook , @entity68			2
she also remains unafraid to hit back at critics and has launched a broadside at feminists , who , she says , have no business telling other women that baking cupcakes is somehow unsisterly			2
' the people who are most enthused by it [ baking ] are the younger generation , ' she revealed in an interview published in today 's @entity82 newspaper			0
accusation : miss @entity8 was accused of flirting her way to last year 's final by social media users outspoken : she has now decried activists who say baking cupcakes is somehow incompatible with feminism ' people who were not raised on second - wave feminism , who do n't have that instinctive reaction against domestic life			1
' it 's just something you do in your kitchen , nothing to do with your femininity or lack of , or success as a feminist			0
' to love making cupcakes , for instance , does n't make you a bad feminist			2

@entity8 , 22 , says editors were ' if not malicious ' then thoughtless
@entity5 saw contestant @entity12 leave amid accusations of sabotage
@entity8 , who has endured @entity24 storms of her own , has defended @entity12
