by @entity0 with his @entity3 - style military hat and an assault rifle in his hand , @entity1 looks every inch the rightful successor to his firebrand friend , the late @entity9 boss , @entity8			1
mr @entity1 , who as the union 's assistant general secretary is one of five candidates declared so far for his late friend 's position in charge of the @entity17 workers , pulls no punches about his far - left positioning			1
his @entity22 page is filled with status updates glorifying @entity25 strikes , with one post reading : ' it 's taken me three hours to drive eight miles : mission accomplished , gridlock achieved , victory to the @entity9			1
' gun - toting militant : @entity9 assistant general secretary , @entity1 , is a contender for the union leadership strike - happy : transport chiefs fear @entity35 may face further , and worse , strikes if mr @entity1 gets his way another post exhorts his 2,000 - plus friends not to cross the picket line in last week 's @entity41 , saying : ' if you are on our side then respect our picket lines , if you are on the government 's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century @entity50 scabs and class traitors			1
' support yourself by supporting the @entity9 strike			2
do n't cross picket lines			2
' and yet another post , which he later took down , read : ' with three different strikes announced today , i think i 'll enjoy the @entity58 weekend			0
' further posts glorify striking @entity9 members , while another attacked ' @entity62 ' [ sic ] @entity63 , saying : ' @entity64 , the @entity59 is well and truly over			0
vote @entity65 and build a workers ' party			0
' and in another post , later taken down , mr @entity1 , who is from @entity69 , in east @entity35 , wrote : ' i 've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle - class prats and their mockney accents			1
' posh people really should n't deliberately drop their h 's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not			0
' mr @entity1 , left , pictured with the late @entity9 boss , @entity8 , is one of five candidates for the job declared so far do n't you mean @entity84 ? mr @entity1 's @entity22 page tells @entity59 that the party ' is well and truly over ' after the former @entity88 leader @entity87 died , mr @entity1 wrote : ' @entity89 will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it '			1
meanwhile photographs on his @entity22 page support the image of him as a hard - left politician			2
one picture shows him and mr @entity8 grinning at the camera , with mr @entity1 raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers , while another shows him smirking in front of the @entity104 , transport bosses are said to fear a strike - happy militant like mr @entity1 succeeding in his ambition to lead the @entity9 into a new era following the death of mr @entity8 in march			1
they believe if the radical unionist becomes the new general secretary of the @entity9 , it can only mean further disruption for the capital			1
' @entity115 ' : the union member 's @entity22 page shows he is a keen supporter of strikes last week 's 48 - hour tube strike , organised by the @entity9 , brought chaos to @entity35 as trains were cancelled and stations closed			1
@entity17 members were complaining about planned closures of ticket office , where fewer than three per cent of all @entity25 journeys begin			0
a second , three - day strike had been planned for this week , but was called off at the last minute yesterday after last - ditch talks with the conciliation service acas			0
@entity35 mayor @entity131 , who had damned last week 's strike as ' pointless ' , described the cancelling of the strike , which was due to take hold today , as ' a victory for commonsense and for @entity138 '			2
mr @entity1 is one of five @entity9 members to have put their names forward for the job left vacant by @entity8 , who has been described as ' moderate by @entity9 standards '			1
the others are uncompromising hardliner , @entity145 , senior acting general secretary , @entity147 , former union president @entity148 , and the @entity9 's national organising coordinator , @entity149			1
nominations close in july and the result will be announced in september			0
@entity152 , conservative party chairman said : ' the line - up of challengers for the job of @entity9 leader is alarming			2
' @entity147 , who is considered to be a ' moderate ' when compared with the rest , held commuters to ransom and did untold damage to our economy last week on flimsy grounds			0
' or imagine a world with @entity165 in charge - a man who revels in inconveniencing the @entity168 public			0
' it 's a disgrace , and it 's high time @entity63 stood up to the union bosses who sponsor several of his own mps			0
today mr @entity1 denied being a ' communist ' or anti-middle class , and played down his comment about enjoying the @entity58 weekend after strikes were announced			2
he told the @entity176 : ' i meant nothing by that - i was just looking forward to the @entity58 weekend when i go to church			0
' and referring to pictures of him wearing a @entity3 - style hat and posing by the @entity104 , he said : ' i am no communist ... i dressed up for a laugh			0
' no - one from the @entity9 was available for comment			0
the @entity9 's work : last week 's tube strike meant chaos for commuters trying to get to work in @entity35			1
