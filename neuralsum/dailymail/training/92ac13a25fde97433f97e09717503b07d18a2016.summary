a @entity1 - based hacker claims to have found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through @entity5 and inflight entertainment systems			1
@entity7 , a consultant with cyber security firm @entity9 , is scheduled to explain his method at this week 's @entity11 hacking conference in @entity13			1
if his claim is confirmed , it could prompt a serious review of aircraft security			0
exposing threats : cybersecurity researcher @entity7 says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their @entity5 and inflight entertainment systems ' these devices are wide open			1
the goal of this talk is to help change that situation , ' mr @entity7 , 32 , told @entity27			2
the researcher said he discovered the vulnerabilities by ' reverse engineering ' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware , used to operate communications equipment			2
this equipment is made by companies including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41 in theory , a hacker could use a plane 's onboard @entity5 signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment , potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications			1
this could interfere with the aircraft 's navigation and safety systems , mr @entity7 said			1
risk : in theory , study shows a hacker could use a plane 's onboard @entity5 signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment , potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communication cyber security experts believe it ’s too early to say for certain			1
mr @entity7 admits he does n’t know how practical his hack would be in the real world			1
he has only been able to create the exploit in a lab setting			0
but if his method proves successful , the hack could give would criminals access to a plane 's navigation system			2
manufacturer , @entity71 - whose aviation 700 aircraft equipment was the focus of the research - said hackers must have physical access to @entity36 's equipment for the hack to be successful			2
more will be known later this week when mr @entity7 reveals how he hacked the equipment			1
mr @entity7 said he decided to go public to encourage manufacturers to fix what he saw as risky security flaws			2
he acknowledged that his hacks have only been tested in controlled environments , such as @entity9 's @entity86 laboratory , and they might be difficult to replicate in the real world			0
mr @entity7 said he decided to go public to encourage manufacturers to fix what he saw as risky security flaws			2
representatives for @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity90 and @entity40 said they had reviewed mr @entity7 's research and confirmed some of his findings , but downplayed the risks			1
for instance , @entity36 , whose aviation 700 aircraft satellite communications equipment was the focus of @entity97 's research , said it is not possible for hackers to use @entity5 signals to interfere with critical systems that rely on satellite communications for navigation and safety			1
the hackers must have physical access to @entity36 's equipment , according to @entity36 spokesman @entity109			0
' in the aviation and maritime markets we serve , there are strict requirements restricting such access to authorised personnel , ' said mr @entity109			0
forced to re-evaluate : details are sketchy about how the hack was done			2
mr @entity7 has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of ' hardcoded ' log - in credentials details are still sketchy about how the hack was done			1
mr @entity7 , however , has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of ' hardcoded ' log - in credentials			2
these are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password			0
the problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware , then use the credentials to access sensitive systems , mr @entity7 said			1
a @entity41 spokesman declined to comment , saying information on such vulnerabilities was not public			0
@entity11 , which was founded in 1997 , has often been a venue for hackers to present breakthrough research			2
in 2009 , @entity143 and @entity144 demonstrated a method for attacking iphones with malicious text messages , prompting @entity148 to release a patch			0
in 2011 , @entity150 demonstrated methods for attacking @entity153 's insulin pumps , which helped prompt an industry review of security			0
mr @entity7 published a 25 - page research report in april that detailed what he said were multiple bugs in firmware used in satellite communications equipment , including aerospace , military , maritime transportation , energy and communications			1
the report laid out scenarios by which hackers could launch attacks , though it did not provide the level of technical details that mr @entity7 said he will disclose at @entity11			1
@entity37 spokesman @entity172 said the company had reviewed @entity97 's paper			0
' we concluded that the risk of compromise is very small , ' he said			0
fear of flying : @entity179 , a member of @entity11 's board said : ' the type of vulnerabilities he discovered are pretty scary just because they involve very basic security things that vendors should already be aware of ' @entity40 spokesman @entity186 said , ' we have determined that the risk to @entity40 subscribers is minimal , but we are taking precautionary measures to safeguard our users			1
' one vulnerability that @entity7 said he found in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of ' hardcoded ' log - in credentials			0
these are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password			0
the problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware , then use the credentials to access sensitive systems , mr @entity7 said			1
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity207 said hardcoded credentials were ' a necessary ' feature for customer service			0
the worst a hacker could do is to disable the communication link , she said			0
mr @entity7 said he will respond to the comments from manufacturers during his presentation , then take questions during an open q&a session after his talk			0
@entity179 , a member of @entity11 's review board , said mr @entity7 's paper marked the first time a researcher had identified potentially devastating vulnerabilities in satellite communications equipment			1
' i am not sure we can actually launch an attack from the passenger inflight entertainment system into the cockpit , ' he said			1
' the core point is the type of vulnerabilities he discovered are pretty scary just because they involve very basic security things that vendors should already be aware of			0
' threat : as technology advances so do threats on international security			0
mr @entity7 said he will respond to the comments from manufacturers during his presentation			0

security researcher @entity7 says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications on passenger jets through their @entity5
communications can also be hacked through inflight entertainment systems
@entity7 is scheduled to lay out the technical details of his research at this week 's @entity11 hacking conference in @entity13
