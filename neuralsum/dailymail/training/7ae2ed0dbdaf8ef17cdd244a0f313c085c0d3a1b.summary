by @entity0 last updated at 9:05 am on 7th february 2012 dr @entity1 yesterday made his most powerful intervention yet in the assisted suicide argument a new law to legalise assisted dying would be a ‘ disaster ’ , the archbishop of @entity5 declared yesterday			1
dr @entity1 said that condoning assisted suicide would undermine the sanctity of life - and he compared its effects to the legalisation of abortion a generation ago			1
the archbishop told the @entity18 ’s parliament , the @entity19 : ‘ the default position on abortion has shifted quite clearly over the past 40 years			1
‘ to see the default position shifting on the sanctity of life would be a disaster			2
’ his warning came as the @entity19 voted overwhelmingly to condemn the ‘ @entity25 on @entity26 ’ led by former labour lord chancellor @entity27 , which called last month for laws to allow doctors to help the terminally ill to kill themselves			2
its members said @entity27 ’s panel was not independent and had endangered the vulnerable and the disabled			2
yesterday dr @entity1 made his most powerful intervention into the argument over assisted suicide , which has assumed growing political importance over the past nine years			1
in that time around 150 @entity38 have travelled to die at the @entity40 clinic in @entity41			2
no relative or friend has been prosecuted for helping , despite the fact that assisting with a suicide is a crime that can attract a 14 - year prison sentence			1
dr @entity1 said : ‘ law exists so that people may be protected , especially the vulnerable			1
law exists to provide equality of protection for all			0
what we are faced with in these proposals from the @entity25 is a legal outcome in which protection is diminished not only for vulnerable individuals but also for medical professionals			0
’ the archbishop drew a connection between abortion and assisted dying which suggests he thinks that any assisted dying law would lead to very large numbers of deaths			1
abortion was legalised in 1967 with safeguards to assure doubters that it would only be permitted in a small number of cases where a pregnant woman was at risk			1
however , there are now 200,000 abortions every year and abortion ends more than one in five of all pregnancies in @entity18			2
in the past nine years around 150 @entity38 have travelled to the @entity40 clinic in @entity41 ( pictured ) to legally end their lives dr @entity1 said of the proposals from @entity27 ’s @entity25 : ‘ to change the law on this subject is to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself			1
’ he added : ‘ we are not committed to the notion - the eccentric notion - that @entity90 believe we should cling to life at all costs			0
‘ we are committed as @entity90 to the belief that every life in every imaginable situation is infinitely precious in the sight of @entity97			0
to say that there are certain conditions in which life is legally declared to be not worth living is a major shift in the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which we live			0
we can be realistic , we can be compassionate , in the application of the existing law			0
’ the archbishop said that palliative care for the dying was now at a level in this country where it was the envy of @entity114			0
‘ anything which changes this level of care is to be resisted with all our power , ’ he said			0
‘ anything which has the effect of minimising our protection of the most vulnerable is not something to which i believe we could ever assent			0
’ elderly patients are going abroad to have their suicidal demands met by foreign doctors the law against assisted suicide has been effectively eroded by prosecution guidelines published by @entity131 @entity130 in 2009			1
these broadly said that no family member is likely to be charged with assisted suicide if they have helped a love one to die out of compassion rather than greed			1
@entity27 ’s @entity25 proposed a system under which someone given 12 months or less to live would be able to ask a doctor to provide them with poison and help them take it			0
a series of safeguards to prevent abuse would include checks on the family and on the soundness of mind of the person asking to die			0
but the @entity19 was told the @entity25 ’s members were almost all known to be in favour of assisted dying and many influential individuals and charities had declined to help it by giving evidence			2
synod member @entity158 said : ‘ the @entity25 ’s proposals are essentially no different from those presented a few years ago to the @entity161 , where they were rejected on the basis of concerns about public safety			0
