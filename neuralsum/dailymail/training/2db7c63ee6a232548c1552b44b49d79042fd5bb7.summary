by @entity1 reporter published : 09:19 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 03:12 est , 9 november 2012 @entity2 is moving to within two years of deploying submarine - launched nuclear weapons and adding a new leg to its arsenal meaning it could lead to arms - reduction talks , according to a report by a congressionally mandated @entity10 commission			1
but in the meantime @entity2 , who will appoint a new leader on thursday , remains the ‘ most threatening ’ power in cyberspace and presents the largest challenge to @entity10 ’s supply chain integrity , the @entity12 and @entity11 said in a draft of its 2012 report to the @entity22			1
@entity24 is ‘ on the cusp of attaining a credible nuclear triad of land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarine - launched ballistic missiles , and air - dropped nuclear bombs , ’ the report said , adding that @entity2 was alone among the five original nuclear weapons states to be expanding its nuclear forces			1
the others are the @entity10 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
two years away : @entity2 are close to deploying submarine - launched nuclear weapons @entity2 has had a largely symbolic ballistic missile submarine capability for decades but is only now set to establish a ‘ near - continuous at - sea strategic deterrent , ’ the draft said the expansion of its nuclear forces will inevitably increase tensions in @entity44 , which is already jittery over the strengthening of the @entity2 military and its aggressive pursuit of territorial claims			1
it also could add to tensions with @entity51 , which is determined to contain @entity2 ’s reach into the @entity53			1
the move ‘ would necessarily affect @entity56 and @entity33 perceptions about the potency of their own deterrent capabilities vis - à - vis @entity2 , ’ the report said			1
threat : @entity2 are increasing its nuclear arsenal @entity2 is party to a number of international pacts and regimes regarding nuclear weapons and materials , including the @entity69			2
but it remains outside key arms limitation and control conventions , such as the @entity72 signed in april 2010 and the 1987 @entity73			0
the report said that @entity22 should require the @entity75 to spell out efforts to integrate @entity2 into existing and future nuclear arms reduction , limitation , and control discussions and agreements			2
@entity22 should also ‘ treat with caution ’ any proposal unilaterally to reduce operational @entity10 nuclear forces without clearer information being made available to the public about @entity2 ’s nuclear stockpile and force posture , it said			2
@entity2 is estimated to have a total of 240 nuclear warheads weapons , according to the @entity90 , a private nonpartisan group in @entity51			1
in contrast , the @entity10 has 5,113 , including tactical , strategic and nondeployed weapons			0
side - by - side : president @entity94 ( left ) and former president @entity95 ( right ) attend the opening session @entity24 has already deployed two of as many as five of a new class of nuclear - powered ballistic missile submarine			0
the jin - class boat is due to carry the @entity103 submarine - launched ballistic missile with an estimated range of about 4,600 miles ( 7,400km )			0
in its annual report on military and security developments involving @entity2 this year , the @entity105 said that the new submarines and the @entity103 missile would give @entity2 forces its ‘ first credible sea - based nuclear capability ’			0
although the @entity103 programme has faced repeated delays , it could reach an initial operating capability within the next two years , said the @entity105 report , which was released in may			0
the final version of the report is to be released next wednesday by the @entity10 - @entity2 commission , a 12 - member bipartisan group set up in 2000 to report to @entity22 on security implications of @entity10 - @entity2 trade .			0

country is two years from deploying subs
@entity2 still remains the most threatening power in cyberspace
news could add tension between @entity24 and @entity51
