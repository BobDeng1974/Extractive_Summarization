by @entity1 reporter published : 12:37 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 14:14 est , 12 september 2013 a 14 - ton molasses spill has killed thousands of fish and other marine life in @entity5 , the biggest environmental disaster @entity7 has ever faced			1
hundreds of suffocated sea creatures have already been collected since monday when a pipeline running from storage tanks to @entity12 ships spilled 233,000 gallons of molasses – enough to fill one - third of an olympic - size pool - into the water			1
health officials expect thousands more fish to die because the high concentration of the sugary , brown goo is sinking to the bottom of the ocean ' like a rock ' , making breathing difficult			1
the department has warned people to stay out of the area because the dead fish could attract sharks and other predators like barracuda			2
diver @entity63 made a seven - minute video showing the dead sea life - crabs , fish , eels and more - blanketing the bottom of the harbor			1
the water has turned a murky yellow - brown colour			0
' there ’s nothing alive there at all , ' he said			0
they ’re all dead and they ’re all just lying across the bottom - hundreds and hundreds , thousands			1
' state officials expect the spill 's brown plume will remain visible for weeks as tides and currents flush the molasses in to nearby @entity86 and out to sea			1
video source @entity88 @entity89 : a @entity91 worker pulls debris and dead fish from the water near the @entity12 shipyard in the @entity96 in @entity5 , @entity7 , after the molasses spill widespread : dead marine creatures were located at @entity99 , nearly three miles away from @entity100 ( pictured ) where the faulty pipe dumped the molasses into the water during loading onto a @entity12 ship on monday ripple effect : the molasses has spread into a number of @entity108 marinas and harbors up to three miles away from the site of the original spill @entity12 spokesman @entity112 said the company repaired the hole and the pipe stopped leaking on tuesday morning			1
however @entity56 reported the state could fine @entity12 up to $ 25,000 a day for violations of the @entity118			2
however the @entity47 has reportedly not decided whether to take action against @entity12 , which makes weekly runs of molasses from @entity7 ’s last sugar plantation to the mainland			1
the molasses is made at @entity7 's last sugar plantation , run by @entity127 on @entity128			2
meanwhile , the company said in a statement it was taking to steps to guard against future spills			0
' @entity12 regrets that the incident impacted many harbor users , as well as wildlife , ' it said			0
' we take our role as an environmental steward very seriously and have a strong record of leadership in the maritime industry on a number of fronts			0
' marine biologists said the effects in the harbor area will be long - lasting			0
' this is in a bay so there 's not a lot of circulation , so you 're not going to have flushing of this water out , ' dr. @entity148 , a visiting assistant professor of marine sciences at @entity150 , said			0
' so in this area where the spill occurred we 're probably going to see the effects for a long time			0
' as water does leave this bay area and goes out into the neighboring ocean , we can expect the effects in the long term , in days , weeks , months and probably years , to spread out over some of the @entity170 reefs			0
' the @entity171 has added crews to collect the dead fish and monitor water quality .			2
