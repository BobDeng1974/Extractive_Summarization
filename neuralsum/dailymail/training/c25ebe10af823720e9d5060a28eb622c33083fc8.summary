but help is on the way – in the form of a navigation system designed specially for shoppers			0
the ‘ shopnav ’ system turns smartphones into miniature guides , leading users to the outlet they need via the quickest route			2
the system downloads three dimensional plans from the internet - and ' guides ' shoppers to their destinations inside shopping malls there are several competing systems designed to prevent people being ' lost ' indoors - @entity29 and @entity30 champion versions where wi - fi networks and mobile phone networks offer rough ' positioning ' , whereas @entity35 's system relies on a sensor that works out how far a person has walked			1
but the development raises privacy concerns			0
armed with information about shoppers ’ movements thanks to the @entity44 - indoor positioning systems - stores could bombard them with offers tailored to them			1
engineers funded by the @entity49 government , have designed an interior gps - style system that can be operated from an everyday smartphone			2
project manager @entity35 got the idea from visiting a vast local ' megaplex shopping mall '			2
he said : ‘ i thought , ' would n't it be helpful if at such moments the smart phone could quickly shift to an interior space navigator and point the way through the rows of shops and stairwells			0
' ‘ the project designed a chip able to register how fast and how far the user is walking - and work out direction , so it can offer precise ' navigation ' information without having to contact a satellite , or even a mobile phone network			1
the project designed a chip able to register how fast and how far the user is walking - and work out direction , so it can offer precise ' navigation ' information without having to contact a satellite , or even a mobile phone network it downloads three dimensional plans from the internet but can also work ' on the go ' by scanning a @entity80 on the front entrance of a shopping mall or other building			1
this approach would mean that the ' sat nav ' does n't need to connect to mobile networks while indoors - often difficult - to receive information			1
qr codes , the small , square boxes of barcode - style patterns , are an increasingly popular way for companies to put out promotional information or a competition			0
for this app , the code would include the layout design of a building , not just shops but a tourist attraction or an exhibition hall holding a trade fair for instance			0
the results are to be demonstrated at a technology fair and exhibition , in @entity49 , later this month which will unveil a tiny navigator chip the size of a fingernail			2
this means one smartphone can be used by a number of different people without having to change the settings			0
@entity115 added : ‘ there has never before been a device so small that can accomplish so much			0

app downloads *3d* model of store and measures walking speed
new fingernail - size chip lets smartphones pinpoint location without satellites or mobile networks
' interior positioning system ' only works in certain buildings
@entity29 and @entity30 working on similar systems
