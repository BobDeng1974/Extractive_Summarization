by @entity0 and @entity1 many pregnant women do like to keep up with a gentle exercise routine while expecting , but it 's doubtful that many would fancy doing an 800m running race			1
however , a five - time @entity8 national champion did just that and ran it in just over two minutes - all while she was 34 - weeks pregnant			1
olympian @entity12 may have finished last in the race yesterday at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , but she said she enjoyed it and felt ' really good '			1
' her finishing time was 35 seconds slower than her personal best of 1:57.34 , which she smashed back in 2010 in a race in @entity29 , but is still a time many recreational runners would n't be able to achieve			1
nicknamed the ' flying flower ' thanks to always racing with one in her hair , she joked her biggest fear was being lapped in @entity38 race			2
' i just did n't want to get lapped and be the first person to get lapped in the 800 , ' said @entity12			1
feeling fine : olympian @entity12 finished last in the race but still ran at a pace many would struggle to achieve she has grown up training and competing so did n't want to stop while pregnant - and her doctors said there was no reason why she could n't carry on the 28 - year - old is expecting her first baby with her husband @entity48 , who she married in 2011			1
doctors gave montano the ok to take part in the race and she hopes it dispels misconceptions over exercise and pregnancy			1
' that took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy , ' @entity12 said of getting her doctor 's approval			1
@entity12 has been training and competing since she was a child and was glad to find there was no reason why she should n't continue while expecting			1
' what i found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby ... i did all the things i normally do ... i just happened to be pregnant			1
this is my normal this year , ' she said			0
she knew she had no chance of winning or running at her best during the race but emphasises that was n't the point			2
she wanted to take part for the joy of racing			2
she writes on her blog that she thinks it 's important that people - whatever their ability - remember that it 's the taking part in sport that counts			2
' @entity89 is still very enjoyable for me because i 've been able to think of it like a kid does			0
they 're so innocent - they 're wanting to win but they 're having fun , too , ' she writes			0
' as you get older , it 's easy to put importance on things that really do n't matter and then succumb to that pressure ; so i do n't like to get myself wrapped up by talking about competitive goals too much			0
' good effort : @entity12 , a four - time national champion in the 800 , came in last in her heat with a time a 2 minutes , 32.3 seconds and received a standing ovation doctor 's orders : her doctors encouraged her to participate , which , she says , took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy seasoned athlete : @entity12 competing before her pregnancy			1
she was 5th in the @entity116 , right flying flower : her pace in the race while pregnant was a lot slower than she usually goes around the track when racing experts say it 's safe for women who are used to keeping fit like @entity12 to carry on exercising while pregnant - albeit at a lower intensity than before			1
the pace @entity12 ran at in the race while pregnant would certainly be a more leisurely one for her than usual - in the @entity116 in @entity129 , she came 5th with a time under two minutes			1
it seems likely she will get back into training when it 's safe to do so after having her baby and she has admitted one of her dreams is to one day open a personal fitness studio for working parents - where they can bring their children along to keep fit too			0
run for fun : she 's used to winning races but said it 's the taking part that counts fitness advocate : @entity12 would one day like to open a fitness centre for families she said : ' i want to teach people about exercise and fitness and how it can be really fun , and i want to help parents educate their children about it , because that 's where everything starts			1
' she 's certainly not the first to pull on her jogging shoes while pregnant and she wo n't be the last			0
@entity156 famously came under fire when she revealed in 2012 that at 20 weeks pregnant with her second child , she was still running six miles a day			0
like @entity160 athletes including @entity161 and @entity162 , who ran moderately throughout their pregnancies and went on to have healthy babies , @entity156 decreased the intensity as well as length of her runs to alleviate any risk to herself and her unborn child			0
before she conceived , she had been running 90 miles a week while training for the @entity170 so six miles a day was a significant reduction in mileage			0
yet despite @entity156 taking all the precautions recommended by medical professionals , she has still faced outrage from people who have accused her of putting her baby at risk through exercise			0
keeping fit : @entity156 was still running six miles a day while pregnant with her second child , but this is a big step down from the mileage she did when training to run sub three hours at the @entity170 in 2012 , right she told the @entity184 at the time : ' when i tell people i 'm still exercising , they react as if i 've told them i 've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant			1
but what i 'm doing is actually good for me and my baby			0
' @entity156 said she felt good being active and that by being fit , she felt better prepared for child birth			0
' i feel like keeping fit is preparing me for the labour - which will be harder than running a marathon ! ' she said			0
@entity156 's belief that fitness aids labour is is backed up by studies that have found that babies of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because ' fetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers , ' according to the @entity207 ( @entity207 )			0
famous example : @entity161 reduced her training but carried on running when she was pregnant , as pictured here when taking part in a fun run with her daughter @entity212 while carrying her son along with official @entity215 guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers , the @entity207 also advocate exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy and precautions are taken such as not exercising at a high intensity to raise the heart rate to its maximum and not running while it 's too hot due to a risk of overheating			1
they state : ' in most cases , exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefits associated with such activities			1
' they add that it 's a fallacy that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby stating ' women should be advised that adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are not increased for exercising women			2
' fears that a baby will be shaken and distressed in the womb are misguided as a baby is well - insulated by fluid to protect it			0
@entity207 explain that exercising while pregnant has numerous benefits for the mother 's health and wellbeing			0
' maternal benefits appear to be both physical and psychological in nature			0
many common complaints of pregnancy , including fatigue , varicosities and swelling of extremities , are reduced in women who exercise			2
additionally , active women experience less insomnia , stress , anxiety and depression , ' they state			0
women who exercise while pregnant will also gain less excess weight , lowering the health risks associated with obesity			2
speaking about whether it 's safe to run while pregnant , maternal health expert @entity280 , @entity281 , told women 's running : ' running is safe anytime - during the first , second and third trimester - if you are having an uncomplicated pregnancy			1
' you should not run if you have complications like elevated blood pressure or , in some cases , multiple gestation , that would cause an obstetrician to advise no high - impact exercise			2
' just because you 're pregnant does n’t mean you ca n’t stay in shape			0
all of the same reasons you normally exercise - heart health , stress reduction , weight maintenance , lower blood pressure - are reasons to run during pregnancy			1
' additionally , women who exercise while pregnant have lower rates of diabetes and preeclampsia , and they are less likely to gain an unhealthy ( and potentially dangerous ) amount of weight			2
there 's even some data that suggests babies born to women who worked out while expecting have stronger cardiovascular systems			0
