click here to check out @entity9 's work on @entity10 click here to follow @entity28 on twitter click here to check out @entity32 ' work on the @entity12 click here to follow @entity12 on twitter games between @entity4 and @entity3 are always among the most hard - fought of the season feeling confident ? dt : i am , despite monday ’s game ( 1 - 0 win over @entity40 ) i think we ’ve our best chance in years of getting a good result ; even more so than last season at @entity45			1
@entity46 : the performance against @entity48 came at just the right time to instil some confidence in fans and the players			2
it was n't the win , it was the tempo but that being said , it is @entity5			0
when was the last time @entity4 played well there ? @entity56 and @entity57 come head - to - head in a @entity60 clash that is vital for both teams what would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game ? dt : considering how @entity4 have fallen in recent years , it means a lot more in the grand scheme of finishing in the top four			1
@entity4 ’s scalp for us is still a big one but the three points are just as – if not more important			0
@entity46 : it is and always will be the biggest game of the season and sunday is the biggest game between the clubs in years			2
both have a lot on the line and so much to lose , so it is going to be an intense atmosphere , more so than usual			0
@entity4 fans have always viewed @entity3 as their biggest game of the season , this year it 's even bigger is this the biggest rivalry in @entity91 football ? dt : without a doubt , regardless of what @entity93 or @entity94 fans like to think – it ’s still the first one i look for when the fixture list comes out			1
@entity46 : without question it is the biggest rivalry			1
@entity93 might be challengers now but @entity4 fans spent decades laughing at them trying to hold on to our coat tails and as for @entity106 , that rivalry has been forced on to everybody thanks to @entity108			2
i miss the old days of @entity110 being a bitter rival but although that feeling has dampened in recent years , the rivalry with @entity3 has never lost its potency			1
@entity0 's @entity115 argues with @entity116 during a @entity4 - @entity3 clash back in 2010 matches between the two sides are always potent - it is the biggest rivalry in @entity91 football , say the fans @entity123 encourages the @entity4 support ahead of @entity3 rival @entity125 after a @entity4 win in 2012 what was your take on @entity4 's 3 - 0 win over @entity3 in december ? dt : it was particularly miserable , as it felt as if our previous season was just a one - off			1
obviously , we ’re back to something like last season ’s form now but that was hard to take , as i felt we deserved something			0
@entity46 : what a cracking game that was but the 3 - 0 over @entity48 last weekend was much more convincing			1
we were vibrant in attack against @entity3 yet defensively we were weak and it was all about @entity144 's heroics			2
if not for an outstanding performance from him , it could have been very different			0
@entity57 scored @entity4 's opener in an impressive 3 - 0 win at @entity45 when @entity3 were struggling @entity150 added a second goal for the home side to compound @entity3 's misery under @entity155 @entity156 scored the third goal but @entity3 and @entity155 have not lost in the league since that day what 's changed for both teams since that result ? dt : i do n’t think much has changed for @entity4 , they ’re still winning games , often without being the better side , but they were good against @entity48 , which could be a concern			1
@entity3 have improved so drastically though , and it would n’t be an overstatement to say that a bit of better early - season form would ’ve seen another title challenge			2
@entity46 : @entity3 have n't lost in the @entity60 since then which says it all			1
they 've had a @entity174 renaissance akin to what @entity4 did annually under sir @entity176 and come into the game on sunday as the league 's in - form side			1
on the other hand , @entity4 have been a mixed bag all season but have been able to grind out a lot of results as well , so we 've become quite hard to beat which is certainly progress			0
@entity187 scored @entity3 's winner at @entity40 in the latest impressive result of a good run of form @entity57 starred in @entity4 's 3 - 0 win over @entity48 which kept up hope of finishing in the top four @entity194 is free from suspension to return to the @entity4 team			1
is that a good or a bad thing ? dt : sadly , it makes little difference			0
he ’s one of the world ’s best but @entity202 just does n’t know what to do with him			0
here ’s hoping he starts him up front again ! @entity46 : you ca n't underestimate any world - class player regardless of what form they are in			2
before his red card against @entity110 , @entity194 actually had his best 45 minutes in a long time and his pin - point cross set up @entity57 's equaliser			2
i expect him to come straight back into the starting @entity215 because of his pace as @entity4 will more than likely set - up on the counter-attack as we did away to @entity110			0
with @entity219 and @entity57 bang in form , @entity4 should have some great pace up front			0
@entity194 returns after being sent off in the @entity223 against @entity110 , and could start for @entity4 do you expect @entity225 to start for @entity3 ? dt : no , and nor should he			1
he was solid and calmed us down when he came on on monday but if the game has any of the usual frantic pace about it he ’ll be our major weak link			0
@entity46 : i really hope @entity3 get caught up in the sentimental wave of @entity225 's last derby and start him but i ca n't see it happening			1
they 're a better side without him as @entity187 has stepped it up this year			0
@entity155 may elect to leave his captain @entity225 on the bench as he continues to recover from injury what are your plans for the day of the game ? dt : i usually find the games against @entity4 too nerve - wracking so i tend to not be around other people			1
there ’s usually a lot of work to do on the day of the match too so , i ’ll most likely watch with family or by myself and hope i do n’t have to drown my sorrows later on ! @entity46 : it 's an early kick - off so wo n't be much time to do anything before 1.30 comes around			0
as there 's so much riding on this game , i 'll probably just be a bag of nerves right up until the first whistle			0
@entity259 is n't quite back to his best after returning from injury but could have a key role to play what would a win for your team do to their @entity268 qualification prospects ? dt : i would n’t say a win for either side would seal the other ’s fate but i do believe if @entity3 win then the confidence the three points would bring would be incredible in terms of momentum , it may even lead to a push for third or ( whisper it ) second			1
@entity46 : a win for either side would be absolutely massive			0
it would give @entity4 a very nice cushion over @entity3 and consolidate our spot in fourth and for @entity3 , it would see them leapfrog @entity4			2
it 's all to play for			0
@entity3 supporters are eyeing up @entity93 's second spot in the @entity60 if they beat @entity4 @entity4 manager @entity202 has already stated his belief that his team can catch their local rivals @entity93 the last six meetings have all had a winner and the bookies expect @entity3 to be victorious here			1
what 's your prediction ? dt : i ’m going to say a less comfortable win than we ’d hope but still , i ’m going for a 2 - 0 to @entity3			1
@entity46 : i 'm going to disagree with the bookies here and go for a draw			0
it 's a derby so anything can happen and form usually does n't count for much			0
both sides are going to have chances as there are defensive weaknesses in @entity4 and @entity3			2
hopefully @entity4 can be as clinical as they were against @entity48 but away at @entity5 is a different kettle of fish			2
my prediction ? a score draw : 1 - 1			0
the bookmakers think @entity3 and midfielder @entity315 will come out on top in sunday 's showdown			1

@entity3 host @entity4 in the @entity60 on sunday
@entity3 are the in - form side and have n't lost in the league this year
@entity4 instilled some confidence with 3 - 0 win over @entity48
we ask @entity9 and @entity11 questions ahead of the showdown
the two clubs share arguably the biggest rivalry in @entity91 football
@entity334 vs @entity335 : @entity225 not in @entity337 's team as @entity116 picks @entity194
