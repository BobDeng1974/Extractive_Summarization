i tried so hard not to replay it in my head for ages			0
' ms @entity33 ’s ex-husband , stockbroker @entity78 was allowed to address the hearing and suggested to mr @entity52 : ‘ most adults in this room are drivers and we would n’t drive over something in the road with the form of a body for fear of damaging the car			0
’ speaking very quietly , he replied : ‘ i just thought it was debris			0
