the number of children being educated in primary schools of at least 800 pupils has risen almost fourfold in three years			1
about 52,000 youngsters are currently taught in these ‘ titan ’ primaries , compared with 13,700 in 2010			0
and 5,350 are squeezed into primary schools with more than 1,000 pupils , according to data released by the @entity10 under the @entity11			1
it is claimed primary schools had to expand after a lack of forward planning under @entity16 ( file photo ) not a single primary school across @entity19 housed so many children in 2010			1
the rise in super-size primaries comes amid a school place crisis which this september left councils struggling to cope with the huge influx of pupils			2
eager : but more and more pupils are being crammed into the same schools ( posed by model ) the @entity31 revealed how youngsters were packed ‘ like sardines ’ into oversized classes , with former police stations and even factory car parks used for lessons			2
a baby boom that began more than a decade ago , rising immigration and hard - up parents opting out of the private sector have been blamed for the problem			0
@entity10 data shows ‘ titan ’ primary schools have become a common way to cope with spiralling pupil numbers following a lack of forward planning under @entity16			1
this is despite the fact that parents and education experts fear children as young as four become ‘ lost ’ in these extra large schools			2
between january 2012 and january this year , numbers of pupils in 800 - plus primaries rose by 48 per cent			1
the number in schools of more than 1,000 children more than doubled , from 2,100 to 5,350 over the same period			0

barking and @entity84 council , @entity82 , even admitted it was considering three - day weeks			0
professor @entity85 , of @entity86 , said ‘ titan ’ schools may make economic sense but do not pay ‘ sufficient regard to the development of our children ’ , adding that they can be ‘ overwhelming ’			0
the @entity94 found some parts of @entity19 could see nearly twice as many pupils as places in two years .			0

data released by education chiefs under @entity11
