on 9 july this year , the internet will suddenly ' turn off ' for thousands of users around the world			1
around 350,000 pc users have machines infected with an invisible , undetectable ' @entity6 ' computer virus called @entity7 , which sends users of the web to unintended - and sometimes illegal - sites			2
when the @entity11 detected the infection they set up ' surrogate ' servers to keep the infected pcs working - but it 's costing so much that they intend to ' pull the plug ' on 9 july			1
around 350,000 pc users have machines infected with an invisible , undetectable ' @entity6 ' computer virus sending users to unintended and illegal sites infected : the @entity7 ' could cause millions - including @entity22 companies - to lose their internet if the @entity11 shuts down surrogate servers court order : the @entity11 will retire their surrogate servers by march 8 ' if we just pulled the plug on their criminal infrastructure , the victims were going to be without internet service , ' said @entity32 , an @entity11 agent talking to @entity33			1
according to @entity35 , servers function by translating traditional website urls to their ‘ numeric counterpart			0
’ but computers with the @entity6 , which originally emerged in @entity39 , will send users to fraudulent websites			0
and , if the @entity11 shuts off their emergency servers , millions of people could potentially be without @entity23			0
the temporary servers set up by the @entity11 were created to allow companies to remove the worm from their infected servers ; those affected had 120 days to get rid of the malware			2
after @entity11 warnings , the number of pcs infected with the @entity6 has plunged - and most are in the hands of private individuals , not companies			1
of the 350,000 infected machines worldwide , 85,000 are in the @entity57 and 20,000 are in the @entity58			1
ticking clock : the @entity11 's surrogate servers can run until march 8 , at which point they will either have to be shut down or run by a court - ordered extension the malware is especially effective , @entity65 reports , because it blocks infected users from visiting secure sites that could help them rid of the worm			2
law enforcement officials and the computer industry have been working together in a coalition to fight the malware			0
the group , called the @entity75 , will examine possibilities to fixing the problem			0
if no solution is reached , millions of people could be without the @entity23 , @entity35 reports .			0
