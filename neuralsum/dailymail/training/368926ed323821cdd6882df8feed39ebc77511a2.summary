by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 04:13 est , 8 january 2014 this remote property has become an island in a sea of flood water - after its owner spent three years building a 6ft high clay bank to protect it			1
@entity8 , 71 , lives 200 yards from the @entity9 on the @entity10 and her 150 - year - old property used to be flooded nearly every winter			1
but , after repeatedly bailing out the house , her late husband @entity17 - a former @entity16 lieutenant - encircled his two - acre garden with a floodbank			1
protection : this property 200 yards from the @entity9 on the @entity10 was previously regularly flooded until the owner built an earth wall around it nowadays : the couple were attracted by the romance of the rural wilderness which flowers into a paradise during summer months how it used to look : @entity17 and @entity8 's flood - prone home in @entity33 , near @entity34 , pictured in the 1990s before the flood barrier was built now , more than a decade later , the defences are still holding and widowed mrs @entity8 is dry as the fields around her are submerged under 3ft of water			1
she said today : ‘ the defence was my husband ’s idea - he decided the beautiful house did not always need to flood			1
‘ the land has flooded for the past two years and the defence has still held so i ’m very grateful for it			0
i have lots of moral support now i ’m on my own			0
‘ friends bring me things and helpfully drive me to my car			0
’ mrs @entity8 and her retired husband bought the flood - prone home in @entity33 , near @entity34 , in 1994			1
the couple were attracted by the romance of the rural wilderness which flowers into a paradise during summer months			0
but each year they paid the price of buying a property which became a lonely island almost every winter			2
flooding was so regular that they kept a boat tied up outside the living - room window and would have to use it to make the mile - long trip to the ‘ mainland ’			0
man on a boat : mrs @entity8 and her retired @entity16 lieutenant husband @entity17 ( pictured ) bought the flood - prone home in in 1994 bright idea : after repeatedly bailing out the house , the @entity77 encircled his two - acre garden with a clay floodbank mrs @entity8 said : ‘ what we did was to put about a three metre bank of clay all the way around the property so the water itself does not come into the house or the gardens			1
’ ' the defence was my husband ’s idea - he decided the beautiful house did not always need to flood			1
the land has flooded for the past two years and the defence has still held so i 'm very grateful for it ' @entity8 but the years have taken their toll on the wall and it has sprung a few leaks			2
mrs @entity8 added : ‘ it keeps the water out ( but ) also keeps it in , so i ’m currently pumping out water from where it got in through a few holes			2
‘ i have two electric pumps and the @entity110 have been nice enough to lend me another			0
’ the house has now been marooned for a week and mrs @entity8 is being ferried to the ‘ mainland ’ - where she has left her car - by a friend in a tractor			2
‘ i have been coming and going with a friend picking me up with a tractor which is working quite well , ’ she said			0
‘ i have been parking my @entity119 up on the river bank so i can transfer into that and go about as i wish			0

@entity8 lives 200 yards from @entity9 in @entity10 and her property was flooded nearly every winter

more than a decade later , flood defences are still holding and the home is dry rather than being under 3ft of water
