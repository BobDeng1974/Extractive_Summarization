by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 07:41 est , 14 january 2014 the @entity3 ’s black hole is about to gobble up its first dinner , and astronomers are hoping to have front row seats when it happens			1
a huge gas cloud , about three times the mass of @entity10 , is on course to collide with the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in march			1
astronomers expect the gas cloud will swing so close to the black hole that it will heat up to the point where it produces spectacular x-rays			1
pictured here is a simulation of how the gas cloud might appear after close approach to the black hole at the centre of the @entity3 the gas cloud , dubbed @entity29 , was first discovered by astronomers in @entity31 in 2011			1
they expected it to hit the black hole , called @entity35 ( pronounced @entity35 by astronomers ) , late last year			1
that did n't happen , but the cloud continues to drift closer			0
astronomers now predict that the impact will occur in the next few months			0
when it does , the x-rays produced from the impact could help scientists understand how black holes eat matter and shed light on the evolution of galaxy			1
the galactic center as imaged by the @entity49			0
this image is a montage of all data obtained in the monitoring programme from 2006 - 2013 @entity35 lurks 26,000 light years away in the @entity3 's innermost region			0
even for a black hole , it is very dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery			2
black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back			1
the way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy			0
the collision will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes feed			2
they hope to understand these black holes do n't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies			1
the findings could shed light on how stars are formed , how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies			1
‘ astronomers around the world are eagerly awaiting the first sign that this interaction has begun , ’ said @entity83 , a team member at @entity84 in @entity85			0
scientists saw what they thought was a sign in april , when @entity95 ’s @entity94 telescope detected a powerful high - energy burst and a dramatic rise in the x-ray brightness of the @entity35 region			0
they were excited to discover the activity came from separate source very near the black hole : a rare subclass of neutron star			2
a neutron star is the crushed core of a star destroyed by a supernova explosion , packing the equivalent mass of a half - million earths into a sphere no wider than @entity112			0
the neutron star , named @entity113 - 29 , is a magnetar , meaning its magnetic field is thousands of times stronger than an average neutron star			0
only 26 magnetars have been identified to date			0
the discovery of @entity113 - 29 may aid scientists in their exploration of important properties of the @entity35 black hole			2
black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back			1
the way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy — how stars are formed , how the galaxy grows , how it interacts with other galaxies			2
@entity35 lurks 26,000 light years away in the @entity3 's innermost region			0
for a black hole it is dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery			2
the collision will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes , such as the @entity3 ’s , feed and perhaps why they do n't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies			1
black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back			1
the way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy black holes themselves are invisible and do n't permit light to escape , the material falling into them shines in x-rays			1
while astronomers expect to see a change in brightness , they do n't know how dramatic it will be because they are n't sure exactly what the gaseous @entity29 object is			0
if it 's all gas , the region would glow in the x-ray band for years to come as the black hole slowly swallows the cloud			1
another possibility is that @entity29 could be shrouding an old star			0
if that 's the case , the display would be less spectacular as @entity35 slurped from the cloud while the star slipped by , dense enough to fight its grasp			0
‘ i would be delighted if @entity187 * suddenly became 10,000 times brighter			0
however it is possible that it will not react much — like a horse that wo n't drink when led to water , ’ said @entity185 , a @entity186 associate professor of astronomy			0
‘ if @entity35 consumes some of @entity29 , we can learn about black holes accreting at low levels — sneaking midnight snacks			1
it is potentially a unique window into how most black holes in the present - day universe accrete			2

the gas cloud , named @entity29 , is *due* to collide with the black hole in march
when it does , astronomers believe it will produce spectacular x-rays
these x-rays could help scientists understand how black holes eat matter
the *observations* could shed light on the evolution of galaxy and help scientists better understand how stars are formed
