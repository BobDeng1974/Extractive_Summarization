by @entity0 the @entity1 might be public enemy number one to the @entity4 government , but that has n't stopped the people there adopting some of the @entity1 's most enduring capitalist symbols , from @entity9 to @entity10			1
photographer @entity11 , who has since been banned from visiting the @entity13 rogue state , travelled widely in @entity4 before being ejected			2
there , he was given the rare opportunity to talk to locals about their world view			0
from talk of ' @entity1 imperialists ' to the aggressively anti-american education system , the @entity4 view of the @entity19 is one controlled by the government , in a country where the people lack free access to information			1
many insisted to @entity29 that @entity9 - plastered over children 's lunchboxes - is @entity32 , and @entity10 , known as @entity33 , is a local invention			1
' even in the official paintings made by @entity38 artists , you see @entity40 characters that came via the @entity32 products that are everywhere in @entity4 , ' reveals @entity11			1
' most of the people ignore the meaning			0
' @entity4 say ' crabonated @entity33 ' aka @entity10 is is local invention did you notice that man ? he ’s wearing an @entity1 cap ! guide : ' it 's not an @entity1 cap mr @entity55 - it 's a @entity32 one			1
' @entity40 , @entity4 style : do you know the name of this character on the fan ? guide : ' no mr @entity55			2
it 's just a mouse			0
it ’s @entity32 ! ' what do @entity1 tourists say after visiting the @entity67 ? guide : ' they ask for forgiveness for all the crimes that their country has done			1
' in @entity73 , @entity4 's second largest city : will a man be sent to prison if he steals a bicycle ? guide : ' we do n't have terrorism like in the @entity1 in @entity4			1
' not impressed : i have read on an @entity1 website that the people in the subway are actors ... guide : ' they talk nonsense mr @entity55			2
i hate @entity1 ! ' ' but @entity1 can visit the country , although they can only enter or exit the country by plane and can not spend more than 10 days there			1
' once there , visitors from the @entity1 will find themselves shadowed by official guides			2
' the guides know that there are drugs , crime , unemployment and strikes in the @entity1 , so whenever they can , they like to tell you that in @entity4 , they do n't have these kinds of problems			1
' more sinister are the posters exhorting people to shoot @entity1 - an attitude that even extends to the education system			1
' it is exciting to play soldier and kill @entity1 ' , reads the slogan on one poster photographed by @entity11			2
asked why they put it in a school , his guide replied : ' @entity1 have teased us for a long time			2
that ’s why we always give an anti-american education to our kids			2
' update : do you hear news from the rest of the world ? guide : of course mr. @entity55 ! we even hear @entity1 news			2
for example , i know @entity1 have walked on the @entity127 ' financial advice : was @entity4 affected by the economic crisis ? guide : ' not all mr @entity55 : we ’re not capitalists like @entity1 ! ' in the demilitarised zone : why are no @entity1 or @entity135 soldiers on the other side of the border ? @entity4 colonel : ' it 's 12.30 - the @entity1 are having lunch ! ' later that day : ' today you can see the @entity1 soldiers with their puppets , mr @entity55 ! ' their puppets ? ' yes , the @entity135 soldiers , this is what we call them			1
' defensive : what are those blocks on the highway for ? guide : ' in case of invasion by the @entity1 and their puppets			2
they are designed to fall on the road to block them			0
' unsurprisingly , many children , especially in rural areas , react with fear to the sight of a foreign face			0
' i asked my guide why children ran away when they saw me and she told me that because i have short hair , they thought i was an @entity1 parachutist , ' says @entity11			2
others blame ' @entity1 imperialists ' for everything from food shortages to power blackouts			1
' i was in a @entity176 art gallery one day and the power went off , ' remembers @entity11			0
' i asked if it happened every day and the guy in there said : " yes			0
that is the @entity1 imperialists fault ! " ' asked by @entity11 why he does n't like @entity1 , one local repied : ' they meddle in everything mr. @entity55 ! nobody likes them ! the whole world is against them : @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , everyone ! and @entity192 ! ' others like to enjoy a chuckle at the expense of @entity1 tourists			1
' yes , they can come here , ' one local student told @entity11			0
' but we only allow them to stay for three days and we make them pay a lot of money ! ' paranoid : guide : ' mr @entity55 , you speak too much to this @entity1 tourist ... ' what ¿ s the problem ? ' we think she is a fox			1
' a fox ? ' a spy			0
' tourism : @entity1 tourists come to @entity4 ? guide : we only allow them to stay for three days , and we make them pay a lot of money ! ' not amused : is there any @entity1 you admire , an athlete , a politician , an artist ? @entity4 student : ' nobody mr @entity55 ! ' bleak : do you have homelessness in @entity4 ? guide : ' no , here is not like @entity1 , mr. @entity55			1
our system is much more developed ' on the road : it ’s a @entity231 ! it 's an @entity1 car ! guide : ' @entity234			1
in @entity176 we have two			0
' but this car consumes 20 litres for every 100 km ! ' well that ’s not good			0
' the board says : ' it is exciting to play soldier and kill @entity1 '			0
why ? ' @entity1 have teased us a long time			0
that 's why we give an anti-american education to our kids			1
despite the jibes , @entity11 says that @entity1 are made to feel welcome by local people who evidently do n't share the regime 's dim view of the @entity1 and its @entity135 ally			1
' i met many @entity1 tourists during my six trips and most of them were surprised by how welcome they were made to feel by the guides and the local people , ' says @entity11			1
' the reality is far from the aggressive propaganda stuff that you can read in the official statements made by the regime			0
the tourists are allowed to go everywhere apart from the @entity261 area , where everyone else can go and can sleep in the homes of @entity4 farming families by the sea			2
' of course , there was no explanation given - they just told me , " it 's not possible ! " ' early education : the murals decorating a wall on a school in @entity176 : the @entity1 is symbolised by the wolf killed by the @entity4 soldier power cut : local man : ' well mr @entity55 , there is an electricity cut			1
' it happens every day ? ' yes			0
. that ’s the @entity1 imperialists ' fault			0
' smoking : guide : ' mr @entity55 , the soldier is asking you if you have a cigarette ? ' i only have @entity1 ones ! ' it is not a problem			0
' ludicrous : one of the more ridiculous statements made to @entity29 was : ' look there mr @entity55 ! that dog acts like @entity1 : it lies down in front of @entity4 ! ' fright : ' why do the children run away when they see me ? guide : ' as you have short hair , they think you ’re an @entity1 parachutist mr @entity55			1
' police state : there are a lot of policemen in @entity176 ... guide : ' yes , the city is very safe , you can go out at night , and will not be attacked like in @entity1			0
' empty : shop owner : ' there is everything in our shops			0
the @entity1 tell lies when they talk about shortages			0
' no one is here			0
' it is not the right time ; people are working			0
' @entity176 fun fair : what do the people shoot at ? guide : ' at targets that symbolise @entity1 gis ! ' and what ’s written on them ? ' kill the @entity1 imperialists ' aggressive : while on board the @entity328 , captured by the regime in 1968 , @entity55 asked : who are the enemies of @entity4 ? female soldier : ' @entity332 is the @entity1 , for sure ! '			1

according to the @entity4 , @entity9 is @entity32 while @entity10 is a local drink
unfortunately , they did n't quite get @entity10 's name right , calling it crabonated @entity33 instead
the @entity1 looms large over @entity4 and is blamed for everything from power cuts to *war*
education system is aggressively anti-american although students still use @entity346 soft*war*e
americans are allowed to visit the country but can only stay for 10 days according to @entity350
