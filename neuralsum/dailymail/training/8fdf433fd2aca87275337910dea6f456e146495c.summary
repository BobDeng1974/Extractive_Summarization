by @entity1 reporter published : 07:11 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 20 june 2013 crash victim : @entity3 , 20 , a student from @entity4 , died after being hit by a lorry at a junction a lorry with a faulty indicator crushed a cyclist to death without the driver even realising what he had done , an inquest heard yesterday			1
a loose bulb in the indicator meant that @entity3 had no idea the vehicle was turning into her path			1
the 20 - year - old tourism undergraduate suffered multiple injuries and died almost instantly as she went under its front wheel			1
witnesses told @entity23 they did not see driver @entity24 indicate before making the left turn			1
his lorry was later found to have had a bulb fitted incorrectly to its left side indicator			1
road traffic collision investigator @entity30 told the inquest : ' it was n't that it was broken as such , it was that the bulb was n't fitted correctly			1
' it 's possible that a cyclist travelling on the near side of the lorry may not have known it was making a left turn because they could not see the indicator			2
' eyewitnesses said they did n't see the driver indicate before it hit @entity45 , a management and tourism student at @entity48			1
@entity50 patrolman @entity49 said : ' the front wheel of the lorry went over her			2
' i told him he had driven over a cyclist			2
i told him several times and pointed her out under the wheel			2
i was shocked that he had not noticed			2
' the accident happened at the junction between @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity61 , north @entity63 , on april 5 , 2011			1
mr @entity24 , who was acquitted of causing death by careless driving at a subsequent trial , told the inquest that he did not see @entity45 , who had come to @entity68 from @entity4 two years earlier			1
he said : ' as i moved off i checked all my mirrors			0
i was stationary at the lights , then they changed to green and it 's then that i indicated			0
' i did not know about the defect with the indicator light			0
i checked it that morning			0
i checked the lights and the tyres			0
' recording a verdict of death by road traffic collision , deputy coroner @entity80 said : ' i have come to no conclusion about whether or not the indicators were activated by the driver of the lorry			1
junction accident : @entity3 , 20 , who had been in @entity68 for two years , was studying a management and tourism at @entity48 ' the deceased was riding her pedal cycle and as she approached the lights she came to a standstill to the left of the lorry			1
she was not visible to the driver , even through his rear and side view mirrors			2
' the rear side indicator was defective and the deceased was not aware the lorry was turning left			1
' my verdict is one of road traffic collision			0
i am afraid this is n't the first such case of this type			0
i have done many over the years			0
' there 's a great conflict on @entity63 roads between users			1
great dangers arise when cyclists and lorries come into contact with one and other			0
it 's always the cyclist that comes off worse			0
' perhaps the only comfort we can take is that this death did not involve a lot of suffering as miss @entity3 was unconscious almost instantaneously			1
' accident spot : student @entity3 was cycling straight along @entity61 ( pictured ) when she was hit by the lorry as it made a left turn into @entity62 at the junction after the inquest @entity3 's angry mother , @entity131 , who travelled over from @entity4 for the hearing , said : ' we did n't know this was an inquest , we thought it was the court case			1
we have only found out the driver had been acquitted			2
' we 're shocked and angry			0
there has been no communication			0
we have been waiting for two years for justice			0
after hearing the evidence we still have doubts and want to take the matter further			0
justice would make the matter easier to take			0
' paying tribute to her ' special ' daughter , she added : ' she had big dreams			0
' she had lived in @entity63 for two years and loved it here			1
she loved people and wanted to travel the world			0
' a spokesman for the @entity154 campaign said : ‘ crashes with large lorries account for about half the cyclist deaths in @entity63			1
' we at the @entity158 have been campaigning to improve the equipment on lorries and for all drivers to have extra training including sessions riding a bike			0
' it is difficult to understand how the driver in this case was acquitted for failing to see @entity3			1
if he was turning into a " blind spot " he should have done it with extreme care			2
‘ we have called for that junction to be made safer with a safe area for cyclists but to date nothing has been done			2
