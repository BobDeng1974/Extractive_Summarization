a village of just 1,000 residents in @entity2 has been forced to raise taxes because an @entity5 refugee and her seven children cost the local authority £ 40,000 in benefits every month			1
@entity11 , in the @entity2 canton of @entity10 , is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from @entity17 in @entity18 three years ago			1
the massive benefits bill covers day - to - day living expenses such as groceries and cleaning costs , as well as paying for four of the woman 's children to be housed in an orphanage and even bills for general entertainment - such as guided tours of local attractions and entry fees for the zoo			2
outraged : @entity11 ( pictured ) , in the @entity2 canton of @entity10 , is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from @entity17 in @entity18 three years ago the @entity17 woman and her family arrived in @entity11 three years ago in possession of a visa allowing her to stay in @entity2 for five years , with the option to extend her stay beyond that date			1
it is not known if the family had lived elsewhere in @entity2 before moving to the quiet village			0
solely to cover the cost of the family 's massive benefits bill , the local authority is now planning to raise taxes in the village by a shocking five per cent			2
' i do n't know where to turn			0
i think we have no other choice but to raise taxes , ' mayor @entity53 told daily @entity2 newspaper @entity57			0
she added that local residents were justifiably outraged by the spiraling costs of caring for the family , who require a team of social workers to spend six hours a day , six days a week on them alone			0
the family arrived in @entity11 after spending time at a @entity2 immigration centre , like the one pictured above when the woman and her family arrived in @entity11 three years ago , the municipal government immediately agreed to cover the full cost of their rent and £ 1,700 a month in living expenses			1
a short time later the woman sought further financial help , claiming she had become overwhelmed by family commitments and was now struggling to look after all seven of her children			0
this resulted in four of them being sent to an orphanage - with the local authority paying out £ 6,000 for each child every month - a total cost of £ 24,000			1
£ 24,000 - cost of looking after four children at the local orphanage £ 13,000 - @entity83 worker expenses £ 1,700 - general living expenses allowance £ 1,300 - housing costs and entertainment bills on top of this there are also the costs of helping the woman pay her cooking and cleaning bills - plus rolling entertainment expenses , such as paying the entry fee for all eight family members at the zoo			1
as well as straight handouts , the family also reportedly cost the local authority thousands more every month by tying up social workers and carers for six hours a day , six days a week			2
on average these social workers cost the council about £ 90 every hour they work , rising to £ 95 an hour in the evening or at weekends .			0
