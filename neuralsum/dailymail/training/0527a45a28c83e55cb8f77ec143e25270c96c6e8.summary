a multi-coloured footbridge has been built over a canal bed - and it 's made out of giant - sized pieces of @entity3			1
the six - ton steel bridge in the @entity6 area of @entity7 cost £ 90,000 to construct , using 400 pieces of oversized @entity9 and 700 nuts and bolts			1
it is hoped that the project will kickstart a regeneration of the historic stretch of the @entity16 , @entity7 and @entity17 at @entity18			1
the council praised its distinctiveness toy town : designer @entity25 with one of the 400 pieces of giant @entity3 used to build the bridge over the disused canal the bridge built at the spot in 1796 was a wooden construction used by horses , but it collapsed around 50 years ago			1
earlier this year , a developer gave @entity43 money for the building project , an agreement that was part of its planning application to build houses in @entity6			1
the council commissioned public artist @entity25 , from @entity52 , to work on a public installation			1
' we tried out a few smaller projects in the area , such as floating structures like a boat made of cds , created by local people , ' he told @entity61			2
' we then turned towards canal and had a different site , but the @entity16 , @entity7 and @entity64 talked me into looking at the site where the bridge now is			1
nuts and bolts : the fact that the pieces could be assembled on site meant lots of people could be involved ' distinctive ' : the nuts , bolts and component parts were made in two @entity7 factories play time ! a local steel fabricator made the beams , nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set - but 10 times thicker and 1,000 times heavier ' they thought having it there would allow them to develop the rest of the canal , and have a footpath going into @entity23			1
' @entity94 , leader of the society , took me on a tour of a vandalised bridge and a new , very robust but slightly ugly bridge nearby			1
it made me want to make the design stronger , and yet reflect @entity7 's heritage as town of engineering @entity9 is a model construction system comprising re-usable metal strips , plates , angle girders , wheels , axles and gears , with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces			1
it was invented in 1901 in @entity116 by @entity117 and manufactured by the @entity119 company , @entity3 , between 1908 and 1980			0
it was an educational toy for children , teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing			2
it is now manufactured in @entity125 and @entity126			0
' @entity3 is , in a sense , scaled down engineering and all we were doing was scaling it up			0
' it 's intriguing because of the @entity3 element , and it was funny going back to it - we even modelled it with @entity3			1
' we also had something we could assemble on site , meaning lots of people could be involved			0
' a @entity3 society came to visit it and they were impressed with its authenticity			0
' the completed bridge now stands 1.3 metres high and spans 6.4m across the canal in @entity6 to @entity23			0
here , the canal branches into three , at a famous site important to the history of canal building , dating back to the 1790s			0
local steel fabricators made the beams , nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set — but ten times thicker and 1,000 times heavier			1
each piece cost around £ 55 to produce and each bolt around £ 18			1
the bridge uses traditional 1950s @entity3 colours , and local people volunteered to help with the building			2
mr @entity25 added : ' building a bridge from giant @entity3 is the fulfilment of a childhood dream			1
i spent my entire childhood building mechanical devices from @entity9			0
' it was n’t until i actually saw the finished pieces arriving from the factory that i realised we had created something quite wonderful			0
' as members of the canal society unpacked the lorry , they appeared like lilliputian figures in a magical toy world			0
' i am so grateful to everyone involved			0
the engineers at @entity43 have been creative and inventive and given us something which is structurally sound without compromising the artwork			0
the local residents and canal society members have been working tirelessly			0
' public land : the project is being funded through an agreement with a developer as part of a planning application bright idea : the scaled - up building pieces make people ' look like lilliputian figures in a magical toy world ' , according to the artist the council ’s cabinet member for environment , councillor @entity198 , hailed it as a ‘ distinctive landmark ’			1
he said : ' being from the local area myself i know that the bridge will really benefit local people and i hope they make good use of it			0
' it was originally described as having an ' exaggerated toy - like detail '			2
@entity211 , @entity7 at @entity213 ’s east neighbourhood manager , said : ' local residents have been overwhelmingly supportive of this idea , which we believe would make a positive difference to the area as both a functional and decorative feature			2
' the canal society is also carrying out improvements around the @entity18 section of the canal and is planning to create a picnic area			0
society members hope it will form part of their long - term aspirations to create a visitor centre and re-open the waterway			2
they plan to remove the in - fill at the nearest road bridge and put in a dam so that water can flow down the stretch of canal again and under the @entity9 bridge			2
@entity237 begins on constructing the @entity9 bridge ...			0

builders used 700 oversized nuts and bolts , which cost £ 18 each
each component is ten times *bigger* and heavier than regular - sized ones
artist @entity25 said he wanted to reflect @entity7 's engineering heritage
two factories made the beams , nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set
money for the art project came from a developer building homes nearby
it gave the council money for the bridge as part of its planning *permission*
