for the majority of @entity2 's royals , an official car and a team made up of a squad of protection officers and at least one flunky are essential when carrying out official engagements			2
not so @entity11 's @entity10 @entity9 , who chose to walk from her home at the @entity13 to a meeting in @entity15 this morning			1
accompanied by a single bodyguard , the 42 - year - old royal arrived in a similarly low - key ensemble comprised of a pair of tailored trousers and a tailored red wool coat			1
low key : @entity11 's @entity10 @entity9 arrives on foot for the board meeting of @entity25 in @entity15 this morning @entity9 was attending the board meeting of @entity25 , the @entity27 of @entity28 - a body that has found itself called into action more often than usual of late , thanks to @entity11 's two @entity32 victims			1
despite the serious subject matter , the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left			2
the meeting with @entity25 is a bit of a departure for @entity9 who , until now , has focused her efforts on championing @entity11 culture and the plight of disabled people , although latterly , health has become something of a preoccupation			1
last week , she compered a meeting of the @entity50 , an organisation of which she is president			0
a day later and she was back on the cultural beat , joining husband @entity53 for the opening of a museum in @entity56			0
no car : the @entity11 royal , 42 , was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard concern : @entity9 has championed more health initiatives of late and was with a cancer charity last week during the couple 's tour of @entity68 , they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of @entity11 greats , among them @entity74			1
@entity9 's latest meeting comes shortly after the @entity11 royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king @entity80 has come forward			1
@entity81 , 47 , has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the @entity86 - if she can prove her story is true			0
according to ms @entity81 , she is the product of a three - night liaison between her mother @entity90 , a @entity91 governess , and the now 76 - year - old royal in 1966			0
although by then a married 28 - year - old father of two , an affair would hardly have been out of character for @entity80			0
feeling the cold ? @entity9 kept her tailored dark red wool jacket on throughout the meeting glamorous : she teamed her businesslike look with links of @entity102 ' @entity104 ' egg earrings throughout his marriage ' @entity105 ' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women , including an alleged affair with princess @entity109 while on a cruise with their spouses in august 1986			2
ms @entity81 herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years , only being told his name in 2011			0
although @entity11 courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests , @entity105 - @entity80 ' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt			0
looking cool : @entity9 donned a pair of stylish aviator sunglasses as she made her exit busy : the end of last week saw @entity130 travel to @entity56 for the opening of a new museum culture : the @entity11 royal has long been an enthusiastic champion of @entity11 culture and the arts interesting : she and @entity53 were shown a contemporary art exhibition that included works by @entity74			2
