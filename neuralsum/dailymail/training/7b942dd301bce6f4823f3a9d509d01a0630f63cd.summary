@entity1 governor - elect @entity0 disclosed on wednesday that his state , along with 16 others , had filed a lawsuit against president @entity5 and his administration over changes to the immigration system			1

@entity1 attorney general and gov. - elect @entity44 speaks against president @entity5 's executive actions on immigration last month in @entity47 , @entity1			1
@entity0 formally announced his state 's lawsuit against the president today over his immigration actions @entity1 ' current governor , @entity52 and @entity31 gov. @entity53 have been saying since the day the president announced his decision to defer deportation for nearly 5 million immigrants that their states would consider suing @entity5 , and @entity0 followed up @entity5 's proclamation with a threat of his own			1
' president @entity5 has circumvented @entity62 and deliberately bypassed the will of the @entity65 people , eroding the very foundation of our nation ’s constitution and bestowing a legacy of lawlessness , ' @entity0 said in a statement at the time			1
today he decried @entity5 for taking actions that ' directly violate the fundamental promise to the @entity65 people ' to abide by the @entity12			2
' the ability of the president to dispense with laws was specifically considered and unanimously rejected at the @entity80 , ' @entity0 stated , according to @entity81			0
the legal arguments laid out in the suit are the violation of @entity85 of the @entity12 , which states that the president ' shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed			0
it also claims that at shift in federal policy will ' exacerbate the humanitarian crisis along the southern border , which will affect increased state investment in law enforcement , health care and education			0
' outgoing @entity1 gov. @entity52 said at a conference last month that it costs his state roughly $ 12 million to defend the @entity65 border with @entity102 , which overlaps substantially with the @entity1 border			0
at a presser today separate from @entity0 's , @entity52 said , ' in effect , [ @entity5 's ] action placed a neon sign on our border , assuring people that they could ignore the law of the @entity65			2
' today 's announcement to sue over the issue was not unexpected as @entity0 had said on monday that the lawsuit would formally be filed ' any day now			1
' ' we are dotting the i ’s and crossing the t ’s , ' he said on @entity119 with @entity120			0

' while the president or his attorneys may have the discretion whether or not to prosecute someone , they do n’t have the authority to give rights to people they are not prosecuting and put burdens on other agencies to carry out all these orders so this is , as you know , far from prosecutorial discretion , ' he said			0
insisting that the lawsuit is not about his ideological opposition to the @entity154 president , @entity0 said monday , ' i think it ’s extremely important to emphasize that i am addressing this as a legal issue , not a political issue			2
' the president has crossed the line from politics to endangering the constitutional structure , ' the @entity37 politician said , per the @entity165			0
@entity0 has already sued @entity5 30 times before today while serving as attorney general of the @entity1 , with the new lawsuit making 31 times			1
on friday he 'll have the distinct honor of meeting the very man he 's sued so often at the @entity41 in @entity171 he 'll join a handful of other recently elected governors there for a meeting on the economy			1
