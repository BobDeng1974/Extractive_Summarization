by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 04:41 est , 16 december 2013 @entity3 : 04:53 est , 16 december 2013 people who live near airports should pay less tax for ‘ tolerating ’ high levels of noise , a new report suggests			1
the @entity10 argues that the area around runways could become ‘ tax havens ’ for local residents with public services paid for through taxes on airport operators			1
the radical idea emerged ahead of tomorrow ’s publication of an interim report by sir @entity21 into airport expansion in the @entity23 noise : people who live near airports should pay less tax as compensation for the disruption caused by flights , the @entity10 said the @entity10 says there must be a ‘ more decentralised tax system ’ which would ensure that revenue ‘ generated at and around an airport stays in the local area ’ instead of being taken by the @entity35			1
the report adds : ‘ the surroundings of large airports could then become “ tax havens ” : airports would account for a large share of the local tax revenue , so residents could enjoy both low taxes and excellent local public services / infrastructure			1
‘ @entity46 can not be meaningfully separated from fiscal autonomy at the local level			2
the local level should have the right to keep most of the locally generated tax revenue			1
‘ but the logical correlate of that right is that areas which permit a high level of economic activity are no longer obliged to share their revenue with areas that do not			0
‘ in a decentralised system , the vicinities of airports would become ‘ tax havens ’			2
it is often claimed that high tax rates are the necessary price to pay for high - quality infrastructure and public services , because there is no way to combine ‘ @entity71 social services with @entity73 tax rates ’			0
sir @entity21 , who is running a commission into airport expansion for the government ‘ that claim is wrong			1
in a localised system , areas with sufficiently high levels of airport activity could achieve precisely that			2
there is no free lunch , but residents in those areas would ‘ pay ’ by tolerating high noise levels			2
that is a near - market solution for economic progress that benefits all sides			0
’ the @entity90 is expected to say that new runways are @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 should all be considered			0
but an increase in flights will be viciously opposed by people living nearby			0
before the last election the @entity98 vowed not to expand @entity92 , with @entity100 , now the international development secretary , leading a campaign against a third runway			0
@entity105 mayor @entity104 is also opposed to the idea of expanding @entity92 , warning it would be ‘ environmentally disastrous and wrong for the country ’			0
but some senior conservatives now believe it is the only realistic option to provide the extra capacity needed to attract investment in the @entity113			0
the @entity10 argues that those in favour of airport expansion also need to make the case for allowing more families to go on holiday			1
‘ supporters of airport expansion should stop hiding behind an instrumental defence of aviation , and openly make the case for air travel as a leisure industry , its report adds			1
‘ they should confront the mindset of ‘ malthusian miserabilism ’ which characterises modern environmentalism			2
‘ environmentalists have become the latter - day heirs of the @entity132 , who opposed railway travel on the grounds that it would “ only encourage the lower classes to move about needlessly ”			0

@entity139 says local residents should be compensated
money generated in and around airports should stay in the local area
attacks green ' miserabilism ' against allowing families to go on holiday
comes ahead of interim report into airport expansion in the @entity23
