@entity1 's soccer team has a must - watch @entity3 match against @entity4 kicking off at noon on thursday and coach @entity5 has given everyone permission to take the day off			1
the @entity8 coach sent out an absence note on wednesday via social media for supporters - with understanding bosses - to excuse them for the day , and reminded those willing not to forget to ' wear your jersey '			1
the best excuse for staying at home , @entity5 believes , is because the team ' will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round '			1
' i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace , but i can assure you that it is for an important cause			0
' the # @entity42 has a critical @entity3 game vs. @entity4 and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round			1
' by the way , you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well			0
go @entity8 ! ' when @entity51 stands for the national anthems of his countries on thursday , he will soak in the moment			2
@entity51 , like four @entity1 teammates and his coach , will be familiar with both @entity57 and the @entity58 before the @entity1 ' @entity3 game against @entity4			1
after playing three games in 2008 for the nation in which he grew up , @entity51 switched allegiance to the @entity1 two years later			1
' when i hear the anthem from the @entity1 , i will close my eyes and let everything go through , ' the tenacious midfielder said			2
and then comes the big game			0
four years of work by the @entity1 come down to 90 or so minutes in the afternoon heat and possibly rain at @entity71 on the outskirts of a sprawling beach city known as the @entity75 @entity74			0
now you see stars ! the back page of @entity80 daily @entity79 anticipates @entity5 and his @entity8 team will be handed a beating against @entity4 having squandered the chance to clinch advancement earlier this week against @entity85 by allowing a stoppage - time goal in a 2 - 2 draw , the @entity1 might need at least a tie against the three - time champions to reach the knockout stage of consecutive @entity3 for the first time			1
the story lines are gripping : mission : @entity5 in training with his @entity8 squad ahead of their @entity96 showdown for top spot the @entity80 beat @entity85 4 - 0 and tied @entity99 2 - 2 , leaving them with four points and a plus - four goal difference			1
the @entity1 , who defeated @entity99 2 - 1 , have four points and a plus - one goal difference			1
@entity99 and @entity85 , with one point each , play simultaneously in @entity104 , knowing a tie in either game would eliminate both of them			1
@entity8 officials will have a system to relay the score of the other match to the bench			2
' to be able to keep that level of interest for another four , five , six and hopefully more days would be great for the sport , ' @entity8 president @entity114 said			0
' i think for the first time in our history - recent history , i 'm not going to talk about 1950 or before - our players believe they 're capable of beating anyone			2
' he rejects the notion the dual nationals are any less @entity1 than those who came up through the @entity1 youth system			0
preparation : @entity8 can top the group but have to beat @entity4 to do so due to their superior goal difference when the @entity1 and @entity4 met for the first time in the group stage of the @entity134 , @entity5 scored the second goal in a 2 - 0 win			1
the teams played four years later in the quarterfinals , when @entity140 's 39th - minute goal gave the @entity80 a 1 - 0 victory			1
the @entity1 still complain @entity143 referee @entity142 declined to call a penalty kick when @entity146 's 49th - minute shot hit the left arm of defender @entity148 at the goal line			2
while the @entity80 have four off days between matches , the @entity1 has only three			2
and teams are 0 - 4 after games in the steamy @entity154 rainforest capital of @entity155 , where the @entity1 played sunday night			1
' it 's the biggest game of all of our lives , ' @entity156 said			0
' any fatigue in our legs will be erased			0
we 've got to give it everything we 've got and more			0
' all but through : @entity8 know a draw would be enough to see them through for definite there is an outside chance the @entity1 and @entity85 could tie for second with four points and be even on all tiebreakers - for instance , if the @entity1 lose 3 - 0 and the @entity173 win 2 - 0			1
in that case , a drawing of lots would decide which team advances			0
the teams that move on will have second - round matchups with @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 or @entity184			2
@entity114 hopes for more , much more , that will help boost the growing @entity1 fan base			0
' it 's pretty easy to get emotional about , ' he said , ' wanting to see this day happen			0
that day is still to come			0
and that day has got a trophy involved			0
