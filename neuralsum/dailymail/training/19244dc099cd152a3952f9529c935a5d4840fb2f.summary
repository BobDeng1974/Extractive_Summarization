what 's more annoying than when you 've preened and groomed , ready to pose for that perfect portrait ... only to have it photobombed by an idiot ? no wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken			1
the bird of prey looked wide - eyed and open - mouthed at the insect as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in @entity17 , @entity18 , looking angrier by the second			1
refusing to have his moment in the spotlight ruined , the hawk then tried to eat the wasp , but it danced about his snapping beak before flying away to safety			1
wasp are you doing ? no wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken buzz off ! the bird of prey looked wide - eyed and open - mouthed at the insect as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in @entity17 , @entity18 , looking angrier by the second @entity38 , 22 , captured the image of the @entity41 's hawk looking startled as the yellow and black striped insect buzzed in front of him in @entity17			1
the student , from @entity47 , @entity18 , took her first photo at the age of 13 and could n't believe her eyes when the hawk was photobombed			1
@entity38 , who also works as an animal caretaker , said : ' the @entity41 's hawk in the photo is actually an imprint falconry that was raised by a falconer			2
' in the photo , he is just over two months old , and due to his human - reared upbringing , talks , chirps , and screams his thoughts constantly			0
' what made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak			2
good shot : @entity38 , 22 , captured the image of the @entity41 's hawk looking startled as the yellow and black striped insect buzzed in front of him in @entity17 lucky : keen animal photographer @entity38 almost deleted the snap but was left in stitches after spotting it while scrolling through her camera 's memory card ' if you look closer , you 'll notice that at the moment of the photo , only one eye is actually focused on the wasp			1
' the other is still in the direction he was looking a fraction of a second earlier			0
' the sequence of photos before and after shows his scream start , freeze , start again , and then end as he tries to eat the wasp - it was incredible			2

snap : refusing to have his moment in the spotlight ruined , the hawk then tried to eat the wasp , but it danced about his snapping beak before flying away to safety fantastic : she said , ' what made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak ' she said : ' i did not realise i had managed to capture such a rare moment on film until i ran through the photos later that evening			1
' i knew there had been a wasp buzzing around while i was out with the camera , but i told myself it was probably well out of focus and a lost chance anyway			0
' the wasp was only there for a span of perhaps two seconds			0
' i was tapping the next arrow repeatedly through the photos desperately trying to find one that highlighted the excellent lighting over his feathers , and deleting the ones that looked even slightly off in the same motion			0
' i remember tapping past this one , getting maybe three or four past it , pausing , and tapping back slowly			0
' i laughed harder in that moment than i had all week			0
' that instant reaction of hilarity is why i love this photo and from what i 've heard and seen , it seems to be a pretty universal reaction			0

picture was taken by student @entity38 , 22 , in @entity17 , @entity18
just as the bird lets out a *squawk* for the picture , wasp buzzes into frame
the hawk stares open - mouthed at insect before trying to eat it whole
but the pesky wasp dances around his head before flying away *unharmed*
