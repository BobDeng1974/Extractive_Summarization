by @entity0 life was looking up for 18 - year - old @entity2 as he saw in the @entity3 with his friends			1
the handsome teen had been in remission with leukaemia for six months and had just two bouts of chemotherapy left to go			1
he was looking forward to playing rugby and hockey again , had passed his driving test and was proving popular with girls			2
the apprentice mechanic also had plans to work in @entity16			2
but all that came to a stop just four days later when a doctor wrongly ordered that the powerful chemotherapy drug , vincristine , should be injected into @entity2 's spine instead of a vein			1
this mistake by dr @entity25 cost @entity2 his life			2
it slowly destroyed his spinal cord and nerves , killing him a month later			2
a doctor wrongly ordered that the powerful chemotherapy drug , vincristine , should be injected into 18 - year - old @entity2 's spine instead of a vein - costing @entity2 his life his father and mother could only watch helplessly			1
at one point , @entity2 was in such pain he begged for mercy			2
' in the final minutes before he lost consciousness , @entity2 looked up at me as i held him in my arms , ' says his mother @entity42			2
' he cried : “ mum , what have they done to me ? am i dying ? ” ' @entity2 died a few days before his 19th birthday			2
nearly 13 years later , @entity42 , 53 , weeps as she recalls his final days			2
dr @entity25 pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for eight months			2
between 1975 and 2001 , 14 patients died after the same fatal chemotherapy error			2
in 2001 , an official inquiry made 50 recommendations to prevent similar tragedies			2
led by professor @entity53 , emeritus professor of patient safety at @entity55 , the inquiry called for separate storage areas for spinal and intravenous drugs , and different times for dispensing them			2
all but one of the recommendations have been put in place			1
but alarmingly , a similar tragedy could still easily happen again , warns professor @entity53			2
it 's down to the health service dragging its feet over changing its reliance on a simple plastic device , known as a @entity71 connector			1
luer connectors attach syringes , catheters and needles into drips in a patient 's vein , spine , muscle or skin this small tube - like connector is the standard means of attaching syringes , catheters and needles into drips in a patient 's vein , spine , muscle or under their skin			1
the universal , fit - all connectors have been used in hospitals since they were designed in 1896			1
they are part of 700,000 spinal and epidural procedures each year , as well as countless intravenous drips			1
thanks to the implementation of 49 of professor @entity53 's recommendations , there have been no more fatal chemotherapy errors in @entity102 since @entity2 's death			2
however , there have been deaths due to other drugs being administered via the wrong route , says professor @entity53			2
in 2004 , @entity108 , a 30 - year - old theatre nurse , suffered a fatal heart attack an hour after giving birth to her son @entity111 at the @entity112 in @entity113 , where she worked			1
instead of a saline solution to help her blood pressure , the powerful anaesthetic bupivacaine was administered via an intravenous drip ( this drug should not be given in this way )			2
the hospital was fined £ 100,000			0
to prevent these wrong route errors , in 2009 the health watchdog the @entity122 advised the @entity123 to switch to safer non-luer connectors ( @entity125 )			1
developed and invented in @entity102 , these cost the same as the old devices , but their special lock design means medicines intended to be injected into a vein ca n't be put into the spine and vice versa			1
' it is the equivalent to stopping you putting diesel in a petrol car - except we are talking about human life , ' says professor @entity53 , who is chairman of the @entity143 reference group for safer neuraxial ( spinal ) devices			1
the @entity123 set a target date of april 2012 for all hospitals to get the new connectors , yet figures show just 70 trusts in @entity143 are using them - 90 still do not			1
not a single trust in @entity153 , @entity154 or @entity155 uses them			0
' we are the world leader in this new equipment , but the trusts say they are waiting until the @entity162 - based @entity161 publishes its seal of approval for a @entity166 connector , but that could take years , ' says professor @entity53			1
' yet the safer connector could be used in every hospital today			1
the delay in bringing in a simple life - saving solution is frustrating			1
' in just one year in @entity143 and @entity153 , there were 19 reports of wrong route errors			0
professor @entity53 warns : ' the @entity123 could be sued for clinical negligence if a patient dies and a trust has not used an @entity125			1
@entity177 with @entity178 , mother of @entity2 who died on january 4 ' there is a need for action before another @entity2 tragedy happens			0
' behind professor @entity53 's 11 - year campaign to improve safety in this area is a pledge he made to @entity2 's father , also called @entity2 , and @entity42			1
' they are a lovely family and what their son went through was heart - rending			1
i promised them i would do my utmost to ensure another person would not die like him			0
' @entity2 first became ill in the summer of 1999 , coming home early from a night out because he was feeling shattered			0
' he slept most of the weekend and on monday , when he could n't lift his head off the pillow , we called the gp , ' says @entity42 , who lives in @entity204 , @entity205			1
' he took one look at him , did a blood test and said : “ get him to the hospital now			0
” ' his father recalls the day they found out @entity2 had leukaemia			0
' i told him he had cancer , but it was treatable			0
he cried , but when he asked “ am i going to get through this , @entity217 ? ” , i said : “ of course you are ” and gave him a cuddle , ' says @entity221 , 54			0
' somehow we coped with each stage of treatment			0
he never complained - he was a lovely lad			1
' for @entity2 's penultimate chemo - therapy session , he was due to be given two anti-cancer drugs : cytosine , to be injected into the spine that day , january 4 , 2001 ; and vincristine , injected into a vein the next day			1
but after just two days working at @entity232 in @entity233 , registrar dr @entity25 did n't read the warnings on the syringe of vincristine that stated it was for intravenous ( into the vein ) use only			1
nor did he look at @entity2 's medical records			0
instead , he ordered a junior doctor to put both drugs into @entity2 's spine			1
the junior asked him twice if this was correct , a nurse also challenged him and even @entity2 quizzed him about it as he 'd had these treatments before			0
despite this , dr @entity25 ordered the junior doctor to go ahead			0
only after this had been done did he read the drugs chart			0
staff in the intensive care unit tried desperately to flush out the drug , injecting fluids into the top of @entity2 's spine and placing a drain at the bottom , but it did n't work			1
' the vincristine sent his whole body into agonising cramps and he was screaming in pain , ' says his father			0
' about six staff were holding him down in bed as he was trying to get out of it , begging us to help him			0
' i pleaded with them to give him something , but they said they could n't as they would not be able to assess how bad the situation was			1
i held him firmly while trying to reassure him he would be ok			0
' @entity2 's parents were then called into the intensive care consultant 's office , where he told them bluntly that their son was going to die			0
' he told us a pinprick of the drug is enough to paralyse you - @entity2 had the full quota			1
it clings to the muscles and ca n't be flushed out			1
he said @entity2 had no chance , ' says his father			0
@entity2 ( left ) aged 16 with his brother @entity286 aged 14 within the next few days , their son lost all feeling in his legs and was paralysed from the waist down			0
as @entity2 was 18 , the medics said he had to be told he was dying			0
his father was against this , but @entity42 decided she owed it to her son to be honest			0
' we believe he would have got over the cancer and i felt he had a right to know what the hospital had done to him , ' she says			0
as he lapsed into a coma , she told him : ' i am so sorry , but they have poisoned you			0
' @entity2 's final words were : ' get the b * * * * * * s for me , @entity307			0
' after he lost consciousness , his parents maintained a 24 - hour vigil , reassuring him , playing his favourite @entity312 tracks and telling him how much they loved him			1
eventually , they agreed that his life - support machine should be turned off			1
@entity2 died on february 2 as his parents clasped his hands			0
' i would not want anyone , parent or child , to go through what we experienced , ' says his father			0
last month , professor @entity53 met mp @entity322 , chairman of the @entity323 , and wrote to health secretary @entity324 and other leading health chiefs , informing them there was an unacceptable delay in getting all trusts to use @entity166 connectors			1
' mr @entity322 told me the chief inspector for @entity332 , sir @entity331 , will insist hospitals introduce them as each is inspected			0
' indeed , yesterday the @entity336 learned that hospitals are being given a third warning that they should be using @entity125 , with a timetable of three months			0
after years of delay , professor @entity53 believes that now there will be a massive improvement in the take - up rate			1
if not , enforcement notices can be issued			0
' i welcome the @entity336 's endeavours to bring this situation to the public 's attention			0
it has shone a light on an area that badly needs it , ' he says			0
' and i feel more hopeful that i can keep my promise to @entity2 's parents			0

@entity71 connector is the standard means of attaching syringes into drips
@entity122 advised @entity123 to switch to @entity166 in 2009
special lock means medicines for vein ca n't be put in spine
just 70 @entity369 trusts use them - 90 still do not , despite april 2012 target
