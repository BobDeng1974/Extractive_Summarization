by @entity0 public trust in the police has been severely shaken by recent corruption scandals , a major report warned yesterday			1
in a worrying assessment , @entity5 ’s chief inspector of constabulary @entity6 said the public felt badly let down by the failure of officers to live up to expected standards of integrity			2
the @entity25 investigation , @entity15 , @entity16 , revelations about undercover officers , the death of @entity20 during the @entity22 riots and other recent controversies have , he said , left the police damaged – despite ordinary bobbies being more honest than they were in the 1960s and 1970s			1
her majesty 's chief inspector of constabulary @entity6 said the public felt badly let down by the failure of officers to live up to expected standards of integrity			2
file picture in his 163 - page assessment of the @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 , mr @entity6 concludes forces are : but it is his conclusions around public trust in the police which will raise the most concern			1
he wrote : ‘ controversies and revelations of a serious and negative nature in relation to the conduct of some police officers , both past and present , have hurt public confidence in the police , and the morale of the very great majority of honest , hardworking , committed and brave police officers has suffered as a consequence			1
’ @entity56 : victim of misconduct in @entity16 row he added : ‘ the police service has been damaged , but it is certainly not broken			0
’ mr @entity6 called on police leaders to ‘ repair the damage which has been done ’ with a commitment to the highest standards of professional conduct and to the vigorous and uncompromising establishment of the truth			0
those who have violated the high standards that police officers should abide by deserve firm treatment , the report said			0
it said : ‘ [ the public ’s ] expectations are that police officers will adhere to standards of honesty and conduct which are appreciably higher than those demanded of most others			2
and it is in that respect that the public feel badly let down – and perhaps afraid – when police officers are exposed as having failed			0
’ before he was appointed to head the @entity85 , mr @entity6 wrote two reports proposing widespread and radical reforms of the police			0
until then , policing workplace practices were ‘ stale and discredited ’ and some officers developed a sense that forces ‘ deserved to be insulated from fundamental and searching review ’ , he concluded			0
the failure properly to combat the huge rise in cybercrime had handed the advantage to offenders and left the public at risk			0
‘ the internet opens a new portal in our homes to those who do us harm , ’ he said			0
mr @entity6 pointed to burglary detection rates among forces as low as 15 per cent and also raised ‘ real concerns ’ about the handling of domestic abuse cases and car crime			1
and , he said , criminals have got off as a result of the sloppy writing of reports for the @entity117			0
controversies such as the @entity25 ( left ) investigation and the death of @entity20 during the @entity22 riots ( right ) have affected public trust labour policing spokesman @entity123 said the report raised serious questions about the future of @entity128 policing			1
‘ public trust in the police has been damaged by allegations of misconduct , failed investigations and cover - ups , ’ mr @entity123 said			1
a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 ’s report rightly points out that recent allegations about misconduct have damaged but not broken public confidence in the police			2
the majority of police officers conduct themselves honestly			1

@entity25 , @entity15 , and other controversies shake public trust
failures over break - ins , domestic abuse and cyber crime also worry public
but @entity136 says majority of officers conduct themselves properly
failing properly to investigate home break - ins , domestic abuse and car crime ;
ill - prepared and ill - *equipped* to deal with new types of crime such as *online* fraud ;
leaving officers with *primitive* *technology* more than a *decade* old ;
mired in *inefficiency* and *unnecessary* *bureaucracy* .
