spam text messaging is also on the increase , particularly messages about debt management and accident claims			1
industry figures show 30million @entity33 receive up to a billion nuisance phone and text messages a year			1
but as the law stands , the @entity36 must prove a company caused ‘ substantial harm or substantial distress ’ by their conduct before it can act			0

surge : industry figures show 30million @entity33 receive up to a billion nuisance phone and text messages a year mr @entity0 said he now planned to change the law after a rapid six - week government consultation , to be announced today			1
the law could be changed within 12 weeks of the end of the consultation			0

i want to make it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we do n’t want			0
’ anyone who wants to stop receiving nuisance calls can submit their details to the @entity73 ( @entity105 )			2
companies are legally obliged not to make unsolicited marketing calls to numbers listed on the register , and they must screen their data against it			0

@entity136 , executive director of consumer group which ? and chair of the government 's taskforce on marketing consent , said : ‘ changing the rules so it 's easier for regulators to punish the companies making nuisance calls is a big step forward and a victory for the 125,000 people who supported our campaign on the issue			2
‘ millions of us endure unwanted calls and texts every day so these new powers must be introduced as soon as possible			2
we look forward to the regulators using them to crack down hard on the unscrupulous firms that flout the rules			0

information commissioner @entity163 said : ' the public clearly want to see a stop to nuisance calls and texts			2
' we welcome this proposed change in the law which will enable the @entity36 to make more fines stick , sending a clear message to the spammers and scammers that the rules around cold calls and spam texts must be followed			2
' the majority of rogue marketing firms make hundreds , rather than thousands , of calls and the nuisance is no less a nuisance for falling short of the ‘ substantial ’ threshold			1
' this change means we could now target those many companies sending unwanted messages – and we think consumers would see a definite drop off in the total number of spam calls and texts			1

threshold of what is considered a spam call or text will be lowered
watchdogs will be given powers to fine firms *responsible* up to £ 500,000
