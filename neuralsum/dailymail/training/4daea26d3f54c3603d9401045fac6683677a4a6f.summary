she was left unable to have children after suffering from appendicitis as a child national guidelines suggest that women should be eligible for ivf from the age of 23 , but this is not an obligation and each trust is free to impose its own restrictions , creating a postcode lottery			1
the couple , who married three years ago , say they are the victims of age discrimination and that delaying treatment could reduce their chances of conceiving			2
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ it is bad enough not to be able to have children naturally , but this is like someone is saying , “ no , you ca n’t have children – you have got to wait ”			1

@entity4 must wait until she **'s** 30 to qualify for a free round of treatment
her lawyer says @entity118 **'s** *decision* is ' *unreasonable* , *unlawful* and *unfair* '
postcode lottery means trusts can pick their own ivf criteria and do *n't* have to follow national guidelines
