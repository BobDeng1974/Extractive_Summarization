by @entity0 @entity2 champion swimmer @entity1 understands the undesirable side of fame , having been subjected to endless abuse about the way she looks if anyone understands the undesirable side of fame , it is swimmer @entity1			1
she might be a four - time @entity2 medallist but , for as long as she has been feted for her sporting achievements , she has also been subject to endless abuse over the way she looks			1
one comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin , while @entity17 trolls attacked her about her weight , her nose and for simply not being pretty enough			1
for a girl who has admitted to hating her appearance it must have been devastating			2
worse , when it became apparent earlier this year that @entity1 had undergone surgery to have her nose reduced and bump removed , it became a national talking point as to whether she should or should n’t have given in to the cyber bullies			1
little wonder she ’s so far refused to confirm or deny the reports she did indeed undergo surgery			1
sitting opposite her , there ’s no doubt that @entity1 , 25 , looks different : leaner , more polished and , yes , with a more streamlined nose			1
and it ’s not just outwardly she has changed			2
@entity1 , who retired from competitive swimming after the @entity35 , has also developed a greater inner confidence			1
speaking for the first time about ‘ the nose job ’ , @entity1 is emphatic in insisting that it is nobody ’s business but her own			1
‘ if somebody else wants to know [ that ] , well tough luck , ’ she says with a toss of her long blonde hair			2
‘ it ’s my life			1
loads of women have loads of things that they do – like a @entity50 or whatever – but i just think if you open yourself up in that way , there ’s a lot more that happens			2
‘ i ’ve never opened the door in that way			0
i never set out to be in the spotlight			0
i ’ve fallen into it by doing something that i love , that is my passion			0
’ having this attitude meant that when the online attacks began , it was all the harder to bear			0
the youngest of @entity67 businessman @entity66 and his wife @entity68 ’s three daughters , @entity1 had no idea of the shocking vitriol that would be levelled at her after she won two gold medals at the @entity73 in 2008			1
@entity1 explains : ‘ obviously , being a swimmer , you never think you ’re going to get any sort of profile , so i did n’t know what fame was			1
i did n’t expect it			0
' the thing that i found very difficult when it all started happening after @entity82 was that people were commenting on something that i just did n’t understand – on the way i look – and i thought , “ what ’s that got to do with swimming ? ” so that hit me			1
‘ i also thought , well i ’m trying to represent my country and you should be wanting to help everyone – all the @entity93 team get behind each other			0
' at first it definitely upset me			0
i ’d burst into tears when i first started reading things but as i ’ve grown up i ’ve learnt to think , you know what , i do n’t know them , they ’ve never seen me in real life , they ’ve never spoken to me			1
' at first it definitely upset me			0
i 'd burst into tears when i first started reading things but as i 've grown up i 've learnt to think , you know what , i do n't know them , they 've never seen me in real life ' ‘ you ’ve got to be a certain kind of person to sit there , make the effort to find somebody , to write them a nasty message			1
you know what ? just block them out of your mind			0
’ in reality , it ’s not as simple as all that			0
the path of a young and newly retired athlete is not always easy but @entity1 is now carving out a successful tv career			1
during her appearance on i ’m a celebrity ... @entity129 , she regularly broke down in tears after comparing herself unfavourably to fellow contestant @entity131 , a beauty queen of not inconsiderable assets			1
but @entity1 is now on the panel of @entity136 ’s chatshow @entity134 – where she is sparky and forthright – and will also soon appear on through @entity137			1
she and her fiance , @entity138 , a professional swimmer three years her junior ( he used to have her poster on his wall ) , are getting married in august			1
they have a comfortable home in @entity144 , @entity145 , and want to have children one day			0
life is good yet @entity1 admits that on occasions she ca n’t resist looking at @entity17			1
before and after : @entity1 pictured left , before her plastic surgery , and right , showing off the results of the op ‘ i sit there at eight o’clock at night and @entity138 ’s saying , “ @entity154 , why are you checking @entity17 ? you ’re allowing them into our home			1
” ‘ i ’d never thought of it that way			0
you ’re sat there in your home , which is your comfort zone , and yet you ’re reading comments from other people and allowing them in			1
i thought yes , you ’re right			0
why am i doing this ? i ’ve tried to stop it now ... although i do it if @entity138 ’s out			0
’ the nastiness has died down but , according to @entity1 , that does n’t necessarily mean the @entity171 has changed			1
‘ it ’s only because i ’ve blocked them all [ the trolls ] , ’ she says with a hearty laugh			2
‘ i must have blocked about 4,000 people			2
i actually googled it the other day to see if there ’s any way i can find out how many people i ’ve done it to			1
‘ maybe it ’s not 4,000 , but i must have blocked at least 2,000 people			2
in a day i ’ve blocked 100 , 200 people , if something ’s happened			2
but to be fair it ’s calmed down a lot			0
’ ' i 'm definitely happier with how i look now ... but i would n't necessarily say happy			2
i think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror ' still , she ’s obviously taken the bullying to heart			0
@entity1 recently launched a campaign , run by @entity196 , to find out what advice the nation would give to their younger selves to make their lives better			1
she says she would tell her teenage self not to let strangers affect the way she feels about herself			0
in the flesh , the swimmer looks much prettier ... and it ’s not just because of the smoother nose			1
yet she still struggles with her insecurities			0
‘ i ’m definitely happier with how i look now , ’ she says			2
‘ but i would n’t necessarily say happy			0
i think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror			0
a lot of people tell me that you get more comfortable with yourself with age and obviously i ’ve still got a lot of growing up to do			2
‘ but i will never have this figure that ’s big - boobed and tiny waist and curvaceous bum			2
i know i have got slightly bigger shoulders than some people and an average cup size , that ’s not going to change			2
’ when she was swimming @entity1 needed to consume up to 3,500 calories a day			1
she would eat six @entity225 for breakfast , four sandwiches for lunch , a huge spaghetti bolognese in the evenings as well as constantly snacking			0
when she stopped swimming , perhaps inevitably , the weight piled on			2
@entity1 added : ' you do get down but now i ¿ ve learnt only to listen to the people i know , whose opinion i value ' the former athlete lost most of the weight when she was on i ’m a celebrity and has n’t put anything back on since			1
she reveals the only diet she does is the @entity241 five - day juice diet , which seems pretty extreme , but she insists she has a healthy attitude to food			1
i have a glass of wine with a meal now i ’ve retired although i ’ve only just started getting into it			0
i like white wine but i ca n’t get into red			0
i ’m not there yet			0
my mum keeps saying to me , “ trust me , it will come			0
” ' at the @entity35 , @entity1 won two bronze medals , making her @entity93 ’s most decorated female @entity256 alongside the rower @entity258 , but she admits she grew to dread race days			1
@entity1 says : ‘ i hated waking up and feeling so sick with nerves , it was unbelievable			1
' and that whole four - hour period or whatever it was leading up to a race where you literally ca n’t eat anything and your emotions are going crazy because you ’re so nervous			2
‘ in most other sports you have your season with lots of big competitions			0
like footballers who have a match every weekend			0
' we only competed twice a year			0
it was very difficult going into a race that you ’ve trained 90 per cent of the year for that lasted four minutes			0
all of that for a four - minute race			2
' that ’s what i found difficult			0
afterwards , you feel so frazzled , it ’s like someone ’s just electrocuted your brain			0
’ by comparison she loves her new career on tv , and loves appearing on @entity134			0
‘ i really enjoy it			0
and i ’m pretty all right at holding my own , ’ she says			2
‘ for a long time it [ the @entity17 abuse ] was something i found difficult to deal with			1
‘ you do get down but now i ’ve learnt only to listen to the people i know , whose opinion i value			1

one comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin while @entity17 trolls attacker her about her weight , her nose and for not being ' pretty enough '
she is said to have had surgery to her nose reduced and a bump removed
@entity1 said at first she would burst into tears reading the abuse
she said : ' i am definitely happier with how i look now '
