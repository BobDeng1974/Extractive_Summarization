@entity22 ’s team could now face an intriguing all - @entity24 last four encounter with @entity25 at @entity6 ’s headquarters in @entity27 , @entity28 , if @entity30 ’s young charges win away to @entity31 next week			1
@entity11 ( left , next @entity32 ) was among the crowd to watch @entity34 take on @entity7 @entity35 keeps posession under pressure from @entity7 's @entity38 @entity40 ( right ) and @entity41 tussle for the ball in midfield during the game on tuesday @entity40 ca n't manage to nip the ball away from @entity38 in a niggly exchange at @entity9 @entity3 @entity47 : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity35 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity2 subs : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 goals : @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity2 @entity68 : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity38 , @entity66 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity41 , @entity75 subs : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 goals : @entity85 after a tight opening half , the @entity86 finally broke the resistance of their @entity90 opponents after 38 minutes when defender @entity91 could only guide @entity56 ’s effort into the net			1
they then mounted a @entity95 rearguard action to keep their opponents at bay through the second period before @entity2 struck on the counter-attack to settle it two minutes from time			2
@entity7 had eliminated @entity101 in the previous round and arrived in sunny @entity103 seeking to pile the misery on another @entity24 opponent			0
@entity22 was taking no chances , fielding a full - strength team containing @entity56 and @entity2 , both tipped by @entity111 for bright futures , the talented @entity107 @entity40 and @entity108 under - 19 star @entity54			1
@entity54 ( left ) finds himself shielding the ball from @entity73 after a quiet start in which both teams tested one another out , @entity3 had the first chance on 25 minutes when @entity40 sent a free - kick spiralling over @entity119 ’s crossbar			1
just when it appeared the opening 45 would end without score , @entity56 broke free down the left channel and outpaced the @entity7 defence			0
@entity54 found him with the ideal through ball and @entity56 directed it past the goalkeeper			0
with @entity35 charging in to make sure , the under - pressure @entity91 got an unfortunate final touch to help it in			2
@entity56 will certainly want to claim the goal , his third goal of this season ’s @entity133 campaign			0
@entity7 were much improved after the break , dictating the tempo and starting the create opening			0
@entity72 , who scored the last 16 winner against @entity101 , fired in a near post effort that @entity48 diverted around the post			0
@entity74 ( left ) wins a header for the @entity90 side , while @entity2 rose highest ( right ) shortly afterwards , @entity80 sent a bouncing shot narrowly wide as @entity3 ’s goal came under threat			1
but their defence refused to be breached and , in classic @entity3 style , they grabbed a second on the break in the dying moments			2
@entity35 , playing in midfield rather than his normal defensive position , showed his creative instincts with a fine pass to @entity2 and the @entity108 under 18 international applied the finish			2
remarkably , it is his ninth goal in the @entity6 this season			0
@entity3 are the first to book their place in the semi-finals , which take place across the road from @entity6 ’s headquarters in @entity27 on april 10			0
the final will be staged at the same venue three days later			0
