by @entity0 @entity1 stands on the brink of greatness			1
@entity5 ’s favourite son will begin the final test of the series against @entity8 at @entity9 on friday needing eight more scalps to become @entity12 ’s leading wicket taker of all - time			1
the man the 32 - year - old is aiming to overtake ? only sir @entity15			1
already @entity12 ’s leading international wicket taker in all formats with 649 — of which 376 have come in @entity18 — @entity1 has morphed from a tearaway young fast bowler , whose early career performances veered from the sublime to the ordinary , into one of the most consistent swing bowlers of all - time			1
‘ @entity39 was always extremely competitive , ’ said his dad , @entity38			1
‘ i would n’t say he had a win - at - all - costs approach but he was extremely competitive , yes			1
we ’ve all played a lot of sport			1
‘ even at the age of 10 or 11 , if i beat him at golf would n’t speak to me for a couple of days after that			2
when he was around 15 or 16 he grew between six and nine inches in a year , put on a couple of yards of pace over the winter and had a few lads hopping around in the nets			2
‘ i remember batting against him in the nets around that time and one day deciding “ i do n’t think i fancy that any more ”			2
it was around that time we started to think there might be something special there			0
’ it was around that time the young @entity63 fast bowler began attracting the attention of @entity66 ’s selectors			0
former @entity12 all - rounder @entity67 was then the coach and he recalls what marked the quickie out from the rest			1
@entity71 salutes victorious @entity12 effort @entity73 away : @entity1 goes on a celebration run after the wicket of @entity76 at @entity77 on saturday ‘ he was a quiet lad , potentially shy , very respectful , ’ @entity67 said			1
‘ he always worked hard and was very determined			0
he was perhaps a little bit nervous of the environment he found himself in but he has an inner strength and confidence			0
‘ he had some pace and the ability to swing the ball consistently			0
there was a snap and a quirkiness to his action which made him slightly unpredictable and batsman always seemed to be rushed when they faced him			0
’ after breaking into the @entity12 one - day side as a 20 - year - old in late 2002 , the same year he made his first - class debut , @entity1 excelled at the @entity93 in 2003 , taking a hat - trick against @entity95			1
he took five for 73 on his test debut against @entity95 the following year but struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting @entity98 , with world - class fast bowlers @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 forming @entity12 ’s pace attack during the fabled 2005 series as @entity1 carried the drinks			1
a stress fracture of his back the following year gave him the chance to tweak his action and to make important strength and conditioning improvements to improve his core strength and ensure it did not become a recurring nightmare			2
‘ when @entity1 came on the scene he was able to offer something to @entity122 cricket that we did n’t really have then , ’ said his former @entity66 team - mate and his friend , @entity117			1
‘ he was 90mph bowler with an unusual action who was young and exciting			0
‘ but it has n’t all gone perfectly for him			0
growing up when you ’re on the international scene is tough because if you have a loss of form everybody sees it			2
then obviously he had his stress fracture in 2006 and at that point his international career was really in the balance			2
but from then on he has n’t really looked back			0
‘ however longer he plays for will largely come down to fitness			0
but if he remains fit then he ’ll be taking wickets			2
if he plays for another two or three years he could achieve a level in cricket that very few people have got to in the history of the game			2
’ multitalented : @entity1 had a good go with the bat too as @entity12 dominated in the fourth test with more overs already under his belt than any bowler in @entity122 history , it is inevitable @entity1 will have rubbed a few batsmen up the wrong way			1
he has worked on his mental approach to the game with @entity12 psychologist @entity157 , calling himself @entity158 on the field , and @entity39 off it			1
‘ when any sportsman plays he has an arousal state he needs to get to in order to perform at his best			0
if he pushes past it he wo n’t perform and if he does n’t reach it he wo n’t perform , ’ said @entity67			0
‘ some people need to get themselves revved up to a particular level			0
we play the game to rules with parameters for behaviour and we all know what is acceptable and unacceptable			0
you get out there and play hard and get on with it			0
we ’ve never had any issues with @entity1 at all			1
he ’s a very determined cricketer who gives you a very hard battle when you play against him			0
’ his combative , in - your - face on - field persona is at odds with his off - field image as a quiet , reserved man with a dry sense of humour			1
‘ he ’s got lots of sides to his personality , ’ @entity186 adds			0
‘ he ’s a very quiet guy but he ’s got a very funny side to him			2
he ’s always after a practical joke or a laugh			0
his favourite impression is @entity195 meets @entity117			0
i find it very difficult to have a conversation with him without him breaking into that at some point			0
’ next week at @entity9 , his dad @entity38 and mum , @entity202 , will be in the crowd desperate for their son to succeed			1
‘ i ’m proud of what he ’s done and what he ’s achieved , ’ @entity38 added			1
‘ it ’s unbelievable for us really			0
‘ we just sit there and watch			2
even now after 11 years of him playing for @entity12 you so sometimes look around and think ‘ that ’s our little boy out there playing for @entity12			1
’ huge influence : @entity1 has been a big player during his 11 - year @entity12 career and wants more records			1

final test of series with @entity8 sees him eight wickets from a record total
@entity1 is already @entity12 's leading wicket taker in all formats
he was once a tearaway but will be remember as one of @entity12 's greatest
his @entity38 says he has always been competitive but was quiet
@entity1 has achieve a lot in his 11 - year @entity12 career
his parents will be in the @entity9 crowd to watch him from next friday
