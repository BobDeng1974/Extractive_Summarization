' i wo n't comment on the sums , but i will say that it 's not the wages that @entity7 used to pay in the past , ' @entity6 told @entity37			2
the former @entity1 international gets emotional during his last playing appearance for @entity7 in 2009 ' i do n't mind players earning money , but it should mean at the same time that the club is doing good			1
' if the club is doing good , the club is getting income , then the club can share it with the players			0

' i think that the average wage in @entity1 is too high			0
they wo n't be financially independent from the money they earn here ( @entity7 )			0
' they earn good money , but i think there has to be the desire to develop , to go on to a bigger league and earn your money there			0
' @entity7 's wage cap might have restricted his options a little but @entity6 said the chance to work with one of @entity100 's great finishers - himself - may have helped attract players			1
