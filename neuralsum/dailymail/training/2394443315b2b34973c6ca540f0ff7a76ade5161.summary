his name is @entity2 and all he wants is a loving family to take him into a new home			1
but it seems when potential owners see him , they turn their noses up			1
why ? because this particular pooch has two noses			1
unfortunate : @entity2 is struggling to find a home because of his peculiar facial feature the unfortunate dog , who is a @entity17 , is currently being looked after by staff at the @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the @entity24 cross was handed to the centre by the local dog warden , and staff at the trust are worried his bizarre looks will get him overlooked			1
he has a rare congenital defect which gives him the appearance of having two noses			1
@entity32 said : ' instead of his nostrils being fused together he 's got some sort of split there			1
' it 's a defect in his palate which gives him the appearance of having two noses as his nostrils can move completely independently of each other			1
' i 've never seen the condition in my 20 - year career			2
' as other dogs around him are rehomed , he is struggling to attract a new owner , despite being at the centre for more than a month			1
he is only four - months old and has already been in four previous homes in his short life			2
but he has been given an endearing name by staff to make him feel at home			2
striking : the dog has four nostrils , an attribute potential owners seem to dislike when they see @entity2 supportive : staff at the care home gave him the endearing name because of his odd appearance to add to his unique appearance @entity2 can also move both noses independently of each other			1
the centre 's manager @entity66 said : ' we take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but i have never seen anything quite like @entity2			1
' it is such a shame to think that this sweet - natured lad may not find the loving home he deserves just because he may not be considered a pretty pooch			2
turning their noses up : when owners look down at the @entity24 cross , they see his weirdly partitioned nose while other dogs have more success when it comes to finding a new home at the @entity91 centre , @entity2 has found it tough obedient : staff at the centre say @entity2 would be a perfect dog to train ' he is an affectionate , energetic fun - loving boy who adores his carers			1
he needs an active family and could live with a compatible dog and children over the age of 14			2
' he may not have been blessed with the looks of @entity103 but he has a heart of gold and really can claim to be a dog in several million			2
" @entity107 , supporter relations officer at the @entity91 said : ' he is just a typical , fun , bouncy puppy			2
' he is very keen to learn and would be perfect to train up for any potential owner			1
' @entity110 : the puppy is only four months old , but has already been rehomed four times desperate : @entity94 said he was just a ' typical ,			0
bouncy puppy ' who really wanted to find a home homeless : he was handed into the centre by his former owner things looking up ? staff at the centre say he is an energetic puppy , despite failing to attract an owner the deformed calf which was born with two heads in @entity127 the piglet from @entity129 in southern @entity131 's @entity130 was born with three eyes and two mouths in december , a village in northern @entity127 was shocked by the birth of a two - headed calf			1
the young animal was named @entity138 , which means ' @entity140 ' in @entity141			0
after its birth , the creature attracted a lot of attention , with locals of @entity147 , a village less than 20 miles from @entity149 , flocking to the farm to see it			0
the calf is known as @entity153 , which means having more than one head			0
just a few days earlier , a two - headed piglet came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born in @entity158 , capital of eastern @entity131 's @entity159			0
unfortunately for the animal , vets said it would find it very hard to survive with the mutation			0
in june , the @entity164 in @entity165 also welcomed a bizarre addition - a two - headed turtle they named @entity169			0
the female @entity165 cooter was born with four others on june 18 displayed at the zoo 's @entity164 - swimming and walking as normally as her one - headed brothers and sisters			0
the condition is supposedly common among snakes and turtles			0
in 2011 , a piglet from @entity129 in southern @entity131 's @entity130 was been born with three eyes and two mouths			0
@entity182 , owner of a local pig farm , said the piglet was one from a 12 - strong litter			0
