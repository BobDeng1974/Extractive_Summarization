the @entity10 suits , made specifically for each member of the team , will be dropped and the team will return to their old kit after complaining that the design was ruining their medal chances			1
no @entity6 skater has finished higher than seventh in six of the 12 @entity20 events so far in @entity21 , despite the speedskaters dominating competitions in the run up to the @entity24			1
unsuitable : the uniforms worn by the @entity6 speedskating team are largely being blamed for their poor performance			1
here @entity29 skater @entity28 ( front ) takes @entity31 while @entity6 trails behind crash : @entity6 team member @entity33 ( left ) crashes out of the 5000m short track speedskating relay , as @entity35 ( right ) of the @entity36 overtakes @entity37 of the @entity6 competes during the women 's 1000m @entity39 event on day 6 of the @entity41 at @entity42 on february 13 , 2014 in @entity21 , @entity43 the @entity44 has agreed to allow the @entity6 to switch to their old kit , as long as it had been approved at the start of the season			1
under @entity20 rules every member of the team must be wearing the same type of kit			1
skaters had complained that vents on the backs of the suits were letting air in , which was affecting their performance			0
the high - tech suits , developed in relation with aerospace and defense giant @entity62 , were touted as the ' fastest speedskating suit in the world '			1
because they were only recently completed , the team did n't get to try the @entity68 suits in the competitive arena until the start of the @entity24			1
@entity72 executive director @entity71 told the @entity73 the team had been divided about the suits			2
' the general feeling from the athletes , it 's pretty darn close to 50 - 50 , ' @entity71 said on friday , one day before the team agreed to switch back to the old outfits			2
@entity36 ' @entity78 and @entity6 @entity79 ( @entity80 ) compete during the women 's @entity39 1000 m at the @entity42 during the @entity41 on february 13 the new ones had been exclusively designed for the @entity6 team			1
under @entity10 scientists had visited their training facility in @entity87 and used a 3d image scanner to capture highly accurate digital measurements of the athletes from every angle			1
the final design featured strategically - placed polyurethane strips on the forearms , calves and forehead to reduce drag by breaking up the airflow , just like the dimples on a golf ball			0
on the inside of the thighs , patches of @entity102 are said to reduce friction by 65 percent			0
among the @entity6 athletes to under - perform is female star @entity107 , who has admitted to making alterations to her suit			1
' they did adjust one part on the back , but it was just putting rubber over the mesh there , ' she said after a hugely disappointing performance in the 1,000 , a race she dominated during the @entity120 season			2
' it had no effect , really			0
' similarly , @entity123 was a two - time @entity20 champion in the men 's 1,000 and looking to become the first male speedskater to win the same event at three straight games			1
his eighth - place showing wednesday was the first indication that something might be seriously wrong with the @entity6 team 's preparation			1
@entity6 @entity123 competes in the the men 's @entity39 1000 m at the @entity42 during the @entity41 on february 12 , 2014 ' i 'm honestly being as optimistic as i can possibly be , ' he said			1
' i 'm just staying focused on the 1,500 - meter race			0
suit or no suit , i 've got to go out there and try to win			0
that 's what i 'm going to do			0
' despite the switch , both the coaches and @entity10 have defended the suits and what they are capable of			2
' the evidence does not suggest that the suits have contributed to the disappointing results to date , ' @entity146 executive director @entity71 said in a statement that was emailed to @entity150			0
' however , there are many factors that determine @entity20 success and we are constantly making adjustments to improve results			2
' under @entity10 also provided a statement from @entity158 , the senior vice president of innovation			2
' while a multitude of factors ultimately determine on - ice success , many skaters have posted personal - best sea - level heat times , split times or race times this week , and we 're rooting for that to translate into medals over these next couple of days , ' he said			0
coach @entity170 had scoffed at the notion that the suits are the only reason for the @entity6 struggles			2
' the human factor is by far the largest piece out there , ' he said			0
' there 's not an athlete out there who is slowing down a second per lap because of the suit they 're in			0
' anyone who thinks that does n't know speed skating			0
what is it : a parachute on their back ? there are guys out there in low - technology suits			0
' the @entity196 are out there ... in mostly @entity198 suits with some rubber , and they 're wiping us all over the place			0
' @entity6 skater @entity202 , who finished 15th in the 1,000m and who will also race in the 1,500m with @entity123 , said the disappointing results had soured the mood in the camp with six events remaining			1
' we are all a little down right now , ' said the former inline skater			0
' we could make a list of everything that 's wrong , it could be the suits , could be the food , we do n't know			0

new skinsuits , created by @entity62 , were finished right before the @entity24 , leaving little time to adjust to them
