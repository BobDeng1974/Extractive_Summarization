@entity0 is the man his son @entity1 could not live with , but is now discovering he is someone he can not live without			1
during what was the most extraordinary young career motor racing has ever known , @entity2 was the other , no-less important half of the partnership			0
it was @entity0 who provided the bristling competitiveness that railed against any notion that he and his precocious elder son were second to anyone			2
when @entity1 strayed , as he was wont to do , @entity0 brought him in line			1
a trifling but revealing incident : i remember when @entity1 was in a bad mood after a grand prix in @entity38 and wanted to avoid his media commitments			2
@entity0 joined him in the @entity40 that @entity1 wanted to act as his get - away car			1
a few minutes later @entity1 got out and returned to the @entity17 motorhome			2
@entity0 said to me : ‘ i have told him to go back in there and do his job			1
’ who is offering the same instruction since @entity1 dismissed his father four years ago ? not @entity40 , who treat him with kid gloves			1
were @entity0 still @entity1 ’s manager , would he have allowed him to take a dog into the paddock ? would he have allowed him to fly so many tiring long - haul journeys to and from @entity54 ? would he have indulged @entity1 ’s distracting associations with rappers and the wider celebrity whirl ? no , no , no. in the shade : @entity0 was fiercely protective of his eldest son , as several anecdotes reveal it is not sustainable to suggest – as @entity40 ’s yes - men do – that his lifestyle has no impact on his performance			1
he is operating in a sport that separates the best from the next best by the smallest of margins			0
it is unimaginable that @entity1 , had he developed his talent as he ought , would be sitting second in the table to @entity73 , a decent driver indeed but one who holds the upper hand only by dint of dedicating himself wholly to the task at hand			2
nor is this season a one - off			0
@entity1 was out - scored by @entity80 in their three years together at @entity17			2
that is a remarkable statistic when one remembers the extent of the young @entity1 ’s talent and success			1
the best book written among the flurry of biographies that accompanied @entity1 ’s early transcendent arrival in @entity21 is @entity92 ’ @entity91 : the @entity93			1
it alone saw the full significance of @entity0 in the rise of @entity1			1
i repeat here a telling vignette from the @entity100 appearance on @entity101 in 1997			0
@entity1 had uncharacteristically finished fifth in a kart race			0
@entity0 asks him : ‘ what ’s it doing ? is it gripping up ? ’ @entity1 , lost in thought , shakes his head occasionally and they walk back to the paddock in silence			1
‘ i ’m unable to do absolutely anything , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ because you ’re not telling me what ’s happening			2
’ they walk on again , silent once more			0
celebrity status : @entity0 was pictured this week on a yacht in southern @entity117 with @entity118 and @entity119 the camera cuts , as @entity92 recalls , and returns to @entity1 some time later			1
‘ my dad ’s pretty hard on me , ’ he says			0
‘ and when it ’s not going to plan he ’s even harder			0
but we ’re a team and we work together			0
’ @entity1 then thinks again and adds : ‘ if my dad gave me advice about the track i would n’t take it because he does n’t know what it ’s like out there			2
i did n’t really give dad much advice ( about the karting problem ) but i ’ve told him now and i think he ’d going to try the old settings			0
’ @entity1 won the next race by miles			0
their closeness and their friction produced results			0
nothing can replicate that bond			0
staring into space : @entity0 trails @entity40 team - mate @entity73 by 29 points i understand that @entity1 wants to be his own man and escape his father ’s control			1
that is natural , and it may help him in the long term			0
but if i were @entity91 and i was really more serious about winning the world title than anything else , i would ditch @entity154 ’s management , swallow my pride and ask @entity0 to come back as my manager , travelling companion , conscience and truest supporter			1
@entity1 may well win this year ’s championship but even to think that he might not , tells you how much @entity0 is missed .			1

@entity0 shaped the man who is currently fighting for his second world title
when @entity1 strayed , as he was wont to do , @entity0 brought him in line
were @entity0 still @entity1 ’s manager , would he have allowed him to take a dog into the paddock ?
it is not sustainable to suggest – as @entity40 ’s yes - men do – that his lifestyle has no impact on his performance
@entity1 should swallow his pride and ask @entity0 to come back as manager , travelling companion , conscience and truest supporter
