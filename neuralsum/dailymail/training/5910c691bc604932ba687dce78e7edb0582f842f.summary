a @entity1 motorist was left stunned after he found a cat stuck in the most unusual place - his jeep 's suspension spring			1
@entity6 , 32 , said that he had n't noticed anything when he 'd climbed into his @entity8 to set off on a business trip in @entity10 , @entity1			1
but after travelling for 50 miles at speeds of over 80mph he decided to stop at a petrol station to fill up			1
stuck in a rut : the cat had managed to get himself in a tight spot but mechanics still tried to free him tightly wound : this little cat looks unmoved by all of the attention he is receiving to free him from the suspension spring in @entity1 helping hand : one man shoves his hand right into the spring in an attempt to push the cat out he said : ' as i was filling up , i heard a noise that sounded like a cat meowing			1
i thought it might be under the car so when i put the fuel nozzle back i looked under the car and could n't see it , but i could still hear it			0
' after a little poking around i finally saw a patch of fur and realised the cat somehow ended up inside the spring			2
' i have no idea how long it was there , or far more importantly , no idea how it got there			0
i would have said it was impossible for a cat to get in the middle of a spring like that but somehow it had managed it			0
' you 're free : the cat appears to have a stretch as he is released from the spring after being stuck in a cramped position for a very long time nine lives : this cat had a lucky escape after being driven 50 miles unnoticed he quickly asked an attendant for help , but he could n't get the cat out			1
staff then called the police and fire service who eventually decided the only thing to do was dismantle the car and remove the suspension spring			0
surprisingly , the cat stayed calm throughout the three - hour ordeal to free him			0
he was then put into a box so he could be taken back to the large @entity1 island in the @entity74 in southeast @entity1 where his epic journey had begun			0
safe and sound : mechanics are still trying to work out how the animal ended up getting wedged inside the spring after a three - hour operation to free it			2

@entity6 did n't spot anything when he got into his @entity8
the driver from @entity10 , @entity1 travelled 50 miles at speeds of 80mph
but he decided to pull over at a petrol station and heard meowing
he spotted the tiny cat inside the spring and tried to free him
it took *rescuers* three hours to get the cat out of its unusual *hiding* place
