by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 19:26 est , 28 may 2012 for most children , getting their hands on an @entity3 is an opportunity to play games , watch videos and surf the internet			1
but at one primary school the @entity10 devices are being put to a more serious use – as a teaching tool for lessons in everything from maths to music			1
thirty - two @entity3 have been bought at a cost of £ 13,000 so that a whole class can use them at the same time			1
children as young as four are taking part			1
hands - on learning : a junior class at @entity25 get to grips with their new educational tool @entity28 , who is headmistress of @entity25 in @entity29 , @entity30 , said the flexibility of the curriculum meant the @entity3 could be used right across the primary school			1
‘ @entity35 children have used them in maths lessons and reception children have played some maths and phonics games , ’ she said			1
‘ @entity41 had them in their religious education lesson and @entity44 and six pupils have been using @entity3 in their topics , such as learning about the @entity47 by getting on the internet			2
’ the use of @entity3 is part of an overhaul of information and communications technology at the 214 - pupil school			2
mrs @entity28 added : ‘ we bought the @entity3 because they ’re so flexible and versatile			2
we ’ve got a lovely outdoor space here so the children can take them outside and even use them to take pictures			0
focus : the @entity3 are used by all year groups and in all subjects at the primary school ‘ we want learning to be fun for the children			0
the @entity3 are in use all the time			0
‘ if you walk around the school , there ’s a child somewhere or a group using the @entity3 which is what i want to see			0
’ however , mrs @entity28 insists books and conventional teaching methods such as pencil and paper are equally important			0
thought : the school spent £ 13,000 on 32 of the expensive @entity10 tablet devices earlier this year , @entity81 education spokesman @entity80 claimed school textbooks could be replaced by devices			1
an @entity85 report last year said pupils were showing high degrees of concentration when doing mental arithmetic on handheld games consoles			0
but dr @entity91 , a fellow of the @entity92 , has argued against a technology ‘ free for all ’			0
‘ children first need to learn how to concentrate before they start dividing their attention up with different windows on a screen and different forms of entertainment , ’ he said .			0
