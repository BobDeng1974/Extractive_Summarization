@entity8 , 31 who beat the child with a metal cooking spoon is facing a possible jail sentence the girl , who can not be identified for legal reasons , escaped from the house in @entity21 , north @entity22 , and police found her alone at a bus stop in @entity25 , east @entity22 , almost four hours later in the early hours of the morning			1
doctors identified 56 injuries when she was examined at hospital , @entity8 , who is a mother - of - three , accepted causing some of the injuries with the ten inch cooking spoon but said others must have been caused when the girl ' fell over			1
' prosecutor @entity33 told the court an argument started between @entity8 and the girl on august 15 last year during @entity37			1
' the girl was praying from the @entity6 and ms @entity8 accused her of lying about how many of the verses she had read , ' he said			2
' she was 10 at the time			0
ms @entity8 took a metal spoon about 10 inches in size and the @entity43 's case is that she hit the child with it repeatedly over a half an hour period , causing extensive bruising over both arms , her legs and head			1
mother - of - three @entity52 outside @entity12 where she was let out on bail before sentencing ' @entity43 's case is that ms @entity8 said she was going to kill the girl and ran to get a knife from the kitchen			1
' the girl had no alternative but to leave at around 10pm			0
' she got a bus and a train and it was about 1.50am when the police found her at a bus stop in @entity65 , @entity25			1
' she was on her own and extremely cold			0
she was taken to hospital and an examination found she had suffered 56 injuries			2
' @entity8 admitted a single count of child cruelty but insisted that she only used the spoon once or twice on the girl 's arms and bottom			1
she claimed the other injuries had been the result of the girl falling over			0
@entity8 also denied threatening to kill the 10 - year - old or picking up a knife			2
judge @entity79 accepted @entity8 's basis of plea , saying it would not be in the public interest for the child to give evidence			1
' the defendant has accepted she behaved in the wrong way towards the girl and there is absolutely no doubt that she behaved disgracefully , ' the judge said			0
' before the violence , she says had been asked to stretch her arms up in the air for a period of four hours			2
' she says she was hit all over with a spoon on her arms , legs , head and back about 20 times			0
' the basis of plea is that the defendant only admits causing injuries to the girl 's arms and bottom			2
' on the face of it , the defence assertion is incredible			0
but i do n't regard it in the public interest to make the child give evidence			0
' in any view , the defendant has behaved in an absolutely disgraceful way , and what an irony that the child was encouraged to behave in a godly fashion when this was far from godly			0
' but i undertake to sentence the defendant on her version of events and avoid further distress to the child			0
' adjourning the case until june 15 for reports , judge @entity79 told @entity8 : ' i 'm releasing you on bail but that gives no indication on what will be the eventual sentence			2
