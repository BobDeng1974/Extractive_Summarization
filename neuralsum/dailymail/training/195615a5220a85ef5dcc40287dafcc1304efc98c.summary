@entity1 famously published two recipes on it , @entity0 says if you ca n't do it , then you should n't be cooking at all , and @entity6 claimed they taste much better when they are been newly laid			1
the inexact science of cooking a perfectly boiled egg is one that has tripped up most home cooks			1
but now a simple little gadget , using temperature instead of time , can tell you exactly when you need to take an egg out of the water			1
the @entity19 timer uses temperature instead of time to deliver perfectly boiled eggs @entity1 says you must never boil an egg that has come straight from the fridge as it is likely to crack @entity27 - perfect timer $ 6 ( £ 4 ) plastic egg has soft , medium and hard indicators on its curved front and a flat surface on the other end which rests at the bottom of the pan			1
absorbing heat exactly as an egg does , the timer changes colour from the outside edge in as boiling eggs progess from raw to soft , medium or hard boiled			1
the clever device even automatically adjusts to the number of eggs and level of water in the pot so perfect eggs are delivered every single time			1
overcooked hard boiled eggs usually have a ring of grey around the yolk and a powdery texture the £ 4 egg - perfect egg timer the question of cooking a perfectly boiled egg has vexed many for decades			1
experts at the @entity60 devised a foolproof way to tell when an egg is boiled to perfection : a high - tech ink logo stamped onto the shell that indicates when the egg is soft , medium or hard - boiled			1
but can a complex culinary art really be reduced to a science ? looking at the advice of leading chefs , it seems the answer is that no two can agree on a single method - and @entity1 actually offers two			2
@entity75 said : ' the secret is not to boil it at all			2
growing up in the @entity79 after the war , we only had eggs as a treat on sundays as they were very expensive			0
' my mother would place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover them with cold water			0
then she put them on a medium heat			1
' as soon as the water began to simmer - not boil - she would remove the eggs			0
they would be cooked perfectly and were never rubbery			0
' if you like your eggs done a little more , then take the pan off the heat as soon as the water begins to simmer and leave the eggs in the hot water for around 30 seconds			0
@entity1 has two methods to cooking eggs @entity1 ’s book book , how to @entity104 , devotes two pages to the art of cooking eggs			2
she says you must never boil an egg that has come straight from the fridge as it is likely to crack			2
( incidentally , three @entity112 star chef @entity111 suggests putting cold eggs in hot - not boiling - water for a couple of minutes first			0
) use a small saucepan to prevent the eggs knocking into each other and breaking			0
also , always make a pinprick in the rounded end to prevent pressure building up in the air - pocket , which would crack the shell			0
@entity1 has two methods for producing an egg with a perfectly runny , golden centre			2
@entity127 : use a small saucepan filled with enough simmering water to cover the eggs by about half an inch			0
quickly , but gently , lower the eggs into the water , one at a time , using a tablespoon			2
simmer for one minute , remove the pan from the heat and put a lid on it			0
leave the eggs in the pan for six more minutes for a soft , fairly liquid yolk and a white that is just set but still quite wobbly			2
or for seven minutes if you like a firmer , more creamy yolk with a white that is completely set			0
method two : place the pan with the eggs in cold water on a high heat			0
when they reach boiling point , reduce to a simmer and cook for three minutes if you like a really soft - boiled egg ; four minutes for a white that is just set and a creamy yolk ; five minutes for a white and yolk perfectly set with a bit of ‘ squidgy ’ in the centre but chef @entity0 has a different method ' boiling an egg is not easy and if you can master it , then you are officially in a position to cook			1
i prefer to start the way my mother and my grandmother did — by putting the egg straight into boiling water			2
' dr @entity171 , a physicist from @entity172 has worked out a formula for the perfect boiled egg based on the ‘ heat - diffusion equation for spherical objects ’			1
according to his findings , a medium egg weighing 1.75oz ( 50g ) taken straight from a 4c fridge needs four minutes and 30 seconds in boiling water to give it a perfect soft centre			1
a smaller egg of 1.5oz ( 43g ) from the fridge takes four minutes 15 seconds to cook and a larger one — 2.25oz ( 63g ) — takes five minutes 30 seconds			1
a medium egg stored at room temperature ( 21c ) takes a few seconds under four minutes			1
' use a metal basket — for example , a deep sieve — to lower the eggs into the water together			0
that way , if you are cooking more than one , they will all be ready at the same time			1
' @entity196 , you are less likely to burn yourself on the hot water and steam or break the eggs by throwing them in too fast			0
' leave the eggs in the pan for precisely three minutes			0
then take them out and plunge them into another container filled with iced water , and you will have the perfect soft - boiled egg			1
in her seminal 1861 kitchen authority , @entity209 , @entity6 exhorts : ‘ eggs are much better when new - laid than a day or two afterwards			0
‘ the usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is three to 3.25 minutes : less time will not be sufficient to solidify the white , whereas longer will make the yolk less digestible			2
' great care should be employed in putting them into the water , to prevent cracking the shell			0

the @entity19 timer uses temperature instead of time to cook egg
@entity228 has hard , medium and soft boiled indicators on the front
colour changes as its cooking so you know when egg is done
