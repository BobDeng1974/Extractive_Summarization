@entity2 will record a @entity4 - language version of @entity5 ? , her agent confirmed today			1
mrs @entity6 is rumoured to have lined up a number of @entity4 acts , including @entity9 , for a continental take on the @entity13 song 's revival in aid of the fight against @entity16 in @entity17			1
earlier today , organizer @entity18 announced that the volume of pre-orders for the track ensured it had raised in excess of £ 1million within minutes of the song being premiered on tv last night			1

ms @entity2 's involvement was later confirmed to @entity36 by her agent			1
' the @entity38 go into bat today , i have asked the @entity38 to do the @entity38 version and i have asked @entity2 to do it in @entity4 , to translate it into @entity4 , so they 're going next			1
' @entity18 has called the track ' a little bit of pop history ' and said it delivered a powerful message about the urgent need to fight @entity16 , estimated to have killed more than 5,000 people in @entity17			1
he then went on to criticize the response from some national governments			0
' the @entity38 are n't doing enough , frankly			0
obviously the @entity4 have sent their troops to help in @entity54 and of course the @entity56 , the squaddies are down in @entity57 , ' he said			2
@entity18 , pictured on @entity58 last night , announced that both @entity38 and @entity4 are recording their own versions of the @entity13 song ' the @entity38 are the most powerful economy in @entity63			1
they are laggards and they should n't be			0
' it 's as dangerous for them as it is for us			2
this thing is a flight away from us			0
' the latest version of @entity5 , released today , has already raised more than £ 1million and is set to top the charts			1
if it does , it will become the fourth time the charity record has taken the number one spot			0
the original recording , which featured @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , was the biggest - selling single of all time in the @entity56 when it was first released			0
it led to the successful @entity87 concerts in 1985 , which raised around £ 150million for the fight against famine in @entity90			2
since then , there have been two further charity recordings of the same track , @entity13 in 1989 and @entity94 in 2004 , both of which also topped the charts			0
@entity13 included contributions from @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and sir @entity101 among others , while @entity94 featured @entity104 frontman @entity103 , sir @entity105 and @entity106 all together : the @entity13 2014 line up , from top row @entity109 : @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , @entity112 ( @entity111 ) , @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , @entity115 ( @entity111 ) , @entity103 , @entity116 ( @entity111 ) , @entity117 , sir @entity18 , @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , @entity120 , @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity123 ( @entity122 ) , @entity125 @entity124 ( @entity126 ) and @entity127 ( @entity126 )			1
@entity128 - r : @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 ( @entity122 ) , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142			0
@entity143 crouching : @entity144 , @entity78 the 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged @entity150 region of @entity151			2
although it also reached @entity153 , it sold just over one million copies , compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit			0
@entity94 was also criticised by the @entity156 , which said many of the song lyrics were ' patronising , false and out of date '			0
sir @entity18 said he was spurred to mobilise today 's pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola			1
' the nurse forgot where she was , and what was happening , and wiped a tear from the child , ' said sir @entity18			2
' the child died and the nurse died			0
you ca n't get more tragic than that			0
' after this , sir @entity18 – once disinclined to revisit do they know it 's @entity177 after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song			1
fixed in his mind , as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer @entity144 , was the image of the nurse wiping away the child 's tear			2
now the line ' where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears ' is replaced with ' where a kiss of love can kill you and there 's death in every tear ' .			0
