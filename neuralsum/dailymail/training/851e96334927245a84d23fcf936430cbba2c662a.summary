by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 30 july 2013 a university lecturer has apologised to the parents of a 15 - year - old girl who died after taking ecstasy tablets he 'd left stashed in his home during an unsupervised party			1
@entity8 , known as @entity9 , took two or three pills at the party at a west @entity13 townhouse owned by university lecturer @entity14 on @entity15 in april 2011			1
a group of young partygoers found a secret drugs stash - including ecstasy , lsd and ketamine - hidden by the academic , who was a lecturer at the @entity23 at the time , in a whisky container in a wardrobe cupboard in his bedroom			1
mr @entity14 today broke down in tears as he apologised to the parents of @entity8 for leaving the drugs in the house - claiming he did n't believe he was being irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised as there was a ' 0.1 per cent ' chance of his illegal narcotics being found			1
tragedy : @entity36 , 15 , pictured left , died in april 2011 after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the home of @entity14 , pictured right leaving the hearing , and @entity42 cleared : @entity14 , pictured with partner @entity42 , was given an eight month suspended sentence for drug possession after @entity46 's death			1
the couple have been told they will not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter at an inquest into her death , he turned to @entity55 's parents in the front row and said : ' i am so sorry about what happened			1
' all i can say was at the time i did n't feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised			2
' his voice cracked and he wiped away a tear as he added : ' in retrospect , i very much regret i had drugs at all and i made that decision			2
' but @entity14 refused to accept it was ' blindingly obvious ' he should not have left his house unsupervised to attend another party in @entity74 with his partner @entity42 that night			1
he said : ' at the time , it did n't seem likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start systematically looking through the drawers			0
' there was a 0.1 per cent chance of anyone finding those drugs , there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes a fire and people die			2
' death : the @entity95 home of lecturer @entity14 where he kept drugs but insisted they would be ' virtually impossible ' for the teenagers to find addressing mr @entity14 , @entity100 coroner dr @entity99 said : ' is n't it blindingly obvious 14 to 15 - year - olds are very likely to take the opportunity to misbehave and to really push the boundaries , and you should not have left them unsupervised			1
' @entity14 said the teenagers usually invited to his home for parties did not appear to be big drinkers , and the idea they were look for his drug stash never occurred to him			1
' i had never had the experience of our bedroom being used by anyone but @entity42 and myself ' , he said			0
' at none of the other parties had anyone gone into our bedroom , even a party that was unsupervised until 3am - it was a no go area			2
' he added : ' i did n't think that people would go through our drawers in our bedroom , i did n't think anyone would go into our bedroom at all			0
' you would have to go through 15 drawers before exhausting all the convenient drawers to look through			0
' the inquest has heard at previous parties at his home , a teenage girl had to be put to bed for being too drunk and there had been cannabis smoking			1
but mr @entity14 said : ' there had never been evidence of drug taking and never serious problems with people getting drunk and being sick , or having to be driven home			1
' it seemed to me from parties that we had supervised , people would sneak in very small beers or cider			0
' the lecturer said the teenagers appeared to be ' polite and studious ' , adding : ' at that time , i felt that party was going to be safe			2
' i felt it was important to occasionally demonstrate a degree of trust to that generation of kids , i felt it would show trust			0
' i really did not think that people would search the bedroom			0
' untimely death : flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets mr @entity14 previously admitted four counts of drugs possession when he appeared in court after @entity9 â€™s death and was sentenced to eight months in prison , suspended for two years in december 2011			1
the lecturer was today told at the hearing he would not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter over the pills being ' readily accessible '			1
dr @entity99 said : ' it has been decided there are no further prosecutions that can be brought			0
' @entity14 's partner @entity42 told the inquest she believed his drug stash was ' virtually impossible ' for the partying teenagers to find			1
ms @entity42 admitted she knew her partner of 27 years was a recreational drug user , but she did not want to know where they were hidden in the house			2
she told the inquest @entity14 regularly smoked marijuana or hash cannabis , and was aware he had taken lsd and ecstasy in the past			1
@entity197 only confessed where his drug stash was hidden , inside a whisky bottle in the bedroom closet , when they drove back from @entity74 following @entity55 's death			1
' i knew he had hash and marijuana , and that that had , i ca n't remember dates , but i know i had asked him if he had any ecstasy or other drugs ' , she said			2
mourning : friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7c after taking the drugs ' if he had anything in his possession , he said i would n't have to worry about it , they would be very well concealed			1
' ms @entity42 said @entity14 moved his whisky tin of drugs to different places round the house , often picking hiding places which were ' high up '			1
she said she had ' deduced ' he would have drugs in the house because she knew he used them , but added : ' i chose not to find out where it was			2
' she told the inquest : ' @entity229 from @entity74 , he told me			0
he told me that there were drugs hidden in the top cupboard			0
' it was in the early stages , before we knew what had happened , and he said it was virtually impossible it could have been drugs in the house that would have been the ones			0
' he said we could n't have any problems with any of the kids finding them			0
' he told me he had them right at the back of the cupboard , they were in our bedroom in the top cupboard			0
' he told me that there was lsd ecstasy , and that there was a very small amount of ketamine			0
' asked by the coroner why she had not tried to find the drugs , ms @entity42 said : ' i believed that @entity14 is extremely responsible , and that if he told me they were extremely well hidden , i preferred not to know			1
' ms @entity42 admitted ' eight or nine ' teenage parties had been held at their home prior to @entity55 's death , although this was the first to be unsupervised			1
hearing : an inquest at @entity262 in @entity13 heard that the schoolgirl would ' probably ' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell she had been forced to help a drunk teenage girl at a previous party , and accepted it was ' not totally outrageous ' that drug taking , drinking , and underage sex could take place at a party			1
' is n't that why you would generally supervise the parties , because of the risk that something can go wrong ? ' , asked dr @entity99			0
' surely it is absolutely barn door obvious the risk of alcohol , cannabis , and teenage behaviour is more likely to go up if the party is unsupervised			2
' ms @entity42 said she had asked a neighbour to be ' on call ' during the party in case of emergency			0
she added : ' when i weighed up whether it was wise or unwise to go and leave the kids at the party , i heard the views of a number of people whose children are the same age , i came to the conclusion it was a manageable risk			2
' shortly after taking the drugs , @entity9 began hallucinating and frothing at the mouth , the hearing was told			1
but her friends only called an ambulance when she collapsed and started shaking - about an hour after she took the pills			0
when paramedics arrived at the house in leafy @entity95 , west @entity13 , her temperature had soared to 41.7c - compared to the normal body temperature of @entity312 , @entity262 heard			0
@entity9 was taken to @entity313 , but she died later that morning			2
professor @entity314 , a forensic toxicology expert based at @entity316 in @entity13 , said @entity9 could have survived if she had been taken to hospital before her temperature had risen so dangerously out of control after she took the drugs			1
he said : ' that is a very high temperature			0
the start of irreversible death is something like @entity324 , a temperature of @entity326 is very high			0
' it may have been possible that she would have survived had help been summoned earlier when her temperature was not quite so high and she was unwell			0
' there are cases reported where hyperthermia can be treated			0
' the earlier help is sought , before the temperature rose to those high levels , it may have been possible had she been admitted to hospital that treatment could have been given to try and lower her temperature			0
' he said even with a temperature of @entity342 or 41c it is ' possible ' she could have survived			0
the 15 year - old suffered from suspected hyperthermia , brought on by taking two to three ecstasy tablets which were of ' high ' purity , the inquest heard			1
cause of death was given as ingestion of @entity351 - the active ingredient in @entity351			0
two other teenagers , who can not be identified for legal reasons , also took pills at the party and were taken to hospital			2

@entity360 died after taking up to three pills at unsupervised party
teenagers found the drugs in a whisky container at @entity14 's home
he was given a suspended sentence for four counts of drug possession
mr @entity14 will not face charges for gross negligence or manslaughter over drugs being ' readily accessible ' to the teenagers
inquest heard @entity9 may have survived if she 'd received treatment sooner
