a whistle blasts as the ‘ @entity1 ’ slides out of @entity3 ’s @entity2			1
@entity4 , our aqua blue - uniformed steward pops a bottle of prosecco			2
‘ @entity10 , fair city , ’ he says , saluting the shrinking skyline			2
for all its easy - going , egalitarian image , @entity13 ’s capital is an imperial city of gracious facades and plume - helmeted cavalry guarding a royal residence bigger than @entity19			2
@entity3 , with its old district of @entity22 to the fore , was the start - point for this grand rail journey no wonder the world ’s most illustrious train seems so at home here			1
my wife , @entity32 , and i have flown in to join her on a jaunt to @entity35 , the first leg of the train ’s journey home to @entity39			1
for us , it is a case of relishing the romantic opulence of 1920s - style rail travel , book - ended by another in each of two historic @entity46 capitals			1
we stay in regal style at the harbour side @entity3 , where @entity1 sets up its check - in desk in a lobby which , alarmingly , is swirling with silk gowns and gents in white tie			1
suddenly they all sweep off into a gilded hall to meet @entity56			2
not our fellow travellers after all			2
it is a shortish walk to the @entity2 , where the gold - lettered , navy carriages stretch along the platform			2
we settle into our mahogany - panelled cabin			2
there is a washbasin in a corner cabinet , but loos are in a shared compartment down the corridor ( another touch of 1920s authenticity )			2
nor are there showers - which is why every night on board is followed by a city hotel stay			0
another route : although the train 's most famous destination is @entity39 , it also serves other @entity81 cities this privately - run train is not exactly heir to the renowned service immortalised by @entity85 which connected @entity81 cities with @entity88			1
on the other hand , the @entity89 and @entity90 vintage rail coaches restored by the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) company clearly share the same gene pool			1
@entity95 - to - @entity39 is the train ’s stock - in - trade			1
but these days the company sets its bounds wider , with numerous different @entity81 departures			0
modern trains designed for speed and with @entity102 can make the journey down @entity13 ’s east coast and over the @entity105 to @entity35 in less than five hours			1
however , the point of this venture is to stretch and savour the experience , so instead we strike out first across central @entity13 towards @entity110			0
from here , our meandering route takes us down the west coast to @entity114 on the country ’s southern tip , facing the @entity118 capital			0
between dark tunnels we snake alongside lakes and through forests of fir hung with lichen beards			0
silver service : guests on the @entity1 step up into a world of luxury and sophistication but bewitching though the landscape proves , for most people the focus of this trip is the on - board scenery			1
dinner is the principal event , served in a trio of dining cars decorated with art deco marquetry and @entity140 glass panels			0
@entity32 slips on a chic mauve dress , i change into my suit and tie and we settle down à deux to chef @entity146 ’s four - course dinner			0
the menu fuses @entity150 star - standard classical @entity148 with @entity152 twists ; fillets of reindeer marinated in aquavit , cooked in a cloudberry sauce			0
ah , cloudberries , those silky golden nuggets of appley rapture from the @entity160			0
after that we have digestifs in the bar car , where a pianist in a silver suit sits at a baby grand tinkling melodies including several @entity170 tunes ( inevitable , i suppose )			0
at least half the company is @entity46 , and a few liqueurs later an impromptu singalong breaks out			1
meanwhile , @entity4 is busy transforming the velvet bench seats of our cabin into roomy upper and lower bunks made up with crisp linen			0
‘ whose turn is it to go on top ? ’ giggles a tipsy lady down the corridor to her tuxedoed beau			0
@entity4 ’s sangfroid holds firm : the pinnacle of sophisticated travel this train may be , but i get the impression he is used to hearing variations on this bit of ribaldry			1
@entity118 delight : @entity35 , with its pretty @entity197 district , was the final destination the train rocks us to sleep			1
lights flicker across the window blind as @entity13 stations and a @entity205 incarnation of @entity206 weaves in and out of my dreams			0
we awake to glimpses of inlets on the @entity211			0
croissants , coffee and fruit are served in our cabin as local people film us from bridges and level crossings			0
when we stop at @entity221 station , the platform is thronged with fans			0
we feel like film stars , though the real celebrity is the train			2
in the end there is a snag			0
the only locomotive allowed to haul these carriages over the @entity105 lacks a licence to pull passengers			0
so we wave goodbye to the @entity1 - or rather , the staff all line up on the platform and wave to us - at @entity114			1
we cross the 12 - km bridge in a plush bus , leaving our luggage to continue in grandeur on the otherwise empty train , and miraculously it reappears in our @entity35 hotel room			1
the @entity1 ( 0845 077 2222 , www.belmond.com )			1
two - day , one - night trips cost from £ 1,670 per person based on two sharing a cabin , including a four - course dinner and breakfast			0
there are year - round departures around @entity81 , with the next @entity3 - to - @entity39 - via - @entity35 jaunt in june 2015			1
flights from @entity251 to @entity3 and back from @entity35 cost from £ 180 with @entity253 ( www.flysas.co.uk )			1
accommodation is available at the @entity3 ( www.grandhotel.se ) and the @entity35 ( www.marriott.com )			1
four days ' meet - and - greet parking at @entity251 cost from £ 56 ( www.aph.com ) .			0

the @entity1 is best known for journeys to rail @entity259
however , this *fabled* train service also covers major cities in @entity46
it is possible to take a train journey between @entity3 and @entity35
