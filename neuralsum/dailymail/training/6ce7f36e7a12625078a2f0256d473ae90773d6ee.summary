time for new luggage ! tourists heading to @entity1 are now banned from trundling wheelie bags over the historic canals any visitor using a rubber - wheeled suitcase will be subject to fines of up to 500 euros authorities say that the noise of large tour groups dragging the bags over the bridges keeps local residents awake at night , and ultimately , amounts to noise pollution			1
