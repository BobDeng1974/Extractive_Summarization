it is the strongest signal yet from a senior conservative that the prime minister 's hopes of renegotiation could be rebuffed by other @entity12 leaders , making it more likely that the @entity2 quits altogether			1
conservative policy chief @entity7 suggested there was a one in five chance that the prime minister 's renegotiation strategy will fail , at which point he would recommend leaving the @entity3 in a referendum mr @entity5 has promised to claw back powers from @entity26 before holding an in / out vote referendum by 2017 , if he is still in power after the 2015 general election			1

' we have to have that referendum			0
we have to put to the @entity2 people that question			0
we will see whether what we are able to negotiate is acceptable			0
i think they deserve that choice			0
' if we do n't get the sort of position that i was describing then i would n't want to recommend staying , i would want to recommend leaving			1
it 's better than being absorbed into a @entity11 of @entity12			1

i ca n't guarantee it			0
i do n't know what the chances are , but i think they are more like 80/20 than 20/80			0
