a school which asked students to compare @entity2 to convicted cop - killer @entity3 in a lesson plan has been branded an ' absolute disgrace '			1
@entity6 , whose husband @entity7 was shot by @entity3 in 1981 , blasted the taxpayer - funded plan , saying it advocated violence			1
the lesson , given to students in @entity13 , @entity14 , asked them to draw a ' possible parallel ' between civil rights activist @entity2 , and ' someone else many believe is currently targeted by the @entity19 government , @entity3			1
' students were asked to compare @entity3 ( left ) , who was convicted of killing a policeman in 1981 , and @entity2 who had a policy of strict non-violence speaking to @entity23 , @entity6 said : ' it ’s a travesty			1
you ’re going to teach children about a man who murdered a police officer ? ' that ’s not a good lesson to be teaching children			2
he was a radical , a militant			0
' the plan , written by teacher @entity34 and designed for 11h grade students , also asks them to consider the following statement : ' the media , prison system and law enforcement organizations have censored @entity3			1
' on one hand , there have been occasional stories in print and broadcast media about @entity3			2
' on the other , despite the widespread support for @entity3 that has made his case the most renown and controversial of death penalty cases in the world today , these stories are extremely rare and always refer to him as a " convicted cop - killer			2
" ' the plan was posted on the @entity54 ’s website			0
@entity55 , spokesman for the district , said the lesson plan is no longer part of the curriculum			1
' the fact that a website documenting @entity62 remains accessible is an oversight related to technology management ; it does not speak to current instructional practice in @entity54 , ' @entity55 told @entity23 in an e-mail			0
@entity67 was killed during an early - morning traffic stop in @entity69 in 1981 ' to avoid any confusion in the future , we will conduct an inventory of the numerous websites created to support learning districtwide to ensure they conform with our present academic philosophy and do not inadvertently misrepresent @entity13 schools			1
' @entity3 was convicted of @entity80 's murder after his brother got into a scuffle with the policeman during a 4am traffic stop in @entity69			1
@entity6 was shot several times and died at the scene , @entity3 was later found with a bullet wound from @entity67 's gun , and a .38 calibre handgun registered to @entity3 was found at the scene			2
it took a @entity93 jury just thre hours to find him guilty and he was sentenced to death			0
however , over the years @entity3 challenged the predominantly white makeup of the jury , the instructions given to the jurors and the accounts of eyewitnesses			0
@entity3 had his sentence reduced to life in jail in 2011 after three decades of campaigning by supporters he also said that his lawyer was ineffective , that the judge was racist and that another man confessed to the crime			0
the one - time journalist 's own 1995 book , ' @entity111 , ' depicts prison life and calls the justice system racist			0
he got worldwide support from the ' @entity3 ' movement , with hundreds of vocal supporters and death - penalty opponents regularly turning out for court hearings in his case			0
in 2011 the sentence was downgraded to life imprisonment after @entity122 agreed to the decision			0
