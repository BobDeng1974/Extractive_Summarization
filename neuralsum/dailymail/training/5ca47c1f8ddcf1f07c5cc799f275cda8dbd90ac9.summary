just two months after the launch of its new £ 1 make - up range , @entity0 has had to fly in extra stock to keep up with the phenomenal demand			1
it ’s had great reviews from shoppers , but i find budget ranges sometimes do n’t work well for mature skins , failing to cover up signs of ageing			1
so identical twins @entity12 and @entity14 , 64 , volunteered to try the @entity0 products to see if they could tackle baggy eyes , thin eyebrows and freckles			1
she used @entity0 make - up worth £ 10 on @entity14 , and designer brands worth a staggering £ 400.50 on @entity12			1
can you tell the difference ? foundation both sisters were concerned that their skin had pigmentation patches , as well as freckles , so a good base was essential			2
both sisters were concerned that their skin had pigmentation patches , as well as freckles , so a good base was essential @entity24 first used a premium primer , @entity41 , £ 36 , ( bobbibrown.co.uk ) on @entity12 before using a foundation , @entity43 , ( £ 28 , @entity44 ) , which went on easily , giving @entity12 ’s skin an even tone			1
she also used three types of illuminating and highlighting powder : to reflect light , give staying power and make the skin matte			0
these were @entity53 , £ 45 johnlewis.com ) , @entity54 , £ 35 , and @entity55 , £ 56 ( both @entity56 ) @entity24 first used a premium primer , @entity41 , £ 36 , ( bobbibrown.co.uk ) could the @entity0 ’s @entity58 with vitamin e , @entity60 and uvb filters in @entity62 compete ? @entity24 said : ‘ this is a brilliant foundation			1
the colour is very natural and texture not too greasy or dry			0
‘ once the @entity0 product was well blended , you could n’t tell the difference between the two foundations			1
’ @entity70 ? natural and effective.9 / 10 @entity71 vital for older women , bronzer gives a touch of colour to the skin , which can get paler as we age			0
brush lightly in the hollow under cheeks to give definition			0
@entity24 used @entity81 in @entity82 , £ 27 ( narscosmetics.co.uk ) for the premium brand			1
she also used a small eye - shadow brush to trace a soft line of bronzer under the lower lashes to give the eyes definition ) and swept a little on the jawline with a bigger brush to reduce the look of a double chin			2
@entity24 says : ‘ the good to glow @entity95 was so good i would be happy to have it in my own make - up bag			1
’ @entity70 ? sits well on skin			0
10/10 @entity24 used a slick of @entity0 ’s @entity100 in @entity101 on @entity14 ’s face @entity103 a hint of blusher on cheeks gives a rosy glow to older complexions			1
‘ @entity0 ’s @entity110 blusher was dry , cakey and contained lumps of glitter so i knew it would be ageing , ’ says @entity24			1
‘ instead , i used a slick of @entity0 ’s @entity100 in @entity101 on @entity14 ’s face and blended well , then i dusted the blusher on top to make it stay and to give a matte finish			1
’ the premium make - up , @entity120 in 500 , £ 35 ( debenhams.com ) went on like a dream : proof a pricier cream blusher is well worth it			1
@entity70 ? ageing and cakey			0
3/10 @entity24 used identical bright pink lipsticks on the lips of both twins			2
first , she outlined their lips using a lip brush , then filled them in and added a touch of gloss lipstick and gloss @entity24 used identical bright pink lipsticks on the lips of both twins			2
first , she outlined their lips using a lip brush , then filled them in and added a touch of gloss			0
she says : ‘ the colours of the premium brand , ( @entity143 in @entity144 , £ 18.50 , bobbibrown.co.uk ) and the @entity0 version ( all about the @entity140 in @entity101 ) were the same			1
but there was a real difference when it came to texture			0
@entity0 ’s was oily meaning it would come off the second you went near a glass of wine , and it sank into lip lines			2
‘ however the gloss ( @entity155 ) was a winner : lovely packaging and good value for £ 1			1
@entity143 in @entity159 ‘ it gave the same effect as more expensive products ( @entity164 @entity163 in @entity165 , £ 17.50 , maccosmetics.co.uk ) there really is no point in paying more for a gloss			2
’ @entity70 ? only the gloss shone			0
8/10 & 2/10 @entity170 both twins have prominent eyes , but eyeliner pencil dotted in between upper lashes makes them look fuller			0
‘ i did n’t love the @entity175 in @entity176 , ’ says @entity24			2
‘ the colour was weak so it took me three times as long to get the same effect as with the premium brand			0
’ she then used liquid eyeliner , @entity0 ’s @entity183 and @entity184 , £ 22 ( @entity56 ) to draw a little flick at the side of each eye to give a lift			1
@entity70 ? liquid eyeliner was better than kohl pencil			0
5/10 & 2/10 @entity191 @entity24 curled the twins ’ lashes first to give a lovely open - eyed look before applying mascara			2
@entity195 in @entity176 01 ‘ @entity195 in @entity176 01 , £ 22 , johnlewis.com ) has an angled brush so you can get right to the roots of the lashes , ’ she says			0
‘ this was easily replicated on the @entity201 , by bending the brush at right angles			0
but nothing could disguise that it just did n’t have the thickening , lengthening look the premium brand has			0
’ @entity70 ? no luscious lashes here			0
4/10 @entity208 ‘ unfortunately , @entity0 ’s eyeshadow ( @entity210 in @entity211 5 ) , was underpowered ; unlike the @entity212 in 13 @entity213 , £ 18 , ( debenhams.com ) it had no staying power so i popped a slick of the @entity0 blusher over the top			1
’ @entity70 ? not a great eyeshadow			0
4/10 eyebrows the twins hate their barely - there eyebrows so @entity24 filled them in with eyebrow pencils			1
‘ the @entity0 version ( take a @entity225 in @entity226 ) was pretty impressive , ’ she says			2
‘ it only fell down because the colour was n’t quite as intense			0
’ @entity24 used @entity228 , @entity229 , £ 23.50 ( beautybay.com ) on @entity12			1
@entity70 : not enough pigment			0
7/10 the twins ’ verdict @entity237 : ‘ after eating a meal i had to top up the lipstick			0
apart from that , my make - up made my skin look younger and stayed that way until 10.30pm			1
’ @entity243 : ‘ i ’m really pleased with the @entity0 make - up			1
i thought i looked great , and its staying power is also good			0

after launching its £ 1 make - up range , @entity0 had to fly in extra stock
it ’s had great reviews from shoppers
@entity255 @entity12 and @entity14 , 64 , tried the @entity0 products
could the range tackle baggy eyes , thin eyebrows and freckles ?
make - up artist @entity24 spent £ 400 on one look and £ 10 on the other
can you tell the difference ?
