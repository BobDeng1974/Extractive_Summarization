@entity0 has set his sights on signing for a team in the @entity3 after deciding against joining @entity4			1
the @entity6 giants met with @entity0 in @entity7 last month and made two contract offers but a deal could not be agreed and the 22 - year - old now wants to stay in @entity11			1
that will please @entity13 , who stand to receive substantially more than they would have had the former @entity16 international gone abroad			0
@entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 are among the teams to have registered an interest but will want to pay less than the an estimated £ 8million tribunal figure based on the £ 1.5m fee @entity45 paid @entity13 to take @entity0 on loan for the second half of last season			1
had @entity0 moved abroad the compensation to @entity13 would have been just £ 155,000			2
‘ i am flattered to have received such strong interest from several big @entity53 clubs			0
but i believe at this early stage of my career i need to continue my football education in @entity11 , ' @entity0 said today			2
' i would like to thank the clubs overseas for their interest and kindness			0
i still have ambitions to one day play in @entity61			0
‘ i am now looking forward to what lies ahead next season			0
’ different path : @entity0 's father , @entity66 ( left ) , signed for @entity4 in 1995 but his son will not follow in his footsteps past glory : @entity70 played for @entity4 for two seasons between 1995 and 1997 but @entity0 will stay in @entity11 recognisable : @entity0 has turned down the chance to play at the @entity7 , a world famous stadium			1

@entity0 has rejected a move to @entity75 in *favour* of staying in the @entity3
the 22 - year - old was offered two contracts by the @entity7 outfit
@entity13 will get a substantially *higher* fee if he moves to an @entity11 side
@entity40 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity38 are interested in forward
