@entity0 will be asking @entity2 chiefs to fast - track the move to their new stadium at this rate			1
remarkably , this was @entity2 ’ first home saturday 3pm kick - off of the season			1
not that it helped , as @entity10 added to @entity0 ’s disappointing @entity12 record with a well - deserved point			1
from a possible 24 points , @entity2 have accumulated just 10 from their home league matches this season			1
@entity17 looks frustrated for @entity2 during their 0 - 0 draw with @entity10 at @entity12 @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity19 8 ; @entity20 3 , @entity21 6.5 , @entity22 6.5 , @entity23 6.5 ; @entity24 5.5 ( @entity25 66 ) , @entity26 6 ; @entity27 5 ( @entity28 46 , 6 ) , @entity29 6 , @entity30 6.5 ; @entity17 5.5 ( @entity31 83 ) subs not used : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 booked : @entity30 @entity10 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity37 7 ; @entity38 7 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 7 ; @entity42 8.5 , @entity43 7 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 6.5 ( @entity47 66 , 7 ) ; @entity48 7 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 referee : @entity24 attendance : 35 , 860 @entity57 : @entity42 ratings by @entity59 at @entity12 @entity44 's heat map for @entity10 click here for match zone from @entity12 in many ways , @entity0 will be the happier of the two managers this morning			1
he will certainly be the most relieved , as @entity67 ’s men squandered numerous chances to inflict another home defeat for @entity2			1
in explaining his side ’s lacklustre display , @entity0 said : ‘ we are frustrated , like the fans			1
‘ the team did not show freshness of other games , maybe because we played three games in six days			0
‘ it makes a difference if you have two days for recovery and the other team has three days [ @entity10 played @entity83 on tuesday , @entity2 played @entity84 on wednesday ]			1
‘ that extra day is massive but it is not an excuse			0
we realise the schedule will sometimes not be good			0

‘ i told them they could n’t have their party if they lost , so they can have it now , ’ he said			0
‘ i leave disappointed but proud we ’ve got a point			0
we had a chance to get three points at @entity12 , there ’s not many chances to do that now at my age			2
’ and the signs were there from the get - go , as @entity10 , in true @entity67 style , made life difficult for the hosts			1
@entity30 nearly opened the scoring for @entity2 in the seventh minute , firing into the side - netting after nutmegging @entity38 on the left - hand byline			1
but — led by left - winger @entity42 — @entity10 could easily have found themselves ahead in the opening 20 minutes			1
@entity124 ’s attempt at a defensive header from @entity42 ’s inswinging corner went inches from nestling inside @entity19 ’s far post in the 17th minute			0
three minutes later @entity43 should have hit the target after @entity42 produced an outrageous piece of skill to leave @entity20 — who had a torrid afternoon at right - back — and @entity30 for dead , before finding the @entity133 inside the area			0
spurs had chances of their own , @entity37 saving @entity30 ’s free - kick before the @entity136 stood up a cross that @entity17 should have buried			2
by the hour mark , the home crowd were restless			0
the team that had looked to be getting to grips with @entity0 ’s high - pressing style in the early stages of their 3 - 0 loss at @entity84 was nowhere to be seen			1
with 13 minutes left , @entity47 went close to giving @entity10 the lead they so deserved — hammering a shot on to the bar			2
seconds later , he had the ball in the net — but referee @entity24 had blown for offside			0
@entity47 was in the thick of the action again , waltzing through and finding @entity42 with a cut back — but his strike was superbly saved			0
the @entity10 bench could not believe it			2
nor could the home fans			0
a chorus of boos echoed round @entity12			2
they were even louder at full - time			0

@entity19 produced the first meaningful save of the second period , denying @entity167 after the winger skipped past @entity30 in the 55th minute			0
by this point , home supporters were getting restless			0
they have suffered so much at @entity12 already this season			2
spurs looked like they were finally getting to grips with @entity0 's high - pressing tactics during the opening 20 minutes of their 3 - 0 loss at @entity84 on wednesday			1
make no bones about it , they had the champions elect rattled in their own backyard			0
the tables were turned , @entity10 were forcing @entity2 onto the back - foot and the home side were struggling to find answers			1
@entity17 was presented with a guild - edge chance to ease the tension in the 63rd minute ; @entity29 playing him through - but the striker fired wildly wide with just @entity37 in front of him			0

then , with 13 minutes left on the clock , @entity47 came agonisingly close to giving @entity10 the lead they so deserved - hammering an angled shot onto the bar after @entity42 caused more havoc down the left			2
seconds later , @entity47 had the ball in the net - but referee @entity24 had already blown for offside			0
@entity47 was in the thick of the action again with nine minutes left to play , waltzing through @entity2 right - side before finding @entity42 with a cut back - but the forward 's firm strike was superbly saved by @entity19			1
the @entity10 bench could n't believe it			0
nor could the home supporters , as a chorus of boos echoed round @entity12			2
@entity31 was introduced for the final seven minutes , as @entity2 looked for an undeserved winner			0
but his substitution made little impact as the final whistle was greeted by more boos as the @entity0 's problems mount .			2

@entity2 held to a *goalless* draw at home by @entity67 's @entity10 side
the game at @entity12 was @entity2 's first saturday 3pm kick - off of the season
