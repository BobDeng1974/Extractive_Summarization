the @entity0 is planning to charge up to £ 5 for its hit programmes in a challenge to online services such as @entity4 and @entity5			2
as part of an ambitious online revamp , the @entity6 has already tested a @entity9 from which viewers will be able to buy episodes or series months or years after they are first broadcast			1
hit shows including @entity21 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and sir @entity20 ’s @entity19 will be for sale when the service launches next year			1
iplayer : the service will remain , but some backdated programmes could soon cost up to £ 5 to download the @entity0 eventually hopes to offer downloads of almost every show it makes			2
programmes on the free - to - use @entity24 will be also made available for 30 days instead of the current seven			1
one @entity0 source , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it is a no - brainer			2
at the moment viewers can only buy shows on @entity36 in somewhere like @entity37			0
‘ @entity15 would be offered for about 99p an episode and other series are being offered for about £ 5			1
’ the first series of the crime drama can be purchased from @entity5 for £ 5.99 and can also be watched on @entity4 – which charges subscribers £ 5.99 a month to stream shows over the internet			0
the @entity0 ’s plans still need to be approved by its governing body , but bosses have already begun testing the idea with focus groups			0
@entity21 will be included in the programmes to be charged for - which will still be cheaper than dvds volunteers are being asked to study mocked - up pages from the @entity9 website , which display a particular show together with details of its price and how to buy it			1
a page for the crime drama @entity15 , starring @entity62 , includes a price of 99p per episode or £ 1.49 for three – though a source last night said these were guide prices based on charges being offered by other services			1
@entity70 mp last night warned the @entity0 against overcharging licence - fee payers			0
