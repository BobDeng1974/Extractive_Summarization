dozens of women were abandoned unconscious in a field after being sterilised at a rural health centre in @entity4			1
two doctors carried 106 sterilisation operations in a single day at government - run @entity7 in @entity8 as part of mass ' health drive '			1
the patients should have been kept under observation for at least three hours , but with only 30 beds at the hospital reserved for women , they were left on the pavement with no medical assistance or protection against infections			1
the ill - equipped hospital has a total of 60 beds , only half of these are available to women , the rest to men			1
the hospital 's two doctors - dr @entity41 and dr @entity40 - carried out the procedures on over 100 women with the help of a gynaecologist , dr @entity48 , who was called from the nearby @entity51 rural healthcare centre			1
the sterilisation drive broke a number of rules regarding health and safety procedures , drastically overstepping the limit of 25 sterilisations per day and ignoring the three hours of observation			1
after the surgical procedure , the doctors asked the helpers to move every patient to the adjacent field , a majority of the women were still unconscious			2
disgrace : the image show women lying in a field outside the hospital with no medical aids and with only their relatives to help the patients were carried out and casually dumped under the open sky in the hands of their relatives			1
unable to bear the pain in the absence of proper care , some of them fainted			0
many of the patients were sent off on rickshaws , though they were not in a state to make any journey			0
a district health official said the hospital has no ambulance			2
' we all know there is a severe risk of morbidity during sterilisation and the question whether this has been taken care of or not , ' health activist @entity89 told @entity97			0
one of the patients , @entity99 of north @entity101 village , fell off the rickshaw as it collided with a matador			0
she was rushed back to the centre with critical injuries and was referred to the district hospital			0
risk : the images from @entity97 show an unconscious woman being lifted onto a blanket outside the hospital after her surgery no care : hospital workers have lifter a woman off a stretcher and are placing her on the pavement , leaving her unaided post-surgery local health officials acknowledged that the patients ' treatment was shockingly insufficient , and a full report has been requested from the hospital			2
@entity26 's chief medical officer of health ( @entity126 ) , @entity125 , said : ' we have come to know about the incident			0
we have ordered an inquiry and asked the hospital authorities to submit the report in the next 48 hours			2
' @entity125 , however , claimed that the @entity134 health centre has six doctors , including dr rang			0
@entity8 's women and child development minister @entity138 , who is also the local mla , said : ' this irresponsible act will not be tolerated			1
the @entity126 is looking into it and necessary action would be taken			0
' @entity138 said a section of doctors were deliberately trying to malign the government 's image .			0
