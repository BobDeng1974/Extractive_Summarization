transgender major @entity125 of the @entity127 speaks alongside sergeant @entity128 ( left ) of the @entity131 @entity130 transgender military personnel from 18 countries who allow them to serve openly , gathered to talk about their experiences the independent commission , led by a former @entity8 surgeon general , also concluded that president @entity138 could lift the decades - old ban without approval from @entity141			1
about 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving , nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance - altering way , according to the @entity146 think tank			1
dr @entity148 , who served as surgeon general during @entity151 's first term as president , and rear adm. @entity153 , a former chief health and safety director for the @entity154 , led the report that was released on thursday			0
' we determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban , but also that the ban itself is an expensive , damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active , guard and reserve components , ' it said			0
they also discussed at the conference whether the @entity8 military could join them earlier this year a report found there is ' no compelling medical reason ' for @entity8 armed forced to ban transgender @entity8 from serving the panel , convened by a think tank at @entity177 , said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment 's consensus , since revised , that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder			1
the ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult , disruptive and expensive			0
but the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel			0
' i hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do , and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else , ' @entity194 said in an interview			0
about 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving , nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance - altering way , according to the @entity146 , a think tank the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment 's consensus , since revised , that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder the ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult , disruptive and expensive at least a dozen nations , including @entity82 , @entity81 , the @entity80 and @entity220 , allow military service by transgender individuals			1
transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the @entity38 to revisit the blanket ban in the @entity8 since @entity141 in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military			2
the commission argued that facilitating gender transitions ' would place almost no burden on the military , ' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition - related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving			2
it estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $ 30,000			2
transgender major @entity94 of the @entity95 speaks at the conference retired brigadier general @entity244 , a former @entity90 commander and @entity246 professor on the commission , said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender - based harassment , assaults and suicides while enhancing national security			1
but @entity254 president @entity253 , whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops , predicted that putting transgender people in barracks , showers and other sex - segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel			1
' this is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly do n't need and they do n't deserve , ' @entity253 said .			0
