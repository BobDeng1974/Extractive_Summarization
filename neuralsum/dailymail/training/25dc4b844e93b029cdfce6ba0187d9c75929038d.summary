hundreds of ethnic @entity0 have turned out for the burial of three brave resistance fighters who died battling militants from the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the funerals of two men and a woman barely out her teens were held in the @entity11 village of @entity12 , within clear sight of the @entity16 fighters ' besieged hometown over the border in @entity18			1
the three @entity16 fighters were members of the @entity20 , or @entity20 , and died in fierce clashes in @entity5 , which has been under assault by @entity24 extremists since mid-september			0
@entity24 still surrounds the town and holds parts of it despite being forced to retreat in recent days by the brave @entity16 resistance and sustained airstrikes by a coalition of @entity32 and @entity33 warplanes			2
30 - year - old @entity42 and 25 - year - old @entity44 were laid to rest beside her , also carried by volunteers			1
in the chaos of @entity18 's multifaceted war , with a multitude of groups fighting each other as well as president @entity60 's forces , hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and it is not always possible to locate the families of those killed in fighting			1
@entity11 alone has seen an estimated 1.6 million refugees cross its borders in the four years of the @entity18 war , according to @entity69 officials			2
tragic : with her family absent , the @entity16 flag - draped coffin bearing the body of 20 - year - old @entity43 was carried to her grave yesterday by people who did n't know her but wanted to show their support bereaved : it is n't clear where the families of @entity74 , @entity42 and @entity44 were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead at one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman 's parents were on their way			1
but if they were , they never made it ' our house has been demolished in @entity5 and we are living in tents			0
... at least we can support our martyrs and we will accompany them to their graves , ' said @entity88 , one of dozens of women who turned up at the @entity12 hospital morgue for the funeral procession to the nearby cemetery			2
it was volunteers - rather than family members , as is the @entity98 tradition - who helped wash and shroud the fighters ' bodies in preparation for burial			2
' there is nobody to wash them , ' said @entity107 , 21 , who came to the morgue with a friend and offered to help			0
' there is only one doctor who can wash them , and the rest are volunteers			0
' it was n't immediately clear where the families of @entity74 , @entity42 and @entity44 were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead			1
kurdish are seen digging the graves of the three brave fighters who died at the hands of the @entity4 in @entity5 a group of @entity16 men are seen praying at the graves of the three brave resistance fighters killed fighting @entity24 in @entity5 peace : hundreds of ethnic @entity0 turned out for the burial of the three brave resistance fighters who died fighting @entity24 in @entity5 strangers : out of about 30 graves in the section of @entity12 cemetery given over to @entity0 who died fighting in @entity5 , only five of them have known families			1
nonetheless ethnic @entity0 supportive of the battle against the @entity4 mourn for those they did not know at one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman 's parents were on their way			0
but if they were , they never made it			0
yet in @entity145 's cemetery , in a part set aside for @entity0 killed across the border , they are not the only ones buried without their relatives			0
out of about 30 graves there so far , only five of them have known families , said @entity154 , one of the volunteers who helped prepare @entity43 's body for burial			1
' i do it to help			0
