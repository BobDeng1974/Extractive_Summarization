by @entity0 last updated at 9:00 pm on 21st february 2012 a @entity4 man gunned down his co-worker 's husband outside a suburban @entity8 preschool because the murder suspect believed an angel had ordered him to pull the trigger , his defence attorney argued on tuesday			1
defense attorney @entity12 said @entity13 fell so hopelessly in love with @entity15 , whom he supervised at @entity16 , that he believed he was the father of her two children and that the only way to protect them was to kill @entity21 in november 2010			1
prosecutors urged the jurors to reject the claims of delusions by @entity13 , who they said will also assert that the angel resembled @entity27 and the demon who came to him sounded like @entity31			1

' he thought @entity42 and @entity43 were his children and that @entity45 was a danger to them , ' said mr @entity12 , adding that his client was not guilty by reason of insanity because he could n't tell the difference between right and wrong during the killing			0
' i 'll boil it down to a sentence : a man wanted someone else 's wife so he killed her husband , ' said @entity60 , one of the prosecutors			2
we ask you to return a verdict that speaks the truth			0
' @entity21 was shot to death shortly after dropping his two - year - old son off at a day care centre in @entity69 , an affluent suburb north of @entity8			2
secret conversation : defendant @entity13 , left , spoke with attorney @entity71 in court last august a bearded man in a hoodie approached @entity21 , fired several shots and then hopped into a silver minivan and sped away			1
it happened so quickly that police initially believed it could have been a professional job			0
at the centre of the trial is @entity15 , who is likely to be called to testify on tuesday			2
mr @entity12 said the two shared a string of ' intimate relations ' during business trips after he hired her in early 2010 , but that she rebuffed his attempts to marry her			0
prosecutors say she rejects the allegations and that @entity13 could be hallucinating			2
@entity13 , 48 , was n't interviewed by police until six weeks after @entity21 's death after detectives discovered that shortly before the shooting he rented a minivan matching the description of a vehicle seen driving away from the crime scene			1
torn apart : @entity97 murdered after dropping his children off at daycare			0
his wife , @entity100 , was allegedly having an affair with his accused killer he faces life in prison without parole if convicted ; he 'd be turned over to the state mental health system if found not guilty			0
@entity13 had a troubled childhood and was constantly in fear of his father , a @entity110 survivor who was wracked with guilt for having survived the @entity113 death camp while 11 other relatives died			2
he eventually moved from his home in @entity116 to a boarding school in @entity118 , partly to get away from his father 's volatile behaviour			0
' it was a life of anger , it was a life filled with terror , of not knowing when or why their father would explode with rage , ' mr @entity12 said			0
he later graduated from @entity129 and bought a pricey home in a @entity132 subdivision after landing a job as a high - ranking manager at @entity16 , where he made $ 180,000 a year and supervised 5,000 engineers and an $ 800million budget , prosecutors said			0
denial : @entity15 says her husband 's killer was merely a ' family friend ' @entity13 hired @entity15 in early 2010 after she decided she needed to earn more money because her husband , a 36 - year - old @entity143 - trained entrepreneur , was having trouble finding steady work , attorneys said			1
they soon hit it off , and on work trips they would share long dinners , wine and occasionally romance , @entity13 's defence team contends			2
prosecutors say @entity13 began meticulously planning @entity21 's killing after she rebuffed one of his advances			1
they say he bought a gun , took it to target practice and then on november 10 camped outside @entity15 's house to try to kill him			1
he bolted when @entity15 , who could n't recognize @entity13 , startled him , they say			1
nine days later , prosecutors say , @entity13 arrived at his office earlier than usual - at 5:36 a.m. - and then sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and give himself an alibi			2
he then drove to the @entity167 day care centre , shot @entity15 four times and hopped in the minivan and tried to melt into morning rush traffic , they say			0
@entity13 was so callous about his actions that he returned to work a few hours later and participated in the religious ceremonies of his victim 's death , including the @entity176 ritual of shovelling dirt on @entity15 's grave at his funeral , mr @entity60 said			1
mr @entity12 asked the jurors to pay careful attention to phone records between @entity13 and @entity15 , noting that the two exchanged three calls on the night before the shooting and that she called him six times in the hours after her husband was killed			1
he also said his arguments that his client could n't tell the difference between right and wrong during the killing are backed by evaluations from psychiatrists and mental health experts who diagnosed @entity13 as bipolar and concluded he had a delusional disorder			0
' this case is not about what happened			0
we know what happened , ' mr @entity12 said			0
