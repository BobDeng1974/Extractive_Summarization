by @entity0 pictures of prince @entity2 in his new role as president of the @entity5 demonstrated two things very clearly			1
first , that @entity7 knows one end of a snorkel from the other , and second , that he has n’t done anything about his rapid hair loss			1
in common with around three in ten men of his age , 32 - year - old @entity2 suffers from male pattern baldness ( @entity16 ) and those pictures of him emerging from a swimming pool with the little hair he has left plastered to his head served to highlight the problem			1
it happens when dihydrotestosterone ( @entity33 ) — a hormone formed when the body metabolises testerosterone — causes hair follicles at the front and top of the head to shrink , producing finer hairs and , eventually , no hair at all			1
hair follicles at the back and sides of the head , however , do not have @entity33 receptors , meaning @entity16 tends to leave sufferers with the classic horseshoe of hair			1
it is also a hereditary condition and with his father , grandfathers and uncles all balding , it was always likely that @entity2 would follow suit			1
hopefully , he wo n’t be tempted to use prince @entity58 ’s solution — the comb - over			1
not only does it fail to disguise the royal bald spot , it has a habit of blowing around in high winds to create an alarming spiky halo			2
if @entity2 wants to tackle his baldness there are many remedies on offer , from homespun to high - tech. here , the country ’s leading hair loss experts explain which might work for @entity2 ... @entity73 , garlic , coconut , henna , egg , tomato ketchup , fabric softener , banana , artificial sweetener			1
you name it , someone has suggested it as a cure for hair loss			1
@entity88 once let it be known that he maintained those famous white locks by washing his hair in beer			1
home grown remedy : could a clove of garlic , a fried egg , or a slice of coconut be @entity100 ' answer ? the verdict : dr @entity102 of @entity104 ’s @entity103 is a leading hair transplant surgeon who has worked with high - profile clients including @entity109 footballers			1
he says : ‘ there is some evidence to suggest that henna helps to moisturise hair and will therefore improve its appearance , but it will have no effect on baldness and , i ’m afraid , neither will any of these other home remedies			1
‘ they may make the hair you have look slightly fuller for a day or two — as is the case with beer which leaves a residue of hops and barley as it evaporates — but they will have absolutely no impact on actual hair loss			1
’ the theory behind this one is that it increases blood supply to the scalp , which prevents the shrinkage of the hair follicles associated with balding			1
all of our experts say they have come across patients using this technique and an even more extreme form of the same idea — the headstand			1
back in the @entity145 , @entity144 ’s receding goalkeeper @entity143 also promoted an inversion machine that he believed would help			2
natural approach : massaging the scalp opens the hair follicles and increases the blood flow , inducing hair growth the verdict : @entity153 , one of the directors of hair loss clinic @entity156 , says : ‘ you can see why men think scalp massages , headstands , handstands and the like will work because minoxidil , one of the medications that does work for hair loss , also increases blood flow to the scalp			1
it is what we call a vasodilator — or something that widens blood vessels			2
’ in fact , minoxidil was first developed as a medication for high blood pressure , until researchers noticed it also thickened the hair			1
‘ however , ’ continues @entity153 , ‘ just because one vasodilator works with male pattern baldness does n’t mean they all do			1
so no , these techniques wo n’t work			0
’ there are two options here with countless studies supporting each			0
all hair loss experts agree that both medications work , although results vary depending on the individual			1
the first is finasteride , an oral medication with the trade name @entity197			0
the second is minoxidil , a topical medication with the trade name @entity202			0
neither is available on the @entity204			0
some clinics prescribe their own preparations and also use the two medications in combination			0
both will stop working if you stop taking them so it would have to be a lifelong commitment if you plan to keep your hair			1
effective : experts claim drug programmes are highly effective , but it is a life - long commitment the verdict : dr @entity102 explains that while @entity197 ( in use since the late @entity225 ) is roughly twice as effective at halting male pattern baldness , it can also ( in around two per cent of men ) cause side - effects , which include loss of libido , anxiety and depression			1
@entity197 is a prescription - only medication , which acts as a @entity33 inhibitor , thereby halting the detrimental effect of the hormone on hair follicles			1
minoxidil — on the market as an anti-hair loss product since the @entity145 — is less effective , but has milder side - effects			0
the exact mechanism by which it works is n’t fully understood , but it does help retain hair and slow the thinning process			2
it can not be used on areas that are completely bald			0
as with @entity197 , the medication works only when used continuously			0
@entity153 estimates that the average man coming to @entity156 for medication can expect to spend between £ 150 and £ 350 every three months on treatment			0
whether you opt for the space - age @entity250 ( £ 665 ) or a slightly less futuristic ‘ laser comb ’ ( around £ 300 ) , the principle is the same			0
manufacturers claim these low - level laser therapies ( @entity255 ) will re-energise and strengthen cells in the hair follicles , combating hair loss			2
both are suitable for use at home			0
hitting the market in 2013 , the @entity262 is a helmet ( which even plays music while you use it ) filled with red laser and led light diodes			0
according to a study published by the @entity271 , when used every other day for about four months , the treatment will increase hair growth by up to 40 per cent			2
laser combs have been around longer , but work on the same principle			0
manufacturers claim high success rates with them , but experts say study groups are too small to be useful and focus on how men ‘ feel ’ about their hair , not on scientific measurements			1
laser treatment : could this @entity262 laser helmet be the key to sorting out @entity100 ' hereditary male pattern baldness the verdict : dr @entity102 ( along with most leading experts ) is very sceptical that this approach will work without one of the proven anti-hair loss medications being used at the same time			1
‘ there are no convincing studies on this , ’ he says , ‘ even though it has been being explored for some time			0
@entity255 is a safe form of light treatment , but have i seen evidence that it combats male pattern balding ? no. ’ a hair transplant is the only way to permanently fix a completely bald spot			1
medication is prescribed to maximise hair coverage before a transplant is performed			2
celebrity move : many have suggested @entity100 should follow @entity310 's lead by getting a transplant the verdict : leading hair transplant surgeon dr @entity313 explains : ‘ one method is to take a thin block of skin from the back of the head ( which contains many hair roots ) and then have a team of technicians present in the theatre to isolate individual hair roots ( surrounded by a small bit of skin — referred to as a graft ) which the surgeon implants into the bald area one at a time			2
this is @entity330 , or fut			0
‘ alternatively hair is shaved and a very fine boring tool used to extract roots individually from the back of the head			2
this is referred to as @entity335 , or @entity335			0
’ the most suitable method , says dr @entity313 , depends on habits of the man having the transplant			0
@entity330 can be performed in a day , but will leave a scar at the back of the head ( which may prevent the patient shaving his head in the future ) while @entity335 leaves no scars , but takes longer ( around two days ) and involves shaving the back of the head initially ( in other words it wo n’t work for a high - flying executive who has to be back in the office the next day )			0
both procedures are performed using a sedative and local anesthetic			0
men who have had the surgery describe it as uncomfortable rather than painful			0
guideline prices are £ 2 to £ 2.50 per graft			0
this can give a starting price of around £ 5,000 , stretching up to £ 20,000 for more extensive work			0
dr @entity313 and dr @entity102 agree that not everyone is a suitable candidate for transplant			0
neither surgeon will accept men below 30 because hair loss patterns are unpredictable and expectations often unrealistic			2
they are also reluctant to work on the very elderly as hair thins naturally , regardless of @entity16 , and if there is n’t enough hair at the back of the head to get good quality grafts			2
clinical trials are already underway			0
the dream is that scientists could use stem cells to generate new hair follicles in the laboratory			1
they ’d still have to be implanted , but they would n’t have to be removed from another part of the scalp			0
however , there are still multiple problems to be overcome			0
follicles are complicated to generate ( hence expensive ) and the body is prone to reject large numbers of them			0
the verdict : dr @entity102 says that , at the moment , rejection of cloned hair grafts is a major problem , which can be solved only with anti-rejection drugs ( of the type used in organ transplants )			1
the risks associated with taking these drugs would not be worth it for a cosmetic procedure			2
he believes that any kind of meaningful new development for treating baldness is at least a decade away .			2

@entity2 , 32 , suffers from male pattern baldness like @entity58 and @entity405
images of him emerging from pool reveal the *severity* of the problem
experts suggest drugs , hair transplants and stem cell therapy to cure it
