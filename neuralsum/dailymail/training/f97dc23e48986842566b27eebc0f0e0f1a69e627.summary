by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 19:14 est , 12 june 2012 flying just got more expensive for most @entity2 passengers wishing to jet internationally			1
those checking a second back on the airline will have to hand over an additional $ 100 , up from $ 50 just one year ago			1
but @entity2 is just one of many taking away the complementary checked baggage			1
@entity9 announced in january that it was raising its fees from $ 75 to $ 100 as well			1
excess baggage : while the first checked bag is still free , the fees have steadily risen for the second , and doubled in the case of @entity2 high - flying headache : @entity2 is raising fees for a second checked bag on some international flights $ 100 , citing rising fuel and handling costs ' @entity2 ’s international customers will continue to be able to check in their first bag free of charge			1
this change reflects an increase in costs associated with carrying bags such as fuel and handling ' @entity23 , a spokesperson for @entity2 , told the @entity30 on tuesday			2
this is the second such price increase in two years , when @entity2 raised its fee between the @entity33 and @entity34 $ 20 , from $ 50 to $ 70			1
airline analyst @entity35 said that despite the $ 30 increase , the airline should only expect ‘ modest ’ profits – around $ 30million			1
he said that it is likely the rest of the major carriers within the @entity33 will follow suite and increase prices to match			2
@entity43 and @entity44 charge $ 70 and $ 60 for second bags checked on international flights , respectively , according to @entity47			1
the additional charges usually fall on leisure travellers , who do not belong to a business or preferred flier program			0
summer of discontent : members of the @entity55 picket the @entity2 shareholders meeting , in @entity57 today ; they say they have been working two years without a contract falling in line : @entity9 hiked their second bag fee to $ 100 in january across the board : @entity2 has increased its fees for @entity34 , the @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 , but not for other points of flight in addition , many passengers are able to circumvent baggage fees by simply modifying their behaviour			1
those going on shorter trips can eke by with the standard one bag , one personal item as carry - ons , though certain airlines are stingier than others with space requirements and airplane size			0
but the alarming rise in baggage fees may have more capitalistic origins			0
@entity86 ’s @entity85 writer @entity84 believes that the prices are almost opportunistic , and will bank on the @entity33 tourist rush to the @entity89 as prices make travel more appealing			2
' considering the economic turmoil in @entity34 , you might think that the airline would consider putting fewer financial obstacles in the way of @entity33 taking a trans - @entity97 flight to the @entity98 , ' he said			1
not even declining jet fuel prices halted the move			0
' mr @entity84 added that many @entity33 families will be heading across the @entity97 because the @entity33 dollar is relatively strong			2
@entity43 did not immediately return @entity30 's request for comment on the fare hike			0
this year , airline profits are forecasted around $ 3billion , a wafer thin margin of just 0.5 per cent on projected revenues of $ 631 billion , according to the @entity110			0
while airlines can make more money from selling extras , it also means more travellers are getting squeezed as they 're forced to pay for things that used to come with the ticket such as seat assignments			0
@entity33 airlines , for example , are setting aside more economy seats requiring an extra fee because they come with more legroom or are closer to the front			2
the extra revenue from add - ons such as seat assignments and priority check - in could total $ 30 - $ 60billion over the next five years , according to @entity110			0
passengers took to social media to express their unhappiness			0
one @entity133 user wrote : ' now @entity2 is on my ' @entity135 ' list , along with @entity137			0
' another said : ' we need a new airline term for " highway robbery			0

@entity2 upped fee for second checked bag from $ 70 to $ 100 on flights from the @entity33 to @entity64 , @entity34 , @entity65 , and the @entity63
@entity9 raised second bag fees in january from $ 75 to $ 100
analyst predicts fee increase will yield ' modest ' profit of $ 30m
