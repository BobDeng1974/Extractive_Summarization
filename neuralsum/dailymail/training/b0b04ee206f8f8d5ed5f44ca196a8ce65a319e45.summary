by @entity0 a cemetery where bodies were buried in the wrong place , plots mis - sold and graves illegally opened was callously referred to as a ‘ @entity6 ’ by local councillors , @entity4 can reveal			1
the most shocking mix - up in a catalogue of blunders resulted in grieving parents learning that for months they had been leaving flowers on the wrong grave			1
@entity14 and @entity15 discovered to their dismay that their son @entity18 had not been buried in the plot they had bought for him but in a grave nearby , while his headstone had been mistakenly erected at a third site			1
painful : @entity24 , pictured , leaves flowers at his son @entity26 a new investigation by council officials into the idyllic @entity29 in @entity30 has found other alarming examples of incompetence , including : the @entity33 said they had bought a specific plot for their severely disabled son , who died aged 27 in 1994 , partly because they had also been able to purchase the one next - door so they could eventually be buried alongside him			1
mix up : the cemetery sign at @entity29 in @entity30 but the couple were unexpectedly summoned to the cemetery about six months after their son ’s death and told there had been a shocking mix - up			1
they were shown their son ’s actual grave , which had been opened up without the required legal licence , and asked to check the coffin ’s nameplate , which they verified was @entity18 ’s			1
the burying of ‘ poor ’ children in mass graves was once commonplace			2
although now shocking , it remains legal and there have been frequent calls to ban the practice			0
the payment of even a token fee would ensure parents know where their child is interred so that they can later erect a memorial , however simple			0
the couple said that not only was their son in a different plot from the one they had officially purchased , but the confusion meant they could no longer be buried alongside the son they had devoted their lives to			2
to add insult to injury , they learned @entity18 ’s headstone had been wrongly placed at yet another grave , occupied by a woman ’s body , and had to be moved to their son ’s plot			1
mrs @entity15 , 71 , a retired cleaner , said : ‘ when i went up there , i had to walk away			2
it was his coffin but it was not in the plot we had bought			0
it felt like @entity18 was still not at rest			0
‘ we had bought the plots to be side by side but it turned out those plots we bought were already occupied and the space he is in only has room for us at the foot of it			0
’ her husband , 72 , a former electricity worker , said : ‘ it has been very painful for my wife especially			0
‘ it was nothing sinister , just someone who had taken on too much and could n’t cope with all the different responsibilities			0
’ an examination of the cemetery ’s records , which were in a chaotic state , has found that several other people were listed as being buried in the wrong plots , and gravestones erected at the wrong sites			1
tragic : @entity29 's unmarked child graves the council ’s inquiry also discovered that 42 babies and young children had been buried up to the 1970s in mass ‘ public ’ graves where no record was taken of exactly where the body lay – a practice still used in some cemeteries			1
the graveyard ’s chaotic past has only now been cleared up , after the appointment of a new official , and the parish council last week discussed issuing a public apology			0
in a statement , new @entity133 parish council chairman @entity132 said : ‘ there have been serious issues			0
' people have been interred in the wrong graves , headstones wrongly placed and registers have been altered			2
@entity14 and @entity15 ’s disabled son @entity18 , 27 , died in 1994 , and his parents bought two plots @entity144 , numbered 465 and 464 for him and ( a double ) for themselves in @entity29 , @entity30			1
but because of chaotic record - keeping , plot 465 already had a body in it and , in any case , @entity18 was erroneously interred in plot 468			1
@entity14 and @entity15 with @entity18 , bottom right , and older son @entity152 though the @entity33 put flowers on 465 , they were soon told by another mourner they were mistaken			1
a headstone for @entity18 was then somehow wrongly placed at plot 482 , but later moved to where @entity18 actually was			2
the @entity33 were summoned to the cemetery to find grave 468 had been illegally opened so that the coffin nameplate of their son could be verified			2
' a grave was opened without a precautionary licence and without notice a family member asked to attend			0
‘ records exist verifying the council was aware of the situation ; it was also sometimes referred to at meetings and in the registers as the “ @entity6 ”			0
‘ this disrespectful term has now been removed from the records wherever possible			0
