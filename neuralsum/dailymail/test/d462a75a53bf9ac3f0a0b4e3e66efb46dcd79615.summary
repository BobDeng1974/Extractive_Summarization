researchers in the @entity3 examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40			1
half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast , lunch and dinner over 12 days , while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame			1
the volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks , including fruit juice , outside these times			0
before and after the study period , the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent mri scans to measure the response of their brains to stress			2
saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol , which is made by the adrenal glands			0
the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks			1
dr @entity49 , one of the researchers at the @entity51 , said : ‘ this is the first evidence that high sugar consumption – but not aspartame – may relieve stress in humans			1
