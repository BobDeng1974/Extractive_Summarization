@entity0 stirred @entity2 emotions and rekindled misty - eyed memories of @entity4 as he scored a @entity6 penalty to celebrate his first goal since returning to @entity8			1
his first since the winning spot - kick against @entity10 in the @entity11 in may 2012 was the second in this six - goal euro - romp against @entity14			1
@entity16 ’s team are in control at the top of @entity19 , smoothly on course for a place in the last 16 of the @entity6			0
@entity21 put @entity2 ahead after 13 minutes after cutting in from the right hand side and firing past @entity23 @entity0 made it 2 - 0 from the penalty spot after @entity26 was harshly adjudged to have committed a foul as the ball hit his hand @entity30 arrived in the box to make it three on the half hour , although replays showed that the @entity2 skipper was in fact offside @entity37 's ball across the goal line was turned into the net by an unfortunate @entity40 after brilliant play from @entity42 @entity37 tucks away @entity2 's fifth goal from a penalty after @entity45 had been brought down in the area hazard escapes the @entity14 defence again to add a sixth goal in the final minute , as the visitors collapsed against a dominant @entity2 @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 6.5 , @entity30 7 , @entity42 7 , @entity53 7 ( @entity54 60 , 6 ) , @entity55 7 , @entity37 7.5 , @entity56 7 , @entity57 7 , @entity58 ( @entity0 16 , 6.5 ) subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			1
manager : @entity16 7 goals : @entity21 13 , @entity0 23 ( pen ) , @entity30 31 , @entity40 54 ( og ) , @entity37 77 ( pen ) , 90 @entity14 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity23 5 , @entity70 5 , @entity71 5 , @entity72 5 , @entity40 5 ( @entity73 56 , 5 ) , @entity74 6 , @entity26 5 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 5 , @entity77 5 , @entity78 5 subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85			1
manager : @entity87 5 referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) 6.5 they are unbeaten in 12 games this season , have scored 33 goals and @entity37 is in electrifying form			2
yet , as supporters wallowed in the nostalgia and goose - pimpled with excitement at the prospect of the season ahead , they and @entity16 must have been wondering quietly about the collateral damage			2
@entity0 was only on the pitch because @entity21 had hurt his groin scoring the first of the night and @entity21 was only starting because @entity106 was absent with his hamstring problems			1
these inconveniences did nothing to stop them outclassing the champions of @entity111			0
@entity30 scored a remarkable third , there was an own - goal , @entity14 missed a penalty and @entity37 grabbed two late on , his first from another spot - kick			1
there was no shortage of incident and with the points safe , thoughts turned to @entity123 on sunday , and @entity16 ’s mounting problems			0
he also has @entity63 suspended , after his red card at @entity126			0
@entity53 came off with 30 minutes remaining to preserve his energy and @entity2 ended with three teenagers on the pitch , including striker @entity64 , making his debut			2
@entity16 had also rested @entity60 and @entity62			0
ahead of the game , @entity16 had been at pains to avoid complacency and @entity14 , who took points from @entity136 and @entity137 , produced an early warning when @entity76 found space between @entity30 and @entity52 and headed over			1
@entity57 takes on @entity14 's @entity140 as @entity2 attempted to consolidate their position at the top of @entity19 @entity56 attempts an ambitious bicycle kick under pressure from @entity14 's @entity72 , leading to @entity2 appeals for an early penalty @entity55 keeps an eye on @entity77 as @entity14 started reasonably brightly at @entity8 before being swept aside @entity21 stretches for the ball inside the @entity14 box , and the @entity151 striker appeared to pick up an injury shortly before he scored from here , @entity2 took a grip and had killed the game by half - time			1
@entity157 came @entity21 ’s goal , followed by his injury			2
@entity30 split the @entity14 defence and @entity21 fired low into the corner			1
as he moved away to celebrate the goal , he winced and pulled up			0
he must have warned @entity16 about the problem because @entity0 was already warming up			0
after hobbling on for two minutes , @entity21 came off and went straight down the tunnel			2
he must have been devastated			0
after moving from @entity166 and waiting patiently for his chance , here it came and went and on came @entity0 , to seize the script with a goal and a performance which was a considerable improvement on his only start of the season , against @entity136			2
@entity57 won the spot - kick when he jinked into the box and jabbed a pass which clearly struck @entity26 on the hand			0
@entity26 seemed justified to complain that the ball had been struck from only a yard away and he had no chance to adjust , but the argument was lost			0
@entity182 referee @entity89 pointed to the spot , and @entity37 gave @entity0 the honour			1
“ i was surprised and i was n’t particularly pleased , ” said @entity16			0
“ i have my choices and @entity37 is number one			0
” @entity0 made it easier for the manager to accept by stepping up and with a sense of history scored his 158th @entity2 goal , sweeping the ball into the same corner as the penalty he scored to win the @entity6 shoot - out , with his last kick before leaving for @entity197			1
@entity2 's first goal was pure simplicity as @entity30 fed @entity21			1
click here for more from our brilliant @entity201 @entity21 's strike from the edge of the box put @entity2 1 - 0 up , but the @entity151 forward aggravated the injury to his groin in the process as his @entity2 team - mates celebrate , @entity21 is left clutching at his troublesome groin , and was replaced soon after @entity21 's injury could pose a serious problem for @entity2 , who go to @entity123 next week with @entity106 already a doubt it was far from an electric atmosphere at the bridge for what always seemed likely to be a routine group game but this was a popular moment , greeted with an enormous cheer			1
@entity0 is the club ’s top @entity222 goalscorer and this was his 35th			0
@entity30 ’s first of the season was nearly as popular			0
@entity2 had been defending a corner when a @entity0 clearance sparked a counter-attack and the captain put his head down and ran			1
@entity37 carried the ball to the edge of the @entity14 penalty area , rolled in @entity53 on the overlap and his low cross was met at the back - post by @entity30 , who had made a 100 - yard dash to convert , sliding in on the seat of his pants			1
he was a fraction offside , but there was no flag			0
the second half belonged to @entity37 , although the @entity245 winger began it with a couple of fluffed chances			2
he linked up neatly with @entity0 only to stumble over the ball as he manoeuvred it out of his feet to shoot , with only the goalkeeper to beat			0
@entity37 was a constant threat to the @entity14 defence , as @entity2 began to show a level of dominance at @entity8 @entity78 runs away from @entity55 towards the @entity2 defence , but the home side were rarely troubled after taking the lead @entity0 slots home a penalty to put @entity2 two goals ahead after the referee decided @entity26 's handball was deliberate the @entity2 legend acknowledges his team - mates after doubling the home side 's lead and all but ending @entity14 's resistance @entity0 is a firm favourite with the @entity8 faithful and they were delighted with his first competitive goal since his return @entity30 slides in to touch the ball into an unguarded net as @entity2 ended the game as a contest before half time @entity30 looked delighted , but somewhat surprised , to find himself arriving alone in the six - yard box at the end of a @entity2 attack @entity30 celebrates with his team - mates and @entity2 were showboating before half time , with @entity14 unable to cope with their quality @entity37 's cut - back was inadvertently turned in by @entity40 as @entity2 continued to dominate in the second half @entity77 sees his penalty strike the base of the post after @entity55 had conceded a penalty to offer @entity14 a small ray of hope he squandered another chance at the back - post as he reached a low cross zipped in from the left by @entity42 but , as he turned the ball back across goal , it was deflected into the net by @entity14 left - back @entity40			1
the @entity111 had the chance to pull one back from the spot when @entity55 bundled into @entity299 and sent him sprawling in the penalty area			2
@entity299 picked himself to take the kick himself and it seemed for a split - second as if @entity51 was about to continue the @entity4 theme			0
the @entity306 ‘ keeper , demoted this season to @entity308 behind @entity60 , had saved three in that @entity6 final , but this one flashed past his dive , smacked into the post and flew out			0
@entity57 rattled the woodwork before @entity37 finally found the target , which the goals his dazzling skills deserved			2
this time he took responsibility from the spot , stepping up to score after @entity45 had tumbled theatrically , @entity37 added his second and his team ’s sixth as the clock ticked past 90 minutes			1
a win in @entity14 in a fortnight and @entity2 will be within touching distance of the knock - out rounds with two games to spare			2
first , that trip to @entity123 , where @entity16 ’s mentor @entity327 will attempt to throw a spanner in the works of this blue machine			0
@entity16 had the opportunity to introduce some of his younger squad players , with @entity54 replacing @entity53 @entity45 goes down under the challenge of @entity72 , leading referee @entity89 to point to the spot for a third time @entity37 stepped up to convert @entity2 's second penalty , as @entity2 continued to pile on the misery for the @entity111 champions @entity23 was sent the wrong way by @entity37 as @entity2 ran riot at @entity8 against opponents who looked all at sea @entity37 steps away from the @entity14 defence on his way to adding a late sixth goal for @entity2 the @entity245 celebrates as @entity2 recorded their largest @entity6 win video we are playing with confidence - @entity16			1
