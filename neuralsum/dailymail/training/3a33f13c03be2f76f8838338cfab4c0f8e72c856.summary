this is the moment a thrill - seeking motorcyclist was given a stern talking - to by a mounted policeman after pulling a wheelie at 60mph in central @entity4			1
revving the engine of his @entity7 , the unnamed driver filmed himself speeding along the @entity8 with a @entity9 , attached to his helmet , before raising his front wheel with the speedometer in clear view			1
his antics were brought to an abrupt halt by two mounted policeman , one of whom insisted he record the telling - off as a warning to other motorists			2
the driver films himself performing a wheelie at 67mph on a central @entity4 road			2
unbeknownst to him , two mounted police officers lie in wait ahead on approach to the two uniformed officers , one can be heard telling the driver to turn off his motorcycle 's roaring engine			1
' why do you think you 've been stopped ? ' the officer asks , to which the unnamed motorcyclist replies in a foreign accent : ' because my wheel went a bit up ? ' ' you 're pulling a wheelie and recording it on that ( pointing to the driver 's helmet )			1
' you 're in a 20mph speed limit			0
' claiming he was travelling at 22mph maximum , the driver is then quietened by the officer , a motorcyclist himself			2
' i do n't think so			0
' do n't give me any of your old flannel			0
i ride motorbikes , i know what they 're capable of			0
after performing the dangerous stunt the driver slows down when he sees the two policemen on the road the unsuspecting driver is told to switch off his engine before being given a stern talking - to by the police ' that 's dangerous riding			1
' is this still being recorded now ? leave it on , you can show your friends the big telling off you got from the policeman on the horse for clowning around			2
' you 're going to kill someone else as well as yourself you know			0
' if a traffic officer saw that he 'd seize that camera , bag it up as evidence and you 'd be losing your licence			0
' do i make myself clear ? i 'm a motorcyclist myself , i know how fast they are so do n't give me any of your old flannel			0
' get out of the @entity81 and do n't come back			0
