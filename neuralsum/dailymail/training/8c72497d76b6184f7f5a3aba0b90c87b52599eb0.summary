@entity1 ( pictured in a folio from one of the oldest extant @entity25 manuscripts in @entity13 ) was actually written by @entity3 's mother @entity2 - making it the first female book in the @entity6 , a @entity21 historian has claimed dr @entity7 , who also works as a gp and lives in @entity30 , @entity21 , claims @entity12 needed to find out who @entity3 was and turned to the one person who would know , @entity3 's elderly mother @entity2			1
his claims emerge in the most sacred week of the @entity35 calendar , @entity34 , when believers reflect on the days leading up to @entity3 ' crucifixion			2
the amateur historian said : ' key information about @entity3 ' birth and childhood in the @entity1 could only have come from @entity2 "			2
' as she was the only surviving eye - witness of those events when @entity12 was writing			0
' records at that time were almost exclusively male , yet @entity12 's manuscript is overwhelmingly female , and his early information was witnessed by one person and one person only , @entity2 , the mother of @entity3			2
dr @entity7 , from @entity30 , claims @entity12 needed to find out who @entity3 was and turned to the one person who would know , @entity3 ' elderly mother @entity2			1
pictured is a tapestry in @entity18 depicting @entity2 and the baby jesus the @entity1 is the third and longest of the four @entity54			0
the gospel provides an account of the life of @entity3 , from his birth to his ascension			0
the preface states that the reason behind the gospel is to provide an historical account , while bringing out the theological significance of the history			0
dr @entity7 believes the document people have come to know as the @entity1 began life as a legal defence document in a trial			1
@entity12 , a @entity13 physician , was tasked with writing a letter of support for @entity16 who was imprisoned in @entity18 for the political crime of supporting @entity3 , he said			1
' all of the other players were long since dead			0
' only @entity2 had the knowledge and only @entity1 provides them			0
' @entity12 , a @entity77 physician , must have gone to the mother of @entity3			2
' dr @entity7 drew his conclusions after studying and comparing the original @entity13 and @entity82 scriptures			1
in his book , ' @entity1 - as told by @entity2 ' , he claims that the number of feminine words contained in the scripture give away the true author			1
the doctor , who runs an @entity90 practice in inner - city @entity21 , added that the writing also suggests @entity2 was far from being an uneducated peasant girl and was instead well - educated			0
' of the @entity1 biographies of @entity3 , @entity12 's stands head and shoulders above the others in terms of feminine references , ' he said			2
' while the @entity99 has a feminine word content totaling 116 , @entity12 has more than double that at 247			1
@entity12 ( pictured here in a stained glass window in @entity103 , @entity104 ) was tasked with writing a letter of support for @entity16 who was imprisoned in @entity18 for the political crime of supporting @entity3 , claims dr @entity7 ' @entity12 was being informed by a woman , and given the number of " widow " references - nine as compared to @entity114 's none - most likely a woman who had been widowed			1
' ' @entity12 's opening content points to one widow in particular , @entity2 , the wife of @entity117 and mother of @entity3			1
' far from being an uneducated peasant girl , dr @entity7 's analysis of @entity2 's song " @entity122 " in the original @entity13 manuscript reveals separate quotations from each section of the @entity6 of her day , numbering ten in total , showing that she had , unusually for the time , been well - educated			1
' his newest book follows on from his revolutionary claims that @entity3 was the son of a middle - class , highly educated architect , disputing the previous theory he worked as a carpenter			0
dr @entity134 added : ' the first - century was a male - dominated world			0
my aim is to give @entity2 the credit she deserves			0
without her @entity12 would have had much less of a story to tell			0
' it 's a somewhat different version of the greatest story ever told			0
rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father , @entity3 was actually the son of a successful , middle - class and highly intellectual architect			0
the claim comes from biblical scholar dr @entity7 , who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so - called ' missing years ' of @entity3 's life , when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest - ranking rabbi in @entity152			1
the radical revision of @entity35 history would suggest that , in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life , @entity3 may have been speaking from experience			0
dr @entity7 has analysed the @entity6 's original @entity13 and @entity82 scriptures to try to establish the truth about @entity163 's background			2
he says a mistranslation of the @entity13 word ' tekton ' to describe the profession of @entity117 , @entity3 's father , is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of @entity163 's character			2
dr @entity7 claims that while ' tekton ' is usually said to mean carpenter , it more accurately means master builder or architect			2
as an architect , @entity117 would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son .			0

he says it was written by @entity12 , a @entity13 physician , as a letter of support for @entity16 who was imprisoned for the political crime of supporting @entity3
details about @entity3 ' childhood could only have come from @entity2 , he claims

while the @entity99 has a feminine word content totalling 116 , @entity12 has more than double that at 247
