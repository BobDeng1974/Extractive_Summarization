the allegations , which @entity11 denies , were included in a court filing made late last week by the attorney representing @entity15 who was fired from her job			1

@entity15 also said @entity49 was living at @entity11 's home and at one point she was ordered by @entity49 to find adjoining hotel rooms for the pair when they traveled			1

sensational : @entity15 , 48 , was fired from her job and is on trial for giving an illegally taped phone conversation to a newspaper the agent told her to not do it again , @entity15 said , but did not explain why			1
lieutenant - governor @entity11 , a former @entity68 officer who is also a mother - of - three , said the allegations are all lies			1
' that 's totally false and absurd , ' said @entity11 , a former @entity73 legislator who was chosen by @entity23 as his running mate in 2010			2
@entity11 said the allegations are an attempt by @entity15 and her attorney to get the criminal charges against @entity15 dropped			1

he said the filing was made to show that @entity11 , @entity49 and @entity11 's chief - of - staff , @entity106 , have reasons to make @entity15 look bad because they could be witnesses at @entity15 's trial			1
mr @entity94 added : ' it 's a desperate prosecution that is politically motivated			0
' the attorney works for the law firm of @entity113 , who has clashed with governor @entity23 in the past			0
he filed a lawsuit during the 2010 campaign attempting to obtain a video deposition @entity23 had given in a case against a chain of health clinics he helped start			0
political power : lt. governor @entity3 ( with governor @entity23 ) allegedly had a relationship with a female aide the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) investigation that resulted in @entity15 's arrest began last september after the agency received a complaint that a secret audio recording had been made in @entity11 's office			1
the agency reported its findings to prosecutor @entity134 , the state attorney for the @entity95 area			0
it is against @entity4 law to record someone without consent , but there have been legal questions about recordings made in public buildings			2

the woman is facing a third - degree felony charge			0

@entity11 denied this ever happened			0
@entity15 was fired about the time the investigation began after publicly speaking out about infighting in @entity11 's office			1
a sworn statement by an @entity125 agent said that investigators looked into @entity15 's emails and cellphone records and discovered that she had sent the recording to the @entity145 reporter			2
@entity106 , who said the recording was made without his permission , told investigators it was made sometime between june and august 2011			0
he said he was working with @entity15 on @entity11 's website			1
but @entity15 's attorney maintained in his filing with the court that recording went on all the time in the lieutenant governor 's office and that @entity23 's communications teams instructed staff members to ' covertly ' record conversations in the office , especially with members of the press for accuracy			1
they also maintain that @entity106 joked about having a ' smart pen ' that could record conversations without anyone knowing about it			0
when reached by email , @entity106 said he could not comment on the case and directed questions to @entity23 's press office			0

' the woman is facing a third - degree felony charge , ' @entity205 said			0
' her allegations should be considered in that light			0
' attorney @entity94 made the court filing after @entity134 ' office filed a motion to keep confidential two documents that the defense wanted to use - a one - page report summarizing a polygraph test given to @entity15 where she talked about @entity11 and @entity49 and an @entity125 report regarding the trash can fire in @entity11 's office			1
the prosecutor on the case would not comment about the motion			0
the official filing stated that the documents should be kept confidential in order to protect a ' compelling government interest ' and to avoid harming third parties			0
the state 's motion also contended the documents were irrelevant but could pose a threat to @entity15 receiving a fair trial because they would generate media interest			1
a judge held a hearing last friday where he ruled that the polygraph report would be kept confidential but the @entity125 report would remain public			0
that report details a march 17 incident where @entity49 threw a cigar into @entity15 's trashcan			2
the cigar started a fire that was put out by another employee			0
@entity49 told an @entity125 investigator that she had taken a couple of puffs on the cigar at a @entity253 , put it out and wrapped it up in a paper towel and returned with it to her office at the @entity4 @entity257			2
she then put it in @entity15 's trashcan			2
the @entity125 investigator concluded it was an accident , but @entity15 's attorney questioned the account , noting that both a cigar and a match were found in the trash can after the fire .			2
