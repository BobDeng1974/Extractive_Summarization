by @entity1 reporter published : 11:06 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 25 october 2013 @entity4 fans of the @entity6 films may think they have seen every frame and heard every word from the six - part saga , but as @entity10 would say : ' @entity11 , they are			1
' a segment of the 1983 film @entity13 has been discovered , which has around 30 minutes of unreleased footage - including outtakes , alternate takes and behind - the - scenes direction			2
the ' lost ' footage turned up on a @entity20 , a large - format forerunner of the dvd , and contains an early take of a scene on @entity10 's home planet in the @entity26 system			1
a long - lost disc , from a technology far far away : the laserdisc with printed label that shows it 's a @entity33 - designed @entity32 demo of scene 50 from @entity13 @entity34 has returned to finish his @entity36 training , but he finds a physically weakened @entity10 , who complains about his age and ill - health			1
suddenly , indignant at the thought that a young @entity34 may be mocking him because of his age , @entity10 delivers the now - famous line : ' when 900 years you reach , look as good you will not			1
' the rough take shows how @entity45 creator and the voice of @entity10 - developed the unique phrasing and vocal range of the little green @entity36 master			2
another minute - long clip from the @entity20 shows @entity34 's faithful droid @entity51 repairing an @entity55 fighter - both machines looking decidedly out of place on the overgrown @entity26 surface			1
both clips have been put up on a special @entity60 page , and more footage is promised in the near future			2
in the 1980s , @entity6 creator @entity63 and his team at @entity33 devised the @entity32 editing system for film and television , which used the @entity20 technology			0
instead of printing daily takes on film stock , processed negatives from the camera would be mastered onto @entity20 , similar to burning dvds today			0
it made it much easier to select takes and set up a rough edit for the negative cutter , who would then use the directions from the @entity20 to cut the camera negative and assemble the finished film			0
missing edit : a still from the unused take shows @entity51 carrying out repairs on an @entity84 difference of scale : the 1980s @entity20 was around the size of a vinyl lp record , and dwarfs the modern dvd only 24 @entity32 systems were built			0
the invention of less cumbersome and less glitch - prone technology saw them phased out - which is why the discovery of the @entity96 is so exciting for film fans			0
the lp - record - sized @entity20 were popular among video enthusiasts because they provided a better - quality product than its contemporary rivals @entity100			0
copy on the @entity60 page , saying that the footage was never officially released , reads : ' now here 's the amazing part for you @entity6 freaks out there ... approximately 30 minutes of unedited raw , unsweetened work - print takes in letterbox format of scene 50 ( @entity34 on @entity26 with @entity10 ) from @entity13 were used ... @entity115 , people yelling action , multiple takes of the same scenes of @entity34 and @entity10			1
' eventually the full 30 minutes will be released in snippets - and no - doubt other @entity6 aficionados the world over will be scanning their sections of the solar system in search of more @entity20 laden with other outtakes .			0

two clips show @entity34 , @entity10 and @entity51 on @entity26
takes were put on forerunner to @entity89 for editing purposes
more clips of further scenes promised
