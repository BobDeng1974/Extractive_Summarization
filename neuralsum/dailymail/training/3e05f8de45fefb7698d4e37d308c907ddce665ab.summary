by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 06:50 est , 12 june 2012 in four billion years , the @entity1 will come hurtling into the @entity3 - tearing planets and suns into new orbits in a fearsome and turbulent battle			1
but @entity1 - flying towards us at more than 250,000 miles an hour - is already a bit of a galactic warrior , having already bumped up against the @entity10 ( otherwise known as @entity10 )			1
recent studies with the @entity13 's @entity12 ( @entity12 ) seem to confirm a disputed 2004 discovery of hydrogen gas streaming between @entity1 and the @entity16			2
fast : @entity1 ( pictured ) is plowing toward @entity19 's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour , which is the equivalent of traveling from @entity19 to the moon in 60 minutes bruised victim : the @entity10 ( pictured ) , which is 2.3 million light years away , had a near miss with @entity1 @entity24 , of the @entity25 , said : ' the properties of this gas indicate that these two galaxies may have passed close together in the distant past			1
' studying what may be a gaseous link between the two can give us a new key to understanding the evolution of both galaxies			0
' the two galaxies , about 2.6 and 3 million light - years , respectively , from @entity19 , are members of the @entity39 of galaxies that includes our own @entity3 and about 30 others			2
the hydrogen ' bridge ' between the galaxies was discovered in 2004 by astronomers using the @entity46 in the @entity47 , but other scientists questioned the discovery on technical grounds			0
detailed studies with the highly - sensitive @entity12 confirmed the existence of the bridge , and showed six dense clumps of gas in the stream			0
observations of these clumps showed that they share roughly the same relative velocity with respect to @entity19 as the two galaxies , strengthening the argument that they are part of a bridge between the two			0
starting off as a tiny speck in the distance , the galaxy known as @entity1 ( left of the picture ) looks harmless at first previously just a small dot , earthlings of the future would be forgiven for panicking as @entity1 moves closer to our galaxy the formerly tiny galaxy now dominates the foreground of the computer generated image as it swallows up the @entity3 when galaxies pass close to each other , one result is ' tidal tails ' of gas pulled into intergalactic space from the galaxies as lengthy streams			1
' we think it 's very likely that the hydrogen gas we see between @entity1 and @entity10 is the remnant of a tidal tail that originated during a close encounter , probably billions of years ago , ' said @entity93 , of @entity94			2
he added : ' the encounter had to be long ago , because neither galaxy shows evidence of disruption today			0
' @entity24 said : ' the gas we studied is very tenuous and its radio emission is extremely faint - so faint that it is beyond the reach of most radio telescopes			0
' we plan to use the advanced capabilities of the @entity12 to continue this work and learn more about both the gas and , hopefully , the orbital histories of the two galaxies			0
' the aftermath : following the collision of the two galaxies , a countless number of stars will be sent spinning into space as @entity1 and the @entity3 lose their previous forms colossal : this @entity117 illustration shows the @entity3 ( left ) and the @entity1 , which are expected to collide in four billion years from now on to our own deadly encounter with @entity1 : the head - on encounter is expected to happen four billion years from now - catapulting our sun to another area of the galaxy , with stars tossed on to different orbits , astronomers at the @entity128 revealed last month			1
although @entity19 and its solar system wo n't be destroyed , it will be pushed away from the galactic core more than it is now			0
' after nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of @entity1 and our @entity3 , we at last have a clear picture of how events will unfold over the coming billions of years , ' said @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity141 - based institute			2
after the @entity1 finally strikes the @entity3 , it will be another two billion years before the two totally come together and form a single elliptical galaxy			1
impact : @entity19 wo n't be destroyed when @entity1 smashes into the @entity3 ( pictured ) , but stars will likely be tossed into different orbits and it will take an additional two billion years for the two galaxies to totally merge			1

@entity1 has already bumped past the ' @entity10 '
stars will be tossed into different orbit around when galaxy hits @entity3
two billion years later , our two galaxies will ' merge ' into one
