a girl who believed she had a bad hangover was found to have 13 blood clots in her lungs			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains – but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before			2
but when the 25 - year - old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious			1
she rushed to hospital , where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms , blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs , killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly			1
she was treated with medication but , incredibly , a year later was dealt another blow – when medics found another melon - sized blockage in her right lung			1
@entity4 , 25 , was horrified to be told she had 13 blood clots in her lungs as she believed she was suffering was just a bad hangover			1
she is pictured before ( left ) and after her diagnosis ( right ) ms @entity4 began coughing up blood and was having difficulty breathing , so rushed to hospital			1
it was there doctors diagnosed pulmonary embolisms - blood clots that were blocking the arteries in her lungs she was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death			1
she now takes blood - thinning medication to prevent future clots , but the shock of the ordeal has led her to completely changed her lifestyle			1
she has given up drinking and taken up exercise in an effort to lead the healthiest life possible , and wants to encourage other to do the same			0
ms @entity4 , who has set up her own diet business , said : ' i was so scared when i started coughing up blood , i had no idea what was happening to me but i knew it was n't a hangover			1
' i used to love partying with friends but after suffering from 13 blood clots , i knew i needed to change my ways			1
' a terrifying experience like this gives you a brand new outlook and makes you appreciate things so much more , i 'm lucky to be alive			0
' i did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture			0
' a pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery , which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs			1
as in miss @entity4 's case , it can be life threatening , as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs			1
a pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery , which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs			2
this blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening , as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs			1
the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals			0
but the main symptoms include : chest pain – a sharp , stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually coughing – this is usually dry , but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood feeling faint , dizzy or passing out a person should visit their gp as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms			2
if symptoms are particularly severe , dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance			0
source : @entity107 the symptoms , feeling dizzy , chest pain , coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals			0
ms @entity4 first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012 , when she was 22 - years - old			2
she was feeling weak and ill , but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before , so she presumed it was just a bad hangover			0
then she started coughing up blood , struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother @entity120 , 54 , and stepfather @entity121 , 57 , decided to rush her to hospital			2
a scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs , though it was found they had not spread from her legs , where clots normally form			1
despite many tests , nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms			0
the only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill , which she stopped taking straightaway			0
she was put on @entity137 injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring , as well as other drugs to reduce the pain			1
ms @entity4 said : ' i had to inject myself every month and i was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots			1
' i was constantly anxious for a year and i suffered from panic attacks and anxiety			0
' because of this anxiety , when she got a similar pain again in may 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it			2
luckily , she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a ct scan revealed she had a melon - sized blockage in her right lung			1
the blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart , and had blocked the artery , cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died			2
ms @entity4 said : ' it was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart , if i had left it any longer i would have died			2
a year later , ms @entity4 was rushed to hospital again , and doctors found a melon - sized blockage in her lungs			1
she is pictured here with partner @entity172 , who she lives with in @entity5 before her illness ( left and right ) , ms @entity4 was a ' party girl ' and loved to drink			0
she has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle			0
' i did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture ' , she said she will now have to take the warfarin , which stops her blood from clotting , for the rest of her life			2
the shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around			0
some doctors advised she should n't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs ' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced			0
but she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the @entity195 in may to show other sufferers that it is possible			0
she said : ' i 'm so thankful to be alive , i have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called @entity199 + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices			0
' i have never felt better and i hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary @entity204 that they can achieve their fitness goals			0
' ms @entity4 has been with her boyfriend @entity172 , who works for a solar panel company , for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in @entity5 together			0
but ms @entity4 is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children			2
she said : ' i really want children in the future because i am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy			0
ms @entity4 has now set up her own diet business , hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits ' i would have to be in a good condition , hence my healthy lifestyle now			0
' dr @entity221 , director of research at the @entity222 , said : ' a pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery , the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs			1
' some blood clots can be life - threatening , for example a large clot in the main artery			1
' sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late			2
