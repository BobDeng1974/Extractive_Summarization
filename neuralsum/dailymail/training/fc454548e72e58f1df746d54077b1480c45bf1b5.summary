@entity0 is haunted by that momentary slip three matches from the end of last season which pulled the @entity6 turf out from under @entity7 as @entity8 champions - elect			1
given time to reflect plus the priceless gift of hindsight , his most vital loss of footing can now be seen as his stumbling failure nine years earlier to drive through a transfer to @entity7 ’s opponents on that fateful april afternoon			1
@entity16 , who capitalised on that rare @entity0 error to both defeat @entity7 and deflate their title challenge , had made a £ 32million bid for him in the summer of 2005			1
@entity0 checks his studs after slipping against @entity16 at @entity6 last season @entity0 lifts the @entity24 in 2005 after the greatest night of his professional career that came just six weeks after he captained @entity7 to the greatest comeback in @entity24 final history , that epic victory over @entity30 from 3 - 0 down in @entity31			1
@entity7 instantly rejected @entity16 ’s offer			1
but @entity0 , although still only 25 , was already suspecting that if he was ever to win a @entity8 title it would have to be with a different team			1
sadly , he has been proved right			0
in fact the drama and emotion of that astonishing night on the banks of the @entity38 had brought him only temporary relief from that sense of foreboding , which had been nagging at him since @entity7 finished 30 points off the pace the preceding season			2
so he asked for a transfer			2
coming from a very local hero , that request was perceived as heresy by the @entity7 faithful and they took to burning replicas of his shirt in the streets			2
as the protests reached a crescendo their @entity0 relented			2
instead of insisting on his right to join the then - reigning @entity8 champions at @entity59 , he signed a new £ 100,000 a week contract			1
the rest , as we always say , is history			0
except that for @entity0 it is not historic			2
since 2005 he and @entity7 have won just one @entity65 and one @entity66 – and still no @entity8 medal for this valiant war - horse for whom the championship of @entity70 has been the @entity72 since he signed for the club round the corner from his house at the age of eight			1
nor is he likely to get one now			0
@entity16 , in that time , have won their first @entity24 , four @entity77 , one @entity66 , the @entity78 once … and that @entity8 title which @entity0 so covets , not once but twice			1
@entity81 lifts the @entity8 trophy in 2010 - it is an honour that has eluded @entity0 right now they lead the championship race by more points than @entity7 can remotely hope to retrieve and @entity0 is in his @entity86 , with the light fading			1
ah , what might have been			0
perhaps a life in @entity70 football would have been impossible for him , given how threatening the passions on @entity92 would have remained had he left the club for which he was born to play			0
but for whatever reason he let his heart over-rule his head , these subsequent nine years have been overflowing from midfield with his commitment to a great club striving to recapture the glory days , and last season so close to doing so			0
this has become a story of uplifting self - sacrifice in this age when footballers change clubs as often as their socks			0
loyalty , however , is oft rewarded by a kick in the head			0
@entity0 ( left ) , @entity111 ( centre ) and @entity113 on the bench at the @entity115 the 34 - year - old was also among the subs against @entity118 on the 16th anniversary of his @entity7 debut @entity0 was left out of what might well have been his last huge night in that hallowed red shirt – last month ’s @entity24 match at @entity124			1
then he was dropped on his 16th anniversary of becoming a @entity7 player at 34 , this one - club servant finds himself embroiled in turmoil as to whether @entity7 want to contract him to end his career with them – or if even he would prefer now to cash in on his last legs with a move to somewhere like the booming @entity135 soccer market			1
again , emotions are coming to the boil on @entity92			0
the @entity7 skipper celebrates scoring his side 's second goal against @entity141 on tuesday players past and present are urging him to stay			2
the fans are petitioning the board to extend his contract			0
and one of the outstanding players of his generation - the dyed - red @entity7 man who told true - blue @entity16 that he could n’t quite bring himself to ‘ jump off the cliff ’ - finds himself back on the precipice			1
this time with the ground crumbling beneath his feet			0
let us hope he makes a happy landing			0
if the @entity8 title is not to be , that is the least @entity0 deserves			1
@entity0 ( third right ) poses with fellow @entity7 greats ( from left ) @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and youngsters @entity170 and @entity172 , with @entity173 and @entity174 at the front @entity176 and @entity177 are @entity178 - long may they last @entity177 posts a smiling selfie and declares himself fit and well to keep up the good fight against @entity181 ’s			1
@entity176 reports himself back in the game after a spell in hospital			2
@entity186 and the @entity185 … long may they last			0
the selfie posted by @entity177 to demonstrate that he is getting better @entity190 - it 's 1 - 0 to the @entity191 to the @entity191 , one - nil			1
what is going on with the team that could n’t hold on to a dog lead this season , until now			0
is it back to the future ? back to the days when one goal was invariably enough for the @entity199 ? perhaps not			0
the answer now seems to be scoring so late – as @entity201 did to beat @entity202 on wednesday night – that they only have to defend their lead for a minute or two			0
@entity201 ( left ) smiles after scoring @entity191 's only goal against @entity202			2

@entity0 asked @entity7 for a transfer in 2005
however , he opted out of a move to @entity16 at the last minute
since then @entity7 have won one @entity65 and one @entity66 , while @entity16 have won the @entity8 twice ( among others )
@entity177 and @entity176 are on the mend
like the old days , it 's a case of 1 - 0 to the @entity191
