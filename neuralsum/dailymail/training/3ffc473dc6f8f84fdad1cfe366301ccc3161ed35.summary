@entity0 : @entity1 , a shadowy oligarch , pictured with a companion , has bought and sold mansions in @entity5 's most prosperous areas at £ 120 million , it is the most expensive town house sold in @entity7			1
now a @entity9 investigation can reveal that @entity11 , in exclusive @entity10 , has been bought by a shadowy @entity13 businessman as part of a £ 250 million shopping spree over three years that has left him with four landmark @entity5 properties			1
@entity1 ’s moves in the @entity5 property market have been obscured by a series of offshore companies , but , along with the palatial @entity25 * listed @entity26 , he also owns 50 st @entity27 , @entity28 , which sold for £ 70million ; a mansion in @entity30 , @entity31 , sold for £ 41million ; and 102 @entity32 in @entity33 , sold for £ 15million			1
@entity1 is regarded as an obscure figure even in the secretive world of oligarchs , and the source of his wealth is unclear			2
he has never appeared in the @entity40 @entity39 and his rise to oligarch status has been as shadowy as it was labyrinthine			1
however , he has grand plans to spend at least £ 1.2million gutting the 33,000 sq ft @entity11 , which was renovated at huge expense by its previous owner , conservative peer @entity46			1
despite being described as ‘ humourless ’ by one associate , @entity1 has been spotted on the @entity48 , rubbing shoulders with the @entity13 elite , and has a reputation as something of a party animal			2
in 2011 , he was reported by a top social affairs columnist in @entity13 to have arranged a party at the @entity57 casino in @entity58 and flew in performers from @entity61 nightclub in @entity62			2
in 2012 , he was at a charity auction hosted by supermodel @entity64 , in aid of her @entity66 , which aims to build playgrounds for underprivileged children			2
at the auction , @entity1 bought a painting of @entity72 herself by @entity75 - based artist @entity74 for £ 460,000			1
he is yet to settle the bill			2
@entity77 , president of the foundation , said : ‘ i can tell you that so far he has paid 50 per cent of this amount , but he did not refuse to pay the rest			2
we are in constant touch with him and we are expecting him to pay in full one day			2
i do not know his reasons for the delay			2
’ this failure to pay in full is all the more remarkable because in that same year @entity1 bought @entity11 and 50 st @entity27			1
the @entity32 property would appear to have been bought in cash , as @entity93 documents show no mortgage lender			1
according to the @entity13 state news agency @entity95 , @entity1 married a woman called @entity97			0
he is named on company records as a @entity13 national			0
@entity97 is understood to be active in @entity5 ’s booming art gallery scene and runs a gallery in @entity102			1
a report in society magazine @entity104 said @entity97 ‘ prefers to be friends with artists rather than to make money ’			1
although she did not reveal the identity of her husband , she said : ‘ as long as i have a source of money away from the arts field , i will use this [ to ] support something eternal			0
’ grandiose plans : @entity11 , the £ 120 million @entity25 * listed mansion in @entity5 's @entity10 palatial : the grand interior of @entity11 features gold walls and chandeliers with floor - to - ceiling windows @entity1 ’s own interest in art first came to the fore in 2006 when he set up various arts and cultural foundations with @entity97 , who also set up an arts - focused company in the @entity127			1
@entity1 ’s identity came to light following a dispute between various estate agents over a ‘ finder ’s fee ’ following his @entity30 purchase			0
the tax tribunal , which confirmed the purchase had gone through , revealed that @entity1 was ‘ very annoyed ’ after being gazumped on another prime @entity5 property			1
when he was told the @entity30 property was available , later that night he drove past and offered to buy it for £ 43million , according to tribunal papers			2
the tribunal heard this was an astonishing offer , ‘ considerably in excess of the value of the property ’			0
with two swimming pools , the double - fronted house boasts seven bedrooms and has been refurbished to the tune of around £ 10million			2
bought by @entity1 in 2011 for £ 41million , it has recently been put back on the market for £ 46.5million			1
in 2012 , he bought a £ 460,000 painting of @entity13 model @entity64 but has yet to settle the bill equally extraordinary are his grandiose plans for @entity11			1
@entity46 bought a 150 - year lease on the property , built in 1827 , from the @entity158 for £ 5.9million in 1994 and hired @entity159 , the favourite architect of the @entity160 , to transform it into a palatial home			1
@entity1 wants to substantially expand the property , increasing the size of its underground swimming pool , as well as adding a spa , with steam room , sauna , water jets , massage room , gym and yoga room , and a private cinema			0
@entity1 also has expensive plans for 50 st @entity27			1
the building was originally run by fishmonger ’s son @entity177 , whose head for figures was matched only by his capacity to fleece the aristocracy			0
he ran it as the @entity185 ’s club and gambling den for 40 years – it is even rumoured to have an escape tunnel			0
the grand house then became the louche @entity189 for 108 years , until it closed in 1976			0
it subsequently operated as a casino , before closing in 2009			0
until recently , there were plans for 50 st @entity27 to revert to its origins as a gentlemen ’s members ’ club , replete with a spa , 14 - bedroom hotel , and two restaurants			2
@entity1 ’s origins remain cloaked in mystery but he is understood until recently to have been a senior executive of @entity205 , an offshoot of the controversial @entity13 oil and gas giant @entity207			0
lawyers for @entity1 said he stepped down in 2013			0
respected @entity102 business newspaper @entity210 said that @entity1 , along with his father @entity211 , owned 83 per cent of a firm called @entity213			0
@entity214 was involved in the building of a huge £ 1.5billion trading and exhibition centre , @entity218 , on the outskirts of @entity102 , which sold last year for an undisclosed sum , according to the newspaper			1
a source told @entity9 that the deal is likely to have taken the @entity224 into the financial big league			0
lawyers for mr @entity1 said he had made his money through property development , road haulage and forestry , and had made ‘ significant profit ’ in the 1990s			0
he was at @entity231 between 2002 and 2013			0
a spokesman for @entity205 said : ‘ according to the current legislation , a @entity232 is not obliged to submit a declaration of his income and property because he is not a state official			0
we do not possess any information if a @entity232 owns any property in @entity7			0
’ however , documents obtained by @entity9 confirm @entity1 ’s interests			0
@entity244 ( @entity245 ) is listed as the owner of 102 @entity32 on the @entity93			0
previous purchases : built in 1827 and run as a gambling den for the aristocracy with an escape tunnel , there are plans for 50 @entity27 , which sold for £ 70 million , to once again become a gentlemen 's club leafy : now back on sale at £ 46.5 million , this double - fronted house in @entity30 , @entity31 , with two pools and seven bedrooms , has had a £ 10 million refurbishment after @entity1 snapped it up classical : built around 1825 by the @entity264 family and set in @entity5 's @entity33 , this @entity25 * building is in a classical square where @entity266 also owns property and where @entity268 lived @entity244 , which is based in @entity245 , shows @entity1 as shareholder			1

@entity276 , a top broker who worked on the @entity11 deal , also confirmed @entity1 bought the house from @entity46			1
following repeated requests from @entity9 in both the @entity127 and @entity13 , lawyers for @entity1 insisted that his property ownership was a private matter and said he was not the registered proprietor of @entity11 , 102 @entity32 , 50 @entity284 and @entity30			1
they declined to comment on his failure to pay the balance of the charity painting			0
when asked about @entity1 ’s property plans , @entity5 - based businesswoman @entity288 , believed to be involved in the purchase of @entity32 , said : ‘ i do n’t think he is interested in discussing it with the press			1
