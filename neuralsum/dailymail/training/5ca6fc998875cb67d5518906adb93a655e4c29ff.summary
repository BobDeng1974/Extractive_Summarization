@entity0 sits alone behind a desk in a bar in the @entity3 , a 9,500 - seat outpost in north - west @entity4			1
there is no @entity7 translator , no opposition manager , his stage is makeshift and some of the local journalists are supping @entity12 beer			2
it is about as far removed as imaginable from the fanfare which would accompany a press conference at a venue such as @entity19 ’s @entity18 home			1
‘ that ( @entity18 ) is the ultimate , ’ said the @entity24 boss ahead of thursday 's @entity29 first - leg play - off against @entity25			1
‘ it ’s for the players , the club and the supporters more than anything , to go and have a night out at @entity18			0
‘ no disrespect to @entity25 , where we are now , but that ’s the aim and that ’s where we want to be in the next round if we can			1
‘ i ’ve never played at @entity18 , but i have been there			0
’ @entity45 will make his debut but fellow summer signing @entity22 is set to miss the majority of the season after dislocating his kneecap			1
@entity20 dealt cruel @entity52 blow ready for action : @entity24 prepare for thursday 's @entity29 first - leg play - off in @entity4 the @entity55 , a £ 7million arrival from @entity57 , will be out for around six months and @entity0 , who sold @entity59 to @entity60 for £ 12m last week , is very much in the market for reinforcements			1
‘ we ’re working tirelessly , ’ he said			0
‘ if i had this press conference a week ago i would not think i would be sat here without @entity59 and @entity22			2
‘ we ’ll have to try to bring a replacement in			0
’ this is @entity0 ’s first foray into continental competition as a manager			2
he was , though , just 10 minutes away from an embarrassing exit against @entity72 minnows as @entity73 earlier this month			0
‘ it would have been devastating to go out , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re under no illusion about how difficult it is going to be for us and it would be wrong for me to damn the competition when we have never been in it for 100 years			0
the easy thing would be to say , “ we do n’t want to take part ” — but what sort of message would that be ? upbeat : @entity0 wants to enjoy his first taste of @entity85 competition as a manager ‘ it ’s a fantastic competition and we ’re going to try to enjoy it			2
‘ the people of @entity24 , we saw last time with a full house , are delighted to see us play in @entity7			1
we ’ve got to try to do as best we can and see if we can get into the group stage			0
’ @entity24 face @entity92 at the @entity93 on sunday , and @entity0 went on : ‘ the biggest challenge for all of us is handling the demands of playing another game back in the @entity97 at the weekend – far bigger clubs with better resources than us have struggled			1
‘ the easy thing would be to say “ we do n’t want to take part ” – but what sort of message would that be ? ‘ it ’s a fantastic competition and we ’re going to try to enjoy it			0
’ @entity0 would certainly enjoy the @entity18 .			2

possibility of mouth - watering tie against @entity19 on offer for @entity24
