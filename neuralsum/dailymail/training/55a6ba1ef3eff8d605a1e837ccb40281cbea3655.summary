no sooner had @entity0 led by example scoring a sumptuous early nerve - settler against @entity3 than he was being branded a pariah for needlessly kicking out at @entity5 and getting sent off			1
yet that was already his third goal alongside two assists in the opening six games of this campaign and put him ahead of @entity12 – and behind @entity16 and @entity17 – as the third all - time @entity14 top - scorer on 176 goals			0
@entity18 now desperately need @entity19 and @entity20 to pick up some of the considerable slack that will be left behind in @entity0 's absence			1
@entity20 and @entity19 are set to become @entity18 's first - choice strike partnership with @entity0 suspended for the next three matches following his red card against @entity3 on saturday @entity26 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity20 after the @entity28 set up his goal at @entity30 @entity20 has not yet found the net for @entity18 but it certainly is n't for the want of trying @entity19 scores to put @entity18 two goals to the good against @entity3 at @entity34 on saturday @entity0 will be suspended for three matches after his straight red card against @entity3 the @entity18 captain kicked out at @entity5 as the @entity3 winger raced clear ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 ; @entity20 , @entity19 especially as they face tricky matches hosting @entity50 and @entity51 at @entity34 and travelling away to @entity52 without their talisman			1
@entity20 is yet to score in a @entity18 shirt since his £ 6million loan move from @entity56 and @entity57 needs him to start hitting the back of the net			2
there is a reason the 28 - year - old 's total transfer fees is already £ 90.2m , which will go well over the £ 100m mark when @entity18 make the move permanent for £ 45m next summer – in league matches alone he has netted 138 times in 207 starts			2
that is a stunning rate of a goal every one - and - a - half starts			0
@entity26 is beginning to shake off his early - season fatigue from competing in the @entity74 with @entity75 , scoring twice in the past two games			2
@entity0 had earlier showed his deadly instinct to give @entity18 the lead @entity20 came with great expectations and now @entity18 really need him to start performing @entity26 celebrates with @entity20 after doubling @entity18 's lead against @entity3 on saturday october 5 - @entity50 ( @entity81 ) october 20 - @entity82 ( a ) october 26 - @entity51 ( @entity81 ) his first game back will likely be the @entity86 derby at the @entity87 on november 2			1
but his scoring rate for this campaign is still just one goal every 203 minutes , something he needs to vastly improve on without @entity0 around			2
@entity0 's ban also provides the chance for @entity47 to get a foot - hold in the team , as the natural replacement in behind the two strikers			1
the @entity99 is becoming the perennially pushed aside – sidelined by @entity101 at @entity51 and now , seemingly , @entity57 at @entity18 – but will surely have his chance to make his mark			0
with former club @entity105 reportedly waiting in the wings to make a bid in the january transfer window , this could be his last real opportunity to impress			0
there are goals and assists in @entity18 's wealth of midfield and attacking options ; @entity26 , @entity20 , @entity47 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity44 , @entity117			1
but where will the fierce bite come from which is at the heart of @entity0 's game ? source : @entity123 @entity47 ( bottom left ) is likely to be the one to benefit most from @entity0 's suspension @entity18 have already lacked backbone this season , crumbling at @entity30 , being brushed aside by @entity130 @entity129 and held at newly - promoted @entity131			1
there is no obvious replacement for the screaming , furious passion which resonates from the @entity137 forward to the rest of the team			0
his international team - mate @entity140 , who he replaced as captain of the national side , described @entity0 as a ' natural leader			2
' he revealed of their time with @entity137 : ' before a game , he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room			0
he would n’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one - to - one , telling them what is expected			0
' video we fought to the end - @entity57 @entity0 's absence presents a dilemma for @entity57 and his assistant @entity158 @entity0 's passion was very much in evidence during @entity18 's 5 - 3 defeat to @entity30 @entity18 are seventh in the @entity14 table , eight points behind the leaders @entity51 where will that be found in a new team built from £ 150m spending this summer with a few teenagers being brought into the first - team fold ? who will call out those not working hard enough in the dressing room at half - time if they 're struggling in the next few weeks ? @entity0 has apologised for his red card , but it is @entity18 who could be sorry to see him on the sidelines instead of at the centre of their team in the next month			1
they are already eight points off @entity51 at the top of the table – that gap could be far greater by the time he is back			0

@entity0 will be suspended for three games following red card against @entity3 at the weekend
@entity19 and @entity20 must perform to *compensate* for the captain 's absence
@entity0 has been sharp this season and suits his new leadership role
@entity20 has yet to open his account but @entity26 is in form
@entity0 will miss matches against @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity51
he is likely to return for the @entity86 derby on november 2
@entity47 is likely to be restored to the side in his absence
