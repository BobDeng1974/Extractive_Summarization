it was a mainstay of family motoring for the @entity3 ’s striving middle classes in the sixties and seventies			2
now , 50 years after the launch of the original , @entity3 ’s much - loved @entity6 is to be revived			1
the economical new @entity6 will cost under £ 7,000 and will manage up to 70mpg			1
after 50 years since it was first introduced , the @entity6 is making a comeback and will be available from next spring costing £ 6,000 and available with bluetooth and @entity12 connections , it is a far - cry from its 70s namesake details of the @entity6 revival as a sharply styled small hatchback are revealed in the latest edition of motoring magazine @entity18			1
the original @entity6 was launched in june 1964 with the first ‘ ha ’ model with a 1.0 litre engine coming off the @entity6 production line at @entity22 in @entity23			1
many teenagers of the era learned to drive in the popular cars , which were a middle - class family favourite			2
such is its understated but enduring charm , the car has even been mentioned in an @entity33 song			2
the last time the @entity6 name was seen was in 1979 on a small family saloon car – a forerunner to today ’s @entity37 - after a 15 year run during which 1.5million @entity39 were sold			1
the slightly larger , re-styled and re-worked second generation ‘ @entity41 ’ @entity6 was unveiled in 1966 for a four - year run before being overtaken by the ‘ @entity43 ’ which ran until the @entity6 ’s demise in 1979 , to be replaced by the @entity37			1
the ' @entity45 was built at @entity6 's @entity22 factory in @entity23 from 1970 to 1979 costing from £ 783 after a 35 year gap bosses at the @entity3 car - maker have decided the time is right for a return in its @entity3 heartland			1
in 2004 the @entity6 name was briefly used on a car created @entity6 ’s parent company @entity53 for @entity54			2
but this will be the first time since 1979 that it will be used in its home market of @entity3			1
the new @entity6 is set to go on sale next @entity59 after being unveiled officially at the @entity60 in march			0
it will cost £ 6,995 designed to take on small rivals such as the @entity62 , @entity63 , plus the @entity64 up ! , @entity65 and @entity65			1
the new city hatchback will only be called ‘ @entity6 ’ in the @entity3 – marking the first time in more than 20 years that @entity6 and @entity70 , its @entity69 - based @entity53 sibling , will use different names for a car in the @entity3 and mainland @entity73			0
@entity18 editor - in - chief @entity74 said : ‘ it ’s great that a cherished @entity3 name is being revived			0
' many people will remember being driven as children in a @entity6 on family outings , or even learning to drive in one			0
@entity6 became a middle - class favourite and will be remembered by many as they car they learned to drive in the optional extras on the 1970s model included three or four doors and did just 30 to 37 mpg ' @entity39 were a solid , unflashy but popular and practical family car which many remember fondly			1
’ sadly , the new generation five - door @entity6 city car will not be built like the original at @entity22 , but in @entity91			1
it will share the underpinnings of the next generation @entity94			0
but insiders say @entity53 ’s @entity73 design team , led by @entity98 @entity97 , has worked hard to give the car its own unique look			0
there ’ll be five doors and easy access , while dynamically the new model is said by @entity6 insiders to focus more on comfort and refinement than sporty handling			2
@entity18 ’s mr @entity74 said : ’ expect some typical @entity6 design cues			0
there ’ ll be swept - back headlamps with distinctive led daytime running lights , a large @entity6 badge sitting on large chrome wings on the grille			2
’ ‘ @entity116 will be key to the new @entity6 ’s appeal			0
to keep the costs down there wo n’t be the huge array of options seen on other small cars			0
' but inside different finishes have been used on the plastics to give a more stylish , premium look			0
’ there will be some modern must - have technology on board – such as @entity131 and - @entity130 connectivity - but potential buyers are warned not to expect the cutting - edge infotainment systems which would simply make the car too costly			0
to keep running costs and emissions low , the new car is expected to be powered by @entity6 ’s latest family of small , economical engines such as the new three - cylinder , 1.0 - litre engine			0
@entity6 is aiming to keep emissions – on which road tax is based - to under 100g/km which would mean an average fuel economy of around 70mpg			0
an all - new , @entity3 - built @entity37 set to be unveiled at next year ’s @entity145 .			1
