@entity0 is in line to meet @entity2 in the legendary @entity4 ’s landmark first fight at the age of 50			1
the hold up in plans for the @entity7 to face @entity8 in @entity9 has raised the lucrative alternative of a summer world title fight between @entity0 and @entity2			1
@entity0 , already frustrated by legal issues repeatedly delaying the finalising of contracts with @entity15 , has sustained a minor elbow injury which would have affected his preparations for the scheduled date of march 28			2
@entity0 is in line to take on 50 - year - old @entity4 legend @entity2 this year @entity0 wants to fulfil one of his dreams by fighting either at the @entity22 or in @entity9 that comes just as @entity2 has confirmed his intention of ‘ at least one more fight ’ following his 50th birthday last thursday			1
the recently dethroned world light - heavyweight champion has also advised @entity29 , in whom he is a shareholder , that he is ‘ ready to come down to super-middleweight ’ for what he calls ‘ a massive , hugely exciting fight with @entity0			2
’ the options under @entity0 ’s consideration are @entity37 ’s @entity22 in june or the @entity38 in @entity9 in middle to late april			1
either would fulfil one of @entity0 ’s long - standing ambitions – boxing before a huge crowd in his beloved @entity37 ’s @entity22 or bringing his career to a climax in the fight capital of the world			1
the choice would probably rest upon whether it would go on late enough at night in @entity49 – like 3 or 4am – to meet the schedule of the pay - per - view tv networks in @entity4			2
@entity2 has passed 50 but is showing no signs of slowing down and wants ' at least one more fight ' @entity0 is coming off the back of two wins over @entity57 rival @entity56 the vegas dream was the motivation for seeking the fight with @entity15			1
however , negotiations with the same - name son of the iconic @entity64 fighter have been deeply complicated by his contractual dispute with @entity66 , his @entity68 promoter			0
@entity66 is highly likely to take legal action in defence of his conviction that @entity15 owes him one more fight			0
he told me : ‘ if @entity8 wants to fight @entity0 he will have to bite the bullet of @entity76 ( @entity66 ’s company ) being the promoter			2
’ it is by no means certain that even @entity78 , the secretive @entity79 now representing so many fighters in @entity4 including @entity15 , can guarantee the @entity0 fight actually happening			2
@entity2 was dominated by @entity81 in their world title fight in @entity84 in november @entity2 with @entity4 heavyweight @entity85 before his win over @entity87 @entity0 is not closing the @entity15 door completely but is now very alert to the chance of joining @entity2 in a history - making event			1
it was confirmed on tuesday , too , that @entity15 will take on light heavyweight former world title challenger @entity92 on april 18			1
he says : ‘ the elbow would have affected my training for @entity15			0
i am also aware of the situation regarding @entity2 and i am very interested in that fight			0
’ to say that @entity2 is interested would be a substantial understatement			0
he told me recently : ‘ this would be a great fight wherever it happens			0
if it ’s in @entity57 i ’d happily take a boat to get over there			0
’ one possible venue for a fight between @entity0 and @entity2 is @entity37 's @entity22 @entity0 has grown frustrated of negotiations with @entity8 over a fight in @entity9 @entity8 has a dispute with @entity66 now , despite losing his belt to @entity81 over 12 hard rounds in december , this astonishingly fit veteran is telling various sources in the @entity4 : ‘ i will fight at 50 so that people can fully understand why i call myself ' @entity117 '			1
nor do i want a ‘ soft ’ win over a nobody			0
it needs to be a significant championship fight			0
’ @entity2 has been sounding out @entity81 ’s rival light - heavy champion @entity119 and middleweight knock - out sensation @entity120			0
but @entity119 is thought to be reluctant to follow in @entity81 ’s footsteps			0
and the wide disparity in poundage between @entity2 and @entity120 is a significant obstacle and there would be no title on the line if they met at a catch - weight			2
@entity0 at super-middleweight would give @entity2 a shot at two world title belts			1
the @entity133 have ordered @entity0 to open negotiations for a mandatory defence against fellow @entity57 @entity136 by the end of this month			1
however , that elbow injury also opens the door for @entity0 to seek a stay of execution			0
questions were already being asked as to why another mandatory defence is being demanded of @entity0 immediately following two such fights with @entity56			2
@entity145 also that @entity2 , too , has been a distinguished champion for their organisation , the @entity133 are now inviting @entity0 to request an exemption			2
their @entity149 chairman @entity148 says : ‘ if @entity0 makes such an application we will give it full consideration in the next 15 days			0
’ @entity0 has been ordered by the @entity133 to begin negotiations with mandatory challenger @entity136 even if such a plea was rejected @entity0 would still bring to the table his ‘ regular ’ @entity158 world title			1
not that any governing body would want to miss out on a fight for which global fascination would be further excited by the possibility of it providing the grand finale of not one but two phenomenal careers			0
be it in @entity37 ’s penalty area or along that desert strip , a crock of gold is awaiting these two gentlemen of the prize - ring			0
the powers of recovery which have helped keep @entity175 undefeated through more than 30 professional fights on his climb to world champion status have been revealed as even more special by the announcement that he will return to the ring on march 28			1
@entity175 needed 34 staples in a deep , vicious leg - wound after being stabbed on holiday following his winning of the @entity133 world welterweight belt from @entity4 ’s @entity188			1
@entity175 will return to the ring on march 28 after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in @entity191 @entity175 won the @entity133 world welterweight title when he beat @entity188 in @entity193 in august there were fears that the injury might be career - threatening , but brook will be ready in just nine weeks to defend that title in his home town of @entity200 - @entity199 indeed			1
his challenger will be named this thursday and is expected to one of two @entity204 - based boxers , no 1 contender @entity202 or the more lowly ranked @entity205			0
@entity175 ’s first world title defence will be televised live on @entity207 on march 28 .			1

@entity0 is in line to meet @entity4 legend @entity2
@entity2 turned 50 this year but shows no signs of slowing down
fight would take place either at @entity22 in @entity49 or in @entity9
@entity133 have ordered @entity0 to open negotiations for a mandatory world title defence against fellow @entity57 @entity136
@entity220 will take on light heavyweight former world title challenger @entity92 on april 18
@entity175 to return to the ring on march 28 in @entity200
