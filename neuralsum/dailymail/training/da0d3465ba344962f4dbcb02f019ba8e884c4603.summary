by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 18:53 est , 15 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:14 est , 16 december 2013 labour leader @entity4 was today accused of wanting to ' forcibly rip - up ' the countryside under controversial plans to allow towns and cities to spread			1
he used a major speech on housing to vow to take on ‘ stick - in - the - mud ’ rural and suburban councils that are refusing to build new homes			0
he condemned the government ’s hugely controversial reforms of the planning system to encourage development as ‘ tinkering ’			1
labour leader @entity4 , who today visited @entity21 housing development in @entity22 , argued that cities and towns should be able to expand places such as @entity22 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 would be handed a new ‘ right to grow ’ , meaning the objections of surrounding authorities who block the construction of new homes would be overridden			1
but the @entity34 hit back at the idea of allowing metropolitan councils - which are often @entity37 - run - to force through house building in rural areas which are more often @entity40 - controlled			2
communities secretary @entity41 said : ' @entity37 ’s policy shows this is the same old @entity43			2
' they would allow @entity37 councils to forcibly rip up @entity47 protection in neighbouring councils			0
while their new tax on planning permission would reduce housebuilding and discourage regeneration schemes			0
we know there is more to do to help build homes			0
' but this must be done by working with hardworking families in communities across @entity60 , allowing councils to shape where development should and should n’t go via @entity63 , and safeguarding important environmental protections			0
’ it marks an escalation in the increasingly heated debate over planning , and pitches mr @entity4 into an angry confrontation with shire councils and countryside campaigners			1
the @entity37 leader condemned ‘ home - blocking councils ’ on the borders of towns and cities and also attack ‘ land - hoarding developers ’ who sit on plots even after they are granted planning permission			2
the @entity83 ’s attempts to speed up and encourage development has been condemned by organisations such as the @entity86			0
but mr @entity4 , speaking in @entity22 , where proposed development beyond its borders has been stalled for years , insisted that the shortage of new homes is a serious threat to @entity60 ’s future prosperity			2
row : tories accused mr @entity4 of wanting to rip - up the countryside y forcing developments in the @entity47 @entity37 is to set up an independent commission on housing , to be headed by former council chief executive and @entity100 chairman sir @entity99			1
it will draw up detailed plans on how to increase the construction of new homes in @entity104 to more than 200,000 a year by the end of the next parliament if @entity37 wins power			1
row : tories accused mr @entity4 of wanting to rip - up the countryside y forcing developments in the @entity47 mr @entity4 said : ‘ i want to send a clear message today : we will tackle those councils that block homes , those developers that hoard land and this government that fails to act on the worst housing shortages for a generation			1
‘ we will stand up for home builders and first - time buyers and take on those who stand in the way of working people and their children having the decent homes they deserve			0
’ mr @entity4 said that @entity37 would side with local authorities such as @entity22 that want to build new homes – and condemn those such as neighbouring @entity129 that systematically block such development			1
he announced that four @entity37 - controlled councils – @entity22 , @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity27 – have signed up to become the first ‘ right to grow ’ local authorities where there is immediate potential to build 40,000 new homes			1
mr @entity4 praised @entity22 as ‘ an example of how successful new towns can be ’ and attack neighbouring @entity140 as a ‘ stick - in - the - mud ’ council that was home - blocking			0
the @entity37 leader added : ‘ of course it is right that local communities have a say about where housing goes			0
‘ but councils can not be allowed to frustrate continually the efforts of others councils to get homes built			0
’ he also commited @entity37 to giving communities controversial new ‘ use it or lose it ’ powers to release land that is being hoarded by developers even though it has planning permission .			2

@entity4 will condemn @entity161 *'s* planning reforms as ' tinkering '
places like @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 should be given ' right to grow '
@entity37 would override objections of surrounding authorities who block construction of new homes
