by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 7 june 2013 a former drone operator who helped kill 1,626 targets says he 's haunted by the carnage he witnessed from behind his computer screen			1
@entity6 , 27 , served as a drone operator from 2006 to 2011 at bases in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
it was a desk job of sorts , but unlike any other , it involved ordering unmanned aircraft to kill faraway targets while he watched			1
in an interview with @entity19 ' foreign correspondent @entity18 , @entity6 recalled one operation where his team fired two missiles from a drone at three men in @entity25			1
he ca n't forget seeing the carnage of the victims ' the guy that was running forward , he ’s missing his right leg , ' he said , recalling what he saw of the scene through the thermal images on his screen			1
' and i watch this guy bleed out and , i mean , the blood is hot			0
' he recalled watching the mens ' bodies grow cold , as slowly the red color detecting the heat of their bodies grew smaller			0
' i can see every little pixel if i just close my eyes , ' he said			0
@entity6 is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his five years as a drone operator			1
he said he sought help for the emotions he was experiencing on his job but ' one of the weird things about the whole drone community is you do n't talk about anything that you 've done			1
you just do n't , ' he told @entity62			1
@entity6 recalled to @entity19 when an @entity64 recruiter told him that as a drone operator , ' he would be like the smart guys in the control room in a @entity69 movie			1
' but that was n't the case			0
he said he began feeling paranoid that he was killing innocent people , not @entity75 insurgents			0
and he felt that it was n't his place to question the people giving him orders to launch the missile attacks			0
deadly machines : two @entity83 unmanned aerial vehicles are seen on the tarmac at a @entity83 test facility in @entity86 , @entity87 according to reports by @entity19 and @entity91 newspapers , @entity6 's paranoia may not be unfounded			1
@entity19 reported thursday that the @entity92 does not know the identity of a quarter of those killed in drone strikes in @entity96			1
@entity91 's @entity97 has also reported that at least 265 of up to 482 people who were killed by drones during a 12 - month period ending september 2011 were not senior @entity101 leaders but instead were ' assessed ' as unknown extremists			2
the reports add to growing scrutiny of president @entity106 's increased reliance on unmanned aircraft			0
the @entity64 now has roughly 1,300 drone operators , which is four times what it had in 2008			2
as the drone program grows , researchers are beginning to delve into the psychological effects of remotely - controlled warfare			2
a recent study by @entity117 researchers found that the prevalence of depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among drone operators is equal to that of deployed pilots			2
' remotely piloted aircraft pilots may stare at the same piece of ground for days , ' @entity125 , co-author of the study , told the @entity129			2
' they witness the carnage			0
manned aircraft pilots do n’t do that			0
they get out of there as soon as possible			0
' president @entity106 's increasing reliance on unmanned aircraft has come under fire on @entity137 based on his commander 's count , @entity6 helped kill 1,626 people during his time as a drone operator			1
he is now retired from the @entity64 and has returned to his home in @entity144 , where he is haunted by that number and the images of carnage that he saw			2
' i do n’t feel like i can really interact with that average , everyday person , ' he told @entity19			0
' i get too frustrated , because @entity151 , they do n't realize what 's going on over there			0
and @entity155 , they do n't care			0
