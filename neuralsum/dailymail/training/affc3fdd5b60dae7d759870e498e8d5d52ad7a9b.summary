the @entity0 is warming fastest at two of its corners in the @entity4 and the @entity5 , a new temperature record analysis has revealed			1
northeastern states - led by @entity8 and @entity9 - have gotten the hottest in the last 30 years in annual temperature , gaining 2.5 degrees on average			1
but @entity14 states have heated up the most in the hottest months : the average @entity16 summer is 3.4 degrees warmer now than in 1984 ; in @entity18 , the dog days are 2.8 degrees hotter			1
tourists walk close to misters to keep cool as they walk along @entity21 during a heat wave in @entity23			0
an @entity25 analysis of federal temperature records shows @entity28 's capital city , @entity29 , has warmed the most in the last 30 years than any other city in the nation			1
to determine what parts of the country have warmed the most , the @entity25 analyzed @entity36 temperature trends in the lower 48 states , 192 cities and 344 smaller regions within the states			1
climate scientists suggested 1984 as a starting date because 30 years is a commonly used time period and 1984 , which had an average temperature , is not a cherry - picked year to skew a trend either way			1
the trend was calculated by the @entity36 using the least squares regression method , which is a standard statistical tool			0
the contiguous @entity0 ' annual average temperature has warmed by 1.2 degrees since 1984 , with summers getting 1.6 degrees hotter			1
but that does n't really tell you how hot it 's gotten for most @entity0			0
while man - made greenhouse gases warm the world as a whole , weather is supremely local			0
some areas have gotten hotter than others because of atmospheric factors and randomness , climate scientists say			0
' in the @entity0 , it is n't warming equally , ' said @entity64 , climatologist at the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity28			2
' be careful about extrapolating from your own backyard to the globe			0
' for example , while people in the @entity73 and @entity74 were complaining about a cold winter this year , @entity70 's @entity28 and neighboring @entity71 were having some of their warmest winter months ever			2
to determine what parts of the country have warmed the most , the @entity25 analyzed @entity36 temperature trends in the lower 48 states , 192 cities and 344 smaller regions within the states			2
climate scientists suggested 1984 as a starting date because 30 years is a commonly used time period and 1984 , which had an average temperature , is not a cherry - picked year to skew a trend either way			1
ten - year - old @entity90 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , stops to cool off in a misting fan while walking along @entity21 with his family in @entity23 , one of @entity0 's warmest cities			2
the trend was calculated by the @entity36 using the least squares regression method , which is a standard statistical tool			0
all but one of the lower 48 states have warmed since 1984			0
@entity101 is the lone outlier , and cooled slightly			0
ten states - @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity16 , @entity109 and @entity110 - have gotten at least 2 degrees warmer in the past 30 years			1
since 1984 , 92 percent of the more than 500 cities and smaller regions within states have warmed and nearly two - thirds of them have warmed by at least a degree			2
the analysis of federal temperature records shows @entity29 has warmed the most than any other city in the nation in the last 30 years			1
the average temperature in @entity29 has risen 4.1 degrees since 1984			1
@entity122 , @entity123 , came in second , posting a rise of 4 degrees			1
@entity23 , known for its sweltering summers , was sixth , with an increase of 3.4 degrees			0
but it 's the boost in summertime heat that really makes @entity29 stand out			2
the average temperature for june , july and august has soared 6.8 degrees over the last three decades , 2.2 degrees higher than second - place @entity122 and 2.4 degrees above third - place @entity23			1
the summertime average is up from about 68 degrees to nearly 75			2
the regions that have warmed the most have been @entity110 's @entity134 , northeastern @entity9 , northern @entity8 , the northeastern plains of @entity16 and western @entity9 , all of which have warmed by more than 2.5 degrees			1
cities - where data is a tad more suspect because they are based on a single weather station and readings can be affected by urban heating and development - see the greatest variation			2
@entity29 , @entity28 , and @entity122 , @entity123 , are the cities that have seen the most warming - both year - round and in summer - since 1984			1
both cities ' average annual temperatures have jumped more than 4 degrees in just 30 years , while @entity151 , @entity101 , has dropped the most , a bit more than 2 degrees			1
cities - where data is a tad more suspect because they are based on a single weather station and readings can be affected by urban heating and development - see the greatest variation			0
the @entity5 warming , especially in the summer , seems to be driven by dryness , because when there is little water the air and ground warm up faster , said @entity165 , a climate scientist at @entity167 in @entity168			0
' @entity169 and drought are a vicious cycle that has been hitting the @entity5 hard in recent years , ' @entity165 said			0
and in the @entity4 , the temperatures are pushed up by milder winters and warm water in the @entity175 , said @entity176 , climate analysis chief at the @entity178			0
and less snow on the ground over the winter often means warmer temperatures , said @entity182 , a climate scientist at @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity9			0
the @entity186 and @entity187 were among the places that warmed the least			0
in the @entity186 and @entity190 , industrial sulfur particle pollutants from coal burning may be reflecting sunlight , thus countering heating caused by coal 's carbon dioxide emissions , said @entity197 professor @entity196 .			0

northeastern states led by @entity8 and @entity9 - have gotten the hottest in the last 30 years in annual temperature , gaining 2.5 degrees on average
@entity14 states *including* @entity16 and @entity18 also hit
@entity29 , @entity28 , and @entity122 , @entity123 , are the cities that have seen the most warming
