how many planets can you fit between @entity2 and the moon ? if your answer was anything less than ‘ all of them ’ then we ’re afraid you 're incorrect			1
in an amazing mosaic image it ’s shown how you can fit all other worlds in the solar system between us and our natural satellite , with room to spare			1
of course , such a scenario will never actually happen - but it ’s surprising to see just how much space there is from here to the moon			0
this image posted to @entity22 shows that all the planets of the solar system could fit between us and the moon			1
there would even be room to spare to fit a dwarf planet like @entity28			1
the amazing image highlights just how far the moon is from @entity2 - at an average distance of 238,555 miles ( 384,400km ) the graphic was posted to @entity22 by user @entity32			1
in the image it ’s shown how @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 would all fit in the gap			2
the result is a fairly snug fit with about 4,990 miles ( 8,030km ) to spare , using the average @entity46 of 238,555 miles ( 384,400km )			0
in reality the distance between @entity2 and the moon varies from 225,622 miles ( 363,104km ) to 252,088 miles ( 405,696km ) - the lower limit of which would not leave room for @entity42			2
however , @entity53 from @entity54 did the maths and found the numbers were a little off , with the actual distance left when using the average @entity46 would be about 2,729 miles ( 4,392km )			0
this , he says , would be enough to also fit @entity28 in the line - up and another dwarf planet except @entity62 , which is too large			1
but , in this hypothetical solar system where all the planets have been lined up as shown in the image , what would become of each world ? ‘ this wonderful line - up would soon degenerate into a single super-planet , ’ professor @entity69 from the @entity70 at the @entity71 told @entity72			1
‘ first , the rocky planets [ @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity2 and @entity38 ] would be cannibalised by @entity39			2
’ ‘ then the gas giants [ @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ] will fall into the murky depths of @entity78 where they create gigantic oscillations , forcing massive shells of material to be ejected			0
‘ as @entity40 then gets swallowed , a massive core would then form , creating a new planet with possibly a quarter of the total mass being ejected			0
‘ the enormous energy released would light up the galaxy , and all within one glorious week			1
‘ but thereafter we would be forgotten except for our feeble attempts to communicate with other civilisations that may or may not exist , and possibly do n't care whether we do			0
’ last year astronomical artist @entity90 created eye - opening illustrations imagining what the night sky would look like if the moon was replaced by the other planets in the solar system			1
here we see how big @entity39 would look in the sky if it were in the position of the moon this incredible image was taken by @entity101 's @entity100 on its way to @entity78 in august 2011			1
it shows how big the gap is between @entity2 ( the white dot on the left ) and the moon ( the dot on the right )			0
here they are 250,000 miles ( 402,000km ) apart			0
it was taken from a distance of six million miles ( 9.7 million km ) dr @entity112 from the @entity113 at the @entity114 told @entity72 that , while the scenario might seem absurd , it is ‘ not 100 per cent crazy			1
’ he says that in other planetary systems some exoplanets may have migrated into the inner regions and , while likely not as extreme as the scenario envisages by @entity121 , they could have formed giant planets known as @entity39			2
‘ so although that never happened in our solar system , something like that has happened [ elsewhere ] , ’ he explains			2
' collisions between planetary embryos will certainly have occurred during the formation of exoplanetary systems - as happened in our own			0
' however , it would not have occurred not in the extreme way shown in the [ mosaic image ]			0
' this artist 's illustration shows what a @entity39 might look like around another star			0
these super planets , dozens of which have already been found , can be bigger than @entity39 but orbit closer than @entity36 does our own sun , making them exceedingly hot and fascinating to study			0

an image posted to @entity22 show that all the planets of the solar system could fit between us and the moon
there would even be room to spare to fit a dwarf planet like @entity28
the amazing image highlights just how far the moon is from @entity2
professor @entity69 from the @entity71 tells @entity72 in this hypothetical line - up all the planets would *combine* into one within a week
' the enormous energy released would light up the galaxy ' he says
dr @entity112 from the @entity114 says such a scenario may not be as absurd as it sounds
he says in some systems it 's possible planets have *combine*d in such a way
this would create huge worlds known as @entity39 - some of which have already been *spotted* by @entity101
