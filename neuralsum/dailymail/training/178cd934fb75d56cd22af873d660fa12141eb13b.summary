it says much for the way things have changed at @entity3 that manager @entity4 had to cut short his post-match media duties on saturday to meet the former @entity6			1
there was a time when the most famous match - day visitor at @entity3 home games was comic @entity11			1
@entity4 , however , now moves from a royal audience to the prospect of no audience at all as his team prepare for tuesday night 's behind - closed - doors @entity18 tie with @entity19 in @entity20			1
@entity21 struck four goals for @entity3 against @entity23 on saturday as the hosts cruised to a 4 - 1 victory @entity21 takes the match ball after the game and his performance would have delighted boss @entity4 this was only the second game in @entity32 history to have four penalties			1
the other was @entity36 ’s 4 - 4 draw with @entity37 in 2000			2
it will be a peculiar experience for the city manager and his players			0
@entity19 are serving a @entity43 punishment imposed because of persistent racist chanting			2
their @entity45 will be empty when the teams meet in a game @entity4 says his team have to win if they are to qualify for the knock - out stages			1
‘ we must win if we want to continue to have options to qualify for the next stage , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i always said when you want to win something you need a team that knows how to play			2
‘ after that you need to have your best performance when you need them			0
we have very important players and they must make the difference now			0
’ @entity21 could have scored a first half hat - trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound so far , @entity3 have lost to @entity64 and drawn with @entity65 , and @entity4 said : ‘ against @entity64 we were a little unlucky			1
against @entity65 here we did n’t play well , but i hope we start now in the @entity18 playing the way we have in the last two games in the @entity32			1
’ ideally , @entity3 need two victories from back - to - back games against the @entity20			1
@entity19 warmed up for their clash with @entity3 with a 6 - 0 thrashing of @entity72			1
forwards @entity73 and @entity74 scored two goals each as the @entity20 ran riot			1
the win made sure they stayed in touch with @entity80 ’ @entity81 , who lead the @entity82 by two points			2
certainly there are question marks against the @entity87 champions in @entity43			0
saturday ’s victory over @entity23 came on the back of four goals from the splendid @entity21 and a superb display from goalkeeper @entity92			1
peculiarly , though , there remains an air of vulnerability about @entity3 when they do not have the ball			2
both @entity65 and @entity64 could have scored more goals against them , as indeed could @entity23 , and it was interesting to hear visiting manager @entity100 admit that his players had been told to exploit spaces in front of @entity3 ’s back four			1
‘ yes , we were aware of that and we tried to use it , ’ said @entity100			0
meanwhile , @entity92 acknowledged the issue while reminding his team - mates it is up to them to cope with the peculiar circumstances surrounding tuesday ’s game			2
@entity92 said : ‘ like the manager said , we are always going to score goals			2
we just have to keep down the number we let in at the other end			0
‘ it ’s just about getting the “ @entity118 ”			0
it sounds crazy , but if you have a stinker and we win , that is the main thing			2
@entity21 strokes home his fourth goal of the game and is now level with @entity126 as the top scorer @entity128 on eof the best strikers in the world - @entity130 ‘ tuesday will take me back to my @entity133 reserves days , going to play @entity134 away at @entity135 when there were @entity138 cans clattering around the pitch			1
‘ it ’s a bit different — there is a bit more on this one — but it ’s a game of football at the end of the day , whether there are 100,000 there or just the benches , it ’s no different			2
‘ you ca n’t let it affect you as a player , we have a job to do out there			0
i have massive sympathy for our fans because it was n’t us that caused this , but they are the rules and unfortunately we have to abide by them			0
i do n’t think too many of them will be bothered as long as we win			0
’ city remain a devastating side when they have the ball			0
@entity21 ’s finishing was sublime on saturday and he could even afford to miss a penalty — one of four awarded in the game — and score the goals he needed to take him past @entity173 ( 58 ) as @entity3 ’s leading scorer in the @entity32			1
he now has 61 in total			0
‘ i owe a special thanks to my team - mates and @entity3 ’s fans , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ it ’s a pride to become @entity3 ’s maximum goalscorer in @entity32 history			1
’ midfielder @entity182 should start against @entity19 after beginning as a substitute on saturday it is hard to imagine @entity21 not starting tuesday night ’s game in what are expected to be below - freezing temperatures			1
equally , midfielder @entity182 should start after beginning as a substitute on saturday			1
@entity21 's four - goal haul against @entity23 makes him @entity3 's all - time top @entity32 scorer			1
@entity21 - 61 goals ( 95 games ) @entity173 - 58 goals ( 113 games ) @entity195 - 48 goals ( 115 games ) @entity182 - 42 goals ( 141 games ) @entity200 - 37 goals ( 89 games ) @entity182 has struggled as part of a holding midfield in @entity43 this season and it may well be that he plays in @entity207 as a second striker			1
@entity3 gave the ball away carelessly at times against @entity23 and will need to be a little more resolute in @entity20			1
@entity4 added : ‘ i think we had excess of trust with the ball at our foot because we lost three or four important balls near our box , that can finish with a goal			2
‘ and in that way i am sure we will have the concentration we need first to not concede a goal			0
‘ i hope we are going to play in the same way as we did against @entity222 recently , not conceding one chance ... well , i think one chance in 90 minutes			0
‘ we must be balanced			0
football is always different and changing			0
if you are talking about the game we played today , yes , of course , it ’s not normal to me to concede or lose so many balls near our box , but if you talk to me about the ( other ) games we play we did n’t lose balls but we did n’t have clear chances to score			0
‘ so we must be a balanced team , a very concentrated team and continue playing the same way we are doing so far , maybe the year - and - a - half that i have been here			0
’ ' referee @entity234 awarded four penalties at the @entity236 but not all were correct decisions ... ' @entity239 : award was not wrong technically because there was contact but the worst decision of them all			0
@entity245 ( left ) threw himself to the ground from @entity248 ’s slight touch			0
' @entity249 : clearest of the four as @entity251 wiped out @entity252			0
' @entity253 : this was the most interesting , and watching @entity255 you can see he trips @entity257 when tracking from behind			0
it was a foul but contact was just outside the area			0
' @entity261 : @entity234 right to award it as @entity263 clearly fouls @entity21 but the red card was wrong as it was not clear and obvious that @entity21 would have met the cross or scored			2

@entity21 went past @entity173 as @entity3 's leading @entity32 scorer with 61 goals with his four strikes against @entity23
@entity4 believes @entity3 must win the game against @entity19
@entity3 have started their @entity18 campaign with a loss and a draw
@entity182 started on the bench against @entity23 , but should start in @entity20
