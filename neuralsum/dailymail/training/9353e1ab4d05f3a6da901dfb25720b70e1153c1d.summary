by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:57 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 22 january 2013 as one of the most secretive nations @entity2 remains something of an enigma to the outside world			2
but one teenage girl , who happens to be the daughter of @entity11 chief executive @entity10 , has been able to capture a rare glimpse of what life is like in the communist state and posted a revealing account along with pictures on her blog			1
@entity19 , 19 , was allowed to visit the country earlier this month with her father to promote the use of the internet			1
she describes how the group of nine , led by former @entity50 governor @entity49 , were told to leave their phones and laptops behind in @entity53 because they were warned they would be confiscated when they arrived in @entity2			2
she added : ' it 's impossible to know how much we can extrapolate from what we saw in @entity57 to what the @entity2 is really like			1
' our trip was a mixture of highly staged encounters , tightly - orchestrated viewings and what seemed like genuine human moments			1
' cold : she described her trip as very strange and very cold ; here , the frozen capital of @entity57 warm reception : despite the secretive nature of the culture and the pre-arranged photo - ops , ms @entity19 observed that the delegates all felt welcomed government state : they entered the country having left their laptops and cell phones in @entity53 because they were warned the @entity2 government would confiscate them learning experience : ms @entity19 said ordinary @entity2 live in a near - total information bubble , without any true frame of reference ; she likened it to ' @entity86 , ' but on a national scale the blog seems to suggest that a number of events they attended were staged , likening the country to @entity86 , a film starring @entity93			1
she said : ' @entity94 live in a near - total information bubble , without any true frame of reference			1
' i ca n't think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy			0
' my understanding is that @entity2 are taught to believe they are lucky to be in @entity2 , so why would they ever want to leave ? ' they 're hostages in their own country , without any real consciousness of it			2
' according to ms @entity19 the party had been told to assume that everything had been bugged , however they were ' treated very well ' ' even though official relations between the @entity110 and @entity2 are very tense			1
' dear leader : ms @entity19 said the experience at @entity113 was one of the most unsettling , stating in her blog that she did n't know whether the people were actual students chintz : she also noted that while many of the buildings they saw looked impressive , none of them were heated and many of the rooms had the strange combination of luxury and 1970s chintz austere : propaganda posters were frequent amid bleak - looking houses but the most disturbing part of the trip for ms @entity19 was visiting @entity113			1
she wrote : ' we knew nothing about what we were seeing , even as it was in front of us			0
' were they really students ? did our handlers honestly think we bought it ? did they even care ? photo op and tour completed , maybe they dismantled the whole set and went home			0
' during their trip , the delegates also paid a visit to a university in the capital to look at how @entity2 use computers			2
while university students at @entity151 and the @entity152 have carefully monitored internet access and are under strict instructions to access only educational materials most @entity2 have never surfed the web			0
matter of opinion : @entity2 are taught to believe they are lucky to be in @entity2 and they 're hostages in their own country , she wrote top secret : @entity19 ( left ) , pictured in 2009 , managed to snap some photos of the secretive state when she visited with her father @entity11 executive chairman @entity10 ( pictured right ) with former @entity50 governor @entity49 when they visited @entity2 earlier this month incredible journey : ms @entity19 , far right , joined @entity110 former new mexico state governor @entity49 , third left , and her father , @entity10 , third right , on the four - day trip computers at @entity57 's main library at the @entity175 are linked to a domestic service that allows them to read only state - run media online and access a trove of reading materials approved by @entity2 officials			1
' we knew nothing about what we were seeing , even as it was in front of us			0
did our handlers honestly think we bought it ? did they even care ? photo op completed , maybe they dismantled the whole set and went home			0
' @entity2 with computers at home can also sign up for the @entity195 service			0
mr @entity10 , who oversaw @entity11 's expansion into a global internet giant , speaks frequently about the importance of providing people around the world with internet access and technology			1
@entity11 now has offices in more than 40 countries , including all three of @entity2 's neighbors : @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity53 , another country criticized for systematic internet censorship			1
using science and technology to build @entity2 's beleaguered economy was the highlight of a @entity215 speech by leader @entity216			2
the body of @entity2 leader @entity218 lies in state at the @entity220 in @entity57 following on from @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 , the body of @entity218 has gone on display in the state mausoleum in @entity57			0
and he looks remarkably good considering he has been dead for over a year , according to visitors			0
@entity230 travel agent , who has seen the former leader , told @entity232 : ' they 've done a good job - he looks very lifelike compared to other mausoleums			2
' this was certainly a lot better than @entity222 's , which is very rushed and underwhelming experience			1
' among other items on display are his boat , the railway carriage in which he suffered his fatal heart attack in december 2011 and the @entity247 laptop he was working on when he died			0
tourist have to bow at the feet and arms of the body but not the head which is considered disrespectful			0
it is believed a team of @entity207 experts carried out the embalming process which involved removing his organs , extracting his blood and placing the body in a vat of embalming fluid .			0
