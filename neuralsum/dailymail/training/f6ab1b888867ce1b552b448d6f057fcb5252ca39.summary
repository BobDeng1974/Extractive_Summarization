it ’s already been proven that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak			0
now , scientists claim that talking to babies gives them advantages in life far beyond a larger vocabulary			0
they say that chatting to babies under the age of one , helps them make friends , as well as making them brighter because they are better able to discover the world around them			2
scientists claim that talking to babies ( illustrated with a stock image ) gives them advantages in life far beyond a larger vocabulary			0
they say that chattering to babies under the age of one , helps them make social connections , as well as improving their cognitive ability in recent years , there have been many studies about the ‘ word gap ’ – the idea that parents in impoverished homes speak less to their children , leading to their kids not achieving as much as they might at school and earning less in later life			1
but @entity31 , a psychologist at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ‘ it 's not because [ children ] have low vocabularies that they fail to achieve later on			1
that 's far too simple			0
’ ‘ the vocabulary of a child - raised in poverty or in plenty - is really an index of the larger context in which language participates			0
’ in a study published in the journal trends in @entity47 , she and @entity49 of @entity50 advocate talking to babies			1
dr @entity52 believes this is important not only because it teaches them more words , but because ‘ listening to speech promotes the babies ' acquisition of the fundamental cognitive and social psychological capacities that form the foundation for subsequent learning			2
’ the researchers say that babies who have been exposed to more human speech are better than their peers are listening to interesting sound , which allow them to pick people with whom they can communicate , as well as more easily absorb information about the world around them			1
professor @entity31 told @entity73 that babies who are ' clued in ' to language are better able to absorb information about objects and events in the world around them ( illustrated with a stock image ) professor @entity31 told @entity73 : ' because they [ babies ] are so " clued in " to language , when they are listening to language , their attention to objects and events in the world is heightened			1
' this heightened focus , or attention , promotes rapid learning and discovery			0
' she continued : ‘ these new results … tell us that infants as young as 2 or 3 months of age not only love to listen to speech , but that they learn about fundamental cognitive and social relations better in the context of listening to speech than in any other context we 've discovered yet			1
' nobody would have thought that , ’ ‘ this early tuned sensitivity to human language has positive , cascading developmental consequences that go way beyond learning language			0
' @entity105 researchers who conducted a study on the impact of bedtime reading on 7,845 nine - month - old infants , found that absent - minded conversation was four times better at improving a child 's communication skills than reading to them or showing them pictures			1
in the study , 94 per cent of infants had a parent show them pictures ; 80 per cent of nine - month - olds were read to and 66 per cent of mothers reported always talking to their children			2

@entity135 , a lecturer in psychology at @entity138 's @entity137 , told @entity139 at the @entity140 that she was surprised by the results			0
' we would have thought that there might have been a good effect of reading , perhaps more so than the talking , ' she said			0
she said that it 's easier for many parents to talk to their children regularly than devote all their attention and time to reading a book .			2

psychologists at @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity50 say it 's not just poor vocabularies that *prevent* children from achieving
babies who are spoken to are better at *spotting* people to connect with
infants as young as two months are at a cognitive advantage , study claims
babies who are ' clued in ' to language , are better able to absorb information about objects and events in the world around them
