by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 11 december 2013 @entity1 has become the first country in the world to legalise marijuana after passing a law which allows the production , sale and use of the drug			1
last night hundreds of cannabis - smoking supporters cheered and set off fireworks as they celebrated the new legislation in the centre of the capital , @entity15			1
the law permits both the large - scale distribution of marijuana and the growing of small amounts by individuals - although it will be tightly controlled by the country 's left - wing government			1
senator @entity38 , of the ruling @entity39 , said that ' the war against drugs has failed ' as he presented the bill , which was passed in the @entity43 by 16 votes out of 29			0
another senator , @entity45 , added : ' it is an historic day			0
@entity1 is now on the international forefront of this issue			1
' president @entity49 , a former guerrilla fighter , has described the legalisation plan as an experiment , saying : ' there are a lot of doubts and the doubts are legitimate			0
' but doubts should n't paralyse us in trying new paths to deal with this problem that has gripped us			0
' legal : @entity1 is the first country in the world to create a regulated market for cannabis joyful : another marijuana fan wearing a hat which trumpets his support for the government 's measure @entity1 is the first country fully to legalise the production , distribution of sale of marijuana , but several other countries have relaxed their laws against the drug in recent years			1
the @entity80 is well - known for its liberal policy on cannabis , and the capital @entity84 is full of ' coffee shops ' where residents and tourists can smoke weed , although production is still illegal			0
@entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 are among the many other states where the drug has been decriminalised for personal use , with official efforts directed against dealers and producers instead			0
last year the @entity103 states of @entity104 and @entity105 both voted to make the sale and use of marijuana legal - however , as it is still banned under federal law , the long - term functioning of the states ' laws are uncertain			2
in addition , 18 other @entity103 states allow the use of medical marijuana , and in some of those states it is so easy to obtain a licence for this that the drug is effectively decriminalised			2
the law is much more liberal than in other places which have legalised aspects of marijuana use , such as the @entity80 or the @entity103 states of @entity104 and @entity105			2
anyone over 18 will be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants each , join a cannabis club or buy up to 40 grams per month from a pharmacy , as long as they have registered with the government			1
@entity127 , an activist who has taken part in marches supporting the law , described it as ' another blow against social hypocrisy '			2
however , opposition parties have opposed the measure , while pharmacists are angry that they will have to sell marijuana			0
a poll taken in september suggested that 61 per cent of @entity1 disapprove of the law			1
legalising cannabis will ' diminish the perception of risk and foster consumption , especially among children and adolescents , ' said @entity144 , a senator from the opposition @entity145			0
' neither our government nor the rest of the world should experiment with @entity1			1
' even some drug users oppose the measure , because they argue that the government controls on marijuana are overly restrictive			1
@entity154 : the production of marijuana is currently illegal worldwide , although some countries have relaxed their anti-drug laws in recent years ' it 's invasive , because it is not up to the government to determine how much marijuana can be consumed and the quality , ' said @entity163 , the author of a book on ' @entity165 '			2
the @entity166 , which oversees international treaties on drugs , has warned that the law violates the @entity170 , adopted in 1961 by @entity1 and 185 other countries			1
but following decades of drug - related violence throughout @entity177 , a number of former leaders from the region have endorsed the plan			0
mr @entity38 insisted that the law will do nothing more than recognise what is already happening around the country			0
' marijuana is the illegal drug that is most consumed , fundamentally by young people , one that is perceived as extremely low risk and is easily obtained , ' he said			0
the government has accompanied the law with a publicity campaign featuring the slogan , ' all drug consumption has risks			2

law will allow users to buy marijuana if register with the government
activists take to the streets of @entity15 to celebrate *landmark* legislation
but the law could put @entity1 in breach of international anti-drug treaty
