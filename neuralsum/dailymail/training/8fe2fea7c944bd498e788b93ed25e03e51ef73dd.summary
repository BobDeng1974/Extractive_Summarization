@entity8 crumpled on a court bench in tears today as he lost a case for up to £ 300,000 - which he will have to pay out of his own pocket because he had no car insurance			1
the claim was brought by trainee plumber @entity16 , who was just 18 when he was blinded in one eye and given severe head injuries during the late - night row outside a @entity20 's in 2010			1
a judge heard the argument began with the actor refusing to let mr @entity16 use his phone - and led to him splitting with his then - girlfriend , skins star @entity25 , three years later			1

but mr @entity32 ruled in the plumber 's favour , telling the @entity0 : ' the decision to which i have come is that mr @entity16 succeeds in his claim against mr @entity8 for battery '			1
although he was cautioned and interviewed on suspicion of attempted murder , mr @entity8 's only criminal conviction in court was to be fined £ 750 for driving without insurance , the court heard			1
mr @entity16 , now 22 , insisted that mr @entity8 caused his head injuries outside the restaurant in @entity46 , north @entity47 , which prompted a permanent personality change			1

mr @entity32 will give detailed reasons for his decision at a later date			0

' he is incredibly kind to his family and they are a wonderful family who welcomed me in '			0

' mr @entity8 wiped away tears as his ex-girlfriend spoke , his face crumpling with emotion as he watched her on the screen			2
telling the judge about the incident , she said that when she next saw her ex-boyfriend at her north @entity47 flat , his first thoughts were for her and the badly injured mr @entity16			1
' @entity8 was immediately concerned for @entity16 's well being , ' she said			2
' i have never seen him be aggressive to anyone			0
' he was very shaken up and frightened , and above all concerned for me that i had been attacked			0

' couple : shameless star @entity8 and his then - girlfriend , skins star @entity25 , split in 2013 she also told the judge that she had bumped into mr @entity16 , who lives in the same area of north @entity47 in which she grew up , twice in nightclubs since the incident			1

' he said we ruined his chance of being on @entity136 , on @entity3 , and he was devastated about that			0
' mr @entity8 , who played @entity138 in @entity2 , previously described the trainee plumber as ' harassing ' his then - girlfriend before the alleged attack			1
she told the judge : ' i felt him following me , which is something i find intimidating , and he was very loud and aggressive			0
scene : the incident happened nearly five years ago outside this @entity77 in @entity46 , north @entity47 ' i was an 18 - year - old girl on her own being followed by a large man , shouting			1
it was very traumatic and dramatic for me			0
