an artist from @entity1 has created clothes that play music when a converted @entity4 is rubbed across the surface of specially made ' sonic fabric			1
' sound designer @entity7 developed the denim - style sonic material by weaving cassette tape through polyester thread			1
she then converted an old @entity4 into a sonic fabric reader and when the reader is rubbed over the fabric it creates futuristic - sounds , which @entity7 describes as ' like scratching five records backwards at once			1
she calls the denim - style material ' sonic fabric ' and its made from weaving cassette tape through polyester thread remove the faceplate			1
find the playhead and remove excess plastic using small needlenosed pliers			0
remove the head using a scredriver or tweezers			0
get a small piece of wood - @entity7 uses half of a wooden clothes peg			0
glue the wood to the playhead but do n't glue down the play button			0
plug in headphones , press play and put the @entity4 upside down on top of the fabric			1
drag it over the material to create the sound			2
@entity7 has now launched a range of neckties made from her sonic fabric that are hand - sewn in @entity47 by designer @entity48			1
the sonic fabric works because the spools of cassette tape are magnetic			1
when the head of a tape player is rubbed over this magnetic material the sound is amplified			1
the fabric retains it 's magnetic properties throughout the weaving process			1
@entity7 originally designed the material to be a piece of art but has since used it in bags , dresses and now ties			2
early versions of the fabric contained tapes from @entity68 and @entity69 , as well as wildlife recordings			1
@entity7 began by trying to knit with the fabric but said it was too loose and flimsy to work with			2
she then asked a weaver friend to try using the tape on a loom at the @entity76			0
the sonic fabric is 50 per cent polyester thread and 50 per cassette tape			1
the sonic fabric works because the spools of cassette tape are magnetic			1
when the head of a tape player is rubbed over this magnetic material a sound is amplified through headphones or a connected amp @entity88 fabric is woven on a 1940 's dobby loom at a textile mill in @entity91			1
the @entity92 has a special shuttle capable of handling the cassette tape @entity7 said : ' the product astounded both of us			0
' we never expected such a beautiful , tightly - woven , functional material			0
' @entity88 fabric for larger projects is woven on a 1940 ’s dobby loom at a small family run textile mill in @entity91			0
the loom has a special shuttle capable of handling the audiobook cassette tape			0
when the 1/8inch wide strands of cassette tape get folded as they go into the loom they are squashed into the the fabric			2
about 20 strands are squashed into an inch of polyester fabric			2
@entity7 said that an average - width tape head is capable of picking up maybe 5 or 6 strands of tape at a time			0
the large spools of tape used in the weaving process are taken from audiobook tapes from nearby companies			2
@entity7 has now launched a range of neckties made from her sonic fabric that is hand - sewn in @entity47 by designer @entity48			1
larger projects are weaved on a loom at a textile mill in @entity91 because the audiobook tapes are recorded with a single note , the fabric makes a single clear tone that can be adjusted according to the speed at which the player is rubbed along the fabric			1
@entity7 's idea for the fabric was inspired by the small strands of cassette tape that were tied to sailboats she used to race when she was younger			2
the strips of tape were used to see which direction the wind was travelling in and @entity7 said the material was ideal as ' tell - tails ' because ' it is light and very sensitive to the wind , it ’s extremely durable , and it dries quickly			0
' she said she used to imagine that if the wind hit the tell - tails just right , the sounds of whatever had been recorded onto the tape could be heard wafting out into the air			0
@entity7 was then inspired by the colourful flags hung by @entity154			0
@entity7 designed the first sonic shaman - superhero dress for a show in 2003 , pictured			0
it was made by weaving together 100 individual cassette tapes			1
@entity7 has previously used tape spools by @entity68 and @entity69 , as well as audiobook cassettes in the material @entity163 prayer flags are made of colorful squares of cotton fabric imprinted with the images of mantras , or sacred sounds			1
they are hung outdoors where the breeze blowing through them can ' activate ' the built - in sounds			0
she designed the first sonic shaman - superhero dress for a show in 2003 and was made by weaving together 100 individual cassette tapes			1
that same year @entity7 made percussionist @entity175 a ' musical suit ' that he played live on stage with his band @entity178 during a show in @entity180			0
the tape used in this project was made from @entity175 's tape collection including @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and more			0
@entity7 's idea for the fabric was inspired by the small strands of cassette tape that were tied to sailboats she used to race when she was younger			2
@entity7 used this inspiration for her sonic fabric sailboat sails art installation , pictured , at the @entity195 in @entity196 @entity7 said : ' it would be thrilling to work with other sound artists and musicians around the world to literally weave together our sonic experiences during these times of powerful transformation in the realms of society , politics , and the environment			1
' the resulting fabric could be shared and made into anything imaginable by anyone interested			2
' @entity7 also makes sailboat sails as art installations from the material			0
she told @entity215 that she has collaborated with a designer friend on a line of small , wearable accessories			0
@entity48 hand sews neckties , small bags , and other custom pieces for anyone who would like to have a functional work of conceptual art that can be used as part of ' everyday life ' .			0
