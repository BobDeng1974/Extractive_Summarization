during her 24 - week pregnancy scan , @entity6 says medics at @entity9 told her the child would have ‘ no hope of survival ’			1
ms @entity6 went through the agony of taking tablets to abort her unborn son , only to be told doctors were going to try and deliver her baby			1

’ now , the mother of two , along with partner @entity27 , 25 , has begun legal proceedings against @entity9 , after claiming she was told her baby ’s brain had not formed properly , her only option was a termination and that her child could be born with one eye			1
as a result of being born so early , ms @entity6 says @entity18 , now 15 - months - old , has suffered a catalogue of health problems including chronic lung issues and a cyst on the brain			1
she said : ‘ if i had been allowed to go longer into the pregnancy , i am sure he would n’t have had any of these problems			0
‘ now , despite being told he was brain dead , @entity18 ’s brain is on par with any other baby of his age			1
‘ despite what they said , he was born breathing and kicking			0
‘ when i look at him now , i ca n’t believe what almost happened because someone made a presumption from a scan			0
‘ i just want other mothers to know my story so that nothing like this happens again			0
’ ms @entity6 says that she was given drugs to abort @entity18 ( pictured ) but that when they failed to work another doctor said that he needed to be delivered			1
he was born prematurely weighing just 1lb 7oz ms @entity6 went for her 24 - week scan on may 4 last year			1
supported by her mother , @entity65 , 66 , medics took her into a consulting room where ms @entity6 says she was told her baby ’s brain had not formed			1
‘ i just broke down in tears , ’ she recalled			0
‘ my mum asked if the baby would survive , and we were told there was no hope of survival			2
‘ they said i could take tablets or be sent through to @entity79 ’s @entity78 where they could perform a foetal heart stop			0
’ left overnight to consider her options , ms @entity6 slept little and finally decided to take the tablets			2
ms @entity6 said : ' it breaks my heart every day when i look at my son and think how i almost got rid of him			2
' image shows @entity9 where ms @entity6 says she was told @entity18 was brain dead ‘ i took them believing that a termination was the only way			1
they even told me they would have to carry out a post mortem examination to find out what had gone wrong			0
‘ by wednesday , may 9 , i was back at the hospital because the tablets did n’t seem to be working			0
‘ i was seen by another medic who asked if i ’d spoken to a neo-natal doctor			0
‘ i said “ no ” and he seemed flabbergasted			0
so they sent for one who then examined me and said he was going to deliver my baby			0
’ @entity103 was born on thursday , may 10 , weighing just 1lb 7oz			1
he was immediately put on a ventilator and also suffered an almost fatal infection and heart condition			0
a spokeswoman for @entity9 said : ' @entity108 can confirm that it is aware of the legal action being taken by ms @entity6 and it would be clearly inappropriate to offer any detail or comment on the case at this present time ' however , after almost two months in the neo-natal unit , he started to show signs of recovery			2
ms @entity6 , also mother to six - month - old @entity118 , said : ‘ i still find it hard to believe they could get it so wrong , that it was just presumed my baby would not survive			2
‘ when i look at him now and think what could have happened , it brings me to tears			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity9 said : ‘ @entity108 can confirm that it is aware of the legal action being taken by ms @entity6 and her partner and it would be clearly inappropriate to offer any detail or comment on the case at this present time			2
‘ @entity108 recognises that this is a distressing time for both ms @entity6 and her partner			2

mother - of - two @entity6 is suing @entity136
says that during her 24 - week scan she was told baby @entity18 was ' brain dead ' , had just one eye and had ' no chance of survival '
she claims that doctors advised her to take termination drugs
when they did *n't* work , she saw another doctor at the hospital who told her the baby needed to be delivered immediately
@entity18 was born weighing just 1lb 7oz with both eyes and now , at 15 - months - old , he is developing as any other boy his age would
his premature birth has left him with chronic lung problems however
