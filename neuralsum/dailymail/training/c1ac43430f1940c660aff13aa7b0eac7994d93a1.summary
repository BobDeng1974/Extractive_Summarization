bright stars top @entity2 trees in @entity4 homes around much of the world			0
the faithful sing about the @entity7 that guided the wise men to a manger in the little town of @entity11 , where @entity12 was born			1
they 're commemorating the @entity14 described by the @entity15 in the @entity16			2
but is the star 's biblical description a pious fiction or does it contain some astronomical truth ? bright stars top @entity2 trees in @entity4 homes around much of the world ( right )			2
but is the star 's biblical description a pious fiction or does it contain some astronomical truth ? according to one expert , it is the three wise men , motivated by this ' star in the east , ' first travelled to @entity30 and told @entity31 the prophecy that a new ruler of the people of @entity35 would be born			1
@entity31 , asked the wise men when the star had appeared , because he and his court , apparently , were unaware of any such star in the sky			1
these events present us with our first astronomy puzzle of the first @entity2 : how could @entity31 's own advisors have been unaware of a star so bright and obvious that it could have led the wise men to @entity30 ? next , in order to reach @entity11 , the wise men had to travel directly south from @entity30 ; somehow that ' star in the east ' ' went before them , ' til it came and stood over where the young child was			1
' the three wise men , motivated by this ' star in the east , ' first travelled to @entity30 and told @entity31 the prophecy that a new ruler of the people of @entity35 would be born			1
@entity31 , asked the wise men when the star had appeared , because he and his court , apparently , were unaware of any such star in the sky now we have our second first - @entity2 astronomy puzzle : how can a star ' in the east ' guide our wise men to the south ? the north star guides lost hikers to the north , so should n't a star in the east have led the wise men to the east ? astronomer @entity71 points out that ' in the east ' is a literal translation of the @entity74 phrase en te anatole , which was a technical term used in @entity74 mathematical astrology 2,000 years ago			1
it described , very specifically , a planet that would rise above the eastern horizon just before the sun would appear			1
then , just moments after the planet rises , it disappears in the bright glare of the sun in the morning sky			1
except for a brief moment , no one can see this ' star in the east			0
' according to the timings , the star may in fact have been @entity91 , which appeared and disappeared in the sky around the time of @entity12 ' birth			1
and we have yet a third first - @entity2 astronomy puzzle : how does @entity15 's star move ' before them , ' like the tail lights on the snowplow you might follow during a blizzard , and then stop and stand over the manger in @entity11 , inside of which supposedly lies the infant @entity12 ? what could the ' star in the east ' be ? the astronomer in me knows that no star can do these things , nor can a comet , or @entity91 , or a supernova , or a conjunction of planets or any other actual bright object in the nighttime sky			1
one can claim that @entity15 's words describe a miracle , something beyond the laws of physics			0
but @entity15 chose his words carefully and wrote ' star in the east ' twice , which suggests that these words hold a specific importance for his readers			0
can we find any other explanation , consistent with @entity15 's words , that does n't require that the laws of physics be violated and that has something to do with astronomy ? the answer , amazingly , is yes			0
astronomer @entity71 points out that ' in the east ' is a literal translation of the @entity74 phrase en te anatole , which was a technical term used in @entity74 mathematical astrology 2,000 years ago			1
how could @entity31 's own advisors have been unaware of a star so bright that it could have led the wise men to @entity30 ? according to professor @entity142 , this may be because it disappeared briefly it described , very specifically , a planet that would rise above the eastern horizon just before the sun would appear			1
then , just moments after the planet rises , it disappears in the bright glare of the sun in the morning sky			1
except for a brief moment , no one can see this ' star in the east			0
' according to professor @entity142 , if @entity15 's wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king , the bright star did n't guide them ; it only told them when to set out			1
and they would n't have found an infant swaddled in a manger			0
after all , the baby was already eight months old by the time they decoded the astrological message they believed predicted the birth of a future king			0
the portent began on april 17 of 6 b.c. with the heliacal rising of @entity91 that morning , followed , at noon , by its lunar occultation in the constellation @entity174			2
it lasted until december 19 of 6 b.c. when @entity91 stopped moving to the west , stood still briefly , and began moving to the east , as compared with the fixed background stars			2
by the earliest time the men could have arrived in @entity11 , the baby @entity12 would likely have been at least a toddler			1
he claims @entity15 may have written to convince his readers that @entity12 was the prophesied messiah			0
given the astrological clues embedded in his gospel , he must have believed the story of the @entity14 would be convincing evidence for many in his audience			0
for background , virtually all the stars remain fixed in their places ; the stars rise and set every night , but they do not move relative to each other			0
the stars in the @entity197 appear year after year always in the same place			0
but the planets , the sun , and the moon wander through the fixed stars			0
though the planets , sun and moon move along approximately the same path through the background stars , they travel at different speeds , so they often lap each other			0
when the sun catches up with a planet , we ca n't see the planet , but when the sun passes far enough beyond it , the planet reappears			2
and now we need a little bit of astrology background			0
when the planet reappears again for the first time , and rises in the morning sky just moments before the sun , for the first time in many months			1
that moment is known to astrologers as a heliacal rising			0
a heliacal rising , that special first reappearance of a planet , is what en te anatole referred to in ancient @entity74 astrology			1
in particular , the reappearance of a planet like @entity91 was thought by @entity74 astrologers to be symbolically significant for anyone born on that day			1
thus , the ' star in the east ' refers to an astronomical event with supposed astrological significance in the context of ancient @entity74 astrology			2
what about the star parked directly above the first cr√®che ? it refers to a particular moment when a planet stops moving and changes apparent direction from westward to eastward motion			0
this occurs when the @entity248 , which orbits the sun more quickly than @entity250 or @entity91 or @entity251 , catches up with , or laps , the other planet			2
according to the timings , the star may in fact have been @entity91 , which appeared and disappeared in the sky around the time of @entity12 ' birth together , a rare combination of astrological events would have suggested to ancient @entity74 astrologers a regal horoscope and a royal birth			1
@entity15 's wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king , the bright star did n't guide them ; it only told them when to set out			1
and they would n't have found an infant swaddled in a manger			0
after all , the baby was already eight months old by the time they decoded the astrological message they believed predicted the birth of a future king			0

by the earliest time the men could have arrived in @entity11 , the baby @entity12 would likely have been at least a toddler			2
this article by professor @entity142 of @entity290 in @entity291 originally appeared in @entity292 .			0

according to the @entity16 , @entity31 , asked the wise men when the star had appeared , because he was unaware of any such star
astronomers have also been baffled by how @entity31 did n't know of such a bright star , and how a star ' in the east ' could guide men south
but ' in the east ' is a literal translation of the @entity74 phrase en te anatole
this describes when a planet that would rise above the eastern horizon just before the sun would appear , and then disappear in the morning sky
if this was the case , however , the wise men would have been guided by @entity91 would n't have arrived until @entity12 was eight months old
