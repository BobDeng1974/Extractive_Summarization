@entity1 football board chairman @entity0 has confirmed @entity2 has been hired as a consultant by the @entity5 club			1
the former @entity7 managing director jetted into @entity8 on monday night before holding talks with the @entity11 board on tuesday morning			1
@entity2 is a close ally of @entity12 and had been expected to replace @entity13 - who resigned on monday - as chief executive			1
new @entity1 consultant @entity2 makes his way into @entity5 on tuesday billionaire sports direct tycoon @entity12 - who owns around nine per cent of @entity1 , runs their retail division and holds naming rights to the @entity5 - has put himself in an even better position to control the crisis - hit club after they accepted his £ 2million loan offer			1
the terms give him security over the @entity28 and @entity29 facility next to @entity5 - and crucially the right to pick two new board members			2
but @entity0 told @entity32 that @entity2 is being brought in as a consultant , rather than as a new board member			1
he said : ' i 've not had any discussions with him			0
as far as i am aware he is a consultant at the moment			2
' meanwhile , the @entity42 supporters ' coalition group has slammed chairman @entity39 and directors @entity38 - brother of @entity44 for backing @entity12 's rescue bid			2
the cameras are on @entity47 as he arrives at @entity5 to take up his new role as consultant @entity50 had promised the cash - strapped @entity8 giants a £ 16million investment package but in return demanded control of the club			1
that bid was rebuffed last week , as was an 11th - hour loan from @entity60 owner @entity59 which was worth £ 3million			0
the fans ' statement read : ' the @entity1 support and the club itself has once again been betrayed by those tasked with overseeing the health and success of our great football club			0
' the decision by the @entity72 board , mr @entity39 , mr @entity38 and mr @entity44 , to effectively hand control of the club to @entity12 in return for a £ 2m , short term loan , is an absolute disgrace			1
' they have acted in a cowardly way and have been bullied by @entity12 and @entity79 into giving them precisely what they want with no regard for the club			1
@entity1 board chairman @entity0 is mobbed by the press as he leaves @entity5 on tuesday ' the club was at a crossroads			1
the board had to decide whether to take us down the route of a long term , £ 16m , sustainable investment and the start of a process where fans could once again trust those tasked with nursing @entity1 back to health			0
' instead they have handed @entity12 control of the boardroom for a pittance which will now have to be repaid out of the pockets of the dwindling number of @entity1 fans who still choose to support this regime financially			2
' they have neglected their duty to shareholders , fans and the club itself			0
their cowardly act now means we are likely to see mr @entity117 long term control of the club 's remaining commercial income without having to actually invest a penny			0
' the board has , through a policy of inaction and cooperation with @entity79 's shareholder group , allowed a situation to develop where corporate vultures are grabbing what assets they can			0
' there is no long term plan			0
we simply limp from one short term fix to another , each time giving away more of the family silver , despite a clear alternative being available			0
@entity2 ( right ) with @entity7 manager @entity140 during a club announcement in october 2012 ' @entity79 's pronouncement that the plc board ' did their duty and their due diligence accordingly ' and have done ' what 's in the best interests of the fans , the club and the shareholders ' is the type of laughable nonsense we have come to expect from him			1
' mr @entity0 certainly got what he wanted which was the retention of his seat in the director 's box and his club tie			2
the club and the fans have been sold down the river and this is another kick in the teeth for both them and the reputable shareholders still involved at @entity1			0
' mr @entity0 , rather than disingenuous statements , should explain to fans why he actively blocked a £ 16m investment that could have taken the club forward			0
' it is now a matter of individual conscience for fans if they wish to continue to fund the corporate pillaging of our football club			0
they should be under no illusions however that every time they purchase a single item in either @entity185 or our club shops , they are paying for the privilege of allowing @entity12 to strengthen his grip on our commercial operations in a move which could hamstring the club for a generation			1
' also for the remainder of this season , every match ticket they buy will be used to pay mr @entity12 back the money he has lent for control of our club			2
effectively they will be paying him for the privilege of his power grab			0
' @entity7 owner @entity12 ( centre ) watches the club 's match at @entity209 on sunday			1

@entity2 has been hired as a consultant by the @entity5 club
the former @entity7 managing director is a close ally of @entity12
