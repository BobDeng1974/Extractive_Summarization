@entity5 shot his wife @entity6 twice in the back and then turned the gun on himself in a botched suicide attempt , in @entity10 , @entity11			1
now a report by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) said @entity31 needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases now a report by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) said @entity31 needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases			1
it made four main findings - saying officers responding to incidents involving the couple did not have ' all the relevant information ' about their past history			2
it also said police should have given greater consideration to @entity17 's coercive behaviour and carried out more checks on his firearms license			2
@entity30 commissioner @entity55 said : ' this was a callous , brutal murder that devastated @entity6 's family and friends			1
' our investigation found weaknesses and shortcomings in how @entity31 handled this case and it is not the first time the @entity30 has raised concerns over how the force responds to domestic abuse cases			1
' the force has given a higher priority to domestic abuse cases , but i am urging senior officers again to ensure they take all necessary steps to improve their performance			0
the shooting took place on august 8 , 2013			0
mrs @entity17 had been living in the city after moving out of the home she shared with her husband six miles away in @entity82 , near @entity83			0
but despite being told on april 12 their relationship was over , @entity17 refused to accept his marriage had ended and was ' convinced ' she still had feelings for him			0
he kept his wife under surveillance and was described as a man ' not prepared to let go '			2
in the weeks leading up to tragedy , he repeatedly texted , phoned and even followed his wife			1
on the day in question , mrs @entity17 was leaving for work when something suddenly caused her to stop and open the boot of her red @entity99			0
it was then her estranged husband got out of his @entity102 and pulled the trigger three times			0
@entity105 later found the couple 's bloodied bodies lying side by side on the road			0
mrs @entity17 was pronounced dead at the @entity111			0
@entity17 , who put the shotgun under his jaw , survived - but with substantial injuries			0
the @entity30 said its report looked at how @entity31 had dealt with three incidents in the run up to the murder			1
it highlighted that officers had failed to make referrals to the @entity122 , which might have led to @entity5 's firearms licence being withdrawn before the fatal shooting			1
pictured here is the scene after the shootings			0
a report by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) said @entity31 needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases the @entity30 's investigation concluded one officer had a case to answer for misconduct			1
@entity31 said they had ' already dealt with the matter ' it also said a risk assessment should have classified @entity17 as being ' at high risk of serious harm ' and more consideration ' should have been given to @entity5 's coercive and controlling behaviour '			1
another problem the @entity30 found was the way in which it had a ratings system called ' firearms warning markers '			2
the watchdog said : ' markers only appeared on incident logs if the report was made from the address to which the firearms certificate was registered			2
' victims of domestic abuse who are estranged from their partners will invariably live at a different address , and so may not benefit from the degree of protection given by such markers which are important in alerting officers to a potential risk			0
