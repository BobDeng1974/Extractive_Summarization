by political correspondent published : 18:59 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 01:39 est , 17 september 2012 @entity1 yesterday threw down the gauntlet to @entity3 by calling for tough union reforms to combat strikes			1
the @entity7 mayor warned it was time to stop the ‘ endless buggeration ’ that disrupts public services amid fresh threats of a general strike by union barons			1
his proposal raised eyebrows in @entity17 – especially as he caved in to union demands for bonuses worth up to £ 35million to transport workers threatening to strike over the @entity21			0
speaking out : @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to @entity3 last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a general strike but unveiling an anti-strike blueprint , mr @entity1 has now called for strikes to be outlawed unless a 50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote			1
the @entity7 mayor also wants to ban all - out strikes among key public service workers such as paramedics , firemen and transport staff , forcing them to maintain a basic service , and stop strikers intimidating workers			1
the proposals will be seen as further evidence of mr @entity1 ’s ambition to succeed @entity3 as @entity45 leader			1
battles : @entity1 has clashed repeatedly with @entity47 , pictured , the leader of the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) union and one of the last old - style militant union barons his supporters say his proposals are the ‘ @entity56 equivalent ’ of the union reforms pioneered by @entity58 and @entity59 in the 1980s			2
mr @entity1 insisted the measures would help mr @entity3 ’s drive to boost the economy and dismissed reports he was plotting his downfall as ‘ twaddle ’			1
he told @entity66 : ‘ we ’re going through difficult economic times			0
‘ it [ a general strike ] would be damaging to the economy , it ’s not in the interests of unions or their members and it is unlikely to carry much support			0
‘ what we do n’t want to see as unions start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological burden on people who do n’t want to take strike action			2
there are hard - working people on @entity7 ’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on			2
‘ there are intimidating people who stop them getting to work , or a strike is called on the basis of a very small proportion of the relevant workforce			0
’ he insisted that it was ‘ not realistic ’ to introduce a total ban on strikes			0
but he said : ‘ what it does is take away unions ’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration			0
’ @entity110 is understood to be dismissive of mr @entity1 ’s plans and wants a more ‘ watered down ’ version			1
a @entity114 insider said : ‘ most unions are a busted flush			0
' if we give @entity1 everything he wants , it could backfire			0

the @entity7 mayor called on @entity3 to pull @entity122 out of the *slump* by *clamping* down on strikes
@entity1 said reports that he was plotting @entity3 ’s downfall were ‘ twaddle ’
but he *refused* to rule out a @entity131 return before the next *election* , *due* in 2015
