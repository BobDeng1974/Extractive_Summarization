two ice fisherman were in for a big surprise when the reeled in a live bird from freezing waters in northwestern @entity4 earlier this week			1
in a video titled , ' shocking ice fishing video from @entity4 ! ' , @entity5 filmed his friend @entity8 pulling a live red - breasted merganser out of a hole in a large sheet of ice in monday			1
red - breasted mergansers dive into the water while foraging for food and can usually stay under for a little under a minute - so the fisherman pulled up the line at the perfect moment			1
catch of the day : three men were ice fishing in northwest @entity4 when the caught a red - breasted merganser on their line as it was diving for food @entity8 , who was fishing for muskies with @entity5 and friend @entity25 , told @entity26 that he realized immediately that he was n't pulling up a fish , but he was n't expecting a bird			1
' i was n't exactly certain what flashed passed the hole , there were colors that just did n't set well with me so i was hesitant of grabbing something i had n't yet identified , ' he wrote in an e-mail interview			2
' [ it ] was n't until i saw feathers that i realized what was going on			2
' ' my jaw hit the ice , ' @entity5 told the @entity41			2
' i was absolutely shocked			0
' @entity5 said that though he and his friends go fishing regularly and have seen mergansers dive under water for long stretches of time , he was n't expecting to catch the bird on his fishing line			1
' i 've never heard of anything like this happening , ' he told the @entity41			0
' it was so unusual			0
' in the video , @entity8 can be seen pulling up the fishing line out of a small hole in the water until he eventually reaches his hand in and pulls out a squirming live bird			1
unexpected : @entity8 , pictured on monday , said he was n't sure what he was pulling up on the line , but he was certain it was n't a fish unusual : @entity8 was hesitant to reach into the water at first , but he grabbed the merganser and likely saved it from drowning on the end of the fishing line after @entity8 posed for a picture , the men untangled the bird and set it free into it 's natural habitat			1
' it did n't take long to realize it was n't happy , i just grabbed the mean end as soon as i saw the chance , ' @entity8 wrote in an e-mail			2
' i figured controlling its head and body would make unhooking and tangling much faster , i treated it the same as i would a fish			0
thankfully @entity85 was there to help , it would have been a difficult task to accomplish alone , ' he added			0
@entity5 told the @entity41 that the bird was only minimally tangled and easily made its way back to its flock			2
@entity8 said that he had never heard of people catching a merganser through the ice , but said that it occasionally happens ' in open water in ares where large amounts of water birds like to congregate '			1
the three fishermen do n't kill anything that they catch while fishing and release it all back into the wild			2
' i would just sincerely like to say that the environment , the fish the birds - that 's what 's high priority , ' @entity5 told the @entity41			2
catch - and - release : red - breasted mergansers dive into the water looking for food			1
the men untangled the bird from their fishing line and set it free to return to its flock @entity8 said that there 's ' no sense in killing ' the fish they catch , and that you never know a fish 's full potential if it 's killed			1
' i 've seen and have caught fish i 've released even years prior that have had identifying scars or characteristics that could n't be mistaken , ' he said			0
' when you experience catching a fish that you 've caught before it is a good feeling to see that the fish is still alive and well			0
it gives you that much more incentive to let them all go , ' he added			0
the three men often fish for musky , a rare and large species that is known to be difficult to catch			0
the freshwater fish is often spotted around the @entity136 and through @entity137			0

the men estimated that the fish was about 30 years old			0
they were one pound away from matching a 1949 state record for biggest musky catch			0
@entity8 that that three days prior to catching the merganser , he had another unusual bird encounter			1
' i watched a bald eagle wipe out a @entity137 goose and carried it as far as it could until it realized it was extremely heavy , ' he wrote			0
' it just so happened it dropped less than ten yards from where i was quietly sitting waiting for a flag to pop. ' ' most would find this crazy uncommon , but for me it 's just a typical day on water , ' the fisherman said			0
