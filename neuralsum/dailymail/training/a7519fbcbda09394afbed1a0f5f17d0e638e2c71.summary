@entity0 thought it might be time to make it a @entity2 and for a while it seemed like the usual movers and shakers had decided to take deadline day off			1
there were revelations from @entity10 that @entity11 had returned to @entity12 and an outburst from @entity15 ’s girlfriend , who claimed they had been forced out of @entity17 as the @entity19 full back rejoined @entity20 , but it was a slow start to business			2
@entity23 arrived at @entity24 with a blank stare and a black bin - liner and the cogs were greased and started to whirl			2
@entity29 's signing of @entity31 star @entity30 was the biggest deal of transfer deadline day @entity23 looked less impressed to be joining strugglers @entity24 on loan from @entity35 @entity29 added @entity36 @entity31 star @entity30 to their squad for £ 27million , the biggest deal of the month , just ahead of @entity40 ’s transfer from @entity41 to @entity42			1
@entity43 really got the momentum rolling in the @entity46 market as manager @entity47 and chairman @entity48 created space in the squad by finding homes for unwanted players			2
among them , @entity53 , who began the day as a @entity55 target , seemed to be heading to @entity57			2
@entity58 were keen to take left back @entity59 in return but the clubs could not get that deal over the line			2
having missed @entity53 , @entity55 bid £ 3m for @entity65 ’s @entity64 but could not convince boss @entity66 to agree on his first day in the job at the @entity68 , even though @entity65 were desperate for the money			1
@entity58 ’s @entity70 was pursued by @entity71 of @entity72 , for £ 3.8m , a significant loss on their £ 10m club - record signing , but that deal also fell through			1
@entity47 had hoped for a day akin to last january when he bagged four deadline signings at @entity78			1
this time he needed an extention to push through their deal for @entity83 midfielder @entity82 , but a move for @entity86 ’s @entity85 also collapsed late on			1
@entity82 's move from @entity83 was one of the few deals @entity58 managed to complete @entity91 ( right ) , playing against @entity90 in november , has joined @entity92 on loan @entity94 , who joined @entity58 for free on a two - year deal in august , was last night heading to @entity96 after failing to start a game			1
@entity58 epitomised what has become a self - sustaining cycle of spending , where time and energy are burned desperately trying to sell the expensive errors of judgment from previous windows			0
all under the pressure of a ticking clock and financial fair play			0
‘ it is the poker room of last resort , ’ according to former @entity119 chairman @entity118 on @entity120 5 @entity121 again , someone at @entity110 was devoting time to finding a home for @entity112 , who had fallen out with @entity113 during a loan at @entity20			0
when a proposed move back to @entity123 collapsed , he emerged as a viable alternative for any team seeking a high - maintenance striker but unable to afford @entity127			0
@entity128 tore up @entity130 ’s £ 40,000 - a - week contract , tried unsuccessfully to loan @entity131 to @entity133 and found @entity91 was reluctant to be rushed out			1
@entity35 , @entity119 , @entity24 and @entity134 all failed before @entity92 tempted him to @entity136			1
@entity138 boss @entity137 said : ‘ @entity91 represents a real boost in terms of attacking options			2
his pace and trickery will fit in well			0
’ @entity134 decided they would like @entity144 , rather than @entity145 , from @entity86 but the deal collapsed			2
@entity147 travelled from @entity119 to @entity148 and sealed a move to his fifth club in little more than a year			0
a promising career has lost its way in this blur of money			0
other clubs worked hard to hold on to their players , like @entity41 with @entity157 , who , after a month of discontent , confirmed he would stay			0
‘ even if i was sad before , because i did n’t play a lot , now everything is different , ’ @entity157 said on @entity160			0
‘ i believe in this team and this project			0
’ @entity55 ’s @entity165 also went on @entity160 to reveal he was watching @entity166			0
he was a movie - goer not a mover , at least not yet			0
after an impressive debut season in the @entity46 , @entity165 will clinch a good move when his contract expires in the summer			0
@entity172 and @entity173 are interested			0
@entity83 swallowed a loss of millions on @entity175 , signed two years ago from @entity78 for £ 15m and loaned back to help them win promotion			1
at the time , @entity177 and @entity128 wanted the winger , who has returned to @entity179 for just £ 6m			1
@entity181 clubs were committed to a total of £ 80m of spending at start of play , £ 15m down on the same point last year , when another £ 35m was spent on deadline day			1
@entity175 ended his @entity83 nightmare by returning to @entity78 for a knockdown fee @entity128 have invested for the future with a deal for @entity193 wonderkid @entity192 monday 's figures were boosted by the @entity196 deal			1
@entity29 took care to stay within @entity199 limits with the £ 24m sale of @entity201 to @entity202 and a loan fee for @entity204 , who joined @entity205			1
@entity204 arrived at @entity29 from @entity206 12 months ago in what looks increasingly a signing designed to stop him joining title rivals @entity172			1
@entity210 never warmed to his style			0
@entity128 invested £ 5m in @entity192 from @entity193 , heading off @entity17 and @entity212			1
@entity213 tried to dazzle @entity214 with a £ 5m bid for @entity216 , but without success			1
down the divisions , @entity219 were active , @entity218 paid @entity221 a seven - figure fee for @entity223 , @entity224 ’s top scorer , and @entity225 is back			0
the @entity226 represented five @entity181 clubs in nine years before leaving @entity228 , three years ago			0
now he is back , via @entity230 and @entity72 , signing for @entity231 and still only 32			2
‘ the yak is ready to go , ’ he beamed from @entity232 .			0

@entity29 *funded* @entity30 signing by selling @entity201
@entity92 manged to lure out of *favour* @entity91 away from @entity128
@entity175 completed his escape from @entity83 to @entity78
@entity128 invested for the future with a £ 5m deal for @entity193 ' @entity192
