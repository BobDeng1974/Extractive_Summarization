by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:01 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 11 july 2013 the taxpayer has picked up the bill for private contractors to spend hours trying to persuade ducks to leave the @entity7 , it emerged today			1
the extraordinary farce of how @entity11 ’s £ 1billion @entity10 deal to refurbish the ministry reveals how the firm which now owns the building is crippled by bureaucracy while trying to rid a fountain of their feathered friends			1
a logbook of 24 hours in the bizarre world of @entity21 includes conflicting advice about whether an order can be given to scare the ducks and who is responsible for removing bird 's mess			1
duck bill : the taxpayer is paying for the private finance contractor who spent 24 hours trying to remove two birds from the @entity7 @entity33 : the £ 1billion @entity10 deal signed by @entity11 put the @entity7 building in the hands of a contractor chancellor @entity38 revealed the absurd contract signed by the @entity11 government was still tying the @entity7 up in knots			1
‘ it all started eight years ago when two ducks landed in the fountain , do what ducks and there was suddenly nine ducklings , ’ the chancellor said			1
at the time a whole team of @entity10 contractors , civil servants and the @entity51 were called to remove the ducks from the @entity7 ’s ‘ rather expensive water feature ’ and take them to @entity54			2
in june last year the ducks returned , sending the @entity56 into meltdown			2
to much laughter , mr @entity38 proceeded to read the detail of the logbook to a press gallery lunch for journalists in @entity63			1
the logbook details the extraordinary level of detail and effort the @entity7 staff went to , before discovering that the ducks had removed themselves more successfully than any contractor could manage			2
dismay : chancellor @entity38 told journalists : ' that ladies and gentlemen is how your money is spent ' @entity76 : the @entity7 's ' rather expensive water feature ¿ has been plagued by ducks for up to eight years the @entity80 help desk logbook for incident number 177853 on 20 june 2012 reveals that at 9.02am the initial request was created : ‘ @entity83 in the courtyard garden			1
request presence of an operative			0
’ by 9.22am an ‘ operative was attending incident ’			0
at 10.11am the contractor reported : ‘ i attended area and confirmed this is a male and female duck			0
issue has been discussed previously with @entity104 , they wo n’t attend the building for ducks , and i called @entity92 but they also wo n’t come remove ducks as it may cause injury to the duck and people in this area			1
‘ they have advised us to put signs requesting that people do not feed the ducks , and also to frighten them frequently so they do n’t feel comfortable here , they should then leave of their own accord			1
advised seniors of the above			0
’ the problem then seemed solved , but by 10.40am there was a u-turn			0
‘ please ignore previous , ’ the logbook stated			0
nest : eight years ago two birds arrived in the @entity7 , and before long nine ducklings had appeared ‘ have been advised that signs should not be put up yet without permission , and that the birds should not be frightened – we are responsible for guano only , not removing the birds			1
’ several hours later the situation escalated , with a plan to remove the ducks altogether			1
‘ have been advised that previous instances required the ducks to be caught and removed as there is insufficient space in the courtyard for ducks to take off , ’ the contractor wrote at 1.10pm			0
‘ message left for operative to contact the @entity56			0
’ the drama rolled into the next day , when an update was posted at 9am			0
‘ no ducks in the pond and disturbed all the bushed			0
seems they have left on their own			0
’ to huge laughter , mr @entity38 told journalists : ‘ that ladies and gentlemen is how your money is spent			1
’ soon after the coalition was formed in 2010 , the chancellor revealed that the @entity10 deal meant that a christmas tree for the @entity7 had cost £ 800			1
@entity10 schemes allow governments to put off raising upfront money for new buildings			0
instead , a private company is given a lengthy contract to build a school or hospital and then provides related ‘ services ’ to the public sector			2
the government leases the building for the length of the contract before it reverts to public ownership			2
earlier this year it emerged the contractor which owns the treasury building had rented it out for a scene in @entity175			2
cinemagoers did not realise that the supercars and scantily - clad partygoers in @entity175 were partying at the heart of the @entity7 the owner of the building hired it out to producers as a location for the @entity186 blockbuster , featuring fast cars and dancing girls the circular court of the treasury building was transformed into an underground nightclub in the latest movie in the series starring @entity194			2
producers used it as a dramatic location for the @entity186 blockbuster , featuring fast cars and dancing girls			0
official figures show that 544 @entity10 projects such as new school and hospital buildings were launched since 1997			0
the original capital cost of the projects agreed under the @entity11 government was £ 51.5billion			1
but repayments for these will have rocketed to an eye - watering total of £ 245billion by 2047/8 , according to the @entity7 .			0

health and *safety* rules leave private firm in charge of building *floundering*
taxpayer picks up the tab for 24 hours spent attempting to scare birds off
chancellor @entity38 said it was a *reminder* of @entity11 waste
