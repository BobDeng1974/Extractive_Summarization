by @entity0 the @entity2 bakery world famous for its cronut pastry that was knocked out of business temporarily last week after a health inspection found mouse droppings reopened tuesday at 8a with a long line of customers waiting outside			1
but the @entity9 on @entity10 is fighting hard to restore its reputation — and what it considers unfair criticism due to its success — by introducing a ' @entity16 ' cronut			1
a photo posted on @entity18 shows the donut inspired by the famous series of movies about boxer @entity22 , who was played by @entity23			0
it shows a cronut with dark chocolate frosting on top and a yellow golden star			1
the @entity29 in @entity30 reopened tuesday and to honor its comeback made a special ' @entity16 ' cronut just for the occasion the cronut , which was only available today to mark the reopening , was made ' as a symbol of our dedication and resilience , ' according to a bakery news release			1
the photo also shows a card net to the cronuts with a famous series of lines from the 2006 movie @entity22 , the sixth movie in the ' @entity16 ' franchise and said by the title character			0
@entity22 , played by @entity23 , in a scene from one of the ' @entity16 ' franchise movies			0
' let me tell you something you already know : the world ai n't all sunshine and rainbows ...			1
you , me , or nobody is gon na hit as hard as life			0
but it ai n't about how hard you hit			1
it 's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward ; how much you can take and keep moving forward , ' the card reads in part			2
@entity29 also said it has taken steps to make sure the ' severe mouse infestation ' found last week by the @entity2 @entity67 will not happen again			1
' we are deeply sorry for any disappointment that we may have caused you , ' the bakery said in a statement , according to @entity73			2
' taking this opportunity , we have completely fortified our facilities with a full reconstruction and re-cementing , taking every issue seriously in an effort to provide an even more pristine environment for our guests			0
as you know , we cook in completely opened kitchens , so everything we do is in full view			0
' however , the bakery also said it was facing ' malicious attacks ' due to its success			1
' looking forward , our hope is that honest , hard - working businesses should not have to face cruel and sensationalized attacks that are not framed in the proper context , ' the statement continued			1
' and systems should not be abused to single - out any one business over another			2
we urge our customers to seek deeper details and answers before jumping to conclusions			0
' and regardless of the hits , we will take every chance and criticism as a lesson learned and work harder to rise to the expectations you have of us and that we have of ourselves			0
' a mouse is seen scurrying on the floor of the @entity29 in a @entity110 video posted last week @entity112 cravers gathered around @entity113 , only to find out they had been shut down by the health department when the bakery opened at 8a this morning , there was already a huge line of customers , apparently unfazed by the @entity120 inspection			1
' the mice do n’t really cause me concern , ' @entity124 , 41 , who began waiting outside the bakery at 6a told the @entity125			2
' if you ’re in @entity2 , it ’s hard to avoid a mouse popping up now and then			2
if you ca n’t handle some mice , your metabolism is not ready for the big city			0
' ' the mice run this city , ' @entity135 , 26 , also told the paper			0
' the only places that say they do n’t have them are just the ones where the inspectors have n’t seen them yet			0
' the health department responded to @entity29 after a customer posted a video online april 3 showing a mouse scampering around the bakery floor			1
@entity112 fans queue for hours to buy the pastry that is half croissant and half donut @entity110 user @entity152 shot the video at @entity29 , telling @entity73 : ' i pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me			1
they did n't believe it until i showed them the video			1
then they had to leave			0
' i did n't mention it to employees			2
it appeared they were all aware of it			0
' this was the tail end of the little guy 's adventure			2
he ran all over the place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before i got my phone out , ' mr @entity152 said			0
after the video was posted online , workers at the bakery spent seven hours in a deep clean and a spokesman told @entity178 that not a single mouse was found			1
but a health department spokesman had a very different story tell after shutting the establishment down for a ' severe ' pest infestation			0
' what made the infestation severe was that the health inspector found several hundred mouse droppings , ' a @entity120 spokesman told @entity73 .			2

@entity29 created ' @entity191 ' as a symbol of our dedication and *resilence* '
bakery in @entity30 's @entity199 *neighborhood* was shut down last week after video surfaced of a mouse scurrying on the floor
