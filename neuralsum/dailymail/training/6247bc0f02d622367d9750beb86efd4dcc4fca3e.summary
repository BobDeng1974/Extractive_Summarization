' his obesity made him the man he is and that turned him into the person i love			2
' an equally smitten mr @entity11 , a former postman , says he can not wait to spend the rest of his life with @entity49 , despite the pair never having met in real life ' i ca n't think about anyone else and nor can she , ' he said			1
smitten : as @entity7 , from @entity55 , near @entity56 and @entity11 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , live 3,400 miles apart , the couple have to talk on @entity57 until @entity29 can come to the @entity23 new love : @entity11 , pictured at his heaviest , shed 48 stone after a gastric bypass surgery in 2010 the pair met online last month when @entity29 , of @entity55 , near @entity56 , @entity2 , saw a television documentary about mr @entity11 's extreme obesity - the result , he says , of overeating when a previous relationship ended			1

mr @entity11 said : ' i was a bit cautious to start with but as soon as i met her on @entity57 i felt at ease			2
we talked for four - and - a - half hours			0
' i did n't know anything about her but we talked all about her life and how she wants to help me			0
' ' it was n't until the second conversation that i realised there was more there than just friends			0
she felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend			0
' mr @entity11 says that he does n't go for looks and finds miss @entity49 's determined attitude particularly attractive			1
he said : ' i am more interested in the person rather than the physical side of things			0

' it is her personality , her drive and passion and she has a lovely smile that made me fall for her			0
like me she is a very determined person , i really adore that quality in her			0
' i 'm more determined than ever to get this operation and enjoy my life with her ' new life : mr @entity11 first met miss mountain when she got in touch to help him in his quest to have a second operation to remove layers of excess skin love letters : a hand crafted that @entity11 has made to send to @entity7 mr @entity11 ballooned to 70 stone after losing his father in his 20s triggered a compulsive eating disorder			1
