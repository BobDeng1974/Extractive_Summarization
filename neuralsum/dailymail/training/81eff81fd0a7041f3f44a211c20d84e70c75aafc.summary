by @entity0 last updated at 2:29 am on 6th january 2012 transgendered men have been in a limbo of sorts for years , identifying with males and looking like them , but having the sexual organs of - and needing treatment for - the female reproductive system			1
because of these dilemmas , many female - to - male transgender have postponed going to the doctor to avoid being the subject of belittling , unprofessional conduct from both doctors and nurses , and in two per cent of cases , violence and physical harassment from staff			1
but a board focusing on female health is hoping to change all that by advising @entity22 across the country to create a more accepting environment for the community			1
common bond : both @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) are members of the transgender community			1
some are afraid to go to a doctor for fear of discrimination or ridicule the @entity36 has reported at the case of transgender couple @entity38 , who was born as a female but lives as a male , and his partner @entity28 , a transgendered woman			1
mr @entity38 told the paper that he always felt a sense of dread when going to the gynaecologist , he still has a woman ’s sexual organs , which brings a slew of uncomfortable emotions from many doctors			1
‘ the ignorance runs its course , ’ he said			2
‘ a lot of us have avoided these types of experiences			2
’ mr @entity38 has avoided them by not going to a gynaecologist in more than a decade			2
his partner , 44 - year - old @entity60 , too , has been on the receiving end of discrimination			2
she has gotten her estrogen injections from a general practitioner rather than a gynaecologist			2
daddy dearest : @entity67 , a transgender man with a woman 's reproductive organs , was refused treatment from no less than eight doctors she told the paper she wanted to complete her transformation to a woman by getting gender reassignment surgery			1
she ’s put it off in part because of the cost , but said she ’s also afraid of being discriminated against			2
according to the @entity36 , nearly 30 per cent of the transgender community delays treatment because they fear discrimination			1
the community makes up around three per cent of the @entity85 population – around 9million @entity85			1
' by increasing the number of @entity22 providing care to transgender patients , we can help improve the overall health of the transgender community			1
' - dr @entity92 seeing the obvious dangers in patient ’s health , the @entity93 has been making strides to improve access to health care			1
the @entity100 on @entity101 for @entity102 helped develop new curriculum for what they call ‘ a small though substantial population			2
’ they recognise the word transgender is an umbrella term ‘ that includes people whose gender identity and / or gender expression differs from their assigned sex at birth			1
winds of change : dr @entity92 says it 's time for the transgender community to feel comfortable going to the doctor ‘ female - to - male , male - to - female , cross-dresses , bi-gendered , and intersex are the major groups that fall under the term transgender , ’ the report said			1
the goal is to increase available care to transgendered people			0
dr @entity92 , a former member of the committee , said : ‘ it would be wonderful if all transgender patients had the resources to be seen in a specialised clinic , but the reality is that many forgo care because they do n’t			2
she continued : ‘ by increasing the number of @entity22 providing care to transgender patients , we can help improve the overall health of the transgender community			1
’ in many cases , she said , men may need breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings if they take estrogen or had sexual reassignment surgery			0
transgender friendly : dr @entity92 suggests one way to help transgender patients feel more at ease is to create more unisex waiting rooms for female - to - male patients who have n’t had surgery , reproductive organ screenings of their breasts , ovaries , and uterus are required			1
dr @entity92 said that all transgender individuals should have access to @entity162 screenings , pap smears , and other routine procedures as well			2
‘ we need to make our offices settings that treat all patients with respect , ’ dr @entity92 said			0
‘ we want the transgender community to know that we , as @entity22 / @entity22 , care about their health			1
’ some offices are making their waiting rooms more transgender friendly and adding inclusive questions to medical histories			1
even so , board - certified methods for treating transgender patients are still a little - explored area			2
in 2008 , the ' pregnant man ' @entity67 case caused shouts and murmurs across the country			0
a pregnant mr @entity67 told @entity184 : ‘ i actually opted not to do anything to my reproductive organs because i wanted to have a child one day			0
i see pregnancy as a process and it does n’t define who i am			0
’ he called the desire to have a child as ‘ a human need , ’ not an intrinsically male or female function			0
he and his wife searched far and wide for a doctor who would help mr @entity67 through his pregnancy			0
they were turned away by eight different doctors before finding one who would take their case			0
dr @entity202 told @entity184 in 2008 that the baby was healthy , despite the unique fact that mr @entity67 had been taking testosterone supplements for years			0
a family affair : @entity27 ( right ) said his mother @entity207 finally accepted that he was a man she said : ‘ this is what i consider a normal pregnancy			0
’ a genetic woman who identifies as a man usually receives methyltestosterone injections every two weeks to suppress menses and bring on male secondary sex characteristics , like facial hair and a deeper voice , according to @entity93			1
doctors urge these patients still be screened for breast and cervical cancer unless they have been removed			0
in male - to - female cases , patients receive oestrogen therapy , and as a result , they lose body hair , redistribute body fat , and reduced testicular volume			0
the patient should be screened for both breast and prostate cancers			0
@entity22 / gyns are urged to provide comprehensive medical care to transsexual patients as well			1
one celebrity who has publicly undergone gender reassignment is @entity27 , who started his transformation in 2009			0
while he was public about having his breasts removed , he told @entity239 last may he would n’t divulge whether or not he had ‘ bottom surgery , ’ and adding ‘ i like to keep my privates private			0
’ but the 42 - year - old son of @entity207 and @entity243 said in the upcoming january 19 issue of @entity245 that he ’s ' saving up to buy a penis ' , making him one of the many men who would need to visit a gynecologist			0
he says he ’s leaning towards a metoidioplasty – a procedure that enhances the clitoris to make it function more like a penis			0
he says the procedure is ‘ like a car ' as there are many makes and models			0
another reason to look into it ? ‘ it ’s not that big a deal to sit down , but some of the toilet seats in men ’s rooms are disgusting			0
