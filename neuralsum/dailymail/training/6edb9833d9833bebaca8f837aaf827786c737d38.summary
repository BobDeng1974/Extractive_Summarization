by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 15:55 est , 29 august 2013 @entity2 's family has hit out at the producers of a new @entity5 film for allegedly portraying the former president as a racist			1
the @entity9 icon is played by @entity11 actor @entity10 in @entity12 , which tells the story of a black man who served in the @entity15 for 34 years			1
however , his son claims that the portrayal implies that @entity2 was prejudiced against black people , when in fact he helped the cause of african - americans and showed friendship to the real @entity15 butler			1
it is based on the real - life story of @entity31 , who died in 2010 and served every president from @entity44 to @entity2			2
mr @entity10 , known for his roles in @entity46 and the @entity47 , plays @entity2 , while anti-war activist @entity26 was controversially cast as his wife @entity27			2
in the film - as in real life - @entity2 invites the butler to attend a state dinner as a guest instead of an employee			2
but @entity36 is uncomfortable with the experience , and turns against the president over @entity2 's move to lift sanctions against @entity59 over the apartheid regime			1
@entity61 : the @entity62 , starring @entity37 and @entity63 , covers decades of @entity35 history the president 's son @entity33 has launched a blistering attack on his father 's portrayal , writing in @entity70 that the film should be called ' the @entity62 from @entity72 ' because it is so historically inaccurate			1
' portraying @entity2 as a racist because he was in favor of lifting economic sanctions against @entity59 is simplistic and dishonest , ' he wrote			2
' if you knew my father , you 'd know he was the last person on @entity79 you would call a racist			0
' he pointed out that the leader had a record of friendship towards black people , having been close to a number of african - americans during his college days			0
when @entity2 was governor of @entity90 , his son wrote , he more than doubled the number of black officials who had ever been appointed in the state 's history			1
attack : @entity96 , pictured speaking at his father 's funeral , is furious about the president 's portrayal @entity96 claimed that his parents ' treated mr @entity31 with the utmost respect ' - unlike in the film , where @entity36 's invitation to the state dinner is implied to have been an act of tokenism			1
when @entity31 was interviewed about his experiences in 2008 , his only reminiscence of the evening was to smile as his wife recalled , ' had champagne that night			0
' the film culminated with the butler 's resignation as a protest over @entity2 's opposition to @entity59 sanctions , though there is no evidence that this was the reason for @entity31 's retirement at the age of 67			1
' the real story of the @entity15 butler does nâ€™t imply racism at all , ' @entity96 wrote			0
' it 's simply @entity5 liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there			0
' he added : ' my father 's position on lifting the @entity59 sanctions in the 80s had nothing to do with the narrow issue of race			0
it had to do with the geopolitics of the @entity143			0
' @entity31 told his interviewer in 2008 that he was ' especially fond of the @entity145 ' , and resolutely refused to criticise any of the presidents he worked for			0
the @entity62 , directed by @entity147 , takes a number of liberties in adapting @entity31 's life story , most notably in inventing an episode in which his mother is raped and father killed by a plantation boss .			0

@entity2 is played by @entity10 in new film @entity12
he is shown opposing apartheid sanctions and *patronising* black employee
president 's son @entity33 says film implies he was racist and *insists* that this is completely *untrue*
