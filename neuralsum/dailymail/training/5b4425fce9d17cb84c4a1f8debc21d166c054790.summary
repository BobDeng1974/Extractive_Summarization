@entity0 have broken promises they made to @entity2 when persuading him to join the club , a soon - to - be - released biography of the @entity6 coach claims			1
written by @entity6 journalist @entity8 , it has emerged that one of @entity2 's conditions for joining @entity0 was that @entity11 would not be sold ' under any circumstances '			1
@entity11 was sold to @entity13 for £ 20million this summer			1
@entity8 's book @entity15 has been written on the back of several months which the journalist spent shadowing @entity2 in @entity17			2
it will be released in @entity19 at the end of this month			0
having been approached , and offered huge sums , by both @entity30 and @entity31 , @entity2 is said to have been promised that all financial conditions would be met without problems by then @entity0 president @entity34			2
with @entity0 carrying no debt , and able to appeal to their various corporate shareholders for particular investments , @entity2 's salary , estimated to be around £ 12m a year , was not central to discussions			1
rather , it was footballing issues which the @entity42 was keen to clear before taking the job			0
split : @entity2 and @entity11 exchange words on the touchline at @entity47 last season pass master : @entity11 is now playing his trade in @entity13 's midfield after a £ 20m summer transfer some have been well documented			1
@entity2 's desire to sign @entity55 from @entity25 was clear from the beginning , as was his ultimatum to the @entity0 board with regard to @entity60			1
' @entity60 or nothing ' , he is alleged to have said			0
@entity8 's book , though , alleges that @entity2 also specified that @entity11 should not be sold under any circumstances			1
the former @entity65 boss saw pass - master @entity11 as a key ingredient to the project he wished to build in @entity68			0
in @entity2 's first season , @entity11 was used only as part of a rotation policy with the likes of @entity60			1
this disgruntled the midfielder , and led to a famous touchline spat last winter			0
the player eventually demanded a far higher wage from @entity0 , claiming he felt undervalued			0
injury headache : @entity2 will be without midfielder @entity60 ( centre ) for a lengthy period that led to a whole six months of endless speculation as to whether @entity11 would leave for the @entity82 or @entity83 , or if @entity0 would cave to his demands			1
during negotiations with the midfielder , the narrative became clear that both @entity2 and director of sport @entity89 were desperate to keep the player , while the board were happy to let him go			0
' @entity11 is a great guy , he loves the game			0
i would really like to hold onto him , ' @entity2 said in april			0
but with the board , led by @entity97 , refusing point blank to raise @entity11 ' wages , the player was lost to @entity13 after the @entity100			2
after his move , @entity11 insisted that he had ' no problem whatsoever with @entity2 '			2
many had already seen the @entity11 saga as a clear case of @entity2 being undermined by the board			2
with @entity8 's claim that @entity2 had demanded the player stay from the very beginning , that reading seems even more valid			0
it remains to be seen how much @entity0 will miss @entity11 , but with both @entity60 and @entity111 set to miss a huge chunk of the early season through injury , his departure may prove to be a crucial development in @entity2 's second season in @entity17			1
@entity0 team is n't fully fit yet - @entity2			0

@entity119 midfielder @entity11 joined @entity13 this summer
@entity11 was sold after contract *dispute* with @entity0
new biography on @entity2 claims he was made promise by @entity0 that @entity11 would never be sold
@entity11 sale was authorised by @entity127 against @entity2 's wishes , claims book
@entity2 is now *facing* headache in central midfield after injuries to @entity60 and @entity111
