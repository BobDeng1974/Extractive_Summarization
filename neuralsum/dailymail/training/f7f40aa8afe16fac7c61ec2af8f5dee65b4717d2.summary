‘ it ’s a shame that there was no @entity70 back in the @entity114 , as we ’re confident we could have saved @entity5 a lot of time and heartache by helping him find long - lasting love with a truly compatible partner who shared his beliefs and outlook on life			2
’ @entity123 and @entity3 graduate @entity11 added : ‘ the results of the study have been fascinating			2
