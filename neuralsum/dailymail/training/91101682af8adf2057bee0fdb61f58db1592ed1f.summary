here 's the dream for those college years : a beer pong partner that never gets drunk			1
researchers in @entity4 have developed a robotic arm that can shoot balls across a beer pong table — and score nearly every time			1
want to challenge the @entity9 ? the invention , built by @entity13 startup @entity11 , will make its debut appearance at the 2015 @entity15 in @entity16 this january			1
to make the shots , scientists calibrate the arm by aiming at the cup in the center - back row			2
researchers then shoot about 10 times to make sure the robot got it — and from there , the computer takes over and calculates the location for the rest of the cups engineers hope the @entity9 could be outfitted to to grab and relocate items in manufacturing ' if you watch the video , you will see that the robot does not shoot from the same position each time , ' @entity24 told @entity30			1
' it moves according to which cup it 's aiming at			0
' despite its fun use , the @entity9 has serious applications			2
experts at @entity11 hope the technology will be applied to manufacturing and packaging tasks , where a similar arm can grab and drop pills , bricks , light bulbs and other materials			0
' what we use it for is generally industrial automation , ' @entity24 told @entity30			0
' you 'd see it in automotive factories , consumer electronics factories , and small mom - and - pop shops that are making little gizmos and gadgets			0
' although this technology — which uses components called ' granular materials ' — has been around since the 1970s , it has only recently been used in a practical way , according to @entity30			0
engineer @entity83 , who co-founded @entity11 , first created a robot that throws darts and ping - pong balls while working on his phd at @entity88			1

the @entity9 , built by @entity13 startup @entity11 , can aim and shoot ping - pong balls across a table with **excellent** *precision*
engineers say the machine is *n't* perfect , but it 's good enough that only **excellent** players can beat it
want to challenge the robot ? *versaball* will make its debut appearance at the 2015 @entity15 in @entity16 this january
