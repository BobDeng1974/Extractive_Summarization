by @entity0 @entity1 is used to being the rock at the heart of the @entity5 defence but now it seems he is showing his strength in a different way - by using his girlfriend as an impromptu set of weights			1
the 36 - year - old retired at the end of last season following a glorious 15 - year career with @entity5 , winning 21 trophies as well as captaining the @entity18 giants for 10 years			1
but now the former @entity20 defender has been keeping himself in shape by giving his girlfriend @entity22 a bit of a lift			0
and while his former @entity5 team - mates , including his mooted replacement @entity43 , are in @entity45 training at @entity46 , he was pictured lifting up his girlfriend up in the air - proving he has n't lost any of his famed strength			2
and maybe @entity1 has been inspired to take up a career in @entity50 ( although he almost certainly would n't be able to use his girlfriend as equipment ! )			0

@entity1 is ensuring he keeps fit in the *aftermath* of his retirement by bench - pressing his girlfriend @entity22
the 36 - year - old spent 15 years at @entity5 , winning 21 trophies
@entity1 captained the @entity18 club for a decade
@entity5 currently training at @entity46 in @entity62
