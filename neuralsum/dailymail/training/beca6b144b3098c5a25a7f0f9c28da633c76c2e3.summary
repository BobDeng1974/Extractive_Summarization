she suffered a massive heart attack and died of septicaemia at around 6.30am @entity4 morning			2
yesterday her parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , accused the @entity28 of ' gambling ' with their daughter 's life after a coroner said she should never have been sent home from hospital			1
mr @entity27 , 39 , a forklift truck driver , said : ' we certainly feel the doctors let her down , they could have done more			0
' we felt something was very wrong and kept expressing our concerns , but they did n't want to know			0
' i know that the @entity28 is pressed , i know that they can be understaffed but it 's not acceptable to say we ca n't have senior doctors examine patients			2
' i feel like they were taking a gamble sending us home and they should n't be able to take shortcuts or put lives at risk			2
' no - one wants to be in hospital on @entity4 but i would rather have waited another two hours and made sure @entity7 was seen by the right people			1
' we feel that something could have been done if they had been monitoring her			0
@entity26 and @entity58 said they were ' extremely reluctant ' to return home with their daughter on christmas eve last year ' the tragedy for us is that we will never know what would have happened if she had stayed in hospital and not been sent home			2
' mrs @entity7 , a support worker for adults with learning difficulties , added : ' the whole family has been absolutely devastated by @entity7 's death			1
' we believe she would be alive today if she had had better care			0
' @entity7 , described as a ' bright , loving and funny little girl , ' was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months			1
the relatively common condition meant she had two kidneys on her left side , but only one was working correctly , leaving her susceptible to regular urinary tract or water infections			2
the inquest , at @entity80 , was told that , despite her problems , @entity7 , of @entity81 , @entity82 , lived a ' pretty normal ' life			1
but on saturday december 22 last year the schoolgirl began complaining of stomach ache , nausea and a headache			0
when she had n't improved by @entity90 , her parents took her to the family gp , who confirmed she had a water infection and prescribed antibiotics			2
she was examined by a junior doctor at @entity96 but , despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet ¿ a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning ¿ @entity7 was discharged later that night , however , @entity7 's condition worsened and she began struggling to breathe			1
her parents noticed purple blotches or bruising to her feet and decided to take her to @entity96 , where she was seen by junior doctor @entity105 at around 12.30am			1
the medic , who qualified four years earlier , but had been working in paediatric @entity107 for just a month , said he ' did n't think ' to take the youngster 's blood pressure			2
the test , the court heard , may have shown @entity112 to have low blood pressure - a symptom often associated with blood poisoning			0
mr @entity27 added : ' i told him we 'd never seen her as poorly as this before , we were concerned that it was n't just a water infection			0
' the doctor went to speak to a senior paediatrician but when he came back said the best thing was to discharge her and see if there was improvement within 48 hours			0
' fighting back tears , he told the hearing : ' we knew something was n't right			0
i had never seen her like that			0
we left it to the professionals as we thought they knew best			0
' dr @entity135 , a more senior doctor at the hospital with 15 years ' experience , said she would most likely have admitted the youngster			0
@entity7 - pictured on her first birthday - described as a ' bright , loving and funny little girl , ' was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months ' it is very difficult to disagree with the father 's view that @entity7 should have been kept in for observation , ' she said			1
' we tell doctors to take parents ' concerns into consideration as they can be very astute			0
' the couple returned home ' extremely reluctantly ' at around 2.30am but at 6.30am @entity7 was still complaining of feeling cold , so mrs @entity7 went to run her a hot bath			1
as mr @entity27 picked up his daughter to take her to bathroom she suffered a massive heart attack and stopped breathing			0
@entity7 once said to her father that when she died she wanted to come back as a beautiful butterfly			1
coroner dr @entity159 refused an application by the hospital that @entity7 died of natural causes @entity7 pictured last year			1
her parents , who are taking legal action against the hospital , tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance , but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later the couple , who are taking legal action against the hospital , tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance , but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later			0
coroner dr @entity159 refused an application by the hospital that @entity7 died of natural causes			1
instead he delivered a narrative verdict , saying : ' it seems to me that if she had been seen by a more experienced doctor she would probably have been kept in for observation and … further deterioration would have become more apparent during the early hours of @entity4 morning and would have been acted on more quickly			1
' however , the coroner stressed it was impossible for him to say ' on the balance of probabilities ' whether she would have survived			0
the couple 's solicitor , @entity183 , of @entity186 - based @entity185 , said the @entity187 had ' lost everything they lived for			0
' ' we are very concerned about the care provided to @entity7 as some quite basic checks were not done , ' mrs @entity183 said			2
