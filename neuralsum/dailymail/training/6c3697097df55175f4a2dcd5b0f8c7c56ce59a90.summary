a woman angry at cuts being made to council services has decided to take matters into her own hands , by employing a handywoman to do jobs in the area			1
former @entity9 contestant @entity8 , 41 , has employed @entity10 , 40 , on a £ 16,000 salary to do ' absolutely anything that needs doing in the community ' after council cuts hit local services in @entity16 in @entity17			1
mrs @entity8 pays the wages herself			1
ms honey , a former carer , also has her own motorised buggy provided by mrs @entity8 , and carries out any jobs local residents need including clearing rubbish , cutting hedges and going on patrol to find where street lights need replacing and the elderly need help			1
@entity29 ( centre ) has employed @entity10 ( left ) on a £ 16,000 salary as a handywoman for @entity16 in @entity17 , after she felt council cuts were hitting services in the community			1
ms @entity19 clears rubbish and trims hedges and the pair have put up ' welcome ' signs to show people they care about the village the scheme has been so successful ms honey has won the backing of @entity44 for her help to clear up the local community and make people feel safe and proud of their area			1
mrs @entity8 , a businesswoman who runs a car leasing firm , decided to place an advert for a handyman or woman to help clear up the community after she fell victim to a string of thefts and was told there were few resources to sort out the village			1
she said : ' back in september last year we had a break in with someone trying to steal our @entity62			0
we challenged him and he picked up this @entity65 knife			0
after the event i threw my toys out of the pram			0
we had already had bikes stolen			0
i just said we have to do something about this village			0
' i had a meeting with the police and council but i was told there was not enough funds to clean up the village with police saying they only had a certain level of man power			2
it maybe the nature of the times and everybody is cutting back and yet money is wasted money relentlessly on things			0
' mrs @entity8 decided to find her own solution to the problem and employed ms honey instead , equipping her with her own uniform and tools as well as a @entity93 - emblazoned with signs that say : ' stop me , ask me for free help			1
' as part of her role ms honey carries out daily patrols , clearing rubbish and notifying police of any break - ins			2
she even fixes light bulbs in people 's houses and sits with the elderly			0
she has been ordered by mrs @entity8 to ignore councillors who claim she needs an environmental licence to pick up rubbish			1
as part of her role ms honey collects rubbish and clears the local area of discarded litter ( right ) ms @entity19 has been equipped with clothing and a motorised ' help ' truck by mrs @entity8 for her work she added : ' @entity10 does anything that needs doing in the locality - but obviously within reason			1
she picks litter , washes the bus stops and telephone boxes , picks up dog mess and helps anyone out			0
if an elderly person needs their ivy trimmed from the house - @entity10 will do it			2
even if they need the newspaper paper picked up from the newsagents she will do it			0
' following the @entity133 statement , @entity131 is expected to have to cut £ 16.2million from its budget in the next 12 months			2
it also recently came under fire for switching to fortnightly bin collections - which councillors claim has saved £ 5million			1
last year the council also announced proposals to consult over the closure of five of its remaining care homes - saving an estimated £ 4million			1
mrs @entity8 said she feels council cuts have led to local areas like @entity16 suffering and that resources are not always used in the best way			1
she said : ' they send out highly trained operative to specialised vehicles and protective clothing just to pick up a mattress lying around			0
how much does that cost ? my view was that if a job needed doing well , you do it yourself			0
' what @entity10 is doing is maintaining the village , doing what the council used to do			2
we used to have street sweepers on the streets permanently			0
but now i think the council will only come around once every three months or so with a team and they clean the streets			0
the trouble is the mess builds up in between			0
' mrs @entity8 is pictured with the @entity171 truck she bought and @entity173 's @entity172 , who has backed the project and said keeping the community clean and safe is a way of showing people they care mrs @entity8 has paid for signs to be put up throughout the village , welcoming people and making them aware who their @entity181 is - winning the backing of police			1
@entity173 's chief constable @entity172 , told the @entity185 : ' this embodies what is really special about @entity16 , where a community is taking the initiative and exhibiting what a great little village it is			1
' crime happens but @entity17 is one of the safest places to live in the @entity195			0
it is great that @entity8 and @entity197 have led the way here if there is no litter , graffiti or dog poo in a community then people like living there as they can see that people care			2
' as part of her role ms honey notifies police where there have been break - ins or property damaged			0
as handywoman ms honey trims hedges ( left ) and washes and cleans signs ( right ) throughout the village ms @entity19 has been in the role since november and police said it has already been a success in @entity16 @entity16 pcso @entity223 said : ' @entity16 has had a reputation for a number of years as being something of a problem area			1
@entity10 has been in the role for a month or so and things seem to be going really well			0
' ms @entity8 became a well - known character after she appeared on @entity9 in 2007 and turned down an offer of £ 50,000 to invest in her business - lingscars			1
shortly after starting the job in november , ms @entity19 posted cards to all the houses of @entity16 notifying them of the new service provided by mrs @entity8			1
ms @entity19 added : ' we posted leaflets when we started in everyone 's doors			1
it was a bit weird at first as people would pass me and say ' morning @entity10 ' and i would think ' how do they know my name ? ' i really enjoy the job			0
@entity8 just lets me get on with it			0
' @entity8 previously appeared on @entity9 but turned down an offer of £ 50,000 investment ' it is a bizarre and unique job and when i saw it i realised it was the job for me - i do n't think anywhere else does it			2
' @entity254 , @entity131 's head of direct services , said : ' the council has not significantly reduced clean and green services in the @entity259 area or indeed anywhere else in the county			2
most of the savings we have made have involved improving the efficiency of the services we provide for example , by cutting down our number of depots and reorganising but not reducing working hours			0
' we do , however , welcome local communities doing what they can in partnership with the council to improve their local area			2
