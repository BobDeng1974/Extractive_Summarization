by @entity0 last updated at 11:57 am on 17th october 2011 mps will debate ' full disclosure ' of all documents relating to the @entity5 disaster in @entity6 today after 100,000 people signed online petition in support of the move			1
there has already been an inquest into the tragedy in which 96 @entity15 fans lost their lives on april 15 1989 as their team played @entity18 in an @entity20 semi-final			2
however , the families of the victims dispute the findings of the single inquest into all 96 deaths which ruled the victims had all sustained their fatal injuries by 3.15pm			1
the victims ' families believe the government files will shed new light on the catastrophe and @entity32 has given his backing to the process			1
mr @entity32 offered his support in a letter to @entity37 , who initiated the full disclosure process on the 20th anniversary of the disaster , ' justice for the 96 ' : @entity15 fans still display banners in reference to the @entity5 disaster , which will be debated in @entity6 tonight after 100,000 people signed an online petition in the letter , published by @entity48 , mr @entity32 wrote : ' the government is committed to full disclosure of the @entity5 information it holds			1
we have proposed that disclosure takes place to the families prior to wider publication			1
' in particular , they are keen to see the minutes of a cabinet briefing which they say took place the following day between the then - prime minster @entity63 and senior officers at @entity64			1
it was three days after the meeting that @entity68 newspaper published an infamous story , quoting an unnamed police source , which blamed the disaster on a group of drunken @entity15 fans			2
the article , which was subsequently heavily discredited by @entity76 's inquiry , also claimed some @entity15 fans had pickpocketed the dead and urinated on police as they tried to control the situation			2
@entity76 's report into the disaster in august of the same year said : ' not a single witness was called before the inquiry to support any of those allegations			1
' the anger it created in @entity15 led to a boycott of the paper in the city that remains in place today despite efforts to apologise			0
the chair of the @entity94 has today called on @entity68 to reveal the identity of the unnamed police source quoted in the story			0
tragedy : fans carry an injured supporter off the pitch during the disaster which claimed 96 lives @entity104 , who lost her 18 - year - old son @entity105 in the disaster told @entity107 : ' if we are now to discover the real truth , let the @entity68 tell us who gave them those lies which caused so much damage			0
' if the @entity68 wants to make amends , they should reveal who it was , not allow their sources to hide behind anonymous briefings 22 years later , and help the families to understand what happened			1
' the families believe a major incident plan was never initiated by @entity64 meaning crushed fans were denied emergency and potentially lifesaving medical attention			1
boycott : many @entity15 fans refuse to buy @entity68 newspaper after its reporting of the story the families also dispute the findings of the single inquest into all 96 deaths which ruled the victims had all sustained their fatal injuries by 3.15pm			1
this meant the coroner did not hear any evidence of what happened after that point - even though many bereaved families believe their loved ones could still have been alive			2
the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
the families say it is an injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully to account for the disaster			2
writing about the issue on his blog today , @entity107 's media commentator @entity151 said : ' the @entity155 force had a motive - to distract attention from its own failings , as highlighted by @entity76 - and the opportunity to brief journalists off the record			0
' however , he also points out that he does n't think the @entity68 revealing the name of the source would shed much new light on the subject			0
' it is possible that the release of internal police documents will point a finger towards an individual , though i somehow doubt it , ' he wrote			0
home secretary @entity172 is expected to restate the government 's position is a ' commitment to full transparency about the @entity5 disaster through full public disclosure '			0
however , there are some issues surrounding the legality of publishing the documents because standard practise maintains that those details are not usually published for 30 years			0
the documents set to be disclosed will include cabinet papers from the time , but it is as yet unclear if that tranche of information will include the meeting between @entity63 and @entity155 police			1
a panel of independent experts has been established to examine the documents , and will then report on what the new details add to the public understanding of the disaster			0
it is the second petition to be debated in the @entity199 since the coalition introduced the e-petition system			0
mps considered the riots last week , and are also set to discuss @entity206 membership of the @entity207 .			0

families of victims want to see cabinet minutes of briefing between @entity63 and @entity64
@entity32 writes letter to @entity37 *pledging* his support for the cause
