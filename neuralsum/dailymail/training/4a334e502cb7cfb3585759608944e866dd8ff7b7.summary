’ mrs @entity23 , a junior teacher , said she had arrived to work at @entity42 , in @entity43 , north east @entity44 , early to attend @entity45 last thursday			2

i was walking to the other side of the school with my teaching assistant when i felt something			0
‘ the children were about to come in and i said i did n’t want the kids seeing me like this because i did n’t want to frighten them so we went into a classroom that was not being used			0
’ teaching assistants ( from left ) @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 with their certificates for helping with the birth she said she sat at a computer desk on a computer chair as her contractions become stronger			1
