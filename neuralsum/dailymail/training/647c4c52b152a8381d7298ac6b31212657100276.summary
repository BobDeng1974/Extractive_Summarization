by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 hardly needs any extra incentive when he steps out at the @entity4 , but he got it anyway on monday night when @entity6 champion @entity5 was humbled			1
the @entity7 was @entity2 ’s scheduled last - eight opponent until he fell to a dismal 6 - 4 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 defeat to @entity11 ’s @entity10 , opening up that whole quarter of the draw			1
nobody has done more this season to puncture the aura of the ‘ @entity17 ’ than @entity5 , who followed up his @entity20 triumph with victory at the @entity22 in april			1
in climbing to world no 3 he has amassed a 6 - 0 record against top - 10 players in 2014 , and that stands intact because @entity10 is ranked only 41st			2
@entity5 ’s error - strewn first - round performance as the light faded emphasised how consistent @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity2 have been in winning round after round in the @entity33 over the last 10 years			1
down and out : @entity5 never looked comfortable in heavy conditions in @entity35 over and out : @entity5 's defeat by @entity10 opened the draw up for @entity2 the pressure of turning up at a major with the expectations created by what he did in @entity43 appeared to have withered @entity5 , while the unseeded @entity44 showed how dangerous the rank - and - file can be			1
for @entity2 , tuesday afternoon will be the first time since 2011 that he goes into a @entity33 without @entity47 in his corner			1
a good run at @entity4 might yet persuade him to delay an appointment until after @entity51 , lest a change cause disruption at a crucial time			0
@entity43 @entity54 has ruled himself out of any permanent appointment and @entity57 @entity56 , another name associated with the post , also appears to be a non-runner			0
@entity2 can not be preoccupied by such things when he takes on @entity62 , one of several @entity63 who has defected to @entity64 due to the lure of extra financial support from the newly rich nation			1
the world no 53 is a fan of the @entity63 writer @entity70 , and has just finished reading @entity71			0
@entity72 : @entity11 's @entity10 celebrates his victory over the @entity6 champion commence : @entity2 will begin his @entity4 campaign against @entity62 on tuesday unfamiliar : @entity2 enters his first grand slam since 2011 without @entity47 as his coach @entity78 crumbles @entity80 's return to @entity4 25 years after he won the title as a 17 - year - old did not last long			1
@entity80 is coaching @entity83 no 9 seed @entity78 , who has been struggling with back problems and went out 7 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 to @entity86			2
congrats on the loss , @entity89 in @entity91 ’s press conference after his loss to @entity93 , an @entity94 reporter opened with ‘ congratulations ’			0
the @entity96 replied : ‘ are you serious , did you watch the match ? ’ — ‘ no , i was told that you won , i ’m sorry ’			0
reply : ‘ questions in @entity96 please			0
’ @entity102 effort @entity105 qualifier @entity103 defeated @entity96 @entity106 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 , 1 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 18 - 16			0
the 144 - minute deciding set took longer than the first four put together			0
@entity62 would like to inflict the latter on @entity2 , and the weapon he will employ is his forehand which , when it runs hot , is potent enough to cause anyone problems			1
‘ i have to play my tennis , ’ said @entity62 , whose parents are both doctors			2
‘ every match you can be different with the tactics , with the small things , but basically i will attack			0
i ’m not going to stay behind the baseline five metres just waiting for his mistakes			0
’ the glitz of the @entity33 will have seemed remote to @entity121 yesterday , and the closest he came to any glamour was having the brother of @entity126 defender @entity125 in his corner			2
@entity128 , who is friends with the @entity130 ’ wavering defender , exited amid the grey and the drizzle to the formidable @entity133			2
but @entity121 ’s creditable performance in going down 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 to the no 17 seed at least suggested that the annual charge of the @entity138 men on grass this summer — which begins next week at @entity140 — might not boil down purely to a 27 - year - old @entity141			1
after playing an excellent first set the @entity138 no 3 was slightly unfortunate to be forced off for rain , which did not just stop his momentum but made the clay slow and heavy , which better suited the rock - solid @entity44			2
‘ look , i ’m 27 ; i ’m not 32			0
people sometimes forget that , ’ he said of his top - 100 prospects			0
‘ i ’ve had injuries in the past when i ’ve had chances , but it ’s not an excuse			0
you got to take time and work your way up			0
’ brave : @entity121 took the first set before being beaten by no 17 seed @entity133 steady : the @entity44 showed his class to pull away from @entity121 and claim his place in the second round qualifier @entity167 opens on tuesday morning against @entity169 , the world no 63 from the @entity171 , against whom she will try and continue her eight - match winning streak			1
the @entity171 is best known for being banned last year after testing positive for the banned substance sibutramine , which she claimed to have ingested accidentally through a weight - loss supplement			0
@entity167 has an even chance of progress			2
whatever she does , it is unlikely to be as trying a day as it will be for @entity180 , who makes her first public appearance since @entity182 broke off their engagement			1
she plays @entity185 of @entity186 this afternoon and will find it hard to match the rebounding that her ex-fiancee managed on the golf course on sunday			0
bow : @entity138 's @entity167 will take on @entity169 on tuesday test : @entity180 will play her first game since splitting from @entity182 one thing you can count on is that her post-match press conference will draw one of the bigger crowds of the day			1
but he was in trouble virtually from the start on @entity201 and became the first @entity6 champion to lose in the first round in @entity35 since @entity204 in 1998			1
@entity5 , who has struggled at times with his new status as a major favourite , made the quarter - finals in @entity35 last year for the first time having reached the fourth round in the previous three years .			1

@entity5 beaten by @entity10 in first round
@entity6 champion 's defeat opens up draw for @entity2
