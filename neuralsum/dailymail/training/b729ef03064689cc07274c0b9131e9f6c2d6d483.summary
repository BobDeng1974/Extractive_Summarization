brutal : a youngster said to have been killed fighting on the frontline for the terror group @entity5 's son had been missing for a week , seized by @entity7 gunmen along with 148 other schoolchildren , when a friend discovered the fanatics had posted a contact number for distraught parents on the internet			1
he called the number and a militant put the terrified 13 - year - old on the line			2
‘ he was really scared and crying so much , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ i tried to calm him down and say it would be all right , but then i started crying too			2
i could n’t help it			2
’ seconds later , a jihadi leader took the phone and told the @entity25 car dealer that the seized pupils would only be let go if a group of captured is fighters was freed			1
@entity5 pleaded they were poor people without influence , begging him to spare their sons			0
‘ if they are not released within one week we will start killing your children , one by one , ’ replied the callous terrorist leader			1
the teenage boys were not killed , however			1
instead they were brainwashed , forced to watch horrific videos of beheadings and torture , then viciously beaten with cables if they failed to memorise @entity43 verses or even if they drank water without permission			0
their captors included many foreign extremists – among them a white @entity50 doctor in his late 30s who treated the boys after the most savage beatings			1
many of the boys were finally freed last week after almost five months in captivity			1
but delight turned to dismay for their families when the boys started telling their fathers they would soon be slaughtered by jihadis and ordered ‘ indecent ’ mothers and sisters to cover their faces			1
‘ it was like they had been infected with a mental disease , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ they were praying all the time , not talking to us and behaving so strangely			0
’ the saga of the 149 seized pupils , subjected to intensive mind control to convert them into militants , gives chilling new insight into the cruelties of the terror group that has seized large chunks of @entity80 and @entity81			1
staking their claim : the sinister black flag of the @entity7 flies over the town of @entity86 , @entity81 the children were from @entity86 , the key @entity81 border town being besieged by @entity89			1
their astonishing story emerged as i spoke to some of the @entity93 forced to flee their homes in the region			0
i stood by these refugees as they cheered from over the @entity98 border while watching bombs dropped by @entity101 - led coalition aircraft flatten buildings flying the black flag of the jihadis			2
the thump of mortar shells and sounds of gunfire were clearly audible from street fighting in the town lying just across fields , as @entity89 launched a fresh assault on the key @entity25 stronghold yesterday			1
cars abandoned by fleeing families could be seen parked in panic on the border , while there are fears hundreds of trapped civilians face massacre			2
local and international fury is growing over the inaction of @entity98 , a @entity124 ally seeking to join the @entity125			0
some 16 tanks and armoured personnel carriers were on a hill nearby me ; several had guns trained on their own towns , not @entity81			1
@entity98 led calls for action against @entity81 president @entity134 – but its rulers fear @entity25 separatists more than the @entity138 fanatics of @entity89			1
the country , home to 15 million @entity25 , fought a secessionist insurgency for three decades until a ceasefire two years ago			0
@entity25 leaders accuse @entity98 of supplying jihadis with weapons			0
‘ we have hundreds of youngsters who want to go and fight these people but @entity98 will not let them cross the border , ’ said @entity146 , a political activist from @entity86			1
more stories of murder and mayhem emerged yesterday			0
one man told me how is thugs beheaded a well - known character with learning difficulties called @entity159 , then drove around the streets dragging his body behind a car			0
‘ they do things like this to scare the population , ’ said @entity163 , a mechanic who witnessed the atrocity before escaping @entity86 last week			1
even amid such horrors , the brainwashing of schoolboys marks a terrible new twist in @entity81 ’s nightmare			1
the story was confirmed by six families , most of whom asked not to be named for fear of reprisals			0
the children were captured at a checkpoint on may 29 , as they were happily returning home in buses after 17 days of exams in @entity185			1
masked gunmen separated boys from girls , then took 149 @entity25 teenagers to a mosque in @entity191 , an hour ’s drive from @entity86			1
‘ they were very scary , ’ said one 13 - year - old			0
‘ there were many foreigners among them			0
’ the frightened boys were groomed with hours of lectures in radical @entity198			1
they were told women should be covered up , that alcohol and music were forbidden , that earthly life was meaningless and killing disbelievers was the surest path to paradise			0
‘ they instructed us that jihad was an obligation and we would all be bought to justice before @entity210 on the day of judgment , ’ said one 15 - year - old			0
every couple of days the boys were shown videos which became steadily more barbaric , with footage of beheadings , suicide operations and slaughtering of enemies			2
chilling : the children were from @entity86 , the key @entity81 border town being besieged by @entity89 , pictured above brainwashed : the frightened boys were told women should be covered up , that alcohol and music were forbidden and that killing disbelievers was the surest path to paradise			1
above , @entity228 militants in @entity81 ‘ they played emotional games to brainwash our boys to their cause , putting such heavy pressure on them , ’ said one father , a market trader			1
‘ i have no doubt they wanted them to join their jihad			0
’ slowly but surely , this intense indoctrination began to influence the boys			2
‘ i did not believe in it , ’ a farmer ’s son told me			0
‘ but after watching these videos , some of my friends said that when they left the prison they would return to join @entity250 [ the arabic name for @entity89 ]			1
’ the slightest infraction led to vicious beatings with cables on the boys ’ backs or legs			2
one was left so badly wounded he could barely walk for ten days ; another group was singled out for specially brutal violence lasting hours after other boys informed on escape plans			1
these teenagers were treated afterwards by a brown - haired @entity264 identified as ‘ the @entity50 doctor ’ by other militants			0
there were also several other guards from @entity264			0
for the parents , the boys ’ release ended an awful ordeal			2
‘ i was so sad , so scared and lost all hope , ’ said @entity273 , 54 , whose 13 year - old son was badly beaten twice while held captive			0
but any joy was short - lived for many of the families , however , as they discovered how their lost children had been indoctrinated			2
‘ my son was praying all the time and talking about slaughtering people , which was very frightening , ’ said one middle - class father			0
‘ he kept asking why we were not praying and was saying @entity250 were coming to slaughter us			0
he was telling his mother and sisters to cover themselves up since they were indecent			0
’ after a week with his secular family , this studious 15 - year - old had returned to his old self and he looked embarrassed when we discussed his brief burst of zealotry			0
yet clearly some of the @entity25 teenagers remain militantly religious – with at least one intent on returning to join the fanatics			0
‘ some of these children still pray regularly and remain influenced by their experiences and the religious teaching , ’ a local teacher said			2
he speculated the aim was also to sow disunity among besieged @entity25 in @entity86			1
but for 29 of these families , the hell continues as their sons , seized five months ago by the world ’s most lethal terror group , remain captive .			1
