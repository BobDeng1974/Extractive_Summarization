muslim schools all over @entity2 are forcing female pupils as young as 11 to wear burkas , it emerged today			1
institutions say that they are ' strict ' on uniforms for their children because full - face veils are the ' desired dress code of a @entity11 female '			1
but campaigners believe it is ' wrong ' for any child to cover their face and the home secretary @entity16 says that all women should be able to ' make a choice ' about what they wear			1
some @entity21 schools in @entity2 force female pupils as young as 11 to wear full - face veils as part of their uniform it came as a judge ruled this week that a @entity11 will be allowed to stand trial with her face covered as long as it is removed while giving evidence			1
the case has prompted some mps to call for full - face veils to be banned but many @entity21 schools , which have control over uniform policy , insist their pupils wear burkas			1
the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , requires all its pupils wear a black burka and a long black coat outside			2
on its website , its describes its uniform policy as ' strict ' and as supporting the ' desired dress code of a @entity11 female '			1
it continues : ' the present uniform conforms to the @entity48 of dressing and must be adhered to at all times both within the school and dismissal at the end of the day			0
' the school does not allow any of its 300 pupils to wear any form of makeup or jewellery			2
the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , also insists pupils wear a navy blue burka or a jilbab , which does not cover the face			2
on its website , the school says its is ' not willing to compromise on any issues regarding uniform '			0
@entity37 , in @entity38 , @entity39 , insists all pupils wear a black burka and a long black coat many other @entity11 schools - including around a dozen state - funded schools - require female pupils to cover their hair			1
it comes after judge @entity75 , sitting at @entity39 's @entity76 , ruled it was ' crucial ' for jurors to be able to see a defendant 's face when giving evidence			0
the 22 - year - old in question , who can not be named for legal reasons , said it is against her religious beliefs to show her face in public			0
referred to in court as @entity91 ' , she entered a not guilty plea to a charge of intimidation last week while wearing a niqab after the judge backed down from a previous decision that she would have to show her face to be properly identified			0
meanwhile the topic of wearing veils in school has dominated headlines in recent weeks after @entity102 was made to retract a policy which forced pupils to remove veils while on the premises so they can be identified			2
home office minister @entity107 has called for a national debate on whether the state should step in to prevent young women having the veil imposed upon them			0
but home secretary @entity16 has said it is for women to ' make a choice ' about what clothes they wear , including veils , although there will be some circumstances when it will be necessary to ask for them to be removed			1
a student at @entity102 wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be ' easily identifiable at all times ' ' i start from the position that i do n't think @entity130 should tell people , i do n't think the government should tell women , what they should be wearing , ' mrs may said			0
' i think it 's for women to make a choice about what clothes they wish to wear , if they wish to wear a veil that is for a woman to make a choice			2
' there will be some circumstances in which it 's right for public bodies , for example at the border , at airport security , to say there is a practical necessity for asking somebody to remove a veil			0
' i think it 's for public bodies like the @entity154 officials , it 's for schools and colleges , and others like the judiciary , as we 've recently seen , to make a judgment in relation to those cases as to whether it 's necessary to ask somebody to remove the veil ' .			0

many @entity21 schools in @entity2 insist their pupils wear burkas or veils
covering up is the the ' desired dress code of a @entity11 female ' , they say
@entity16 says all women should be able to ' make a choice ' about dress
