clearly , as an @entity1 , i will be hoping we can put one over on the @entity3 on tuesday night at @entity4 in the world ’s oldest international football fixture			1
but part of me will be supporting at least one @entity3 player			0
when i first met @entity9 he was a very raw 19 - year - old , low on confidence but with loads of ability			1
he was playing for @entity14 in the @entity15 and stacking shelves at @entity17 during the day			0
but the last time i was in touch with him was a couple of months ago after he scored for @entity21 against world champions @entity23			1
his story is incredible and an inspiration to young players who think that being rejected by a club means the end of their dreams			1
‘ @entity31 ’ was in just that situation			0
he had been released by @entity32 as a 17 - year - old and spent 18 months out of the professional game			1
my former assistant , @entity60 , had known him at @entity32			1
so when we were holding trials for our academy , we tracked him down and asked him along			1
he thought that at 19 he was too old and his chance had gone			1
but he showed that he had blistering pace as a right winger			0
and all of the coaches there — @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , myself and @entity60 — recognised there was some raw material with which we could work			0
we took him down to the academy in @entity53 in southern @entity77 and he was with us for eight or nine months			2
there we developed him as a footballer and taught him about movement , positioning and how to use his pace			2
we also had to work on giving him some self - belief			2
he could n’t see in himself what we could see — and many of the lads down there were like that , given that their confidence had taken a big knock from being rejected			0
i used to joke with him that he was banned from the treatment room as he would often worry about an injury that was holding him back			0
of course , players need proper treatment for their injuries , but with @entity31 it was a case of giving him a more positive outlook , so that every muscle tweak did not become an issue that resulted in him being out for a few weeks			0
hopefully , we made him realise he had the talent — but he was the one who put the hard work in			0
he had the hunger and wanted to do it and just needed re-shaping a little mentally and tactically			0
he was always ready to listen and take advice on board			0
@entity35 had to play for sides such as @entity14 and @entity45 before joining @entity40 the 26 - year - old starred in @entity21 's recent 1 - 0 win against the @entity112 at @entity4 one day we played against @entity46 ’s b team and drew 1 - 1 and he absolutely tore them apart			1
they instantly wanted to have a look at him again			0
he went back for another game and again looked incredible — so they signed him on a two - year contract and he became the first player to leave the academy with a professional contract			1
he played for @entity46 ’s b team and then made some appearances for the first team before moving on to @entity48			1
his progress since then has been superb and he ended up with @entity49 , before being loaned to @entity40 , where he is now doing so well			1
we were all very proud when he made his @entity21 debut last year although he actually qualifies for four different countries , having a @entity132 father , a @entity134 mother , was born in @entity21 and raised in @entity135			1
that night he scored against @entity23 in september , everyone from the academy were texting each other — and @entity31 was in touch with us as well after the game			1
@entity35 plied his trade at @entity143 outfit @entity45 before his spell out in @entity77 @entity145 and @entity60 coached @entity35 when they were running an academy out in @entity77 i would n’t want to be too hard on the clubs which release these players — there can be a multitude of reasons why they are deemed not good enough at 16 or 17			1
in @entity31 ’s case , he had a bad injury and was playing catch - up at that age			2
you might not be physically mature enough at 17 but completely different physically at 21			2
perhaps the player does n’t fit the style the manager wants			0
it may well drag you down at that young age if you get the idea the club is n’t positive about you			0
in fact , so much can go against you			0
clubs have to release players — they ca n’t take everyone on			0
but my point is that many of those we initially discard can go on to enjoy good professional careers with a little guidance and help			2
unfortunately , the academy we were running in @entity77 could not get the long - term funding and eventually had to close			1
but i still wonder if it ’s an idea that the @entity185 , @entity186 and professional footballers ’ @entity184 might revive over here			2
i ’m sure it would be self - funding eventually if you were producing young players like @entity31			2
he is living proof that you can be cast on to football ’s scrapheap far too soon			0
and that for those who are , with help , there is a way back — even a route to international football and the chance to score against the world champions .			2
