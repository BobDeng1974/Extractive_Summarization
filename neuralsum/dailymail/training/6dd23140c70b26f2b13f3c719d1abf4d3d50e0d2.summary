by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 12 october 2013 a @entity2 officer is to be disciplined for racially discriminating against @entity4 ’s younger brother			1
the police watchdog has ordered the @entity6 to bring misconduct proceedings against the officer , who followed and stopped teacher @entity9 as he drove home in his car last november			1
the @entity6 ’s professional standards unit had previously cleared the officer of any wrongdoing			2
battle : @entity9 , pictured here with his mother @entity17 , will be pleased the case of racial discrimination against him is being investigated but after mr @entity4 appealed , the @entity20 has ruled that his allegation against the officer was ‘ well founded ’ and he should face a misconduct hearing			1
more than 20 other , unrelated allegations of racial discrimination – made against the @entity6 by mr @entity4 - were rejected by the @entity20			2
last night mr @entity4 urged @entity6 chief sir @entity25 to take ‘ robust and appropriate disciplinary action ’ against the officer who is facing misconduct proceedings			0
‘ there is no place in the police service for officers who conduct themselves as he did , ’ he told the @entity29			1
the decision to partially uphold mr @entity4 ’s appeal is seen as a major embarrassment for @entity2 chiefs			2
the public inquiry into the 1993 murder of his brother @entity41 , 18 , accused @entity2 of being ‘ institutionally racist ’			0
father - of - one @entity4 , 36 , lodged a formal complaint with the @entity6 in january ( 2013 ) , alleging he had been stopped or searched by officers on 25 occasions since the age of 17			1
tragic : in the years following @entity4 's death , his brother @entity48 was stopped by police on numerous occasions as revealed exclusively in the @entity29 , he claimed he had been targeted simply because of the colour of the skin			2
his patience finally snapped after he was stopped near the home he shared with his fiancée and young son in @entity58 , @entity60 - east @entity59 , on the afternoon of november 16 last year			0
he was driving his three year old @entity61 when two officers pulled him over and checked his details			0
mr @entity4 says that when he asked why he had been stopped , one of the officers replied he had been ‘ naturally suspicious ’ of him			1
after spending three months probing his various allegations , the @entity6 ’s @entity66 ( @entity67 ) concluded in april there was no evidence any of its officers acted inappropriately.but the @entity20 has now upheld mr @entity4 ’s complaint about last november ’s incident			1
the officer who was driving the police vehicle which followed mr @entity4 ’s car told investigators that he ( mr @entity4 ) had stared at him as he drove past			1
he said he noticed that the man at the wheel was @entity81 ‘ but could not make out any more than that ’			0
in its report , a copy of which has been seen by the @entity29 , the @entity20 said it did not find the ‘ eye contact ’ between mr @entity4 and the police officer provided a ‘ credible justification ’ for the decision to follow him			1
it added that it was more likely than not that mr @entity4 did not speed up or fail to indicate , as was alleged by the officer and a police colleague who was with him at the time			2
‘ on the balance of probability we conclude that the conduct took place as mr @entity4 has alleged , ’ it added			0
‘ in the absence of credible reasons as to why mr @entity4 was followed and questioned we consider that his complaint that this was on the grounds of ethnicity is well founded			0
’ according to the @entity20 report , 74 per cent of the police driver ’s stops between september 2012 and march 2013 were on @entity108 people			1
it recommended he face a misconduct hearing for racial discrimination			0
because he had never previously been in trouble and did n’t use offensive language in the incident with mr @entity4 , he is unlikely to lose his job			0
his colleague who was also involved in the altercation with mr @entity4 ( last november ) will not disciplined , the @entity20 said			2
this , it explained , is because there is no evidence he influenced the driver ’s decision to follow and stop mr @entity4 , and was not aware of his race until he got out of his car			1
mr @entity4 welcomed the @entity20 ’s decision to ‘ partially ’ uphold his appeal			1
he said : “ the @entity20 now recognises , on the basis of the evidence that it has seen , that the only reason i was stopped by police on the 16th november 2012 , was because of my ethnic origin			1
this is the conclusion that the original officer investigating my complaint should have reached			0
the fact that he did not do so caused me hurt and distress because it suggested that i was not telling the truth about what happened to me			0
it also shows how ineffective the complaints procedure is when police investigate police			0
‘ there are bound to be many miscarriages of justice because of this biased procedure			0
ultimately , it needs to be changed so that complaints are not investigated in a biased way and people in my position do not have to go through the stress and humiliation of not being believed when they make a complaint			0

@entity9 says he has been stopped by police at least 25 times
says that officers told him one time that they were ' naturally suspicious ' of him
@entity20 report , 74 per cent of the police driver ’s stops between september 2012 and march 2013 were on @entity108 people
