a fuel with no greenhouse emissions or radioactive waste that is almost unlimited , sounds too good to be true			0
but scientists have taken one more step to make fusion power useful and affordable			0
engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which , when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output			1
engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor ( pictured ) that , when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output until now no - one has come up with a fusion power plant design – dubbed the ‘ holy grail ’ of energy generation by many - that would produce fuel cheap enough to outperform systems that use fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas			1
fusion , the process that powers the sun and other stars , entails forging the nuclei of atoms to release energy , as opposed to splitting them , which is fission - the principle behind the atomic bomb and nuclear power			2
engineers from the @entity41 have published their design and analysis findings and will present them at the @entity45 ’s @entity44 in @entity46 , @entity47 , this week			2
‘ right now , this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept , ’ said @entity48 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the university			2
other designs , such as the experimental fusion reactor project called @entity58 ( its internals are pictured in a diagram ) which is currently being built in @entity61 have to be much larger than the university 's because they rely on superconducting coils that circle around the outside of the device to provide a similar magnetic field nuclear fusion is a process by which the nuclei of deuterium and tritium , both isotopes obtained from hydrogen , are fused together to create heavier particles			1
in theory , energy generated through fusion would leave no dangerous waste or pollute the atmosphere			0
and the fuel is found in abundance in seawater , which covers more than two - thirds of the planet			0
the process requires extreme temperatures and pressure equivalent to those found on our @entity89 and other active stars			0
while the idea started as a class project , professor @entity48 and a doctoral student in reactor design , @entity96 , refined the concept			2
the design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn			1
the reactor itself would be largely self - sustaining , meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions			0
heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity , similar to how a typical power reactor works			0
mr @entity96 said : ‘ this is a much more elegant solution because the medium in which you generate fusion is the medium in which you ’re also driving all the current required to confine it			0
’ there are several ways to create a magnetic field , which is crucial for keeping a fusion reactor going			1
the new design is known as a spheromak , meaning it generates the majority of magnetic fields by driving electrical currents into the plasma itself			2
this reduces the amount of required materials and allows researchers to shrink the overall size of the reactor			0
other designs , such as the experimental fusion reactor project called @entity58 , which is currently being built in @entity61 have to be much larger than the @entity41 ’s because they rely on superconducting coils that circle around the outside of the device to provide a similar magnetic field			1
the researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant ( stock image )			1
mr @entity96 said : ‘ if we do invest in this type of fusion , we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical			0
it ’s very exciting ' when compared with the fusion reactor concept in @entity61 , the new design is much less expensive at roughly one tenth of the cost of @entity58 and would produce five times as much energy			1
the researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant			1
they explained that building a fusion power plant producing 1 gigawatt ( 1 billion watts ) of power would cost $ 2.7 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) , while a coal plant of the same output would cost $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.8 billion ) , according to their analysis			1
mr @entity96 said : ‘ if we do invest in this type of fusion , we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical			0
’ the concept that has been created is around one - tenth the size and power output of a final product , which will take years to develop			1
it was funded by the @entity178 @entity177			0
the researchers have successfully tested the prototype ’s ability to sustain a plasma efficiently and as they further develop and expand the size of the device they can ramp up to higher - temperature plasma and get significant fusion power output .			2

engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor
when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , it would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output , they claim
design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur
engineers at the @entity41 claim the design is cheaper than building a coal power station - but warn a full - sized version is years away
