by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 18:01 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 03:15 est , 11 march 2014 paratrooper @entity2 of @entity4 in south @entity5 was offered only £ 570,000 after he was injured on the @entity7 frontline a @entity9 sailor has been paid £ 1million after injuring her back playing a drunken game during an @entity12 function			1
the 25 - year - old – who is still serving – was hurt plunging from the top of a human pyramid built by alcohol - fuelled troops as they larked about in the mess			1
in stark contrast , the compensation is double the amount paid to @entity2 , the most seriously hurt @entity22 soldier to survive the @entity7 frontline			1
then aged 23 , the paratrooper was blown up by a mine in 2006			0
he was left in a coma for months with 37 injuries , including losing both legs , damage to his spine , skull , pelvis , hands , spleen and ribcage			1
initially the @entity36 was offered just £ 152,000 plus a £ 19,000 - a - year pension			1
after a battle by his mother @entity40 and public outrage , the hero was awarded £ 570,000			1
this is now the maximum payout a soldier can receive for battlefield injuries from the @entity45			2
the sailor ’s injuries were described as ‘ very serious ’			1
although she is not understood to have been paralysed , it is believed she has problems with mobility			0
the deal is certain to undermine morale within @entity22 ’s beleaguered armed forces			0
it comes as the @entity45 pushes through severe cuts to save £ 4.7billion and plug a £ 38billion hole in the equipment programme			2
last night her payout after a six - year legal battle was condemned by @entity62 , a senior defence analyst and editor of @entity12 of the @entity22			1
he said : ‘ it seems utter madness to use such an enormous amount of taxpayers ’ money when there appears to be at least some negligence on the part of the person concerned			2
‘ if somebody sustains life - changing injuries on the battlefield , then everyone understands why they should receive compensation			2
but to foot a £ 1million bill for a drunken accident is nothing short of scandalous			2
‘ it is even more disgraceful that this can happen at a time when the @entity45 is facing such severe financial restraints			0
terribly injured in @entity7 and after learning to walk again on his new legs @entity88 , of the @entity89 lays a wreath at the remeberance service in @entity4 , @entity5 ‘ someone high up needs to answer some very searching questions			1
’ shadow armed forces minister @entity94 said : ‘ it ’s right that when our armed forces are injured on duty , they are compensated and , if required , looked after			0
‘ but this seems a very large sum given the financial constraints the @entity45 is under and [ defence secretary ] @entity103 should explain why			0
’ @entity104 , vice-chairman of the @entity105 , said ministers had only spent £ 6million investigating ill - health which affected 7,500 troops who fought in the 1991 conflict			1
@entity2 was seriously injured in a land mine explosion in @entity7 serving with 7 paratroopers , serving 37 injuries as the result of an explosion he said : ‘ it is absolutely outrageous that veterans who became ill serving their country are neglected for medical equipment and treatment , yet the government insists it ca n’t pay for more			1
this case really raises questions about where their priorities lie			0
’ the payment to the sailor is also more than 50 times the basic £ 17,767 salary of a private fighting the @entity127 in @entity7			1
better days : he lost both his legs and sustained grievous damage to his spine , skull , pelvis , hands , spleen and ribcage , leaving him in a coma for months the unnamed woman , who is understood not to be an officer and is now 31 , was attending the official event at a base on land			0
during the evening in 2007 , she became involved in ‘ drunken high jinks ’ with high - spirited troops climbing on each others ’ shoulders , sources told the @entity149			0
but the human tower collapsed and the servicewoman plummeted up to 30ft to the floor			2
the woman took legal action , arguing that top brass had responsibility for her well - being as she was invited to the event			2
in 2012 - 13 , the @entity12 ’ bill for civil cash claims topped £ 108.9million , up £ 21million on the previous financial year			1
the payouts were inflated by troops claiming that negligence by top brass caused their injuries as well as cases brought by @entity166 nationals alleging abuse by @entity22 forces			2
desk staff at the @entity45 pocketed £ 18million from 724 claims for a string of bizarre accidents , including a fractured leg from tripping over a frayed carpet			0
service personnel were behind another 2,517 payouts totalling £ 51.3million which did not include those injured on active duty			0
@entity45 officials have refused to give further details about the sailor ’s case but other awards have caused controversy			0
last november , it was revealed three female @entity188 recruits were each given £ 100,000 after suffering spinal and pelvic injuries caused by marching in step with taller male colleagues			1
in 2007 , the @entity45 paid £ 484,000 to an @entity188 typist who said she suffered repetitive strain injury to her thumb			0
a @entity149 campaign was prompted by anger at paltry sums for servicemen and women hurt on duty			0
in 2010 , huge rises in awards were announced by @entity203 .			0
