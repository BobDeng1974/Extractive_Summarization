by @entity1 reporter published : 14:07 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 14:07 est , 31 may 2012 dangerous : @entity3 member @entity2 , pictured here at 2003 local elections , is known to have a violent past police have been ordered to return private @entity8 footage of a firebomb attack to a man with a violent past - despite fears it could help him find and kill the person responsible			1
@entity15 @entity6 had argued for retaining footage belonging to @entity2 ' @entity17 , who had gangster connections , to avoid ' indirectly assisting or encouraging ' him to carry out a revenge attack for the arson attack on his mother 's home			1
but today two @entity25 judges disagreed with the plea from police , and ruled the force 's chief constable did not have power to retain the video from the @entity8 system set up by @entity32 , who had shortly before the fire released a book exposing ' wannabe gangsters ' and ' police informants ' in @entity37			1
two judges rejected the chief constable ’s appeal against a magistrates ’ court ruling that the footage should be returned under the provisions of the @entity6			0
sir @entity45 and mr justice @entity46 described in a joint written judgment how the mother ’s house in @entity37 was deliberately set on fire in june 2008			1
she was alone at the time but escaped without injury			0
the video footage was seized as part of subsequent police investigations			2
it showed a petrol can at the front door and the person believed to have caused the fire , though the images were unclear			0
despite all efforts , including enhancing the images , the police could not identity who had set the fire , and the investigation was closed			0
@entity32 applied to @entity71 magistrates court for the return of the tape in december 2008 but was opposed by the chief constable on the grounds that he might inflict violent injury on any person that he identified on it			1
@entity32 , a well - known gangland figure in @entity37 , has several violence - related convictions to his name and has even been charged with murder			2
in 1982 he served eight months behind bars for sending razor blades in the post to members of @entity37 's jewish community			0
he was again jailed in 1994 for carrying @entity92 gas and knuckle dusters while working as a clubland bouncer			0
in 1998 @entity32 was charged with the murder of a nightclub security boss , but the charge was eventually dropped when a key prosecution witness withdrew his evidence			2
det sgt @entity99 , who was in charge of the arson investigation , told the city court she believed that if @entity32 saw the tape he would ' seek revenge against the actual offender or a mistaken innocent third party ' , said the judges			1
she believed ' that person would be killed or seriously injured '			0
@entity32 had earlier identified to the police a possible suspect who had threatened him and asked to see the video as he thought he might be able to recognise the offender from his stance or gait			1
@entity116 had their claim to keep the @entity8 footage rejected at @entity119 's @entity25 today but city court deputy district judge @entity120 ruled that , although he understood det sgt @entity124 ’s concerns , they did not create special circumstances allowing the police to retain the footage under the provisions of the @entity128 , which dealt with ' ownership and nothing else '			1
upholding the district judge ’s decision , the @entity25 judges said that , as a matter of fundamental constitutional principle ' the powers of the executive to seize and retain goods ' were carefully controlled by the courts			1
they had to balance the interests of society in finding out wrongdoers and repressing crime against the freedom of the individual			0
to justify taking an article from a person who had not been arrested or charged , it was necessary for that article to be returned as soon as a case was over or a decision was made not to go on with it			0
as a result , the chief constable was not entitled to retain the @entity32 tape under the 1984 @entity156			1
the judges said they were prepared to assume that a court could refuse to order the police to return property if it was established that handing it back would indirectly assist or encourage crime			2
but there were no findings made by the district judge in the @entity32 case that supported such a conclusion			2
the judges ruled : ' it can not be sufficient that the police reasonably suspect that ( @entity32 ) might use the tape to commit a criminal act , for that would give the executive power to retain property without legislative or other authority			1
' it can only be if the court itself is satisfied that the use of its process would in fact indirectly assist in or encourage a crime that the court could refuse to allow its processes to be used to that end			0
' we therefore conclude that the appeal can not succeed on the facts stated in the case for the reasons we have given			0
the video must therefore be returned			0

@entity116 to hand film back to violent @entity3 member @entity2
@entity8 pictures showed firebomb attack on @entity32 ' mother 's house
officers feared giving cctv back to @entity32 will help him find and kill arsonist in revenge attack
