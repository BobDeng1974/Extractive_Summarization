by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 15 december 2013 controversial plans have been drawn up to slash up to £ 5 billion a year from the welfare bill by limiting child benefit to families ’ first two children			1
under the proposal , revealed today , families would also lose their entitlement to child tax credit for any more than two children			1
the change would mean parents with three children , who would currently be entitled to child benefit because their annual income is less than £ 50,000 , would lose out on £ 696 a year			1
on top of that , those earning less than £ 30,000 will also be denied child tax credits worth £ 2,725 a year – making them in total £ 65 a week worse off			1
controversial : families are set to lose their entitlement to child tax credit for any more than two children under new plans revealed by @entity23 today ( library image ) the initiative has been put forward by @entity27 mp @entity26 , recently appointed by @entity28 to the no 10 policy board to come up with vote - winning policies for the conservative election manifesto			1
mr @entity26 is a close ally of chancellor @entity32 , who said last week he was determined to find billions of pounds of extra savings in the welfare budget			1
opinion polls show strong public support for welfare cuts and the @entity38 say it is vital to encourage greater responsibility			0
but the idea is likely to be criticised by @entity41 as an attack on hard - up families			2
the @entity38 say it is ‘ nonsense ’ to call the idea ‘ social engineering ’ or compare it to @entity46 ’s ‘ one child policy ’ to curb population growth			2
mr @entity26 wants the two - child cap included in the next @entity27 manifesto and introduced in 2015 if they win			1
it would apply to those who had a third child from then onwards , not to families with more than two children now			2
the move is certain to be fiercely opposed by mr @entity28 ’s @entity60 partner , @entity61 deputy prime minister @entity59			0
benefits reforms are vital to save taxpayers ’ money , says mr @entity26 in an article in today ’s @entity66			2
the welfare state was set up in the 1940s as a ‘ last resort , not a lifestyle choice ’ , he writes			0
proposals : @entity27 mp @entity26 , right , who has recently been appointed by @entity28 to the no. 10 policy board , put forward the plans but over the years , ‘ the safety net became a straitjacket , ’ trapping people into a life of dependency on the state – at someone ’s else expense			1
‘ many couples take the decision to delay having a third or a fourth child until they are sure they can afford it , ’ he argues			0
‘ this should be case for every family , regardless of their income			0
’ people had to understand ‘ welfare will always be there to help them take responsible decisions about work and family			0
in return , they can no longer assume the taxpayer has a bottomless purse			0
' capping welfare by family size would save billions and help the next generation think more carefully about their relationship with the welfare state			0
and it would restore the original bargain made between citizens and state : a safety net in return for personal responsibility			0
’ the @entity38 have already scrapped child benefit for higher rate taxpayers earning more than £ 50,000 a year			1
two years ago , a similar @entity27 plan to cap child benefit to families on the dole with two children was vetoed by mr @entity59			1
mr @entity26 ’s proposal goes much further , and would end all child benefits and child tax credits after the second child			1
with certain opposition from @entity41 and the @entity61 , it will only have a realistic chance of becoming law if the @entity27 win an outright majority in the election , due in may 2015			2
support for such welfare curbs grew after the scandal of unemployed @entity134 man @entity133 , who was convicted of killing six of his 17 children by five women in a house fire			2
he was accused of using his children as a ‘ cashcow ’ to generate £ 60,000 a year in benefits			1
mr @entity32 provoked @entity41 anger by saying the ‘ horrendous ’ @entity133 case justified a nationwide debate ‘ about the welfare state and taxpayers who subsidise lifestyles like that			0
’ the @entity38 believe voters are on their side , though some conservative mps fear that radical welfare cuts run the risk of the party being caricatured as ‘ the @entity156 ’ – an image mr @entity28 has worked hard to shrug off			0
uproar : mr @entity26 's proposals are bound to be unpopular with deputy prime minister @entity59 labour leader @entity159 has attacked @entity27 welfare cuts such as the ‘ bedroom tax ’ and is likely to seize on mr @entity26 ’s plan as further evidence that mr @entity28 and mr @entity32 are out of touch with ordinary people struggling to make ends meet			1
but private @entity41 polls show that mr @entity159 ’s own supporters want him to take a tougher stance on welfare abuse			0
last night , senior ministers said mr @entity26 was speaking in a personal capacity			2
the trend for big families is already on the wane in @entity176			0
ten years ago , a third of all families had three or more children			0
but now the proportion has slumped to just one in four			0
the effect of the proposed benefits cap is most starkly illustrated by the example of a household with three children , in which the parents ’ combined income is £ 30,000 a year			1
under the current system , the family are entitled to £ 2,447 a year in child benefit payments and £ 2,940 in child tax credits , deducted from the tax bill			1
but under the proposed plan , their child benefit payments would be slashed by £ 696 a year to £ 1,751			1
and their child tax credits would fall by £ 2,725 a year to just £ 220			1
the total annual loss for the family would be £ 3,421 – or £ 65 a week			0
currently , about 1.2 million families have more than two children			0
of these , about a million qualify for child benefit			0
in total , more than 150,000 people who have been claiming @entity204 for over a year have three or more children : 57,000 have four or more			2
almost 200 families reliant on out - of - work benefits have at least ten children .			2

parents with three children would lose out on £ 696 a year in plan
those earning less than £ *30k* will also be denied credits worth £ 2,725
