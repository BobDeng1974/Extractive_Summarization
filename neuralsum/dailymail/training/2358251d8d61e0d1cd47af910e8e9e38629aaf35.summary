hundreds of millions of people worldwide were unable to use @entity1 and @entity2 for around an hour today			1
hackers from online group @entity4 have claimed they shut down the two sites at around 6am gmt - but @entity7 's social media empire says it was just a technical fault			1
both sites , which have a total of 1.5billion users , appeared with error messages in the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 for around an hour			2
the social media blackout also affected the dating mobile app @entity17 , as well as @entity18 and @entity19			1
there were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over @entity12 's east coast may have knocked out its servers			2
while it was down @entity1 said they were ' aware ' of trouble accessing the site and added : ' we 're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible			2
' a spokesman later added : ' earlier today many people had trouble accessing @entity1 and @entity2			1
this was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems			1
@entity4 's facebook page after claiming it hacked @entity51 and @entity52 the @entity4 took credit for bringing down the @entity54 's @entity52 , and @entity51 's @entity51 online networks , hitting users on christmas day			1
the hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms ' poor security			2
the consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions			0
one of the most popular features of the consoles , for example , is the ability to play against friends and other users			0
while an internet connection is not required to play all games , new @entity69 consoles need to be online to be successfully set - up			2
many of those who received the consoles as @entity75 presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started			0
furthermore , games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully , which was ruled out by the hack			0
a message on the @entity52 status page at the weekend said its core services were ' up and running '			2
@entity51 engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online , but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems , as thousands of users log back on			1
' we moved quickly to fix the problem , and both services are back to 100 per cent for everyone			0
' an @entity2 spokesman posted on @entity94 : ' we 're aware of an outage affecting @entity2 and are working on a fix			1
thank you for your patience			0
' there is no word at this time what is causing the outage , and whether or not it might have anything to do with the ongoing blizzard , which is expected to dump 36 inches of snow in parts of @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , where key servers are based			2
the headquarters of @entity1 are located in @entity115 , @entity116 - an area which has not been affected by the storm			1
the hashtag # facebookdown and # socialmeltdown2015 immediately started tending on @entity94 , which remains operational			0
@entity1 had 1.25 billion monthly active users at the end of september last year , while photo - sharing service @entity2 has 300 million active monthly users uploading around 70 million photos per day			1
@entity124 , an engineer at @entity1 , posted on to the @entity126 's website to alert app creators to the ' major outage ' which he said lasted up to an hour between around 6.10am and 7.10am			1
' our engineers identified the cause of the outage and recovered the site quickly , ' he wrote			0
' thank you for your patience			0
we are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you and the users of your apps			0
' the @entity4 is a group of hackers that has caused havoc in the online world before , taking credit for attacks that took down the @entity148 and @entity54 's @entity150 network last month			1
this morning the group tweeted ' @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity152 '			1
previously it claimed responsibility for the @entity75 attack on @entity52 and @entity51 games consoles which saw online services disabled			1
in an interview with @entity158 , one of the group 's hackers , who called himself ' member one ' , said he enjoyed identifying weaknesses in the web security of global companies			2
' i would n't call myself a top - grade hacker - i know people who are way better than me			0
it 's fair to say i know my stuff though , ' he said			0
' with me , when people , friends of mine , go out clubbing , partying , i did n't enjoy it so i decided to sit at home and learn more skills of my own			0
' maybe this is n't something most people enjoy and think it was a good decision but for us it was something that we just decided upon			0
' he added that ' huge , global companies ' with teams of technicians should be able to protect their network security from hackers who have ' barely lived '			0
previous : yesterday the @entity4 claimed they had brought down the @entity194 website @entity195 : millions who tried to log on to @entity1 and @entity2 saw these blank screens this morning the latest outage sparked panic online , but the majority retained a sense of humour another user @entity203 wrote : ' now that facebook is down , i might actually have to ask people how they 're feeling in real life			1
' what 's on your mind ? '' @entity212 joked : ' if @entity1 & @entity2 are down how am i supposed to know what my aunt had for dinner or if any of my friends held a @entity218 cup today ? ? ? ' on a more serious note , less than 30 minutes into the shutdown , a hacker group known as the @entity4 claimed responsibility for the outage			1
in august , it also tweeted to @entity225 that there might be explosives on a plane carrying the president of @entity230 , which makes video games , forcing the flight to be diverted			0
yesterday , it claimed to have targeted the @entity194 website , leaving a message saying ' @entity236 ' and declaring it part of their ' cyber caliphate ' users logging on to the site of @entity244 's national carrier were greeted with the picture of a lizard in a top hat , monocle and tuxedo , smoking a pipe			1
the image was surrounded by the message ' 404 plane not found ' , an apparent reference to the airlines ' unexplained loss of flight mh370 last year with 239 people aboard			0
the extent of any links with the @entity261 , however , are not yet known			0
the jihadist group has seized large swathes of @entity264 and @entity265 in a brutal campaign and declared an independent @entity268 ' caliphate '			0
it also has used social media to recruit and spread its message			1
@entity4 is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective @entity275 and is described as ' vocal , taunting and bit obnoxious '			1
the group seeks to cause mayhem online ' for a laugh ' and has called itself the ' next generation @entity280 ' after the children 's character that hates @entity75 , often using @entity94 to boast of upcoming attacks			2
some reports say it mainly operates from @entity286 but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world , communicating using the ' dark web '			0
@entity4 has a history of targeting computer game companies , particularly @entity51			1
in august it sent a bomb threat to @entity51 chief executive @entity296 , the same month in which it attacked @entity51 just to cause ' havoc '			2
@entity300 , of online security company @entity301 , said : ' if they 're coming after you , you 're going to have a bad day			0

millions locked out of @entity1 and @entity2 for around an hour
hackers from the online group @entity4 have claimed responsibility
@entity7 's social media sites have denied it was a cyber attack
blamed the outage on ' a change that affected our configuration systems '
@entity18 , @entity17 and @entity320 were also claimed to have been offline
@entity4 hit @entity194 , @entity51 and @entity52 in past month
