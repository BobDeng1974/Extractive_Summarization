by @entity0 after a young woman was brutally gang raped and murdered in december 2012 , the endemic violence against women and girls in @entity4 became front page news across the world			1
but as @entity10 reveals in his latest documentary , @entity4 's rape epidemic is just the tip of the iceberg			1
the country is also home to a trafficking trade that involves an astonishing 100 million people - 10 per cent of the population - and sees girls as young as nine being sold into the sex trade			1
@entity21 : prostitutes wait for clients on a @entity25 street corner			1
many are victims of trafficking man on a mission : @entity10 delves into @entity4 's seedy underbelly in search of traffickers among them is 12 - year - old @entity34 , who was taken from her @entity36 home by traffickers when she was just 10 years old			1
now back with her parents after escaping , @entity34 is one of the few to be reunited with her family - most , sadly , are ostracised , even if they were forced into prostitution against their will			2
' he told me he could get me work , ' she explains of the day she met the man who would make her life a misery for the next two years			2
' i was at school			2
he promised me food and a nice job paying two to three thousand rupees ( Â£ 23 ) a month			2
' she agreed to go with him but her dream of a bright future soon turned into a nightmare			2
' he would get drunk , fondle me and rape me everywhere , ' she says , facing @entity10 and the camera with almost heroic frankness			2
' it was anally , vaginally and orally			2
it was twice a day for two years			2
if i complained i was beaten			0
in the end i escaped			0
' she adds : ' they [ traffickers ] are bad people who make lots of girls suffer			1
' like @entity34 , the destination for most of the girls is one of @entity4 's megalopolises , with @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity25 among the most popular			1
@entity25 , @entity4 's most populous city , is also home to its largest concentration of sex workers , housed in a red light district that is the largest in @entity79			1
@entity80 : like these women , photographed on @entity25 's @entity82 , many victims are in their teens exploitation : shockingly , prostitutes make as little as 23p a time from the men who use them here , women , many of them trafficked , are forced to work around the clock , controlled by violent pimps and policed by vicious criminal gangs			0
and it 's not just bandits involved in the trade - local journalists report that the police , local politicians and government officials all get a slice of the lucre			1
one of the women who work in @entity25 's vice trade is @entity105 , a 27 - year - old who was trafficked from village near @entity107 as a 12 - year - old			1
' i was still at school when i was brought here , ' she remembers			0
' i was promised a job as a bottle washer			0
i said ok but they sold me into this dirty trade			1
' they locked me in a room and the customers started coming up and i was a sex worker			1
' speaking of the first ' client ' she ever encountered , she says : ' they told him i was a virgin and he had paid lots of money for that			0
' unlike @entity34 , she can not go home to her family			0
' at home , having sex outside of marriage is taboo , ' she explains			1
' they would have killed me and thrown my body in the river			0
' victims : most trafficked girls come from @entity36 , which is poor and has a reputation for beautiful women tough job : people in @entity36 make their living in the dangerous brick kilns or as prawn fishermen but things are scarcely any easier for the families denuded of their daughters , many of whom live in the desperately poor @entity36 region			1
among those to have lost their children to traffickers is @entity152 , whose 12 - year - old daughter has been missing for a year			1
' i was working in the field , i do n't know how they got her , ' she says of the day her child was taken			0
' she was at home when i left at six in the morning			0
when i got home at 2pm , she was gone			0
she was nowhere to be found			0
' now , mrs @entity152 fears that her daughter is in the hands of a pimp			0
' i 'm afraid she 's been sold and i do n't know what they are making her do , ' she says as tears roll down her lined cheeks			0
' i think she 's been sold			0
what else ? what else apart from the sex trade could it be ? ' i hope she comes back			1
i am desperate for her to come back			0
only @entity173 knows what is happening to her			0
' with 20,000 girls trafficked from @entity36 every year alone , according to @entity4 government statistics , the chances of mrs @entity152 's daughter living a safe and happy life elsewhere would appear to be slim			1
@entity10 : @entity181 , tonight at 9pm on @entity182			0

an *estimated* 100 million people are thought to be involved in trafficking
