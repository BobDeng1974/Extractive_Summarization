by @entity0 , @entity1 the chief prosecutor in @entity4 ' murder trial said on thursday that the double - amputee athlete 's lawyers have floated more than one theory in a dishonest attempt to defend against a murder charge for his killing of girlfriend @entity12			1
prosecutor @entity13 made the allegation during final arguments in the sensational trial in a @entity18 courthouse , where the fathers of the @entity21 runner and @entity12 , a model and television personality , were in court for the first time since the trial began in early march			1
they sat at opposite ends of a long bench in the gallery			0
@entity13 said a criminal trial was a ' blunt instrument for digging up the truth ' but that he was confident of his case			2
he then said defense lawyers had argued that @entity4 acted in self - defense , fearing an intruder was in the house , but also raised the possibility that the once - celebrated athlete was not criminally responsible , accidentally shooting @entity12 through a closed toilet door because he was ' startled			1
' ' it 's two defenses that you can never reconcile , ' @entity13 said			0
the defense has previously contended that he fired by mistake , thinking he was about to be attacked by an assailant in the toilet and that @entity12 was in the bedroom			2
in addition to the murder charge , @entity4 faces three separate gun - related charges , one of which stems from his alleged firing of a shot in a crowded restaurant called @entity71 in @entity72 , months before he killed @entity12			1
he has pleaded not guilty to all charges			0
on thursday , some of the state 's written arguments as well as transcripts of past testimony appeared on screens in the courtroom			0
one section questioned @entity4 ' defense case : ' is it putative self - defense ? is it an act of sane automatism ? did he have criminal capacity to act ? or was it all an accident as in @entity91 where he had the gun in his hand and it purportedly discharged itself ? ' because @entity96 has no trial by jury , judge @entity95 will decide with the help of two legal assistants if @entity4 committed murder , is guilty of a negligent killing , or if he made a tragic error and should be acquitted			1
@entity12 's parents @entity105 ( @entity106 ) and june ( @entity107 ) arive at the high court , @entity18 @entity4 faces 25 years to life if convicted of the murder the runner faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder , and also would be sent to prison for years if guilty of murder without premeditation or culpable homicide			1
earlier , @entity95 told @entity13 and chief defense lawyer @entity119 that they had only until the end of friday to complete their final arguments in court			2
' unless , of course , you want to work on a saturday and perhaps sunday , after church , ' she said , smiling			0
