ancient legends of @entity2 mariners using mysterious sunstones to reveal the position of the sun on a cloudy day may well be true , according to a new study			1
before the invention of the compass , @entity8 adventurers travelled thousands of kilometres across the oceans toward @entity12 and most likely as far as @entity13 centuries ahead of @entity14			2
evidence shows that these fearless seamen navigated by reading the position of the sun and stars along with an intimate knowledge of landmarks , currents and waves			1
inventive : a new study claims to have revealed how the @entity26 were able to navigate on cloudy days with a sunstone but how they could voyage such distances across seas at northern latitudes while hampered by light obscuring clouds and fog remained a mystery			2
while experts have long argued that @entity26 knew how to use blocks of light - fracturing crystal to locate the sun through dense clouds , archeologists have never found solid proof			1
doubts also remained as to exactly what kind of material it might be			2
an international team of researchers led by @entity48 of the @entity49 in @entity50 , says they have the answer			0
ancient - day sat nav : the refractive properties of calcite crystal - otherwise known as @entity56 spar - were used to pinpoint the sun through clouds according to the new study , the @entity26 would have relied upon the sun 's piercing rays being reflected through a piece of the calcite crystal			1
researchers found that if you put a dot on top of the crystal and look through it from below , two dots will appear due to the double refraction of the @entity56 spar			1
using this , they could pinpoint the sun by rotating the crystal until both sides of the double image are of equal intensity			1
at that angle , the upward - facing surface indicates the direction of the sun , according to the scientists led by dr @entity48			2
a precision of a few degrees can be reached even under dark twilight conditions , so the @entity26 would have been able to determine with precision the direction of the hidden @entity84 the human eye , he added , has a fine - tuned capacity to distinguish between shades of contrast , and thus is able to see when the two spots are truly identical			0
vikings , they argue , used transparent calcite crystal - also known as @entity56 spar - to fix the true bearing of the @entity84 to within a single degree of accuracy			1
the naturally occurring stone has the capacity to ' depolarise ' light , filtering and fracturing it along different axes , the researchers explained			0
the recent discovery of an @entity56 spar aboard an @entity106 ship sunk in 1592 - tested by the researchers - bolsters the theory that ancient mariners were aware of the crystal 's potential as an aid to navigation			1
even in the era of the compass , crews might have kept such stone on hand as a backup , the study speculates			0
' we have verified that even only one of the cannons excavated from the ship is able to perturb a magnetic compass orientation by 90 degrees , ' the researchers wrote			0
' so , to avoid navigation errors when the @entity84 is hidden , the use of an optical compass could be crucial even at this epoch , more than four centuries after the @entity2 time			0
' the study appeared in @entity131 : @entity132 and physical sciences , a peer - reviewed journal published by @entity136 's de facto academy of science , the @entity135			0
@entity14 , eat your heart out : vikings most likely used the sunstone to sail as far afield as @entity13			0
