with 60 years of managerial experience between them , @entity0 and @entity1 have more big match experience than most coaches still involved in @entity7 football			1
they have , as they saying goes , forgotten more about the game than many people will ever know			2
games like this , however , still throw up unique questions and challenges , both before and during play , and on monday night he two men faced one of their biggest nights of the season in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win			1
here , @entity24 assesses how they shaped up at @entity26			0
@entity27 managers are paid to make the right calls and sometimes that involves an element of risk			0
@entity1 ’s decision to include @entity34 ahead of @entity35 seemed baffling			1
@entity35 had scored five goals in his last five games and it was hard to think @entity34 would have anything in his repertoire that his former team - mates in the @entity43 ranks did n’t know all about			1
for an hour here it seemed as though the @entity47 manager had blundered a little			1
@entity47 were familiarly quick and progressive through midfield but @entity34 seemed unable to hold of possession long enough to bring his supporting players @entity51 and @entity52 in to play			1
@entity47 left back @entity53 jumps in the air after putting his side in the lead @entity43 captain @entity57 cancelled out @entity53 's opener ultimately , though , @entity1 ’s decision was vindicated when @entity34 was bright enough to anticipate @entity60 ’s back pass and calm enough to win his subsequent challenge with @entity62 and score the winner			1
for their part , it was surprising to see @entity43 without their best passer , @entity67 , but they still had a bold look about them at the start and that was indicative of the fact that this was a game @entity75 wished to win at the first attempt			0
@entity77 was selected as @entity43 ’s only holding player and that , in turn , released @entity80 and @entity81 to try and hurt @entity47 further up the field			1
most interesting , though , was @entity75 ’s decision to select @entity84 as a traditional winger			0
@entity84 has looked good going forward from left - back this season and by shunting him further up the field , @entity75 gave him licence to trouble young @entity90			1
it was a plan that worked early on , as @entity90 was booked for a foul , but @entity84 could n’t maintain the threat and spent too much time in his own half			0
@entity84 celebrates with @entity57 following the @entity43 and @entity98 captain 's equaliser tactics and style @entity1 is nothing if not brave when it comes to these games and that was reflected in his decision to pair @entity106 and @entity107 as central players			1
some @entity47 supporters may have wanted their team to look rather more secure and at times the visiting team did look vulnerable when @entity81 edge forwards to impose his unique brand of physicality on to the @entity47 central defenders			2
@entity47 ’s three - man attacking formation took a while to click but the holders ’ full - backs @entity90 and @entity53 got significant change out of their opposite numbers , forcing them back , and this allowed the visiting team to stretch the play in a fashion that made @entity43 look distinctly uncomfortable			1
@entity106 ( second left ) vies for the ball with @entity43 trio @entity84 , @entity77 and @entity81 when @entity43 did have the ball it was clear they had been instructed to play with more urgency			2
certainly @entity75 ’s team moved the ball more quickly early on and tried to deliver telling balls between two @entity47 central defenders that can be vulnerable , something that paid dividends when @entity57 equalised			2
unfortunately , this is not a @entity43 team that has any great confidence or belief and as soon as things started to go wrong their game plan fell apart to the extent that the final 20 minutes saw them launch a succession of long balls up towards @entity81			2
that , it must be said , was startlingly unsophisticated			0
one final question , here : if @entity57 is the man chosen to take your free - kicks from out wide , just what does that say for the abilities of @entity84 and @entity153 ? @entity154 @entity1 once got so animated here that he ended up standing on the platform behind the dug - outs after being sent from his seat			1
it was not a good look but then his team were on the brink of a defeat at the time so perhaps he was to be excused signs of madness			0
on monday night he was visible at times and contributed a lovely 360 degree dance after the first goal			2
a place in @entity170 beckons in retirement , perhaps			0
@entity75 , meanwhile , rarely ventures from his seat and whether that is the right thing or not depends on whether you think footballers actually benefit from a frantic man in a suit screaming at them while they are trying to put in to practice the things they have spent all week rehearsing			0
as usual , @entity75 spent much of the time sitting down whilst scribbling mysteriously on his big black clipboard			0
it will be some letter home by the time the season ends and , sadly for him , will not include any stories about @entity183			0
@entity1 ( left ) was animated on the touchline during @entity47 's win against @entity43 @entity186 @entity75 sees football as an 18 - man game and his use of substitutes – both good and bad – has been a feature of his time at @entity26 , just as it was during last summer ’s @entity193			1
here , the @entity43 manager saw his team very much in the game and gathering momentum towards the end of the first half but then made two changes during the interval			0
it is hard to say they worked , the hooking of @entity205 and @entity80 serving only to rob @entity43 of any impetus			0
@entity205 was taken off in the second half for @entity43 after proving to be ineffective on the left equally , the early subs left @entity75 with no wild card as @entity43 chased the game late on			0
as a result , @entity212 remained on the bench			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , was prepared to wait a little longer but his hand was forced when @entity52 was injured immediately after the interval			2
@entity1 ’s response was positive , sending on a like - for - like replacement in @entity219			1
verdict if you come away with a victory on a night like this then you win the duel , it ’s as simple as that			2
@entity1 gambled with his selection and tactics and knew he would be criticised if it did n’t come off			1
managers are paid to make the decisive calls , however , and to the victor the spoils			0
@entity0 ( middle ) issues instructions to @entity43 midfielder @entity84 the @entity236 points the way during his side 's @entity239 quarter - final win against @entity43			1

@entity47 beat @entity242 2 - 1 in their @entity239 quarter - final clash on monday
@entity34 came back to haunt his former side with the winner for @entity1 's men
@entity0 's substitutes proved to be too *defensive* on the night
whereas @entity1 gambled with his tactics and reaped the *rewards*
@entity47 will play either @entity254 or @entity255 in the semi finals
