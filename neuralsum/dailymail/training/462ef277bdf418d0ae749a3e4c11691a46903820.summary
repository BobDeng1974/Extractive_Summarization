by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 16:53 est , 20 august 2013 air passengers could soon be offered super-fast broadband to use the internet while flying			1
the service , using new satellite technology , could even be faster than most people get at home , allowing travellers to enjoy online activities such as streaming films and music			1
even if it does not reach the highest possible speeds , it would still be ten to 20 times faster than the limited internet services currently offered by a handful of airlines			1
end of an era : having to wait until you land to check your emails or @entity21 page could soon be over as new satellite technology could provide airline passengers with super-fast broadband while in the sky ( stock image ) the broadcast regulator @entity26 is considering whether to approve use of the new technology – called @entity29 on @entity30 – which would also be available on trains and cruise ships from next year			1
it could offer broadband at 50mbps ( megabits per second ) – compared with 14.7mbps for the average home connection – although technology experts believe 10mbps is more realistic			1
it uses advanced receivers to pick up signals from high - frequency satellites , even when the vehicles they are fitted to are travelling fast			0
it is not known how much the service would cost and companies are likely to sign up to offer it only if there is a high demand from customers			0
satellite internet does not use telephone lines or cable systems to link customers to the web but instead uses a satellite in space to transmit data			1
almost all ships have terminals in built that can send data to satellites which in turn connect to earth stations or mobile platforms on land which are connected to the internet			2
planes can use antennas placed on the craft which operate in the same way to allow people on - board to connect to the internet			2
after the antennas have transmitted data to a satellite , it is then sent to the nearest earth station			0
once there , the internet request is dealt with in the same way it would be if it were on a land - based internet connection before the information is pinged back to the web user on the plane via the satellite			2
this service is already available or being trialled by different airlines but is incredibly slow			0
satellite operators now hope to launch satellites with new technology which will be placed in geostationary obit			0
they operate on a different frequency to those already in use and transmit significantly more data at faster speeds			1
companies such as @entity98 own their own earth stations so they will be able the data 's entire journey from being transmitted to the satellite on to a land base and back again			2
@entity26 has launched a consultation on the new technology which could be up and running by the beginning of next year			1
it will then be up to individual airlines if they want to pay the satellite operator for the service so their customers can access super-fast broadband			1
current in - flight offerings are extremely slow			0
on some @entity117 business - class flights , for example , passengers can send texts and receive limited data on @entity121 mobile networks			1
they are charged international roaming rates by their mobile phone carriers			0
even a broadband trial on @entity127 ’s @entity126 aircraft to the @entity128 and @entity129 only offers speeds of around 432kbps ( kilobits per second )			0
the airline has yet to decide how much to charge			0
@entity26 ’s policy director , @entity134 , said : ‘ recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it ’s now possible for planes , ships and trains to access the internet at speeds closer to what you ’d expect from home broadband			1
‘ @entity26 is proposing to allow the use of this technology in the @entity148 , which could benefit business users and holidaymakers who want to stay connected while travelling			2
’ the reason the broadband service will be so much faster than those already on the market is because the new satellites work on a higher frequency than those currently in use and are capable of carrying more data to individual receptors placed on moving vehicles			1
satellite companies hoping to offer this technology claim they can offer speeds of up to 50 mega-bits per second ( mbps ) - a significant improvement on the average 430kbps broadband service currently being tested by some airlines			1
in comparison , the proposed 50mbps service would be more than three times the average home broadband speed of 14.7mbps			1
if @entity26 clears the way for the new broadband technology , it will be up to satellite providers to open up the service so private companies such as airlines can decide if they want to pay for it			1
private companies can then offer the super-fast broadband service to their customers			1
but it will be up to the companies how much they will charge for the high - speed access			2
as the satellites will initially provide the broadband directly to jets , boats or trains , the technology will not immediately impact on individual 's broadband services			2
but in theory , the satellite companies could offer their faster satellite broadband to homeowners as well as large corporations in the future			1
airlines have welcomed the consultation on the new technology - entitled @entity29 on @entity30			2
companies such as @entity127 are already trialling on - board @entity208 to see how much demand there is from their customers			2
but the current @entity208 available is much slower than service the new satellite technology would offer			2
it is not known how much this service will cost and companies are only likely to sign up to the satellite service if there is a high demand for it from customers			2
big interest : airlines , including @entity127 , pictured , and @entity117 , have welcomed the consultation a @entity127 spokeswoman said : ' @entity127 has noted this @entity26 consultation with interest			2
' we welcome any developments that can enhance the passenger experience and are always looking for new and innovative ways to do this on our aircraft			0
if these proposals become a reality we would be interested in looking into this further			0
' however our current focus is a @entity208 trial across some of our long haul flights , which we hope to roll out more widely next year			0
' @entity117 also welcomed the consultation @entity117 inflight entertainment and technology manager @entity239 said : ' we are always interested in employing new technology to improve the service that we can offer our customers , and are closely monitoring developments in the connectivity market in both the satellite and direct air - to - ground technology areas			1
' we are about to embark upon a year long connectivity trial using one of our @entity251 's fitted with a broadband satellite system			2
' customers travelling on our international routes will be able to access the internet as well as stream media content including live television channels to their personal devices			0
the trial will allow us to test customer demand for such services to help inform our product strategy			0
' while companies in the @entity148 are still trialling offering internet access on - board their flights , @entity262 offers its passengers a day @entity208 pass on its domestic flights at a cost of up to $ 21.95 ( around £ 14 )			1
an international duration of flight pass costs $ 19			0
but the company does not list the speed of its @entity208 access on its website			0
the consultation is likely to involve some of the world 's biggest satellite operators such as @entity98 and @entity278			0
if it proves to be a success the technology could be available as early as next year			0
@entity98 hopes to launch three of these new satellites at the end of the year			0
they will be placed in geostationary obit over the equator and , the company claims , will be able to provide super-fast broadband anywhere in the world			1
advanced : new satellites will be able to provide super-fast broadband by operating on a higher frequency than those currently in operation ( @entity98 image ) @entity297 , vice president of aviation at @entity98 said : ' @entity98 ’s @entity299 ( @entity300 ) will be the world 's first global super-fast broadband service and it is going to revolutionise mobile connectivity on land , at sea and in the air			1
' we have invested $ 1.2bn in @entity300 and the first of our three spacecraft is scheduled to be launched later this year , followed by a further two satellites in 2014			0
' based on ka - band technology , each satellite has a combination of fixed narrow spot beams that enable us to deliver higher speeds through more compact terminals ; and steerable beams so additional capacity can be directed in real - time to where it 's needed			1
' through gx , airline passengers can remain connected wherever they fly			0
@entity322 will enable them to connect their smartphones , tablets and laptops or any other @entity208 - enabled device to the @entity327 and enjoy a broadband experience akin to what they have at home or in the office			0
' @entity26 policy director @entity134 said : ' the internet has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives , with many people wanting to stay connected when they are travelling			0
' this might be updating their @entity21 status , sending a work email , or checking the latest news headlines			0
' @entity26 has been working with its @entity343 counterparts for the past two years to create a framework to allow the introduction of new satellite technology that will significantly increase the connection speeds for these travellers			1
' he added : ' recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it ’s now possible for planes , ships and trains to access the internet at speeds closer to what you ’d expect from home broadband			1
' @entity26 is proposing to allow the use of this technology in the @entity148 , which could benefit business users and holiday makers who want to stay connected while travelling			0

passengers currently only have limited access to the internet on flights
new satellite technology could provide super-fast broadband on moving transport such as planes , trains and cruise ships
it uses a higher frequency than those in use so can carry much more data
satellite companies claim they can provide broadband speeds of up to 50mbps - compared to the average home broadband speed of @entity386
@entity26 has launched consultation on whether it should be given go - ahead
if approved , broadband which is ten times faster than any currently available on moving *transportation* could reach customers by next year
