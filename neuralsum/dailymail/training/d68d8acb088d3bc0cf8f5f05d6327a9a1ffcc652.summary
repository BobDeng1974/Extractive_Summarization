there is possibly one rugby ball in the entire building , but @entity3 manages to find it and cradle it in his arms for the whole interview			1
here is a man who has spent most of his life with a ball in his hands — developing such a natural connection that it has almost become a fifth limb			2
as a player , he relied on guile and sleight of hand			2
these are traits that , he believes , are becoming devalued in a changing arena where junior players spend more time lifting weights than honing their skills			1
there is a diminishing marketplace for ‘ spindly little kids ’ — the words used to describe @entity3 when he arrived at his first @entity30 training session in 1999 — but the @entity31 believes it is time to restore some old - fashioned values			1
‘ i was exposed to the gym at about 28 , ’ joked @entity3			1
‘ i never had a huge love or appetite for it — it was just a means to an end			2
i get burnt in the sun , so there ’s no point me getting pecs for when i take my shirt off in the summer			2
@entity43 thinks there is too much emphasis for younger players on to do well in the gym the @entity49 rugby legend fears that learning the finer arts of the game is second behind performing in the gym ‘ in more recent years i got into it because it was a necessary evil			1
you have to get a passion for it , but i do n’t just know if that balance is there at the moment			2
‘ i never loved doing weights the way these young guys do			2
their technique is phenomenal but it ’s as if they ’re winning if they have great scores in the gym			1
‘ i ’m not privy to the @entity70 set - up but at the academies in @entity30 there is a huge focus on the weights room , as opposed to whether they can throw a 10 - metre pass on the run			1
they should be rugby players becoming athletes , not athletes becoming rugby players			1
’ the team culture in @entity70 rugby encourages players to strive to be top of the charts in the players ’ room			1
it becomes a machismo contest to see who has the highest one - rep maximum on the bench - press or the @entity94 squat			2
@entity43 retired from international rugby earlier in 2014 after helping @entity30 win the @entity96 the 35 - year - old has been working as a pundit for @entity99 and will do so for the upcoming @entity96 size matters , but amid a growing chorus of concern , @entity3 believes the obsession is only serving to widen the gulf in class between northern and southern hemisphere teams — with the @entity107 setting the standard			1
‘ i do n’t think the gym monkey thing applies to them as much as it does over here , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ they have farmer strength			2
the @entity114 guys are pretty strong without going to the gym			1
‘ in @entity107 , they focus way more from an early age on skills			1
they do everything with a ball			2
they do all their fitness work with a ball and that ’s why they have better skill levels			2
they have the balance ; they have that physicality but they are able to mix their game up			0
’ with a strong @entity136 core , many of the @entity107 are blessed with natural strength — @entity138 and @entity139 are both of @entity141 descent			1
@entity43 backs @entity107 to retain their crown and win the @entity144 in @entity145 @entity145 suffered defeats by both @entity147 and @entity107 at @entity148 in the autumn internationals @entity43 at a rugby event in @entity151 a clean sweep of victories on their @entity155 tour was rewarded with a new deal for coach @entity157 and the @entity158 reinforced their position as favourites to win next year ’s @entity161			1
@entity145 and @entity162 both failed to shoot down the world champions , but focus now turns towards the @entity96 , which kicks off on february 6			0
@entity3 ’s involvement will be as a pundit			0
he missed just one @entity96 campaign between 1999 and 2014 , so it is natural that he still has the occasional pang to be involved			0
@entity30 were expected to struggle after their talisman ’s retirement but fared best out of the home nations during the autumn internationals			1
@entity3 says that @entity107 will win the @entity161 , but he is not so decisive when asked about his country ’s credentials to win the @entity175			1
‘ @entity30 are the form team and @entity145 look as though they took a step back in november , ’ he said			1
‘ i think it will be the most open @entity96 for years — but i ca n’t see anyone winning the @entity175			0
i do n’t think @entity179 has been able to pair up people he would have liked to , particularly with @entity181 being injured			0
you would imagine that he ’ll now back @entity183 at fly - half going into the @entity96			0
‘ i think a really good foil for @entity186 would be @entity187 and @entity181			0
i think they could complement each other really well			0
i also really like @entity190 and @entity191 — who can play plenty for a big man — but i ’d probably go with @entity187			0
’ the former centre thinks @entity30 are the form team heading into the @entity96 in february @entity145 ’s midfield puzzle remains unsolved			1
the @entity197 provided more questions than answers and @entity181 is being heralded as the solution to @entity202 ’s soft centre			2
like the @entity205 , the @entity204 man also has roots in the @entity136			0
he is @entity145 ’s most naturally powerful player and has the potential to spark huge collisions in the contact area			0
@entity3 , a healthy - lifestyle ambassador for @entity210 , would never shirk a tackle on a player such as @entity181 , but admits he is concerned about the long - term impact of the ever - increasing physicality			0
last season ’s @entity145 under 18 side were , man for man , heavier than the senior @entity145 side who reached the 1991 @entity161 final			1
this has a direct impact on the risks of concussion and @entity3 ’s family have been at the forefront in raising awareness of head injuries			0
@entity43 took part in a surprise rugby session with teens in east @entity151 ahead of the @entity161 ‘ it was not something we sat and talked about over sunday dinner , ’ said @entity3 , who suffered a series of concussions as a player			1
‘ there have always been head injuries in the game			0
the impacts are getting bigger , but we are more aware of concussion these days			0
‘ it ’s not a cool thing to play on with a head knock any more			0
it is not manly , it is not heroic ; it is just stupid			0
‘ we ’re guinea pigs from the physicality in the game , not from a concussion point of view but how our joints are going to be when we are in our 40s and 50s after the impacts we are taking			0
you see guys from the amateur era having knee and hip replacements at 45 and 50			0
‘ having said that , i think we are physically considerably fitter than they were in the amateur era so our bodies are more toned to take that level of impact , at least i would be hopeful that that ’s the case			0
’ @entity3 was taking part in a surprise rugby session with teens in east @entity151 to launch the official partnership between @entity210 and @entity161 2015			1
@entity210 looks forward to celebrating the passion and excitement of the tournament to bring fans together and inspire people to move more			0
