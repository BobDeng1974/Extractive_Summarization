by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 customer grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges			1
the man , who declined to give his real name but calls himself ‘ @entity13 ’ online , posted his exchanges on @entity15 on sunday and claims the company only refunded him $ 182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges			1
the incident came about after @entity13 moved to a new apartment in @entity22 , @entity23 , a month ago and installed his modem and set up his @entity25 himself			0
something which had never been an issue not long after , his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called @entity3 to complain			0
together , @entity13 and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it was n't his fault			2
based on his previous experience with the cable company , @entity13 asked the representative to confirm would n't be charged for the repair			1
this assurance was captured on tape			0
a @entity3 technician then visited the building where @entity13 lives and fixed the problem			1
the problem started when @entity13 checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $ 132 for failing to install his modem properly			2
something which had never been an issue			0
on top of that , @entity13 was also he was charged another $ 50 for having @entity3 set up his @entity25 - again something that @entity13 had already done himself			1
when he called @entity3 to query the charges , @entity13 was put on hold for an hour before he hung up			1
eventually he spoke with a rep called @entity59 who informed him that @entity3 had subtracted $ 100 from his bill for ' service discounts			1
' despite his bill being more than halved , @entity13 said he was still unhappy about the charges			0
next , he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service			0
the offer was worth less than the $ 82 that @entity3 was still asking @entity13 to pay and so he said no. next , @entity59 told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account			1
@entity13 then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which @entity3 told him he would n't be charged			1
finally , @entity3 backed down and gave him back his money			2
' why were you not able to do that before ? ' @entity13 asked			0
when @entity13 spoke to a rep at @entity3 he was told him that there was simply no way they could remove the charges or reimburse his account ( stock image of @entity3 call center ) taking the blame : an internal memo from @entity3 coo @entity85 blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics ' again , that is a valid charge , ' @entity59 said			1
' but since i advised my manager that there is a recording , and you were misinformed , then he 's the one who can approve that $ 82			0
' ' you 're telling me that if i did n't have a recording of that call , you would n't have been able to do it , ' he said			0
' that is correct , yes			0
' @entity13 , who works as a senior it analyst for a large company , posted about his experience with @entity3 on @entity103 and received a deluge of people with similar experiences			1
last month , @entity3 made headlines after another customer recorded and published a phone call with customer service			1
in that call , a @entity3 rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to switch cable and @entity117 providers			2
a leaked memo reveals that high - ranking executives at @entity3 admit the excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly their fault			2
the company 's chief operating officer @entity85 says in his memo that the nagging , begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by @entity125 was part of what @entity3 paid and trained the employee to do			2
' it was painful to listen to this call , and i am not surprised that we have been criticized for it , ' @entity85 says in the document first leaked to @entity135			0
the memo surfaced just a week after the call to @entity138 founder @entity125 -- who recorded it and put it on @entity141 , where it 's now been played over 5 million times -- went viral			0
' we are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to the customer ’s desire to discontinue service , ' @entity85 wrote			0
@entity3 is currently seeking regulatory approval to buy @entity152 for $ 45 billion , a deal that would make the largest cable company in the world even bigger			1
critics of the deal argue that a telecom so large would have even less reason to offer decent customer service .			0
