@entity0 was awarded the @entity1 and was beatified by the @entity2 in 2003 researchers are calling into question the saintly image of @entity0 after carrying out research into her life			1
born @entity10 in @entity11 , she founded the @entity12 and spent much of her life in @entity14 , caring for the sick and poor			1
she was awarded the @entity1 and was beatified by the @entity2 in 2003 , six years after her death - one miracle away from sainthood			0
but a number of critics have questioned how much of the image is justified			1
writing in journal studies in religion / sciences , @entity22 and @entity23 , say her hallowed reputation does not stand up to scrutiny			0
prof @entity22 said : ' while looking for documentation on the phenomenon of altruism for a seminar on ethics , one of us stumbled upon the life and work of one of @entity38 's most celebrated woman and now part of our collective imagination - @entity0			1
' the description was so ecstatic that it piqued our curiosity and pushed us to research further			0
' after studying nearly 300 documents on her life , they concluded that a number of issues surrounded the nun were not taken into account by the @entity2			0
these included ' her rather dubious way of caring for the sick , her questionable political contacts , her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received , and her overly dogmatic views regarding , in particular , abortion , contraception , and divorce			2
' at the time of her death , @entity0 had opened 517 missions welcoming the poor and sick in more than 100 countries			1
but these missions have been described as ' homes for the dying ' by doctors visiting several of these establishments in @entity14			2
doctors observed a significant lack of hygiene , even unfit conditions , as well as a shortage of actual care , inadequate food , and no painkillers			0
but the authors say the problem is not a lack of money , as the foundation created by @entity0 has raised hundred of millions of pounds			2
sisters of the @entity87 attend the state funeral for @entity0 in @entity14 but critics have sparked controversy claiming her care of the sick was ' dubious ' they also say that following numerous natural disasters in @entity95 she offered prayers and medallions of the @entity98 but no direct or monetary aid			1
but she accepted the @entity100 and a grant from the @entity103 dictatorship in @entity104 , said prof @entity105 , and although millions of dollars were transferred to the various bank accounts , most of the accounts were kept secret			0
dr @entity22 says : ' given the parsimonious management of @entity0 's works , one may ask where the millions of dollars for the poorest of the poor have gone ? ' he says that her image may have been built upon a meeting in 1968 with the @entity116 's @entity115 , an anti-abortion journalist who shared her right - wing catholic values			1
it was his promotion of her which led to her fame , they say			0
but whether or not her image is deserved , the authors accept that there are many positives to her reputation			0
dr @entity22 said : ' if the extraordinary image of @entity0 conveyed in the collective imagination has encouraged humanitarian initiatives that are genuinely engaged with those crushed by poverty , we can only rejoice			1
' it is likely that she has inspired many humanitarian workers whose actions have truly relieved the suffering of the destitute and addressed the causes of poverty and isolation without being extolled by the media			0
' nevertheless , the media coverage of @entity0 could have been a little more rigorous			2

@entity0 founded the @entity12 and spent much of her life caring for the sick and poor in @entity14
but researchers are questioning whether her image is justified
