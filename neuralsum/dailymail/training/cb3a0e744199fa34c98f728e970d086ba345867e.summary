@entity2 people ' packed ' the base of the @entity5 monolith with smaller stones and angled it precisely using the altitude of the sun. the researchers believe the stone was put there for symbolic reasons , and angled precisely to catch light through the changing seasons			1
at midsummer , the stone would ' light up ' - but in winter , it would be permanently shadowed			2
a similar cycle is used at other burial sites to symbolise eternity , the researchers say			1
the people who raised the stone would have just switched from a hunter - gatherer lifestyle to primitive farming			0
researchers carried out a detailed ' microtopography ' survey of the ground around the monolith , and believe that stones were carefully packed aroun the stone			2
a 3d model of how light strikes the monolith - adjusted for changes in @entity39 's tilt over four millennia - shows that the stone was very precisely angled to catch the sun. the orientation and inclination of the slope is aligned to the altitude of the @entity47 at mid-summer			2
the @entity49 researchers believe that the monolith was set in place to give symbolic meaning to the location through the changing seasons			0
the landscape surrounding the stone harbors many ancient monuments such as @entity59 roundhouses , a late @entity2 enclosure , and other traces of a long lasting human occupation			1
‘ given the sensitivity of the site , we ca n’t probe under the surface of the soil			2
however , through our survey , we have found a higher density of packing stones on one side , supporting the case that the stone has been orientated intentionally , ’ said dr. @entity63			1
a 3d model of the stone - adjusted for the change in @entity39 's tilt over four millennia - showed how it would have caught the light on @entity80 's day and remained in darkness through winter the researchers showed how the stone was carefully angled to catch the sun at certain seasons the 3 - d modeling shows that during the winter half - year , the slanted side of the stone would remain in permanent shadow ; during most of the summer half - year it would only be illuminated during the morning and afternoon ; close to midsummer it would be illuminated all day			1
the researchers are currently backing up the modeling work by gathering contemporary photographic evidence of the stone			0
‘ the stone would have been an ideal marker for a social arena for seasonal gatherings , ’ said dr. @entity63			0
‘ it ’s not a sundial in the sense that people would have used it to determine an exact time			0
we think that it was set in position to give a symbolic meaning to its location , a bit like the way that some religious buildings are aligned in a specific direction for symbolic reasons			0
’ the researchers hope that the new evidence will support the case for a wider archaeological survey of the site			0
‘ the use of shadow casting in monuments of this period is quite rare in the @entity122 , ’ said dr. @entity63			0
‘ but there are some examples including @entity125 , @entity126 , and some @entity127 in the north - east of @entity129 that have been proposed to include the intentional use of shadows			0
' both are associated to burial sites using the symbolism of a cyclic light and shadow display to represent eternity			1
given the proximity of the @entity2 enclosure and possible ritual importance of this site , the @entity139 monolith could be another such example			1

@entity146 was angled using ' packing stones ' at base
would have ' lit up ' at midsummer
could have been used to symbolise eternity at pagan burial site
@entity2 remains around the site
