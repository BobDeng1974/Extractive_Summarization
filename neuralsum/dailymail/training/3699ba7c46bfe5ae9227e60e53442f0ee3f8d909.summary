@entity0 has said there are ' billions ' of planets in our own @entity4 galaxy - but a new study suggests that the idea that they are teeming with alien lifeforms may just be wishful thinking			1
two @entity12 scientists used what 's known as ' bayesian analysis ' - a technque that ' boils down ' ideas to the actual data , as opposed to scientists ' own ideas about what ' should ' be true			1
they suggest that it 's very possible @entity24 is a one - off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet , the chances of life are very low indeed			1
the @entity4 : it contains 100 billion planets , but scientists suggest that it 's very possible @entity24 is a one - off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet , the chances of life are very low indeed science fiction ? @entity12 scientists suggest that the idea of extraterrestrial life - as in @entity40 's @entity39 - is just fiction , and @entity24 's early evolution of life might just be a ' fluke ' ‘ @entity48 evidence suggests that life began very early in @entity24 's history and that has led people to determine that life might be quite common in the universe because it happened so quickly here , but the knowledge about life on @entity24 simply does n't reveal much about the actual probability of life on other planets , ’ said @entity12 astrophysical sciences professor @entity45 and @entity46 , a former @entity12 postdoctoral researcher			1
‘ information about that probability comes largely from the assumptions scientists have going in , and some of the most optimistic conclusions have been based almost entirely on those assumptions , ’ he said			0
‘ if scientists start out assuming that the chances of life existing on another planet as it does on @entity24 are large , then their results will be presented in a way that supports that likelihood , ’ @entity45 said			2
‘ our work is not a judgment , but an analysis of existing data that suggests the debate about the existence of life on other planets is framed largely by the prior assumptions of the participants			0
’ @entity85 , an associate professor of physics at the @entity87 , said that @entity45 and @entity88 cast convincing doubt on the basis for expecting extraterrestrial life			2
@entity85 , who focuses his research on the properties of exoplanets , is familiar with the research but had no role in it			0
‘ there is a commonly heard argument that life must be common or else it would not have arisen so quickly after the surface of the @entity24 cooled , ’ @entity85 said			0
‘ this argument seems persuasive on its face , but @entity88 and @entity45 have shown it does n't stand up to a rigorous statistical examination — with a sample of only one life - bearing planet , one can not even get a ballpark estimate of the abundance of life in the universe			0
the @entity12 scientists suggest that it 's likely that @entity24 is a one - off - and that life may not have evolved anywhere else one of the recent ' earth - like ' planets discovered by @entity0 - but a new @entity12 study suggests that @entity24 alone may play host to life the emergence of life on @entity24 gave reasons to be optimistic about the search for life elsewhere , ’ @entity85 said			1
‘ now i 'm not so sure , though i think scientists should still search for life on other planets to the extent we can			0
’ deep - space satellites and telescope projects have recently identified various planets that resemble @entity24 in their size and composition , and are within their star 's habitable zone , the optimal distance for having liquid water			2
of particular excitement have been the discoveries of @entity0 's @entity139 , a satellite built to find @entity24 - like planets around other stars			1
while these observations tend to stoke the expectation of finding @entity24 - like life , they do not actually provide evidence that it does or does not exist , @entity46 explained			1
instead , these planets have our knowledge of life on @entity24 projected onto them , he said			0
yet , when what is known about life on @entity24 is taken away , there is no accurate sense of how probable abiogenesis is on any given planet , @entity46 said			0
it was this ‘ prior ignorance , ’ or lack of expectations , that he and @entity45 wanted to account for in their analysis , he said			0
‘ when we use a mathematical prior that truly represents prior ignorance , the data of early life on @entity24 becomes ambiguous , ’ @entity46 said			2
@entity46 and @entity45 also propose that once this planet 's history is considered , the emergence of life on @entity24 might be so distinct that it is a poor barometer of how it occurred elsewhere , regardless of the likelihood that such life exists .			1

analysis suggests idea of extraterrestrial life is ' wishful thinking '
scientists have believed that because life evolved early in @entity24 's history , it must be everywhere
idea is simply *wrong* , say @entity12 scientists
@entity24 could be a one - off aberration and other worlds could be *lifeless*
