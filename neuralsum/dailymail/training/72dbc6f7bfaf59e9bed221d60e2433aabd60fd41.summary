infertile couples from all over the world can browse profiles of the donors , whose faces are clearly visible , to select the characteristics , body types or qualifications			1
the site , premier @entity17 , is run by @entity19 and @entity20 , who made history in 1999 when they became the first gay couple to be named on their surrogate twins ’ birth certificates			2

three months ago , @entity19 , 43 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , merged @entity59 and @entity60			0
some @entity6 women who donated eggs through @entity59 in the past are now on the @entity60 site , which is aimed largely at the @entity54 market			1
in contrast to @entity6 , surrogacy deals in the @entity54 are big business			1
the 12 @entity6 women on the site include a model and a parliamentary researcher			1
several include photographs resembling those found on dating sites			0
one 20 - year - old ’s personal statement says : ‘ i want to give people what i have			2
a beautiful child is the greatest gift			0
’ the @entity82 says that strict laws ban identification of egg donors			1
but in an apparent legal loophole , responsibility for protecting their identity rests with the licensed clinic where the eggs were donated			0
@entity92 , chief executive of the @entity94 charity , said : ‘ the pictures look like sexy poses			0
considering what the website is all about , it ’s very distasteful			0
this is certainly something the @entity82 should look into			2
they ’re not acting within the spirit of the @entity6 guidelines			2
’ family business : the site , premier @entity17 , is run by @entity19 and @entity20 , pictured here at their home near @entity107 , @entity108 , with three of their five children born to @entity54 surrogate mothers in a recent @entity115 interview promoting their business , the @entity113 - @entity112 made no secret of the huge sums to be made in the @entity54 by bringing together infertile couples with donors , surrogates and doctors			1
@entity19 said : ‘ in the @entity6 you can only pay a surrogate up to £ 15,000 in expenses – in the @entity54 , we pay them up to £ 35,000			1
’ for egg donors , the maximum fee for expenses in @entity6 is £ 750 , but in @entity54 they receive £ 16,000 to £ 32,000			1
the @entity59 tells @entity6 women who want to donate eggs in @entity54 that @entity54 rules only allow this if they have previously donated elsewhere			1
@entity59 organises egg donation in this country at approved clinics , then says the women are eligible to donate in the @entity54 and can appear on the @entity60 website			1
under @entity82 rules , the centres where they donate are responsible for ensuring the women ’s identities remain confidential			2
one @entity6 woman in her late 20s who donated eggs a year ago through @entity59 said that while she initially consented to her profile being featured , she had not realised her details were on the @entity54 site until @entity151 told her			1
she had first contacted bsc and was referred for a consultation in @entity154 ’s @entity153			0
‘ i gave them loads of information and a picture , ’ she said			0
a few months later she went to the @entity159 and @entity160 for the donation process			0
women display @entity164 information about their physical appearance and interests			0
the site also uses numbers to identify them @entity169 said both @entity60 and @entity170 are based in @entity171			2
he added : ‘ ninety - five per cent of egg donors on this site are @entity54 and all donors are for couples going through the @entity177 process in the @entity54			1
' the @entity82 does not hold authority in the @entity54			2
if an @entity181 woman wants to advertise as a surrogate – which is also illegal in the @entity6 – or become an egg donor for couples in the @entity54 , she can and will be identified			1
all our procedures are in line with the law			0
’ the @entity82 said : ‘ it is the responsibility of the @entity6 fertility centre , licensed by the @entity82 , to ensure they comply fully with regulatory requirements , such as confidentiality			2
we will be in contact with the centre involved to investigate			0
