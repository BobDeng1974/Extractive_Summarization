they have become a quick and easy way of learning about everything from world affairs to the affairs of friends			0
but @entity6 and @entity7 may be eroding our ability to think			1
researchers believe speed , volume and ease with which information is shared through social networking sites may be making it more difficult for us to think analytically			2
is @entity6 making us less intelligent ? new research suggests we prefer to seek answers from the masses rather than work things out for ourselves the computing expert studied how being part of a network of people affects how we learn			1
dr @entity24 began by asking a group of 20 people three trick questions over and over again			1
for example they were told that and bat and ball cost £ 1.10 in total and that the bat cost £ 1 more than the ball , and then they were asked to work out how much the ball costs			2
the intuitive answer is 10p but the correct answer is actually 5p			0
despite being repeatedly asked the questions , people tended to stick with their original answers and only got them correct around a quarter of the time			1
the study asked volunteers to work out the cost of a bat and ball if together they cost £ 1.10 but the bat was £ 1 more expensive than the ball			2
dr @entity24 says social networks our destroying our ability to think analytically and answer ' taxing ' questions like this dr @entity24 then gave the same questions to a second group of people			1
they first answered the questions alone but then were put in groups and able to see each other ’s responses			0
given the first question , the men and women quickly realised when someone else in their social network had the right answer and changed theirs accordingly			0
however , they did no better initially on the second question , or the third			0
a recent study suggests nearly half of all 16 to 19 - year - olds log onto @entity7 every month			1
26 percent of teenagers in the same age bracket use @entity6 every month says market research firm @entity77			2
but 25 to 34 - year - olds make up the largest share of users across all social network according to the study @entity7 and @entity6 usage actually increased in 2013			1
and there seems to be no end in sight , with new social networks continuing to pull in more users			2
this surprised dr @entity24 , who said it suggests that the volunteers were copying the answers without putting any real thought into what they were doing			1
by not computing that they should n’t rush in with their first answer but take time to think the question over , they fell into the same trap each time			0
dr @entity24 , who is based at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , said : ‘ we think people are unwilling to reflect more because it takes time and effort and in daily life we do n’t have the luxury of time to verify everything			1
’ he said that while we have long learned from others , there is a danger that the rise of information - sharing websites such as @entity6 and @entity7 will make us rely more and more on the opinion of others			2
this could erode our ability to think critically and make us lazy because we assume that there will always be someone else who knows the answer			0
and while much of the information we glean will be helpful , there is a chance we will believe dangerous advice			0
finally , while we may seem smarter because we have lots of information at our fingertips , any boost to intelligence is purely superficial , the @entity130 reports			0
the researcher , who has a @entity7 account but has n’t used it for months , advises that we take more time to stop and think for ourselves and that we carry out detailed research on important topics			1
dr @entity24 has focused on @entity6 and @entity7 because , like his study , they involve information being shared through networks of people			1
but previous research has blamed internet search engines such as @entity146 for making it harder for us to remember facts			0
a study published in the journal @entity151 found that we are more likely to forget things if we think we can find them again online			0
we are also better at remembering where to look for something on the internet than we are at storing the information itself .			0

@entity6 and @entity7 could be *lowering* your ability to think analytically
research from dr @entity24 suggests *prolonged* use of social networks erodes our common sense
the @entity170 and @entity101 researcher asked people a series of trick questions
the study concluded that our *addiction* to social networks leaves us little time to work things out on our own
