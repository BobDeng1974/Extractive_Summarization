the airships which terrorised the home front gave rise to the slang ‘ zeppelins in a cloud ’ for bangers and mash , which fell out of use soon after the war			2

' by studying the vocabulary we can build up a more accurate picture of what was going on in the war			0
' the phrase ‘ zeppelins in a cloud ’ we first saw in a dictionary of @entity12 slang , first published in 1925 , but we are sure we will be able to find an earlier reference to it			1
