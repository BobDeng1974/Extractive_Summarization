a group of intrepid archaeologists are excavating a 5,000 year old ancient site on the @entity5 - @entity4 border within sight of the black flag of @entity8			1
the @entity10 researchers are digging in the ancient city of @entity12 , which is close to the @entity4 city of @entity14 - which is under the control of the feared terrorist organisation			1
archaeology professor @entity17 , of the @entity18 said his team has been working as @entity20 and coalition aircraft screamed overhead on their way to targeting the @entity24 extremists			0
prof @entity17 said the site of @entity26 is just 20 metres from @entity8 controlled territory in @entity4 his team have been working within sight of the black flag of @entity8 which flies over the @entity4 side of the border prof @entity17 said he hoped the area could be opened up for tourists by next spring - despite the neighbours @entity5 troops allowed the researchers back onto the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years			1
he said : ' basically we work 20 meters away from the @entity40 - controlled areas			0
' due to the sensitive nature of the location , the area is guarded by more than 500 @entity5 soldiers , tanks and it is covered by artillery			1
he said : ' still , we have had no problem at all			0
... we work in a military area			0
it is very well protected			0
' the project , which also includes archaeologists from @entity54 and @entity55 universities , is doing the most extensive excavations at @entity12 in nearly a century , building on the work of @entity59 teams that included @entity60 , the adventurer known as @entity60			1
@entity17 said the plan is to open the site to tourists next spring			2
a concrete barrier , about four meters high , will be installed at the site			2
he said : ' this will be a total protection for the tourists			0
' the strategic city , its importance long known to scholars because of references in ancient texts , was under the sway of @entity76 and other imperial rulers and independent kings			2
@entity5 authorities allowed researchers access the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years almost a century ago , @entity60 spent time excavating the historically important site in @entity5 unfortunately , tourists wo n't be able to access approximately one - third of the site as it is across the border however , archaeological investigation there was halted by @entity90 it was stopped again by hostilities between @entity5 nationalists and @entity95 colonizers from @entity4 who built machine gun nests in its defensive walls			1
part of the area was mined in the 1950s , and in later years , creating deadly obstacles to excavation			0
@entity103 was completed just a few years ago			1
archaeologists are completing their fourth season unearthing the secrets of @entity12 along the @entity107			2
the archaeological site is just a few yards from the @entity4 border which is under the control of @entity8 the area is being guarded by more than 500 @entity5 troops , tanks and artillery to prevent @entity8 incursions before the archaeologists could begin their work , the entire area had to be de-mined the name @entity12 means ' @entity121 of ( the god ) @entity122 , ' a deity at the time in northern @entity4			1
stone monuments decorated with sculptures , hieroglyphics and more than 20 meter - high city walls attest to the influence of the town			1
among this year 's finds were sculptures in the palace of @entity134 , who ruled the area around 900 b.c. there were five large orthostats in limestone and basalt , a dark grey to black rock , that portray row of individuals bearing gifts of gazelle			0
an orthostate is an upright stone or slab that forms part of a structure			0
the archaeologists also found a mosaic floor in the palace of @entity154 , who reigned around 700 b.c. over @entity155 , an ancient empire mostly located in @entity157			0
and the team finished exploration of the ruins of the expedition house of @entity60 , who worked at @entity12 between 1911 and 1914			2
the team began its project in 2011 around the time that the @entity4 uprising against president @entity165 was escalating			0
about one - third of the 90 - hectare ( 222 - acre ) archaeological site lies inside @entity4 and is therefore off - limits ; construction and farming in @entity14 have encroached on what was the outer edge of the ancient city			1
most discoveries have been made on the @entity5 side			0
among the artifacts uncovered at the site is this @entity177 statue which now at the entrance of a museum despite the danger posed by the @entity8 fanatics just a few metres away , archaeologists continued their work among the artifacts recovered from the site is this bath and a pair of ancient jugs intriguingly , the artifacts recovered represent a number of different civilisations who all spent time in the area the area around the ancient city had been off - limits to archaeologists for more than 90 years archaeologists had to wait for a mine field to be cleared before they could access the site and begin work unfortunately , a quarter of the ancient city is off - limits as it is on the wrong side of the border			1

*reseachers* have uncovered ancient monuments just 20 metres from @entity8
archaeologists have been digging at the site on the @entity5 / @entity4 border
the 5,000 year old ancient city of @entity12 will open to tourists next year
the area is protected from @entity8 by 500 soldiers , tanks and even artillery
before the tourists arrive , a 4 metre high safety barrier will be built
the area was first examined by @entity60 almost 100 years ago
