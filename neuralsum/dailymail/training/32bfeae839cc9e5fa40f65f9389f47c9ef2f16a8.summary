a drought - stricken lake in @entity2 has turned up a surprising discovery - the gun and badge of a federal agent which was accidentally dropped overboard more than two decades ago			1
the backpack was spotted by a fisherman at @entity9 in north @entity10 , @entity2 on thursday			1
the water level has dropped almost 50 per cent to 151 feet , leading the gun and badge to be easily retrieved from once deep water			0
' a watch and mini-calendar from 1992 were also found in the backpack			2
the deputies were able to find the agent who works for the @entity32			0
the agent revealed that he had been on the lake one day in 1992 and dropped his bag over the side of a boat , adding that he had gotten into trouble for the mistake			0
@entity2 is suffering its worst drought since 1895 , when records began			1
combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions , the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state			0
a recent report estimated that the water shortage would result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $ 2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part - time jobs in 2014 alone			0
such impacts prompted @entity2 governor @entity57 to declare a drought emergency and the federal government to designate all 58 @entity2 counties as natural disaster areas			1
@entity9 , pictured in may 2014 , reveals that the water had started receding slightly from the shoreline @entity9 , pictured four months later in september 2014 , showing the dramatic effects of the state 's drought with water levels dropping close to 50 per cent researchers last month found that @entity2 's unprecedented drought is ' very likely ' linked to human - caused climate change			1
they say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the @entity73 that diverted storms away from @entity2 was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations			2
it is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and @entity2 's ongoing drought			1
scientists also determined that as long as high levels of greenhouse gases remain , severe droughts could become more frequent			0
' @entity2 is more likely to see these episodes in the near term , ' said environmental scientist @entity89 , who led the study			2
despite the findings , @entity91 , principal scientist at @entity93 's @entity92 and one of the report 's editors , said it is still hard to definitively link rainfall to climate change			0
a recent drought - monitor map from @entity2 shows that most of the state remains in the emergency ' red zone ' this month			2
