eating nuts and peanuts reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke , a new study claims			1
researchers found they were linked with a reduced risk of death from heart disease among people on low incomes			2
and they believe their findings suggest peanuts may be a cost - effective measure to improve cardiovascular health because they are so cheap			1
however experts cautioned today that salt - covered nuts would not have the same health benefits			1
the new study , led by dr @entity33 , of the @entity34 , @entity35 , analysed various groups of people			0
one involved 72,000 low - income black and white men and women living in the @entity41 , the other 134,000 men and women living in @entity44 , @entity45			0
in both groups , men ate more peanuts than women			0
in the @entity41 group , about half of the nuts consumed were peanuts , and in the @entity45 group only peanut consumption was assessed			2
@entity55 , @entity56 at @entity57 , said : ' research over the past few years has shown heart - health benefits of including nuts and legumes ( like peanuts ) as part of a varied diet			1
' this is probably because nuts and peanuts contribute a valuable source of protein , dietary fibres , healthy fats , vitamins @entity72 , @entity74 , folic acid , vitamin e , magnesium and zinc to the diet			0
although almost half the weight of a peanut is fat ( 48 % ) , the majority is of the heart - healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated types			0
studies where nuts have been added to the diet ( such as the @entity90 @entity89 study ) , and long - term population studies have consistently shown a reduction in death from heart disease when nuts and legumes are included in the diet			1
the researchers found that across the board , eating nuts reduced the risk of death from heart disease			2
this was regardless of gender , race , @entity105 , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity			1
in the @entity41 , the highest consumption resulted in a risk reduction of 21 per cent			0
in the @entity45 group , it was 17 per cent			0
dr @entity33 said : ' we observed no significant associations between nut or peanut consumption and risk of death due to cancer and diabetes			0
' she added the findings highlight the large public health impact of nut or peanut consumption in lowering deaths from heart disease - especially given their affordability			2
the research was published in @entity134			0
dr @entity135 , deputy editor of the journal , added : ' of course , peanuts are not really nuts - they are legumes since they grow in bushes , unlike tree nuts			2
nuts reduced the risk of death regardless of gender , race , @entity105 , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity ' but who cares if they help us to live longer at an affordable price ? ' however experts have cautioned that people should not start eating ' large quantities ' of nuts and peanuts in light of the research			1
commenting on the findings , professor @entity162 , medical director at the @entity163 , said : ' this large study found that death rates from heart attacks were lower in people who eat nuts , particularly peanuts , than in those who do n't			1
' however , the data do not show that the more peanuts you eat the lower the risk of a fatal heart attack , so people should not start eating large quantities of nuts , particularly salted nuts , in the hope that it will protect them from heart disease			1
' the results suggest that including a modest amount of nuts as part of a well - balanced diet may be of benefit			0

peanuts may be a ' cost - effective measure to improve heart health '
not only are they cheap , they are *readily* available , researchers point out
findings held regardless of gender , race , @entity105 and other health conditions
but eating salted nuts does not count , say experts commenting on study
