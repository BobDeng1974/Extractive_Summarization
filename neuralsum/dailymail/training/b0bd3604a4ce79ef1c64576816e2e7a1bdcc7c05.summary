the colour and weight of your cutlery will have a major influence on what they think of your cooking , according to a study by @entity17 academics			1
lead researcher @entity18 said : ‘ subtly changing eating implements and tableware can affect how pleasurable or filling food appears			2
’ eating yoghurt with a light plastic spoon made eating a more luxurious experience , giving the food a dense and expensive taste and texture cheese seemed saltier when eaten from a knife instead of a fork or toothpick			1
@entity31 appeared denser and more expensive when served from a light plastic spoon			1
when tested with coloured cutlery , volunteers rated white yoghurt as sweeter and more pricey than pink when eaten from a white spoon			1
but if a black spoon was used , the pink variety was rated as better			0
cheese appears saltier when eaten with a knife according to the new research meanwhile , a blue spoon made pink yoghurt taste significantly saltier than white			1
the report in journal flavour suggests that we have an ‘ emotional response to colour ’ and experience builds up associations with a colour or food			2
miss @entity18 added : ‘ the colour of the food appears different depending on the background on which it is presented ( plate or cutlery ) and , therefore , tastes different			2
’ psychologist @entity59 , who co-wrote the report , advised avoiding red as this has been shown to cut people ’s appetite			0
he added that an easy way to make a good impression is to use heavy cutlery			0
‘ @entity68 weight is associated with better food , and they will subconsciously think you are serving them the best , ’ said professor @entity59			0
a previous study showed that drinks in glasses tinted with cold colours , such as blue or green , were rated more refreshing .			0

size , weight , shape and colour of tools we use to eat changes how it tastes
