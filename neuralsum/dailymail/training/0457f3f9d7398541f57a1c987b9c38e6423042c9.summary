@entity1 rep. @entity0 - aka the kissing congressman - wo n't be on the ballot this fall , but that does n't mean he wo n't seek elected office ever again			1
' no , i would n’t rule it out , ' @entity0 told @entity8 on wednesday			2
' i ’d just have to see what ’s right for me and my family at the time			0
… for future politics , i do n’t know what it holds , but if there ’s a possibility that the people want me to do another political office , again , maybe i ’ll do it			1
' @entity20 @entity1 @entity0 , left , says he 's not quitting his job , even though he got caught cheating on his wife @entity22 , right , because she does n't want him to video of the congressman and his scheduler smooching in his @entity27 office created headaches for the congressman and the aide , @entity31 , after a local news station aired their dirty laundry @entity0 , a married father of five , was infamously caught on camera kissing his scheduler , who is also married , just months after he was elected			1
the @entity20 businessman was swept into office in a special election to replace rep. @entity40 after the latter left vacatred his seat to go work for @entity44 governor @entity44			1
video of the two smooching in @entity0 's @entity27 office created headaches for the congressman and the aide , @entity31 , after a local news station aired the @entity29 's dirty laundry			1
@entity0 said he now knows the leak came from within and the staffer responsible no longer works for him			2
he 's not telling reporters the person 's name , though			0
' i do n’t want to bring anyone else down , ' @entity0 told @entity59 , @entity20 , news station @entity61 / @entity60 this week			1
local media have speculated the @entity29 's @entity59 district office director @entity63 was the culprit because she submitted her resignation amid the scandal , and @entity0 's description of the leaker all but confirmed it was @entity69			1
@entity0 poses for a photo with @entity72 star @entity71 and @entity71 's wife @entity73 ahead of @entity0 's ahead of the president 's @entity76 in january prior to his affair , @entity0 's claim to fame was that he had received the endorsement of @entity72 star @entity71			1
when the scandal broke , @entity0 says @entity71 told him to ' put politics in the back seat and take care of your family first			1
' ' we ’re you ’re friends and we still love you , ' @entity71 reportedly said			0
fellow philandering @entity20 politician @entity90 also stuck by him when things turned south			0
' we talked a couple times by phone and through text message and [ his message ] was just support : like , " keep your head up , " " thinking about you and your family , ’ " " ‘ i know times are tough , " that kind of stuff … that this is not the @entity99 , ' @entity0 told @entity8			0
other political players were not as kind			0
governor @entity44 , @entity103 majority leader @entity102 and the @entity104 vocally called on @entity0 to resign			1
@entity0 told @entity61 / @entity60 that the same @entity20 politicians calling on him to quit never had his back - even before the scandal - ' so that 's really no big surprise and shocker			1
' as for @entity103 majority leader @entity102 , @entity0 agreed with @entity61 / @entity60 reporter interviewing him that @entity102 was ' maybe a little bit ' out of line in calling for his resignation			0
the two talked in the wake of the scandal soon after @entity0 resumed his duties and returned to @entity118 , @entity0 said			2
at that meeting @entity102 again called for his resignation , but ' it was more as a friend to friend			0
' ' there 's no ill will between me and @entity102 , ' @entity0 said ' it is what it is , and we 'll be fine , and we 've got a job to do , so we 'll move on from there			2
' maybe one day : @entity0 has no plans to run for @entity133 again , but says , ' i ¿ d never rule anything out , to be honest with you , whether it be the small of volunteer status for a community organization or national politics , who knows ? ' upon returning to @entity142 said he would not step down because he did n't want to leave his district unrepresented in @entity133 in the interim			2
he still stands by that decision			0
' they did n't elect me to quit , ' @entity0 said			2
a major factor in his refusal to resign is that his wife told him not to , @entity0 said			1
@entity0 says his wife @entity22 told him he ' was n't a quitter ' and ' that 's not what the people want			1
' she understands the importance of his work , he said , ' and that 's what it 's all about			0
'' it 's not about this glitz and glamour , and showing up to this event and being in the newspaper , which @entity164 knows i 've had my fair share of that lately , ' he said			0
if @entity0 ever did run for office again , it probably would n't be @entity133			1
it would be ' something more local , or maybe statewide to be able to help @entity20 , ' he said			0
' i ’d never rule anything out , to be honest with you , whether it be the small of volunteer status for a community organization or national politics , who knows ? ' he added			0
the filing deadline for @entity0 's congressional race is not until august			1
he could still change his mind about quitting his re-election race , too			0
but @entity0 says a political campaign is not in the cards at this time			2
' for this race , i ’m not a candidate , ' @entity0 told @entity8			0
' i have to think of my family			0
