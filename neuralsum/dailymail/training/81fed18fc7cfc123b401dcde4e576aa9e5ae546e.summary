read @entity1 's match report from @entity2 @entity3 is confident @entity4 will make home advantage pay and reach the @entity7 knockout stage			1
@entity4 had a frustrating wednesday night in @entity2 after they were held to a 2 - 2 - draw by @entity9			1
but they are still in control of their destiny and will progress from @entity13 by beating @entity14 on december 9 , even though they were pegged back by @entity16 's late header			1
@entity3 gives @entity4 's @entity7 verdict the thumbs up @entity20 's early blunder gifted @entity21 the opening goal inside three minutes the game started in the worst possible manner for @entity3 , after @entity21 was gifted a third minute opener by @entity20 's error			1
@entity4 , however , responded with goals from @entity28 and @entity29			1
it now becomes a question of whether @entity4 can hold their nerve and see off @entity14 , who were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity34			1
@entity3 , though , has no concerns and insists he would have been happy to be in this position when the group stages started in september			1
@entity3 said : ' we are very frustrated but we needed to come and put on performance to encourage us going forward and one that gave us chance of qualifying from group and had both of them			2
@entity28 hauled @entity4 level in @entity2 as the @entity46 were forced to settle for a point in @entity2 @entity29 celebrates after putting the visitors ahead before @entity9 hit back late on ' the reaction to going behind was fantastic and we showed real character			1
we fell behind to team that 's done really well here			2
' but we showed spirit with the quality of goals			2
of course , we are frustrated at the end because we had defended so well			2
we could have been two or three in front but we have come away with a point			2
' @entity34 beat @entity14 and i said at start it could come down to the last game			1
to have the last game at @entity61 , needing to win to go through , i would have taken that			2
' @entity3 refused to point the blame at @entity20 , who had been earlier been criticised by former @entity4 keeper @entity64			1
@entity3 has refused to blame @entity20 , despite his mistake that gave @entity4 an uphill task ' hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence , ' said @entity3			1
' it was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating			0
thankfully it did n't cost us overall			0
' the pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers ; it was very bobbly , especially around the box			0
thankfully it did n't cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back			0
' we have n't been consistent enough in our performances and that 's my responsibility			0
but in the @entity7 , we still have it in our hands			0
it was always going to be a close group , @entity14 have experience in the competition			1
@entity28 justified his inclusion in the starting xi with his second goal in as many matches ' but thankfully we have had a good result			0
we would have liked to have won but we ca n't ask for more than having to win your last game at home , which i felt would be the case at the start of the competition			0
' @entity28 vindicated @entity3 ' decision to start him after his goal at @entity108 and the @entity110 international believes this performance was a riposte for the criticism that followed the debacle at @entity108			0
' it was my first start in the @entity7 and it was good to score , ' said @entity28			0
' we are devastated about the goal at the end but it was about the performance today - win , lose or draw - and the performance was better			2
' we have answered some of our critics about sunday against @entity108			0
it was about the win and we almost got it			0
now we have to go for an even better performance on saturday			0
