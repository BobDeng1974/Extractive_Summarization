by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 22:51 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 23:03 est , 2 july 2013 cardinal @entity3 , the archbishop of @entity4 , moved nearly $ 57 million into a cemetery trust fund in 2007 specifically to shield it from lawsuits by victims of clergy sexual abuse cardinal @entity3 , the archbishop of @entity4 , moved nearly $ 57 million into a cemetery trust fund in 2007 specifically to shield it from lawsuits by victims of clergy sexual abuse , according to documents released on monday			1
the documents were released as part of a deal reached in federal bankruptcy court between the archdiocese and victims suing it for fraud			0
victims and their attorneys have accused @entity3 of bankruptcy fraud , pointing to the june 2007 letter in which he told a @entity26 office that moving the cemetery care money into a trust would provide ‘ an improved protection of these funds from any legal claim and liability			1
’ the @entity26 moved swiftly to approve the request , the files show , even though it often took years to remove known abusers from the priesthood			1
in a statement , @entity3 called any suggestion he was trying to shield money from victims an ‘ old and discredited ’ attack			1
@entity42 , chief of staff for current archbishop @entity43 , said the money was always set aside in a separate fund for cemetery care and moving it to a trust just formalized that			2
church law requires bishops to seek @entity26 approval for any property sale or asset transfer in the millions of dollars			2
the correspondence was made public on monday along with thousands of pages of other documents detailing sex abuse by dozens of priests in the archdiocese covering southeastern @entity61			1
@entity3 called any suggestion he was trying to shield money from victims an ' old and discredited ' attack victims have accused the archdiocese of transferring abusive priests to new churches without warning parishioners and covering up their crimes for decades			1
although @entity3 has no direct connection with the abuse , he has long been suspected of helping to protect the @entity73 from its repercussions , particularly during his tenure as the archbishop of @entity77			1
lawyers for the victims said the documents would prove that he transferred $ 130 million from the church ’s books - about $ 55 million in a cemetery account , and $ 75 million in an investment account - to shield the money from abuse victims			2
the documents also show that @entity3 oversaw a plan to pay some abusers to leave the priesthood			1
they included @entity92 , who was convicted of fourth - degree sexual assault in 2000 in a case involving a 17 - year - old			0
at least four other victims later came forward			0
the archdiocese barred @entity92 from ministry and celebrating @entity99 in 2003 , it offered him $ 10,000 if he would voluntarily agree to leave the priesthood and another $ 10,000 when @entity26 officials announced their decision about his future			2
@entity92 took the deal but was not officially defrocked until 2009			0
@entity107 , the attorney representing most of the 575 plaintiffs with sex abuse claims in bankruptcy court , said cases like @entity92 's show that the church put predators before children			1
former priests @entity117 , left , was accused of making advances to students at the @entity120 in the 1980s , and @entity121 , right , repeatedly abused children and showed no remorse he and many victims find it especially heinous that the church paid a priest who had already been convicted of a crime , and they fault @entity3 for that			2
but @entity42 said the archdiocese had adopted the practice of paying priests leaving the priesthood years before @entity3 took over			2
most of the priests were not accused of wrongdoing , and the money helped them transition into their new lives , he said			0
at least three priests accused of sexual abuse received payments when they left the priesthood before @entity3 's arrival , according to the documents			1
six more left under @entity3 , with deals calling for them to receive $ 20,000 each			0
@entity42 said the money covered the men 's health care , but it also got ‘ priests out quicker			0
that 's what victims were asking for			0
’ in 2003 , nearly 40 years after some of the earliest reported abuse took place , @entity4 cardinal @entity3 , who was then archbishop of @entity77 , sought permission to have the priest , @entity121 , officially defrocked			1
the @entity26 office in charge of sex abuse cases , then led by cardinal @entity160 , the future pope @entity160 , took more than a year to formally dismiss @entity121 despite the egregiousness of the priest 's crimes , the @entity26 office in charge of sex abuse cases , then led by cardinal @entity160 , the future pope @entity160 , took more than a year to formally dismiss him			1
the @entity121 case was among at least a half - dozen @entity3 inherited when he took over the archdiocese in 2002 amid the growing clergy abuse scandal			2
it shows some of the difficulty church leaders had in dealing with serial molesters and a church bureaucracy that in many cases sat on pleas for priests ' removal for years			0
another case shows just how difficult it was to get rid of priests who would n't go voluntarily			0
@entity178 was accused of making advances to students at the @entity120 when he was in campus ministry in the 1980s			0
@entity182 tried in the 1990s to get @entity117 to voluntarily leave the priesthood , but @entity117 refused			0
in 2005 , as settlements with clergy sex abuse victims were piling up , @entity3 wrote to the @entity26 office in charge of the matter and recommended it kick @entity117 out			1
last week @entity3 called the @entity191 's @entity190 ruling a ' tragic day for marriage and our nation ' that went against ' the common good of all , especially our children ' ‘ the liability for the @entity199 is great as is the potential for scandal if it appears that no definitive action has been taken , ’ he warned , adding that			0
@entity117 showed no remorse , and ‘ his only concern has been his financial status			0
’ @entity3 said that if the @entity26 agreed to dismiss @entity117 , an archdiocese fund could pay for his needs until he was eligible for a pension			1
@entity3 did n't receive a response until 2008 , when he re-submitted his request along with details of new allegations against @entity117			2
archbishop @entity213 responded on behalf of the @entity26 office and recommended @entity3 ask @entity117 to leave voluntarily , which @entity3 did			1
@entity117 's attorney rejected the request , saying the $ 20,000 payment that @entity3 offered would n't cover the priest 's expenses for the two years until his retirement			1
@entity117 was n't officially defrocked until 2012			0
last week @entity3 issued a joint press release calling the @entity191 's @entity190 ruling a ‘ tragic day for marriage and our nation ’ that went against ‘ the common good of all , especially our children			0
