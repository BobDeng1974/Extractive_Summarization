a @entity1 cruiser came within 30 miles of the @entity3 coast but the @entity4 only had one ship to respond a fully armed @entity4 warship was scrambled to challenge a missile - carrying @entity1 vessel in the waters off @entity3 just days before @entity11 , defence sources revealed last night			1
in a calculated test of @entity3 ’s reduced naval capacity in the @entity15 , the @entity1 warship came within 30 miles of the coast			1
it was detected nearing @entity17 , but the only ship the @entity4 had available to respond after @entity20 cuts was in @entity21 , resulting in a delay of 24 hours until it was in position			1
the threatening approach towards @entity3 ’s territorial waters triggered a top - secret @entity4 and @entity27 operation co-ordinated by the military top brass at the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) bunker at @entity31 , just outside @entity32			0
@entity34 reconnaissance aircraft tracked the progress of the @entity1 warship as it neared north - east @entity17 , and the tension heightened when aerial photographs revealed the ship was carrying a full payload of guided missiles			1
commanders at @entity29 decided to send the new type 45 destroyer @entity43 , which is @entity3 ’s immediate - response ship during a national security crisis			0
the @entity1 ship waited in the @entity46 , a stretch of water that flows into @entity49 , for defender to arrive , as if her captain were recording the @entity4 ’s response times			1
at the time , @entity50 was in dock at @entity21			0
her crew were forced to make the 600 - mile journey around the coastline , because budget cutbacks mean there are no maritime patrol vessels sailing off @entity17			1
a defence source said : ‘ this was no exercise – the @entity1 ship was behaving very aggressively in a stretch of water bordering @entity3 ’s territorial waters			1
‘ they were watched very closely by the @entity34 and it was agreed that @entity43 should block the @entity1 ’ passage			1
a tense stand - off ensued when defender reached the @entity70 as crews tried to establish intentions ‘ defender was fully equipped with @entity74 surface - to - air missiles and guns capable of firing 40kg shells as far as 18 miles			2
her captain and crew knew this was the real deal and were prepared to engage			0
’ a tense stand - off ensued when defender reached the @entity70			0
while the @entity20 last night declined to explain the specific international protocols adhered to at such a delicate moment , @entity83 understands the crews exchanged radio messages in an attempt to establish each other ’s intentions			0
no shots were fired but defender ’s 190 - strong crew remained at battle stations throughout the confrontation			0
the @entity3 crew then watched as the @entity1 ship retreated			1
they followed it north to the @entity97 , where a @entity1 task force was on legitimate manoeuvres			2
defender then sailed back to @entity17 , docking in @entity101 on friday			2
last night , @entity1 expert @entity104 , from the military think - tank the @entity103 , said @entity1 had intended to intimidate @entity3			1
he added : ‘ the @entity1 fleet , which is growing in strength and expanding its sphere of influence , wanted to show a presence in the @entity15 and sail as close as possible to the national sea boundary			2
‘ the @entity1 knew exactly what they were doing			2
they were saying , “ we are back in business in the @entity15 and we are powerful			0
” ‘ they knew how far they could sail before they would be required to withdraw			0
‘ the @entity1 may also be inspecting nuclear installations in @entity17 , with a view towards the independence referendum			1
certainly the @entity1 would see the country as more vulnerable if it were no longer part of @entity3			2
‘ the approach was part of a pattern of behaviour , and the action is more threatening when considered in this context			0
‘ last year @entity1 military jets approached @entity125 airspace and only withdrew when the @entity125 scrambled their aircraft			0
’ after the confrontation between defender and the @entity1 ship , which is believed to have begun on december 20 , the @entity1 military news agency @entity127 released a statement claiming that the vessel was sheltering in the @entity70 because of adverse weather conditions			1
this is the second such incident in two years			0
in december 2011 , the aircraft carrier @entity136 , anti-submarine ship @entity137 and escort ship @entity139 sailed close to @entity17 before being challenged by the @entity4			1
defender is the fifth of the @entity4 ’s six state - of - the - art type 45 destroyers – she was built in @entity101 , which is one of her two affiliated cities			0
the @entity20 refused to comment last night for operational reasons .			0

@entity1 vessel detected 30 miles away from @entity17 last night
only ship available to respond was on south coast of @entity155
tensions heightened when aerial photos showed ship full of missiles
