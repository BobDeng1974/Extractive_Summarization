by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 19 june 2012 as @entity3 ’s elite students , they are the country ’s leaders and thinkers of tomorrow			2
but as the term at @entity8 ended , the occasion became just another chance to get hopelessly drunk and frolic in the streets			1
as the sun came up this morning , throngs of the young and wealthy scions staggered through the streets of the city following the lavish @entity16			1
binge - drinking has become an age - old ritual at @entity8 and there are even special drinking societies that organise debauched events like : @entity47 is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term			2
it historically included members of @entity54 and @entity55 colleges ’ drinking society takes place at a park in @entity8 ’s city centre , on the first bank holiday of the summer term			0
this year thousands of students got drunk , exposed themselves and fought			1
suicide sunday : the party at @entity8 is a traditional event in which hundreds of students celebrated finishing their exams			2
three years ago the @entity69 garden party , organised by the @entity70 , an all - male @entity72 drinking society , had to be held in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students from holding the event on university @entity80 valley rally : its winter equivalent , the @entity80 valley rally , occurs during the annual varsity ski trip , is quickly catching up to suicide sunday ’s levels of debauchery			1
last year female students stripped to their underwear in front of hundreds of onlookers , while both men and women simulated sex acts with each @entity93 drinking society the wyverns drinking society has a reputation for its hard partying and excessive @entity99 initiation ceremony involves eating a 15 - course meal with delicacies such as a pig ’s snout with wasabi sauce and a pint of water with a goldfish swimming inside			1
the ferret drinking society : the @entity110 , an inter-collegiate drinking society , must consume 80 units on their initiation			0
they usually start with a bottle of gin and finish off with a bottle of port - consumed through a condom			2
girls are also encouraged to kiss strangers			0
some were seen hurling abuse at passersby and fighting with security staff as they desperately tried to save the last morsels of their champagne and beer			1
one unsavoury student was even seen flashing his penis in the street and laughing at his own loutish behaviour			0
the women , who - like their male counterparts – were mostly educated at expensive public schools before arriving at @entity8 , were not much more dignified			0
some had to be carried back to their rooms by boyfriends , while others sniggered as they lurched through the same streets once trodden on by eminent scholars like @entity141			1
others continued to celebrate at the expensive end - of - term party with drunken punt rides on the @entity145 and a champagne breakfast in the college gardens			2
the sold - out ball is the largest event of the @entity8 student social calendar and the coveted tickets cost a staggering £ 430 a couple			1
guests were treated to a lavish five - course meal served in @entity155 , followed by music from @entity157 , who is rumoured to have been paid £ 20,000 to headline			1
students could tuck in to oysters , hand - made crepes , a hog roast and a cascading chocolate fountain , while drinks were served from a floating punt on the river			1
they could also opt for luxury spa treatments , a gamble at the casino or relaxing in the jazz tent			0
the night was brought to a close with a spectacular fireworks display			0
one reveller said : ' it was a brilliant night we had copious amounts of champagne and we all really enjoyed ourselves			2
its just a great bit of fun			0
' @entity16 is held on the first monday of @entity69 , which , despite the month in the title , always takes place in june after exams			0
the first one was held in 1838 when 38 @entity185 happily drank their way through 47 bottles of champagne , 12 of sherry , six of @entity190 , two of @entity192 , six quarts of ale and 16 huge servings of punch at a post-race dinner at the @entity197			1
dazed : a student rests on the pavement as others stagger home following the drunken event @entity203 and large : two students - one of whom is wearing only boxer shorts and a jacket - wander along the same streets once trodden upon by eminent scscholars such as sir @entity141 and @entity209 dandified : students dressed in all their finery wander along a lane carrying bouquets of flowers and beer @entity216 , merrily : many students celebrated after the end - of - term party by taking punt rides			1
but it all became too much for one of tomorrow 's possible great minds , right , when he fell asleep during the journey along the river the ball has continued every year since , apart from 1910 when @entity227 died and between 1939 and 1945 during the @entity228			0
this latest intoxicated affair comes just a month after @entity8 students stripped off , vomited , urinated in flower beds and drank themselves into oblivion after more than 2,000 descended on a public park			0
that afternoon culminated in an organised fight between more than 20 male students from the @entity236 – @entity238 ’s drinking society – and their counterparts from @entity54 , the @entity240			0
and events from past years suggest that @entity242 might still have a long way to go to tackle @entity3 ’s ‘ binge drinking ’ culture			0
having a ball : students grin and dance in the street following the coveted event public displays : a couple share a passionate moment on their way home video : the @entity258 performed live at the ball			2

£ 215 - a - ticket @entity21 becomes another excuse to get *recklessly* drunk
wealthy scions leave in the early hours staggering and swearing in streets
some teetered back to their rooms half naked and one flashed his *genitals*
others fought security staff as they were *evicted* from ball first held in 1838
students enjoyed champagne and oysters as they listened to @entity157 sing
