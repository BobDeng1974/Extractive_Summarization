by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 5 april 2013 the only official @entity2 report into future @entity4 and @entity5 migration into @entity6 has been branded a ‘ whitewash ’ – after it failed to answer the key question of how many would arrive next year			1
from january 1 , @entity9 controls on workers from the two countries will expire , allowing almost 29million people free access to work here			1
following repeated refusals by ministers to estimate how many will come , the £ 30,000 @entity16 - commissioned study said it was ‘ not possible to predict the scale of future migration ’ from the two @entity9 countries			1
the @entity24 think - tank has predicted about 50,000 @entity4 and @entity5 migrants could come here every year from next year however , the report did warn an influx could lead to pressure on already scarce primary school places , and of high levels of diseases such as measles among @entity4 nationals			1

’ ‘ it brushes aside any indication of an increase in migration from these countries			0
’ general view of the estate in @entity55 , where up to 400 @entity4 and @entity5 immigrants have moved in since last february experts say the lack of any firm estimate makes it impossible to prepare for the extra pressure new arrivals could put on public services			1

the report , by the @entity66 , was published today despite officials receiving it ‘ in draft ’ as early as december last year			2
it blamed lack of ‘ current data ’ on how many migrants are here , and said there was ‘ no agreed definition ’ of what migration was			2
it said : ‘ estimates of potential migration to the @entity6 are likely to be inaccurate and misleading and our report does not include these			2
’ it suggested @entity4 and @entity5 will migrate to @entity85 and @entity86 – despite much higher unemployment levels there			1
