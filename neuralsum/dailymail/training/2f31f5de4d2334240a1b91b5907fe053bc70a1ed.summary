that @entity1 's untimely passing left her family reeling , goes without saying , but their decision to deal with this shock by making a reality tv show has caused eyebrows to raise			1
while it may be cathartic on some level ; the sorry sight of a bereaved family acting out horrible moments against a background of @entity15 - style suspenseful and worse still - quirky - incidental music feels grossly inappropriate			0
scroll down to watch video ... too much , too soon : @entity18 is comforted by @entity19 as she sits by her mother @entity1 's grave , cameras followed her for her first visit place her teenage daughter 's relationship with the boy @entity1 took into her home at the centre of it amidst a raft of staged showdowns and hokey face pulling , and you have a carcrash			1
worse still , the opening episode features intrusive scenes of 19 - year - old @entity18 , @entity1 's daughter with @entity35 , visiting her mother 's grave for the first time			1
if that does n't pull at your heart strings enough , it 's also @entity43 ... and the hideous voyeurism goes further , underage @entity18 is seen drinking			1
' she 's not at drinking age , ' her aunt complains			2
intrusive : the decision to include this painful visit is dubious at best , oat @entity1 stands to the left as @entity1 's mother @entity52 hugs @entity18 and @entity19 sits by the grave ' please visit me more ' : @entity55 asks her granddaughter to spend more time with her in the future hard to watch : this scene was filmed in may ... just three months after @entity1 's untimely death family time : the whole clan went to @entity1 's grave for the first time @entity18 is seen sipping an alcoholic beverage and turning to her unofficially adopted brother - turned - fiancé , @entity19			1
@entity68 the horribly intrusive scene also includes @entity1 ’s mother , @entity52 , and brother , @entity71 , and yet still manages to feel forced and contrived			0
at least at this point , @entity1 's beautiful , haunting vocal takes over ... rendering the scene some awful poignancy			0
though it 's hard to look at @entity18 with her head in her hands next to the headstone , despite the positivity that @entity1 's sister - in - law @entity79 tries to channel into the occasion			2
' it tastes like apple juice ' : @entity18 's @entity84 does n't want her niece drinking ' not on my watch ' : @entity79 says she wo n't let @entity18 fall by the wayside ' np way , no how ' driving a wedge : @entity18 only wants to be with @entity19 , but @entity79 feels that he 's taking her down the wrong path @entity52 is seen sadly telling her her granddaughter to stay in touch			1
' she was just my mother , ' sad @entity18 tells @entity19			2
' i do n't care about anything else			0
' earlier in the episode , she had shown off her mother 's ring which she told her shocked family represented an engagement token between the pair			0
@entity19 told the camera : ' everyone gets it wrong , i was never officially ... it 's not incest			0
' there may be trouble ahead : @entity1 's brother @entity71 is worried about his niece and his own daughter goofing off : @entity79 set up a meeting with an acting coach for @entity18 but she choose to spend time with @entity19 in an arcade promise rings : @entity18 and @entity19 are engaged , the former says that together with her late mother they were ' the three @entity121 ' @entity79 feels that @entity18 needs to focus on work to help with grieving , instead of her close relationship with @entity19			2
she encourages her to see an acting coach , after admitting to camera that @entity18 was happy working with @entity128 on @entity129			2
' acting is a refuge for me , ' @entity18 admits			0
tentative : @entity52 and @entity18 have a fractious relationship but @entity79 is working on that ' i just want you to look after her ' : @entity71 offers to give @entity19 some advice in pain : @entity18 is understandably suffering in the footage , with her mother not long gone response on @entity140 was almost unanimously negative ; with many commentators horrified at the state of @entity18 and the fact she was being film just three months after her mother 's death			1
@entity147 summed up the general consensus by writing : ' @entity18 needs prayers for strength and clarity , not a reality show ! # @entity154			0
' @entity155 wrote : ' wow , they started this reality show just 3 months after she died ! ! why are they really doing this ? # @entity154			0
' a teaser preview at the end of the show hinted that @entity18 's relationship with her father @entity35 - who was arrested today in @entity165 for @entity166 - will be fully explored .			1

filming started just three months after star 's untimely death
