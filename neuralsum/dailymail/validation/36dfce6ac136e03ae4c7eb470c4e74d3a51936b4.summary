@entity1 will form an electoral pact with @entity4 mps to keep the @entity5 in power after the next election , @entity0 said this morning			1
the @entity1 leader said the @entity9 will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own			1
mr @entity0 said he would force an early referendum on @entity16 's membership of the @entity17 as his price for keeping @entity19 in @entity20			1
@entity1 leader @entity0 said the @entity9 will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own the @entity1 leader 's intervention comes amid growing pressure on the @entity5 to rule out a power - sharing deal with @entity1 after the election			1
mr @entity19 has repeatedly challenged @entity26 to reject a coalition with the @entity28 , but has side - stepped questions about whether the @entity9 would rely on @entity1 to form a government			1
but mr @entity0 said this morning said he would not have a choice			0
he said : ' at the end of the day , this is all about numbers , is n't it ? ' he added : ' i mean i still believe that the @entity9 will be the biggest party – not least of which is because @entity40 's party is doing so well in @entity41			0
' i think between @entity1 and possibly the @entity43 in @entity4 as well , there will be a body of mps there to have significant influence and to force a referendum on our @entity17 membership			1
' mr @entity0 has previously insisted he would be willing to support a @entity9 minority government only if a referendum on @entity16 leaving the @entity17 was held before the end of this year – two years earlier than @entity19 plans			1
@entity0 said @entity1 would form an electoral pact with @entity4 mps to keep the @entity5 in power after the next election the @entity5 have insisted that mr @entity19 needs two years to re-negotiate @entity16 's membership of the @entity17			1
but mr @entity19 said : ' @entity60 and mr @entity61 , the two bosses of the @entity17 , have made it perfectly clear there is no renegotiation			2
' when it comes to the fundamental point of the free movement of people and immigration into the @entity16 , which is the number one issue in @entity16 politics and i think between now and may 7 will start to dominate this general election campaign , there is no renegotiation			0
' @entity19 may be forced to rely on @entity1 and @entity43 mps to stay as prime minister mr @entity60 – the @entity79 president – last week claimed mr @entity19 's proposal for a new @entity17 treaty was ' @entity82 '			1
but the prime minister , speaking in @entity83 on friday , said a @entity9 victory in the @entity85 would give him a ' very powerful mandate ' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible			0
he added : ' @entity89 normally prevails in the end			0
he 's a little bit smaller than me , but i hope to be just as effective			0
' but mr @entity19 has refused to rule out a coalition with @entity1 , telling @entity94 : ' i do n't want to have a coalition with anybody			2
' i 'm fighting for a majority government , there are 93 days to go and i 'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory			0
' last week the chancellor @entity101 demanded that @entity26 say it would not form a coalition with the @entity28 , who are expected to make big gains in @entity41			0
but he refused to make the same promise about a @entity9 - @entity1 tie - up			2
appearing on @entity109 's @entity108 show , mr @entity101 said : ' it 's just total nonsense , voting for @entity0 makes @entity111 the likely prime minister and it means instead of getting the referendum on @entity114 we get no referendum at all , so that 's what a vote for @entity1 is about and it 's a fundamentally different situation from the @entity28 , you were asking @entity120 about it , he again refused to rule out a deal with the @entity28			2
' we are fighting for a majority , we only need 23 more seats to get that majority			0
' @entity0 and indeed @entity120 are trying to muddy the waters , it 's a fundamentally different situation for this reason - @entity0 is not going to win seats in the @entity131 , even on his own boasts he 's only going to win a small handful			0
' the @entity28 are likely to win dozens of seats because of the collapse of the @entity26 , @entity111 ca n't be prime minister without the support of @entity40 and that creates an alliance between those who want to bankrupt the country and those who want to break up the country			0
' @entity0 said @entity143 could join forces with @entity43 members , led by @entity146 ( left ) , in the @entity147 to keep @entity19 in @entity20 mr @entity0 has claimed that his party will win a ' handful ' of seats at the election , which means the @entity5 would likely also need the support of @entity4 's @entity43 ( @entity43 ) to maintain a minority government			1
@entity1 would back the @entity5 ' first budget if a referendum on @entity16 's @entity17 membership was promised before the end of 2015			1
up until now , the prime minister has vowed to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 , and has said he will campaign to stay in a reformed @entity17			2
but the latest polls suggest neither the @entity9 or @entity26 will have enough seats to form a government , meaning mr @entity19 may have to find a compromise .			0

@entity1 leader said the @entity5 will emerge from the election as largest party
but he said @entity19 would not have enough mps to form a majority
he said @entity1 would form a pact with the @entity43 to keep the @entity5 in power
in return @entity1 will demand an early in - out referendum on the @entity17
