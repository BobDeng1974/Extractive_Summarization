@entity0 admitted he was glad to ‘ get his head down and play golf again ’ after a six - week break where court rather than course matters have taken priority			1
the 25 - year - old ’s brilliant season has unfolded despite being involved in an increasingly bitter legal battle with his former management company			0
@entity0 had to pull out of two tournaments in @entity13 last month to sift through documents with his lawyers ahead of a case that should finally reach a @entity18 courtroom early next year			1

@entity0 signs the guest book at the official opening of the new clubhouse at @entity24 @entity0 in action during the pro-am event prior to the @entity28 in @entity29 this week ' @entity30 , coach @entity31 , @entity0 and sports scientist @entity32 @entity0 is back on the golf course after a distracting few weeks focusing on a court case @entity0 was so far ahead of the rest his enforced absence still made no difference with regard to him winning the race to @entity29			1
that was sewn up last sunday , but he ’s determined that this week ’s season finale , the @entity28 , is something more than just a 72 - hole lap of honour			2
‘ i ’m proud obviously of the way i played this season and how many points i accumulated to win the race to @entity29 but there would be no point me just showing up here if i did n’t want to pick up two trophies on sunday rather than one , ’ he warned			2
‘ i ’m not here just to have a good time , and i ’m comfortable playing on this course			0
i ’ve played well here basically every year and i won the event in 2012			2
‘ so it would be nice to finish the season off with another win , and it could be that i ’m a lot fresher than most of the guys and can use that to my advantage			0
i think there ’s a few jaded minds and bodies among the players who have played the last three events in @entity13 and @entity68			0
’ legal matters aside , @entity0 was in fine fettle			2

‘ @entity83 has become a good friend and hopefully he will be just the start of a few names coming on board and playing			0
we actually played each other in the @entity90 at @entity75 in 2007 , so it will be nice to rekindle that contest in a way , and we ’ve had a good few battles this year as well , in the majors and the @entity96			1
’ @entity0 defeated @entity83 down the stretch to win both @entity76 and the @entity77 , before wiping the floor with him in a singles match at the @entity96 at @entity100			1
