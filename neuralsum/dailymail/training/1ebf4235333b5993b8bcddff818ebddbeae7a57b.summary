@entity0 will have to resign if @entity1 votes for independence , according to some @entity3 amid growing fears that the @entity6 campaign could win this autumn ’s referendum			1
one senior conservative said mr @entity0 would ‘ go down in history as the prime minister who lost the union ’ and would have no choice but to quit @entity14			1
it came as @entity17 @entity16 called for a law change to block @entity1 voters from taking part in the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year			1
senior @entity3 warn @entity0 could go down in history as the prime minister who lost the union votes in @entity1 will have their say on independence in a referendum on september 18			1
recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising , with the no campaign ’s lead narrowing			2
in a major political headache , if @entity1 votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016			2
it means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to take part in the 2015 general election to choose mps for @entity43			1
senior @entity3 now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election			1
the move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election next year , wiping out a significant section of @entity54 's powerbase and a sizeable number of @entity56			0
in may 2010 @entity54 won 41 seats , the @entity56 11 , the @entity58 six while the @entity17 secured just one mp			0
first minister @entity60 has been buoyed by polls showing a narrowing between the @entity6 and no campaigns so far , there has been no decision on what would happen to @entity1 's @entity43 seats between parliamentary elections and march 2016 , when it would become an independent nation , in the event of a yes vote this autumn			1
it is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but @entity1 mps would then vacate their seats when links are severed			2
tories believe it would unacceptable , however , for them to hold their seats while @entity80 and @entity81 were negotiating the break - up of the @entity83 @entity1 - born @entity84 , who represents @entity85 , told @entity86 : ‘ why should the peoples of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 have laws passed in this @entity92 by mps who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country ? ’ @entity14 insists mr @entity0 is focussed on winning the referendum to keep @entity1 in the @entity83 , so the issue will not arise			1
but privately many @entity3 believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence			1
a minister said : ‘ it would be very difficult because he would go down in history as the prime minister who lost the union			2
’ a no 10 source said : ‘ the prime minister is focused on making the case for @entity1 to remain part of the @entity83			0
’ a record 4.1million @entity1 are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum			2
the figure is almost 60,000 more than in december 2012 and has been fuelled by 16 and 17 - yearolds who are not eligible to take part in @entity119 or @entity1 elections but can do so in the referendum			0
around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young @entity1 have signed up			0
the figures have been compiled by the @entity124 's 15 @entity1 electoral registration officers ( @entity125 ) , following an annual canvas of voters between october 2013 and march 2014			0
the deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is september 2 , 2014			0
@entity130 , head of the @entity1 office at the @entity124 , said : ' the snapshot provided by the publication of the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already put in by electoral registration officers , but that hard work does n't stop now			0
' the @entity125 will continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to take action and get themselves registered before the september 2 deadline , in order to take part in the referendum			0
' the commission will support @entity125 activities by launching a public awareness campaign in the summer , reminding people that the only way to vote at the referendum is to be on the register			0
