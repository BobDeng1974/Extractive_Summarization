by @entity1 reporter published : 08:41 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 09:55 est , 30 july 2012 ruling : former @entity3 international player @entity2 , 33 , took legal action against @entity5 a black footballer has won a landmark case after an employment tribunal ruled he was racially victimised at his former club			1
former @entity3 international player @entity2 , 33 , took legal action against the @entity5 after being dismissed for alleged misconduct last year			1
his claim for race discrimination - thought to be the first by a professional footballer - and unfair dismissal was brought against the @entity17 side and its chairman @entity18			0
the 6ft 2in striker told a hearing in @entity21 , @entity22 , that he and other black players at the club were treated differently from white players			1
@entity2 said he was ordered to come into the ground amid ' treacherous ' , snowy driving conditions while some white players were told they were not required			1
he also said the club tried to ' frustrate him out ' by refusing to pay private medical bills to help him regain his fitness following injury			2
instead , he claims he was offered the same operation on the @entity35 rather than privately , a move he described as ' completely out of character ' for a @entity39 club , and that he was fined two weeks ' wages when he paid a visit to a private consultant			2
in contrast , the former @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 player said , a white team - mate was flown to @entity50 for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club 's expense			1
in a letter sent to the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) outlining his grievances , @entity2 also claimed he was told not to blog while others were permitted to			1
@entity2 told the tribunal that he had been put ' through hell ' at @entity5 and had not been given an answer over why he was treated differently to other players			1
@entity50 - based @entity5 chairman @entity18 described @entity2 's claims as being made ' maliciously and without foundation ' , adding that the club had not had to deal with an allegation of racism in 18 years			1
@entity2 said that during an injury spell , he had to stay behind at the club for four hours longer than the other injured and non-injured players			1
he claimed this was on the ' strict instructions ' of mr @entity18			0
' once the players had all left , i sat there watching mind - numbing daytime tv and @entity79 's @entity78 , ' he said			2
' the process of waiting was designed to inflict maximum levels of frustration on me and it certainly had that impact			0
sitting at the club instead of progressing with my operation was like watching paint dry			2
' defeat : @entity5 owner and chairman @entity18 - the club said they were ' staggered ' by the ruling the events which led up to @entity2 's dismissal were triggered on november 30 2010 , when south - east @entity93 bore the brunt of heavy snowfall			1
on that day , @entity2 said he and two other black players - @entity97 and @entity98 - were told to make the four - mile drive from the house they shared to the club 's medical rooms			1
' one of my housemates had contacted another player who lived about two miles nearer to the club who was also due to attend the medical centre with us on that day , ' @entity2 's statement said			1
' he was a white player who had informed us that the club physiotherapist had told him that he was not required to come in on that day because of the snow			1
dismissed : @entity2 was paid £ 2,500 a week and was the club 's highest paid player ' there was a further player we contacted who was in the same boat , ie he needed to attend the club for physio on the same day			1
he lived further down in @entity22 in @entity124 and had a longer drive in			0
' he was white and had been informed by the club staff that he also did not need to come in for the day because of the snowy conditions			2
' later , @entity2 said one of them received a text message threatening to dock them two weeks ' wages unless they made it to the stadium by midday			2
when he arrived at the club , @entity2 said he headed to manager @entity138 's room to confront him about being ' racially intolerant ' over the decision to order them in			1
he claimed that @entity138 reacted angrily			0
' he lost his temper and flayed the contents of his table			0
he pushed the table over , throwing overboard the computer on it and all its other contents			0
' it was the most aggressive and temperamental physical display of tantrum i had ever seen			0
the body poise in his language as he stood up to address me was a stance that stated : ' how dare you talk to me ? ' ' i was concerned he was going to attack me and i asked whether he was planning to hit me			0
' @entity2 was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed			1
the forward said that after leaving the club , @entity5 ' were effectively campaigning covertly against me ' by trying to sabotage his career			1
strong interest was shown following his departure by 11 clubs but talks with all collapsed , often at a late stage			0
' it soon became known that the chairman had been interfering , ' @entity2 said in his statement			2
' my agent was told by other agents that the job he was doing was an impossible one as they were aware that @entity5 were effectively campaigning covertly against me with the intention of sabotaging my career			1
' @entity2 signed for @entity5 in 2008 on £ 2,500 a week and was the club 's highest paid player			1
' it was a phenomenal deal , ' he said			0
' it was a deal that most players would have taken			0
' but he disputed claims that the ' trade - off ' for such a generous salary was that if @entity5 remained in @entity17 during contract terms , his salary would be cut by 15 percent			2
@entity2 said : ' there was absolutely no way i would have agreed to that			2
that was n't making sense to me			0
' the tribunal has heard that a clerical error in @entity2 's contract meant the 15 percent line was accidentally omitted despite being agreed verbally			1
key moment : @entity195 and @entity197 's @entity196 clash during the @entity199 match at @entity200 legal experts estimated mr @entity2 would expect to receive in excess of £ 40,000 compensation , although the figure could be higher			1
however , mr @entity2 's barrister today confirmed the tribunal panel had reserved its decision on compensation until a hearing , scheduled for august 10			1
@entity210 , of @entity211 , @entity212 , said the ruling represented a landmark in @entity79 football - as the first instance of racial victimisation being proved by a player			0
he said : ' usually , most disputes between club and player are dealt with by the @entity39 or the @entity222 internally			2
' however , this is the first race victimisation case that a footballer has brought before an employment tribunal , in a public forum			0
' officials at @entity5 said they were ' staggered ' by the ruling , saying the club had employed thousands of staff of different races and religions			2
the club said in a statement : ' today we have received the decision of the @entity238 which sets out their findings that @entity2 was unfairly dismissed and that his dismissal was an act of racial victimisation			1
' we are hugely disappointed , in fact staggered , by this decision			0
as an organisation we are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate against , nor victimise our staff			0
' this case is the first of its kind to be brought against the club in its entire history , a history that has seen the club employ many thousands of staff of various race , religion and creed , none of whom have ever felt the need to bring such a claim			0
' given the nature of the case , and the findings , we will discuss the judgment with our lawyers and decide upon the next course of action , whether that be an appeal against the findings , or another form of action , as deemed appropriate			0
' there will be no further comment on the case by the club until the matter has run its full course			0
' @entity2 's explosive case comes after high - profile incidents concerning racism allegations in football			2
this week @entity195 vowed to fight an @entity222 charge of making a racist remark towards @entity197 defender @entity196			0
@entity195 was found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence at @entity285 on july 13			0
last season @entity212 's @entity286 was banned for racially abusing @entity287 but that case never went to court			0
in february @entity290 hosted a summit at 10 @entity292 amid widespread concern over racism in football .			0
