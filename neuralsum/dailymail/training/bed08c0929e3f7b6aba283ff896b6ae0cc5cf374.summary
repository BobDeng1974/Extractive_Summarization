women who follow a diet rich in fruit , vegetables and fish , which is closely associated with the traditional @entity4 diet , were less likely to suffer from major chronic diseases and physical ailments			1

time to make a lifestyle change ? a new study has found women on a @entity4 diet are 40 % more likely to live past 70 lead researcher @entity19 , a postdoctoral fellow who conducted the study while at @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 , said : ' we found that greater quality of diet at midlife was strongly associated with increased odds of good health and well - being among individuals surviving to older ages			1
' women with healthier dietary patterns at midlife were 40 per cent more likely to survive to age 70 or over			2
' maintaining physical , cognitive , and mental health with aging may provide a more powerful incentive for dietary change than simply prolonging life or avoiding any single chronic disease			0
' ms @entity19 , who is now a researcher at @entity43 and @entity42 , in @entity44 , added that those on a @entity4 diet were more likely to be classed as ' healthy agers ' although only 11 per cent of participants were classified as healthy agers overall			2
back to basics : a typical @entity4 diet is rich in fruit , vegetables , fish , chicken and olive oil but is low in red meats and saturated fat ms @entity19 and her colleagues evaluated the diet and medical records of more than 10,000 women in their late 50s or early 60s who took part in a larger nurses ’ @entity66 between 1984 and 1986			1
they then asked the same women about their health an average of 15 years later			0
ms @entity19 described the @entity4 diet as being characterized by a greater intake of fruits , vegetables , legumes , whole grains and fish ; a lower intake of red and processed meats ; moderate intake of alcohol ; higher amounts of monounsaturated fats , mostly provided by olive oil from @entity4 countries ; and lower amounts of saturated fats			1
the researcher believes the diet would have a similar impact on men			0
but the director of university nutrition at @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 , pointed out the study is only observational , telling health.com : ' @entity98 can not be exclusively linked '			0
the study , funded by the @entity100 and the @entity101 , will be published this month in the journal @entity103 .			0
