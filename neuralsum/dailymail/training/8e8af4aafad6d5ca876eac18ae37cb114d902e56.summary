by @entity0 last updated at 2:46 pm on 12th december 2011 a former soldier is facing his last @entity2 with his children after being refused a life - prolonging cancer drug because he lives in the wrong town			1
@entity7 ’s long battle with cancer has culminated in a fight for the drug avastin which his consultant said could give him vital time with his daughter @entity13 , six , and son @entity14 , five			1
but @entity16 bosses have refused to fund the medicine , even though it is readily available to patients just 15 miles from where mr @entity7 lives in @entity21 , @entity22			1
' they are playing @entity23 ' : @entity7 , pictured with his wife @entity24 with their children @entity13 and @entity14 , has been denied access to the drug @entity29 to treat his brain cancer the 37 - year - old was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003			1
he was told in august this year that his cancer had spread and that @entity29 , which costs £ 21,000 for a ten - month course , was his last hope			1
his doctor gave him just 12 months to live			1
the former private , who completed tours in @entity39 and @entity40 during nine years with the @entity41 , said : ' i was hoping the drug would help me see another couple of @entity45			2
' i love my family to bits and want to be able to spend as much time as i can with them			0
it would n’t be a cure , but it would be the best thing to prolong my life			1
' this @entity2 we are just going to try and make as many memories as we can as it will probably be my last one			0
' soldier : mr @entity7 completed tours in @entity39 and @entity40 during nine years with the @entity41 his wife @entity24 added : ' it ’s devastating that they have n’t said yes to this treatment , we just ca n’t understand it			1
' it should just be that everyone is given the same access to treatment regardless of where they live			1
' it just seems so unfair that if we lived in @entity72 , which is only 15 miles away , we would get it			0
' mr @entity7 was first diagnosed with a benign tumour in 2003 when he was 29 , which was removed through open brain surgery			2
doctors told the couple that the tumour would probably return and routine scans in 2006 found the tumour had come back - only this time it was malignant			2
mr @entity7 underwent another operation to remove it , followed by six months of radiotherapy			2
then in january 2010 , another tumour was discovered and further open brain surgery carried out , followed by nine months of chemotherapy			0
despite all the treatment , the tumour returned aggressively in january this year and it was discovered in august that further chemotherapy treatment had not worked			2
it was at that point mr @entity7 said his consultant suggested @entity29 , a tumour - starving therapy that works by preventing the blood vessels reaching the tumour			1
but letters to the @entity91 as well as @entity92 were knocked back			0
the drug is not currently ' readily approved ' as a treatment by the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , which means funding for it sits with the @entity91			0
@entity22 said decisions to fund treatments are based on clear clinical evidence , cost - effectiveness , the benefit to patient and consideration of national guidance			0
@entity29 works by preventing the blood vessels reaching the tumour			0
the drug is mr @entity7 's last hope a spokesman from @entity92 said : ' we were sorry to hear about this patient ’s individual circumstances			1
unfortunately , we are unable to comment further on individual cases			0
' currently , @entity29 is not readily approved by @entity95 guidance and therefore funding for treatment that falls outside of @entity95 sits with @entity91			0
' decisions about whether to fund drugs from the @entity91 are made solely by cancer specialists			0
' @entity16 @entity119 does not fund @entity29 for brain cancer patients , but @entity121 and the @entity122 does			0
this means it is available for patients just 15 miles away in @entity72 , and in @entity126 where @entity7 had all of his cancer treatment , but not in @entity21			2
mr @entity7 said : ' i ’m just so angry that people can play with your life by saying who can and ca n’t have treatment			1
' they are playing @entity23			0
' with an uncertain future ahead of them , @entity7 and mrs @entity136 renewed their vows last month on their tenth wedding anniversary .			2
