by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 28 february 2013 a coroner yesterday attacked the box - ticking culture among gps after hearing how a desperately ill baby was not seen quickly enough			1
dr @entity5 spoke out as she ruled that @entity6 died following ‘ wholly inadequate ’ decisions made by an out - of - hours doctor based on a one - minute phone call			1
dr @entity11 ignored the pleas from @entity13 for her seven - week - old son , who was suffering from pneumonia , to be seen as soon as possible , an inquest was told			1
@entity16 with his mother @entity17			0
he died from pneumonia despite his mother calling and visiting a privately - run out of hours gp centre several times he downgraded her call from ‘ urgent ’ to ‘ routine ’ and left her waiting for nearly four hours for an appointment because he did not deem the baby ’s situation an emergency			1
with her dying son in her arms , the 35 - year - old mother then had to wait in line behind six non-emergency patients at the private out - of - hours gp service @entity34 , at @entity35 in @entity36 , north @entity37			1
@entity38 heard that it was only when an off - duty nurse spotted that @entity6 had turned ‘ grey and floppy ’ that he received emergency care – but by then it was too late and he died at the hospital from bronchopneumonia five days after falling ill. recording a narrative verdict , dr @entity46 described the brief phone conversation between dr @entity11 and mrs @entity6 as ‘ wholly inadequate ’ , adding that the doctor ‘ asked insufficient questions ’			2
she said : ‘ it lasted only one minute and the entries made are clearly at odds with the evidence from mrs @entity6			0
’ mrs @entity16 told the inquest that when she arrived at the private @entity61 clinic with @entity6 , who was no longer breathing , she was told by a receptionist to ' wait in line ' @entity6 ’s mother said that after she spoke to dr @entity11 at 12.45pm on november 3 last year , he made them an appointment for 4pm , but when they arrived they had to queue to be seen			2
by this time @entity6 had become unresponsive and he went into cardiac arrest			0
mrs @entity6 , of @entity70 , north @entity37 , said that on october 31 she took @entity6 to her own gp , who diagnosed him with a viral infection			1
the next day , when his condition had not improved , she took him to the @entity34 centre			2
she saw dr @entity75 , who told her @entity6 ’s lungs were clear and gave them a prescription for antibiotics so they would not have to go back if the baby ’s condition changed			0
the coroner described @entity34 ’s medical services as ‘ robust ’ , adding ‘ call backs and consultations up until 3 november were admitted appropriately ’			2
she added : ‘ it is impossible to say whether intervention at an earlier stage would have changed the tragic outcome			0
’ seven - week old @entity6 was treated at the @entity34 centre at the @entity35 in @entity37 ( pictured ) before he died mrs @entity6 had said earlier in the inquest that she believed her previous visit to dr @entity75 had been insufficient			1
but dr @entity46 said she was satisfied that his consultation was carried out in an appropriate manner			0
during the inquest , the coroner said gps were obliged to practise ‘ defensive medicine ’ where the focus is on writing lengthy notes rather than on ‘ spending time assessing individuals and communicating with the family ’			1
she said : ‘ we live in an age where there is an assumption that if it is n’t written down , it is n’t done , so we can have a situation where doctors do very little in their consultation but have perfect records			0
’ on the other hand , she added : ‘ we can have perfectly good consultations with doctors that cover the ground but are no good on paper simply because they have not ticked every box , which is worrying			0
’ @entity6 ’s death is the latest controversy involving @entity34 – the largest private provider of @entity121 out - of - hours gp services in the country which is responsible for the care of eight million patients			1
last year there were allegations that the service is so short - staffed it is regularly unsafe – and that managers were regularly sending out ‘ mayday ’ text messages requiring urgent cover for shifts where there was no one on duty			0
after the inquest , mrs @entity6 and her husband , @entity138 , 36 , a media manager , said : ‘ we believe there are still many questions to answer about the safety of the service provided by @entity34			2
‘ we do not believe that anyone hearing all the evidence in this case could have full confidence in @entity34 ’s out - of - hours services			1
we are now considering all our options to prevent any other children from falling through the net			0

dr @entity5 said gps were obliged to practice ' defensive medicine '
