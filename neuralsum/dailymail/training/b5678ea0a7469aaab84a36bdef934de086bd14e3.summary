the crew of a @entity2 nuclear submarine faced death in soaring temperatures when its air conditioning failed , it emerged yesterday			1
commanding officer @entity6 feared members of his 130 - strong crew would die during the 2011 incident on @entity10 , which had surfaced in the @entity11			1
equipment began failing in @entity14 temperatures and men were collapsing			1
commander @entity6 ordered the sub to dive and it finally cooled in deep waters			1
it emerged that inlet pipes were blocked by crabs and barnacles			1
close shave : commander @entity6 on the bridge of his submarine , which was nearly the scene of a disaster when its air conditioning systems got clogged with crabs and barnacles as he sailed in the @entity11 the astonishing near - miss was revealed three years on by retired commander @entity31 , 44 , who described it as the biggest crisis he faced in 25 - years ' service			1
commander @entity31 said the incident began at 10.30am on may 26 , 2011 , three hours after @entity37 had left @entity38 in the @entity39			1
the boat was surfaced and the decorated officer was on the bridge when he received word the air conditioning units had failed			1
soon afterwards the first of dozens of ' pipe ' sounds - signalling a casualty - rang out			2
commander @entity31 arrived in the sailor 's cabin to find him crying and shaking , clearly suffering from heat exhaustion			1
within hours almost every free space on board the 275ft submarine had become a makeshift sick bay			2
action stations : commander @entity6 , 44 , now retired , said the incident began at 10.30am on may 26 , 2011 , three hours after @entity10 had left @entity38 in the @entity39 commander @entity31 , a married father of two from @entity58 , @entity59 , said : ' i came down below and i was met with this incredible blast of heat			1
' i genuinely thought there was going to be a loss of life on board			2
people were going to die			2
people were just collapsing everywhere , many at their work stations			2
' we had casualties in the control room , the engine room , the bridge , the wardroom , cabins , and the toilets and showers			2
' it was absolutely terrifying , and i 'm not afraid to say i was scared			2
i remember looking at a picture of my family quickly thinking " we need to pull through this "			2
' walking around the boat i saw true fear in my crew 's eyes			1
i saw genuine concern because we simply did not know how we were going to get through it			2
' i felt like the world was against us			2
i was looking up and asking " when are you going to give me a break to gain the upper hand here ? " people were crying - it was all about survival			0
' @entity10 was commissioned in 1984 to hunt @entity98 submarines and decommissioned in july 2012 commander @entity31 had never heard of a similar malfunction and to make matter worse his repair crews could not get close enough to the faulty equipment because it was too hot to touch			1
with a fifth of this staff now ill he ruled out a return to @entity38 and instead ordered two of the submarine 's hatches to be opened to vent some of the heat			1
a number of the casualties were taken outside but with the air outside measuring a sweltering 42 degrees there was little respite			0
the knock on effect of losing the air conditioning also meant other vital systems had begun to fail - but the boat was still able to dive			1
sinking to a depth of more than 200 metres , the temperatures finally began to drop			0
just 24 hours later , with systems all returned to normal and the crew having recovered , @entity10 continued on with its deployment			1
the boat was commissioned in 1984 to hunt @entity98 missile submarines and decommissioned in july 2012			0
after the end of the @entity130 she conducted intelligence gathering missions and commando landings , as well as firing @entity134 missiles during the @entity135			0
submariners aboard a @entity138 class submarine like @entity10 : commander @entity31 retired in march but says his experiences have been incorporated into @entity142 submarine training scenarios commander @entity31 , its commanding officer for three years , retired in march but says his experiences have been incorporated into submarine training scenarios			1
@entity144 said : ' it was touch and go before we dived as to what might happen to us and the submarine			0
' we could n't do anything			0
i could have radioed for help but it would have taken hours for anyone to reach us			0
in that time people would have died			0
' we were alone in our steel tube			0
there really was no - one to call			0
' there 's not a day that goes by that i do not think about what happened			0
the pain of seeing my crew like that			1
' but when i think back to that time i quickly remember how fantastic they all were in dealing with the situation			0
' we recovered from it			0
they did exactly what they had to do , and looked after the team			0
' now that i 've left the @entity142 i feel i can openly and honestly talk about how amazing and incredible the service is			0
' the medical team was made up of one @entity174 medic , another medic , and six or seven first - aiders and they did an unbelievable job under intense pressure			0
' that particular experience brought out some amazing actions from people who are rarely recognised , if ever , for what they do			0
' @entity10 , a @entity138 , was decommissioned in july 2012 at the end of a career of nearly 30 years , although this was not connected to the incident			1
the boat launched @entity134 missiles into @entity189 in 2003 and was involved in operations off the @entity192 coast			0
a @entity142 spokesman said : ‘ in 2011 , a technical issue in @entity10 resulted in a temporary rise in temperature on board the submarine			1
‘ the problem , which caused no damage to the submarine or its reactor systems , was resolved by the crew after a few hours using standard operating procedures			1
‘ a number of personnel who showed signs of heat related symptoms were treated by the submarine ’s medical team			0

astonishing close shave revealed by retired commander @entity6
he was sailing @entity10 away from the @entity39 in the @entity11
the crew was only saved when he ordered the sub to dive into cool waters
