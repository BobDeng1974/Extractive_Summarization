by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:20 am on 1st february 2012 they are the words everyone dreads hearing from their doctor ... and the fact they are delivered over the phone can only compound the trauma			1
yet last night it emerged that many patients are being told they have cancer in a phone call rather than a face - to - face meeting			1
it seems that the traditional practice of a doctor breaking the news in person is becoming a thing of the past			1
@entity24 , part of the @entity26			1
staff have been reminded that telling a patient they have cancer on the phone is ' inappropriate ' @entity31 , founder of @entity32 , said the development was outrageous			1
‘ it is a scandal that so many cancer patients are being given their diagnosis in this way , ’ he added			2
‘ we have had many calls from families who are upset about this			0
’ yesterday , staff at one @entity44 trust were officially rebuked for telling patients they had cancer over the phone			1
@entity49 , chairman of @entity26 in @entity50 , told the trust ’s directors he had been shocked such a warning was needed			1
but on internet support forums , dozens of cancer patients said the same thing had happened to them			0
the phone call incident was the subject of one of 82 complaints made to the trust between october and december 2011 ( posed ) one man said he had complained after his wife was given the news in this way			1
‘ she was on her own in the house – no one else with her , ’ he wrote on the @entity67 forum			0
‘ it just beggars belief – do they not do this in training to be a doctor , how to break bad news to patients ? ’ dozens of patients then replied to his message , saying they had had the same experience			1
they said being given the news by phone was ‘ pitiful ’			2
incredibly , one man said his wife had been told to pass him the message that he had cancer by a doctor who called them at home			1

’ a second woman said being told of her cancer over the phone was the worst moment of her whole life			2
‘ she added : ‘ i spent four hours crying alone until my husband came home			0
’ many said telling patients they had cancer over the phone was insensitive and should be banned			2
‘ it ’s not like you are phoning to see if you ’ve passed your gcses , ’ one said			0
‘ i wonder how someone who is mentally fragile , already depressed , vulnerable and alone would cope			0
’ one patient said he was shocked when a doctor told him over the phone that ‘ it would be a miracle if he did n’t have cancer ’			1
at this point , he said , they had not even received the results of his biopsy			0
one woman said she ‘ always knew this would n’t be an easy journey ’ but said it had been made much more difficult by the fact that no one had spoken to her face to face			0
a spokesman for @entity134 said a cancer diagnosis was the most devastating news that can be received from a doctor and that the news should always be given face to face to ensure the patient is properly supported			2
@entity141 , of @entity142 , said : ‘ you can not guarantee the patient will have friends and family around them to help support them			0
