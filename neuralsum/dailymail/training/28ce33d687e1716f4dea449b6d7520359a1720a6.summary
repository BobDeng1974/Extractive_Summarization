by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 02:02 est , 20 may 2013 support for the @entity3 @entity2 has grown with two opinion polls giving the party record levels of support			1
an @entity8 poll put @entity10 's party on 20 per cent , while a @entity12 survey put them on 19 per cent			1
the @entity12 poll for the @entity14 and @entity15 on sunday found support for @entity10 's party was up four per cent since the last survey a month ago , with @entity18 down three points to 35 per cent , the @entity20 down one to 29 per cent and the @entity21 were unchanged on eight per cent			1
@entity10 outside the @entity23 's @entity22 , @entity24 on thursday			2
the @entity2 leader retreated from protestors but will be in a more buoyant mood following latest poll figures @entity10 has no need to hold recruitment signs ( pic right ) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support			1
he appeared on last sunday 's @entity37 in a discussion about an @entity40 referendum and his party 's supporters despite a week of controversy , in which @entity2 leader @entity10 visited @entity24 and was trapped in a pub by angry protestors , public backing for the party has never been higher			1
the @entity3 @entity2 leader said the left - wing extremists who trapped him were the ‘ ugly face of @entity53 nationalism ’ pursuing an anti-english agenda			1
however , poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted ' racist scumbag ' and ' scum ' at the leader , who has begun to pose a real threat as a major political party			2
the @entity8 poll for the @entity63 put @entity18 on 37 per cent , @entity64 on 27 per cent and the @entity21 on seven per cent			2
according to the @entity12 study 46 per cent of @entity3 would vote to leave the @entity40 in a referendum now , compared with 24 per cent who would stay in			2
but if some powers were returned to the @entity3 from @entity68 43 per cent would vote to remain in the @entity40 , with just 24 per cent determined to see @entity3 leave			0
@entity10 's popularity was not mirrored in @entity24 , where he said ' @entity53 nationalists are @entity72 scum ' results show that the @entity2 leader 's image is appealing to the public			1
@entity20 council leader @entity77 said mr @entity10 ' uses soundbites that appeal to @entity20 ' the poll found just 26 per cent said @entity80 was a good prime minister , a record low in @entity12 studies , while 31 per cent believed @entity83 was performing well as @entity18 leader , a new high			1
the @entity12 survey also revealed that 57 per cent of voters believed mr @entity80 's party was more divided over @entity88 than it was under sir @entity89 , with 14 per cent disagreeing			2
but there was some comfort for the prime minister , with 49 per cent of voters saying the offer of a @entity88 referendum would be important to them at the next general election , with 27 per cent disagreeing			0
and 32 per cent believed mr @entity80 would make the best prime minister of the party leaders , with 24 per cent opting for mr @entity83			0
labour leader @entity83 ( left ) and pm @entity80 have had seen their support dwindle at the hands of @entity2 @entity18 former cabinet minister @entity103 today attacked the ' @entity3 isolation party ' and the ' provisional wing ' of the conservatives for forcing mr @entity80 into making his referendum promise			1
he said leaving the @entity40 would be a ' great setback economically for @entity3 ' and warned that an in / out referendum would be a ' lottery ' which could result in the @entity3 severing ties with @entity68			0
he told the @entity112 : ' the @entity3 isolation party and their fellow travellers in the @entity20 are operating a @entity117 - style protection racket inside the @entity20			1
' blast : @entity18 former cabinet minister @entity103 called @entity2 the ' @entity3 isolation party ' and said leaving the @entity40 would be a ' great setback ' for @entity3 he added : ' they are saying do what we want , give us what we are demanding or we are going to burn your home down			1
' in my view the prime minister has got to say enough is enough , you guys have got to clear off , take your tanks off my lawn , i am going to lead this party and govern this country in the way that serves its true economic national interest and i 'm going to do so without being bullied around by a bunch of people whose only interest is to be separate from @entity88 but not to create the prosperity for @entity3 and the trade and other economic opportunities by staying within @entity88 and its single market			0
' he said @entity18 was right not to offer an in / out vote ' just for the sake of having a referendum '			0
on today ’s @entity150 on @entity151 , @entity20 mp @entity149 supports the idea of a conservative / @entity2 electoral deal			0
she said : ' @entity154 suggested we should do this with the @entity21 a year ago and he got promoted to be a minister , so i ’m not sure why anybody thinks when i suggest it with @entity2 that anything would happen other than that			0
i ’m looking forward to my promotion			0
' conservative mp @entity163 told the programme : ' what i want to see is a conservative majority government			0
but i think talking about a coalition with anyone is actually self - defeating in attaining that objective			0
' we are representing a very proud party with a distinguished history and i find it really quite lily - livered if any @entity20 should be opening talks about pacts at this stage			0

support for the @entity3 @entity2 has reached a record 19 per cent
both @entity18 and the @entity64 losing ground , according to poll results
