in your prime , older , @entity3 , happier by @entity5 @entity5 confronts the grim choice between the bonkers @entity9 look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative the question of what it means to get older is endlessly discussed in the media , yet it remains strangely uncharted territory			1
there are plenty of novels on the subject — mostly rather autumnal in tone — and a plethora of off - putting books on the menopause			1
but when it comes to ideas on how to make the best of the second bit of life , there is a curious dearth of inspiration			1
how to escape the curse of the elasticated waistband , not to mention the grim choice between the bonkers @entity9 look of startled fixity or the equally unappealing wrinkly alternative ? what are the rules of dating at 50 ? and how do you keep your sanity when you are menopausal , your teenage children have taken up shoplifting and / or underage drinking and your parents are losing their marbles ? having written books on dieting , shopping and thrift , the columnist @entity5 has decided to explore what she encouragingly calls the prime of life			1
‘ this is a book designed to function as a sort of manual , ’ she writes			1
it ’s got advice about bras and @entity9 and advice about ailing parents , care homes and dementia			1
it tells you what make - up to buy and how to be a better step - parent			2
she covers middle - aged sex and dating and lots of other topics , too , in similar forthright fashion — from what to wear ( navy , apparently			1
@entity80 possibly not all at the same time ) to surviving the menopause , and how to be a good friend to someone who is ill ( alas , the prime of life is also the moment when what a friend of mine calls @entity85 starts tuning up with a vengeance )			1
she begins with @entity87 or , as the sub-heading cheerily has it , ‘ navigating the passage from nymph to nana ’			2
this is an excellent place to start , because the great conundrum of middle age ( as of that other transitional stage , adolescence ) , is that suddenly you do n’t know who you are			2
your previous certainties are thrown into confusion as the clothes , make - up and hair styles that have helped you present a confident face to the world for the past three decades now look bizarrely wrong			2
@entity5 tackles this intractable problem with an engaging mixture of ribaldry and sage advice — urging the supreme importance of taking good care of one ’s teeth , hair and feet as one advances towards old age			1
£ 18k is the average amount a woman spends on her face in a lifetime this is not , it must be said , a book for those trying to keep their end up on a budget			2
the pages are filled with variations on the theme of ‘ prices are , as you ’d expect , not cheap ’			2
but even if you ca n’t afford the @entity137 haircut , the £ 250 dental bleaching treatment or the @entity140 moisturiser , it ’s worth reading on			0
for a writer so exhilaratingly worldly , @entity5 has an unexpectedly bracing streak of common sense and an even more surprising emphasis on kindness			1
the more ghastly the situation , the more strongly she insists on good behaviour			0
let it gooooo , ’ she urges in her section on divorce			0
‘ all the bad / mad / annoying things are in the past			0
the only person you ’re harming by harping on about them is you — and , if you do it within their earshot , your children			0
’ author @entity5 she has a fund of equally sensible advice on dealing with teenage children , stepchildren and frail parents			1
( though given her @entity166 bust - up with her former chum , @entity167 of this parish , it is predictable that her views should be considerably tougher when it comes to culling friends whose sell - by date is past			0
) ‘ some people mature like wine ... and some turn to vinegar , i ’m afraid , causing you to want to spit them out , ’ she writes			0
k night is tremendously opinionated , but there is something strangely comforting about her robust certainty			0
reading her book is like having a conversation with a fearfully bossy but beloved old chum			0
you may disagree with her views on the wrongness of @entity189 , or feel irritated by her relentless plugging of unfeasibly expensive @entity192 beds			0
but just as you ’re about to lose patience , she comes out with something so funny or endearing or just plain right ( ‘ the supreme importance of an excellent funeral ’ , for example ) , that you ca n’t help but forgive her			0
and when it comes to living well , taking care of your teeth , being kind to your loved ones and wearing leopard skin in moderation is pretty good advice at any age .			0
