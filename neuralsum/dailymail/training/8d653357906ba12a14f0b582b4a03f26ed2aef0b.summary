by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the story of an exasperated @entity4 executive who , frustrated by the legendary @entity6 's reluctance to stray from his defensive domain , remarked ' tell the @entity8 to get his ass up front and score some goals ' , might possibly be the stuff of urban myth ; a tall tale invented to mock @entity16 's ignorance of what they call soccer			1
the one about the @entity22 sports reporter who cried foul because the @entity22 had to play both @entity23 and @entity24 on the same day in @entity26 qualifying , sadly , is not			0
that was in 1989 when @entity29 's goal in @entity30 sent the @entity22 through to their first finals in 40 years			2
optimistically they called it ' the shot heard round the world ' but , in truth , there was little genuine interest even in their own country			2
the @entity42 had folded four years earlier , taking the star - studded cosmos with it , and soccer faced a bleak future			1
this summer the @entity22 national team 's progress in the @entity26 in @entity62 has sparked unprecedented interest among the @entity22 public , while @entity69 clubs have been beating a path stateside like never before			1
@entity71 were here for the first time in 25 years and there is already talk of both @entity76 clubs coming back next summer			2
a sell - out crowd of 109,000 watched @entity50 's game against @entity51 in @entity49 and despite the pitch problems @entity82 encountered in @entity83 , there is no doubting the club 's belief in this most valuable of markets			1
@entity82 's @entity22 brand @entity87 will launch in the burgeoning @entity88 next year			2
they will soon be followed by a new @entity90 team owned by @entity91 , whose move to @entity93 in 2007 made the world sit up and take notice of @entity88			1
' it 's not a promise any more , it 's a reality , ' says @entity82 chief executive @entity99			2
' no matter how you look at it , soccer is the no.1 global sport and there is no reason for it not to be growing in the @entity22 – i think it 's unstoppable			1
' ' @entity108 was telling me that only five years ago he could walk on the street in @entity110 and nobody would recognise him			1
' @entity108 and @entity112 are @entity110 's star signings			1
a third ' designated player ' is allowed by a league still treading cautiously , anxious to avoid the lavish folly of the @entity42			2
no - one is kidding themselves that @entity108 and @entity119 would have considered coming here at the height of their careers			1
but the days when star players from @entity125 and @entity16 – @entity126 , @entity6 and @entity127 – could enjoy an easy pay - day at the end of their careers are in the past			1
centre of attention : @entity112 has become @entity87 's first ever signing friends reunited : @entity135 greets former player @entity136 on @entity71 's first tour of the @entity22 @entity138 speaking before the daunting match vs @entity140 ' all the players are well aware that this is n't a retirement league , ' said @entity110 's director of football @entity144			1
' in saying that , i 'm waiting for some of these big players who want to come who are n't looking for the money			0
' the business model of the old @entity42 did n't work and that 's why the league collapsed			1
@entity88 has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace			0
we need to continue to be mindful of our growth but we 're ready to take the next step			0
' progress has been built on the popularity of youth soccer , a football - mad @entity165 population ( up from 14million in the days of the @entity42 to 55m now ) , and massively increased media coverage of the sport			1
soccer is increasingly prominent on the television screens dotted around bars across @entity16			0
curiously , one in downtown @entity173 last week was showing a re-run of last season 's @entity175 between @entity177 and @entity178 on the big screen			0
these days , almost every @entity181 game can be watched live on the @entity182			2
' it 's like being locked in a candy store , ' says veteran @entity110 soccer writer @entity185			1
' there is no stopping the sport now			0
when the @entity42 went out of business , i feared it would be difficult for big - time soccer at that level to come back			1
i would never have predicted what we have here today			0
' we 've come a long way : the sport has developed since @entity6 played for the @entity4 next generation : @entity198 legend @entity108 will start his career in the @entity88 next season driven by an ambition to tap into the massively profitable @entity22 sports market , obligated by sponsorship deals like @entity50 's £ 355m partnership with car giant @entity206 , and attracted by first - class sports facilities , nine @entity181 clubs have played in @entity16 this summer			1
it 's not only the soccer hotspots of @entity210 , @entity110 and @entity211 either			1
the @entity212 brought @entity82 here to @entity214 , @entity215 to @entity216 and @entity50 to @entity217			1
@entity218 pitched up in @entity219 and @entity220 , @entity83			0
as the last of them arrived home on tuesday , they leave behind a country still dizzy on a @entity26 high that saw @entity227 's team qualify from a group including @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			2
they only lost by a single goal to the eventual world champions before going out with all guns blazing against @entity236 , and afterwards president @entity237 called captain @entity238 and goalkeeper @entity239 to offer his congratulations			0
glove affair : @entity239 's heroics against @entity236 were even recognised by @entity22 president @entity237 there is still much work to be done ; many people to convince and convert			1
but it appears that football has finally established a foothold on the @entity22 sports landscape			0
even the @entity4 are back , albeit in a reduced capacity			2
' soccer has grown in popularity and it exploded at the @entity26 , ' says @entity88 executive vice-president @entity253			0
' it captured the hearts and minds of the @entity22 public like never before			0
this is truly a rising soccer nation and it 's ripe for @entity88 to take advantage			2
' in the past , if the person next to me on a plane asked what i do , they would say , ' when will soccer make it in the @entity22 ? '			0
this summer we passed that mark – that discussion wo n't take place in the future			0
' big draw : @entity50 played @entity215 in the final of he @entity212 , @entity275 @entity22 residents purchased 196,000 tickets for this summer ’s @entity26 before the tournament began			1
that was more than any other country apart from hosts @entity62 , and more than @entity282 , @entity231 and @entity283 combined			0
@entity88 has grown from 10 teams in 2004 to 19 this season			0
@entity286 and @entity110 will launch next year , @entity287 in 2017 and @entity91 ’s @entity90 franchise will raise the total to 23			1
of the current 19 teams , 15 play in stadiums built or renovated for soccer			0
@entity88 average attendance ranks third among @entity16 ’s professional sports leagues behind the @entity296 and @entity297 , and ahead of the @entity298 and @entity299			0
@entity88 has signed a new £ 330m eight - year television deal with @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 which is worth almost five times the current agreement with @entity182			2
that is still dwarfed by the new £ 23.5billion deal the @entity296 has signed with @entity22 networks to show @entity22 football over the same period			0
having failed to qualify for the @entity26 for 40 years before 1990 , the @entity22 has reached the last seven tournaments			0
only @entity309 , @entity62 , @entity231 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 have done the same			0
premier league teams in america this summer @entity71 - @entity110 @entity215 – @entity315 , @entity211 , @entity110 , @entity216 , @entity90 @entity82 – @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity110 , @entity214 @entity50 – @entity210 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity217 , @entity90 @entity119 – @entity320 , @entity321 @entity322 – @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 @entity326 – @entity211 , @entity327 , @entity328 @entity218 – @entity219 , @entity220 @entity329 – @entity330			1
