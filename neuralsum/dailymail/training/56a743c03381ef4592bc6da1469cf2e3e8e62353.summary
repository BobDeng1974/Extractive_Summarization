a scientist has ' remixed ' his version of the sound of the big bang in light of detailed new data gathered by a multi-million pound space probe			1
information beamed back from the @entity10 's Â£ 515m @entity9 space telescope has already seen physicists revise their estimates of the age of the universe			0
now one professor has used the @entity9 data to create an updated , ' high fidelity ' rendition of the sound of the early development of the universe more than 13billion years ago			1
scroll down for audio imprint : this image shows the afterglow created by the @entity26 - and now a professor has come up with a version of how it sounded @entity30 , a professor emeritus of the @entity31 , first created an audio version of the big bang using data from @entity36 's @entity35 ten years ago			2
professor @entity30 has now used the better quality @entity9 readings to create a new rendition			2
' the new frequency spectrum goes to much higher frequencies than did the @entity44 analysis , and therefore offers a more ' high - fidelity ' rendition of the sound of the @entity26 , ' the professor explained on his website			1
the physicist used the @entity9 mission analysis of the cosmic microwave background - radiation from around 400,000 years after the start of the universe - which turns the temperature variations of the @entity55 into angular frequency components or ' multipoles '			0
professor @entity30 pointed out that the actual big bang frequencies were far too low to have been heard by the human ear , so he scaled them up by a ' huge factor ' for his simulation , which represents the first 760,000 years of the universe			0
last month the @entity10 unveiled a portrait of the infant universe based upon the first 15 and a half months of data from the @entity9 space telescope			0
the data also set a new value for the rate at which the universe is expanding today , indicating that the age of the universe is 13.82billion years - 80million years older than previously thought			0
' high - fidelity ' : the @entity9 data goes to much higher frequencies than the old @entity44 analysis , the professor said @entity79 : listen to the ' high - fidelity ' rendition of the sound of the big bang			1

professor has updated his ' sound of the big bang ' in light of new data
@entity30 used detailed new readings from @entity9 *cosmology* probe
new in - depth analysis allows for more ' high - fidelity ' rendition of sound
