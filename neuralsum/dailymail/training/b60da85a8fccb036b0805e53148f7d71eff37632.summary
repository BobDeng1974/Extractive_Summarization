by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 13:28 est , 1 may 2012 as the race to be the next @entity2 mayor reaches its crucial final days , candidate @entity4 is facing embarrassing allegations that he earned up to £ 1.2million over the past three years , but still used a tax loophole to save more money			1
the figure is thought to be more than his rival current @entity2 mayor @entity9 , was earning at some points in recent years			2
it has been claimed that by funnelling his wages into his company , the @entity13 candidate may have paid as little as 18 per cent tax , which saved him up to £ 220,000 , according to @entity17 on the campaign trail : mr @entity19 earlier today in @entity2			2
in the run up to thursday 's @entity23 elections , it is an embarrassing revelation for mr @entity4 , who has previously named tax avoiders as ' rich b * * * * * * s ' crucial week : @entity4 walks his dog @entity29 as he meets voters - a poll shows mr @entity9 is beating him by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run - off the allegations could leave the mr @entity4 red - faced as three years ago he criticised tax avoiders , saying : ‘ these rich b * * * * * * s just do n’t get it			1
no one should be allowed to vote in a @entity41 election , let alone sit in @entity33 , unless they pay their full share of tax			2
’ the figure which emerged last night is significantly higher than the £ 50,000 it was previously thought he had saved - some of the money was earned from personal appearances , speech making and hosting a radio show			0
it is an entirely legal move , but has still proved controversial			0
it was paid into a personal company set up by mr @entity4 and @entity52 , his then partner who is now his wife			1
the pair are sole shareholders in their company , @entity56 because @entity58 is a small firm , it does not legally have to spell out its income and outgoings			0
in contrast , @entity9 paid the top rate , which was pushed up to 50 per cent in april 2010			2
rivals : @entity2 mayor @entity9 campaigning in @entity65 , @entity66 , today in the final few days before the election every second counts : although it was raining when mr @entity9 left for work this morning , it had cleared up when he visited @entity65 this afternoon			1
after yesterday 's gaffe when he swore live on @entity72 lunchtime news , mr @entity9 was keen to impress @entity58 is a small firm , so it is not legally obligated to detail its income and outgoings			1
the study of @entity58 ’s @entity81 declarations estimates it made £ 1,239,000 from 2008 - 09 to 2010 - 11 , reported the newspaper			0
over the three years , conservative candidate mr @entity83 declared £ 1,278,360 total earnings and paid £ 519,276 in tax			0
but accountants believe that mr @entity4 managed to pay significantly less , because he was charged corporation tax			1
accounts : the money was paid into a personal company set up by mr @entity4 and @entity52 , his then partner who is now his wife accountant @entity92 told @entity17 the ploy had saved £ 65,000 in 2009 - 10 alone — meaning a tax rate of just 22 per cent			1
today a spokesman for mr @entity4 defended him and said to the @entity96 : ' he has paid all his taxes			1
what londoners want to know is how they will be better off , which is why he ’ll be cutting fares			0
@entity9 will hike fares above inflation			0
' a spokesman for mr @entity9 told the @entity96 : ‘ it has taken others to expose what @entity4 refused to release himself , despite promising to do so			1
‘ when you look at the tax rate he paid , which is so much less than the other candidates , and at the comments he has made in the past , it is no wonder he has been trying to hide the truth about his tax affairs			0
‘ how can @entity98 trust him as mayor when he has been caught out again saying one thing and doing another ? ’ the revelations angered the @entity116 who said : ' @entity4 is a hypocrite , he criticised tax avoiders but it seems he has now been caught out himself			1
he promised voters that he would publish full details of his tax affairs over three weeks ago but has yet to deliver , it ’s hard to see how @entity98 can trust him on any of his other promises			0
' both candidates are under pressure to succeed from their respective parties in thursday 's elections , and yesterday mr @entity9 launched a foul - mouthed rant at a tv interviewer			1
the @entity132 incumbent , who opened up a 12 - point lead in a new poll , let rip on camera after a @entity72 journalist questioned him about his links to the @entity139 media empire			0
time for a change ? the candidates speak during a live @entity143 debate at @entity144 , @entity2 on track ? @entity4 is known for taking the tube in @entity2 , but could it be that @entity4 is no gentleman and does not give his seat up for a lady ? getting on famously : @entity9 and @entity4 at the @entity151 in central @entity2 in a sign of the pressure he is under , mr @entity9 described the line of questioning as ‘ f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * ’			1
he got a major boost last night when a @entity160 poll for the @entity151 showed him opening up a sizeable lead over his @entity13 rival and former mayor @entity4 after a week in which the contest had seemed on a knife - edge			2
the poll showed mr @entity9 beating mr @entity4 by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run - off			1
but mr @entity9 lost his famous sense of humour after facing questions about attempts to secure commercial deals with @entity173 while @entity174 was probing phone hacking by the company			2
@entity177 above : @entity4 at @entity178 in south @entity2 where he and @entity13 leader @entity179 toured small businesses and met local people left behind : @entity4 and the @entity179 campaigning together in @entity182 the major battlegrounds.jpg mr @entity9 asked the @entity184 ’ firm to sponsor a @entity186 cable car in @entity187 while he was chairman of the @entity188			1
at the time , the force was investigating the firm over phone @entity191 told the @entity72 : ‘ i do n’t know of any discussions going on about that but what i can tell you is that i think it ’s right to work with the private sector to get contributions that will be for the benefit of @entity2			0
’ he then urged the @entity72 to concentrate on the money he has raised during his term of office from the private sector , rather than questions raised by @entity207 political editor @entity206			0
he said : ‘ i ’m very proud that over the last four years we ’ve got more than £ 100million in sponsorship that i ’ve raised for this city : £ 50million for the bikes , £ 36million for the cable car			0
‘ you ’ve got to get this on the air ! come on , this is the most important thing			0
@entity217 and his f * * * * * * b * * * * * * *			2
’ the swearing was broadcast on the @entity72 lunchtime news .			0

in the run up to thursday 's @entity226 election , it is an embarrassing revelation for mr @entity4 , who called tax avoiders ' rich b * * * * * * s '
a poll shows mr @entity9 is beating mr @entity4 by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run - off
