guessing the royal baby ’s name has quickly become one of the nation ’s favourite pastimes			1
@entity5 and @entity6 became the favourites at the bookies last night , after hundreds of thousands of pounds were staked on the possibilities			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 were the next most betted - on choices			1
yesterday , mug and tea - towel makers were poised to go into production the moment the name is announced			0
it is also likely that unofficial @entity39 accounts , @entity41 pages and even ‘			0
com ’ internet addresses bearing the baby ’s name will spring up immediately			2
the waiting game could go on for some time			0
when prince @entity24 arrived in 1982 , his parents took seven days to decide what to call him			0
@entity49 : the @entity50 and @entity23 left hospital last night a day after @entity23 gave birth @entity53 : @entity23 wore a blue polka - dot dress as she faced the world 's media with her baby for the first time princess @entity59 was thought to have argued for @entity60 and @entity61 , while @entity62 reportedly had his heart set on @entity64 or @entity14			1
the @entity50 and @entity23 have 42 days to register their son ’s birth , but are unlikely to take that long			1
@entity67 , editor of @entity68 , said : ‘ i think the @entity69 quite like to do things slowly			0
‘ it ’s quite dignified to have a bit of breathing space between the birth and the announcement of the name			1
it ’s a measured approach			0
‘ but the @entity50 and @entity23 seem very organised			1
i would be surprised if it took them longer than a week			0
’ royals : the baby is likely to be given a traditional name , but will probably not be named after his grandfather @entity62 grandparents : but @entity84 insisted that she and @entity85 had not given advice on the name @entity88 and @entity62 are seen as unlikely first names , but could be suitable as middle names			2
so could @entity85 , should @entity23 wish to honour her father			1
another possible middle name is @entity93 , a recurring moniker in @entity23 ’s family tree			1
it is both her father and her grandfather ’s middle name and @entity100 was her great - great - great grandmother ’s first name			0
it was also princess @entity59 ’s middle name , meaning @entity24 could honour his mother ’s memory through his son if he chose its masculine form			0
the @entity108 will be informed of the chosen names prior to their announcement , but is unlikely to wield a veto			2
odds : bookmakers have been taking bets on the name of the royal baby for several months announcement : the birth of the new prince was officially announced on an easel outside @entity121 royal writer @entity122 said : ‘ @entity108 is so down to earth that she ’s not likely to jump up and down and say this boy has got to be called @entity62 and @entity5			1
‘ this is n’t going to be , “ @entity126 , do you approve ? ” but more “ these are the names we ’ve chosen - do you like them ? ” ‘ it ’s much more of a personal thing these days			0
’ great - great - grandfather : the last king called @entity5 was @entity134 , the current @entity108 's father 1 ) @entity5 ( 7/4 ) meaning : ‘ @entity135 ’ @entity5 is a popular modern choice , and there have been six previous reigning @entity138			1
for this reason , the name @entity5 would be seen as a ‘ safe ’ choice , symbolising the continuity of the monarchy			1
it was the @entity145 name of the @entity108 ’s beloved father , @entity134 , and is also one of prince @entity62 ’s middle names			0
even @entity88 - who abdicated the throne - had @entity5 among his seven names			1
but there are also reasons for thinking the bookies ’ favourite may not be the royals ’ first choice			2
@entity158 social historian dr @entity157 speculated : ‘ royal advisers are likely to point out that the 19th century @entity5 of @entity160 was not exactly a model that @entity23 and @entity24 would wish the new prince to emulate			1
‘ he was not popular with his cousin @entity164 , especially after he married an actress who was the mother of four children by three different fathers			0
’ in the @entity170 television comedy @entity168 , @entity5 was a childish , spoiled , bumbling foppish fool who spent money extravagantly			1
precedent : @entity173 was also @entity173 of @entity174 and could provide inspiration 2 ) @entity6 ( 4/1 ) meaning : ‘ he who supplants ’ the name @entity6 has strong royal ties , with two @entity180 kings bearing the name			1
it was also the name of six @entity174 kings , so could prove popular north of the border - something to bear in mind as the @entity188 debate rages			0
but @entity24 already has a cousin called @entity6 - the @entity190 and @entity192 ’s son @entity191 - and it is the name of his brother - in - law			2
@entity23 , who is close to her brother @entity6 , may feel that having one in the family is enough			1
3 ) @entity10 ( 7/1 or 8/1 ) meaning : ‘ protector of men ’ this would be another one popular in @entity174 , where @entity10 was regarded as one of the country ’s greatest rulers			2
a prince @entity10 would inevitably be nicknamed @entity205 after the ancient @entity207 legend			2
in april this year , @entity208 was sworn in as @entity20 after the abdication of his mother , queen @entity210			0
consolation prize ? the baby could be named after his uncle , prince @entity213 4 ) @entity11 ( 12/1 ) meaning : ‘ rules his household ’ a flurry of last - minute bets slashed the odds on @entity11 from 50/1 at @entity218 in the 48 hours leading up to the birth			2
it is prince @entity213 ’s full first name , and would pay a brotherly homage to @entity24 ’s best man - plus serve as a consolation prize after the newborn pushed @entity213 into fourth place in the line of succession			0
@entity180 ’s most famous @entity11 was @entity229 , who married six times and set up the @entity231 to split from the @entity232			0
5 ) louis ( 12/1 ) meaning : ‘ famous warrior ’ this name has deep significance in the @entity237 family in honour of the @entity62 ’s favourite uncle lord @entity239 , who was killed by the @entity240 in 1979			0
louis is the last of @entity24 ’s three middle names .			0

@entity18 is on *tenterhooks* as nation waits for announcement of baby 's name
@entity5 and @entity6 are bookies ' favourites with @entity10 and @entity252
