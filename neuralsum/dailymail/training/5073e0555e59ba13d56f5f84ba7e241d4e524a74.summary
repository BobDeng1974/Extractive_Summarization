but he later received a £ 100 fined for overstaying the 90 minute maximum free parking			1
the furious pensioner - who would visit @entity22 six times a week - refused to pay and the fine was doubled with @entity7 's citing ' court costs '			1
mr @entity9 , who has diabetes , said : ' i bought a @entity8 – a burger , chips and white coffee – and after eating it , i sat in my car listening to @entity34 and dozed off			1
' i often get up early when i ’ve got a lot of work on and would have an early meal because it ’s good value and sets me up for the rest of the day			0
' i thought i had just dropped off for a minute , i do that in the car when it ’s hot			2

however , the firm said it had since cleared his fine			0
it is unclear whether he is still liable to pay the extra £ 100 court costs added to the amount			1
a spokesman for the company said : ' in instances where a customer feels that a parking charge notice has been issued in error , we ask that they follow the procedure outlined by the ticket issuer to make an appeal			0
' it is with regret that in this case the customer did not appeal the charge notice and did not respond on the several occasions he was sent notifications by the ticket issuer on this matter			0
' we were therefore unaware of his case until court action had been taken			0
“ the fine has since been cleared and we have informed the customer that should the situation arise again he must contact the ticket issuer to appeal it			0
