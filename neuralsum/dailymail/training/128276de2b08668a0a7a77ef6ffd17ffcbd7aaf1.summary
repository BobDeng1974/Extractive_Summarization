by @entity1 reporter @entity3 ’s least used railway station recorded just eight passengers last year			2
the total for @entity7 station , is even lower than the previous year , when 14 people passed through it			1
there are just two trains a week , on sundays – the minimum required by law to avoid closure			1
not needed : less than 10 passengers passed through @entity7 in 2013			1
there are just two trains a week - both of which arrive on a sunday so remote and underused is the @entity7 station that even the local airport 's website ignores it - despite it being less than a mile from the terminal			1
the airport claims that : ' @entity24 is the nearest train station to @entity25 , located just 7 miles away			0
' a @entity27 spokesperson said : ' the parliamentary service which calls at @entity25 station is one which is specified in our franchise agreement			0
' the line between @entity33 and @entity34 has attracted a growing number of passengers over recent years , however the airport station on the route , has not enjoyed the same success			2
' forgotten : just two trains stop at @entity7 station a week - the minimum required by law			1
both of the trains are on a sunday ' we support proposals to relocate the station , as part of the wider @entity52 development , to better serve the needs of rail / air passengers , ' the spokesperson added			1
' we are already working with partners involved on initial stages of the scheme including the opening of a new station at the @entity60 and improvements at other stations on the route			0
' the station , which was opened in 1971 , has two platforms			0
when the airport changed its name in 2004 to @entity25 , the station 's name remained the same			0
the neglect of so many of @entity3 's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under - served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains			2
it is easier for train operating countries to run ' zombie ' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly , as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process .			0
