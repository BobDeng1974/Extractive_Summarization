by @entity0 published : 21:50 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 5 february 2013 if you think there ’s something a little fishy about one of the penguins in the picture below , you ’re not wrong			1
because the bird on the right is n’t a real penguin at all , but a hi - tech robot with camera lenses hidden in its eyes			1
award - winning filmmaker @entity14 used ‘ penguin - cams ’ to infiltrate colonies of @entity17 and emperor penguins in @entity18 – and obtain stunning shots of never - before - seen behaviour			1
it was also used to ‘ lay ’ an ‘ egg - cam ’ , which successfully captured charming images of a six - week - old chick peering into it through natural curiosity			2
mr @entity14 used an array of 50 spy cameras , the most advanced of which cost up to £ 100,000 , to film penguins in @entity18 , the @entity43 and @entity44			1
they included an ‘ egg - cam ’ , an underwater ‘ @entity32 ’ and a ‘ toboggan - cam ’ , a full - sized @entity50 model which can join a group of real birds by slithering in on its stomach – in fact a motorised sledge			2
mr @entity14 said : ‘ we also employed an underwater ‘ penguin - cam ’ so that we could follow these amazing creatures in their mission to find a safe place to nest and raise the chicks			1
‘ in @entity18 , the emperors brave treacherous sea ice and a trek across the ice of up to 100 miles before huddling together to survive 90mph winter blizzards			2
we were with them all the way			2
‘ in some of the most moving scenes , we filmed the plight of females who had failed to find a mate or had lost their eggs			1
' we witnessed single females doing their best to break up couples by physically disrupting them during mating			2
later , alone and without young of their own , they would resort to chick - napping			2
‘ we also recorded evidence of the devotion of penguin pairs who had matched and mated			0
and extraordinary close - ups that showed how emperor mothers flick their tail feathers to catch the newly laid egg and stop it touching the snow			0
’ @entity14 's toboggan - cam ' : a fake emperor penguin that is self - powered and slithers into midst of colony ‘ in the 35 years i have been making wildlife films i have never seen or captured so much extraordinary new behaviour on any animal			1
we have never got closer to any subject			0
' mr @entity14 has previously used ‘ boulder - cams ’ hidden in mock rocks to film lions , ‘ plop - cams ’ disguised as jumbo dung to film elephants , ‘ tusk - cams ’ attached to @entity99 elephants to film tigers and an ‘ @entity101 ’ to follow polar bears through the drifting @entity104 ice floes			1
there were casualties among the robots , however			0
three ‘ egg - cams ’ vanished in a blizzard			0
a ‘ @entity32 ’ was attacked by a rockhopper and had its head taken off			0
in @entity44 , an underwater ‘ @entity32 ’ was attacked by sealions that bit off a flipper			0
his team filmed 1,000 hours of intimate behaviour over 300 consecutive days , the longest ever shoot of emperors ever made producer @entity126 said : ‘ the animatronic devices we used might appear quirky , cute or sometimes comical but they had a real purpose			1
‘ we used the very latest robotic technology to mimic the birds ’ behaviour , helping us to fit right into penguin life			0
‘ in @entity44 , for instance , the penguins are super-nervous of humans			1
if they spot you from 100 metres away they panic and run			0
but our penguin - cam was able to infiltrate the colony without ruffling a feather			0
‘ all our different spy cameras enabled us to get closer to the penguin families than ever before and to capture behaviour never seen before			1
we got some extraordinary footage			1
’ the remarkable results can be seen in @entity24 – spy in the huddle			0
the @entity149 documentary is narrated by former doctor who star @entity150 and will be screened over three weeks starting on monday , february 11 at 9pm .			0
