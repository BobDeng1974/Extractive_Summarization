by @entity0 last updated at 7:13 pm on 6th august 2011 this is certainly not something you see every day			2
a baseball fan dressed in a green @entity6 suit ran onto the pitch during a game in @entity9 , @entity10 , and managed to wrestle , sprint and slide his way to escape from six security men in pursuit			2
he made his exit via a large door at the back of the field - which was being held open by a yellow @entity20 man , who promptly shut it in the faces of the onrushing staff			1
' it came at the top of the fifth innings of a match between @entity46 and @entity47 , two collegiate summer baseball teams			0
first , the fan takes everyone by surprise by leaping from the stands and running across the field arms flailing			0
first obstacle : the @entity20 man comes up against two security men and decides to dart to the left floored : an older member of staff hauls the @entity20 man to the ground - but he rolls over and gets out of his grasp then , he charges towards staff when they come to stop him and it looks like his fun is over as he is wrestled to the ground			1
but despite four officials surrounding the masked man , he manages to push one away and makes a dash for the far fence			2
one shove and away : the lycra - clad individual pushes a staff member and makes a dart for the back of the field out - paced : the ground 's security staff fail to keep up with the anonymous prankster @entity80 : one security man goes for a slide tackle in the wet conditions but fails to grab @entity20 man 's heels as he sprints away , attempts at slide tackles are poorly timed and even a sixth security man ca n't keep pace with the prankster			1
but with seemingly nowhere to go , his chances of escape do n't look good			0
that is until a large door at the back of the field , used for bringing in batting cages , is opened by his accomplice dressed in a yellow @entity20 man costume			1
to the rescue : the green @entity20 man has help in the shape of a yellow @entity20 man , who holds open the door used to bring batting cages onto the field slammed shut : the yellow @entity20 man completes the stunt by locking in the staffers they exchange a high five as the green @entity20 man runs out and the stunt is complete when the door , which locks from the outside , is slammed shut in the staff members ' faces			1
another @entity36 user posted : ' i watched this from the duck blind ( the stadium 's main stand ) and could n't stop laughing ! ' @entity46 president @entity121 told @entity122 he had never seen anything like it before and said he thought is could be an former employee with knowledge of how the door works			0
mr @entity121 said : ' our staff are kind of perplexed			0
we 're used to having people on the field but usually they are drunk so easy to handle			0
' there was a similar stunt days later when the green man escaped by climbing up a rope ladder dropped down over the far wall by his yellow accomplice .			1
