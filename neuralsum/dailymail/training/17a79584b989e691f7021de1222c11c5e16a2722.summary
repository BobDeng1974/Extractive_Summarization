by @entity0 losing weight ahead of the big day has become a classic part of being a bride with 96 per cent of women admitting to going on a diet ahead of their wedding			2
but for @entity11 , 38 , from the @entity12 , her bid to lose weight before her big day left her in agony after a bungling surgeon cut through her bowel during gastric bypass surgery			1
three years and seven operations later , the open wound on her stomach has still not healed and ms @entity11 remains unmarried			1
upsetting : @entity11 had to postpone her wedding after a bungled gastric bypass left her in agony damage : @entity11 's stomach still has a gaping wound and oozes revolting fluids ' i just wanted to be healthy so that we could enjoy our lives together , ' says ms @entity11 of the decision that led to the disastrous operation			1
' [ @entity31 ] said he would support me in whatever i wanted to do			1
i thought this is the turning point , this is the start of my new life			0
' with three months to go before her wedding to her fiance @entity31 , she paid Â £ 7,000 for a private gastric bypass operation in a bid to slim down			1
but it only took 24 hours before she began to feel unwell			0
' they found that during the first operation , the surgeon had accidentally cut my bowel , ' she remembers			0
although the hospital wheeled her straight back into the operating theatre to fix the damage , less than two weeks later , she had to be rushed to @entity50 after her stitches split , leaving her with a deep hole that oozed infection			1
' three years down the line , and i 've had eight operations in total - seven to repair the damage from the initial cut , ' she reveals			0
during her last operation , surgeons connected her stomach to an external drain to draw off the pus from the continuing infection			1
' the pipe is attached to a drain which goes into my stomach and the fluid from the wound is sucked out and goes into the machine , ' she explains			2
' i have to carry it everywhere with me , i have to shower with it , sleep with it ... everything gets done with this machine			0
' ghastly : @entity11 is permanently attached to a drain that draws away fluids created by the infection inside hope : @entity11 says she 's trying to focus on a happier future with her fiance and her wedding the infection and resulting hole have also damaged her relationship with ms @entity11 saying that any form of physical contact - even a simple hug - leaves her in pain			1
' i do n't like him [ @entity31 ] touching my stomach at all , ' she explains			2
' it 's awful for him because he just wants to give me a hug			0
' i wish i could allow him to give me the hugs and the closeness i so desperately want but i feel so uncomfortable			0
' in spite of her injury , ms @entity11 and her fiance have now set a new date for the wedding and she hopes a solution to her stomach will be found before she walks down the aisle			1
' when i get really down and really low , i keep looking at my dress , thinking " i know this is going to be one of the best days of my life " , ' she explains			0
' because of the lumps in my stomach and because i 'm attached to this machine , i ca n't actually get in my dress at the moment - it 's too tight			0
she adds : ' i 'm just trying to focus on my future with my fiance and on our wedding			0
' @entity11 appears on @entity116 : brides , thursday at 10pm on @entity118			2
