by @entity0 the pilot of a @entity3 jet that landed at the wrong airport near @entity5 , @entity6 in january only knew after he landed that he made the embarrassing error , newly released recordings show			1
' i assume i 'm not at your airport , ' the pilot radioed to the control tower at @entity16 in @entity17 the evening of jan. 12 , moments after the plane came to a stop at the end of the runway at @entity21 about six miles away			1
' @entity23 , have you landed ? ' the air traffic controller responded			0
after a short pause , the pilot replied , ' yeah			2
the controller was so baffled by the mistaken landing , he even called a colleague at @entity40 , @entity41 to tell him about it			0
' he says he landed at the wrong airport , ' the @entity5 controller said			1
' are you kidding , ' the @entity40 colleague replied			0
' no , i 'm not , ' the @entity5 controller responded			1
an aerial view of the runway at @entity16 an aerial view of the runway at @entity21 flight 4013 , a @entity51 carrying 124 passengers , left @entity54 and was supposed to land at @entity16 before continuing on to @entity55			1
as the pilots were in final approach to the airport , air traffic controllers told them they were about 15 miles away			0
the pilots then said they had the airport in sight , though what they thought was @entity16 was actually @entity21 , an airfield that has one runway with a length of just 3,738 feet			1
by comparison , the @entity16 runway is 7,140 feet long			1
although the @entity5 controller cleared the @entity23 jet for a visual approach , it also meant the pilots were not using the aircraft 's navigation system to ensure the correct orientation			2
the pilots later told the @entity76 they mistook @entity21 as @entity16 since both runways are oriented in a similar direction and have bright lights			1
@entity80 , a passenger on the plane , said at the time that he smelled burned rubber after the landing			0
the aircraft ended up near the end of the runway			2
a cliff is not far away			0
the terminal at @entity16 where passengers on @entity90 expected to land ' they came on and said , " ladies and gentlemen , ” we 've landed at the wrong airport , ’ @entity80 told @entity34 5			2
the passengers were eventually bused to @entity16 and @entity23 flew in another plane to take the remaining passengers onto @entity35			2
the captain and first officer involved in the flight remain on paid leave			1
commercial aircraft landing at the wrong airport is not that rare of an occurrence			0
in november 2013 , a specially configured @entity105 jumbo jet freighter known as a @entity106 was supposed to land at @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 to deliver parts used to manufacture the @entity111			0
instead , the plane landed nine miles away at colonel @entity113			0
a @entity3 @entity105 737 - 700 similar to the one that landed at the wrong airport in @entity6			0
