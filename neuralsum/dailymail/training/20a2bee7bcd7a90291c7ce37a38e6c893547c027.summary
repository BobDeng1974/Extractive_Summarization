@entity0 does not need to take a polygraph test to verify how much he is hurting after @entity4 ’s @entity3 exit			1
it is etched all over the striker ’s face as he talks about the need to put things right against @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity0 knows his emotional return to @entity12 this season , 17 years after he was rejected as a @entity4 trainee , has not been a triumphant homecoming so far			1
like the club ’s season in general , @entity0 is in the middle of an anguished spell , which reached its low point on tuesday night when he was substituted at half - time against @entity22 and forced to watch centre - back @entity23 operate as a target man in his absence			1
@entity0 accepts that his move to boyhood club @entity4 has not been a success @entity0 and @entity28 ( right ) look on after conceding during @entity3 elimination to @entity30 @entity4 players try and raise the spirits in training ahead of their clash with @entity10 to be fair to the 32 - year - old , he does not try to hide his pain , nor the team ’s , after a 1 - 1 draw that saw them eliminated from the elite competition and consigned to the @entity40			1
‘ the mood was down when we got back into training on thursday and we have been trying to get the spirits going again , put everything to bed and get fired up for the @entity10 game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ everyone in that dressing room is hurting just as much as me			2
‘ we ’ve just got to look forward to sunday now			2
obviously there ’s more pressure on us to get the win			2
if we ca n’t get up for this , we ca n’t get up for any game			2
’ it was not meant to be like this			2
@entity0 ’s £ 4million move from @entity58 was one of the feelgood stories of the summer			1
he was the @entity61 boy who left @entity4 at 15 to work in a beetroot factory and start a new playing career in the lower leagues with @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
the 32 - year - old 's form for @entity58 earned his a dream move to @entity12 in the summer @entity0 reacts after missing a chance against @entity73 , the @entity71 striker has only netted twice this term eventually , he ended up getting a fairytale move back to @entity4 as one of nine signings made by manager @entity78 to offset the loss of @entity80 to @entity81 in the summer			1
but the reality has well and truly kicked in now with @entity4 ’s top - four challenge faltering on a lack of goals , with @entity0 and @entity86 held chiefly responsible			1
@entity0 has scored just twice all season while @entity4 ’s leading @entity89 scorers — @entity90 and @entity28 — have managed only three goals apiece			1
to put those statistics into context , @entity80 hit four goals in one game against @entity96 last winter			2
‘ all those cliches and thoughts of living the dream quickly got eradicated a few months after i joined , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ just because i ’m a @entity4 fan does n’t mean it ’s nice when we ’re not playing or not winning			1
‘ it ’s hurting me personally and i have to try to get it out of my system			2
let me be a player			2
a few of us did n’t play that well on tuesday and we want to try to rectify it			0
’ losing @entity80 to @entity81 appears to have effectively ended @entity4 's hopes of a title challenge @entity86 may be smiling during training but the @entity114 firebrand has come under intense criticism the good news for @entity78 , also under pressure with many of his signings struggling , is that @entity0 has been here before			1
right at the start of his career , he signed for @entity66 from @entity65 in a £ 300,000 deal that represented a lot of money for the club , and scored only twice in 32 games in his first season there			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve had a lot of experiences that will help me			0
i ’ve always believed in my ability and that i can score goals			0
i ’m more than confident that i can start scoring			0
‘ i ’ve been doing well in the last month , though i did n’t have a good game the other night			0
i know i can do better			0
‘ as a team , i would n’t judge us too quickly			0
wait until @entity137 is back and all our signings have completely gelled , then judge us			0
i believe we will start going on a run			0
@entity0 hopes that his experience will get him through this lean spell in front of goal the @entity144 are missing main striker @entity86 who has been sidelined with a long - term injury ‘ common sense tells you if you ’re looking at an entirely new back four and an entirely new attacking line , it is mistaken to think we would carry on the same as last year or anywhere near it			1
it was always going to take time			0
’ as a boyhood fan , it is inevitable today ’s trip to @entity159 — regarded by @entity160 as the biggest match of the season — will be special			2
@entity0 was in the crowd when @entity10 won the 1996 fa cup final and @entity4 ’s players were dubbed ‘ @entity170 ’ for wearing white @entity167 suits as they strolled around @entity168 before kick - off			1
‘ it ’s a fixture i ’ve always watched			0
it ’s brilliant — the atmosphere , the intensity of the game , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s a lot of respect but a bit of hatred as well			0
‘ it ’s everything we want in a game			0
two good teams , two top clubs going head to head			0
i ’m looking forward to it			0
@entity28 celebrates scoring during @entity4 's 3 - 0 victory at @entity159 last season @entity0 recalls @entity191 's winner against his club in the 1996 fa cup final at @entity168 ‘ i went to @entity168 when @entity191 scored the winner			1
i ’ve been to a few at @entity12 as well but i ’m trying not to look at it as a fan any more			0
i ’ve got a job to do whether i ’m starting or on the bench			0
‘ we ’ve got to be very respectful of the attacking aspect of @entity10			1
they ’ve got one of the best in the country , but we ’ve got to feel confident that we can attack them , too			0
we ’re different as well so we ’ve got to go there with a game plan			0
’ last march , @entity4 beat @entity10 3 - 0 at @entity159			1
@entity0 , then a @entity58 player , recalls being ‘ animated ’ as he watched on television			1
this time the game means even more , as a player rather than a fan .			0
