by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 11 october 2013 most young men would be haunted for life by the sight of their mother having sex - the last thing they would want is a picture of it			0
but for @entity11 that image was such an inspiration that he decided to capture it on camera for the world to see in a series of photographs that @entity18 himself could only have dreamed of			1
the @entity21 artist has now sent shock waves through the art world after his collection explicit images of his mother , @entity26 , cavorting naked with an array of younger men was showcased as part of a new exhibition in @entity31			1
the @entity33 - based photographer , 36 , is showcasing the controversial series , many of which are too graphic to publish on this website , in a bid to redefine the perceived boundaries between mother and son			2
mother of art : this image is one of the less graphic pictures in the series , pretend you 're actually alive , and shows artist @entity11 in bed with his mother , @entity26 in one , the middle - aged woman stares confidently into the camera as she removes her underwear , her legs spread wide in a pose that leaves little to the imagination			1
another shows her laughing in bed as she cavorts naked with a younger lover to whom she appears to have tied herself with a belt			0
meanwhile , others need little explanation beyond their titles , such as the provocatively - named ' @entity63 ' and ' @entity64 * * * ing in @entity65 '			1
asked by @entity67 if he ever gets turned on when taking such pictures of his mother , the artist replied ambiguously : ' i do n't know what to say			1
' ' i think already in the background there were some foggy boundary issues			0
what people talk about as being oedipal – there 's a flirtation with that , but the boundaries were never actually crossed , ' he said			0
he says he gained inspiration for the series after returning home for christmas one year to be greeted by his mother in a most unusual manner			2
ambiguous : when asked if he ever gets turned on when taking such pictures of his mother , @entity33 - based @entity11 ( pictured ) replied ambiguously , ' i do n't know what to say ' ' i arrived home not having seen her for a year and a half , ' he recalls			1
' she knew i was coming and opened the door naked			0
' he said when he then entered the house and caught a glimpse into her bedroom , ' a young man , almost exactly my age , was sprawled out naked			0
he rolled over to see me , saying hello , before rolling back over and returning to sleep			0
' ' i had a camera and began making photos of her then , ' he added			0
' she was the catalyst			0
' the exhibition also includes extracts from his own adolescent diary entries ; ads @entity26 placed in the @entity113 for ' a generous , wealthy husband ( not someone else 's ) who wants his own private dancer ' ; as well as descriptions of her fraught relationship with her sons and former husband			1
as a teenager , @entity26 was a ballet prodigy , who danced for the @entity121 , but turned to stripping when her career ended prematurely			2
for seven years , @entity11 has been photographing her in her most intimate acts and attitudes , exploiting her need for recognition and her boundless and exhibitionist attitude			2
the pictures will be showcased in an exhibition @entity130 : photography , @entity132 – at the @entity133 in @entity31			1

@entity11 pictured mother @entity26 for series , pretend you 're actually alive
