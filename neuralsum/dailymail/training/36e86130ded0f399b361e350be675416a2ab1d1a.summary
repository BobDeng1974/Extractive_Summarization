a luxury car saleswoman has been hailed as one of the world 's best after it emerged she had sold more than £ 13million worth of @entity3 in a single year			1
@entity5 has sold 11 of the pricey vehicles in the past year at the exclusive @entity8 dealership where she works			1
most veyron salesmen consider themselves lucky to shift three of the supercars - which have a top speed of 267mph - in 12 months			1
but miss @entity5 seems to have the @entity13 - as well as selling ten @entity3 outright from the @entity15 dealership , she joined with a @entity17 firm to sell an eleventh			1
talented : @entity5 has managed to sell 11 @entity3 in the past year luxury : the @entity21 - born saleswoman is an expert at selling the super-luxury vehicles to wealthy clients but last night she told the @entity24 , just minutes after clinching her latest deal ( a @entity27 sold for an eye - watering £ 1.7million ) , that being a woman in a traditional man ’s world had not been a problem – indeed it can be a positive advantage			1
and even when male customers ask her to find a salesmen she says : ’ you have to take it as a joke and respond with charm			2
you ca n’t blame the customers			2
’ ' this can be cultural , but once they realise i know about the car it breaks down barriers			2
' the @entity21 - born sales mastermind 's outstanding efforts led to the boss of @entity3 sending her a special @entity53 card telling her she was their ‘ global benchmark ’ in sales			1
miss @entity5 works 24 hours a day dealing with @entity56 customers around the world , and goes to meet the customers in their home countries when the car keys are handed over			1
her amazing sales exploits are revealed today in @entity63 magazine			1
glamorous : the @entity27 is the fastest street car in the world with a top speed of 267mph on the way up : the 39 - year - old started working as an administrator at a @entity71 dealership but has now graduated to working with some of the most exclusive cars in the world with her £ 10million a year sales translated into dollars , she has already been nicknamed ‘ the $ 15million woman			1
’ she told @entity63 : ‘ we tend to have two types of customer - collectors and investors			1
‘ i like to start by talking to them about what cars they already have and their general interest			1
i 'm trying to find the car that matches their personalities			2
’ she attributes her success to her phenomenal networking skills , which she exercises by spending time with the super-wealthy at events such as the @entity92			2
but the commission on each car has not brought her trappings of great wealth – her company car is a modest black diesel @entity99 – and she lives unostentatiously in @entity100 : ‘ i do n't drive a @entity3 unfortunately			0
i have a diesel @entity99 which i love			0
' it is very understated and suits my lifestyle			0
but i would n’t say no if one were offered			0
’ the firm was founded 1909 in the @entity107 town of @entity108 , @entity109 – then a disputed part of the @entity111 until 1919 - by @entity113 - born designer and engineer @entity114			1
@entity115 declined after @entity114 ’s death on august 21 , 1947 , with manufacturing operations ending in 1952			0
several failed attempts followed over decades to revive the marque			0
in 1987 @entity113 entrepreneur @entity120 acquired the brand and created @entity123 sports saloon			0
owners included @entity126 world champion @entity125 , but the firm soon went into liquidation			1
@entity129 bought the brand in 1998 and @entity132 boss dr @entity131 led the drive to create a supercar fit for the 21st century			0
critics were equally impressed and astonished by scale of his ambitions			0
a small ‘ boutique ’ factory was set up in grounds of @entity114 ’s original home in @entity108 , next to his chateau , to hand - assemble the cars			1
under @entity129 in 2005 , and after a series of prototypes , @entity3 unveiled the small but immensely powerful two seater 8 - litre @entity147 with four - turbochargers and a price in excess of £ 1 million			1
about 80 cars are built a year – most are collected by their owners from the factory			1
the @entity154 has a top speed of 258mph , accelerates from rest to 60mph in 2.3 seconds , develops 1,200 brake horse power ( about the same as 12 ford @entity159 put together ) , will average just 16mpg and has massive @entity161 emissions of 539g/km			0
she and her bosses declined to talk income – save to say she was on a ‘ traditional ’ commission - based package			1
however , leading luxury car dealers suggest that a ‘ batting average ’ of around £ 100,000 a year would not be wide of the mark			2
this is calculated from the dealer ’s profit margin on each veyron of around £ 150,000 , and the salesman or saleswoman receiving around five per cent to 10 per cent of that profit			0
the exclusive hand - built cars are manufactured at a ‘ boutique ’ factory in the grounds of @entity3 founder @entity114 ’s former home at @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity107			1
' every customer is invited to the @entity108 factory in @entity107 , ' she said			0
' i like them to feel the history and culture of the car and the story behind it			0
while we 're at the factory they can go for a test drive with @entity195 , who will tell them about the car and talk them through it			0
' mr @entity195 is @entity3 ’s lead test driver and set the record 267mph top speed in a @entity27 in 2010			2
she studied languages and speaks fluent @entity107 and @entity204 – her childhood was spent growing up when @entity21 was still behind the communist @entity206			1
most of @entity5 's clients are from the @entity209 which sometimes makes communication between both parties difficult			1
@entity204 pose less of a problem			1
she moved to the @entity214 13 years ago to work as an administrator for @entity71 in @entity217 , @entity218			0
but her skill at sealing a deal quickly saw her move from @entity223 hatchbacks to @entity17 sports cars before she joined @entity15 in 2011 to sell @entity225			2
her boss @entity227 , general manager of the dealership , part of the giant @entity232 group , hand - picked her for the @entity3 job			1
he said : ' customers lover her			0
it ’s a big relationship job			0
she ’s put a little bit of magic into it			0
she understands the customers and puts them at ease			0
' she was quickly moved from @entity225 to @entity241 , which she describes as a ‘ piece of art ’ , adding : ‘ i always say there are two types of cars in this world - @entity241 and other cars			1
’ buyers considering a £ 1million supercar demand high levels of customer service			0
flash : most of the customers for the @entity256 tend to come from places such as the @entity209 and @entity204 success : miss @entity5 has been hailed as one of the world 's most successful @entity3 dealers ‘ i have some customers ringing me up at 2am asking about warranties – but they can call me any time , ’ she said			1
@entity264 - £ 1.25m @entity264 - £ 1.25m @entity264 - £ 1.25m @entity264 - £ 1.25m @entity265 - £ 1.5m @entity265 - £ 1.5m @entity265 - £ 1.5m @entity266 - £ 1.5m @entity27 - £ 1.4m @entity267 - £ 1.1m @entity268 ( 1200hp ) - £ 1.7m * prices are pre-tax @entity3 prices vary from around £ 1million to £ 2million each , depending on model , specification , extras , local taxes , and currency exchange rates			2
cars bought for use in the @entity214 , for instance , will carry 20 per cent vat			2
those bought for delivery to a tax haven may carry no tax at all			0
under @entity288 law , tax for cars – and luxury yachts - is paid in the country into which the vehicle is imported – not where it is purchased			1
she even goes to every handover - next time , she is heading to @entity294 - and believes that this is as important as the initial sell			2
but even once the car ’s handed over , her job is n’t finished : ' aftersales is key to ensuring customers keep coming back			0
' you should call the next day to see if they ’re enjoying it or have any questions			0
’ she explained : ' a child can sell a car once			0
we want to see them again			0
we have a @entity311 customer from three years ago and we still call to see if they ’re ok			0
' she ’d like to see more female buyers , too			0
there are currently four female @entity256 owners around the world – only one of whom is in the @entity214			2
when dealing with a customer she normally talks to them in the @entity15 boardroom , with its original walls and archive invoices from as early as 1928 – a 4.5 - litre @entity311 back then was £ 1,396			2
' we like to show them things like this as they are normally car enthusiasts anyway , ' she said			0
even once they ’ve taken delivery , owners can have their cars transported around the world			1
' when our customer in @entity294 comes to the @entity214 for the summer , we ’ll sort out getting his car here – and service it at the same time , ' miss @entity5 explained			1
and if any mechanical issues arise , @entity114 ’s master technicians take over			0
‘ we call them the flying doctors , ' she said			0
‘ there are four in the world , and they ’ll fly to you if you have a problem			2
’ miss @entity5 is hoping to beat her sales record in 2013 by hitting double figures			1
employer : miss @entity5 has worked for @entity15 in @entity8 since 2011			1

@entity5 is sales star of the @entity8 dealership where she works
travels around world delivering cars to clients in @entity209 and @entity204
the cars are the peak of luxury and can hit an eye - watering 267mph
