by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:42 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 11 september 2013 @entity2 today condemned education secretary @entity3 as an ' absolute disgrace ' after suggesting families become who use food banks have only their own ‘ decisions ' to blame			1
in angry exchanges in the @entity12 , the @entity10 leader challenged @entity13 to distance himself from the remarks			1
and he challenged the @entity16 frontbench to trying living on £ 150 - a - week			2
clash : @entity13 was challenged in the @entity10 leader @entity2 over the remarks by education secretary @entity3 earlier this week mr @entity3 argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials , including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘ to manage their finances ’			1
mr @entity2 said the remarks showed the government to be out - of - touch with the lives of ordinary people			1
in an increasingly bitter exchange , mr @entity2 said : ' here is the reality - you want to give maximum support to millionaires so you give them a tax cut			2
but it 's a different story for those who go to food banks			1
' and we know what this government thinks of people who go to food banks because the @entity44 ( mr @entity3 ) said that people who go to food banks only have themselves to blame			1
' as he faced a heckling from the government benches , mr @entity2 hit back : ' one of the @entity51 is groaning , it just shows how out of touch this @entity52 is			0
' he demanded to know if mr @entity13 agreed with mr @entity3 but did not get an answer			2
criticism : education secretary @entity3 said some families make the wrong decisions and get into financial trouble mr @entity2 went on : ' the prime minister neither defended the children 's secretary 's comments , nor distanced himself from them			1
let me just tell you , the children 's secretary is an absolute disgrace			0
' pointing at the @entity40 frontbench , he added : ' let 's see any of them try to live on £ 150 a week and then we will see what happens			0
' we have one million young people out of work , unemployment up in half the country , millions of people worse off while millionaires get a tax cut			2
for the few not the many , you are a two - nation prime minister			0
' but mr @entity13 said he did not have to take any lectures from @entity10 on food banks , telling mps their use increased 10 times under the last government			1
more than half a million people across @entity90 have turned to food banks to stave off hunger , according to charities			1
ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help			2
cuts to benefits , frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet			0
on monday mr @entity3 was challenged over reports that one in four parents are having to borrow to pay for school uniforms and some food banks were distributing uniforms to struggling parents			1
he said he had recently visited a food bank in his @entity116 constituency			0
but he suggested that many cash - strapped families have brought their problems on themselves			0
he added : ‘ i appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures			0
‘ those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances			0
‘ we need to ensure that support is not just financial , and that the right decisions are made			0
’ mr @entity3 was responding to a question from @entity10 frontbencher @entity132 who demanded to know ‘ what more can he and his government do to ensure that no students turn up to school embarrassed because they do not have the right clothes ’			0
demand : charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks , including this one in @entity144 run by @entity145 last night miss @entity132 said she was ’ appalled ’ by mr @entity3 ’s comments			1
the @entity10 @entity148 mp added : ’ people i have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks			1
’ i vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances			0
’ this government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by			0
’ citizens advice chief executive @entity159 said : ’ it is appalling to suggest the rise of food banks is due to poor financial management			2
@entity10 frontbencher @entity132 ’ it ’s a smack in the face to families who are working hard but ca n’t make ends meet , leaving them with no other option but to turn to food banks to feed their families			1
’ these comments are completely misjudged			0
’ @entity173 , director of @entity175 's @entity174 , said : ' thousands are now turning to food banks , but they do not so out of choice , they do so when they have nowhere else to turn			2
' the staggering rise in the numbers of people using food banks is down to failings in the benefit system , too many low paid jobs and rising prices that are dragging huge numbers into poverty			1
' in may a report by @entity190 and @entity175 suggested up to half of those seeking help were doing so as a direct result of having benefit payments delayed , reduced or withdrawn			0
other factors behind the increase on those using emergency help - the ' hidden hungry ' - include rising food prices , unemployment and energy costs			0
but energy secretary @entity202 told @entity51 that it was ' completely wrong to suggest that there is some sort of statistical link between the benefit reforms we 're making and the provision of food banks ' .			1
