by @entity0 for @entity1 ode to @entity3 is one of @entity6 's classics and is often performed by huge orchestras , but this four - year - old boy has found a unique way to play it			0
the boy named @entity10 taps out the familiar tune on a keyboard - using only his nose - after spending a month learning the notes			1
the youngster is as skilled as he is cute , and will no doubt rouse a chorus of ' ahhhs ' as well as a round of applause			0
ode to @entity3 was written by poet @entity20 in 1785 before being famously put to music by composer @entity6 in 1824 as the final movement of his ninth symphony			0
@entity6 used a full orchestra , four solo voices and a choir to perform his version , but all little @entity10 needed was his nose and a keyboard			2
he nose his stuff : @entity31 has found a unique way to play @entity6 's @entity33 - with his nose			1

@entity10 learned how to play the tune after practising for a month
after getting bored of using his *fingers* he took a more *unusual* *approach*
the child *decided* to use his nose to play the @entity6 classic
