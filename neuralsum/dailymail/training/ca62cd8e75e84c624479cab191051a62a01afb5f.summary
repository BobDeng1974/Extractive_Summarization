by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 beat @entity2 to win the 200 metres at the @entity5 ’s @entity4 and immediately targeted @entity7 gold , @entity9 gold and breaking the 20 - second barrier			1
for once , this is not typical sprinters ’ testosterone - fuelled trash talk , but a genuine possibility			0
@entity1 is 23 years old and hungry for success , with a point to prove after being overlooked for a place in last year ’s world championship team			2
concentration : @entity1 ( second from left ) wins the 200m final at the @entity5 's @entity22 championships winning roar : @entity1 wants more and is hungry for @entity7 and @entity9 gold @entity25 : @entity26 knows breaking the 20 - second barrier in the future is not out of his reach @entity1 is ready to add more honours to the @entity9 200m bronze he won two years ago			1
with high - profile @entity33 such as @entity34 and @entity35 choosing to skip the individual events in @entity37 , his timing might finally be right			0
@entity1 ’s winning time of 20.42secs may sound unspectacular , but the swirling wind , cool temperatures and rain at @entity44 ’s @entity43 made this a race rather than a time - trial and @entity1 ’s strong final 50m was the difference			1
@entity2 was second in 20.61secs after stumbling out of his blocks , with @entity52 third in 20.64secs			2
@entity1 said : ‘ i ’ve just beaten a world - class field there			2
it ca n’t really get much harder than running against a 19 - second 200m runner , so if i can beat @entity2 hopefully i can go on and challenge @entity58 and the rest of @entity9			1
' if one @entity22 guy can go sub- 20 , then i think i can be next			2
‘ if i win in @entity63 ( at the @entity64 ) or at the @entity65 in @entity37 , all the hard work i ’ve put in will actually mean something			0
’ ambitious : the eager @entity1 says ' if one @entity22 guy can go sub- 20 , then i think i can be next ' @entity2 , who ran 19.98secs last season and came fifth in the @entity69 final , now has two weeks to run inside the ‘ a ’ qualifying time of 20.55secs required to reach the @entity64			1
@entity71 qualified fastest for saturday ’s 100m semi-finals by coasting to a 10.26 - sec victory in his heat			0
@entity77 , bidding for a fifth consecutive @entity22 title at the age of 36 , won in 10.34secs , while world indoor 60m champion @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 all qualified			0
@entity82 has predicted it will take a sub- 10 - second performance to win the 100m on saturday			0
a bold claim , but with the strength in depth of @entity22 sprinting , it pays to set your sights high			0
ready : @entity1 already won @entity9 200m bronze two years ago but wants to go further			1

@entity1 beat @entity2 to win 200m at @entity22 championships
@entity1 targets @entity7 gold , @entity9 gold and breaking 20 - second barrier
