by @entity0 with an army of celebrity fans , from @entity4 to @entity5 , plus an array of supermodels keen to hang one from their slender arm , @entity1 has long been the handbag of choice for the a-listers			1
and while the prices were always rather sky high , recently the high end fashion brand pushed up the cost of owning a @entity1 tote towards nearly £ 5,000 in a bid to tap into an even more exclusive luxury market			1
but the ploy for the big bucks simply has n't worked and @entity1 have now revealed plans for an about turn and will launch a more affordable range in a bid to win back loyal customers			1
the news comes following a warning that its underlying annual profit would fall below expectations for the fourth time in two years			1
change of tack : @entity32 , whose collaborators include model @entity34 , has pledged to make its products more affordable			2
the luxury goods firm said that profit before tax for the year ended 31 march 2014 was now expected to be around £ 14million , while analysts had been expecting around £ 19million			2
the group , which is still looking for a new chief executive after last month 's departure of @entity45 , said it will look to refocus its sales efforts on offering products at more affordable prices			2
the new strategy was unveiled by former head @entity50 , who oversaw the rapid growth of the @entity1 brand between 2002 and 2012			1
he has returned to the helm on a temporary basis until a permanent boss is found			0
the @entity60 luxury label enlisted @entity61 to be their model of the moment			0
she designed and helped model a mini collection of bags including this signature camouflage backpack under former boss , mr @entity45 's leadership , @entity1 pushed up prices in an attempt to become even more exclusive , with products such as the @entity75 and @entity76 handbags selling for up to £ 4,500			1
however , the increase in prices alienated the company 's core customer base , triggering a slew of profit warnings			0
creative director @entity82 also resigned from the group last year amid speculation over disagreements with mr @entity45			0
mulberry model and designer @entity61 showcased two of her mini collection at @entity90 's @entity89 's following her appointment in 2008 , ms @entity82 was credited with transforming the company into an international fashion powerhouse with a number of celebrity fans , including @entity5 and @entity4			0
the @entity96 : @entity32 recently tried to push its bags into the super exclusive luxury market put the move has only seen profits plummet further popular brand : @entity1 's celebrity fans include @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right )			1
@entity104 's still a fab : the 32 - year - old teamed a recent look with an @entity1 bag @entity1 shares fell 4 per cent after today 's latest profits warning and have more than halved in value since the start of 2013			1
in january , the group issued a profit warning after heavy discounting over @entity116 in @entity60 and weak demand in @entity118 dampened sales			0
in implementing a new strategy , mr @entity120 warned that there will be a short - term ' material ' negative impact on profits but it was necessary to ensure the future strength of the @entity1 brand			1
@entity60 success : @entity82 with her @entity130 disappointing sales : @entity1 has seen a drop in profit over the last 12 months			1
@entity120 said the firm will slow the rate of store openings from eight for 2013/14 to five for the 2014/15 financial year , in order to control costs and enable existing stores to gain traction			2
he added that @entity1 's new factory in @entity143 , which opened in june , was now fully operational with more than 300 workers			1
the @entity146 - based facilities were created thanks to £ 2.5million worth of investment from the government 's @entity149 with the hope of doubling @entity1 's @entity60 capacity			1
mr @entity120 said : ' following the recent change in management , we are focusing on achieving sales growth through the reinforcement of our product offering at more affordable prices to meet the expectations of our loyal customers			0
' this will have short term financial consequences but is necessary to ensure the future strength of the @entity1 brand , ' he added			1
owning a @entity1 handbag used to be the dream for professional young women			1
smart and stylish and just out of reach for most style - conscious twenty - somethings , they would quietly covet the beautiful leather day bags while saving for a wallet or purse from the brand			0
then , in 2009 , the game - changing @entity76 arrived and suddenly @entity1 became the must - have label to be hanging from arms			1
not for profit : @entity180 holding the bag @entity1 named after her , which is no longer a fashion must - have this was the height of the ' it ' bag era and the classic @entity60 company used ' it ' girl @entity180 to revamp and rebrand sending their sales figures soaring			2
with prices starting at £ 525 the bags were expensive but not completely unaffordable , and a generation of young women skipped a rent payment or two to get their hands on one of the range			0
bosses at the @entity143 firm were of course , delighted , and celebrity - endorsed product became a strategy to keep the cool , young , things coming back for more			2
celebrity favourites : @entity1 handbags , including the @entity76 ( left ) , named after @entity60 fashionista @entity180 , and the @entity206 ( right ) , inspired by @entity207 singer @entity206 , regularly adorned the arms of stars the introduction of the @entity211 , inspired by singer @entity206 at @entity212 in february 2012 raised a few eyebrows as the then 19 - year - old was relatively new on the scene , but the fashion press lapped it up and sales continued to rise , as did the confidence of the brand			1
so confident were they in fact , that they decided to start inflating prices to keep up with the high - end designer labels like @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228			0
the brand was now charging upwards of £ 1,000 for fast fashion items designed to appeal to a young market so it was no surprise when profit warnings began circulating			0
stars including @entity236 's @entity235 ( second left ) and @entity237 ( centre ) , and socialite @entity239 on the front row at the @entity1 show at @entity212 the penultimate nail in the coffin for @entity1 's current sky - high pricing strategy was the departure of creative guru @entity82			1
the city took a dim dim view of @entity82 's departure			0
the response of @entity250 , managing director of luxury at investment company @entity252 , was typical : ' @entity1 is trying to reposition itself to the high end			2
mulberry in my view should be cheaper than @entity258 and @entity226			0
' there is little choice for handbags between £ 250 and £ 600			0
market results indicate that @entity1 's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles			2
' in other words , @entity1 's price inflation was greed rather than good sense			2
no one ever thought of it thinks of it in the @entity275 or @entity276 league , its appeal was something else			0
the final nail came in the shape of model - of - the - moment @entity34 who designed the label 's latest collection after already being a face of the brand			0
@entity34 is one of the world 's leading models , but her fan base is young and cool ... and definitely does n't have £ 1,500 to spend on a handbag			0
the problem is that the women who do have £ 1,500 to spend on a handbag do n't want to wear a rucksack endorsed by a 21 - year - old famous for her eyebrows and expanding tattoo collection .			0
