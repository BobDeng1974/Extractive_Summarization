president @entity0 tonight made it clear that he wanted the @entity2 to remain ' strong , robust and united ' , in a dramatic intervention just 24 hours before the referendum			1
in a statement posted on @entity8 , the leader of the @entity6 called the @entity2 ' an extraordinary partner for @entity6 ' and ' a force of good in an unstable world '			1
the message , posted by the @entity14 official @entity8 account , was signed ' bo ' - @entity0 's initials - which means that the message was worded by the president himself			2
the former @entity6 president said he was reluctant to express his view before now because he appreciated the decision was ' @entity25 alone to make '			1
but he said uncertainty over currency and the impact of ' long , complex ' negotiations had convinced him to urge the people of @entity25 to keep the @entity43			0
his views were published in a statement released today by the @entity46			0
president @entity0 's statement reiterates one he made earlier this week , when he urged @entity25 voters not to break apart ‘ one of the closest allies we ’ll ever have ’ by voting for independence on thursday			1
the dramatic intervention , just three days before @entity25 goes to the polls , would have infuriated @entity55 - with the battle for independence set to be decided by the smallest of margins			2
up to half a million voters remain undecided - with concerns over the future of @entity25 ’s place in major international organisations like the @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 still hotly debated			1
mr @entity0 ’s spokesman @entity27 said on monday : ‘ from the outside , the @entity6 has a deep interest in ensuring that one of the closest allies we 'll ever have remains strong , robust , united and an effective partner of the @entity6			1
’ the remarks came after @entity65 secretary general @entity73 confirmed @entity25 would have to reapply to join the military alliance - and stressed that to do every members would have to agree			2
' extraordinary partner ' : president @entity0 said that the @entity2 is a ' force of good in an unstable world '			1
above , prime minister @entity79 today he said : ‘ in case that @entity25 voted in favour of independence then @entity25 would have to apply for membership of @entity65 as a new independent state			1
a decision on accession would have to be taken by unanimity , by consensus as always in @entity65			0
’ the double salvo against independence comes amid warning that the @entity6 would vigorously oppose the @entity55 ’s plan to move @entity2 ’s @entity93 nuclear submarines from the @entity94 after independence			1
@entity2 ’s nuclear capability is key strand of @entity65 ’s military defence and any threat would spark fury in @entity101			2
earlier this year mr @entity0 used the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings to praise the @entity2 and warn against @entity25 separatism			1
speaking alongside @entity79 , mr @entity0 said : ' i would say that the @entity2 has been an extraordinary partner to us			2
‘ from the outside at least , it looks like things have worked pretty well			0
' the @entity2 people will make the ‘ right decision ’ in an in - out referendum , he said			2
‘ we obviously have a deep interest in making sure one of the closest allies we will ever remains a strong , robust , united and effective partner			1
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ whenever our two nations stand together , it can leave a world that is more secure and more prosperous and more just			0
‘ on that day , like so many others , @entity6 and @entity2 troops stood together and fought valiantly alongside our allies			1
‘ they did n't just help to win the war , they helped to turn the tide of human history and are the reason that we can stand here today in a free @entity128 and with the freedoms that our nations enjoy			0
‘ theirs is the legacy that our two nations and our great alliance continue to uphold and i 'm grateful to have a fine partner in @entity79 in making that happen			0
’ earlier this week , @entity79 urged @entity25 not to vote for independence in a speech to @entity46 supporters in @entity141 today president @entity0 's intervention will have delighted the prime minister , who is battling to save the union @entity25 's first minister @entity55 - at @entity146 in @entity147 today - has previously made light of @entity6 criticism of @entity25 independence mr @entity55 attempted to make light of the remarks at the time			1
speaking to @entity153 , mr @entity55 said : ‘ @entity6 had to fight for its independence			0
we are very fortunate in @entity25 that we have a democratic , agreed , consented process by which we can vote for our independence			0
‘ so , in summary , i suppose my message to president @entity0 is “ yes we can ”			0
’ mr @entity0 is not the first world leader to have spoken out against independence			0
@entity164 prime minister @entity163 last month said : ' as a friend of @entity2 , as an observer from afar , it ’s hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent @entity153			0
' genealogists believe they can trace mr @entity0 ’s ancestry to @entity171 , who ruled @entity25 from 1165 to 1214			2
a maternal ancestor of mr @entity0 , @entity173 , is said to have emigrated from @entity25 to @entity6 in the 17th century			1
the first minister has never met mr @entity0 but did invite him attend the @entity175 , although he did not get a reply			0
