they have no training ground , one of the smallest budgets in the entire @entity3 and , some might say , little chance of reaching the fifth round of the @entity7			1
but after a weekend of upsets , @entity8 will fancy their chances of adding @entity11 to the list of @entity14 casualties on monday evening			1
@entity16 's capitulation to @entity17 after a few days in @entity18 does not augur well for the @entity19 , who have been sunning themselves in @entity21 ahead of the visit to @entity23			1
@entity8 's inspirational manager @entity24 ( right ) has been nursing a virus for most of the week volunteers spent last week clearing snow off the covers while inspirational manager @entity24 was laid up in bed			1
' a little bit of cup fever , ' suggests @entity24			1
he and @entity8 were made for one another			1
a former defender for the @entity36 club , the 45 - year - old is in his second spell as manager having led them out of the fourth tier of @entity41 football in each of his two tenures			1
@entity8 currently occupy a play - off place in @entity44 , and this is the second year in a row they have reached the fourth round of the @entity7			1
@entity24 's £ 1.5million budget would hardly cover the wages of @entity11 's players for a week , but he dismisses suggestions that @entity52 's side might not be up for the fight on monday night			1
@entity11 boss @entity52 believes his side will be refreshed after their winter break to @entity21 ' i do n't think there will be any surprises for @entity11 , ' he says			1
' they 've got quite a few @entity62 - based players			2
' with the likes of @entity64			0
@entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 in there , there 's a nucleus of players who understand what it takes in a game like this			0
' knowing @entity52 , i do n't think he will let his team get complacent playing against a team like @entity8			1
' @entity24 is a big @entity78 fan who saw @entity52 win three @entity7 winner 's medals during his time at @entity82			1
his favourite memory is @entity86 's decisive @entity85 strike against @entity87 in 1996			0
@entity8 's @entity88 in action for @entity8 against @entity90 ' another one is 1977 when @entity78 beat @entity87			1
that was one of my first stand - out moments where i said , ' wow , the @entity7 is special '			2
' i grew up admiring @entity96 and @entity97			0
they 're really big players in my memory			0
i 'm not a glory @entity78 supporter , i support the history of the club and what 's made it special , even in those days when they were n't so successful			0
' @entity52 was an exceptional player for @entity78 and is equally a very good manager			2
the way he played resembles his teams			0
' @entity8 's chairman @entity110 made his money from heating churches and the club are proud to operate within their means — even if they have to do without a permanent training base			2
@entity11 will be hoping to avoid a fourth round @entity7 upset when they take on @entity44 outfit @entity8 @entity24 says : ' we beg , steal or borrow facilities — the majority of the time we borrow			1
there 's always a plan in place regardless of not having a permanent fixed training venue			0
' but we do n't go borrowing from the bank			0
we regenerate our own money which is special , but to continue to be successful is hard			0
if i thought about it too much i 'm sure it would scare me			0
' we should really be fighting against relegation because we 've got the smallest budget in the league and we 're fighting against some really big sides for the opportunity to remain in a play - off place			0
' one thing i would say about the players is that they have embraced the @entity7			2
we 've played nine games in this competition in the last two seasons and only been beaten once			0
' it can help the coffers , it certainly does			0
we do n't budget to get so far in the @entity7			2
the prize money itself has generated income , but for the players it 's about playing @entity11			2

@entity8 face @entity11 in the fourth round of the @entity7
the @entity19 have spent most of the week on a *mid-season* break in @entity21
@entity8 manager @entity24 has been suffering with a virus
