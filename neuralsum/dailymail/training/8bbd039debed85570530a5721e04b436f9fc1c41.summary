by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 11:23 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 could get its first cannabis cafe if a @entity6 councillor 's attempt to open a shop in @entity8 gets the go ahead			1
@entity10 , a councillor for @entity11 , has already started looking for possible sites for an @entity14 - style cafe in @entity15 or @entity16 in anticipation of a law change			1
mr @entity10 , who has admitted to being an ex-recreational drug - user , has submitted his proposals in response to what he considers a shift in popular opinion towards legalising the class - b drug			2
in february , deputy prime minister @entity26 said that the @entity2 should explore alternatives to a blanket ban on drugs and @entity2 should be at the heart of the debate			0
similar plans for a members - only cannabis cafe in @entity46 , where users would have only been able to buy the drug once legalised , were rejected in january			1
but mr @entity10 believes his plans , with the backing of the community , stand a better chance of being approved and he is holding a public meeting in @entity11 tomorrow to gather local opinion			1
however , mr @entity10 has faced opposition from @entity56 , who refused to even discuss the issue			2
@entity59 , @entity8 's police and crime commissioner for the area , declined an invitation to attend the meeting where a number of speakers will debate the proposals			2
speakers due to attend the meeting include professor @entity69 from the @entity70 , who is an expert on the subject of drugs and crime and has written several books on the topic			0
last year , mr @entity69 backed a controversial trial by @entity77 which involved ' the nasal administration of cocaine ' by hundreds of students			0
other attendees will include the @entity82 , a group which meets to discuss the plant and the laws surrounding it , and charity @entity86			0
a @entity8 councillor for @entity11 , @entity10 , ( left ) is leading plans to launch @entity2 's first cannabis cafe			1
a public meeting discussing the plans will be held tomorrow in @entity92 , @entity8			1
@entity69 ( right ) , a professor at the @entity70 and an expert on drugs and crime will be attending the meeting mr @entity10 told @entity97 that he had been ' inundated with messages from local cannabis users who said they will be coming to the meeting '			1
he said : ' the debate about drugs and policing is becoming much more topical			0
' but @entity8 police commissioner ms @entity59 told the newspaper that a cannabis cafe would be illegal unless drug laws were changed			1
she said : ' we live in a democracy and if people want the law changed on the use of cannabis , then they really need to lobby their local mp			0
' @entity8 police commissioner @entity59 said that a cannabis cafe in in the area would be illegal unless drug laws were changed this is not the first time the concept of a cannabis cafe has been floated in the @entity2			1
in january , police in @entity46 blocked the introduction of a cannabis ' social club ' in the city 's @entity128			2
the man behind the club was @entity132 who once famously handed the @entity133 a bouquet of flowers containing cannabis			0
his planned club would have been open to members only at a fee of Â£ 35 per year			0
drugs would not have been sold at the cafe unless there had been a change in the law			0
but @entity145 said that the cafe would attract criminality and would be difficult to police and the concept was quashed			2
the @entity149 tried to stamp out illegal drug dealing in the 1970s by introducing cannabis cafes - called ' coffee shops '			1
recreational drugs , including marijuana , are still illegal in @entity14 but cannabis and some hallucinogenic mushrooms - known as ' magic ' mushrooms , have been decriminalised and may be used in these ' coffee shops ' under certain restrictions			1
to enter the shop you must be over 18 and the coffee shops are not permitted to sell alcohol			2
they must also be licensed and display a green and white license in the window			0
some drug experts say that the cafes keep users away from harder drugs			0
do not confuse a cannabis coffee shop and an actual coffee shop : a licensed seller of cannabis products is referred to as a coffeeshop , a koffiehuis ( coffee house ) sells coffee and light meals .			0

councillor @entity10 for @entity11 , @entity8 , is looking for venues in the county
in @entity185 the cannabis cafes are called ' coffee shops '
if *successful* , the cafe would be the first in the country
a public meeting will be held tomorrow in @entity92 to discuss plans
plans for a @entity46 cannabis cafe were quashed earlier this year
