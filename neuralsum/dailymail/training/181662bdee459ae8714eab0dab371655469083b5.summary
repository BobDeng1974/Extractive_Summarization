doctors were unsure if they were going to make it past their first few days , but now the @entity3 septuplets are celebrating turning 16 - and planning driving lessons , college degrees and careers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , the world 's first septuplets to survive infancy , are marking the milestone on tuesday , november 19 at their home in @entity19 , @entity20			1
' it 's sad how quickly it 's gone , ' their mother @entity21 told a local newspaper of the past 16 years			1
@entity21 and her husband @entity7 famously declined selective reduction after learning they were pregnant with seven children following fertility treatment , saying it was ' in @entity33 's hands '			1
celebration : the @entity3 ( with their parents , @entity7 and @entity21 , center , and their big sister @entity37 , back left ) are turning 16 on tuesday			1
they are the world 's first surviving septuplets together : @entity40 , @entity12 , @entity10 , , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity7 ( light blue shirt ) , @entity13 and @entity11 ( laying across laps )			1
the septuplets generated world wide attention after they were born november 19 , 1997 ' i will always remember the day we found out there were so many , ' @entity21 told the @entity48			1
' it was n't like " yoohoo ! " there were so many doubts			0
to a lot of people this might sound trite , but @entity33 determined the outcome			0
' learning they had septuplets on the way sparked international headlines that would chart the children 's every move			1
after the babies were born nine weeks prematurely in @entity48 in 1997 , joining their big sister , @entity64 , news crews swarmed their modest one - floor home			2
amid the media frenzy , president @entity68 personally called the family to congratulate the family , @entity67 welcomed them on her show and companies and strangers scrambled to help out the couple			0
early days : @entity3 , pictured in 1998 , used fertility treatment and had refused selective reduction babies ' day out : she prepares to take out her nine - month - old babies with the help of friends in 1998 helping hand : @entity64 , who was nearly 2 when her siblings were born , is pictured helping her mother staying healthy : @entity21 takes one of her sons to the doctors			1
doctors were stunned they were all healthy doting : big sister @entity64 helps out her parents by caring for one of her little sisters in 1998 at the time of the conception of both @entity64 and the septuplets , @entity3 was undergoing treatments of an ovulation - stimulating drug called @entity98 , which primes a woman 's eggs for successful conception			1
but while it often takes repeated doses to get pregnant , with the septuplets , @entity21 conceived the children on the first treatment			1
a @entity108 article about the family noted that while doctors can carefully control the number of embryos they insert with in - vitro fertilization , fertility drugs are basically a roll of the dice			1
she had been warned that in around 20 per cent of cases , women had seen multiple births - but they were shocked to learn she was carrying seven babies			0
while septuplets had previously been delivered , none had lived beyond a few weeks			0
so the @entity124 ' doctors suggested they undergo ' selective reduction ' - in which several of the fetuses are aborted so the others have a better chance at being healthy			1
but the couple are religious @entity131 and opposed to abortion so did not even consider the procedure			0
among the donations , they received a 5,500 square foot home , a van , a year 's worth of @entity140 's macaroni and cheese , diapers for the first two years and full college scholarships for any state university in @entity20			2
during the early months , the septuplets drank 42 bottles a day and went through 52 diapers			0
but over the years , the media coverage has waned and the coupons for free food have run out - encouraging the family to be frugal			0
and from their early teenage years , the septuplets have been helping out the family by carrying out chores , such as their own laundry			0
the family still lives in the same house that was donated after the births and continues to use the same van			0
and while the four boys and three girls are looking forward to being 16 and driving , their father , who still works at a metal coating plant , warned that they can only have cars once they get jobs			0
he is also up against other teenage challenges			0
' the biggest challenge is making sure they keep up with certain things but not keep up with certain things , trendy things , ' @entity7 said of his teenagers			2
' three of them have cellphones and a couple have @entity177			0
' the family has saved to cover braces for several of the children and the medical needs of @entity11 and @entity12 , who were born with forms of cerebral palsy			1

while @entity21 said she missed the media , the children are less bothered			2
