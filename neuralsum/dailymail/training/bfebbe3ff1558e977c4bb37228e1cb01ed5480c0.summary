a new study looking into the cannabis use of almost 4000 teenagers across @entity3 and @entity4 has revealed the drug has a high chance of causing adverse problems in users ' adult life			1
the report , which was published in @entity12 journal , assessed the data from three long running studies by looking at five different levels of cannabis user patterns in children aged under 17 - never , less than monthly , monthly or more , weekly or more , and daily			1
dr @entity18 , the lead author of the study , described the findings as ' startling ' and said that although daily users recorded the most adverse conclusions , ' there was a sliding scale of effects '			2
the study analysed data from three long running studies of almost 4000 teenagers aged under 17 across @entity3 and @entity4 ' there was a clear dose response effect which means the more frequently they used it , the more likely they were to experience a range of harm in adult hood , ' dr @entity18 told @entity37			1
' for daily users , by the age of 25 , they were over 60 percent less likely to have completed high school or to have obtained a degree and seven times more likely to attempt suicide			1
' ' they are 18 times more likely to be cannabis dependant and eight times as likely to use other illicit drugs			1
' ' the risks of those outcomes were still there for people who smoked less frequently , but they were reduced			2
' researchers also found that the risks still remained even after they took a wide range of confounding factors into account			0
@entity37 smokers were 60 percent less likely to have completed high school or to have obtained a degree and seven times more likely to attempt suicide by the age of 25 ' we were able to include in the analysis , 53 other factors which might explain the association which we observed			2
they were things like socio - economic status , gender , parental mental health and drug use and peer drug use , ' dr @entity18 said			0
' we found that even after taking those factors into account , the associations still held up			0
' dr @entity18 said the findings have implications for both prevention and government policy on cannabis			0
@entity37 smokers were also 18 times more likely to be cannabis dependant and eight times as likely to use other illicit drugs by their mid 20s he said finding a way to prevent or delay the sue of cannabis in young adults would have enormous health and social benefits and that policy makers need to evaluate and be aware of the harms associated with the drug as law reforms take place			1
' the findings are relevant given the movement in some countries to decriminalise or legalise cannabis raising a possibility that cannabis might become more accessible to young people , ' the report states			0
the report was completed in association with the @entity106 which was ' formed in order to be able to address important questions around cannabis use and make more efficient use of existing data that had already been collected , ' mr @entity18 said .			0
