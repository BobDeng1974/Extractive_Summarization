preconceptions , i find , can be really unhelpful , so before travelling to @entity2 , a luxury hotel in @entity4 , i decided not to find out anything about it			1
i preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival			1
i was travelling with my old mucker @entity9 ( from @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 )			1
our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit , but since then we have , by chance , both acquired part - time homes in the same seaside town			1
it is @entity9 who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing channel			1
@entity25 personified : the @entity26 has all the colour and wonder of the @entity29 , says @entity30 setting off for the @entity32 , there was something of the @entity34 about us , blithering away in actressy tones , trying to charm the @entity38 crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade			1
) but that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving @entity43 behind in cold mid-december was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of @entity45			1
after a 30 - minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests , the @entity2 appeared with all the colour and wonder of the @entity29			1
full - size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance , as beautiful silk sari - clad @entity4 staff welcomed us with cocktails			1
in the background , the ubiquitous lobby pianist / singer warbled away to @entity60			1
a minor note of tedium			2
@entity45 is an archipelago of 104 islands in the @entity65 , 20 miles off the coast of @entity4			1
in 2007 it was given @entity69 status by @entity70			2
the @entity26 and @entity71 is in the north west of the island			2
@entity30 ( left ) with painter @entity9 at the @entity75 hotel in @entity4 this paradise in the middle of a ten million - year - old rainforest was created in 1990			1
designed by @entity80 architect @entity79 around @entity81 - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world , with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete			2
to minimise its impact on the jungle , @entity79 limited the size of the main building and added 40 villas over the extensive grounds , along with restaurants and a spa alongside a creek			2
he sourced wood , marble and stone from across the island and mainland @entity4 to create @entity103 walls , @entity105 roofs and @entity107 screens			2
the result sees soft , subtle colours creating an atmosphere throughout of calm tranquillity , offset by genuine animal sounds that could well come from a @entity113			2
leaving the main building behind , we were taken by golf buggy down the ' yellow brick roads ' through the enchanted forest , across bridges , and past waterfalls and freshwater streams to our elegant beach villa where we were met by our butlers			2
keen to revive our weary bones , @entity9 asked if it was safe to swim			1
' no , ' came the answer			2
' why not ? ' she questioned , expecting to be told of danger			2
' because it is dark , ' the butler replied with a smile			2
spot of swimming anyone ? the @entity133 turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time clearly he does n't know @entity9			1
she has been part of a team swimming the @entity139 in extreme conditions and also took part in the @entity142 in @entity143 ( ' you can feel your body slowing down as hypothermia begins to set in ' , she boasts )			2
she is made of stern stuff			2
despite it being close to midnight , we ran down to the beach , disrobing and squealing , before plunging into the silky - smooth @entity65 sea			1
@entity152 streamed through the water , illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of @entity156 on the horizon			1
it was a magical beginning to our holiday			0
back at our opulent @entity160 - meets - @entity162 villa , we were quite overcome by the super-sized beds , hot outdoor showers , plunge pool , @entity167 sound system , zillionthread soft cotton sheets , quietly whirring wooden fans , high - tech lighting ( we longed for a light switch ) and blackout blinds			0
buggies can be summoned at a moment 's notice , but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach , through the jungle , along wooden walkways and up the 139 @entity181 - inspired steps to breakfast			1
clutching our nature books , we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe - eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from @entity187 vines through the trees			1
first class display : the pair were serenaded by doe - eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees @entity193 kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead , and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth			1
it really was a first - class display from the jungle inhabitants			0
after breakfast on the terrace , we took mountain bikes and cycled to the resort 's golf course			0
golf is not really my thing , but if you know your sand wedge from your nine iron , this course is fantastic - everything is groomed to within an inch of a stepford wife			0
in fact , the @entity217 has been voted the best ' new ' golf course in the world			0
having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed , @entity9 arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation : a monkey burglary			1
every drawer had been wrenched open , newspapers shredded , jars unscrewed , suitcase contents scattered and chocolates eaten - tiny slivers of silver paper being the only remains of a @entity236			0
@entity9 had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had ' relieved ' themselves on			1
we did n't need a forensics team to identify our uninvited guests as chocolatey paw prints were everywhere			0
i was secretly rather thrilled with their ingenuity			0
after such excitement , a sea dip was needed before several @entity249 cocktails and much embellished recounting of ' @entity251 '			0
the four restaurants at the @entity2 are overseen by executive chef @entity253			0
there 's the @entity249 specialising in @entity256 and international cuisine ; the @entity257 , tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome @entity105 and @entity260 offerings ; the @entity261 in the main building ; and @entity263 , a restaurant on 100ft - high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants ( yes , really )			0
@entity9 remarked that it resembled a ' birds ' nest in the sky ' , albeit one that serves traditional @entity156 cuisine			1
such was our commitment to sampling all the restaurants , we both managed to gain half a stone in a week			0
@entity30 heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast the most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats , save for the @entity283 ( @entity284 ) , a traditional wooden @entity4 junk schooner hand - built in the boatyards of @entity287 on the east coast of @entity4			1
we were invited aboard for a trip to the @entity290 to watch brown eagles feed and , in @entity9 's case , to find dolphins			1
her chosen method to summon these creatures was to serenade them in full operatic mode with songs from @entity299 - an impressive but futile exercise as they stayed away			0
if the many activities at the @entity2 become too much , gentler pursuits are on offer , such as an 8am nature walk that teaches participants the ways of the forest			0
for me , however , it was a bit early for concentration , so i excused myself and enjoyed a lazy breakfast			0
later , in the bathroom , a bean bagsized frog fell from the air - con vent on to my head before hopping on to the cistern , blinking into the daylight : a reminder , were one needed , of the herculean task it must be preventing the jungle from taking back its land			0
during our stay , in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake , we swam morning , noon and night			1
one longer excursion across the tranquil @entity81 with flippers and snorkels resulted in us being spiked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish			0
neither incident was a huge deal , but the @entity2 nurses were on hand within moments of us returning to land , and even took time to check on us the following day			0
before leaving @entity75 , we squeezed in a trip to the spa , which is open to the jungle			0
i could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping			1
the ubiquitous plinky - plonky spa musak was quickly redundant when the heavens open and the full rainforest orchestra began its symphony in earnest			0
during my 90 - minute treatment - a @entity353 massage - i 'm not sure i have ever been , nor will ever be again , in such a state of zen relaxation			0
the @entity2 was truly special			0
mystical , spiritual , romantic , luxurious , life - affirming ... and fattening			0
we ca n't wait to go back			0
experience @entity358 ( @entity360 , 020 3468 6268 ) offers seven nights ' b&b at @entity2 from Â£ 1,999 per person , including return flights from @entity365 and transfers .			0
