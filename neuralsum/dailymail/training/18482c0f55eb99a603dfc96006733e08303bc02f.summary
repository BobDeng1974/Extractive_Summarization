@entity1 's capacity to score goals that somehow manage to be both wondrous and worthless seemingly knows no bounds			1
from @entity5 ’s majestic solo strike against @entity6 in @entity7 in 1978 to @entity9 ’s inch - perfect finish against the @entity10 in @entity11 eight years later , @entity1 seem to have cornered the market in tear - stained souvenirs for generations			1
when @entity18 raced clear to beat @entity19 and make it 1 - 1 in @entity16 last month , it briefly looked like the age - old script had been fed to the shredder			1
sadly , it proved to be wishful thinking			2
@entity18 scores past @entity24 for @entity1 during their @entity26 qualifying match in @entity16 @entity18 can barely believe he scored against @entity24 for @entity1 during their @entity26 qualifying match still , in the aftermath of that 2 - 1 defeat to the newly - crowned world champions , the @entity31 man rightly basked in his moment of glory			1
he took to @entity37 to proclaim his amazement at putting one past the world ’s finest goalie , something he admitted he could n’t even do on his @entity44 computer game			1
endearing though @entity47 ’s reaction was , nothing could dress up a familiar failing for the national team - that far too many of our finest moments down the years have ultimately counted for nothing			1
sitting inside @entity55 on monday , the kid from @entity54 reflected on the high watermark of his football career with a rueful smile			2
when the subject turned to the need for it not to be merely a flash in the pan , he was typically on the front foot			2
‘ when you have that feeling you want to work twice as hard to relive it , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t want to be just the person who scored against @entity24			1
ultimately we lost the game so it was n’t even a winner			1
‘ i ’d like to be remembered as one of the team who qualified for 2016			2
the work ethic stays the same and nothing changes			2
@entity18 sent this tweet out after scoring against @entity24 for @entity1 during @entity26 qualifying @entity18 took to @entity37 to announce his surprise at scoring for @entity1 against world champions @entity24 ‘ i do n’t think the goal will change me drastically			1
when you play with higher quality players you will improve			2
i do n’t think the confidence given to me by the gaffer will change			2
the view that we can achieve anything remains the way this squad feels			2
’ it ’s not hard to see why @entity9 has hung his hat on the 26 - year - old			2
notwithstanding the fact this boy can shift at a fierce rate of knots , he can play and he can finish			2
he also possesses an engaging , effervescent personality , and is a beacon of positivity and belief			0
the type you ca n’t have too many of			0
such has been his impact for his country over the past year that , despite @entity31 sitting fourth in the @entity105 , @entity9 feels bigger clubs – @entity108 for one – would be a better fit			1
‘ in football , rumours are spread around all the time , ’ @entity47 straight - batted			1
‘ until things are concrete , i do n’t think you can speculate			0
‘ i phoned him ( @entity9 after his comments ) because i just wanted to thank him personally for what he ’s said			0
the game against @entity24 was a year to the day basically to when i made my debut against @entity120			1
‘ i thanked him after my first cap and then when i saw the selfless comments i wanted to thank him again			0
he could play @entity124 players ahead of me but he has faith and for that i ’m grateful			0
‘ having the confidence of a manager of that pedigree is only going to give you confidence			0
there is no fear when you walk onto the pitch and that is the best thing a player can have			0
that particularly applies to a player in my position , where you have to make things happen			0
’ @entity18 : ‘ i do n’t think the goal will change me drastically			1
when you play with quality players you improve ' championship side @entity31 's winger @entity18 is grateful to have his chance to perform for @entity1 not a day passes when @entity143 ’ t reflect on his eventful journey to this point – via @entity54 , @entity146 , @entity147 , a string of b teams in @entity150 then redemption via @entity153 ’s academy that preceded a move to @entity31			1
‘ i used to have to get three buses when i started my apprenticeship at @entity146 and i decided to live at home , ’ he recalled			0
‘ i had to get up at 5.30am and get one bus to @entity160 city centre , one to @entity146 and then another to the training ground			0
i ’d always get there early and that ’s why now i ’m still at the training ground early			0
’ all those hard miles have been worth it in the long run			0
as the son of a @entity170 research assistant and a @entity172 economist , @entity47 ’s formative years were spent dreaming of one day running out at @entity55			1
come the visit of @entity174 next month , he ’ll finally have his way			1
‘ i did n’t go to games as a kid			0
i did n’t start playing football until i went to @entity179 because my dad wanted me to concentrate on my studies first			0
i used to watch the games on tv , though			0
‘ i hope my first game at the ground will now be for @entity1			1
this is the first time i ’ve been in the stadium			0
‘ it is a bit crazy			0
as a kid , this is the team you support			0
when i approached the stadium today , i was like : “ wow ! ”			0
this is quite a big deal			0
’ come october 11 , the old place should be pulsating			1
if @entity24 away on the opening night was a shot to nothing , the clash with the @entity199 offers no room for error			1
home games against the flotsam and jetsam of @entity205 have to serve up no less than three points if qualification is to become a reality			0
@entity1 face @entity174 in their next @entity26 qualifying match on october 11 after the narrow @entity24 defeat @entity1 lost 2 - 1 to @entity213 winners @entity24 but will look to take something from the @entity174 clash ‘ even against @entity24 , we went into that with the intention of trying to win it , ’ @entity47 continued			1
‘ first half we were maybe a little tentative but we put on a good performance in the second - and we ’re going to go into these two games ( against @entity174 and @entity223 ) to win them			1
‘ i saw an interview with @entity226 a couple of weeks back when he said this @entity1 squad has more quality than any other he ’s been in			1
‘ i have n’t been in previous squads but i know when i come here there is such intensity and quality in training			0
‘ i ca n’t compare it to anything else and it is all relatively new to me , but i think we have as good as chance as anyone to qualify			0
‘ it is part of the progression going on in @entity243 football that it will be regarded as failure if we do n’t qualify			1
we need to assume that responsibility and qualify			0
if we use the performance against @entity24 as the bar , we ’re going to win a lot of games			2
’ tickets for @entity174 v @entity1 at @entity55 on october 11 are now available on public sale via www.scottishfa.co.uk or 0844 875 1873			1

@entity18 scored past @entity24 goalkeeper @entity19 , then took to @entity37 to post : ' @entity255 '
@entity1 ultimately lost 2 - 1 to @entity24 in the @entity26 qualifying match
the @entity243 face @entity174 next on october 11 and @entity47 is eager to impact
