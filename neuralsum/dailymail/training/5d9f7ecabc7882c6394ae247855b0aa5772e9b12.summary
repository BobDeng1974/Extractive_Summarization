my @entity1 contestant @entity0 has been at the centre of controversy this week , after claims from his ex-wife that he 's a ' deadbeat dad ' who does n't see or support his kids			1
@entity8 told @entity9 on monday that the reality show contestant owed close to $ 40,000 in child support for their five children			1
now it seems the wannabe chef may be forced to dish out the dosh from his estimated $ 1,000 a week @entity17 salary , along with a portion of any winnings , should he and new wife @entity20 take away the $ 250,000 first place prize			0
' indeed , if there are any arrears in child support , that money can be earmarked towards those arrears , ' @entity28 told the publication			2
' the @entity44 also has the power to request that @entity46 [ or the producers ] pay that money directly to them by something called a " garnishee order " , ' she added			2
@entity8 claims she had sent producers a letter in january for that purpose , however @entity46 say they never received her letter			1
' deadbeat dad ' ? my @entity1 contestant @entity0 's ex-wife claimed he owes close to $ 40,000 in child support for their children , saying he 's ' pretty much wiped his hands ' of them another income ? family law expert @entity28 told @entity33 on wednesday that @entity0 's appearance and any winnings on the show could be taxable and therefore could be garnished to pay arrears @entity46 also refused to confirm or deny the estimated $ 1,000 weekly salary given to contestants , which was revealed by a former @entity17 contestant to @entity33			1
' we do n't comment on our contest agreements , ' a spokesperson told @entity75			0
the former reality tv personality is understood to have told the publication , that in the past some contestants have avoided paying tax on their @entity17 earnings by claiming their time on the show was a " hobby " , as opposed to a job			0
it 's also unclear if the quarter of a million dollars prize money is taxable			0
however , @entity28 says regardless of taxable income , @entity8 has the right to make a ' change of assessment ' application to the child support agency if @entity0 's financial circumstances change significantly , such as winning the prize money			1
in the explosive interview , @entity8 also claimed that her ex is friends with one of the show 's judges , @entity102 - coaching him on the court as well as working at @entity102 's @entity106 restaurant @entity104 's , in @entity32 , after the couple 's separation			1
owing child support : @entity8 made the explosive claims on a current affair on monday night @entity0 's former wife of almost 20 years , told @entity9 on monday night that she was speaking out on the show instead of dealing with the matter privately because , ' he has blocked my number and both his childrens ' numbers - the older two girls have phones '			1
@entity0 's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married @entity20 - his partner on the @entity46 reality show - but she claims that 's when her issues with child support payments began			1
a @entity46 spokesperson told @entity75 in response to @entity8 's claims : ' this is a private matter between the parties involved			2
' @entity46 also refuted the assertion , that @entity0 and @entity102 are friends : ' they [ @entity0 and @entity102 ] met for the first time on the program '			2
happier times : the couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together ranging in age : their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age ' he has known @entity102 , he knows him through tennis , through coaching him , ' @entity8 told reporter @entity145			2
' we get no financial support at all , ' she also told @entity149			0
@entity8 claims her concern is that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year , which she says ' worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father			0
' ' the children also have no emotional support from him			0
he does not ring them , nor come and see them , ' she said , adding ' they do not receive a card [ for birthdays ] in the mail , not even a phone call			0
' ' he 's never played an active , massive role in their lives anyway ... but basically his role now is non-existent , he 's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children , ' @entity8 said			2
upset : the blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after @entity0 's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters the blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it 's ' significantly impacting on the children '			1
@entity8 not only took aim at @entity0 during the interview but also at the @entity186 and producers of @entity17			1
' it seems there is little they [ child support agency ] can do , irrespective of him being in the print that he 's working at three private schools doing tennis , irrespective of his face being on @entity17			1
' they consistently say there is no source of collection , there is no avenue for us to collect revenue , ' she said			0
friends in high place ? @entity0 's ex-wife also claims the former tennis pro used to coach judge @entity102 , a claim @entity46 refute spokesman and general manager for the @entity44 , who over-sees the @entity186 , @entity209 told @entity149 : ' i ca n't talk about individual cases but let me assure you , that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations			1
' ' we will do whatever it takes to recover that money , ' he added			0
following the explosive @entity9 interview , tv week published quotes from the former tennis professional discussing his difficult divorce , saying the situation ' is not ideal '			0
' obviously i 'd like to spend more time with them , ' he told the magazine			0
however , @entity46 claim the tv week interview was done prior to @entity0 's ex-wife 's interview earlier this week and the article has since been taken off their website			1
at the time the former tennis pro had said : ' any split from a former wife is going to be tough and yeah it is tough , ' he said , adding : ' things end because both parties are unhappy			0
' ' if everything was great we â€™d still be together , ' he said .			0
