by @entity0 published : 15:02 est , 22 august 2013 @entity2 : 15:08 est , 23 august 2013 it was supposed to be the grand restoration of a historic painting of @entity6			1
but instead it ended up being likened to a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey			0
however , the 82 - year - old artist accused of ruining the 1910 depiction of @entity6 called @entity12 has had the last laugh			1
before and ... after : the @entity15 artwork @entity12 ( behold @entity16 ) before , left , and after , right , it was worked on by @entity17			1
damp had severely damaged the original original : the @entity21 before water damage and @entity12 combined to turn it into ' @entity24 ' the fresco became such a massive tourist attraction at the @entity28 in @entity29 , north eastern @entity30 , officials began charging people one euro to look at the piece of art. just one year on , the church has made Â £ 57,000 from ticket sales which has been used to improve the building and cover other costs			1
artist @entity12 has also came to an agreement with the foundation over image rights			1
panic attacks : @entity12 , 81 , has not been able to leave her home after coming under fire for ' ruining ' image of @entity6 in the city of @entity48 she is entitled to 49 per cent of profits generated from the restored @entity12			1
the amusing image has even been imprinted on t - shirts , mugs and key - chains			0
@entity17 has pledged to donate her share of the money to fund charitable work			0
' no one is going to get rich out of this , ' @entity17 's lawyer told @entity61			0
' the foundation and @entity63 are to give the profits to charity			2
' @entity17 had earlier said she wanted to donate the money to charities for muscular atrophy , a condition affecting her son			0
however the deal has not impressed descendants of the original painter @entity15			0
@entity15 's family withheld their consent because they wanted to see the painting returned to its original state , according to @entity29 's deputy mayor @entity79			2
the whole saga is reminiscent of the @entity82 film in 1997 , when @entity84 's hapless character totally destroys the @entity86 's painting - colloquially known as ' @entity87 ' .			2
