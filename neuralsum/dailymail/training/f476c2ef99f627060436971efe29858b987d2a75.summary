@entity0 will have to be mindful of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine to avoid sunburn a lobster - red sunburn is not a good look on anyone and can result in painful blistering and long - term skin damage			1
now @entity0 will have to be more careful than ever of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine			1
this is because a recently formed ozone hole over the @entity0 is allowing high levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet ( @entity14 ) rays to travel through the atmosphere , increasing the risk of fair skin being burned			1
the ozone layer in the @entity20 ’s stratosphere usually prevents most of the uv rays reaching people far below			1
every year ozone levels over @entity24 and sometimes the @entity25 , plummet because of the use of @entity27 by humans and ozone from other areas fill the gap			2
consequently , uv levels in @entity0 have soared in recent days with the formation of a new ozone hole			1
as skin has been swathed in warm clothes over winter , it has not had time to acclimatise to @entity14 by making a brown pigment called melanin , which protects the dna in skin cells against damage from uv rays by absorbing the incoming radiation			2
people particularly susceptible to sunburn also have to be careful at this time of year , as although temperature may not be as high as summer , the light is still powerful as the sun is higher in the sky			1
@entity52 of @entity53 told @entity54 : ‘ there ’s more sunburn at @entity57 than the middle of june ’			1
‘ it ’s not necessarily hot , but the levels of ultraviolet in sunshine are rising and if there ’s an ozone hole it exacerbates the problem			1
’ the ozone hole is an annual thinning of the ozone layer over @entity24 , caused by stratospheric chlorine			1
smaller areas of thinning are known as ozone holes			0
every year ozone layers over @entity24 fall drastically during the @entity75 's spring and the @entity25 can be affected too			2
experts think this started happening in the 1970s as a result of the use of @entity27 , which were popularly found in aerosols , @entity81 explained			0
the hole forms in the @entity24 because cold air is trapped by strong circulating winds and leads to the formation of ice clouds , which break down chlorine - containing compounds , because of our use of @entity27			0
this makes the area especially susceptible to ozone depletion			0
to plug the gap , ozone from other areas returns over the affected poles every year			0
but small holes still occur elsewhere			0
@entity100 worshipers beware ! a recent ozone hole over the @entity0 is allowing high levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet rays to travel through the atmosphere and burn fair skin			1
the ozone layer in the @entity20 's stratosphere ( illustrated ) usually prevents most of the uv rays reaching people far below experts advise wearing a summer hat – even though it is @entity113 – especially between 11am and 3pm when the sunshine is at its strongest			1
they think that people are caught unawares by the danger of being burned as they sit outside for longer and do not get so hot at this time of year			2
while there are warnings that an ozone hole will be over @entity0 over the @entity123 , cloudy weather is forecast , which will act as a filter to stop the worst of the uv rays getting through			1
the weather is expected to be cloudy and rainy next week			0
while it is important to protect skin against the harmful effects of sunburn , including premature ageing and an increased risk of skin cancer , experts have also stressed the health benefits of being outside so that our bodies get enough @entity139 being outside in the sunshine has also been linked to lower blood pressure and lowering the risk of a heart attack or stroke			2
skin cells detect uv light using a photosensitive receptor previously thought to only exist in the eye , according to a 2011 study			0
the receptors sense light and trigger the production of melanin within hours - more quickly than previously thought - in a rush to protect against damage to @entity156			0
' as soon as you step out into the sun , your skin knows that it is exposed to uv radiation , ' said senior author @entity161 , assistant professor of biology in the @entity163 at @entity164 in @entity165			0
' this is a very fast process , faster than anything that was known before			0
' scientists believe that melanin protects the dna in skin cells against damage from uv rays by absorbing the incoming radiation and while it is effective , it is n’t perfect , which is why people must use sun block to protect their skin			2
the study showed that the body mounts its defence much sooner than thought and well before it becomes apparent in the form of a tan			0
previously , scientists only knew that melanin production occurred days after uv radiation had already begun damaging dna .			0

a hole in the ozone layer over the @entity0 is allowing high levels of ultraviolet rays to travel through the @entity20 's stratosphere
the ozone layer usually prevents most harmful rays reaching people , protecting them from sunburn and skin cancers
@entity53 warned there ’s more sunburn at @entity57 than in june
advised people be careful in the sun at peak times between 11am and 3pm
warned damage is being done even when it does *n't* feel hot
