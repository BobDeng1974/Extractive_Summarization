by @entity0 cricket is once again facing up to the spectre of corruption with the recent one - day international series between the @entity5 and @entity6 set to be investigated over allegations of wrongdoing			1
suspicious betting patterns were identified during the low - profile five - match series , which concluded on thursday , while unusually slow run - rates during certain overs followed by bursts of high scoring have ‘ set alarm bells ringing ’ , according to industry experts			1
concerns have been raised , in particular , around the tied third match of the series played in @entity20 a week ago on friday , as well as the final game , which resulted in a last - ball win for @entity6 on thursday			1
investigation : @entity6 celebrate winning the five - match series @entity25 : @entity6 leg - spinner banned for life by @entity28 in june 2012			1
found guilty of ' pressurising ' @entity29 into accepting cash to concede a number of runs in game against @entity34 @entity29 : @entity36 bowler banned from first - class cricket until 2017			1
jailed for four months for spot - fixing in a one - day game against @entity34 in 2009			1
can play club cricket next year the second odi , which saw @entity6 fail to score a run off the bat in the first five overs after being set 233 to win , will also be looked at			1
one betting website reported unusually large sums of money — said to run into several millions of pounds — being wagered between innings on a tied result during the third odi after the @entity5 were set 230 to win from 50 overs			1
@entity6 appeared to be cruising to victory , with their opponents still requiring 45 off the last 21 balls and only three wickets left			1
but with the tail - enders scoring at more than four times the rate of most of their team - mates , @entity5 scraped the unlikeliest of ties			1
field placings for the final over , when no 11 @entity65 and fellow tail - ender @entity66 crashed 14 off six balls from @entity68 , will be scrutinised by officers of the @entity70 and @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , along with a failed run - out bid off the last delivery			1
baffling : the field placings of @entity76 ( left ) have been called into question television commentator @entity78 , the former @entity5 fast bowler , said at the time : ‘ there is no way , no way , that you can convince me , whatever happens to this last ball , that @entity68 and @entity84 have had this field right to the length they have been trying to execute			1
there is no one who can convince me of that			0
’ the fifth odi , which saw @entity6 win by four wickets off the final ball , is also to be scrutinised			1
@entity72 officers will also analyse patterns on spread - betting sites around the first 18 balls of the @entity5 innings when only one run was scored			1
‘ there were suspicious betting patterns on a betting exchange , ’ said betting expert @entity100 , the author of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104			2
‘ a suspicious pattern , simply , is a flood of money wagered on an outcome just before it happens			0
there were some noticeable examples of this during the @entity5 - @entity6 series			1
in the tied match , a weight of cash arrived on the tie market before @entity6 ’s innings			1
’ another passage of play , between the 29th and 34th overs , when experienced @entity5 batsmen @entity125 and @entity126 were at the crease , will also be analysed in an effort to understand why just two runs were scored from five overs before 16 were hit off the 35th over			1
putting the brakes on : @entity126 ( above ) slowed things down batting with @entity125 @entity72 investigators , who have been criticised in the past for failing to root out deep - seated corruption in cricket , will analyse betting patterns around those overs amid concerns that anyone with prior knowledge could have made a certain profit in the market for run predictions , which are usually based on totals in five - over ‘ brackets ’			1
the same process will occur for the second odi			2
in may 2008 , @entity126 was suspended for two years			0
the @entity149 said he had ‘ received money , benefit or other reward which could bring him or the game into disrepute ’			0
they looked into charges that @entity126 had passed on team information to a bookmaker during a one - day series in @entity161 in january 2007 , which he denied			1
@entity163 to any investigation will be to establish a link between illegal bookmakers , normally working on behalf of billionaire businessmen in @entity161 or the @entity167 , and the players			0
the @entity72 have the power to access a player ’s bank records and analyse mobile phone data			0
deleted text messages can be accessed through improved data retrieval methods			0
‘ players know we are on the look - out for wrongdoing , but they also know it ’s like looking for a needle in a haystack , ’ said an @entity70 source			2
the @entity70 and their constituent governing bodies have introduced education programmes in recent years to warn players of the dangers of getting involved with the murky underworld of black - market betting and reminding them of the potential punishments if they are caught			1
the @entity28 have looked to identify so - called ‘ court - siders ’ at county games who have the opportunity to interact with players , potentially garnering information about pitch conditions and teams			2
strict limits on the processing of mobile data at county grounds have also been implemented in an effort to stop ‘ court - siders ’ passing real - time information on to bookies			2
last week , two individuals were ejected from the @entity207 game between @entity208 and @entity209 at @entity210 after being caught by @entity28 anti-corruption officials phoning live commentary to the sub-continent			0
the nine - second time delay between live action and the tv broadcast in @entity161 is enough for ‘ market manipulation ’			2
the @entity28 say there have been 17 incidents this season , with 14 individuals removed from 13 different county grounds and they are putting pressure on broadcasters to reduce the gap between real - time action and when it is broadcast ‘ live ’			2
in the spotlight : @entity229 games have seen 14 individuals removed this year banned : @entity232 trio ( left to right ) @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 were found guilty of spot - fixing in a test match against @entity238 at @entity239 in august 2010 @entity240 the tournament has been shrouded in controversy since its inception and , in may this year , its reputation hit a new low when three players — @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 — were arrested on suspicion of spot - fixing			2
so far 11 bookmakers and other associates have been arrested			0
one of those held in @entity254 was actor @entity255 ’ @entity256			0
he led the police to @entity258 , a top official of @entity259 and son - in - law of @entity261 in @entity161 president @entity262 another lucrative @entity207 event engulfed by controversy			2
in may the @entity70 began investigating the tournament , and some @entity268 players and umpires who took part in the @entity271 have since been questioned , while @entity273 captain @entity272 has admitted his part in fixing a game			0
the @entity276 hired the @entity70 ’s anti-corruption team for an investigation in 2013 after @entity279 , a former international spinner , was found guilty of spot - fixing in the 2012 competition and was then banned indefinitely			2
county cricket @entity29 ’s conviction for spot - fixing in @entity36 ’s @entity286 game against @entity34 in 2010 brought the reality of corruption to the heart of @entity268 cricket			0
a 2011 game between @entity292 and @entity293 remains the subject of a continuing investigation			0
with more county cricket now being televised in @entity161 , and a rise of ‘ mercenary ’ players moving from one global tournament to another with little or no team loyalty , the threat of corruption has arguably never been greater			0
in may , six illegal bookmakers were arrested by @entity305 police for their alleged role in fixing matches during the lucrative @entity240			0
since then , liquidity in the @entity310 market , largely driven by money from cricket - obsessed @entity161 , has dropped ‘ dramatically ’ , according to one industry insider			0
@entity72 investigators face a tough job to establish a link between on - field behaviour and insider trading			0
many markets are almost impossible to track , with trades carried out illegally in @entity161 and the @entity167			0
the @entity70 are expected to request more detailed information from legitimate bookmakers to try to identify potential wrong - doing surrounding @entity5 v @entity6 , though with many online firms registered offshore for tax purposes , they are not obliged to provide information on their customers ’ activity			1
spot of bother : @entity305 bowler @entity247 is caught up in fixing claims a ‘ memorandum of understanding ’ exists between sites such as @entity310 but they do not come under the remit of the @entity334 , which requires high street bookmakers in the @entity336 to notify the publically owned @entity337 as well as the respective governing body of any suspicious behaviour			0
the @entity70 ’s anti-corruption unit were approached for an official statement but replied : ‘ it is our policy not to comment on any investigtion , ongoing or otherwise			0
’ @entity310 declined to comment , while a @entity347 spokesman said : ‘ we have no knowledge of an @entity70 investigation			0
’ the @entity149 were unavailable for comment .			0
