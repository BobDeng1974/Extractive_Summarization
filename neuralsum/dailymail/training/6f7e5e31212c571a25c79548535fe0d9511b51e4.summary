i was 38 when i finally hung up my boots , so i marvel at the longevity of @entity4 ’s @entity3 , the @entity5 of football			1
sir @entity7 played till he was 50 , and @entity3 is the modern - day equivalent			1
as you get towards the end of your career , you need sheer bloody - mindedness to carry on			2
there is an element of not wanting to let go , and there is always a new generation of players coming along			0
you do n’t want to miss out			0
he burst on to the scene at the perfect time			0
it was the start of the @entity38 era and sir @entity39 was just hitting his stride			1
when @entity3 started off , he used to run at breakneck speed , and it was that sheer pace — allied to superb close control — that meant you needed to stop him in the first few strides			1
@entity3 was then intelligent enough to overcome the loss of a yard of pace , as without a great brain he would n’t have been able to extend his career			1
he showed a real calmness in the second half of his career and was very effective at keeping things simple			0
players can always get better and operating more centrally allowed him to use his vision to the full			0
he became king of the assists			0
during the mayhem of those @entity60 versus @entity4 games , i always found him a perfect gent			1
there was never a raised voice or tackle in anger , he just got on with his job			0
perfect gent : @entity69 's @entity68 , pictured here tussling with @entity3 in 1998 , enjoyed his battles with the @entity71 new role : @entity3 will serve as @entity74 's assistant after a spell as interim manager winning : @entity3 celebrates @entity4 's league triumph with @entity78 and @entity79 in 2008 he has always conducted himself with dignity , although he must have that steeliness to have survived at the top for so long			1
in terms of the pantheon , it ’s hard to put anyone in the @entity38 era above him			2
and in terms of trophies , he ’s certainly no 1			0
i certainly thought he ’d have retired long before sir @entity39 , that ’s for sure ! @entity93 people always ask me about that goal @entity3 scored against @entity60 in the 1999 @entity97 semi-final replay at @entity98			2
what people never notice is the great decoy run made by @entity102 , which i had to follow			0
that run gave @entity3 the room to weave his magic			2
it was a great goal , but i probably should still have stopped it ! stunner : @entity68 believes he should 've stopped @entity3 scoring this memorable @entity97 goal against @entity60 in 1999 magic moment : @entity3 celebrates his memorable solo strike against the @entity112 by whipping his shirt off			1

@entity3 *announced* his retirement on *monday* after being confirmed as @entity4 's new assistant manager
@entity24 has *signed* a three - year contract to become @entity4 boss
@entity68 believes @entity3 is one of the greatest @entity38 players ever
