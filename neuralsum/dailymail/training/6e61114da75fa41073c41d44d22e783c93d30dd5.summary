@entity1 referee @entity0 found himself at the centre of a bitter storm between @entity4 and @entity5 last night ahead of taking charge of the first knockout game of the tournament in @entity9			1
@entity0 , who came in for some criticism in the wake of the last @entity13 final , faced further questions from the @entity5 , who fear he may not be strong enough not to favour the host nation			1
@entity18 star @entity17 said : ‘ what worries me most about this game is the referee			1
’ the @entity5 @entity23 president is also reported to have expressed concern that @entity0 would buckle under the considerable pressure at the @entity26			1
when @entity4 manager @entity37 was told by a @entity5 journalist that @entity5 ’s ‘ president and players are worried ’ , a ranting @entity50 intervened			1
‘ we ’ll talk about it only once , ’ he said as @entity37 and @entity4 captain @entity51 looked on			1
‘ it ’s something that ’s immature			0
this kind of pressure is ridiculous			0
‘ talking about this is not a lack of respect to @entity31 or the referee or the people who work here with 100 years of winning history			1
it ’s a lack of respect to the @entity4 people			2
‘ we do n’t need a referee to win a match , it ’s insulting			0
that ’s all the @entity71 will say on the matter			0
’ contentious : @entity4 were awarded a dubious penalty in their opening game against @entity76 as @entity77 went down big dog : @entity0 took charge of the @entity13 final in 2010 but was criticised by the @entity82 media experience : @entity0 has already covered the @entity86 v @entity85 game at this @entity13 it did nothing to ease the tension before what is a huge game for @entity4			1
@entity37 spoke of ‘ anxiety and nerves ’			0
@entity51 said all the players were suffering under a burden of expectation playing a @entity13 here in @entity4			2
he said it was only because of @entity37 — their rock as well as their coach — that they were ready for what promises to be a fascinating encounter with the much - fancied @entity5			2
‘ it ’s impossible to shut off what this means , ’ said the @entity105 defender			0
‘ but this guy beside me is very special for us , even at a difficult moment , family issues , he ’s always there for us			0
in fact i need to stop talking because i ’m a big cry baby and it might happen here			0
’ friends : @entity51 was very big on his praise for the @entity4 boss ahead of their last 16 tie			2

@entity5 fear @entity0 is *n't* strong enough
@entity17 : ' what worries me most about this game is the referee '
@entity37 hits back saying comments are : ' a lack of respect to @entity4 '
@entity51 almost in tears talking about @entity37 *'s* influence
