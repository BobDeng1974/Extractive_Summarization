a £ 200million @entity1 skyscraper which melted cars by reflecting sunlight has been fitted with shading			2
the concave design and mirrored glass of 20 @entity7 , which is more commonly known as the @entity8 due to its distinctive shape , had caused the sun to shine powerful , focused rays of light onto the street below			1
but workers have fitted the 37 - storey building , which has been nicknamed as the ' @entity16 ' by those who work nearby , with a ' sunshade ' to deflect the rays			1
he turned to his car after an hour and found the wing mirror and panels had been damaged			2
parts of the car had ' buckled ' and there was a smell of burning plastic			2
he said at the time : ' they ’re going to have to think of something			0
how can they let this continue ? ' while heating and air conditioning engineer , @entity46 , said his @entity44 suffered a similar fate the day before			0
he said : ' the van looks a total mess – every bit of plastic on the left hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted , including a bottle of @entity57 that looks like it has been baked			0
' the building has been nicknamed the ' @entity16 ' by nearby workers who faced being glared by the sun in a particular patch of the street at the same time of day it is thought the distinctive shape of the ' @entity8 ' , which was designed by architect @entity65 and cost over £ 200 million , caused the sun to reflect intense rays the damage caused to @entity28 's black @entity29 after he parked it in eastcheap last summer			1
joint developers @entity72 and @entity73 reportedly paid out £ 1,000 in compensation to motorists who had their cars damaged by the sun blinding : @entity28 with his @entity29 , which was damaged by bright light reflected down from the tower further damage : the seat of a bicycle parked near the building was also allegedly singed by the blinding rays due to it 's concave design , sunlight was reflected into a very localised point in the early afternoon			1
pictured a man is bathed in light from the building my eyes ! city workers out for a cigarette pull amusing expressions as they see the light it is an architectural feature which reduces heat gain by deflecting sunlight			2
they can range from patterned concrete walls to a wing - like mechanism			2
it is usually a horizontal projection extending from the sunside facade of a building			0
nearby shops were also damaged by the intense sun rays			0
one shopkeeper said the glare caused his doormat to start smoking and scorched a lemon , another said it blistered paint - and one journalist even managed to fry an egg with the startlingly bright rays			1
@entity118 , of @entity120 barber 's , said the position of the sun at a certain time of the day caused a searing bolt of sunlight to start a small fire and burn a hole in his company doormat			1
he said : ‘ we were working and just saw the smoke coming out of the carpet			0
we tried to cut the fire down , there were customers in at the time and they were obviously not happy			0
‘ customers are not going to come in if there is a fire in the front of the door			0
’ joint developers @entity72 and @entity73 investigated and as a precautionary measure suspended parking in three bays in the area			1
it also installed a temporary screen before a permanent cover was installed this year - known as a ' brise soleil ' sunshade			1
the developer , which reportedly paid out £ 1,000 in compensation , said : ' it will not interfere with the customer fit - out or occupation			0
the cost involved has not altered our original estimated total cost of the building			0
' unbelievable : an egg is fried in intense sunlight reflected from the @entity8 building , in eastcheap in the @entity163 , where sun light reflected from the building melted part of a @entity29 car problems : tiles melted and a doormat caught fire after being hit by the rays reflected from the @entity8			1

the concave design of 20 @entity7 is thought to have caused sun to shine directly onto street below
the 525ft tall building has been fitted with a permanent *solution* - the ' brise soleil ' sunshade to deflect sunshine
several motorists had reported problem after parking car near the @entity8 - nicknamed @entity16
joint developers @entity72 and @entity73 investigated and suspended parking before installing shade
