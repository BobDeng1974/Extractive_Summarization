by @entity0 published : 23:35 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 00:22 est , 10 july 2013 battling out of his seat , @entity2 's ribs hurt so much he thought they were broken , but what struck him most about seconds after @entity5 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of @entity9 airport was the silence			1
none of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken @entity14 , no one from the cockpit announced anything - and now previously unseen pictures taken by @entity2 in the confused aftermath have been released by the @entity20			1
ignoring his pain , @entity2 , 39 , rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed - losing its entire tail section			1
escape : in this saturday , july 6 , 2013 , photo provided by passenger @entity2 , passengers from @entity5 , many with their luggage , wait on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at @entity36 ' we were left on our own , ' said mr. @entity2 to the @entity38			1
' there was no message from the pilot , from the crew - there was no one			2
' @entity2 ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door , despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane			1
the wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach - making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway			2
deciding not to exit the @entity14 through that exit , @entity2 , who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer , moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be			1
survivor : @entity66 speaks about being aboard @entity5 , which crashed on saturday , july 6th , 2013 , at @entity36 , during an interview at his office in @entity9 , on tuesday , july 9th , 2013 @entity66 , ( right ) , poses for photographs with his wife @entity70 , as he wears a yellow ribbon put on by a firefighter on the tarmac for triage after @entity5 crashed on saturday he moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat - forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt			1
' she could n't move , ' said @entity2 to the @entity38			1
' there were two other guys			2
we could n't pick her up			2
' a firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered @entity2 and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane , which had now burst into flames			1
' people were pushing each other out			2
there was a lot of commotion			2
we got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out			2
i 'm so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly			2
' having landed at @entity9 many times before , @entity2 told @entity108 that he knew the approach was wrong			1
@entity110 : the flight crashed upon landing , and two of the 291 passengers aboard were killed collecting their thoughts : the passengers of @entity5 hug each other after having survived the terrifying crash on saturday as has transpired , this was pilot @entity121 - kooks first landing at @entity9 in a @entity14 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft , despite being an experienced @entity125 pilot			1
' when he realized that , he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late , ' @entity2 recalled in a phone interview with @entity108			1
' so we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again			2
and then we landed again pretty hard			0
' it felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely			0
he tried to correct , which probably helped			0
we would have hit the rocks			0
' as the plane 's belly skidded along the runway , @entity2 described the sheer terror inside			1
' it was surreal , ' @entity2 said			1
' a lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them			0
i was n’t believing it either			0
' taken to @entity147 , @entity2 was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family			1
' i am in pain , but not too bad compared to other people , ' he said , adding on @entity153 of his actions , ' just did what anyone in my position would have done			0
' help : in this saturday , july 6 , 2013 , photo provided by passenger @entity2 , passengers from @entity5 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the @entity36 despite @entity2 's assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found , the bravery of cabin manager @entity164 , the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised			1
another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped			0
@entity121 herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety , despite suffering a broken tailbone that she did n't know she had until she was finally treated at @entity9 hospital later			0
while it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of @entity5 survived , it is ' most likely ' that one of the the two @entity189 teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane			0
while a fire department spokeswoman said this on monday , authorities are not saying if it was @entity195 and @entity196 , both 16 , who suffered the tragic accident			0
head count : the survivors of @entity5 gather together on the tarmac of @entity36 after evacuating the @entity14 which crashed on landing on saturday ' the incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles , ' @entity202 , a spokeswoman for the @entity203 , said yesterday in an interview with @entity216			1
' most likely it was a fire vehicle , but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete			0
' and it has been revealed today that six of the 29 students on the flight who were headed to @entity226 as part of a summer camp are now stuck in limbo as their passports were destroyed in the crash			1
indeed , the tour organizer , @entity232 believes that the entire camp will be scrapped and the children will return to @entity189 in the next few days			0
' the students and parents are missing each other , ' he said to the @entity238			0
' they need a few days to recover			0
it ’s best for them to take a few days ’ rest before sending them on an airplane again			0
it would be scary for them			0
they ’re afraid to take an airplane right away			0
