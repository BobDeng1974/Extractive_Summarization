@entity0 are on course to comply with @entity2 ’s financial fair play rules after cutting their annual losses thanks largely to a big boost in domestic television money and cutting their wage bill			1
the club remains loss - making , for now , posting an annual deficit of £ 23million for the 2013 - 14 season in figures just published			2
that is half the sum they lost the previous season			0
but big increases in tv money as well as another leap in commercial revenues , bolstered by keys sponsors including @entity21 , mean @entity0 are highly unlikely to be adjudged to have fallen foul of @entity2 ’s @entity24 rules again			2
@entity0 have reported record revenues of £ 346.5million for the year ending may 31 , 2014 last year they were deemed to have broken the @entity24 rules as a result of including almost £ 47m of income in their accounts from sales of intellectual property , £ 22.45m of it to related parties			2
in laymen ’s terms , @entity2 took a dim view of @entity0 conjuring up income that could not be justified in order to attempt to balance their books			0
the accounts for 2013 - 14 notably include zero income from sale of any intellectual property after @entity0 vowed as part of their settlement with @entity2 not to repeat what they did last year			2
instead @entity0 recorded notable rises in all the traditional revenue streams of a football club , with match day income rising from £ 39.6m to £ 47.5m , @entity2 tv revenue rising to £ 31.3m from £ 24m , domestic tv income soaring to £ 101.9m from £ 64.3m on the back of the @entity57 ’s new £ 5.5bn tv deals , and commercial income jumping to £ 165.8m from £ 143m			1
city do not disclose the breakdown of where their commercial income comes from , and while large sums are believed to come from the @entity63 , where the club ’s owner @entity64 is based , @entity0 are also attempting to diversify their revenue streams via a network of global partners			0
the @entity21 club now expect to comply with @entity2 's @entity24 rules as the club ’s total income rose by 28 per cent to £ 346.5 million , the club ’s biggest single outlay , on wages , fell from £ 233m in 2012 - 13 to £ 205m last season , which equates to ‘ only ’ £ 561,764 per day			1
among the clubs who have declared their financial results for 2013 - 14 so far , @entity0 ’s wage bill now falls from being the biggest in the @entity57 to second biggest behind city rivals @entity81 , who had a comparative figure of £ 214.8m last season			1
it is not clear , however , whether all the staff who were counted in last year ’s figures are also counted in this year ’s figures or whether some of them have been hived off into a different company for accounting purposes			0
last year ’s accounts showed @entity0 had 222 ‘ football staff ’ including players and the latest account shows this has dropped to 112 staff			0
@entity100 ’s staff numbers have inexplicably fallen from 449 people a year ago to 314 in the latest accounts			0
@entity0 have halved their losses from their 2013 - 14 @entity57 winning season the most obvious explanation at a time of expansion for @entity0 and the opening of an impressive new campus would be that some staff are now paid via a different subsidiary company of @entity64 ’s global football franchise business - of which @entity0 is just one arm			1
city have confirmed to @entity116 that the ‘ missing ’ staff are now paid via subsidiary companies and @entity0 are billed for their services			0
the accounts suggest this accounting manoeuvre - entirely legal - reduced @entity0 ’s wage bill by around £ 10.8m year on year			1
the other reason the wage bill may have fallen is that last year ’s £ 233m included pay - offs to former manager @entity126 and some coaching staff			1
@entity0 ’s losses take into account a £ 16m fine from @entity2 for breaking @entity24 rules in their last accounting period and the latest numbers should mean that the full £ 50m initially imposed will not now be imposed ; two - thirds of it was conditional			1
@entity137 's side are second in the @entity57 , six points behind leaders @entity140 city believe they are in good financial shape to break even or even become profitable from the current season onwards			0
@entity0 ’s chairman @entity150 says : ‘ we have moved beyond the period of heavy investment that was required to make the club competitive again , it is commercial growth of the kind we are seeing today that will underpin and support our operations in the future			0
’ the accounts show @entity0 spent a net sum of £ 38.8m on summer transfers including @entity157 , even accounting for the sales of @entity159 and @entity160			1
@entity157 ’s transfer fee has repeatedly been reported as £ 32m but in fact was closer to £ 40m to three third - party owners combined .			0

@entity0 revenue up 28 per cent thanks to 2014 @entity57 win
results also show @entity0 no *longer* have biggest wage bill in @entity57
@entity0 's losses halved to £ 23million - of which 16m was a @entity2 fine
