a seriously - ill father who needs a double organ transplant to keep him alive is facing a second battle to stop his wife and daughter being forced to return to @entity5			1
forklift driver @entity6 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was diagnosed with a rare disease in september last year and has since faced an excruciating wait for a kidney and liver transplant			1
at the time , the 32 - year - old was living in @entity5 with 22 - year - old @entity15 , but he soon had to leave his wife and their baby daughter to return to the @entity19 for urgent dialysis treatment			1
but , in just five months , mrs @entity34 will be forced to return to @entity5 because she does not have the correct visa to stay in the @entity19 permanently - unless they can prove they have enough money to support themselves			1
speaking about the ordeal , mr @entity36 said : ' the time we spent apart were the hardest six months of my life			1
' @entity15 is keeping me positive all the time			2
we 're heading for an immigration aid group to see if they can help			0
' mr @entity36 met his wife while he was helping victims of the floods in @entity52 during a trip to @entity5			1
at the time , he had a visa as a skilled worker			2
after meeting the soon - to - be mrs @entity34 , he planned on starting a new life in @entity5			1
the pair married in december 2013 but their honeymoon was short - lived , as mr @entity36 had to return to the @entity19 the young family are now in the @entity19 together but mrs @entity34 only has a holiday visa to be here until march but he was diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type one - a rare condition affecting just one person per 1million - months later			1
mr @entity36 had surgery , but medics told him he would need dialysis until he has a double transplant			1
his sickness meant he could no longer have a sponsored @entity5 visa and mr @entity36 had to fly home in april , leaving his beloved family behind			1
at the time , @entity28 - who was born in march - was just six weeks old			2
he has since been receiving dialysis at the @entity31 for eight hours , three evenings a week			0
mr @entity36 was in hospital being treated while his 22 - year - old wife was pregnant ( left )			1
she gave birth to @entity28 in march this year ( right ) meanwhile , mrs @entity34 sold her belongings and flew to @entity19 to be with her husband			1
but mrs @entity34 is only in the @entity19 on a holiday visa , which says she must return to @entity5 in march 2015			1
because mr @entity36 lives in the @entity19 permanently , mrs @entity34 could to apply to obtain a ‘ family of a settled person ’ visa			1
but part of that application involves proving @entity36 and mrs @entity34 have enough money to adequately support and accommodate themselves and @entity28 without relying on public funds			1
mr @entity36 met his wife in @entity5 in 2013 after he had been in @entity52 , @entity91 , helping victims of the floods ( pictured ) primary hyperoxaluria type 1 - known as ph1 - leads to end stage renal failure			1
it is caused by the shortage of an enzyme ( alanine - glyoxylate aminotransferase ) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate - a chemical found in plant foods			2
without the enzyme , oxalate builds up leading to kidney stones			2
these stones can cause urinary obstruction , urine infection and eventually kidney damage and other organ failure			0
oxalate stones in @entity113 tend to be severe , resulting in relatively early kidney damage which impairs the excretion of oxalate			0
this leads to a further acceleration in accumulation of oxalate in the body			0
@entity122 can control renal failure but tends to be inadequate to dispose of excess oxalate			0
@entity127 ( kidney ) transplant is the primary treatment of severe hyperoxaluria			2
liver transplantation is also used to control the disease by correcting the metabolic defect			2
primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to occur in 1 per million people			0
government rules state that if the @entity19 resident is on disability allowance , the spouse does not have to prove they can not support themselves			2
but mr @entity36 can not obtain sickness benefit as he must be back in the @entity19 for 52 weeks before he can claim			1
guidelines say a spouse who is applying for a five - year visa must show they have £ 22,400 per year for themselves and one child			1
as mr @entity36 is unable to work , and mrs @entity34 is only on a holiday visa , the pair do not have an income			1
the couple - who are currently staying with mr @entity36 's parents , @entity152 and @entity153 - now face a race against time to try and keep their family together			1
mr @entity36 said : ' my mum and dad have been brilliant			1
i could n't ask for better parents			0
' my little girl and my wife are keeping me going			0
' mrs @entity34 's sister , @entity163 , has now launched a fundraising appeal for her brother - in - law			1
she wants to raise enough money so the family can live together in the @entity19			2
they also hope enough money is raised so mr @entity36 can have his treatment privately			1
mrs @entity163 said : ' all this family want is to be together , happy and healthy			0
' @entity171 has no job and no money			0
all he wants is to work and provide for his family but his body will not let him			0
' i am campaigning to raise awareness and funds for @entity171			0
' mr @entity36 said : we ca n't thank our family and friends enough for all their help and support			1
' @entity185 has contacted the @entity186 for comment			0
some people really get dealt with a heartbreaking story			0
my sister @entity15 and her beautiful family @entity171 and @entity28 have had far more than their fair share of bad luck			2
@entity171 has a rare disease causing kidney and liver failure - needing a transplant urgently			1
he was going through all the right channels to get sponsorship in @entity5 as a skilled worker when his continued worsened making him unable to work and was let go by the sponsoring employer			2
being a liability to @entity5 and urgently needing a transplant his citizenship of @entity5 was rejected ... he had to scrap together to get a ticket back to the @entity19 , after a long and stressful trip home ensuring he was able to survive the flight without dialysis - leaving his wife and 2 month old baby here in @entity5 he returned to the @entity19			1
@entity171 spend 6 months away from his love @entity15 and his baby girl @entity28			1
@entity171 missed 6 months of his daughters life - first tooth , standing up , her smiles and all of the other beautiful moments that ca n't be replaced			2
the only contact they had was skype			0
six months later my sister @entity15 was able to save enough with help from generous friends and family to go to the @entity19 for a while to visit her husband and reunite the family			1
the trip was n't ideal with an 8 month old baby to a foreign country , to top off the situation she was interrogated in customs and was almost declined entry into the country , as they assumed she was n't going to return to @entity5			2
along with this @entity171 was again struck down and was in the emergency ward			0
now 6 weeks in and life has been steady for this family - together everyday and enjoying the small things in life			0
@entity171 still waiting to be put onto the transplant list , his condition has worsened			0
making him unable to attend work as much as he would like and to provide for his family			0
today @entity171 was again let go as he was n't able to attend as require due to emergency hospital making him unable to work			0
@entity171 requires a minimum 3 x 5 hours of dialysis per week - 3 days a week and after dialysis he is drained and ill. unfortunate lately he has required to spend so many nights in hospital to be able to survive			0
with @entity171 not being able to work and @entity15 having just a visiting visa ( non-working ) as she was declined citizenship or a working visa due to having a baby they have no source of income and are literally unable to live			2
unfortunately they do n't have enough money to even pay board or food or even travel expenses getting to and from hospital			0
their families have done everything they can do for them and will continue to support them as much as possible within their means but unfortunately that does n't go far			0
please share and spread this post as much as possible			0
all i want is for my sister and her family to be happy and healthy			0
i hope that this becomes a post that reaches so many people that care and people that want a young beautiful family to be together			0
the future for this family is very uncertain and all they want to do is be together			0
please , if you are n't able to help please share this story ... thank you xx			0
