by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 08:11 est , 23 january 2014 former @entity3 systems analyst @entity2 who exposed the @entity3 practices a government taskforce that reviewed the @entity3 's surveillance programme for four months is urging president @entity7 to shut down the agency 's bulk collection of phone data and purge its massive inventory of millions of @entity13 ' calling records			1
the recommendation from the @entity15 to abandon the @entity3 's phone surveillance was even more sweeping than a similar proposal from another panel of experts			1
that panel , the @entity20 on @entity21 , advised @entity7 in december to restrict phone surveillance to limited court - ordered sweeps			1
the oversight board 's new 234 - page report - a copy of which was obtained by the @entity29 - contained several strong dissents from two members of the five - member board - former national security lawyers from the @entity34 administration who recommended that the government retain its broad phone surveillance authority			1
the board disclosed key parts of its report to mr @entity7 earlier this month before he unveiled his plans during a speech last week to the nation			0
in that speech , the president said the bulk phone collection program would continue for the time being			0
he directed the @entity46 and intelligence officials to find ways to end the government 's control over the phone data			2
and he narrowed the @entity3 's bulk collection by insisting on close supervision by a secret federal intelligence court and reducing the wide chain of calls that the @entity3 may track			1
phone companies have said they do not want to take responsibility for overseeing the data under standards set by the @entity3			0
@entity7 speaking about the @entity3 and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques at the @entity13 @entity46 in @entity63 on january 17 , 2014 president @entity7 shakes hands as he leaves the @entity65 of the @entity66 this week			1
a government taskforce that reviewed the @entity3 's surveillance programme for four months is him to shut down the agency 's bulk collection of phone data warning that the @entity3 's massive daily intake of calling records ' raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties , ' a three - member majority of the oversight board said the government should end the surveillance program and ' purge the database of telephone records that have been collected and stored during the program 's operation			1
' the board said the @entity3 should instead seek records directly from phone service providers using ' existing legal authorities			0
' the @entity3 's surveillance programs and other operations began coming to light last year - and drawing intense criticism - after revelations fueled by an estimated 1.7 million documents taken by former @entity3 systems analyst @entity2 and handed over to several journalists around the world			0
most controversial has been the @entity3 's collection of data on @entity13 ' telephone calls and internet messages			1
the @entity3 says it does not listen in on the phone calls or read the internet messages without specific court orders on a case - by - case basis as it tracks potential terrorist plots			0
along with its call for ending bulk phone surveillance , the oversight board report outlined 11 other recommendations on surveillance policy , calling for more government transparency and other reforms aimed at bolstering civil liberties and privacy protections			1
the board called for special attorneys to provide independent views in some proceedings before the secret spy court - as opposed to @entity7 's plan for a panel of experts that would participate at times			2
the board also urged the administration to provide the public with clear explanations of the legal authority behind any surveillance affecting @entity13			2
in danger : @entity2 took refuge in @entity132 to evade treason charges after disclosing @entity13 state secrets on @entity3 intelligence gathering , and now fears for his life and wants to increase security legal opinions and documents ' describing the government 's legal analysis should be made public so there can be a free and open debate regarding the law 's scope , ' the board said			1
both the @entity34 and @entity7 administrations have been criticized by civil liberties advocates and by tech industry officials for failing to provide clear public explanations of the decision - making behind their surveillance policies			2
' purge the database of telephone records that have been collected and stored during the program 's operation ' three - member majority of the oversight board while the oversight board found consensus in some of its recommendations for transparency , its members were sharply divided when it came to the surveillance programs and their judicial oversight			1
two members , former @entity34 administration @entity46 lawyers @entity169 and @entity171 , defended the bulk phone sweeps and said they were too valuable to shut down			0
' i am concerned about the detrimental effect this superfluous second - guessing can have on our national security agencies and their staff , ' said @entity179 , who as a @entity180 lawyer defended @entity182 legislation that provided the @entity3 with its authority to make the bulk phone collections			0
but the oversight board 's three other members - executive director @entity187 , former federal judge @entity188 and civil liberties advocate @entity191 - held firm for broad changes			0
' when the government collects all of a person 's telephone records , storing them for five years in a government database that is subjected to high - speed digital searching and analysis , the privacy implications go far beyond what can be revealed by the metadata of a single telephone call , ' the majority wrote			1
the oversight board was created in 2005 , urged by the independent commission on the 9/11 attacks as a key organizational reform needed to balance counterterrorism policy with civil liberties concerns			0
the board functioned fitfully for several years , often short on members because of @entity214 ' inaction			0
it finally won legislative approval last year for all five members and staff and took on its study of the @entity3 programs at the urging on @entity7 and congressional leaders			2
the @entity223 urged @entity7 to consider expanding the oversight board 's purview to include all intelligence operations			2
as part of that change , the @entity20 also wants the oversight board 's name changed to the @entity231 and @entity232			0
@entity233 has balked at that change , worried the group will become known as the @entity237 board .			0

government taskforce reviewed surveillance programme for four months
urging @entity7 to stop agency 's bulk collection of telephone data
also suggests purging inventory of millions of @entity13 ' calling records
