by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:05 est , 21 july 2012 updated : 20:50 est , 21 july 2012 one day after accusations that the @entity5 government has been infiltrated by the @entity6 leading to heavy criticism of @entity8 in both political parties , she 's not backing down			1
instead , the former presidential candidate has added a fellow congressman to her list of @entity5 suspects she believes needs investigating			1
rep @entity15 , the first muslim elected to congress and whom @entity8 shares the state of @entity21 with , has been added to her list of names			1
he said she should apologize to ms @entity30 for her accusations , coupled with four other @entity39 , that had zero merit			0
responding to that request , @entity8 voiced concern of @entity15 as well and suggested he be added to the list also			1
' he has a long record of being associated with ( the @entity45 ) and with the @entity6 , ' she told radio and tv host @entity47 on thursday night			0
@entity15 , addressing @entity8 's curt accusation , said it is false and believes the congresswoman who 's currently running for re-election just wants attention			1
questioned : @entity30 ( left ) , aide to @entity5 secretary of state @entity32 ( right ) , has been subjected to inquiry by @entity8 and four other fellow @entity39 for having ties to the @entity6 what rights : @entity58 questioned the high security clearance ms @entity30 has working for @entity32 which @entity60 chastised the congresswoman for ' i think she thinks that we 're evil because we do n't understand @entity64 the way she does , ' mr @entity15 told the @entity66			1
' it must be very frightening to see the world through her eyes			0
' it was only wednesday the typically press shy ms @entity30 made headlines instead of her husband , disgraced former @entity74 congressman @entity73			1
first , she and @entity73 appeared in a @entity76 spread where she declared that she is proud to be married to her husband even after the @entity79 sexting scandal that forced him to resign his position as a @entity82 representative for part of the @entity85 borough in @entity74			0
then she was a hot topic by @entity8 and other @entity88 politicians deriding her with claims that her deceased father , mother , and brother has connections to @entity94 's @entity6			2
calling her out : though @entity96 ( right ) never mentioned her explicitly , he gave a seven - minute speech slamming a letter that @entity8 ( left ) wrote deriding one of @entity32 's top aides ' the concerns about the foreign influence of immediate family members is such a concern to the @entity106 that it includes these factors as potentially disqualifying conditions for obtaining a security clearance , which undoubtedly ms @entity30 has had to obtain to function in her position , ' ms @entity8 wrote in a responding letter to mr @entity15 who called her claims baseless			1
' ... in questioning how ms @entity30 received a high - level security clearance , you imply that our top intelligence agencies did not adequately investigate ms @entity30 , ' @entity15 responded			2
' accusing the men and women of the @entity5 intelligence community of failing to do their jobs requires far more substantial information than what you have provided to date , ' he wrote			0
trusted : @entity8 says ms @entity30 's position is highly sensitive and she could abuse it , effectively because of falsified rumors about her @entity17 family 's connections @entity96 @entity130 senator @entity96 , like @entity15 , also came to ms @entity30 's defense			1
the former presidential candidate spoke passionately about ms @entity30 ’s years of dedicated public service in her role with secretary @entity32 , and denounced the senseless character attacks that were made by some of his more conservative party members			1
' @entity30 represents what is best about @entity5 : the daughter of immigrants , who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the @entity5 ideals that she embodies so fully			0
' @entity96 said in his speech on the @entity150 floor			0
' i am proud to know @entity30 , and to call her my friend			0
' @entity8 , who rose to national prominence during her failed bid for position of this year ’s @entity88 presidential candidate , alleged that ms @entity30 ’s deceased father , mother , and brother are connected to the @entity6 , the controversial political opposition group who often works against @entity5 interest in @entity163 states			1
touting her role on the @entity165 , representative @entity8 wrote a letter - which was co-signed by four other congressmen - alleging that given ms @entity30 ’s highly - sensitive position in ms @entity32 ’s staff , she is effectively a national security threat due to her fictitious connections to the @entity6			1
in the letter , which was sent to the deputy inspector general of the @entity175 and the director of national intelligence among others , mrs @entity8 and her co-signers gave no traces of evidence of their findings			2
stay at home dad : @entity73 has been taking care of his new son @entity184 while his wife @entity30 continues her high - powered job at @entity32 's top aide well connected : ms @entity30 has stood quietly by her husband @entity73 in the wake of his sexting scandal last year that lead to his resignation mr @entity96 made a clear attack on the statements , drawing on his own personal experience having been the victim of false rumors during his multiple presidential campaigns , and having his heroism questioned in spite of his strong military record which included many years as a prisoner during the @entity203			1
he said that he knows the pain that is cause ' when a person 's character , reputation and patriotism are attacked			0
' ' when anyone , not least a member of @entity212 , launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow @entity5 on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for , it defames the spirit of our nation , and we all grow poorer because of it , ' he said			0
‘ to say that the accusations made in both documents are not substantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and diplomatic about it			0
in the shadows : a then - pregnant @entity30 ( left in both shots ) was the one to hand @entity32 her @entity233 when the news came through that @entity235 had been killed defender : @entity96 dismissed the letter about @entity30 as reckless and said that he was honored to call her a friend ‘ the letter in the report offer not one instance of an action , a decision or a public position that @entity30 has taken while at the @entity175 or as a member of then - senator @entity32 's staff that would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti-american activities within our government			2
’ mrs @entity32 ’s staff clearly appreciated the bi-lateral support that he showed in renouncing the move			0
mrs @entity32 ’s spokesman @entity256 dismissed the accusations , calling them ' nothing but vicious and disgusting lies , and anyone who traffics in them should be ashamed of themselves			0
i would hope that hearing the remarkable statement from someone of senator @entity96 's stature gives her ( @entity8 ) pause in doing so any further			2
' in response , mrs @entity8 said that her words were being twisted and that the point of her letters was ' to outline the serious national security concerns i had and ask for answers to questions regarding the @entity6 and other radical group 's access to top @entity279 administration officials			2
