@entity1 manager @entity0 has praised @entity2 for emerging from a difficult loan spell with @entity1 to lead the line for @entity5 , but believes it is too soon for an @entity8 call - up just yet			1
@entity2 spent four months at the @entity9 in 2013 , but only played in three wins and mostly featured from the bench , scoring twice in 15 games			1
@entity1 suffered a late - season slump and only squeezed into the @entity15 playoffs with a last - minute winner on the final day before losing out to @entity17 in the semi-finals in dramatic circumstances			1
@entity0 has praised @entity5 's young striker @entity2 ahead of their @entity22 meeting @entity0 is impressed with how @entity2 , 21 , has responded in his career — with 13 goals in 22 games for @entity5 this season			1
‘ @entity2 came in at a difficult time for us and i think for him , ’ said the @entity1 manager			1
‘ we were in a terrible run then just as we are now			0
so it was n’t always easy for him , but he handled himself exceptionally well			0
‘ of course , he ’s a couple of years older now , with more experience — and as a very likeable and level - headed young man , as he was then , he ’s proved to be an outstanding talent			2
‘ people are even talking about the possibility of an international call - up			0
but again , let ’s keep things in perspective			0
he ’s doing very well for himself and for his club at the moment			0
‘ i ’d like to think he ’d look back on his time here as valuable , whether in terms of the appearances he made or of being able to deal with setbacks in football			0
but @entity0 feels the in - form forward is not quite ready for an international call - up @entity2 has scored a remarkable 13 goals since coming into the @entity5 side this season ‘ in hindsight you learn as much from the difficult times as you do from the positive			1
@entity2 was very popular and the staff rated him highly			1
’ meanwhile , @entity5 manager @entity60 has warned @entity61 that it will take more than a crowded festive fixture list to grant a return to the team			1
@entity61 scored 14 last season but has only struck twice since @entity60 replaced @entity67 at @entity68 in the summer and has not started a game for almost two months			0
‘ i will decide to pick him when he ’s ready , ’ said the @entity5 boss			1
‘ when he deserves to play , he plays			2
’ @entity60 has made it clear reputations count for nothing under his leadership			0
@entity76 and @entity77 are others who have been on the fringes while academy graduates @entity2 , @entity81 and @entity82 have thrived			2
@entity60 has warned @entity61 he will only regain his place in the side if he deserves it @entity2 seized his chance while @entity61 struggled with injuries and returned to @entity87 for personal reasons			2
‘ football pays when you work hard , ’ said @entity60 , on the subject of 21 - year - old @entity2			2
‘ we need to take advantage of the player ’s moment			0
