my teenage kids demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays			2
so , given their obsession with all things @entity12 , we decided on @entity13 this year - a classic @entity15 road trip along the @entity16 ( aka @entity17 ) from @entity18 to @entity19			1
we took our time ( three weeks ) to do it , but fitted so much in that i ca n't hang about now			2
@entity18 is known as @entity15 's most @entity23 city , you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july so here we go ... @entity18 is known as @entity15 's most @entity23 city , possibly because you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july			1
the mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the @entity28 most days can sometimes linger , but we never stayed still long enough to get cold			1
based in the funky @entity29 - where the foyer combines games room and bar , and is plastered with colossal photos of @entity34 and past guests of @entity36 - we spent three days hurtling around the city , often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the @entity42 's equally famous hills			1
we ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at @entity45 , we trawled the boutiques of @entity47 in search of the summer of love , we bussed out to the @entity50 , and we wondered at the aquarium in @entity52			2
@entity53 travelled to @entity15 with her teenage children , @entity2 , 15 and @entity3 who 's 17 and , fleeces on , we took the boat trip to @entity36 , which is not to be missed			1
the brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock			2
it 's an eerie and compelling tour			1
after trying to distil the city into only 72 hours , we climbed into our suv and headed for @entity17			1
it 's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between @entity18 and @entity19 , but this ( mostly ) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of @entity13 's most wonderful , ever - changing scenery			1
much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it 's time to take your foot off the gas , relax and take it all in			1
the kids said it reminded them of @entity81 as we headed south past @entity82 and then nipped briefly into @entity83 to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of @entity86 , the waterfront district made famous in @entity88 's novel of the same name			1
at @entity3 's insistence , we took a detour on to 17 mile drive , the scenic road around the @entity94 that leads to the world - famous @entity96 golf club			1
he was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there , but thrilled with the state of @entity102 and @entity103 , our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of @entity107			0
even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course ; secluded and tranquil , plush and green with a view of distant misty mountains			0
when the sound of silence got too much for us , just across the street at @entity118 there was the excellent and lively @entity121 @entity120 restaurant , and a wonderful deli too			1
leaving @entity107 , you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as @entity126 : wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild @entity16			1
the road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint - hearted			1
we stopped off at the @entity132 , in a baking - hot and silent valley , where the crash of the waves was replaced by the hum of insects and the call of the buzzards wheeling overhead			0
much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it 's time to take your foot off the gas , relax and take it all in this was a completely different wildness , underlined when @entity3 narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake			2
at the end of @entity126 you can encounter yet another type of wildness altogether in the form of the legendary @entity154 in @entity155			0
every bedroom is themed here - from @entity158 ( it 's a cave ) to @entity159 and the comparatively muted silver walls and flock wallpaper of our own @entity162			2
to call the @entity154 ' kitsch ' is to do it a huge disservice , because it takes everything to a whole new level of eyepopping taste			0
take the @entity169 , which puts the shocking into pink			0
the whole place is furnished and upholstered in a pink that is practically pornographic , softened only by the presence of enormous gold chandeliers			0
you have to see it to believe it			0
but the food and service were fantastic			0
the family nipped briefly into @entity83 to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of @entity86 , the waterfront district made famous in @entity88 's novel of the same name we took a rare detour off @entity17 to the @entity189 settlement of @entity190 , a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of @entity193 in the @entity13 sun , full of pastry shops and @entity197 tourists			1
a little unnerved by this , we headed back to the safety of the highway and soon found ourselves in @entity201			0
it 's the classic @entity13 of posters and t - shirts , with infinitely long palm - lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other			1
we stayed at the beachside end of one such thoroughfare in the aptly named @entity212			0
we found great seafood at the end of the pier at @entity216 opposite the hotel and at the fantastic @entity218 just a couple of blocks along @entity221			0
over the rail tracks behind the inn is @entity224 , where you can find everything from @entity227 's and @entity228 to tattooists and cavernous bars advertising @entity231			2
the @entity232 ' took a detour on to 17 mile drive , the scenic road around the @entity94 that leads to the world - famous @entity96 golf club the farmers ' market closes the street on a tuesday afternoon , offering up a @entity242 cornucopia of fruit , veg and other tasty treats			2
to the east of @entity224 is the @entity247 , an old industrial area that is regenerating itself into a haven of restaurants , art galleries and wine - tasting rooms			0
back on the road near @entity254 , you will see exotic animals on either side of the highway			2
floundering on the beach are gigantic elephant seals - enormous specimens of blubbery ugliness hooting and honking and generally having a riot at the edge of the sea			0
on the other side are zebras - direct descendants of the herd that press tycoon @entity269 installed at the magnificent @entity270 , which appears right ahead of you			0
you can take a tour of the castle and its grounds			0
after a 15 - minute coach drive up the snaking road to the top of the hill , you discover a spectacular mansion furnished with antiques and tapestries from all over @entity23 , andboasting roman baths , an enormous @entity284 marble swimming pool and its own private cinema			2
in the 1930s , @entity270 was party central for @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity291 et al			0
there are gold courses galore just outside the pretty little town of @entity107 having soaked up a bit of the @entity297 of @entity298 , we headed off on @entity17 again to see the @entity42 of today			1
there we stayed at the slick and sleek @entity301 @entity300 , choosing the beach - life of @entity300 and @entity303 over the urban sprawl of @entity298 or @entity305 where the car is king			0
the body - builders and gymnasts of @entity310 and the roller - blading buskers of @entity303 are highly entertaining , and you can actually walk everywhere			0
@entity298 is really an idea rather than a place anyway			0
it always seems as if it might be just around the next corner but it never is , and the @entity298 sign always stays aloof in the distance			0
we went on an excellent guided tour taking in the @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and other spots of note			0
a sunday trip to @entity328 was great fun , too , for the rides and a look at a real working film set on its day off			2
mind you , the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into @entity19			1
stop off for an guided tour taking in the @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and other spots of note in @entity19 unless you 're a professional stunt driver in a hurry , the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city 's more sedate boulevards			1
we drove the last 40 miles south through the @entity19 suburbs to our final stop at the @entity350			1
and what a beach it is - three - and - a - half miles of uncrowded white sand known as @entity354			2
it was thrilling to watch the guys surfing along on the waves			0
later we watched the sun go down over the pier from the comfort of the superb @entity361 , before ambling back along a beach glowing with fire - pits and shrouded in barbecue smoke - preparing ourselves for the horrors of donning fleeces again for the journey home			0
getting there @entity369 ( americansky.co.uk , 0843 6362001 ) offers an 11 - night self - drive @entity13 tour from Â£ 1,199pp			1
it includes room - only accommodation at a choice of hotels along the route from @entity18 to @entity19 , return flights with @entity379 from @entity380 into @entity18 and out of @entity19 , and 4wd car hire			1
