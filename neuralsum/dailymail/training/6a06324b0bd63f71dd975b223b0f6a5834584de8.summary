by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 @entity4 is storming ahead of all other major economies , with a new prediction for faster growth leading to claims the @entity4 is now the ' @entity9 of the global race '			1
the @entity11 said it now expects a 2.9 per cent rate of growth in 2014 , a major u-turn after previously warning @entity15 his austerity programme was ' playing with fire '			1
it means @entity4 is now on course to grow faster than any of the @entity20 richest countries , including the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , leading to the comparison with @entity26 gold medalist @entity25			1
the @entity11 said the @entity4 economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year , faster than any other @entity20 country chancellor @entity15 , on a visit to @entity31 this week , is delighted to see @entity4 punching above its weight only a year ago , the @entity11 heavily criticised the chancellor ’s economic plans and said he was ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with austerity policies			1
it cut its @entity4 forecasts to 0.7 per cent for 2013 and 1.5 per cent for 2014			2
but in a highly unusual mea culpa yesterday , its chief economist , @entity38 , admitted that the @entity11 ’s earlier prediction was ‘ too pessimistic ’			2
he conceded that the @entity4 economy grew by 1.8 per cent in 2013 and raised growth forecasts to 2.9 per cent for 2014			2
the latest @entity42 gives its backing to policies pursued by the chancellor and @entity47 governor @entity45			2
it puts @entity4 ahead of the @entity21 on 2.8 per cent , @entity22 on 1.7 per cent and @entity48 at 2.3 per cent			1
the new figures also upgrade @entity4 growth for next year though they still predict it will be slower than this year			1
‘ consumption and residential investment looked like a rather unbalanced way of growing but i think forward - looking investment seems to be coming back and growth is going to be more balanced , so indeed that is very good news , ’ mr @entity38 said			0
charts in the @entity11 ’s report suggest that @entity21 interest rates will start to rise in 2015 and that those in @entity4 will not be far behind			1
the bright forecast came as @entity4 ’s @entity63 produced data showing manufacturing rose strongly in february by 1 per cent , after losing some momentum in january because of the effect of heavy rain and flooding			1
in a further boost , the @entity70 said total economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the first three months of this year – the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2010			0
the @entity11 forecast is a major vindication for mr @entity15 after being warned he was ' playing with fire ' mr @entity15 , who is on an export drive in @entity31 , was clearly elated by the @entity11 projections			1
' it is good news that the @entity11 forecasts that @entity4 is to grow faster and has been upgraded by them by more than any other @entity84 economy this year , and that record numbers of jobs are being created , ' he said			1
‘ it is proof that the economic plan is working			0
but we need to do more to get exports and investment going			0
that is what the @entity93 was all about and that is what i am doing in @entity31 this week			0
' and it is clear today that the growth deniers in the @entity98 are intent on talking down the @entity4 economy - and that is the greatest risk to recovery			2
' remarkably , the @entity11 believes that the main risk to its new forecast is that the @entity4 will do even better than expected			1
it expects the @entity4 ’s economic renaissance to continue into 2015 , with gross domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power ahead by a further 2.5 per cent			1
@entity107 , chief economist at the @entity108 , said : ' the @entity11 ’s previous economic forecasts have been too pessimistic because they were convinced that cuts to state spending would have a serious negative effect on gdp growth			2
fortunately for @entity4 , this fear has proved to be misplaced			2
' and @entity115 , head of economic and social policy at @entity117 , said : ' @entity4 is now the @entity9 of the global race			2
' we are leading the rest of the developed world in terms of economic recovery but the race is a marathon not a sprint			0
' the flexibility of our labour market has enabled us to weather the economic downturn better than most other countries			0
but the challenge now is to raise our ambition still further			0
' but @entity98 's shadow chancellor @entity132 said : ' these forecasts are welcome news after three damaging years when the economy flatlined and growth forecasts were repeatedly downgraded			0
' yet millions of working people , who are on average £ 1,600 a year worse off since 2010 , are still not feeling any recovery at all			0
' official figures showed the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013 , the fourth quarter of growth in a row			0
another estimate of @entity4 gdp released today by the respected think tank the @entity70 suggested economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months ending in march			0
the @entity70 said the robust growth was relatively broad based			0
it forecast economic growth for this year of 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent for 2015			0
but it added that even though the level of economic output had almost regained its pre-recession peak , a sizeable negative output gap remains			0
the pound surged again on the news , having already seen a boost today from strong official manufacturing figures			0
@entity159 ticked higher versus the dollar to $ 1.675 - close to a 51 - month high of $ 1.680 set in february - having opening @entity163 trading at just $ 1.661			0
remarkably , the @entity11 believes that the main risk to its forecast is that the @entity4 will do even better than expected			1
the @entity11 expects the @entity4 ’s economic renaissance to continue into 2015 , the election year , with gross domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power ahead by a further 2.5 per cent			1
the upbeat @entity11 assessment of @entity4 ’s prospects will provide a boost to the chancellor , who is due to arrive in @entity3 on thursday			1
the @entity42 reports says : ‘ downside risks continue to dominate global growth outlook , notwithstanding some upside risks in the @entity21 , the @entity4 and @entity22 , ’ the @entity11 says the main risks are from ‘ low inflation and the possibility of protracted low growth especially in the euro area and @entity183 ’			1
nevertheless , the @entity11 forecasts that the recovery from the @entity185 will continue across the globe this year with output strengthening from 3 per cent last year to 3.5 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent in 2015 .			2

comes just a year after @entity11 warned austerity was ' playing with fire '
