by @entity0 @entity1 are notoriously incompetent when it comes to locating foreign countries on a map - even those where the world 's superpower is waging war			1
but it seems the deficiency cuts both ways , with many foreigners unable to identify where the 50 states of the union can be located , research has found			1
when asked to click their mouse on where they thought a state was located , most foreigners were only able to recognise @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , with most of the rest a mere blur			1
while the four states which appear most in @entity39 films and exported @entity1 television programmes were well recognised , and many knew at least whether a state was in @entity43 , when it came to the rest of the western , mid-western and southern states , results were abysmal			1
' @entity47 , @entity28 and @entity48 were all frequently confused with one another , while the placement of @entity51 stretched from @entity52 all the way to @entity54 , ' said @entity55 , @entity56 's ' chief armchair economist '			0
' @entity54 itself was often placed in @entity48 , or even @entity58			0
and almost nobody was able to locate @entity60 correctly			0
' he said that most respondents , whether or not they were right , seemed confident in their choice ' even when they were placing @entity64 somewhere around @entity65 , or relocating @entity66 to @entity67			0
' real - estate listings site @entity29 used an online game to ask 400 people from outside the to hover their cursor over each state as its name popped up the results will be pleasing for @entity1 , who have been globally mocked for their lack of knowledge of the world beyond @entity1 borders			0
a poll of about 500 young @entity1 aged between 18 and 24 conducted for @entity80 in 2006 found that 6 per cent were unable to even locate their own country on a map of the world			1
it also found that only just more than a third were able to locate @entity84 on a map of the @entity86 , despite the @entity1 staging a full - scale occupation of the country at the time			1
a study published in the @entity91 in 2009 which compared knowledge of international affairs among @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity1 found @entity1 citizens came consistently last			1
just 58 per cent of @entity1 knew who the @entity99 were , compared to three quarters of @entity95			0
however it did find that @entity1 were most likely to be able to identify @entity103 as the prime minister of @entity84 , with three in ten answering correctly , compared to just more than one in five of @entity95			2
more recently , a @entity107 experiment which set 1,000 @entity1 the challenge of completing their country 's citizenship test found 29 per cent could not name the current vice president and almost three quarters did not know what the @entity113 was about			2
in 2003 a @entity1 @entity116 abroad report warned that @entity1 ' ignorance of world affairs was so bad it amounted to a threat to national security			2
mr @entity55 concluded his report on foreigners ' knowledge of the 50 states by saying : ' whether at home or abroad , it seems like just about everyone could stand to brush up on their geography			0
