by @entity0 fancy a swim in a pool that has waves nine - stories high and currents four times faster than an @entity7 swimmer ? that ’s what awaits you if you stumble into the state - of - the - art wave pool named @entity13 at the @entity14			1
of course it ’s actually designed for engineers to test new technologies for wave turbines , rather than giving confident swimmers a run for their money			1
the heart of @entity13 is a 100 - foot ( 30 metres ) circular concrete basin containing the 82 - foot ( 25 metres ) diameter wave and current tank			2
the 16 - foot ( five metres ) deep tank contains 2.4 million litres ( 530,000 gallons ) of fresh water and is ringed by 168 absorbing wave makers			0
additionally , 28 submerged flow - drive units can simultaneously and independently drive current across the tank in any relative direction , with maximum current velocities of 5.2 feet ( 1.6 metres ) per second			0
a rising tank floor and overhead crane enable quick and easy installation of individual devices , or arrays of wave or tidal current generators			0
the pool is 82 feet ( 25 metres ) across and 6.6 feet ( two metres ) deep			0
it recreates waves and currents from coastlines around the @entity59 , @entity60 and beyond			2
its full name is the @entity29 and it can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet ( 28 metres ) high with currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres ( 530,000 gallons ) of water			1
the facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full - scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters			0
it can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects			2
by testing devices at scale in a tank , researchers can achieve milestones in days or weeks compared with months or years in open water			0
this accelerated development could bring clean energy products to market more quickly and cost - effectively , at lower risk			0
animation credit to @entity13 , @entity87 and @entity88 the pool can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet ( 28 metres ) high and currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres ( 530,000 gallons ) of water in an 82 - foot ( 25 metres ) diameter circular pool			1
here a crowd watches as the pool generates waves during a demonstration the pool can be used to generate fast currents and high waves			1
its currents can go as fast as an @entity7 swimmer while its waves can reach up to nine stories high			1
this allows underwater wind turbines and other technologies to be tested more easily than they can be tested at sea the £ 9.5 million ( $ 16.3 million ) @entity13 facility was funded by the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) and the @entity14			1
‘ we are delighted to mark the official launch of this pioneering facility , which will speed the development of devices to harness wave and current power , and further enhance the @entity14 ’s position as a centre of excellence in marine energy research , ’ said professor sir @entity111 , principal of the @entity14			2
professor @entity123 , chief executive of the @entity110 , added : ‘ @entity110 ’s investment in the @entity13 facility will help keep the @entity59 at the forefront of marine energy technology research and development			2
‘ @entity127 can accelerate the deployment of these technologies which , in turn , will help us meet our low - carbon targets , create jobs and boost growth			0
’ the facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full - scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters			0
it can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects one of the technologies that has been tested so far is @entity149 's model @entity147 device , which according to the @entity151 company is ' a radical new array - based wave energy convertor that captures energy from ocean waves and converts it into sustainable low - carbon electricity '			1

new ' pool ' at the @entity14 is being used to test technologies
called @entity13 in can be used to generate fast currents and high waves
currents are faster than an @entity7 swimmer with waves up to nine stories
this allows underwater wind turbines and other tech to be tested
the testing *process* is much quicker than doing the same thing at sea
could allow for a more rapid *turnaround* of new technologies in the *future*
