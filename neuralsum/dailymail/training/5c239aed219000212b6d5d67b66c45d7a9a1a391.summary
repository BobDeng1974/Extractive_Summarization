the @entity0 and @entity1 of @entity3 ’s beloved pet dog , @entity4 , is set to be immortalised in a series of children ’s books and toys			1
featuring a picture of the pampered cocker spaniel on the cover , the adventures of @entity4 the @entity13 : @entity14 of @entity15 , will hit bookshelves in september - with three further stories and a range of merchandise to follow			1
its author @entity20 took her inspiration from the frequent walks she enjoys with her own spaniel , @entity26 , in @entity27 , where @entity4 is also exercised			1
ironically given the new book deal , @entity42 and @entity1 ’s spokesman at first refused to even confirm their new pet ’s existence , saying it was a ‘ private matter ’ - even though the @entity46 and other dog - loving members of the royal family happily release details of their animals on the royal website			1
‘ we do n’t want to breach our own privacy , ’ an aide said			0
there was then another month - long stand - off after royal aides also declined to reveal the puppy ’s name			2
the @entity0 and @entity1 have created a number of companies to protect their ' brand ' from people trying to cash - in on their fame it eventually emerged after a seven - year - old boy simply asked the @entity1 when she visited a primary school in @entity69			0
after being handed a toy dog by young @entity71 , @entity1 said she would name it after her own pet , @entity4 , which means @entity4 in @entity74 and is a derivative of the @entity77 word for the animal			1
the pup now has its paws firmly under the table with @entity1 even telling one well - wisher who gave her a gift for the dog on the family ’s three - week tour of @entity87 and @entity88 last month that she was missing @entity4 terribly			1
‘ everyone gives presents for @entity91 but nobody knows how much i ’m missing my own dog , ’ she said			2
‘ this is the first present i ’ve received for my dog and i ’m really happy because i do miss him			2
he ’ll be really happy to have this to play with			0
’ the stuffed toy was then flown back to the @entity101 - @entity100 - with other official gifts			0
although somewhat overshadow by the birth of @entity105 , the @entity4 books will bring the royal pooch back under the spotlight			1
the series has been acquired in the @entity101 by international giant @entity109 , who also publish @entity111 , and describe it as a ‘ @entity112 for today ’s readers ’			0
it is hoped that a deal may be struck for the @entity117 rights to the book			0
in the first story @entity4 is accused of a serious crime he did not commit - an attack on a swan , which are protected under the @entity46 ’s charter			2
in his efforts to prove his innocence , he crosses paths with the dastardly corgi @entity136 - named after one of the @entity46 ’s actual pets , a corgi - dachshund cross known as a @entity130 - who has discovered a centuries old secret which he is determined to ‘ use against @entity133 and the crown ’			2
members of the @entity138 including @entity42 , @entity1 , @entity91 and the @entity46 , all make appearances in the book , but the focus is very much on the animals of the @entity144 and their adventures			0
miss @entity20 has now trademarked @entity4 with an eye to cashing in on the valuable merchandising market , putting his name on everything from action figures to bath toys , board games , cuddly toys and even scooters			1
the @entity156 details the escapades of the royal pets and features several members of the @entity138 the move to capture that market is particular interesting given the @entity163 ’s revelation earlier this year that the @entity0 and @entity1 had secretly set up firms to protect their own ‘ brand ’ and ‘ intellectual property rights ’			1
it enables the couple to sell officially - endorsed products and take action against anyone selling items that could harm their ‘ image ’			0
a @entity38 spokesman declined to comment on the book deal yesterday			0
privately educated miss @entity20 , 38 , says she has never meet @entity1 or @entity4 personally , although she frequently writes about walking with the royal pet or how his favourite food is toast on social media accounts such as @entity181			1
she insists the books were simply inspired by walking her own dog , @entity184 , whom she describes as @entity4 ’s ‘ girlfriend ’ , in @entity38 gardens in the spring of 2012			1
she said : ‘ i ’d seen in the papers that prince @entity42 and the @entity1 now had their very own @entity184 - a black cocker spaniel named @entity4 - and i started to think about what life as a royal puppy , with palaces and parks at your disposal , might be like			1
’ the royal family inhabits a ‘ secret ’ , behind - closed - doors world we never really get to see			2
could a series of books about a dog like @entity4 help children explore it ? ‘ over the next few months , the idea never strayed far from my mind			1
i began to see the scope for mystery and adventure - secret passageways and tunnels in royal palaces , portals to other times			2
a royal menagerie of characters began to form in my head			2
‘ first time author miss @entity20 has a tragic family history			0
her mother was a successful model and actress in the 1960s , who died of leukaemia when she was just 14			0
and in 2008 her property developer fiancée shot himself just five weeks before their wedding amid the collapse of his business empire			0
miss @entity20 , who recently re-married , says her dog , @entity26 , was instrumental in bringing joy back into her life			0
her agent @entity231 added : ‘ it is a really exciting and imaginative children ’s book that draws its reader into the imaginary world of @entity4 , the royal dog			1
‘ @entity237 has included fleeting references to the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity105 as well as other members of the royal family , but the focus is very much on the animals of the royal household - dogs , corgis , cats , mice and the like			0
we are very excited about the project			0
