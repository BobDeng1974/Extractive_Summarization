’ ’ he added : ‘ it is particularly difficult to get drivers and people to work in production			2
’ his comments came after the former boss of @entity33 , sir @entity34 , also attacked the work ethic of many @entity4 and said it was wrong to criticise immigrants prepared to work for lower salaries			1
sir @entity34 added : ‘ it is up to people to decide whether they want to do the work for the pay that is being offered			1
if they do n’t , somebody else is there to do it			2
what ’s wrong with that ? ’ the comments come amid fears that the @entity4 will see an influx of immigrants from @entity54 and @entity55 when working restrictions are lifted next month			1
last week @entity55 ’s @entity58 minister said @entity4 should be grateful so many @entity55 filled jobs @entity4 were unwilling to do			1
@entity60 said @entity55 migrants contributed ‘ greatly ’ to @entity4 ’s gross domestic product and criticised feelings of ‘ racism and xenophobia ’ towards her countrymen			1
sir @entity34 : ' there are a lot of people who complain about their lot ' his remarks came after sir @entity34 said @entity55 and @entity54 and other immigrants should not be blamed for coming to the @entity4 if @entity4 were not prepared to do menial jobs			1
he said : ‘ i ’m a free market economist – we operate in a free market			1
if these people want to come here , and work the hours they are prepared to work for the wages they are prepared to work for , then so be it			2
’ he added : ‘ i know people will look at me and say “ it ’s all right for you ” , but i started off with pretty well nothing , i did a lot of menial jobs when i was young			2
i did n’t worry about the status of the job – i was more worried about my self - esteem and the fact i had a job			2
in fact i would look myself in the mirror and say , “ i ’ve earned a few bob ”			2
sir @entity34 told @entity95 there were increasing signs the economy had turned the corner			1
he said : ‘ if you go outside of @entity10 , companies are recruiting again			0
there are real signs things are beginning to move			0
' we can argue about the quality of the recovery , but i think of it like a football match			0
a win is a win			0

anger : sir @entity34 's comments came after the @entity55 minister for labour @entity60 ( left ) said @entity4 should be grateful for migrant workers and attacked what she called ' racism and xenophobia ' ‘ many companies are preparing to re-invest			1
and it ’s wrong to say it ’s @entity125 , it ’s a @entity4 - centric thing			0

’ sir @entity34 , who is now the chairman of online grocer @entity129 , said @entity33 would have a good @entity130			1

‘ if you do n’t look out of the window every day you will look out one day and see the world has passed you by			0
and i think that ’s what happened to @entity132			0
‘ they worked hard expanding their business into a global presence and they milked the @entity4 too hard , using the cash from the @entity4 cow			0
‘ when they looked out of the window they realised the @entity4 was not as structurally sound as it could have been and they had n’t kept abreast of some of the trends			0
they found themselves wrong - footed			0
‘ catching up when you ’re wrong - footed is a massive task , but they have to keep going			0
it is still a fine business			0
