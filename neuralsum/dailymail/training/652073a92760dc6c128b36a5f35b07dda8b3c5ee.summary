@entity1 died of natural causes yesterday in the facility in @entity19 , @entity20 , where he was being treated for dementia , a @entity16 spokesman said			1
he had been the state 's oldest prisoner			2
@entity1 was on the @entity24 's list of most - wanted @entity26 war criminals until his arrest in @entity20 and conviction in 2010 on three counts of murder			1
during his six - month trial in @entity32 , @entity1 admitted killing three civilians as a member of the @entity36 - hit squad , a unit of largely @entity7 @entity2 volunteers responsible for reprisal killings of countrymen who were considered anti-nazi			1
' late justice often sends a very powerful message regarding the importance of @entity26 and @entity48 crimes , ' the centre 's top @entity26 hunter , @entity42 , said in a telephone interview from @entity50			1
' it 's a comforting thought to know that @entity1 ended his life in a prison hospital rather than as a free man			2
' @entity1 sat through his trial in a wheelchair and was regularly monitored by a doctor			2
he spoke little , but told the court in a written statement he had no choice but to obey orders to carry out the killings			1
' as a simple soldier , i learned to carry out orders , ' @entity1 testified			2
' and i knew that if i did n't carry out my orders i would be breaking my oath and would be shot myself			2
' at his trial in 2010 , @entity1 admitted killing three civilians as a member of the @entity71 hit squad but the presiding judge said there was no evidence @entity1 ever even tried to question his orders , and characterised the murders as hit - style slayings , with @entity1 and his accomplices dressed in civilian clothes and surprising their victims at their homes or places of work late at night or early in the morning			1
' these were murders that could hardly be outdone in terms of baseness and cowardice - beyond the respectability of any soldier , ' the judge said in his ruling			1
' the victims had no real chance			0
' @entity1 remained unapologetic to the end for his actions , saying that he had been proud to volunteer for the @entity2 , and that times were different then			0
born to a @entity7 father and @entity20 mother in @entity100 , @entity20 - on the outskirts of @entity102 moved to the @entity7 when he was an infant			1
@entity1 ( pictuerd at his trial ) was on the @entity24 's list of most - wanted @entity26 war criminals until his arrest in @entity20 and conviction in 2010 on three counts of murder in testimony during his trial , @entity1 said he remembered his mother waking him up the night in 1940 that @entity20 invaded the @entity7 and seeing @entity113 dive - bombers overhead			1
instead of fearing the @entity20 bombs , he said his family was elated as the attack unfolded			0
' ( my mother ) said ` they 're coming ' now things will be better , ' he told the court , before later adding : ' it was better			0
' after the @entity20 had overrun his hometown of @entity124 and the rest of the @entity7 , the 18 - year - old @entity1 saw a recruiting poster for the @entity2 , signed by @entity127			1
it offered @entity20 citizenship after two years of service and the possibility of becoming a policeman after that			0
he showed up with 100 other dutchmen at the recruitment office and was one of 15 chosen			0
' i was very proud , ' @entity1 told the court			0
after fighting on the @entity140 front , @entity1 ended up back in the @entity7 as part of the ' @entity71 ' hit squad			0
according to statements @entity1 made to @entity7 authorities after the war , he and a fellow @entity2 man were given a list of names slated for ' retaliatory measures			1
' @entity1 killed pharmacist @entity150 with a pistol in his pharmacy , then he and the accomplice killed bicycle - shop owner @entity154 when he answered the doorbell at his home			1
they forced the third victim , @entity158 , into their car , drove him to another town , stopped on the pretense of having a flat tire and shot him			2
' @entity158 fell against the garden door ... and sank to the ground , ' @entity1 told investigators			0
' blood shot out of @entity158 ' neck			0
' after the war , @entity1 managed to escape the prisoner - of - war camp where he was being held in the @entity7 and eventually return to @entity20			1
he was sentenced to death in the @entity7 in 1949 - later commuted to life imprisonment - but the case always seemed to fall through the legal cracks			2
the @entity7 sought @entity1 's extradition , but a @entity20 court in 1983 refused on the grounds that he might have @entity20 citizenship , and @entity20 at the time had no provision to extradite its own nationals			0
a state court in @entity32 ruled in 2007 that @entity1 could legally serve his @entity7 sentence in @entity20 , but an appeals court in @entity184 overturned the ruling , calling the 1949 conviction invalid because @entity1 was not there to present a defense			0
it was after the appeals ruling that a prosecutor in @entity192 quietly reopened the case , beginning from scratch and charging @entity1 with the three murders in 2008			2
during his trial , @entity1 told the court he was aware of the possibility he would be pursued by authorities , so much so that he never married			0
' i always had to consider that my past might catch up with me , ' he said			0
' i did n't want to inflict that upon a woman			0
