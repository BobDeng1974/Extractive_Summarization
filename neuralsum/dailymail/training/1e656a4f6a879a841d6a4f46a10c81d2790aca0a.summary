by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 17:15 est , 8 october 2012 six years after political scandal led to them announcing their separation , this is the picture that shows everything is back to normal for @entity8 ’s @entity7 and her husband @entity9			2
the pair were seen laughing and joking as they emerged from @entity13 ’s @entity12 home early in the morning after apparently spending the night under the same roof			1
an onlooker said : ‘ mr @entity9 came out first , and moved his car to by the front door so she could get in for a lift			0
they were both very jovial together , laughing and smiling			0
together once more : @entity9 and dame @entity7 emerge from her @entity12 home last week			1
the couple appear to be back together six years after they separated ‘ it looked very much like he had slept there overnight			2
’ it comes a fortnight after @entity13 , 65 , revealed that the pair , who have two grown - up children , had rekindled their romance			1
the mp for @entity34 , @entity35 , announced the split in 2006 , amid growing claims in @entity38 that tax lawyer mr @entity9 accepted a £ 350,000 bribe in return for providing false testimony for @entity43 in two corruption trials targeting the then @entity38 premier			1
split : mr @entity9 is seen arriving with his wife at the couple 's @entity12 home in 2006 shortly after allegations he took a £ 350,000 bribe from @entity43 came to light @entity13 had signed documents for a huge loan taken out on the marital £ 1million home in @entity12 – only for the loan to be repaid shortly afterwards , allegedly with the ‘ bribe ’ money			1
she maintained she was unaware of the payment mr @entity9 , 67 , received from mr @entity43 , but the controversy called into question her position as culture secretary			0
it worsened when it emerged mr @entity9 had used her @entity66 position , and their friendship with @entity69 , the then prime minister , to try to fend off the corruption claims			2
an official @entity66 inquiry criticised @entity13 over her behaviour , but mr @entity69 cleared her of wrongdoing			1
mr @entity9 was first convicted in @entity38 courts of taking a bribe from @entity43 – then cleared on a technicality			0
although they sold their house following their split , with mr @entity9 moving to @entity81 and @entity13 to a flat in @entity83 , they never divorced , and there had since been regular claims that the two were repeatedly seen together			1
but during an interview on radio 4 show @entity89 last month – days after her decision to step down from the @entity66 and not long after she received her damehood – she firmly denied that the separation had been a fraud designed to save her career			1
she said : ‘ what mother is prepared to look her children in the eye and say , “ we are splitting up			0
but , you know what ? it ’s not real ”			0
’ of their split , she added : ‘ he reached the view that life was intolerable while we were together and , as he put it to me , “ you ’re my problem , i ’m your problem ” and we separated			2
’ but revealing how there had been a rapprochement , she said : ‘ @entity9 has his house in the country and i have my house			0
we see each other regularly and we have time together which i really treasure as a family			0
we have reached a state of stability which i never thought possible			0
