@entity0 will play @entity1 in the @entity3 semi-finals , meaning @entity4 will return to the @entity5			1
@entity4 , who spent four trophy - filled years at @entity0 , took over at @entity1 in 2013			1
in the other semi-final , defending champion @entity6 will face @entity9 , with the @entity11 champions playing at home first			1
the four teams have combined to win the @entity3 or @entity3 21 times , with 16 runner - up finishes , in the competition 's 60 - year history			1
the first legs will be played on may 5 - 6 , with the return matches on may 12 - 13			2
the final will be played on june 6 at the @entity21 in @entity22			1
here 's how the draw unfolded ... host commentator how about that , then ? @entity4 will return to the @entity5 in the semi-finals with his @entity1 team			1
many would have wanted this as the final			0
personally , i think it 's much better that @entity4 goes back to @entity33 rather than a final at a neutral venue			2
@entity6 vs @entity9 is the other tie			1
the possibility of an @entity39 final and a second straight all @entity41 final on june 6 is still there			1
that 's all from me this morning , though			0
@entity0 vs @entity1 @entity9 vs @entity6 ties to be played on may 5/6 and may 12/13 @entity6 @entity9 @entity1 @entity0 @entity45 will play @entity46 and @entity47 will face @entity48 in the semi-finals of the @entity50			1
that draw has just been made			0
time for the main event , then			0
do n't blink ... this will be quick			0
we 're all ready for the draw to to start then			0
@entity56 will make the @entity50 semi-final draw first			1
join me here for live coverage of that before the main event shortly after			0
it 's been everything you 'd expect from @entity0 really			1
they topped their group ahead of @entity66 before @entity67 and have made light work of @entity69 and the @entity71 champions in the knockout rounds			0
@entity74 , they are starting to look like the team to beat around @entity76 again and that front three of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are awesome			0
@entity66 are the team who knocked @entity82 out , but @entity0 dismantled them 5 - 1 in the quarter - finals			2
it was all plain sailing for @entity4 's side , right up until their quarter - final tie with @entity88 that is			2
@entity1 set off in their quest to regain the title they won at @entity91 in 2013 by topping a tough @entity92 , which featured @entity69 , @entity93 and @entity94 , with five wins out of six			2
they showed no signs of letting up in the last 16 as well , thrashing @entity97 7 - 0 at the @entity98			0
but the last eight was a different story			0
@entity1 fell to a shock 3 - 1 defeat in @entity88 in the first leg and needed something close to a miracle to go through			2
what they got was five goals in a sensational first half on their way to a 6 - 1 second leg victory			0
today , they could be drawn against @entity6 , as they were last year , or @entity4 could return to the @entity5 to take on @entity0			1
@entity9 are by far the least glamorous side left in this season 's @entity3			1
they are well on their way to another @entity116 title , and their @entity76 campaign this season has been just as efficient if a tad unspectacular			0
@entity9 finished second in @entity119 behind @entity120 , just edging @entity121 into third place			2
but their 5 - 1 aggregate thrashing of @entity124 in the last 16 went under the radar , as did their 1 - 0 win over @entity129 's conquerors @entity130 in the previous round			2
@entity9 are a team not used to losing many games , and will be a tough draw for either of the other three sides			2
it 's been a season of two halves for @entity6 , and their path to the last four of the @entity3 is a perfect reflection of that			1
the 2014 winners were an unstoppable force before @entity67 and won 22 games in a row in all competitions , including all six matches in a group that featured @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
it 's been a different story in 2015 , though , and their progress through the knock - out rounds has been far from convincing			0
in the last 16 they were made to hang on by @entity156 , who inflicted a shock 4 - 3 defeat at the @entity159 after @entity6 cruised into a 2 - 0 lead in the away leg			0
in the last round , an 88th - minute strike from @entity163 was all that separated them and local rivals @entity120			0
with the @entity167 title race firmly in @entity0 's hands , @entity6 will once again be looking to the @entity3 for success this season			1
@entity171 : sorry @entity172 , but @entity0 vs @entity6 is the dream @entity3 final it 's a pretty tough question to answer ... so we picked the brains of our team of experts			1
as you can see , even our reporters ca n't even agree ... our reporters have their say on @entity184 will win the @entity3 plenty of build - up to this morning 's draw on the front pages of the national press in both @entity41 and @entity11			1
the feeling in @entity41 is that @entity9 are the team to draw			2
as have also listed the number of times each of these four teams have won the trophy - 21 cups between them from 37 finals			0
the @entity11 press seem to have a ' bring it on ' message for @entity9			0
they also look forward to @entity48 and @entity45 in the @entity50 draw a little later			0
ahead of today 's draw , our live football man @entity201 has compiled an ultimate lowdown on each of the four teams remaining in the draw			0
you 've still got time , so why not have a read ... as @entity6 , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity9 meet in the @entity3 semi-finals , @entity210 gives you the lowdown on the final four this morning , then , we will move one step closer to discovering our line - up for the final of this year 's @entity3 final at @entity22 's @entity21 on june 6			1
the first leg of the semi-finals will take place on may 5/6 with the second leg a week later on may 12/13 and , regardless of today 's draw , we should have some intriguing scenarios			1
will @entity79 have to face either @entity222 or @entity223 again ? will @entity224 come up against his former team ? will @entity1 face @entity6 as they did last year ? or will we have a home and away @entity39 tie to look forward to ? all will be revealed , i guess			1
i 'm sure you 'll agree it 's not a bad way to start a friday by finding out the line - up for this year 's semi-finals of the @entity3			1
there may be no @entity236 involvement , but do n't let that get you down			0
featured in this morning 's draw in @entity239 are four @entity76 powerhouses @entity0 , @entity6 , @entity1 and @entity9			1
the draw at @entity56 's hq in @entity242 will take place in around an hour from now , but we 'll have plenty of build - up so do n't move your mouse .			2
