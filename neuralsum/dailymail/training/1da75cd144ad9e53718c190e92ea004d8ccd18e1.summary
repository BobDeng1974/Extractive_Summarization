by @entity0 @entity1 took matters into his own hands and delivered @entity5 's team talk following a goalless 90 minutes against @entity6			1
manager @entity7 began the chat but @entity1 soon took over as his team - mates listened intently			0
and although his side could n’t muster a win in extra time , they edged out @entity6 4 - 2 on penalties to reach sunday ’s final in @entity15			1
with the score line still blank after 105 minutes , the captain seemed subdued as the @entity65 forward left the next team talk in the hands of @entity68			0
indeed , it was his @entity65 team - mate @entity16 who was the most animated player , appearing to put his hand up in his manager ’s face			1
he again stepped up to speak to his fellow players before penalties			0
@entity6 and @entity77 defender @entity76 had kept the dangerous @entity5 front line quiet as both teams battled for a place in the final against @entity82			2
@entity1 was perhaps missing the creative influence of @entity84 who missed the game through injury			0
heat map : @entity1 made his way around the park but had a relatively quiet evening follow me : @entity65 's @entity1 ( second right ) leads his players back on to the pitch for extra time two minds : @entity68 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) talk tactics before extra time during semi-final			2

@entity1 led the @entity5 team talk between full - time and **extra-time**
@entity16 took over for half - time of **extra-time**
he also led the team talk before the side stepped up for penalties
@entity5 won 4 - 2 on penalties and will play @entity82 in sunday 's final
it will be the third time that @entity82 and @entity5 face each other in a @entity26 final
