weather forecaster @entity0 this morning became a victim of @entity2 when a birch tree fell in his garden thanks to high winds			1
the veteran broadcaster is best remembered for telling @entity9 viewers in 1987 that there was not a ' hurricane ' on the way , hours before @entity6 was hit by the most destructive storm for 300 years			1
yesterday he joked that many people would believe the damage to his garden ' serves him right ' for his incorrect prediction 26 years ago			1
he told @entity34 's today programme : ' i had a phone call from my wife not so long ago , and of course it was my fault that a tree has apparently gone down in my garden and over the neighbour 's garage			0
' so even i do n't escape - and i can hear some of you saying , " serves him right ! " ' asked if predictions of the storm 's severity had proven to be exaggerated , he replied : ' no , no. it 's been a terrific storm			2
joke : the veteran broadcaster quipped that the mishap ' serves him right ' for his notorious error victim : @entity0 , pictured during a broadcast in october 1987 shortly before the @entity55 , had a tree fall in his garden this morning ' there has been massive damage and if we had n't been banging the drum for about a week or so there could have been some horrendous loss of life as well			1
' i am hoping and praying that we have virtually avoided all that			0
' praising the accuracy of modern computer modelling , he said : ' it could n't be done in my day			0
we were only able to do forecasts for one or two days ahead			0
' shortly before the @entity55 of october 16 , 1987 , mr @entity0 told viewers : ' earlier on today apparently a lady rang the @entity9 and said she heard that there was a hurricane on the way			1
then : an uprooted tree lies across a car in @entity79 after the @entity55 on october 15 , 1987 now : a car in @entity79 which was crushed by a falling tree this morning ' well , do n't worry if you 're watching , there is n't			2
' the iconic moment has achieved such notoriety that it even featured in the opening ceremony of last year 's @entity87			0
mr @entity0 has always insisted that he was not in fact talking about @entity6 - but this time around , he was taking no chances			2
the forecaster , who now broadcasts on a weather website after leaving the @entity9 , advised commuters to take the morning off work due to the difficulty of travelling .			0
