by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 03:19 est , 12 september 2012 in chilling detail , a @entity2 hiker who stumbled on the aftermath of the @entity5 massacre yesterday revealed how he was convinced one of the two girls who survived the shootings was dead			1
the 41 - year - old man said he found @entity11 , seven , lying on the ground close to where her parents and grandmother had been executed in the family 's @entity17 estate			1
@entity11 , who was shot in the shoulder and suffered a fractured skull after being pistol - whipped , was showing no signs of life			1
horrifying : @entity23 , an experienced walker who lives locally , then ran up to the car park , where the bodies of the @entity29 family were all lying dead inside their @entity17 car ' i then leaned over the little girl , ' said the local man , who identified himself as ' @entity34 '			1
' she did not reply to our calls			2
i clapped my hands , but she was not reacting			2
i even said a few words in @entity40 , as i saw the car had @entity43 licence plates , but nothing happened			0
as far as i was concerned she was dead			1
' as a @entity2 judge and prosecutor travel to @entity43 as part of their inquiries , @entity23 is the first witness to speak publicly about the brutal murders of @entity43 engineer @entity52 , 50 , his wife @entity54 , 47 , her mother @entity55 , 74 , and @entity56 , a 45 - year - old @entity2 cyclist			1
each of the murder victims were shot twice in the head last wednesday at a secluded spot on the outskirts of the village of @entity63 , close to @entity64 in eastern @entity2			1
@entity66 discovery : @entity52 , 50 , the father murdered near the village of @entity63 , near @entity64 , in the @entity69 region of @entity2 @entity23 and two women friends were driving towards the scene about 4.10pm , when a ' terrified cyclist ' came hurtling towards them			1
the cyclist was the unidentified retired @entity43 @entity74 veteran who had stumbled on the murder scene , but who had been unable to call for help			2
' this man was in a panic and coming down the road , ' said @entity23			1
' he explained to me in bad @entity2 that there was a drama a little higher up			1
' he was trying to call an ambulance			0
i did not know if he did n't have a mobile phone , or if his phone network was not connecting at this point			0
' @entity23 ran up to the car park , where the bodies of the @entity29 family were inside their car			1
' i understood what was happening straight away , ' he told @entity94 newspaper			0
' i approached the car			0
i did not touch anything , but i could see there was nothing more to be done			0
there was no sign of life			0
' there was n't a sound - it was like in a movie , one of those tv series where everything begins with a murder			2
except this time the actors were us , and we did n't have the remote control to change the channel			0
' we did not know whether we were alone or not or whether we were in danger or not - whether the people who had done this were still there or not			2
we thought we were taking risks			0
the arrival of the emergency services reassured us			0
' unbeknown to him , the @entity122 ' four - year - old daughter @entity121 was hiding under her mother 's corpse in the @entity17			1
it would be eight hours before she was discovered			0
lying motionless nearby was @entity11 , who is making a steady recovery from her injuries and is set to become the prime witness in the case			1
a few seconds after wrongly concluding she was dead , @entity23 went back down the hill to call the emergency services			1
his was the first registered call to police			0
' if we had been there a few minutes earlier it could have been us who were dead , rather than the @entity2 cyclist , ' said @entity23			1
as he went up the forest road before discovering the carnage , @entity23 said he had ' heard nothing and come across not a single person , no car , no bike '			1
this supports the theory that the gunman , or gunmen , may have been in place waiting to ambush their victims , or else had arrived by an isolated mountain path			0
@entity153 : the road leading to the spot where the shootings happened in @entity63 , part of the @entity2 @entity5 crime scene : as he went up the forest road before the drama , @entity23 said he had ' heard nothing and come across not a single person , no car , no bike ' despite being heavily sedated , @entity11 said she was ' still frightened ' by what she saw after coming out of her coma at the @entity167 hospital in @entity168 cross-channel operation : a police officer stands guard outside the property in @entity173 , @entity174 as @entity43 police and @entity2 detectives search inside investigation : police are looking at aspects of mr @entity29 's life to try to find a motive for the murders and have been speaking with his brother , @entity182 according to reports , little @entity11 will be shown photographs of the murder scene in an attempt to get her to identify the gunmen			1
