homeowners should consider fitting @entity3 to trap burglars , the country 's most senior police officer declared yesterday			1
sir @entity5 said police forces needed more crime scene footage to match against their 12million images of suspects and offenders			1
and he called on families and businesses to install cameras at eye level – to exploit advances in facial recognition technology			1
' the proposals on increasing the amount of privately owned cctv cameras are quite frankly orwellian and risk turning members of the public into an extension of the police , ' said @entity31 of @entity32			1
' @entity33 is completely unregulated			2
recommending greater use of @entity3 to gather more images of people 's faces – often innocent people 's faces – undermines the security of each and every one of us			1
' she pointed out that a @entity45 committee had on saturday released a report on the problems with facial recognition			2
@entity50 mp @entity49 said : ' we were alarmed to discover that the police have begun uploading custody photographs of people to the police national database and using facial recognition software without any regulatory oversight			1
some of the people had not even been charged			1
' sir @entity5 said most cameras were mounted high to keep them out of harm 's way and to give an overview of a crime area			1
he was speaking after @entity66 , wife of @entity69 rower @entity67 , challenged him on @entity70 on whether @entity3 could be used to catch burglars			1
her house was burgled while she and her children were sleeping and footage from a neighbour 's cctv camera was too grainy to identify the thieves			1
the @entity23 said @entity78 needed more cameras to help fight crime and urged people to think about installing them when miss @entity66 asked if more cameras were needed in homes and businesses , sir @entity5 replied : ' yes			1
we 've got a strategy to encourage people to move their cameras down to eye level			1
' facial recognition software has got better , and we can now apply it to images of burglaries , and then compare them with images we take when we arrest people			1
' what we need to be able to do is to be able to compare that photograph with the images we have of people committing a crime			1
' taking the tops of their heads is not that helpful for facial recognition which relies on the eyes and the configuration of the area around the nose and the mouth			1
so we 're trying to get people to , ideally , add a camera at face level			1
' if anyone listening has a business , think about installing a new one – they 're relatively cheap			2
if you ca n't buy one , could you think about moving it ? ' @entity121 cameras disguised as clocks , clothes hooks , mirrors and even thermometers can be bought for as little as £ 40			1
they have been responsible for an avalanche of ' @entity129 ' prosecutions involving footage taken in changing rooms , offices and toilets			2
many bookmakers use them to identify robbers or @entity139 peer @entity137 said it was wrong to encourage householders to follow suit			2
' it threatens to undermine people 's confidence and inject fear in the place where they should feel most secure , ' she said			1
' i 'm not sure it will make anyone feel any safer and the use of facial recognition technology remains largely untested and unproven			2
' research from the @entity155 last week revealed @entity3 only modestly cuts crimes such as vandalism and car theft and is useless in stopping violence			2
experts said better street lighting and neighbourhood watch schemes were more valuable			2
this is the moment that a thief was caught on camera as he came out of the wardrobe he had been hiding in for 13 hours , armed with a poker			1
@entity169 , 18 , broke into @entity171 's house in @entity172 , @entity173 , for a third time in the middle of the afternoon but was disturbed when she returned at 2.40pm			2
she saw the house had been ransacked and called police unaware that @entity169 was still in her home and when police arrived he stayed quiet in his hiding place			2
but what he did not know is that ms @entity171 had installed cctv cameras after being victim to burglaries in the past			1
armed with a poker , @entity169 , 18 , looks around one of the rooms of after hiding for 13 hours she said : ' we were all in the room while he was there - me , a police officer , another officer taking fingerprints , my partner			0
he was within arms reach of all of us			0
' there 's a shelf inside and i assume he was sitting there like a gnome holding a fishing rod			0
he 's slim but 6ft tall so i think that 's the only way he could have done it			0
' we went into the spare room with the police three times while he was sat inside there			0
i went back into the room myself later too			0
it 's very disturbing to think that someone might actually want to hit me with a poker			0
' it took me three weeks before i could even sleep at night just thinking someone could be in the house			0
' the cameras filmed him as he tried to make a getaway with a laptop and camera , brandishing a poker at 4am once his victim had gone to bed			1
in one clip that ms @entity171 released , @entity169 can be seen going into a room where he stands for a short while before turning a light on			0
he surveys the room , turns the light off and then using the glow from his mobile phone he carefully tiptoes around			0
he was arrested nearby and identified by the @entity3 footage , which showed him entering the house on one day – and then leaving it on the next			0
after his arrest police found the stolen laptop in a bag that @entity169 had with him			0
@entity169 tiptoes through the home slowly and carefully before leaving the house with a camera prosecutor @entity248 said : ' the householder returned home to find the patio doors forced and items moved within the house			0
' she reported the break - in to police			0
he hid in the wardrobe for 13 hours till 4am , then stole a camera , a laptop and a small amount of cash			0
' mr @entity248 said cctv of the break - in had shown @entity263 wearing a hood and entering the house on april 7 , and leaving it on april 8			1
they burst into the flat with knives and baseball bats and robbed the man of cash , his @entity273 laptop and his mobile phone			0
@entity169 also admitted using a bank card stolen from a woman 's handbag to draw cash from her bank account			0
in addition , he stole a man 's bank details and used them to act as a guarantor for a loan , securing £ 466 to pay for 45 mobile phone top - ups			0
@entity286 , for @entity263 , said his client showed ' contrition and remorse ' and had made ' full and frank ' admissions			0
he said : ' this is terribly sad			0
he has been in care as a child , been fostered by people who were kind to him and now shows contrition and remorse			2
his ambition is to join the @entity297			0
' @entity169 was sentenced to five years in a young offenders ' institution , less 57 days spent on remand			0
judge @entity301 told @entity263 : ' it is unclear what underpinned this sudden spate of serious offending			0

@entity5 said people installed their cctv cameras too high
this meant only the tops of the *criminals* ' heads were caught on film
families should install their own cameras to help catch burglars , he said
the @entity322 chief said @entity78 needed more cameras to help fight crime
