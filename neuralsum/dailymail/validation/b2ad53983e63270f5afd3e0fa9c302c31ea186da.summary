they may look like they are from different families , but believe it or not @entity4 and @entity5 are actually twins			1
the adorable 11 - year - old boys , who hail from @entity8 in @entity9 , were born with contrasting skin tones - @entity4 has a dark complexion and @entity5 is white			1
and as if questions over the colour of their skin was n't enough for the young fellas , they also have the added complication of having different birthdays - with @entity4 being born on november 6 and @entity5 coming into the world after midnight , making his birthday november 7			1
their mother , @entity30 , 32			2
brings the dark skin to the family , which she inherited from her grandmother , who is @entity36			1
their father is the complete opposite - @entity39 , 36 , has a white complexion and fair hair			1
when the pair found out they were expecting twins , they wondered how their children would look , but could never could have dreamed of the conclusion			0
' we were surprised for sure - the running joke is because they were made in the @entity52 that @entity30 had the local @entity54 milkman stop by one day when i was at work to make the brown one , ' their dad @entity39 told @entity58			0
' but we do n't really see it as a huge deal they just look different like any siblings can			0
' their parents joke that because the boys were conceived in the @entity52 the local milkman dropped by to make the ' brown one ' @entity5 ( left ) is carefree and @entity4 ( right ) is responsible and as the oldest of the two is a born leader now the boys have just started a new school , @entity71 , and are tasked with the unenviable challenge of trying to explain to their peers that they are related			1
' they do get a lot of people believing they are not twins especially school kids , ' he said			1
' we make sure they are in different classes at school too because @entity4 is the stronger one and @entity5 will just sit back and ride on the coat tails of @entity4 - so we have had to pull him out of the clouds			1
' the odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one			0
skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together			0
if a parent is of mixed race , their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin			2
however , if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes , the baby will be white			0
and if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin , the baby will be black			0
but the boys embrace the attention they get for looking so different			0
' they think it 's perfect - they think it 's great because they are twins but they are individual and celebrate different birthdays , ' their proud dad said sometimes @entity5 gets jealous of his brother 's bronze skin			1
' we went out fishing in the boat the other day and @entity5 and i had to put sunscreen on while @entity4 just lay there with his shirt off getting tanned without any sunblock , ' he said			2
according to their father , the boys have contrasting personalties but do have a strong twin bond			0
' they are best friends and always will be , ' he said			0
' @entity5 has a very dry sense of humour whereas @entity4 is more outgoing and takes the lead as the older boy , ' he said			2
' whenever i 'm away for work he will always be responsible and make sure the house is locked up whereas @entity5 is carefree and relaxed			2
' @entity5 ( left ) gets jealous of his brother 's bronze skin because he does n't have to wear sunscreen - pictured with their mum @entity30 and her father @entity137 the boys are in different classes so @entity5 ( right ) does n't ride on the coat tails of his older brother by a day @entity142 and @entity143 , 18 , from @entity144 are non-identical twins their story comes after a pair of 18 - year - old girls , from @entity144 , who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed - race parentage , revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers			1
@entity142 and @entity143 , who looks completely different told @entity155 's @entity154 that their classmates did not believe them when they told them they were twins			0
their mother @entity157 is half @entity158 and their father @entity159 is white , and in a genetic quirk , together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin .			2

11 - year - old @entity4 and @entity5 are twins with different looks
@entity4 has dark skin while @entity5 was born with a white complexion
they also have different birthdays , with @entity4 being born after midnight
their mother is half @entity36 and their father has @entity178 heritage
