the @entity0 , which struck the @entity1 a quarter of a billion years ago , claimed more lives than any other mass extinction in the planet 's history			1
the most popular theory for its cause is volcanic eruptions that led to immense amounts of basalt lava spreading across @entity11 over a period of 600,000 years			1
now , evidence of vinegar - like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in these eruption has been found by researchers scouring 250 million - year - old rocks in @entity19			1
in an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long , the researchers turned to the dairy industry , which sometimes uses vanilla in milk.acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low ph deactivates the enzymes that would break it down			1
the same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock ' for the first time , we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar , ' @entity33 , a geologist at @entity34 told @entity42			1
the rocks in @entity19 's @entity44 contained vanillin – the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour			1
the discovery was a surprise , as vanillin is usually broken down by bacteria			1
in an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long , the researchers turned to the dairy industry , which sometimes uses vanilla in milk			1
the rocks provide further evidence to suggest the @entity0 was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed out of sulphur dioxide that in turn caused acidic rain acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low ph deactivates the enzymes that would break it down			1
the same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock			2
a huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction , based on the examination of grains of ' shocked quartz ' and meteorite fragments in @entity80 , but no impact site has been found			0
one of the attractions of the theory is that it could trigger other causes such as the @entity87 eruptions			2
widespread ocean anoxia ( a severe deficiency of oxygen ) has also been blamed for the event in the @entity92 to the @entity93			0
the spread of toxic , oxygen - depleted water would have been devastating for marine life , producing widespread die - offs			0
models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia ( the presence of hydrogen sulphide ) would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide , which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism			2
' our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning , ' says @entity114 , a paleoecologist at @entity115 in the @entity116			0
the findings follow a similar study in 2013 by @entity120 scientists who simulated the @entity0			1
the @entity122 researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain , which could have affected plant growth			1
they believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth , contributing to their ultimate extinction			2
' imagine you 're a plant that 's growing happily in the latest @entity92 , ' said @entity134 , a postdoctoral researcher in @entity122 's @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			2
' it 's been getting hotter and hotter , but perhaps your species has had time to adjust to that			1
but then quite suddenly , over the course of a few months , the rain begins to sizzle with sulphuric acid			0
it would be quite a shock if you were that plant , ' he said			0
after the eruptions ended , the researchers found believe @entity151 levels in rain bounced back , becoming less acidic within one year			2
the rocks in @entity19 's @entity44 contained vanillin – the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour			1
the discovery was a surprise , as vanillin is usually broken down by bacteria meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on @entity1 @entity168 - @entity167 mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in @entity1 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years			1
around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 - 88 per cent of all species			0
late @entity177 mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on @entity1 died out in the @entity180 , though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years			0
around 22 per cent of all marine families , and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 - 87 per cent of all species			0
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the @entity92 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity0 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			2
all life on @entity1 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
@entity193 - @entity192 mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the @entity193 - @entity192 mass extinction event			0
22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76 - 84 per cent of all species			0
@entity202 - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the @entity204 mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs			0
however , many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71 - 81 per cent of all species .			0

geologists made the discovery after studying rocks in @entity19 's @entity44
they contained vanillin , which can only survive in acidic *conditions*
' for the first time , we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar , ' said @entity33 , one of the lead geologists
the rocks provide further evidence to suggest the @entity0 was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed out of sulphur dioxide
