sir @entity25 , founder of the @entity96 and president of @entity2 said : ' @entity7 is a @entity99 business giving a better deal to @entity99 passengers			2

' we are doing so with a full service , a great schedule and at exceptionally good value for money			0
' there have been challenges as there would be for any new business , but we do not shy away from these – in fact they are what the @entity2 entrepreneurial spirit is all about			0
