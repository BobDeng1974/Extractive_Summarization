the sun was shining as i enjoyed a latte at a pavement cafe recently when i started frantically rummaging in my handbag			1
watching my anxiety , my colleagues assumed i had mislaid my @entity7 or my wallet			2
but no , this was far more serious			2
' i need my sunscreen , ' i explained , trying to keep the note of panic out of my voice			2
i could see by the stunned look on their faces that they found it hard to take me seriously			0
i ca n't really blame them			0
after all , tans never really went out of fashion , despite the health warnings			0
to most , a tan means confidence and self - esteem			1
the usual reaction from friends and colleagues when one appears , bronzed after a foreign holiday , is to comment on ' how well ' you look			0
but - as i have discovered - there is no such thing as a healthy tan			1
and i have the scar on my face to prove it			1
earlier this year , i was treated for basal cell carcinoma			0
it left me with a gaping hole on the side of my nose , which had to be reconstructed with plastic surgery , and there is a possibility the cancer may return			1
basal cell carcinoma is the cancer actor @entity60 was diagnosed with			1
left untreated , it would have eaten away and damaged surrounding tissue			1
so , forgive me if i sound fanatical			0
my factor 50 sunscreen is just about the most important thing in my bag			1
i carry it everywhere and apply it religiously at least twice a day - more if i am sitting directly in the sun. i have no doubt that , if i can get cancer , any woman can			1
i 'm 34 and i did n't go abroad until i was 18			1
growing up in a working - class family in @entity75 , foreign holidays were beyond us			1
the only sunshine i encountered as a child was in @entity79 , and i never wore sunscreen			1
@entity32 pictured before the incident my brush with cancer did not start with a mole - as most people imagine - but with an innocent - looking pimple			1
i first noticed it on the right side of my nose in spring last year			1
i have n't had spots since i was a teenager			0
irritated , i blamed my moisturiser and swapped to another brand			0
when it still did n't clear up , i decided my diet was to blame and tried to improve it			0
the pimple disappeared for a few weeks but then it came back			0
in desperation i invested in an expensive anti-spot cream			0
but still it came and went			0
sometimes it was raised , sometimes it was just a red mark			0
i know now that this changeability is a classic sign of cancer			1
the surgeon had to take skin from the cheek to fill in the hole where the cancer and surrounding tissue was i 'd associated skin cancer purely with moles - i have a few and keep a close eye on them			1
and , as i later discovered , the medics i consulted were just as ignorant			0
when i finally went to an @entity118 walk - in centre near my home in @entity120 , five months after i 'd first noticed the spot , my major concern was my appearance			1
i was embarrassed about being so vain.after all , who gets medical help for a spot on her nose ? the nurse who examined me did n't take it seriously either			1
telling me not to worry , she prescribed antibiotics to clear up the ' infection '			0
so when the spot still did n't clear , it never occurred to me to return			1
i did n't realise that the cancer was burrowing its way into my skin			1
the longer it was left , the more damage it was doing			1
i was lulled into such a false sense of security , the cancer would probably still be growing today if i had n't bumped into a dermatologist at a @entity144 last december			1
@entity145 are the most common form of skin cancer in the @entity40 @entity149 cell carcinomas are the most common form of skin cancer in the @entity40 , with more than 200,000 cases diagnosed every year			1
they normally look like an open sore , or a red irritated patch , and occur in the top layer of the skin ( left )			1
@entity156 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity157 , says : ' i see patients who have never been abroad - the @entity40 sun is strong enough to cause basal cell carcinoma			1
' basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads , unlike malignant melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer that kills 2,000 @entity40 each year			1
however , it can cause disfigurement			0
looking at me , he could n't hide his concern			0
' you really ought to have that spot looked at , ' he said			0
' it 's driving me nuts but i 've been told not to worry about it , ' i explained			0
but he was so insistent that i booked an appointment with my gp			0
just like at the drop - in centre , she looked at the spot , which by now had a waxy appearance , and told me not to fret			2
even when i explained that the spot changed appearance regularly , she treated me like a hypochondriac			0
but this time i insisted she refer me to my local hospital , @entity186 's in @entity120			0
two weeks later , i went for a skin biopsy			2
under local anaesthetic , a tiny sliver of skin was removed from the spot			2
the whole procedure took just ten minutes			0
as i posed for photos that @entity144 with a plaster on my nose , i hoped i had seen the end of the spot and any worry about it			2
you can imagine my terror when i received a letter a week after @entity144 telling me that i had cancer			2
it was the first time anyone had used the word			0
i was so shocked , i started crying and shaking			0
i was booked in to have the tumour removed two weeks later			0
over the phone , a nurse at the clinic explained the procedure and tried to calm my fears			0
basal cell carcinoma spreads in fewer than 0.5 per cent of cases , and treatment is successful 90 per cent of the time			0
the cause ? @entity218 exposure			0
i went on my first sunshine holiday to @entity220 when i was 18 and since then have been abroad frequently			1
i never burned badly , but my goal was always a tan			1
but it never occurred to me to use suntan lotion in @entity40			1
@entity32 , pictured after surgery , did n't burn badly on holiday but it never occurred to her to use lotion in @entity40 i could n't rest until the cancer was out			1
the operation itself was straightforward			2
under local anaesthetic , the surgeon removed the spot and surrounding tissue			2
the sample was then @entity237 was really lucky - all the cancer was gone			1
but when the nurse took the dressing off , i burst into tears			0
i had a centimetre - deep crater on my nose			1
the surgeon had to take skin from my cheek to fill in the hole			1
she promised it would heal and there would barely be a scar			2
but , as i left hospital , dosed up on painkillers , i felt like @entity252			2
and when the stitches came out two weeks later , all i could see was a vicious red scar			2
the first time i went out socially , i spent ages putting on heavy concealer			0
that 's when it hit me that there was no miracle cure			0
i sat on the floor of the bathroom and sobbed : ' what have they done to my face ? ' but it was a release			0
i had to count my blessings			0
if i had n't insisted on a biopsy , the cancer would still be growing - eating away at my entire face			1
as the months have passed , the scar has healed			2
i return for check - ups every 12 weeks and am rigorous about checking for new marks			2
my attitude to the sun has changed completely			0
i slather myself with factor 50 every morning - reducing to factor 30 in the winter			1
i 've persuaded my friends to do the same - looking at my face , they did n't take much convincing			2
but i am horrified to see young women dashing into the sun at the first opportunity			0
i came so close to destroying my looks for ever - and all because i wanted a tan			2

tv star @entity291 , 34 , from @entity75 , had cancer on her nose
she enjoyed sunshine holidays from the age of 18 but never burned badly
it never occurred to her to use suntan lotion in @entity40
after an operation she was left with a centimetre - deep crater on her nose
the surgeon had to take skin from her cheek to fill it in
her scar is faint now but she wears factor 50 - even in the @entity40
