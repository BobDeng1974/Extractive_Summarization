by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 @entity1 knew the old @entity3 chapel near @entity4 in @entity5 was the home for him as soon as he walked through the door : he is 6ft 6in tall and it was a huge relief to have room above his head for once			1
the spacious interior , large windows bringing in masses of light and the potential to create a unique home big enough for a family sold the @entity19 chapel to both @entity1 and his wife @entity20 when they first saw it in 2004			1
it had already been converted into a house , but the @entity23 had their own ideas			1
seeing the light : @entity20 and baby @entity25 sit in the suspended bubble chair above the glass floor - beneath them are @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity30 in the hallway while it remains virtually the same from the outside as when it was built in 1869 , @entity1 , 45 , and @entity20 , 38 , have transformed the chapel ’s interior into a fantastic contemporary family home , with shiny red kitchen , glass floor and brightly coloured windows			1
it ’s an upside - down house , with the bedrooms – seven of them – on the ground and lower - ground floors , while the first floor , once a smaller mezzanine , is now a stunning open - plan living space with high ceilings , original timber floors and windows on all four sides flooding the area with light all day			1
as you come through the wide glass and wood front door into the hall , a strikingly impressive staircase leads you up to the first floor			2
the staircase was made locally , to @entity1 ’s own design , from oak and steel with clear glass balustrades			2
although he has no training as a designer , @entity1 , who used to be a management consultant and now runs a group of @entity72 sandwich shop franchises , is fascinated by design and is not short on ideas			2
he did the drawings using @entity76 , adjusting the dimensions so that even the oak handrail was the right fit for his larger - than - normal grip			1
half - a - million home : the old @entity3 chapel near @entity4 in @entity5 , built in 1869 , boasts seven bedrooms and is on the market for £ 495,000 open plan : the stairs , designed by @entity1 , which leads up to the lounge and kitchen at the top of the stairs , the 38ft by 28ft living space certainly has the wow factor			1
there are more than ten windows , including a deep porthole in the kitchen area and three dramatic arched windows at the staircase end			2
two of these have been covered with different , brightly coloured film , creating rainbow patterns when the sun is at a certain angle			2
it was @entity1 who painstakingly applied the coloured film			2
in front of the coloured windows , the old mezzanine floor was extended to fill the space above the hall with thick glass – a clever way of maximising the floor space upstairs without having to lose the sense of height and space as you come into the chapel			1
above the glass floor is a bubble swing chair suspended from the ceiling – the perfect place to curl up and read a book , says @entity20			0
‘ we did n’t know what to do with that space at first , ’ she says			0
‘ then i thought of the bubble chair			0
now it ’s my favourite spot in the house			1
’ what helps give the chapel interior its contemporary edge is the stylish and original lighting			1
above the stairwell hangs a spectacular bespoke light fitting made up of a series of different sized spheres in vibrant colours , reflecting the colours in the arched windows			0
‘ it looks great at night , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ people stop us in the street and say how much they love looking up at our balloon lights			0
’ modern eating : the kitchen in the seven - bedroom home , transformed from late 19th century chapel to family residence comfortable leather sofas , bright rugs and a contemporary log burner set into the wall create a stylish sitting area , while bronze - coloured glass blocks separate the kitchen without dividing up the room			1
the hob is inset into the large granite island so that the cook can socialise with whoever else is in the room , with the bright red bar stools a magnet for guests , says @entity1			0
where the altar used to be on the ground floor is now the couple ’s bedroom			1
there are four more bedrooms on this floor , two of which are used by children @entity29 , six , and @entity30 , five – with a third ready for baby @entity25 who ’s just a few months old			0
the fourth is used as a playroom			0
@entity1 and @entity20 have an en suite and there ’s also a luxurious marble family bathroom with walk - in power shower , a super-sized bath and a sink set in granite			1
the lower ground floor is where @entity1 has his office			0
@entity20 , an ex-teacher , helps him run the business			0
there are two more bedrooms for guests , another bathroom , @entity1 ’s gym and a garage			0
while there is no shortage of bedrooms , some of them are quite small and the @entity23 are now thinking forward to when their children are older , and have put the chapel on the market at £ 495,000			1
‘ their bedrooms are fine for them now but they ’ll need bigger ones when they ’re teenagers , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ we will miss the chapel terribly , though – we ’ve put so much of ourselves into it			2
