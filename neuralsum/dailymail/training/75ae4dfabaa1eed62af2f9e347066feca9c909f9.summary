by @entity0 for many long - haul travellers , it is the nightmare scenario			1
you are just settling down for a nap or to read when a young child in the row behind starts screaming or kicking the seat , and does n’t stop			0
now a budget airline has come up with a solution for passengers who find their journey spoilt by crying babies and toddlers ’ tantrums – by introducing child - free zones			1
adults only : the airline has promised soft light and no disruptions in their @entity19 , that only allows 12 - year - olds and over to sit there ( file picture ) but selecting a seat in the ‘ quiet zone ’ , which will also have softer lighting , costs up to £ 22 extra			1
the idea , which is likely to anger parents as well as appeal to child - free travellers , is being marketed by @entity31 ’s no - frills long - haul carrier @entity31 the first seven rows in the economy cabin are off - limits to children under 12 on flights from @entity38 in @entity39 to @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and some other destinations			1
the airline , which uses the slogan ‘ now everyone can fly ’ , said the section on its fleet of @entity49 , which is separated from the rest of economy by a set of toilets and a curtain , now offers a ‘ more relaxing cabin atmosphere ’			0
passengers booking in this section must pay between £ 8 and £ 22 extra			1
the airline is owned by @entity39 entrepreneur @entity58 , the owner and chairman of @entity61 football club @entity60 , who since buying @entity31 in 2001 has transformed it from a loss - making business into @entity65 ’s largest budget airline			1
promise of peace : the seats , highlighted in blue , promise to be free from children @entity71 launched the seats last week on flights from @entity38 to @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 chief executive @entity73 said the idea ‘ allows our guests to have a more pleasant and peaceful journey with minimal noise and less disturbance			0
’ he added : ‘ the airline is not banning kids from travelling , but instead , is enhancing the array of product offerings on board to suit its guests ’ individual needs and preferences			0
’ there are no immediate signs of @entity91 airlines bringing in a similar system , however			0
@entity93 said : ‘ we do n’t have any plans for anything like this			0
' we have just changed over to a system of fully - allocated seating so customers can choose where they want to sit and do n’t plan any more changes			2
’ @entity103 said : ‘ we welcome families in all our cabins and have no plans to offer child - free zones			2
’ @entity108 also said it had ‘ no plans ’ to follow @entity71 ’s lead			0
a poll by the @entity113 website last year found that over a third of @entity91 would be prepared to pay extra for their flights if they did not have to sit near children			2
another survey found 53 per cent supported child - free flights			0
last year @entity119 created a child - free zone on the upper deck of the new @entity122 on some of its long - haul flights .			1

passengers will pay between £ 8 and £ 22 for ' @entity19 '
it is being marketed by @entity31 *'s* no - frills long - haul carrier @entity31
