@entity1 @entity0 served a first - half double for non-league @entity3 but their @entity4 of cheer ran dry as @entity7 ’s @entity6 called time on their remarkable run			1
the 30 - year - old @entity3 skipper will be opening up @entity10 in @entity11 on sunday morning as he returns to the day job he chose over a career as a professional footballer			1
on this evidence , @entity0 would not be out of place in the @entity17			2
there were certainly no half measures during a pulsating opening period in which @entity3 – of the seventh - tier @entity21 and playing their seventh match in this season ’s competition – took a deserved two - goal lead thanks to the devastating @entity0 in front of a sold out @entity27			1
@entity3 players celebrate taking the lead against @entity7 as they looked to cause another @entity4 upset @entity31 went so close yet so far as they took a two - goal lead before relinquishing it against their @entity17 visitors @entity0 salutes the @entity3 fans after he got the side on their way to a giant killing , before @entity7 hit back @entity6 celebrates as @entity3 lost their two - goal cushion and @entity7 went 3 - 2 up on saturday in the @entity4 @entity6 celebrates as @entity7 came back from two goals down to win 3 - 2 against @entity41 club @entity3 @entity0 applauds fans after @entity31 were knocked out of the @entity4 despite their courageous effort against @entity7 @entity3 players look gutted after letting their two - goal lead slip in the @entity4 to eventually fall against @entity17 opposition @entity31 did themselves proud against @entity7 but ultimately could not get beyond the @entity4 third round @entity3 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity49 6 ; @entity50 6 ( @entity51 90 ) , @entity52 6 ( @entity53 86 ) , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 ; @entity56 7 ; rivers 7.5 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 66 , 6 ) , @entity60 6 , @entity0 8 ; @entity61 7 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 scorers : @entity68 , 41 bookings : @entity0 @entity7 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity70 6 ; @entity71 6 , @entity72 6.5 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 6 ; @entity75 7.5 , @entity76 5.5 , @entity77 6 , @entity78 6.5 ( @entity79 82 ) ; @entity80 5.5 ; @entity81 subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 scorers : @entity75 52 , @entity6 55 , 58 bookings : @entity78 , @entity74 referee : @entity92 5 man of the match : @entity0 the hosts emerged for the second half under instruction to ‘ keep it tight for 15 minutes ’			1
by the hour mark , however , they were trailing , such was the madness of this enthralling tie played on a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses at			0
it was , despite the narrow nature of the defeat for the underdogs , a magical afternoon			0
@entity3 boss @entity65 was certainly proud of his side ’s mammoth effort			2
‘ if you ’d said before the game we ’d get beaten 3 - 2 you might have taken that , ’ he said			1
‘ i think we deserved to win it but they had 10 minutes of total dominance which killed it			0
‘ so i ’m very proud of what they have done			0
this team has got a lot to give and the future is very bright			0
’ @entity0 , too , refused to bemoan the turnaround			2
‘ you get to 2 - 0 at half - time and you think the shock is on , ’ he said			1
‘ the instruction at half - time was “ keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes ” but that didn ’ t work out did it ? ! ‘ it was uphill after that really but in the last 20 minutes we came again			1
i had a half chance which went just wide and @entity139 ( @entity53 ) had a header which went into the side - netting			2
we might have nicked a replay			0
’ @entity31 took the lead on 35 minutes when @entity144 , scorer of the stoppage - time winner at @entity146 in the second round , drove into the area			1
he outwitted himself and two defenders with a clumsy step - over attempt and took advantage to draw back for @entity0 who steamed in to smash home			1
@entity0 , receiving a short free - kick from @entity56 , drifted , as he does , languidly into the area			1
but beneath his lethargy resides a lethal streak and the winger duly dropped a shoulder before locating the bottom corner			0
and @entity0 , reflecting on his brace , said : ‘ for the first one @entity162 did brilliantly to battle his way out of the corner and pull it back and the defender got his studs caught in the turf and i just ran on to it			1
@entity169 scores his side 's first goal after the 35th minute to take a surprise lead against @entity7 @entity0 runs away in celebration after putting his team 1 - 0 up before going on to double the lead in the 41st minute @entity31 celebrate after taking a 2 - 0 lead against @entity7 on saturday as they looked to cause an upset ‘ then , for the second one , we ’ve tried that a couple of times when @entity56 does n’t fancy crossing it and we work it short			1
i just had a run and the lad let me get inside			0
the shot was on and i took it			0
‘ it was incredible , the ground was bouncing and i was thinking , “ i could get three here ”			0
it was n’t to be and they had a brilliant 10 minutes , but we can be proud of what we have done as a team			0
it ’s been a brilliant run and we ’ve been close to going out a few times			0
‘ it ’s back to reality now , @entity199 away on tuesday night			2
first i ’m opening up the pub in the morning but i ’ll be out with my mates for a few beers tonight			0
’ the turning point in the contest perhaps arrived in first - half injurytime when @entity31 ’s livewire forward @entity61 escaped in the area and took aim for the top corner only for @entity70 to extend an arm and flip over			1
without that stop @entity7 ’s confidence would have been irreversibly sapped			2
as it was , they emerged for the second half determined to make amends for the embarrassment of the first			2
what followed was three goals in six minutes			0
@entity6 scores as @entity7 bounce back from being two goals down against @entity3 on saturday @entity6 runs away in celebration as @entity31 let their two - goal lead slip in six minutes in the second half @entity7 players celebrate as they took a 3 - 2 lead through @entity6 ( left ) against non-league outfit @entity3 first it was @entity75 who smashed into the bottom corner from the edge of the area on 52 minutes before @entity6 out - muscled centre back @entity52 and hammered beyond @entity49			1
and @entity6 capped the quick - fire turnaround when @entity78 swept over from the left and he rose to head in from six yards			1
and @entity7 boss @entity233 , who made 10 changes for the game , said : ‘ we learnt a bit more than we wanted to learn about some of the players at half - time			1
‘ i felt it was very important we scored early in the second half and we knew that would unsettle them a little bit			2
i ’m very pleased with the response , we showed a lot of character			0
‘ i just thought it was a brilliant afternoon			0
i might not stay up and watch it on @entity250 later - i do n’t think i can put myself through it again ! but that ’s what the cup is about			2
i played in the @entity256 side that lost to @entity257 , and a guy , @entity258 , signed from @entity259 , scored the winner			0
and that was a @entity262 side knocking a @entity21 side out			0
‘ so we have seen how it works and we would n’t have complained if we had got beat , but i am very , very pleased we are in the next round			0
’ as for @entity0 , they ’ll still be toasting a drink to the @entity3 hero for years to come			1
