by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 06:37 est , 3 october 2012 her infamous portrayal of a cool , no - nonsense assassin with no reason left to live but revenge earned @entity6 an @entity7 for @entity8			1
now the role earns her another accolade , however dubious , as she tops @entity12 's list of cinema 's most lethal ladies			1
@entity6 's quirkiness and calm brutality makes her one of @entity18 's most unforgettable characters			1
his only choice , when @entity6 became pregnant @entity18 refused to recast her and paused production			1
and she leaves no stone unturned , slaughtering 72			0
with a total of 50 killings , @entity39 , another of @entity18 's heroines played by @entity42 , gets the number two spot			1
you can imagine the go - go dancer is n't too happy after several zombies tear off her right leg			2
through the film she fights her way out of a hospital populated by zombies and attacks a rapist by snapping off her makeshift leg across his face and jabbing the remainder into his eye			0
the real action begins when @entity60 's broken wooden leg is replaced with a modified @entity61 with a @entity63 grenade launcher attachment , upon when she kills the rapist and many other zombies with it			2
other contenders include 11 - year - old vigilante @entity69 played by @entity70 , the youngest by far , a self - styled superhero trained by her father			1
when drug dealers and thugs threaten her frenemy and fellow costumed vigilante @entity74 she steps in to rescue him			0
throughout the story our heroes run into conflict with the thugs many times until finally @entity69 storms their headquarters , killing them all and taking her to third place in the list			1
@entity42 plays go - go dancer @entity39 in @entity18 's 2007 film @entity89 / @entity39 while @entity70 plays the role of self - styled vigilante @entity69 in @entity93 's 2010 film @entity95 stars as @entity98 spy @entity96 accused of being a @entity100 agent in action thriller @entity96 former assassin @entity102 ( @entity103 ) overcomes amnesia in action thriller @entity101 to rediscover her expert @entity106 skills , racking up 32 victims in the process , a figure which guarantees her fourth place in the list			1
the fascination with vengeful female protagonists in strong lead roles - the new femme fatales - is on the increase in popular culture , neo-noir crime thrillers and graphic novels			2
the modern - day cinematic leading ladies are a new slick and deadly breed , rather than the helpless , child - like , waiting to be rescued roles of the past			2
