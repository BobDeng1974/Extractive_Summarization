by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 18 july 2013 for his role as @entity7 troubleshooter @entity5 in blockbuster zombie disaster move @entity5 , @entity8 , one of the most sought - after stars in @entity2 , took home a cool £ 9million			1
but a @entity12 lawyer who also played @entity5 - as the actor 's body double - took home a slightly more meagre fee - £ 4.44 an hour			1
@entity16 , 26 , an @entity17 - based solicitor from @entity18 in @entity17 , started filming at 6am and had to be on set for 18 gruelling hours of filming in @entity20			1
he was told not to speak to mr @entity8 , engaged to fellow superstar @entity21 , and took home a modest £ 80 for his efforts			1
disparity : @entity16 , the body double for @entity8 in @entity5 , earned just £ 4.44 an hour			1
by contrast , the superstar actor earned £ 9million for his role as a @entity7 worker trying to survive an undead outbreak yet car - lover mr @entity16 , whose job takes him the length and breadth of @entity12 , was glad to be involved in such an epic movie , which cost an estimated £ 250million to make , and said he did n't do it for the money			1
he said : ' i basically had to be @entity8 for the day and copy everything he did on screen			0
' @entity8 was there the entire time , and they were filming over the course of months , so it must have been quite tough			2
' despite his role in the film , which is tipped to have a sequel filmed next year , he told the @entity49 he has n't yet found the time to watch it			2
he also was n't invited to the @entity51 premiere and did n't even get an autograph			0
apocalyptic : actor @entity8 earned £ 9million for his role in zombie movie @entity5 , much of which was filmed in @entity20 @entity8 , as a @entity7 operative , is forced to battled the undead in the film , which is tipped for a sequel yet he still relished the experience			1
many of his scenes with mr @entity8 were filmed in a supermarket in @entity20			2
he followed the actor around , mirroring his actions as he ran through the shop desperately salvaging food as apocalyptic events rage outside			0
amazingly mr @entity16 made the spur - of - the - moment decision to try out as an extra during a shopping trip in @entity20 and did n't expect anything to come of it			1
he told the @entity73 : ' i was actually in court when i got the message			0
' i had to ask my boss if i could go but they were very supportive			0
' ' i needed to appear like i was n’t starstruck — but i was			0
' mr @entity16 was selected because his physique is similar to the @entity2 sex symbol and had to wear identical clothes for the shoot			2
he added : ' i had the same physique as him – we were both slim - built – though not any more , as i ’ve put on weight since then			0
@entity8 ’s a very professional guy and i had a job to do and i just did it to the best of my ability			0

@entity16 earned just £ 80 for 18 arduous hours of filming
he stood in for £ 9million - a - film superstar during scenes for @entity5
yet he says he was just happy to be involved in £ 250million *thriller*
the lawyer applied to be an extra on a whim as he was out shopping
