snap : a palaeontologist has identified the oldest prehistoric crocodile of its kind in the world after finding the fossil of a @entity9 at @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12 mr @entity14 , of @entity23 in @entity11 , identified the reptile from its long snout which is more than 2ft long and 7in wide , reported @entity26			1
it was discovered by @entity11 amateur fossil enthusiast @entity28 , who found the heavy pieces of the snout and a vertebrate in 2005 while fossil hunting , and donated them to the university			1
mr @entity28 had originally thought the pieces were petrified wood			2
‘ this piece looked like a loaf of bread from @entity40 , ’ he said			0
‘ it was all wrinkled			0
then i picked it up and turned it over and saw it had big round conical teeth			0
i thought : “ this is amazing			0
” ’ big guy : the @entity49 is a cousin of the modern - day @entity52 gharial , pictured , but was much larger - and it is a distant cousin of modern - day crocodiles and alligators find : @entity14 , of @entity23 in @entity11 , has changed what we know about the species originally thought to have originated in @entity18 , because it now appears it was a native of @entity12 the discovery of the 96 - million - year - old reptile ’s fossil suggested that its head would have been about one metre long , mr @entity14 said			1
the @entity49 is a cousin of the modern - day @entity52 gharial but was much larger - and it is a distant cousin of modern - day crocodiles and alligators , reported @entity23			0
mr @entity14 revealed the find ‘ changes a lot about what we thought we knew about this group ’			1
‘ now we know the group had a wider distribution range , and that it 's much older , ’ he said			0
‘ it represents a unique find for @entity12			2
this is the first occurrence of @entity78 in @entity12			2
‘ it 's also the oldest occurrence of @entity9 in the world and it 's also the southernmost occurrence of @entity9 anywhere			0
’ scan : the discovery of the 96 - million - year - old reptile 's fossil suggested that its head would have been about one metre long located : the fossil was discovered by @entity11 amateur fossil enthusiast @entity28 , who found the heavy pieces of the snout and a vertebrate in 2005 there are six other known @entity78 fossil specimens - five from @entity94 and one from @entity18 - and the @entity18 specimen from @entity97 was thought to be the oldest			1
scientists had originally believed the prehistoric crocodiles originated in @entity18 and then migrated across the @entity100 before dispersing throughout the @entity94 region			1
‘ now we know @entity9 most likely originated here in @entity12 and dispersed northward , ’ he said			1
‘ based on @entity105 and the @entity52 gharial , which are both large crocodiles , a regression analysis indicates this @entity9 probably would have been 23 to 25ft long			0
’ this is in contrast to today ’s largest living crocodile - the saltwater - which can get up to 20ft long			0
today there are only 23 species of living crocodiles , but in prehistoric times there were hundreds , reported @entity23 .			2
