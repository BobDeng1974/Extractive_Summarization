@entity60 , defending , said : ‘ this was a man who acted rather hastily			0
it is , you might think , absurd somebody is getting married on the same day they are handed a divorce certificate			2

judge @entity89 said he had ‘ considerable sympathy ’ for @entity91 , adding : ‘ i can well understand her being extremely upset by the thought that you ’d married again without the courtesy of going through a divorce with her			2
’ but outside the court , miss @entity6 said of @entity8 : ‘ i feel as though he has got away with this and has been portrayed as some kind of victim himself after all that he has put me through			1
‘ he knew if he responded to my divorce petition , he ’d give away where he ’d been hiding			0
