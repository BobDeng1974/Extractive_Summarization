by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 5 october 2012 it appears that the existence of global warming , once such a hotly contested issue is now widely accepted , but the extent to which mankind is behind the changes still divides opinion			1
a recent online poll found the percentage of people who believe global warming is happening is consistently high across the world , but belief that man is to blame is much lower , with the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 being the most sceptical			1
of the 13,500 people surveyed from 13 countries the majority agree global warming is happening , basing this opinion on increased or excessive rainfall , rising average temperatures and droughts			1
dire consequences : scientists have warned that the loss of glaciers in @entity29 , which are now in terminal decline because of global warming , will threaten the water supplies of millions of people flash floods in @entity34 : the majority of people now agree in the existence of global warming , often based on climate changes they see around them such as increased rainfall there was still some discrepancy across countries , with 98 per cent of those surveyed in @entity44 and @entity45 believing in climate change , compared to 72 per cent in the @entity15			1
however there was far more of a divide between nations when it came to belief in the reason behind global warming			0
global warming , or the rise of the earth 's atmosphere is believed in large part to be due to an increase of greenhouse gases , produced by industry emissions , the burning of fossil fuels and large scale farming , becoming trapped in the atmosphere			0
the rate of increase is rising , with two thirds of the recorded 0.8 ° c rise early 20th century having occurred since 1980			0
devastation : nearly 30,000 people were killed in @entity70 when a tsunami hit in 2005			0
developing nations are more likely to agree human behaviour is a cause of global warming in response to the question of whether human activity was mainly responsible for climate change the @entity15 @entity16 and @entity17 all revealed a fairly high level of skepticism			1
in the @entity15 58 per cent agreed human activity was a contributing factor while in @entity16 it was 65 per cent and 78 per cent in @entity17			0
these scores were markedly lower than other nations			0
in @entity44 94 percent of citizens agreed , followed by 93 percent in @entity87 , 92 percent in @entity45 and 87 percent in @entity88			2
the poll was conducted for the insurance firm @entity90 by opinion poll group @entity91 and questioned people in @entity93 , @entity16 , @entity94 , @entity88 , @entity44 , @entity87 , @entity95 , @entity17 , @entity45 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity15			1
debate : the causes of global warming will continue to be a hotly disputed issue , while the real time consequences can increasingly be seen across the globe such as the floods in @entity106 though no explanation was offered for the differing levels of acceptance of mankind ’s role in global warming there seems to be a divide between those countries that are developing and those that are highly industrialized			2
developing countries are more likely to suffer the consequences of global warming such as increased occurrence of natural disasters , and have less to lose economically in admitting that human behavior , such as heavy industries , is a contributing factor			0
this may explain why populations in less industrialised countries are more willing to believe mankind needs to change it ’s behaviour to combat global warming .			2
