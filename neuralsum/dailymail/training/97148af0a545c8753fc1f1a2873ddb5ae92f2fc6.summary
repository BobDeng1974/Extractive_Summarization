two million people are at risk from a toxic fog that has descended over @entity3 as pollution levels in @entity5 reach an all - time high			1
the icy fog has smothered the @entity7 for several weeks and trapped lung - busting soot emitted in the city underneath			1
the level of pollution in the city is now the highest in @entity12 according to the @entity13 and medical experts are now urging residents to stay indoors			1
health emergency : a toxic cloud caused by fog trapping pollution underneath hangs over @entity5 warning : doctors - including dr @entity21 , pictured - are urging @entity3 residents to stay indoors to avoid inhaling the toxic air over the smog over @entity5 has been caused by a temperature inversion - where warmer air creates a barrier above cold fog so everything underneath is trapped the smog over @entity5 , which is surrounded by the @entity31 and @entity32 mountain ranges , has been caused by a temperature inversion where warmer air has created a barrier above cold fog so everything underneath is trapped			1
snow cover on the surrounding mountains has amplified the phenomena , leaving @entity5 at just 18 degrees while @entity39 basks in sunny 43 - degree weather			2
the warmer air aloft has acted like a lid on the frigid valley air , leaving it with no place to go			0
the pollution is now getting so bad that more than 100 @entity3 doctors are calling for authorities to immediately lower highway speed limits , curb industrial activity and make mass transit free for the rest of winter			1
travelwise : residents have already been asked to cut down their travel to prevent more petrol emissions adding to the pollution off the charts : there are now 130 micrograms of soot per cubic meter in @entity5 - three times the federal clean - air limit doctors say the microscopic soot - a shower of combustion particles from tailpipe and other emissions - can tax the lungs of even healthy people			1
' we 're in a public - health emergency for much of the winter , ' said @entity73 , a 62 - year - old anesthesiologist and president of @entity3 physicians for a @entity76 , which delivered the petition demanding action at the @entity80			1
the greater @entity81 had up to 130 micrograms of soot per cubic meter - more than three times the federal clean - air limit , according to the @entity12 @entity13			1
and for two million @entity3 residents , there is no escape from the fog , except to the snow - capped mountains surrounding the city or resort towns like @entity39 , where the @entity92 is under way			1
dangerous : doctors warn the pollution levels are still toxic to people without any health issues capped : the polluted fog is trapped under a warmer layer of air that is acting like a lid on top of cooler air authorities have already prohibited wood burning and urged people to limit driving			1
vehicle emissions account for more than half of the trapped pollutants			0
@entity3 regulators are working on a set of plans to limit everyday emissions , including a measure to ban the sale of aerosol deodorants and hair spray that contain hydrocarbon propellants			1
those plans , however , will take years to show results			0
doctors say people - especially pregnant women and children - should stay indoors , or at least avoid active outdoor exercise under the sickening yellowish haze			2
elderly people with heart disease are most at risk , @entity73 said			0
the most polluted : the @entity12 @entity13 has singled out the greater @entity81 as having @entity12 's worst levels of pollution above the fog : the air around the mountains above @entity5 - on of @entity12 's top ski resorts - is completely clear time for change : @entity5 residents have already been prohibited from wood burning but doctors are calling for more stringent measures ' if you can see it , you do n't want to breathe it			1
think about what 's going into your body , ' @entity5 pediatrician @entity144 said			0
' it 's essentially like smoking			0
instead of breathing clean air , you 're breathing particles that make it harder for your lungs to function and get oxygen			2
' smog is caused by a weather phenomenon known as an inversion layer			0
this happens when warm air mass moves over the top of an area with cooler air			0
the warmer air then acts like a lid on top - effectively trapping everything underneath			2
over cities , this then causes a build - up of pollution as fumes and emissions have no where to escape to			2
severe inversions can last for several weeks and cause respiratory problems for the inhabitants in the areas trapped underneath			0
a previous example of this happening was the great smog of @entity179 in 1952 which caused thousands of deaths			0
for weeks , industrialized cities in northern @entity182 have been dealing with bouts of sickening smog several times more toxic than @entity3 's			1
but by @entity12 standards , @entity3 's pollution index is off the charts with readings routinely exceeding a scale that tops out at 70 micrograms a cubic meter			1
the @entity13 sets a standard for clean air at no more than 35 micrograms			1
' people think the health implications are limited to asthma - that 's only a drop in the bucket , ' @entity73 said			2
' for every pregnant woman breathing this stuff , this is a threat to her fetus through chromosome damage			0
' it sets people up for a lifelong propensity for all sorts of diseases			0
' mother @entity208 has seen the effects of the toxic fog firsthand as her nine - year - old daughter now suffers from chronic asthma			0
the air pollution is so awful in her @entity5 suburb that @entity215 keeps her daughter indoors on many days to prevent her cough from being aggravated			2
' when you add all the gunk in the air , it 's too much , ' @entity215 said			0
the @entity3 health emergency comes as a deep arctic freeze has locked parts of the @entity225 to the @entity226 in their fourth day of glacial temperatures felt as low as -36f degrees			1
in @entity230 , water froze on firefighters ’ gloves almost as soon as it left their hoses as they attempted to battle a fire , while an entire façade of a building located on the city ’s @entity237 was coated in sheets of ice			0
in @entity243 's @entity242 , commuters similarly woke to temperatures around 12 - degrees today , but with wind gusts of 15 - 20 mph , it felt more like five below as people started their work day			0
the cold snap arrived on saturday night as waves of @entity252 air swept south from @entity253 , pushing temperatures to dangerous lows and leaving a section of the country well - versed in winter 's pains reeling			2
it is expected to last several more days			0
cold snap : trucks in @entity230 are frozen in place under sheets of ice as an @entity252 blast continues to grip the @entity12 @entity225 and @entity226 frozen to the spot : temperatures have dropped as low as 50 degrees below zero @entity266 ( -46c ) tricky situation : firefighters were attempting to tackle a blaze at this warehouse in @entity230 but their water froze as soon as it left the hoses			2

health emergency *declared* @entity3 where pollution is now the worst in @entity12
the greater @entity81 had up to 130 micrograms of soot per cubic meter - more than three times the federal clean - air limit
more than 100 @entity3 doctors are calling for immediate action
