her family now believe the teenager died of toxic shock syndrome - a bacterial infection which affects just 40 people a year in @entity20			1
posting on @entity26 , her family - which includes her mother @entity22 , 52 , brother @entity23 , stepfather @entity24 and stepmother @entity25 - have launched a campaign to raise awareness of the condition so other sufferers spot the signs earlier			2
they said : ' @entity0 died of toxic shock syndrome the first time that she used tampons			1
' generally speaking , it is accepted knowledge that leaving a tampon in for too long can cause toxic shock syndrome			1
in @entity0 â€™s case , she followed all of the instructions and used the tampon correctly ; it was simply the introduction of the tampon into her body which caused toxic shock syndrome to take effect			1
' @entity48 became ill five days before she died but remained in good spirits , and only the evening before she died , she was telling @entity22 off for fussing over her , and saying that she was feeling much better			0
' she died peacefully at approximately 6.45am on @entity10 after falling asleep watching one of her favourite tv programs			2

@entity53 was in a coma for two days and later transferred to @entity64 , with her mother @entity65 , 39 , sitting beside her bed and planning her funeral			0
the teenager highlighted the case in 2011 after she returned to school , determined to let others know what had happened and what to look out for			0
she said : ' i still feel ill some days but i am getting my strength back			0
i just want it to be a lot more known than it is			0
' ' we can not express how much we miss our beautiful , gifted , kind and funny @entity0			2
all of our family , and many others close to us , are still reeling from the shock of losing our wonderful girl			2
' we hope that you and your family never have to go through what we have gone through , and are still going through			0
' @entity0 , who was found dead by her father @entity87 , was described as an ' all - singing and all - dancing ' youngster who enjoyed acting and playing the guitar			2
she had been selected last year to perform in a backing choir for @entity92 tenor @entity91 at one of @entity12 ' most prestigious concert halls , @entity95 , @entity96			2
after @entity0 's death it was initially believed she had fallen victim to septicaemia , better known as blood poisoning			0
toxic shock syndrome affects about 40 people each year in the @entity20			1
the infection is caused when usually harmless staphylococcus aureus or @entity107 bacteria , which live on the skin , invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins			0
a statement from @entity112 said : ' it 's not exactly understood why using a tampon is linked with toxic shock syndrome , but tampon absorbency ( the amount of menstrual blood a tampon absorbs ) is thought to be a factor			1
' if you 're a woman using tampons , use a tampon with the lowest absorbency suitable for your menstrual blood flow , change your tampon frequently , use a sanitary towel or panty liner from time to time during your period , never insert more than one tampon at one time and use a sanitary towel at night instead of a tampon			0
' the family of @entity0 , left , say she died from toxic shock syndrome after using her first tampon			1
@entity58 schoolgirl @entity53 , right , said in 2011 that the same condition put her in a coma for two days the family said : ' we thought that one thing we could do , to honour @entity0 , and to help others , would be to start an awareness campaign about toxic shock syndrome			1
' we are in communication with @entity12 , the two main tampon companies , and we have already had some success with @entity150 and with the education system in @entity152			0
all the age - appropriate pupils attending schools in @entity152 have been made aware of toxic shock syndrome			1
' we are determined to make at least everyone in the @entity20 aware of what the symptoms are , and what the risks are			0
' streptococcus bacteria live on the skin toxic shock syndrome is a highly dangerous bacterial infection - but it can be misdiagnosed , because the symptoms are the same as other illnesses and because it is so rare			1
it occurs when usually harmless staphylococcus aureus or @entity107 bacteria , which live on the skin , invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins			0
this causes a sudden high fever , a massive drop in blood pressure resulting in dizziness and confusion , and occasionally vomiting and diarrhoea			0
other symptoms - none of which are exclusive to toxic shock syndrome , which is extremely rare - include a sunburn - like skin rash , the whites of the eyes becoming red or pink and the shedding of the skin in large sheets , especially from the palms of the hands and soles of the feet , one or two weeks after becoming ill. women are most at risk of getting toxic shock syndrome during menstruation and particularly if they are using tampons , have recently given birth , or are using an internal barrier contraceptive such as a diaphragm .			1
