by @entity0 last updated at 12:09 pm on 13th september 2011 priorities : @entity2 joins the metropolitan police at a time of change and difficulty a plain - speaking police chief renowned for his ruthless obsession with cutting crime was yesterday appointed head of the beleaguered @entity11			1
@entity2 , 53 , vowed to put fear back in the minds of criminals after winning the race to become commissioner at @entity17			1
@entity19 ’s new top officer faces an enormous task trying to restore morale in the @entity11 in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal , widespread criticism of the force ’s handling of the @entity28 riots and concerns about burglary and robbery figures			1
he will also assume overall responsbility for counter-terrorism in the run up to next year ’s @entity35 in @entity28			0
mr @entity2 is the force ’s third chief appointed in six years following the controversial exits of his two predecessors , sir @entity39 and sir @entity40 , making it the hottest seat in @entity19 policing			1
he was handed a five - year contract after convincing interviewers he could lead a ‘ new , more transparent ’ era for the force			0
the former @entity49 chief constable could not disguise his delight at landing the job			2
‘ it ’s the highest accolade that any police officer could have , ’ he said			0
outlining his targets , he added : ‘ the idea is to make the criminals fear the police and what they are doing now			0
’ one of mr @entity2 ’s priorities will be ensuring the @entity35 pass off peacefully at a time of unprecedented police funding squeezes			2
he is expected to run a tight ship at the yard and will move quickly to shake up the @entity11 ’s senior management team			2
assistant commissioner @entity65 is tipped as a strong contender to be his deputy			1
mr @entity2 beat off a strong challenge from sir @entity69 , the much respected but outspoken president of the @entity70 , to land the £ 276,000 a year job			1
the other contenders were acting commissioner @entity73 , who now reverts to being deputy commissioner but who is expected to leave the @entity11 in the next few months , and @entity77 ’s chief constable @entity76			1
a number of members of the @entity80 were keen for sir @entity69 to be appointed but home secretary @entity82 , who has been angered by sir @entity69 ’s attacks on government policy , was never likely to sanction such a move			0
announcement : @entity2 , centre , was chosen by home secretary @entity82 , left , and mayor of london @entity89 , right , to be the new @entity17 commissioner resignations : former metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity40 , left , and deputy commissioner @entity91 , right , both left the force in the wake of the @entity96 phone hacking scandal unsuccessful : sir @entity69 had been widely tipped for the top job she said : ‘ @entity2 has an excellent track record as a tough single - minded crime fighter			1
he showed that in his time as chief constable of @entity49 , and i ’m sure he ’s going to bring those skills and that ability to fight crime to the @entity11 here in @entity28			1
’ @entity28 mayor @entity89 said : ‘ it was a very strong field but i think the home secretary and i were agreed that @entity2 ’s performance was outstanding , and he really commended himself above all by his relentless focus on building on the work of sir @entity40 and @entity73 in driving down crime			1
’ mr @entity2 was parachuted into the @entity11 as acting deputy commissioner after sir @entity40 and @entity19 ’s anti-terror chief , assistant commissioner @entity91 , quit in quick succession			1
the surprise move was a clear indication that he was in line for the top job on a permanent basis			0
he had previously been working for @entity123			0
untouchable : @entity2 has been compared to legendary @entity126 lawman @entity125 ( pictured as played on tv by @entity128 ) @entity2 is an advocate of zero tolerance policing and waged what he called a ‘ total war on crime ’ against the gangsters and villains of @entity49 when he was chief constable there			1
during his five years in charge , from 2004 to 2009 , crime was reduced by almost a third and anti-social behaviour by 25 per cent			2
a force which had once been rated the worst in the country for public confidence became one of the country ’s best			0
everyone from vandals to drug - takers to fare dodgers was targeted			0
and , when mr @entity2 was unhappy with the sentences they were given by the courts , he was not afraid to say so			2
he has been nicknamed @entity125 – the legendary lawman in @entity153 whose hand - picked team of @entity155 brought down @entity156 – for his zero - tolerance on gun and knife crime			0
mr @entity2 led his officers in @entity49 as they investigated some of the most sensitive and appalling crimes of recent years , including the racist killing of @entity164 , a black student , with an ice axe and the gun murder of 11 - year - old @entity167 – the innocent victim of a gangland feud			1
the @entity167 investigation , considered incredibly challenging because of the culture of silence attached to gangs , saw officers cleverly recruit a teenage supergrass as their main prosecution witness in order to crack the case			0
such experiences will stand him in good stead at the @entity11 , where tackling the gang culture blamed for last month ’s riots will be one of his most important jobs			2
he will also need all his experience of handling delicate racial problems in the wake of the fatal shooting which proved the trigger for widespread destruction			0
the married 53 - year - old , an avid football fan who is a tough - tackler on the pitch , began his career in his native @entity196 in 1979			0
identified as a high - flyer , he was sent to @entity198 by the police			0
he has an ma in law from @entity198 , a diploma in applied criminology from the @entity204 and an mba from the @entity206			0
if that sets alarm bells ringing – the very politically - correct sir @entity39 had a similarly academic background – mr @entity2 is said to have drawn experience from another @entity211 commissioner : sir @entity212			1
as an assistant commissioner at the @entity11 from 2001 to 2004 , he watched as sir @entity91 ran the force with an iron - grip , leaving his officers in no doubt of what was expected of them			1
he will need a similarly robust attitude to bring order to the @entity11 now			2
but few who saw him in action in @entity49 doubt he is up to the challenge .			0
