@entity0 funnelled an astonishing £ 6billion through the tax haven of @entity2 in a year – while paying just 0.1 per cent of that amount in @entity5 corporation tax			1
official documents reveal that by exploiting the tiny tax haven the internet giant halved its global tax bill in 2011 – leaving governments , including the @entity5 , out of pocket by more than £ 1billion			1
in the same year the firm legally arranged its accounts to surrender just £ 6million in corporation tax in the @entity5			1
the startling revelations came yesterday as @entity15 called on world leaders to launch a global crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals			1
googleplexed : by funneling the money through @entity2 , @entity21 , pictured , only paid 0.1 per cent in @entity5 corporation tax avoiding paying over £ 1billion in taxes to various governments in a letter to @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and other @entity30 chiefs , the prime minister said co-ordinated action is needed to make major corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of tax			1
mr @entity15 said : ‘ i do believe we all have a common interest in being able to tell our taxpayers who work hard and pay their fair share of taxes that we will make sure others do the same			2
’ his intervention follows a year in which the tax affairs of multinationals and wealthy individuals have come under intense scrutiny and criticism in the @entity5			0
bold steps : @entity15 urged fellow @entity30 leaders to crack down on tax dodging by international companies major firms such as @entity0 , @entity53 and @entity54 were described as ‘ immoral ’ by mps on the @entity56 following revelations about the legal loopholes they exploit to reduce their corporation tax liabilities in this country to almost nothing			1
last month @entity54 was shamed into offering to pay £ 20million to the @entity63 over two years following a public backlash and consumer boycott			0
but campaigners say a systematic drive is now needed to close down tax loopholes across the world			0
official documents revealed that the amount @entity0 is diverting offshore has almost doubled over the past three years			2
they also show the extraordinary lengths taken by the firm to avoid tax			0
@entity0 ’s @entity5 boss @entity76 admitted to mps last year that the company uses @entity2 , a renowned tax shelter where firms are not forced to pay a penny on their profits , to hide some of its money			1
@entity0 lowered its @entity5 tax bill for 2011 by more than £ 200million by pushing £ 2.6billion of @entity5 revenues offshore			1
@entity88 chairman @entity87 said he is ‘ very proud ’ of the elaborate structure which enabled it to pay so little			0
now official documents have emerged showing the full extent of the labyrinthine payments			0
@entity0 lists its employees and operations based in the @entity5 as a ‘ service arm ’ – which reports considerably smaller revenues			2
the firm uses an @entity99 subsidiary to collect advertising revenues from @entity5 and other nations			0
the @entity99 group then pays royalties to another @entity99 company , and these payments are then transferred to a holding company in the @entity107 , which has its tax base in @entity2			1
last year the payments to this @entity107 group , which has no registered employees , were £ 6.1billion , according to official documents filed by the company			0
this is an increase of 81 per cent on the £ 3.4billion sheltered in the company in 2008			0
by using this complex structure to push revenues offshore , @entity0 cuts its global tax bill in half – as the amount sheltered is equal to around 80 per cent of its pre-tax profits from last year			1
@entity122 ' heaven : @entity0 's haven of choice , @entity2 , is a renowned for their tax laws which do not force companies to pay tax on their profits the same official documents show that @entity0 ’s tax rate outside of the @entity132 was just 3.2 per cent last year , even though the vast majority of its operations are in @entity136 countries where tax rates vary between 26 and 34 per cent			1
the findings are ‘ a deep embarrassment to governments across @entity136 ’ , said tax accountant @entity141			0
‘ the only people who benefit from this policy are @entity0 ’s management			2
‘ as well as short - changing taxpayers , the company ’s shareholders are short - changed because the money is locked away in @entity2			2
‘ management is denying shareholders any prospects of the dividends they deserve for investing in the company			0
’ the chancellor has announced he will this year bring in a general anti-abuse rule to clamp down on tax avoidance – which is legal but viewed as morally questionable			0
the @entity5 yesterday took over the 12 - month revolving presidency of the @entity30 group of leading industrialised countries			2
in his letter to fellow leaders mr @entity15 urged them to start work now on preparing ‘ bold steps ’ to take when they meet in @entity166 in june for the @entity30 ’s annual summit			1
he warned he would not allow a summit where rich nations ‘ simply whip out a chequebook at the 11th hour , pledge some money and call it a success ’ .			0

@entity0 funneled £ 6billion to @entity2 , avoiding £ 1billion tax bill
