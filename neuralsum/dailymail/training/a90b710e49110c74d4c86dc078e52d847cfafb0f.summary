at a 3 a.m. news conference , @entity7 said it was his decision to keep the advisory in place at least into the morning hours , even though latest test results suggest the algae - induced toxin contaminating @entity48 had probably dissipated to safe levels			1
the mayor said two tests had come back ' too close for comfort			2

' we 're going through a lot			0
i know by tomorrow , we 're going to be looking for water again , ' he said			2

but no serious illnesses had been reported by late sunday			0

amid the emergency , discussion began to center around how to stop the pollutants fouling the lake that supplies drinking water for 11 million people			1
' people are finally waking up to the fact that this is not acceptable , ' @entity7 said			0
the toxins that contaminated the region 's drinking water supply did n't just suddenly appear			0
water plant operators along western @entity48 have long been worried about this very scenario as a growing number of algae blooms have turned the water into a pea soup color in recent summers , leaving behind toxins that can sicken people and kill pets			1
in fact , the problems on the shallowest of the five @entity119 brought on by farm runoff and sludge from sewage treatment plants have been building for more than a decade			1
the @entity124 released a satellite image showing a small but concentrated algae bloom centered right where @entity1 draws its water supply , said @entity128 , head of the @entity130 research lab. water crisis : @entity132 directs military vehicles carrying fresh drinking water , sunday , august 3 , 2014 , at @entity135 in @entity1 @entity137 menace : this satellite image provided by @entity124 shows the algae bloom on @entity48 in 2011 which according to @entity124 was the worst in decades the bloom was much smaller than in past years and is n't expected to peak until early september			2
but instead of being pushed out to the middle of the lake , winds and waves drove the algae toward the shore , he said			0
' weather conditions made it such that bloom was going right into the water intakes , ' said @entity128 , who has been studying the lake since the 1970s , when it was severely polluted			0
the amount of phosphorus going into the lake has risen every year since the mid- 1990s			0

that was believed to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water because of toxins from algae in the lake			2
researchers largely blame the algae 's resurgence on manure and chemical fertilizer from farms that wash into the lake along with sewage treatment plants			1
leaky septic tanks and stormwater drains have contributed , too			0
combined , they flush huge amounts of phosphorus into the lake			0

@entity4 lawmakers this past spring took a step toward tackling the algae problem when they enacted a law requiring most farmers to undergo training before they use commercial fertilizers on their fields			1
but they have stopped short of mandating restrictions on farmers			0
the @entity219 , an advisory agency made up of @entity221 and @entity222 officials , said last year urgent steps are needed to reduce phosphorus applied to fields , suggesting among other things that states ban the spread of manure on frozen or snow - covered ground			2
that report came after a state task force in @entity4 called for a 40 percent reduction in all forms of phosphorus going into the lake			2
