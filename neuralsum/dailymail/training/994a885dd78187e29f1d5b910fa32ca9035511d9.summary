by @entity0 published : 01:23 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 21 september 2012 @entity1 has gone back to the drawing board to re-design the classic 1960s @entity3 and make it fit for the 21st century as it today celebrates its 50th anniversary			1
@entity6 ’s chief designer @entity5 undertook the commission to mark five decades of the original @entity9 - built @entity8 , which was launched in 1962 to great acclaim			1
the commission came courtesy of motoring magazine @entity13 , which wanted to know how the car giant might transform the legendary family saloon car and re-invent it for today			1
the re-designed @entity16 combines parts of the iconic bodywork with the manufacturer 's latest technology memorable design : the new @entity3 displays recognisable nods to the legendary model the original @entity16 was launched 50 years ago today on september 21 , 1962 , costing from £ 573 for the standard 1200 saloon			1
today a similar car range would cost from between £ 16,000 and £ 22,000			1
auto express editor @entity26 said : ’ @entity1 is celebrating 50 years of the @entity8 and we ’ve got them to design a @entity3 for 2012 – meeting all today ’s regulations , but with the size and style of the original			1
‘ we told him we were n’t looking for a new take on the original but wanted him to stay as true to the design of the original as possible , but with every modern bit of technology and safety built in			1
new look : the updated @entity8 design features a wider rear windscreen and a lower , sleeker roofline crumple zones would have to be added and the supporting pillars around the windscreen thickened for the @entity8 to pass modern safety tests ‘ we effectively wanted a hi - tech , five - star crash test rated , pedestrian friendly @entity49			1
. not much to ask			2
’ the original @entity16 was launched 50 years ago on september 21 , 1962			1
it cost from £ 573 for the standard 1200 saloon			2
a similar car range today would cost from between £ 16,000 and £ 22,000			1
there were five generations of @entity3 : the @entity56 ( 1962 - 66 ) ; @entity57 ( 66 to 70 ) ; @entity58 ( 70 to 76 ) , @entity59 ( 76 to 79 ) and @entity60 ( 79 to 82 )			2
the original @entity3 with a 1.2 litre 4 cylinder petrol engine had a top speed of 76.5mph , took 20 seconds to get to 60mph from rest , and fuel economy of 30.2mpg			1
the souped - up @entity65 had a top speed of 108mph and could sprint from rest to 60mph in 10.1 seconds and averaged 21.3mph			2
the 21st century @entity3 with its frugal @entity70 litre 3 - cylinder engine will sprint to 60 mph in 10 seconds with a top speed of 120mph and would average 56.5mpg			2
some 4.3million @entity73 were produced over 20 years from 1962			0
the last @entity3 was assembled in july 1982 , to be succeeded by the @entity74 costing £ 4,515			0
the @entity3 was @entity76 's best - selling car for 10 of the 20 years it was on sale : 1967 , 1972 , 1973 , 1974 , 1975 , 1977 , 1978 , 1979 , 1980 and 1981			0
@entity76 sales for the @entity16 totalled 2,816,639 and its best - selling month of all time was 25,790 in august 1981			0
total @entity16 production was 4,279,079 , of which 3,155,161 were built at @entity9			0
@entity8 assembly also took place in @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , @entity86 , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) and at @entity89 ( @entity90 i only )			0
the @entity16 has made dozens of film and tv appearances including @entity94 released in 1963			1
the @entity57 model turned up in productions as diverse as @entity97 – driven by @entity98 who , in reality , did n’t have a driving licence at the time – and the @entity102			1
@entity1 designer @entity5 said : ‘ the original car was accessible and agile			1
the body shape is really iconic and those ‘ ban the bomb ’ tail - lights are so recognisable			0
‘ but obviously we ’ve got a host of global legal requirements we need to meet			0
‘ we also need it to be recognisable as a @entity1 from the outside			0
the original designers would have had a tight brief limited by the fact that they had to make it profitable			1
’ the original @entity8 design – with a jutting front bumper and sharp edges , would not pass today ’s vitally important @entity121 crash tests to protect driver , occupants and even pedestrians , he says			1
crumple zones would have to be designed in , the supporting pillars around the windscreen thickened and the windows made shallower to survive side impacts			0
the distinctive rear tail - lights are retained but given a sharper and more modern look			0
the two sharp ridges or ‘ pontoons ’ on the boot are retained in the 2012 version			0
but a wider rear windscreen is needed to ensure all - round visibility			0
and a lower , sleeker roofline is needed to fit with modern sporty taste			0
the boom in demand for diesel engines which are bigger and need more cooling , would require a bigger front opening			0
but @entity1 ’s new frugal 1.0 litre three - cylinder @entity146 petrol engine would be the perfect fit while satisfying today ’s demand for fuel economy and performance , managing the sprint from rest to 62mph in about 10 seconds – compared with 20 seconds for the original - with a top speed of about 120mph			1
this is despite the extra demands of technology and safety pushing the weight of a new @entity8 up by 50 per cent to 1.2 tonnes , compared to 0.8 tonnes for the original in the @entity160			1
that means more powerful brakes are needed and the chassis would have to be strengthened to cope			0
air - conditioning , bluetooth connectivity and @entity167 digital radio would be musts today			2
the original @entity169 with a 1.2 litre 4 cylinder petrol engine had a top speed of 76.5mph , took 20 seconds to get to 60mph from rest , and fuel economy of 30.2mpg			2
the souped - up @entity65 had a top speed of 108mph and could sprint from rest to 60mph in 10.1 seconds and averaged 21.3mph			0
the 21st century @entity3 with its frugal @entity70 litre 3 - cylinder engine will sprint to 60 mph in 10 seconds with a top speed of 120mph and would average 56.5mpg			0
there were five generations of @entity3 : the @entity56 ( 1962 - 66 ) ; @entity57 ( 66 to 70 ) ; @entity58 ( 70 to 76 ) , @entity59 ( 76 to 79 ) and @entity60 ( 79 to 82 )			0
heyday : a 1976 @entity183 , complete with jutting front bumper and sharp edges a four - door @entity188 in the new design , the distinctive rear tail - lights are retained but given a sharper and more modern look			2
@entity190 editor mr @entity26 said : ’ it all seems a world away from the simple , original car that made such a splash in the @entity160			2
but these days buyers are more demanding			0
we want our cars to be practical , efficient and hi - tech – all for a great price			0
’ more than a million of the original @entity200 ’s were built between 1962 and 1966 with total @entity16 production topping nearly 4.3million by the time the @entity59 came to the end of the road in 1982			1
celebrated in song , in poetry by sir @entity206 , in movies and on tv , some 3.15million @entity73 were built at @entity1 ’s @entity9 plant in @entity210 , now given over to engine production			1
will @entity1 put their designer mr @entity5 ’s 2012 version into production and bring back the @entity8 name ? lovely to think so – but do n’t hold your breath .			2

the original design would not pass today ’s crash tests
mkii model turned up in tv programmes including the @entity102
