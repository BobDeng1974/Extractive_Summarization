by @entity0 around 2.4 billion years ago , oxygen levels increased and gave rise to life as we know it			1
before this time , the lack of oxygen in @entity8 ’s oceans and land would have made animal and plant life impossible			2
but now scientists have found evidence of ‘ oxygen oases ’ that formed before the 2.4 billion year figure commonly cited , suggesting that the first steps toward life may have started earlier than first thought			1
researchers have ' found ' ancient oxygen in so - called shallow shelf pools ( stock image shown ) and shallow seas			1
they were studying rocks 2.8 billion years old in @entity26 , @entity27			1
within the rocks they found limestone unchanged since its formation , which only could have formed with oxygen present in a separate study , scientists say that life on @entity8 could have started in volcanic vents on the seafloor			1
researchers have developed a new approach to simulating the processes that may have led to the emergence of cell metabolism on @entity8 - a crucial biological function for all living organisms			2
the research could help scientists understand whether it is possible for life to have emerged in similar environments on other worlds			0
co-author @entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ' what we are trying to do is to bridge the gap between the geological processes of the early @entity8 and the emergence of biological life on this planet			0
' previously , some scientists have proposed that living organisms may have been transported to @entity8 by meteorites			0
however , there is more support for the theory that life emerged on @entity8 in places like hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor , forming from inanimate matter such as the chemical compounds found in gases and minerals			2
the researchers , led by dr @entity74 of the @entity75 , collected 2.8 - billion - year old rock samples from @entity26 in @entity77 , @entity27 reports @entity78			1
the area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed			0
when analysing the rocks they found that the limestone had remained unchanged for 2.8 billion years - a key indicator oxygen was once there			1
@entity89 can only form when calcium carbonate - its main constituent - is stripped of its dissolved iron			2
for this to happen oxygen must be present , as it interacts with dissolved iron to form iron - rich minerals			0
the appearance of limestone pre-dating than 2.4 billion years ago , therefore , suggests that oxygen must have been forming before it became widespread			1
the origin of this oxygen was likely bacteria , which pumped out oxygen from cleaner water			0
and incredibly these oases were thought to exist for just 5 million years before sea levels rose and the oases were swallowed up			0
dr @entity74 of the @entity75 and his colleagues collected rock samples 2.8 billion years old from @entity26 in @entity77 , @entity27 ( shown )			1
the area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed			0
and when analysing the rocks they found limestone that had remained unchanged current evidence suggests that eukaryotes , life such as algae [ stock image shown ] , did not appear on @entity8 until about 2 billion years ago			1
dr @entity74 says ' it is possible that the build - up of oxygen levels in early oases such as @entity128 could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution ' however , the appearance of oxygen at the time would have been poisonous to most bacteria , meaning they would have had to evolve a defence mechanism from the gas before it went ‘ global ’			1
and perhaps this early exposure to the once ' poisonous ' gas gave organisms the ability they needed to become oxygen - breathers , and gave rise to life as we know it			1
‘ figuring out just when and where oxygen first accumulated in abundance has been a puzzle , ’ dr @entity74 tells @entity147			0
‘ our suggestion that the limestones preserved at @entity154 in @entity27 represent a 2800 million year old oxygen oasis is novel because it is the first time that an oxygen oasis has been specifically identified			2
’ dr @entity74 continued : ‘ over the past 2,800 million years or more oxygen has built up progressively to the point where today ’s oceans are almost entirely oxygenated and today ’s atmosphere contains 20 per cent oxygen			2
‘ @entity163 is essential for eukaryotes ( all animal and plant life )			0
‘ current evidence suggests that eukaryotes ( such as algae ) did not appear on @entity8 until about 2,000 million years ago or younger			2
‘ there is no evidence of eukaryotes at @entity154			0
but it is possible that the build - up of oxygen levels in early oases such as @entity128 could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution			0
‘ however , as we point out , the @entity154 oasis may not have survived for longer than about 5 million years , so the transient nature of these early oases could have been an obstacle to sustained development of early eukaryotes			0

researchers from the @entity75 ' find ' ancient oxygen
they were studying rocks 2.8 billion years old in @entity26 , @entity27
within the rocks they found limestone unchanged since its formation
@entity89 could only have formed if oxygen had existed at the time
but oxygen only began to enter the oceans about 2.4 billion years ago
this suggests bacteria began forming oxygen before it went global
and to survive what was then a poisonous gas they would have needed to develop a defence mechanism - *ultimately* giving rise to life as we know it
