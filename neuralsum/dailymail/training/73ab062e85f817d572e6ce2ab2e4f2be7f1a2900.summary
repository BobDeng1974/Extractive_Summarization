doctors probing the death of dr @entity2 wrote to the chief coroner yesterday calling for his inquest to be resumed and the suicide verdict re-examined			1
in a letter to judge @entity7 , they said there had been ‘ deficiencies in legal processes ’ that meant the government scientist ’s inquest had never been formally closed , no final death certificate had been issued and no cause of death had been confirmed by a coroner			1
they also said the first police officer at the scene had changed his account of how the body was positioned , bolstering claims that it had been moved			0
dr @entity2 in 2003 during the last interview he gave before committing suicide in @entity26			0
dr @entity2 ’s body was found near his @entity26 home in 2003 shortly after he was identified as the source of a @entity32 report about an official dossier on @entity35 weapons of mass destruction			0
the doctors , led by radiologist @entity38 , have long campaigned for a full inquiry into how dr @entity2 died			2
they argue that the @entity40 , which effectively superseded the work of the @entity26 coroner @entity42 , was inadequate			1
they say @entity44 merely accepted the opinion of the pathologist without proper investigation and lacked the experience , qualification or legal authority to confirm the cause of death			1
they wrote : ' any reasonable person would accept that the lack of adequate inquiry into the cause of death and the production of the new , uninvestigated evidence relating to the suicide conclusion provides overwhelming and exceptional reasons for this inquest to be resumed , the cause of death properly investigated , any new evidence admitted , the cause of death properly certified and the proceedings formally closed			2
' the letter said that @entity44 ( left ) did not investigate the death properly			0
attorney general @entity65 ( right ) rejected calls for an inquest in 2011 in the letter , which has been copied to the lord chief justice , the lord chancellor and the @entity26 coroner , they call for the inquest to be resumed with witnesses giving evidence under oath , in front of a jury			0
they said relevant members of @entity81 police should be called to give evidence and all information made available to the @entity40 provided for consideration			1
the suicide verdict should be proved beyond all doubt , they said			0
the @entity40 found that dr @entity2 committed suicide in the woods near his house in @entity26			1
the attorney general @entity65 rejected calls for an inquest in 2011 following a lengthy review of the case			0
mr @entity65 found there was no possibility that an inquest would reach a different conclusion from the @entity40 , which found in 2004 that @entity2 committed suicide .			2

they have *written* to judge @entity7 calling for further investigation
the doctors claim that there had been ' deficiencies in legal processes '
they want members of @entity111 to give evidence over to the @entity40
