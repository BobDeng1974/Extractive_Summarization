even at this level , this is a fixture that nobody wants to lose , where neither side will give an inch			0
this encounter was no exception , the two teams eventually sharing the spoils			0
@entity9 against @entity10 always brings up the mercury , raising the tension in the dugout and on the pitch			1
in this sense , it was a little odd to see one of @entity20 football 's most famous clashes diluted into a rather timid affair			0
as @entity23 watched on , now a coach with his former club , he may have secretly pined for a return to the visceral intensity that we are accustomed to when @entity9 meet @entity10			1
get in ! @entity10 's youngsters celebrate after @entity30 scored a free - kick in front of the @entity33 youth coaches continue to agonise over the absence of a competitive edge in the @entity40 - 21 leagues and with a smallish crowd in attendance , the usual aggro and needle was absent			1
some will welcome the more cerebral and tactical approach and it was certainly pleasant to see @entity20 talent comfortable in fluid formations			0
@entity9 , in particular , are a curious watch these days , at any age group			0
the @entity49 philosophy is filtering down into @entity51 's reserve side and @entity9 played for the second consecutive league game with the 3 - 5 - 2 system that the @entity54 is attempting to instill into his senior players			2
the thinking is that it will prepare players for the step up as @entity59 looks to unearth the latest young gems from the @entity9 academy			0
comeback : @entity9 under 21s had to show character to come back from a goal down @entity9 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( c ) , @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 , 55 ) ; @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity66 subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 @entity10 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity30 ( @entity89 , 79 ) ; @entity90 ( @entity91 , 72 ) , @entity92 , @entity93 subs not used : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 referee : @entity99 for an hour or so , both sides appeared to lacked the wit or know - how to force a breakthrough			1
a steady @entity9 performance yearned for the inspiration of @entity90 , the club 's most exciting talent who scored four against @entity108 just a few weeks ago			2
he has been training with the first - team , his performances a cut above at this level			2
several other rising stars , such as @entity115 and @entity116 , are also in line to be heavily involved when @entity49 's first team travel to @entity119 this weekend			0
on another night , this team could also have included the mercurial talents of @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity10 were missing @entity123 , who took his place in the smart seats			2
as it was , this was a @entity9 performance of measured control , exuding a calm authority in possession and discipline without the ball			0
@entity68 was a commanding force at centre - half , taking any encroachment into the penalty area as a personal affront			1
it is a surprise @entity59 is yet to involve him in the first - team set - up			0
it is clear @entity9 are still learning in this system and the coach @entity142 was guiding his players throughout , urging young @entity75 to fill the pockets of space in the @entity147 role and gesticulating at @entity72 , a holding midfielder , to get tighter to @entity10 's bright young talent @entity87			1
equaliser : @entity76 levels things up from close range despite the close attention of @entity154 defenders initially , this was a slow burner , devoid of vibrancy and imagination			1
@entity10 tried the harder to build some momentum , underpinned by the movement of @entity92 , who harried @entity9 's defenders at every opportunity			2
when goalkeeper @entity162 received the ball , @entity92 was there in a flash , closing down a clearance that very nearly rebounded into the goal			0
@entity9 's attacking forays were notable only for a whippped delivery across the goalmouth , when @entity67 timed his run , caught it with the instep , but somehow diverted wide with the goal gaping			0
the breakthrough , when it came just past the hour mark , was worth the wait			0
@entity30 had already given @entity9 advance notice of his potency from range , crafting one curling effort inches wide of @entity162 's goal in the first - half			1
it was his free - kick from 25 yards that opened the scoring , drilled hard and low into the right - hand corner of the goal			1
not settling for a point : @entity76 headed for the centre circle after scoring the equaliser @entity9 's response was instant , as if they suddenly remembered that defeat at @entity10 resounds through this club , whether it be a youth game or @entity197 final			1
substitute @entity74 tiptoed his way through the @entity10 defence , reaching the byline and calmly squaring for @entity76 to side - foot into the roof of the net			1
moments later , @entity76 galloped forward again , driving a swerving effort that brought a smart stop from @entity82			2
the tempo rose as @entity10 pushed on with greater urgency			2
a quick free - kick released @entity209 , who was thwarted by the sprawling frame of @entity66			1
@entity10 continued to press , swinging dangerous set - pieces but @entity9 continued to stand tall			1
this , as ever , was simply a game they were not prepared to lose .			0

@entity30 scored a low second - half free - kick to put @entity10 in front
@entity76 *slotted* home from close range to equalise soon after
new coach @entity222 took charge of his first @entity10 match at @entity225
