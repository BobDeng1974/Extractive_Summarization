corgis are an active and sociable breed			0
they love being where the action is and will play rough and tumble games with children			0
they make good companions for elderly people			0
the corgi learns quickly and as long as he knows what is expected of him he will oblige			0
however if left to his own devices he will get up to mischief - mainly chewing something			2
the corgi is a good house dog and will bark furiously at the door bell			2
