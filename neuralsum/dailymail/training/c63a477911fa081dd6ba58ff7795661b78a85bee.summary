plastic bank - notes will arrive in @entity1 within three years , ending 160 years of tradition			1
the @entity3 has this morning announced that the next £ 5 and £ 10 notes will be printed on polymer			1
since 1853 , bank - notes have been made from cotton paper but the @entity3 has carried out three years of research on switching to polymer notes			1
the new polymer notes will retain the familiar look of @entity3 banknotes , including the portrait of @entity24 and a historical character			1
the first polymer note will be the £ 5 note featuring sir @entity28 and will be issued in 2016			1
it will be followed around a year later by a polymer £ 10 note featuring @entity32			1
announcing the decision @entity34 , governor of the @entity3 , said : ' ensuring trust and confidence in money is at the heart of what central banks do			0
' polymer notes are the next step in the evolution of banknote design to meet that objective			2
' the quality of polymer notes is higher , they are more secure from counterfeiting , and they can be produced at lower cost to the taxpayer and the environment			2
' echoing the sentiment @entity54 , who leads on counterfeit currency for the @entity56 , welcomed the move			2
first up : the earliest plastic note to be issued will be the £ 5 , featuring @entity28 , in 2016 he said while no banknote is ever completely safe from counterfeiting , polymer notes will make life harder for those those trying to fake it			1
polymer notes allow for security features including transparent windows			2
criminals trying to replicate plastic banknotes will also face challenges copying the metallic strip on the notes			0
mr @entity54 , added : ' the @entity56 welcomes the introduction of polymer banks notes which represent a significant improvement over cotton based technologies , with improved options for countermeasures and intervention opportunities for law enforcement			1
' announcement : @entity3 governor @entity34 made a speech introducing the new breed of bank note in september , the @entity3 said it would initially look only at changing the £ 5 and £ 10 notes , with the first one being the new £ 5 featuring sir @entity28 in 2016			1
at the time , it promised to do nothing unless the public approved			0
if the feedback was overwhelmingly negative , the @entity3 promised to scrap the idea			0
but the response to that consultation was overwhelmingly supportive of polymer notes			2
over the course of two months , the @entity3 hosted events across the country to give the public the opportunity to learn more about polymer banknotes , to handle the notes , and to provide feedback			2
nearly 13,000 individuals gave their views during the public consultation programme , with 87per cent of those who responded , being in favour of polymer , and only six per cent were opposed with seven per cent remaining were neutral			0
the decision follows a three - year research programme by the bank looking at the materials on which banknotes are printed , and which concluded that there were compelling reasons to move to printing on polymer			1
the @entity3 's research found the plastic notes are resistant to dirt and moisture so stay cleaner for longer than the traditional paper notes			1
current bank - notes are made from ‘ cotton paper ’ , produced using tough , long - lasting cotton fibres rather than wood pulp			1
polymer bank - notes would be made from a transparent , flexible polypropylene film coated with layers of special ink , usually white			1
this would be cut into sheets , with notes printed using standard equipment			0
the notes are very difficult to tear at first , but will rip easily once they have a nick in them			0
more than 20 countries use polymer notes , none of them in @entity140			1
the @entity141 claims they last four times as long as paper notes			0
they can cope with going through a washing machine , but not being ironed at high temperatures			2
they start to ‘ shrink and melt ’ at @entity147 , the @entity3 ’s report found			0
the @entity3 has accepted notes in some form – originally hand - written – since its creation in 1694			2
the polymer bank - notes are secure and incorporate advanced security features making them harder to copy			1
and the notes are more durable , lasting at least 2.5 times longer than paper banknotes currently in circulation			0
as such the notes are more environmentally friendly , and because they last longer , over time they are cheater than paper notes			0
the switch is expected to save the bank more than £ 100million over a ten - year period			0
a typical £ 5 note currently lasts for just two years			1
the new ones would last for just under six years , according to its research published in the autumn			0
polymer notes are already used in more than 20 countries , including @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 as well as @entity176			1
they can also be recycled , a move which is likely to please the governor of the @entity3 @entity34 's wife @entity180 , a committed environmentalist			2
the mother - of - four is well known as a green activist with a pet hate of individually - wrapped tea bags and as an advocate of pencils which last a lifetime			0
the polymer notes could be recycled in different ways , from producing household energy to being used to create garden furniture and plant pots			2
the new notes will be smaller than those already in circulation and while cash machines will be largely unaffected , the cassettes which hold £ 5 notes will have to be changed			1
a spokesman for @entity200 , which operates the @entity1 cash machine network , said it is not known at this stage what the cost of adapting the country 's cash machines will be			1
ceo @entity208 welcomed the move to plastic , adding it proves ' cash still plays a vital role in our lives '			0
he said link will work closely with the @entity3 and the cash services industry to ensure a smooth transition to polymer notes , adding they will liase with counterparts in @entity176 and other countries where plastic notes are already in circulation			1
' we are always working hard to ensure the @entity1 ’s estate of @entity226 is fit for the 21st century and beyond , but this will also give our bank notes the chance to continue to play their part in the future , ' he said			2
' while the detailed planning is in the early stages and the full specification of the new notes has still has to be announced link understand that the changes required will involve at least modification of the cash cassettes to accommodate the new note size and in some cases at least , an engineer visit to each affected @entity226 to adjust various sensors			2
( @entity242 ) @entity243 , @entity34 , @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 , co-founder of the @entity247 , at the presentation of the concept design for the new @entity3 ten pound note , featuring @entity32 @entity251 notes : the new £ 5 and £ 10 notes which will be introduced in 2016 and will feature @entity28 and @entity32 respectively will be the first to be transferred to the plastic polymer ' experience from other countries suggests that in most cases @entity226 will be able to cope with new polymer note denominations ( £ 5s and in time £ 10s ) and older style paper denominations ( £ 20 notess ) at the same time however both paper and polymer of the same denomination are unlikely			1
' therefore once an individual machine has been swapped to polymer for that denomination then it will dispense them from that point onwards			0
' the @entity3 has said it understands the importance of notes in ‘ everyone ’s day - to - day lives ’ and has held meetings in shopping centres and focus groups to test opinion			0
consultation ended on november 15			0
the new notes would still feature the queen as well as a famous person , such as the naturalist @entity279			0
however , they would be slightly smaller than the cotton paper version			0
the current £ 5 note is 135mm by 70mm			1
if the switch to plastic goes ahead , the new one will be 125mm by 65mm			0
but they would continue ‘ the existing format of tiered - sizing ’ , that is , the higher the denomination , the bigger the note			0
for those who frequently forget to take cash out of their pockets before washing their clothes , a shift to plastic would be a big benefit			0
tests on the polymer notes in a 90 - degree cycle had only ‘ a minimal effect ’ but paper notes can be ‘ substantially degraded ’			1
the @entity3 also tested the polymer notes by submerging them in liquids , including red wine , and found they could be ‘ wiped clean ’			1
normal notes stain or disintegrate			0
in @entity176 , some users detected an aroma of maple on the plastic version , forcing the national bank to deny that any scent was added .			0

since 1853 , @entity1 's bank - notes have been made from cotton paper
@entity3 has carried out three years of research on switching to polymer notes
they can be wiped clean and survive a washing machine cycle at 90 degrees
polymer notes are already used in more than 20 countries
first polymer £ 5 note , featuring sir @entity28 , will be issued in 2016
in the fight against counterfeit notes @entity56 welcomes move
