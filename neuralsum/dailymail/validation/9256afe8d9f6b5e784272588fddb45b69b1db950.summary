@entity0 are the biggest club in @entity1 when it comes to crowds - both now and historically - and the joint biggest along with @entity4 when it comes to ‘ star players ’ in their line - ups , all - time			1
crowds and stars have been considered as part of a @entity13 study to explore which @entity15 clubs are the ‘ biggest ’ ; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study , having played in @entity1 ’s top division for at least a season			1
two different measurements were used for crowds - the average gates for each club this season , plus the biggest gate each club has ever had at any point			2
the aim of this was to gauge not just one season but reflect former ‘ greatness ’ for clubs now enduring leaner times but who were authentic giants at some point			0
@entity0 , averaging over 75,000 fans every game at @entity39 , top the crowds list this is what @entity42 looked like in 1934 , the year @entity41 recorded a record attendance of 84,569 @entity46 's @entity45 sees them second in attendances for this season , and fourth overall on crowds click here to see @entity13 's definitive list of the @entity54 clubs in @entity1 @entity0 ’s current average attendances of more than 75,000 leaves them way ahead of the field , with @entity46 in second place just below 60,000 , then @entity55 ( nearly 51,000 ) , @entity41 ( 45,400 ) , @entity4 ( 44,700 ) , with @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 filling out the top 10			1
all 59 clubs in the study have been ranked on current attendances , and separately on their biggest historic gates			0
an aggregate of those two ranks gives the overall crowd ranking topped by @entity0 , with @entity41 in second place , then @entity56 , @entity46 and @entity57			1
city have the highest single attendance for a home club match in @entity15 football - almost 85,000 were at @entity42 for the game in question , an @entity80 tie against @entity81 in 1934			2
@entity0 are the club with the next biggest home record , just over 83,000 for a league match with @entity46 in 1948			2
we ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull			0
then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates			0
their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs			0
incidentally , this was also played at @entity42 , which @entity0 were using at that time because @entity39 had been so damaged in the blitz			0
eight other clubs also have record home attendances of more than 70,000 : @entity56 , @entity58 , @entity104 , @entity57 , @entity59 , @entity105 , @entity46 and @entity106 and these all - time highs are reflective of these clubs having massive paying support in different eras			1
@entity112 's support may be loud and loyal , but they are bottom of our list in terms of crowds with @entity118 one of the @entity121 's smallest grounds , @entity112 rank low on attendance we counted the number of players from each club who have played for @entity1 , all - time , ranking the clubs by total			1
this reflects historic ‘ bigness ’			0
we then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the @entity133 — a measure of modern ‘ bigness ’			0
the overall ranking is an aggregate of these two			0
to measure the amount of ‘ star ’ players at each club , both all - time and more recently , our study used two objective criteria - the number of players capped by @entity1 at each club , ever , and the number of players called up by their countries for the most recent @entity133			1
the notion of ‘ stars ’ will always be subjective			0
but using proxies of @entity1 players over time and @entity133 players last summer allowed hard data to compare all the clubs on a like - for - like basis			1
the clubs have been ranked on each criteria with an aggregate ranking to determine the ‘ biggest ’ clubs in terms of all - time stars			2
using this method , @entity0 and @entity4 are joint top			1
@entity4 have provided the third most @entity1 players , all - time ( 67 ) , behind @entity104 in first place ( 73 ) and @entity59 ( 71 )			1
they also provided the joint third-most players of all the clubs in the @entity15 league to the @entity133 ( 10 )			0
@entity0 had the most players of any @entity15 team at the @entity133 , including @entity172 @entity4 were third for number of players at the @entity133 , including @entity175 and @entity176 @entity177 is the only @entity104 in the current @entity1 squad , but they top the historical list @entity0 provided the most players to the @entity133 of all @entity15 clubs ( 14 ) , followed by @entity56 ( 12 ) then @entity4 , @entity46 and @entity41 on 10 each			1
@entity0 have provided the fifth most @entity1 players , or 65 to date			2
thus both @entity4 and @entity0 ’s aggregate ‘ star player ’ rankings are the same			2
our ‘ star player ’ index has @entity46 and @entity59 in joint third , followed by @entity58 , @entity41 and @entity56 in joint fifth , then @entity104 in eighth , @entity55 in ninth , with @entity190 and @entity192 joint 10th			1
the full rankings are in the tables below .			0

@entity41 top the all - time top attendance list from a game in 1934
but @entity0 's average *2014/15* attendance sees them top our ' crowds ' *category*
@entity4 and @entity0 are joint first for most ' star players '
@entity59 and @entity46 follow in @entity1 caps and @entity133 stars
