picture the scene : you come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook - only to find a delicious meal worthy of a @entity6 - starred restaurant waiting for you			1
it sounds like a fantasy , but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by @entity13 scientists			1
they have come up with a set of robotic arms so sophisticated that they are capable of cooking meals from scratch			1
according to its creators , the arms can chop , stir , whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat , whether it is a simple home - cooked supper , or an elaborate concoction designed by a world - class chef			0
the hands move a little slowly , hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy , but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips			1
the device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose - built high - tech kitchen , priced at around £ 10,000 ( $ 14,000 ) , which includes an oven , hob , dishwasher and sink			1
engineers at the @entity25 spent almost 18 years developing the hands , which are each governed by 24 motors , 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors			1
working from a small workshop in @entity61 , @entity62 , they used to sell a few dozen devices a year , primarily to other scientists who used them for their own research			2
even @entity67 is understood to have ordered a pair to ‘ inspire ’ its engineers			0

the hands move a little slowly , hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy , but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips			2
but last year , after @entity91 engineer @entity90 from @entity92 approached the team with the notion of turning the hands into an everyday household gadget , the concept of the robot chef was born			2
kitchen revolution : a robot in the @entity100 prototype created by the @entity25 cooks a crab soup at the company 's booth at the world 's largest industrial technology fair , the @entity106 working away : the robotic hands are each governed by 24 motors , 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors even if there are a few splatters , it should n’t matter - the gadget will load the dishwasher and wipe down the work surfaces afterwards			1
the arms will tuck up out of the way when not in use , making space for their owners to get their own hands dirty			2
mr @entity90 , who is spearheading the project , said : ‘ all the things which are possible with the hand are possible here			0
the £ 10,000 ( $ 14,000 ) device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose - built high - tech kitchen which includes an oven , hob , dishwasher and sink bon appétit : chef @entity135 checks crab soup prepared by the ' robot chef ' at the @entity106 , in @entity138 earlier today ‘ a lot of people want to go to @entity6 - starred restaurants , but they are quite expensive and may be quite far from the home			1
this is an opportunity for people to enjoy very good food , and for a reasonable price			0
’ the only cuisine that is off the robot ’s menu at the moment is sushi , which requires exceedingly steady pressure and nimble fingers to make , but the team plan to conquer that as well by the time it goes on sale			0
by that point , they claim , users will be able to order meals from an @entity162 - style library of recipes devised by professional chefs , making it possible to tuck into @entity6 - standard food on a daily basis			0
people will also be able to train the robotic arms to cook their own favourite family recipes , by demonstrating them a few times while wearing high - tech gloves and wrist - bands			1
users will be able to ‘ order ’ dinner on their way home , or breakfast for when they wake up , using an app on their smartphone , picking recipes depending on the ingredients they have in stock			0
they will also be able to choose dishes based on their nutritional content			0
and just in case , the unit has emergency equipment if there ’s a fire .			0

@entity13 scientists invents robotic hands able to cook a meal from scratch
hands each governed by 24 motors , 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors
the £ 10,000 ( $ 14,000 ) kitchen device will be sold from as early as 2017
