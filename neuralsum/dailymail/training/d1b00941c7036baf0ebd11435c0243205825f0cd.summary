by @entity0 published : 01:14 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 8 january 2013 a new weight loss invention will let dieters eat anything they want - by sucking food and drink straight out of their stomachs			1
the rather gruesome - sounding system stops the body from digesting a third of each meal by pumping it out of the stomach via a tube inserted in the abdomen			1
so far it has been trialled on 24 obese patients and now the company @entity17 has applied for a patent on the unusual device in partnership with inventor @entity21			1
mr @entity21 is best known for inventing the @entity22 , the two - wheeled self - balancing personal transport			2
however , critics have been horrified by the system , which they say does n't tackle the causes of obesity			1
a tube , called the @entity53 , is placed in the stomach			2
the thin silicone rubber tube then connects the inside of the stomach to a poker - chip - sized @entity56 outside the abdomen			1
the port has a valve the user can open and close to control the flow of the stomach 's contents			2
the patient then empties a portion of their stomach contents about 20 minutes after each main meal through this tube by connecting a small , handheld device to the port			1
the emptying process itself is called aspiration and takes five to 10minutes to complete			0
the device would be used in combination with counseling and group support meetings to encourage healthier food choices			1
patients aspire after every main meal and then use it less often as they learn to eat more healthily			0
if problems are encountered the tube can be removed in a 15minute outpatient procedure			0
according to a statement from the company : ' the @entity91 works by reducing the calories absorbed by the body			1
after eating , food travels to the stomach immediately , where it is temporarily stored and the digestion process begins			1
' over the first hour after a meal , the stomach begins breaking down the food , and then passes the food on to the intestines , where calories are absorbed			2
' the @entity41 allows patients to remove about 30 per cent of the food from the stomach before the calories are absorbed into the body , causing weight loss			1
' however expert @entity106 , a trustee of the @entity107 , said he was dismayed by the new system			0
' i have n't seen anything as horrific as this before , ' he said			0
' you are supposed to eat and then digest , not pump your food out			0
' it seems they are trying to come up with a quick - fix for lazy people			1
it is far better to eat properly and in the correct amounts			0
' i understand that those who are obese need help , but we should be focusing on counseling and especially education			0
' the key is to teach children early about nutrition and a healthy diet			0
' the company claimed that patients lost an average of 49 per cent of their excess weight , equivalent to 45lbs , during the first year of using the system in a @entity134 clinical trial			1
however , the pump reportedly struggles when attempting to break up large foods			0
one patient even reported ' clogging ' and had to avoid cauliflower , broccoli , @entity141 food , stir fry , snow peas , pretzels , chips and steak			0
there have also been concerns that the system has a number of similarities to bulimia , where people make themselves sick after eating			0
however , the company said @entity41 does not cause eating disorders and there is little overlap between people with obesity and the psychological disorder			2
it added patients would be screened for the condition before being approved			0
according to the patent , the process of removing ingested food could potentially be improved by alternating the infusion of liquid into the stomach with the removal of material from the stomach			2
the company is also considering capturing stomach acid and returning it to the stomach to help break down food further , as well as adding nutritional supplements or medicines to the infused liquid			1
