secretary of state @entity0 admonished the anonymous @entity2 official who reportedly called @entity3 a ' chicken * * * t ' on thursday , saying the description of @entity7 prime minister reflects neither his nor the president 's opinion of the world leader			1
' we condemn anybody who uses language such as was used in this article , ' @entity0 said during an on - stage interview at the @entity16			2
' it is disgraceful , unacceptable , damaging , ' he added			0
@entity0 did not apologize on behalf of the @entity19 administration for the slur			1
rather , he claimed to have ' never heard that word around me in the @entity2 or anywhere			1
' but they make life much more difficult			0
' @entity0 then touted the president 's support for the @entity43 , and said it would n't have been possible without him , and pointed to @entity19 's statements supporting @entity7 's right to defend itself as evidence that there 's no hard feelings between @entity19 and his @entity7 counterpart			1
the cabinet official 's claims that he 's never heard any one at the @entity2 dis @entity53 follows a @entity55 report on tuesday that alleged that @entity0 is outside the president 's inner circle , and as such , his views do n't always reflect those of @entity60			1
' @entity2 officials joke that he is like the astronaut played by @entity63 in the movie gravity , somersaulting through space , untethered from the @entity2 , ' the @entity55 wrote			2
the characterization of @entity0 in the in - depth report allows for the possibility that an administration official did make unflattering statements about @entity3 , but @entity0 was n't privy to them			1
the unnamed @entity74 official 's reported description of @entity3 as a ' chicken * * * t ' , or worthless coward , drew a sharp response on wednesday from the @entity7 leader – no stranger to acrimony with the @entity19 administration – and a slam from @entity74 's @entity83 house speaker			1
the @entity74 broadside , in an interview in the @entity85 , followed a month of heated exchanges between the @entity3 government and @entity16 over settlement - building in @entity7 - annexed @entity90 , which @entity91 seek as the capital of a future state in the @entity94 and @entity95			1
the @entity2 soft - pedaled the insult as ' counterproductive ' but offered no apology on wednesday and did n't identify the official involved			1
' the thing about @entity3 is , he 's a chicken * * * t , ' the unidentified official was quoted as saying , using @entity3 's nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the @entity74 - educated former commando			1
' the good thing about @entity3 is that he 's scared to launch wars , ' the official said , alluding to past hints of possible @entity7 military action against @entity112 's nuclear program			1
' the bad thing about him is that he wo n't do anything to reach an accommodation with the @entity91 or with the @entity117			0
' @entity3 , the official was reported to have said , is interested only in ' protecting himself from political defeat ... he 's got no guts			2
' @entity7 leaders usually do not respond to comments by unidentified officials			0
but @entity3 addressed those remarks directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an @entity7 cabinet minister assassinated by a @entity91 in 2001			1
' i am not prepared to make concessions that will endanger our state , ' @entity3 said			0
' understand , our national interests , topped by security and the unity of @entity90 , are not what top the interests of those anonymous forces attacking us , and me personally			0
' ' i am under attack simply because i am defending the @entity7			0
if i did n't stand firm on our national interests , i would not be under attack			0
' otherwise occupied : @entity19 ducked mention of the controversy by spending his day focused on @entity142 – meeting with doctors and nurses in an orchestrated photo - op ' our supreme interests , chiefly the security and unity of @entity90 , are not the main concern of those anonymous officials who attack us and me personally , as the assault on me comes only because i defend the @entity7 , ' the @entity7 prime minister added			1
' despite all of the attacks i suffer , i will continue to defend our country			0
i will continue to defend the citizens of @entity7 , ' he said			2
such pledges by @entity3 have resonated among @entity7 voters , even amid fears his strained relations with @entity74 president @entity19 could ultimately weaken support from @entity7 's main diplomatic ally and arms provider			1
after @entity3 's speech , @entity167 , a spokesman for the @entity168 , dismissed the purported slur , denying that it reflected how the @entity19 administration felt about the @entity7 leader			1
' certainly that 's not the administration 's view , and we think such comments are inappropriate and counterproductive			2
' the same word – ' counterproductive – was on @entity2 press secretary @entity181 's crib sheet during a wednesday briefing with reporters			1
' those comments do not reflect the @entity74 ' position , and they do not reflect the personal views of the @entity187 , ' @entity181 said			0
' i am not aware of who made those comments ...			0
i am not aware if the president knows who made those comments			0
i 'd be surprised if he did			0
' confronted with harsh criticism from @entity196 , the speaker of the @entity197 , @entity181 called it ' a little rich to have a lecture about profanity from the @entity196			1
' referring to the epithet ' chicken * * * t , ' he claimed that @entity196 has ' reportedly said that about the majority leader of the @entity205 , ' democrat @entity206 of @entity207			2
@entity2 press secretary @entity181 said wednesday that the president does n't know who called the @entity7 prime minister a vulgar name , but that it was ' counterproductive ' the speaker had hours earlier called it a ' failure ' of @entity19 's leadership that ' disrespectful rhetoric ' has been ' used time and again by this administration with respect to the special relationship the @entity74 has with the state of @entity7			1
' ' when the president discusses @entity7 and @entity112 , it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is @entity74 ’s friend and who he thinks is @entity74 ’s enemy , ' @entity196 said in a statement			1
' @entity230 has no trouble drawing that distinction			0
' ' over the last several months , i have watched the administration insult ally after ally			0
i am tired of the administration ’s apology tour			0
the president sets the tone for his administration			0
he either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration , or he does not			1
' @entity196 's statement referred specifically to the use of vulgar language as a slam against a head of state , not the use of foul language in general			2
some @entity7 pundits predict an @entity7 election in 2015 , two years early , speculation seemingly supported by increasingly vocal challenges to @entity3 's policies from senior ministers to the left and right of him within the coalition government			1
economy minister @entity261 , whose ultranationalist @entity262 belongs to the coalition but who has had testy relations with @entity3 , defended him on wednesday			2
' the prime minister of israel is not a private person			2
he is the leader of the jewish state and the entire @entity262 people			0
cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult not just to him but to the millions of @entity7 citizens and @entity274 across the globe , ' he wrote on @entity276			1
@entity7 opposition leader @entity277 sounded a more critical note , telling @entity279 television : ' @entity3 is acting like a political pyromaniac , and he has brought our relations with the @entity74 to an unprecedented low			2
' in a series of recent speeches widely seen in @entity7 as setting the stage for a possible poll , @entity3 has highlighted growing security concerns in the wake of the july - august war with @entity291 in @entity95 and regional unrest that has brought @entity294 militants to @entity7 's northern border with @entity296			1
drawing @entity91 outrage and a @entity299 accusation that @entity7 was distancing peace , @entity3 pledged on monday to fast - track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in @entity7 - annexed @entity90			2
@entity3 described criticism as being ' detached from reality ' , saying @entity274 had a right to live anywhere in @entity90 , regarded by @entity7 as its united capital - a claim not internationally recognised			2
@entity167 , the @entity74 spokesman , acknowledged longstanding policy differences between @entity7 and @entity311 over settlements			0
' obviously , despite the extremely close relationship between the @entity74 and @entity7 , we do not agree on every issue , ' he said			0
' for instance we have repeatedly made clear the @entity74 ' longstanding view that settlement activity is illegitimate and complicates efforts to achieve a two - state solution			0
' despite these differences ' the @entity74 - @entity7 relationship remains as strong as ever ' , @entity167 added			0
most countries and the @entity324 deem the settlements @entity7 has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal			0
@entity7 disputes this , and has settled 500,000 @entity274 in @entity90 and the @entity94 , among 2.4 million @entity91 .			0

unnamed @entity19 administration official used the slur against @entity7 's prime minister
@entity2 called the line ' counterproductive ' but offered no apology
@entity0 said such language does ' not reflect the president , it does not reflect me ' and claimed to have ' never heard that word ' used at the @entity2
house speaker @entity196 ripped @entity19 , saying ' he either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration , or he does not '
@entity3 said ' the assault on me comes only because i defend the @entity7 '
