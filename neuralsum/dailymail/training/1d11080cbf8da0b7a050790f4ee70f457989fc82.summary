@entity1 owner @entity0 has offered to give the club away for nothing if his last - ditch bid to rebrand their traditional identity fails			1
during a 45 - minute briefing at the @entity7 , arranged of his own volition to make plain his future intentions , the 75 - year - old also pledged to deliver @entity13 qualification if his appeal to the @entity15 is successful			2
since saving @entity1 from a financial abyss in november 2010 , the @entity17 - born , locally raised businessman has ploughed £ 72million of his personal wealth into transforming them from a mid-ranking @entity22 team into @entity24 finalists and @entity26 participants			1
‘ i ’m out means i ’m out			0
i will give it away if the appeal fails and no buyer is found			2
my message is that if you do n’t like @entity1 i go , ’ @entity0 confirmed			1
when the @entity0 family took over four years ago , the strategic plan included playing top - flight football this season , a feat that was achieved 12 months ahead of schedule			2
@entity0 ’s legal team are understood to have been working on the @entity15 appeal over the summer and it is expected to take up to three months to reach its conclusion			1
but i wanted to be here until i achieved my ambition of being in the top four			0
you will say that it ’s a bit wide , a bit exaggerating , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ no , because if i told you three years ago there would be @entity58 and @entity24 final , and all this , you would have thought it was a joke			0
now i am saying i want to be top four			0
in a couple of years ’ time you will find it ’s not a joke , it ’s a possibility — if i am still here			0
’ @entity0 ’s frustration over the restriction on @entity1 ’s global branding — he revealed that the club ’s current shirt sponsorship with @entity71 is £ 1m a year less than had been agreed with another unnamed @entity73 company before april ’s @entity24 ruling kiboshed it — follows failure to secure the freehold for the ground from @entity78 , blocking plans to build a hotel and house other commercial facilities on site			1
‘ there is a difference between @entity22 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity58 , ’ @entity0 said			0
@entity1 is for sale and has been for five months after @entity0 announced the rumours were true the name change was turned down on april 9 and @entity0 put the club up for sale 24 hours later ‘ championship and below you are a local club			1
gate receipts represent 60 per cent of total income			0
when you are @entity58 you are no longer local , you are global			0
‘ so you act global , you do n’t act local			0
at the moment , because we have no other income , i pay , as evidence of my commitment to the local community , but there is a limit and i have gone past that limit			0
‘ we stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote @entity1 as a brand name and playing name be blocked			1
‘ as a consequence of the @entity24 ’s decision on april 9 , i announced , on april 10 that @entity1 is for sale			1
i am using the wording @entity1 now to show respect to the @entity24 ’s decision			1
this is in accordance with my decision 10 months ago that i would walk away within 24 hours			1
@entity0 says @entity118 can have no sway over his decision because there 's nothing to decide @entity1 was put up for sale less than 24 hours after the name @entity1 was denied ‘ in actual fact it was 22 hours			1
when i say something i mean it			0
i do n’t call bluffs			0
we have also begun the appeal against the @entity24 decision via arbitration and we are hopeful of a positive outcome or that the @entity24 reconsider their decision			1
‘ until the conclusion of the appeal or the sale , whichever comes first , we will remain fully committed to the club , evidenced by the latest remarkable additions to our already very good team			2
’ @entity0 was referring to @entity1 ’s £ 38.5m outlay on signings since the end of last season , including the record £ 10m recruitment of @entity150 ’s @entity149 striker @entity148 , who could make his debut against @entity153 next monday .			2

the @entity155 blocked name change to @entity1 on april 9 and owner @entity0 put club up for sale less than 24 hours later
@entity0 confirms he has been looking for a buyer for more than five months
the @entity163 has appealed the @entity24 's decision to the @entity15 , and @entity0 repeated : ' appeal or the sale , whichever comes first '
if appeal does not get *overturned* by @entity15 and @entity170 can not find a buyer , the owner says : ' i will give it away . out means i *'m* out '
@entity170 *insists* he would rather change the name and stay owner of the club
