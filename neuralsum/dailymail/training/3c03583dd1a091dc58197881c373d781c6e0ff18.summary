an intrepid pilot almost became hypothermic during an 8,000 - mile solo flight in a 1940s biplane			2
the severe @entity4 winter weather proved a challenge for @entity6 during her eight - week adventure from @entity8 to @entity9			2

daredevil : s @entity18 set off from @entity8 in the spirit of @entity31 , a classic 1940s open cockpit @entity22 biplane she said : ' i came in , in the atrocious weather with gusts of over 30 knots			1
thank goodness it 's on the coast because i could n't see @entity9 until i was over it			2
' weather is always the biggest issue			0
getting back across @entity4 in an open cockpit plane battling strong headwinds and crosswinds , i lose 30 % of my ground speed			2
' ms @entity18 , who has been flying for more than 30 years and was 16 years old the first time she flew a plane , passed through some of the most troubled and beautiful parts of the world			1
@entity53 of @entity31 has a top speed of 95mph and a maximum altitude of 10,000ft , although ms @entity18 flew at low levels , including as low as 15ft over @entity58 , @entity59 , allowing her to enjoy @entity17 's wildlife and dramatic terrain			1
adventurous : ms @entity18 has been flying for more than 30 years and flew a plane when she was 16 she said one of her worst journeys was over @entity66 where she was asked to fly at 10,000ft and she became worried she would not make her destination as she was almost going backwards			1
she said : ' it was getting colder , the plane was getting slower and i was almost running out of fuel , but they would not let me descend			0
' i was really anxious and i became almost hypothermic			0
in the end i did n't do what they told me because it was too dangerous			0
@entity6 with her 1942 @entity22 biplane at @entity78 near @entity79 the 40 - leg trip also saw ms @entity18 fly through @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and the @entity87 ' when i flew over the @entity88 i got told to ascend to 16,000ft which was impossible because the plane is not made to fly that high and i would have needed oxygen above 10,000ft			1
i was treated like a commercial airliner			0
' the 40 - leg trip also saw ms @entity18 fly through @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and the @entity87			1
in @entity66 , she was delayed by a storm with winds of more than 70mph that delivered snow to @entity97 had hoped to finish the journey before @entity99 but the strong winds across @entity4 meant that she was stuck in @entity101 over the festive period waiting for a window of opportunity			0
the spirit of @entity31 has a top speed of 95mph and a maximum altitude of 10,000ft beauty : @entity6 's 1942 @entity22 biplane at @entity78 near @entity79 she said she was very happy and relieved to get the spirit of @entity31 back to the @entity109 in one piece			2
she said : ' having lived the project so intensively , i never quite imagined the finale			0
