they 've been branded ' high class prozzies ' , ' call girls ' and ' pathetic sex workers ’			2
but what really makes an intelligent young woman , who has had every chance in life , use a sugar daddy dating service to meet an older man			1
one who did sign up to a sugar daddy website is @entity13 , 22 , from @entity14 , an advertising student studying at a university in the north of @entity17			1
the @entity19 website where @entity13 met her sugar daddy far from being ashamed of her activities , @entity13 , who is using a false name but has provided real pictures , says people should n't be so quick to judge			1
' a site like this just felt more honest , ' she explains			1
' it asks you about your desired arrangement and obviously you do n’t get to ask things that you would on a regular site			1
‘ i get to say that that i want someone successful and powerful and who i find attractive and while that might sound arrogant on a normal site , in reality , it ’s what most women want ’			1
it took a few months of exchanging messages with different men online until @entity13 met someone that she wanted to meet up with in person			1
the man she would eventually strike up a relationship with was a multi-millionaire but , at 44 , he was also twice her age			1
@entity13 refers to her interactions with this man as ‘ an arrangement , ’ and she freely admits that despite dating him for six months , she was never in love with him			1
during this time , her ‘ sugar daddy ’ gave her weekly cash payments and showered her with designer presents			1
' i got a weekly amount but mainly it was gifts and shopping and things that we would do and buy together , ' she explains			2
' he bought me @entity69 , @entity71 shoes , dresses and jewellery - he kitted me out			1
he gave me everything down to workout clothes , an @entity76 , a new phone , speakers for my room , bed sheets , trainers and everything			2
‘ i have always been someone who likes going to nice places , wearing nice clothes and shoes and bags - having access to all of that is very much my cup of tea			1
’ @entity13 is reluctant to reveal how much the weekly cash amount was , but admits that it totalled roughly £ 5,000 over the six month period			1
on top of her clothes and weekly payments , he splashed out £ 1,500 on a fancy party for @entity13 ’s 21st birthday			2
' he paid for me to have a £ 1,500 birthday party with cocktail and cakes and champagne , ' she explains			0
‘ i have never been treated like that before and i could n’t get my head around the fact that he did n’t even want to be there			0
‘ he did n’t ask for me to do something in return , he just cared for me and wanted for me to have a nice birthday party			0
’ although the pros in @entity13 ’s arrangement are clear , she admits that a lot is also required of her in order to be given these financial rewards			0
‘ discretion is expected of me , because these guys do understand that there is a bit of a taboo around doing this			0
‘ i am also expected to look good , if i turned up in baggy jeans they ’d ask what i was doing			0
also , you should not infringe too much on their time , although often i feel like they are the more clingy ones			0
seeking arrangement is a dating site that links rich older men with young beautiful women			1
it was founded by @entity140 businessman @entity139 ( pictured with his wife @entity141 ‘ i met a guy once and we were in his @entity144 and he took a call from @entity146 and i could n’t really say to him , " can you not do that ? " ‘ you are basically trying to be a bit more on your best behaviour			0
’ @entity13 claims that she did n’t sleep with her ‘ sugar daddy ’ during the six months that they were together , because she was n’t ready			1
but she does admit that they went further than any platonic friends ever would			0
' he wanted more but i was n’t ready , ’ she explains			0
when asked if they kissed and how ask far they did go , she replied : ' yes , we kissed			0
it was like we were in the early stages of a relationship			0
’ although @entity13 clearly enjoys the finer things in life , she says that the money is just one part of dating an older , rich man			2
' i usually fancy men who are slightly older than me , ' she explains			0
‘ with guys in my year , it ’s a different kind of attraction - guys at university are hot , but if you try and have a conversation with them , it ’s different			1
‘ men have a different offering - intellect , wisdom and awareness of themselves and of me			2
‘ also , it has opened my eyes to what is happening in this country - i had no idea of all the things that were on offer			2
‘ i guess it blurs the class lines - people think we ’re worlds apart from millionaires but nothing could be further from the truth			2
’ @entity13 eventually broke up with her sugar daddy after the strain of being in a long distance relationship became too much and is now back on the site looking for another arrangement			1
and while she freely admits that she is charging for her company , she is adamant that her behaviour is nothing like prostitution			0
‘ these are guys just looking for relationships , i have never referred to anyone as a sugar daddy and @entity208 forbid should i be called a sugar baby			1
‘ but you have to put a label on something - these men saying " i ’ve got all of this money but i do n’t know where to meet these girls "			2
they do n’t move in circles where they would fall into these situations , so it ’s just a platform			0
' anyway , some people would argue that a relationship and an arrangement are interchangeable			0
it is the link with prostitution that has been formed that is the problem			0
‘ one has more beauty , one has more money and it ’s just a platform for people with different offerings , whereas prostitution is a service or a product , something to be bought			0
‘ people are always going to make trade - offs in relationships and we ’ve all got different things to offer			2
‘ people are always going to be getting the most for what they can , that ’s just society ’ .			0
