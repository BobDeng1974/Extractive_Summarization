by @entity0 the ‘ comet of the century ’ , @entity8 , is now visible to the naked eye - but catch it while you can , as some experts believe it wo n't be there for long			1
there have been reported sighting of ' wings ' coming from the comet , which may suggest that its centre has already broken up			1
however , @entity14 , blogging on @entity17 's @entity16 , believes there are other possibilities			0
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths he claims the wings could be due to dust emissions or tail structures caused by @entity8 running into high solar winds			1
' if the comet has fragmented , we should see some dramatic changes in the next few days , ' he added			1
' typically we expect a large increase in brightness followed then by a dramatic decrease in the comet 's brightness in these situations			1
' on saturday , the comet was declared as being in ' full outburst mode ' after having increased in brightness by a magnitude of two in just 24 hours			1
this image was taken in the early hours of this morning just before sunrise above the skies of in northern @entity54			2
the ball of ice and dust is thought to originate from the @entity59 cloud and is the first sungrazing comet in 200 years @entity8 was spotted in the early hours of this morning two hours before sunrise above the skies of in northern @entity54 , and a faint tail can can seen against the clear sky near @entity64 , @entity65 a flood of images have come in from amateur astronomers , many of whom took images in their back garden with just binoculars or small telescopes			1
scientists are now predicting it will get even brighter over the next few weeks , and are encouraging people to get a glimpse of @entity8 themselves			1
the best place to see the ‘ comet of the century ’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed , such as in the countryside			2
while it can be seen with the naked eye , binoculars will highlight details such as its tail , streamers and bumps in the surface			2
the comet is currently close enough to the sun which means tomorrow , it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon			2
@entity8 , which has been dubbed the ' comet of the century ' , was visible to the naked eye in november by the end of the november , it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky			1
on 28th of november , @entity8 will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface before skirting around to where it came			1
the comet is already creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail			1
the comet was discovered in september last year by two amateur astronomers using @entity115 's @entity114 , @entity8 , who marvelled at how bright it was even beyond @entity118 's orbit			1
at the end of this month , it will be more than 100 times closer to the sun than the @entity123 comet , one of the brightest of the last century which was visible with the naked eye for a record 18 months , passed at its peak in 1997			2
@entity8 is named after the @entity114 , used by a pair of @entity115 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as c / 2012 @entity132 the comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail @entity8 can already be seen with the naked eye but is predicted to get even brighter over the next few weeks			1

the comet is currently close enough to the sun that , tomorrow , it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon			0

on 28th of november , @entity8 will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface before skirting around to where it came			1
as it blasts towards the sun , the intense gravitational pull will make it speed up to 234 miles per second			0
the sun 's rays will also heat the ball of ice , metal and rock to 2,760 degrees @entity173 , making it much brighter than most comets - with some scientists claiming it could outshine the moon			0
some have warned that the intense pressure on the comet could simply blast it apart , as the heat melts not just the ice but also rock and metal			0
a flood of images from both professional and amateur astronomers have been coming in			1
it is expected to be visible to the naked eye in early mornings throughout december and during the night in january			0
it is currently passing through the @entity193 in the east of the morning sky			0
comets are believed to be frozen remains left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago			0
@entity8 , which has never visited our inner solar system before , has emerged from the @entity202 , a reservoir of icy bodies beyond @entity206 's orbit			1
these balls of ice are occasionally ' bumped ' by the sun 's gravity out of the cloud and into a flight path that brings them into the inner solar system			0
the vast majority of comets are invisible to the naked eye , but the most famous is @entity218			0
an image of @entity8 's full extent , with an imprint showing the area of the above @entity224 image			2
some scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to weather the sun 's heat that is because it is the only comet which visits often enough and shines brightly enough to be seen by most people in their lifetime			0
it comes to our inner solar system between every 75 and 76 years and last visited in 1986			0
among other things , it inspired the name of 1950s rock and roll outfit @entity241			0
there is still a chance the comet will not survive its journey close to the sun , but if it does , @entity247 could learn a lot about the comet 's composition by observing which gases boil off it as it nears the sun some scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to weather the sun 's heat			0
cosmic show : @entity8 , which is heading to within 600,000 miles of our sun on november 28			2

sighting of ' wings ' coming from the comet may suggest it is breaking up
if it has fragmented , there will be a dramatic increase in its brightness
@entity8 grew in brightness by a magnitude of 2 in just 24 hours on saturday
a flood of images have come in from amateur astronomers , many of whom used binoculars or small telescopes to watch the spectacle
