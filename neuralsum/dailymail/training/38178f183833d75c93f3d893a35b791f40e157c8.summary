@entity2 might have been forgiven for being slightly rusty having not picked up a club for almost three decades			2
but the 51 - year - old bagged the unbelievable one - in - a - million feat in just 30 minutes during two separate rounds at @entity4			1
mr @entity2 ' achievement was even more incredible given that he only took up the sport again - after a long absence - two months ago			1
the it systems architect shot his first ace at about 9am on the 13th hole of the course in @entity22 , @entity5 , while playing with his friends			2
and an even louder cheer erupted when @entity2 sank his second hole - in - one just half an hour later while playing a different round with his wife , @entity27			2
mr @entity2 , a stepfather - of - three from @entity29 , @entity5 , said : ' the first one landed in the hole with an enormous clatter and people were soon shouting and hollering			1
' i saw the second one bounce on to the green before it went out of sight and when i walked up to the hole it was in the cup			0
' my wife was so excited because she 's never seen someone get a hole - in - one before			0
' @entity2 , a former @entity42 international youth amateur , gave up golf in the mid- 1980s to concentrate on his university degree and career			1

@entity61 , from bookmakers @entity62 , said @entity2 ' feat has odds of more than one million to one			1
