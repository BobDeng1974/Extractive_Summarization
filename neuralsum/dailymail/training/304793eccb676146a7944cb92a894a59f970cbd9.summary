the positive impact a parent can have on a child ’s education is more important than where they live , a new study suggests			1
growing up in an impoverished area is often blamed for holding back children academically			0
but a report ’s findings indicate it is the attitude towards education within their family unit that really matters			1
the research involved two groups of disadvantaged children in cities across @entity21 , all of whom were waiting to move into social housing in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods			0
the positive impact a parent can have on a child ¿ s education is more important than where they live , a new study suggests one group moved in between one and three years before their @entity32 tests at 14			1
the other started living there afterwards			0
when their performance in the tests was measured , both groups had almost identical average scores			0
dr @entity39 , who conducted the research , said : ‘ we have always tried to help the most disadvantaged children to get better life chances and one of the ways we thought we could do this is through housing policy			0
‘ but research now increasingly tells us that bad neighbourhood environments have no causal influence on these children ’s school performances at all			1
’ the postdoctoral fellow in the @entity53 added : ‘ these two groups of students really get very bad grades - very similar to students who live in high - density social housing neighbourhoods and never moved			1
‘ this means that we definitely should think about ways to help them improve their school achievements but we can not do it through housing policy			1
’ a report ¿ s findings indicate it is the attitude towards education within their family unit that really matters the paper - neighbourhood quality and student performance - considered whether living in a ‘ bad neighbourhood ’ could lead to a ‘ locking - in of the disadvantaged into a poverty trap ’			1
a total of 2,094 children were followed			0
all were waiting to move with their families into neighbourhoods with at least 80 per cent of social tenants			0
the study will be of particular interest to education secretary @entity81 , who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015 these areas are characterised by ‘ very high unemployment and extremely low qualification rates , high building density , rooms over-crowding and low house prices ’ , the report said			1
the people who live there are ‘ more likely to be depressed , unemployed , cigarette smokers [ and ] obese ’			0
dr @entity39 used the average performance in the three core subjects - @entity97 , maths and science - and combined them to create an overall score with a maximum of 100			0
the group that moved into the impoverished areas before their @entity32 exam scored an average of 33			0
those that moved in later managed just 33.6			0
the data took into account variables such as ‘ negative shocks ’ that leave better - off families suddenly in need of social housing and other factors including ethnicity , free school meal status and previous test scores			2
dr @entity39 concluded : ‘ the main finding of this study is that early movers into deprived social housing neighbourhoods experience no negative effects on their school attainment relative to late movers			1
’ the paper is due to be presented today at the @entity130 ’s annual conference in @entity131			2
it is complemented by another study at the conference which links an increase in the minimum school leaving age with improved academic performance in the next generation			1
the children of parents who spend one extra year in education typically achieve one grade higher in two gcses or two grades higher in one gcse than other pupils , it found			2
the research was based on the children of 19,966 people affected by the 1972 reform of the school leaving age from 15 to 16			2
it will be of particular interest to education secretary @entity81 , who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015			2
previous research has found those who remain in education of training until 18 earn more money , are healthier and are less likely to break the law			2
professor @entity164 , director of the @entity165 at @entity166 , said : ‘ the research shows that where somebody lives is much less important than what they carry around with them			0
‘ this includes what their interests are , how much support they get from their parents and how much their parents care about good education - which they can provide directly to their child and by finding them a good school to go to			1

@entity53 study into school attainment is released today
the report shows that a family *'s* attitude to education is *key* to *success*
