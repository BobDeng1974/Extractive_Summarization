by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:44 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:45 est , 22 december 2013 forensic scientists in @entity4 are embarking on a huge project to identify the remains of 500 children who were taken by guerrilla fighters and later found in mass unmarked graves			1
their investigations have identified one girl through her bones as the victim of a bombing , after she had been missing for more than a decade after being taken by leftist rebels from her home aged 14			1
it comes more than 10 years after she was taken and died at a camp run by the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , the main guerrilla group in @entity4 that has recruited child fighters			1
identifying : a worker at @entity4 's @entity23 organises the remains of a young woman recruited by a guerrilla group huge effort : the institute has now begun a big project to identify the remains of children from mass graves project : around six forensic experts are using the latest technology to compare dna profiles obtained from remains of around 500 victims with samples from possible relatives forensic analysis was carried out by @entity4 's @entity23 at the request of her family , who believed the @entity19 had taken her and she could have been among the dead			1
@entity46 , the institute ’s deputy director , said : ‘ we have a slogan : life took them from us and death brings them back to us			0
’ the institute has now begun a project to identify the remains of children from mass graves , with more than 17,000 children having gone missing during @entity60 's longest - running insurgency			2
around six forensic experts are using the latest technology to compare dna profiles obtained from remains of around 500 victims with samples from possible relatives			1
difficult task : complicating the project , there is no national database of genetic information in @entity67 scientific : experts say identifying remains through dna is far more difficult than tv shows make it seem , particularly in @entity4 , where acidic soil and a hot and humid climate speed up the deterioration of the bones tricky job : children have a lower concentration of the minerals that protect bones than adults , which leaves them more vulnerable to decomposition in one case , a girl was conscripted by the far - right @entity86 ( @entity86 ) paramilitary group and murdered in 2003 , according to testimony from an demobilised fighter			1
' we have a slogan : life took them from us and death brings them back to us ' @entity46 , deputy director of @entity4 's @entity23 her remains , partially decomposed after eight years in a grave , are resting on the table of anthropologist @entity100 , of the institute 's laboratory in the central @entity4 city of @entity104			2
‘ she was executed between august and october 2003 by members of the @entity86 with a shot to the head , ’ and she was ‘ dismembered to hide the evidence , ’ explained ms @entity105 , while holding the destroyed skull of the young girl in her gloved hands			0
a sample was taken from one of the bones to compare the dna with that of her paternal grandmother			0
horror : more than 17,000 children having gone missing during @entity60 's longest - running insurgency tragic : children were often taken from his or her village by armed groups , and their families did n't see them again until they appeared years later in mass graves or unmarked graves in cemeteries in most of the cases ms @entity105 has worked on , she said , the child was taken from his or her village by armed groups , and their families did n't see them again until they appeared years later in mass graves or unmarked graves in cemeteries			2
the experts in @entity104 emphasise that identifying remains through dna is far more difficult than tv shows make it seem , particularly in @entity4 , where acidic soil and a hot and humid climate speed up the deterioration of the bones			0
children also have a lower concentration of the minerals that protect bones than adults , which leaves them more vulnerable to decomposition			0
further complicating the project , there is no national database of genetic information .			0
