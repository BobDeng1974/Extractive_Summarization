a picture posing with a @entity1 in front of the snowy peak of the @entity4 must top the list for the ultimate @entity7 souvenir			1
but that iconic photo opportunity has been consigned to history after a @entity7 town bans selfies with the giant rescue dogs			1
@entity15 in the @entity14 area of @entity7 has imposed the ban after a report from an animal welfare charity alleged the dogs were kept in ' miserable conditions '			1
the organisation has carried out investigations into the conditions the dogs were being kept since 2012 and published a report earlier this year			2
the report said said when they were not being taken out on excursions with tourists , the dogs were being kept locked up in confined conditions in an unheated condemned building for long periods of time			1
it claimed the dogs are left without food or water in foul smelling conditions and are not given enough exercise			0
when they are put on show , the dogs are kept in the cold for long periods of time and quickly grow tired while posing for photographs , sometimes with children riding on their backs			2
the organisation has been calling for the town council of @entity15 to ban the use of the dogs for many years			2
in a statement , @entity61 said the town 's decision showed it ' loves the animals '			0
@entity15 , under the shadow of the @entity4 is a popular tourist desitnations it said : ' @entity61 rejoices that the town of @entity15 has now taken action to ban taking pictures of @entity1 dogs in its territory			1
' @entity75 has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props			0
' for several years , the @entity61 , and its section working in the @entity14 have criticised the conditions in which these animals are kept , and time and time again , has complained about those who keep the animals in captivity , for their violation of laws on the protection of animals			0
' the @entity61 will continue to do all its can to make sure these dogs , which at the moment are housed in a condemned building in miserable conditions flout animal protection rules , are kept in comfortable conditions that meet their needs			1
' the @entity101 is offering its help on the condition those holding the owners decided to put these dogs in better accommodation after they have been used purely as objects for hire			0
' the mayor of the town , @entity110 , told @entity7 radio station @entity112 : ' no @entity1 dogs will be used for photo shoots with tourists on the peaks of @entity117 and @entity118			1
' we have been able to convince providers that it is not right to continue to offer pictures in that way			0
' he said over the summer a few dogs might be found because of long - term contracts with tour operators but the practice will be stamped out by next winter			0
in march the association filed a legal complaint against the @entity1 owners , claiming that the dogs ’ living and working conditions were abusive			2
