grandparents who took over raising their grandchild when she was aged four after discovering she had been subjected to horrific abuse have shared their story			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , from @entity6 , who are in their fifties , took in their granddaughter , @entity9 , ( all names changed to protect the child 's identity ) after she was born into a violent relationship			1
the couple explained how they knew @entity9 's mother @entity17 - their daughter - was a victim of domestic abuse but their attempts to get her to leave her violent partner always failed			1
@entity9 , now nine , ( not pictured to protect her identity , file photo shown ) was neglected and abused during her first four years before going to live with her grandparents @entity5 explained : ' @entity9 's mother @entity17 suffered from domestic violence when she was pregnant with @entity9 and would come and stay with us after each assault			1
sometimes we 'd have to take her to hospital because she 'd be bleeding so much			0
' from the moment @entity9 was born , @entity17 was emotionless , it was clear to us that she was having difficulties being a mum			1
@entity17 would scream and shout if @entity9 cried and refused to take @entity9 out in a pram for a walk			1
she never hit @entity9 , but she would hit herself because she was upset			2
' when @entity9 was six - weeks - old @entity17 went back to live with her partner again			1
we worried about @entity9 all the time because we 'd seen the first six weeks and thought that @entity17 needed support being a new mum			2
' the following months and years @entity17 and her partner continued to fall out and fight and @entity17 would come back and stay with us with @entity9 but she always went back to him			1
' however , the couple admitted they did n't know quite how bad things had got in @entity17 's home until @entity9 finally went to live with them full - time when she was four			1
@entity5 said : ' @entity9 was so timid and scared			1
she had dog bite marks on the backs of her legs but @entity17 could n't explain any of this			0
we had logged our concerns repeatedly with @entity51 but little was done to protect @entity9			2
' they were shocked by how little @entity9 had been taught and how she was constantly frightened and confused			1
@entity5 said : ' @entity17 and her partner had never spent any time trying to teach @entity9 things or helping her learn			1
when @entity9 came to live with us she could n't speak very well or use a knife and fork			1
what language she had was littered with swear words			0
she would n't go outside in the garden to play because she 'd never been allowed to play out before			0
' she would follow us around the house and did n't like being away from us			0
when we took her to places she did n't know she would vomit or wet herself with stress			0
' @entity9 had been shouted at every day			2
she had seen self - harm every day			1
she had seen animals beaten and killed			0
' as if this was n't shocking enough , the grandparents then learnt from @entity9 that she had been sexually abused			1
' we found out that she regularly saw people having sex and then we discovered she had been sexually abused , ' @entity5 said			1
' we allowed @entity9 to visit her mum to go on holiday when she was four years old			2
when she came back she described an incident which had happened on holiday with a family friend which we realised was a sexual assault			0
her abuser was a teenager , approximately 17 at the time			0
' he admitted it to the family , but they did n't take it seriously			0
he was told not to do it again and that was it			0
we later found out that there had been multiple assaults over a period of time			0
' @entity4 added : ' after disclosing the abuse @entity9 had trouble sleeping , would have nightmares and became quite scared			1
she was like a newborn baby and refused to be left alone			0
when i was cooking she was clinging to my leg			0
i could n't go to the toilet or shower alone			0
she did n't like sleeping alone and would share a bed with me or sleep on a camp bed in our room rather than be on her own			0
' she found certain toys really scary to play with and would n't watch her old favourite programmes			0
she did n't understand what had happened but she knew it had scared her			0
' @entity9 became really secretive about her body and would n't let us wash her or clean her			1
i overheard her playing with her dolls one day where one doll was saying to the other " open your legs i 'm not going to hurt you			0
" little by little she was describing the horrific things she 'd been subjected to			0
' the grandparents said it has been a long and difficult road to recovery to help the little girl put her past behind her			0
the @entity130 's ' letting the @entity123 ' programme helps young victims of sexual abuse deal with their pasts and move on with their lives so they can reclaim a happy childhood ( pictured posed by model ) now aged nine , the grandparents said @entity9 's confidence and happiness has gradually improved after numerous courses they were referred to by @entity51			1
but they said the real breakthough came after they sought help from children 's charity @entity130 and their ' letting the @entity123 ' programme which supports the young victims of sexual abuse and their families			1
@entity4 said : ' the @entity130 was the first organisation that took a combined approach to dealing with @entity9 's sexual abuse and did the work with us and @entity9 in the same building but in different rooms			1
it 's exactly what we needed			0
' thanks to the programme , the couple said they have seen a remarkable change in @entity9 's character and confidence			2
' she 's finally making friends and living a normal childhood , ' said @entity4			1
' she 's joined a local @entity157 group and is enjoying herself			0
she 's doing things we could n't even comprehend this time last year			2
the turnaround has been amazing			0
' we 've broken through to @entity9 now and unlocked the little girl she was meant to be			2
she still has the memories of the abuse and neglect , but now we 're replacing them with happy memories			2
' @entity130 practitioner @entity167 , who worked with @entity9 , agreed that the little girl has transformed for the better in recent months			1
she said : ' when i first started working with @entity9 she would n't give me any eye contact , she was constantly looking to her grandma for reassurance			2
when i first met her she did n't know how to laugh , she was permanently scowling , fearful and nervous			0
when we were playing in the play room , she did n't want to play with me , she wanted to play by herself			0
' @entity9 was n't showing behaviour that was appropriate to her age ; she was acting a lot younger than she was			1
a lot of her behaviour was like that of a pre-school child , both emotionally and how she was reacting to things			0
@entity9 was unable to make or maintain friendships at school and was very reliant on the adults around her			2
' i think the breakthrough came when had some joint sessions with @entity5 and @entity4 together with @entity9			1
@entity9 wanted to play in the sand tray with some figures			2
she told a story through the figures about her old family who were dangerous and negative and her new family who were loving and safe			0
through her play she showed that she was defending herself from her old family and protecting herself with her new family			0
' another time she had figures acting as her and her mum and played out a conversation between them where @entity9 asked her mum to apologise for what had happened to her and she did			2
she then joined her figure to @entity4 and @entity5 and her new family and they had a party			1
' since doing the letting the @entity123 programme @entity9 's social behaviour has become a lot more age appropriate , and although she still needs some adult support in lessons , she 's understanding and learning a lot more than she has done in the past			1
she 's grown up and feels ready to play with children her own age and have fun			2
now she laughs and is a happy child			2
' text future to 78866 to donate Â£ 3 to help the @entity130 be there for children like @entity9 who have been abused , providing therapy and support to help them take their first steps on the road to recovery			1
