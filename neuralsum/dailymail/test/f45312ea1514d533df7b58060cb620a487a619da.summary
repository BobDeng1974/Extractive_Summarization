an exotic animal owner from @entity1 is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in january			1
in total , six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger ( part lion , part tiger ) were taken from @entity17 's @entity16 farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were ' unsafe '			1
authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern @entity1 released 56 exotic animals - including lions and tigers - then killed himself			1
apparently @entity17 has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72 - year - old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure , backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie does n't pose a threat			1
some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting , hoping the animals will return			2
' he 's lost without them , ' said @entity52 , who lives four houses away			1
' a lot of us are lost without them			2
' @entity17 allowed anyone to visit at no charge , getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash , as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals			1
he thought of himself as an educator , inviting scout troops and families to learn what they would n't hear at zoos			2
flashback : in total six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger were taken from @entity17 's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear however , the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed @entity1 to tighten regulations on ' private zoos '			1
owners are now required to have sturdy cages , background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit			1
since the beginning of last year , @entity1 has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts			2
others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes			2
' i know i did n't have everything done , but i thought they 'd work with me , ' said @entity17 , who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he could n't afford everything the state wanted			1
the agriculture department says that it tried , but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last october , nine months after the deadline , when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals			0
state officials in january rejected his application for a permit , which includes a $ 1,000 fee , saying it submitted was too late			1
they also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside @entity115 last november discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages			1
the inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard			1
' if motivated , it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape , ' said @entity130 , assistant state veterinarian			0
@entity17 , whose pickup truck has ' @entity132 ' painted on the side , disputes those assertions			2
' nothing 's ever got loose			0
not in almost 40 years , ' he said			0
' nobody 's ever been bit			0
' empty : a sign affixed to a cage at @entity141 in @entity16 , @entity1 , indicates that it is the home of @entity143 the bear - @entity143 and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in january lonesome : only chief the wolf was n't seized because it does n't fall under the exotic animal law the @entity1 @entity152 has a duty to protect the public 's safety , spokeswoman @entity151 said			1
' just because an animal 's never gotten out , does n't mean that an animal could n't get out , ' she said			2
@entity17 is appealing the department 's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week , but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides			1
until then , the ten animals - a lion named @entity167 that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two - hour drive away outside @entity171 , in a high - security building operated by the state			1
' today , the @entity1 @entity152 did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at @entity141 who have been held illegally and long neglected			0
now , it 's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo â€” a potentially life - threatening move			2
this is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need			0
@entity187 is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first			0
' source : @entity194 supporters of @entity17 believe the animals - only the wolf was n't seized because it does n't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home			1
state officials insist they are fine			1
@entity17 does n't have formal training with wild animals , but he has been around them about 60 years , since he was a ten - year - old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in @entity206 , @entity207			1
his love for wild creatures grew when he moved to @entity1			0
he first brought home an ocelot , often called a dwarf leopard			0
' i tell people do n't start with a tiger if you do n't know what you 're doing , ' he said			2
he and his wife , who died four years ago , spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals			0
even with donations , food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $ 15,000 annually in recent years			0
their collection multiplied , often when others dropped off unwanted pets			0
his daughter , @entity231 , remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool			0
there also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck			0
' i did n't have cats and dogs , ' she said			0
' i had bears and tigers			0
' even the circus camped at his two - acre property while traveling between shows			0
' we had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room , ' she said			0
@entity256 , who has been visiting @entity17 's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children , said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place			1
' there 's never been a time , ' she said , ' where i felt like it 's not safe there			0

in total , six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger ( part lion , part tiger ) were taken from @entity17 's @entity16 farm
state officials found he did n't have the right permit and cages were ' unsafe '
but now the 72 - year - old is fighting to overturn the seizure , backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie does n't pose a threat
' he 's lost without them , ' said @entity52 , who lives four houses away
