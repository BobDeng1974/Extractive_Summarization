by @entity1 reporter published : 08:00 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 5 june 2013 @entity2 told military leaders on tuesday that he can not advise women to join the armed forces amid the sexual assault epidemic that has blighted the @entity8 military			1
senator @entity2 , who built his political career on his record as a @entity12 veteran and former prisoner of war , made the damning comments during a @entity15 yesterday that addressed the widespread sexual assaults that have occurred across all branches of the @entity8 military			1
the @entity19 @entity18 said : ' just last night , a woman came to me and said her daughter wanted to join the military and could i give my unqualified support for her doing so			1
we have to ask ourselves : if left uncorrected , what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of qualified men and women ? ' i can not overstate my disgust and disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our military			1
we â€™ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is insufficient			0
' military leaders admitted sexual assault in the ranks is ' like a cancer ' that could destroy the force , but they rejected efforts by @entity63 to strip commanders of some authority in dealing with cases			1
army general @entity27 , chairman of the @entity34 , and the head of each branch of the military testified at a packed hearing for what is viewed as an epidemic of sexual assault in the services			1
after recent high - profile cases , including an investigation into an alleged sexual assault by three @entity80 football players , lawmakers have moved on legislation to address the scourge of sexual assault			1
@entity86 senator @entity85 , chairman of the @entity15 , said the problem of sexual assault ' is of such a scope and magnitude that it has become a stain on our military '			1
in previous years @entity63 has ensured the investigation and prosecution of sexual assaults , mr @entity85 said , but more needs to be done			2
the committee is considering seven bills to deal with sexual assault			1
as important as additional protections would be , mr @entity85 said , the problem will not be addressed successfully without a cultural change throughout the military			2
and that starts at the top of the chain of command			0
impact : army general @entity108 says sexual assaults are destroying the military reforms : senator @entity112 says commanders should not say if a claim goes to trial ' the military services are hierarchical organizations : the tone is set from the top of that chain , the message comes from the top , and accountability rests at the top , ' mr @entity85 , who has not endorsed any of the bills , said			1
the military leaders offered no disagreement about the impact on the services			0
' sexual assault and harassment are like a cancer within the force - a cancer that left untreated will destroy the fabric of our force , ' army general @entity108 said			1
' it 's imperative that we take a comprehensive approach to prevent attacks , to protect our people and , where appropriate , to prosecute wrongdoing and hold people accountable			0
' while acknowledging the problem and accepting that legislation is inevitable , military leaders insisted that commanders keep their authority to handle sexual assault cases			1
' reducing command responsibility could adversely affect the ability of the commander to enforce professional standards and ultimately , to accomplish the mission , ' @entity27 told the committee			0
the four - star chiefs told the committee they support defense secretary @entity160 's april recommendation to change the @entity161 and mostly curtail commanding officers of the power to throw out a verdict			2
the change , which is included in several of the @entity15 proposals , is likely to be adopted by the @entity167 on wednesday in their version of the annual defense policy bill			0
but service chiefs expressed concern over making broader changes to the military 's legal code that would undercut the ability of commanders to discipline troops			2
@entity108 , the @entity178 's chief of staff , said a commander 's ability to punish quickly , visibly and at the unit level is essential to maintaining discipline			0
out in force : the heads of the @entity8 forces testify about the impact of sexual assaults in the military ' maintaining the central role of the commander in our military justice system is absolutely critical , ' he said			1
one of the bills proposed by @entity195 senator @entity112 , would go the farthest by removing commanders from the process of deciding whether serious crimes , including sexual misconduct cases , go to trial			1
that judgment would rest with trial counsels who have prosecution experience and hold the rank of colonel or above			0
her legislation , which has 18 co-sponsors including four republicans , would take away a commander 's authority to convene a court - martial			0
that responsibility would be given to offices outside the victim 's chain of command			0
commanders would maintain their current authority in the legal process in cases of espionage , theft , sedition and conduct unbecoming an officer in her bill			2
the @entity228 's top officer , general @entity227 , said airmen should have no doubt about who will hold them accountable			0
' commanders having the authority to hold airmen criminally accountable for misconduct ... is crucial to building combat - ready , disciplined units , ' he said			0
a @entity237 report estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year , up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2012 , based on an anonymous survey of military personnel			0
while the number of sexual assaults that members of the military reported rose 6 per cent to 3,374 in 2012 , thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite programs to help them			2
@entity248 , a co-sponsor of the @entity112 bill and chairman of the @entity252 , called the legislation ' bold ' and dismissed concerns that it goes too far in overhauling the military justice system			0
' i think 26,000 sexual assaults is going too far , ' ms @entity248 said			0
' and now there is even a criminal investigation of the football team at the @entity262 , where we are training the next best			0
' the @entity237 said last week that the @entity262 is investigating allegations that three football team members sexually assaulted a female midshipman in @entity267 more than a year ago			0
a lawyer for the woman claimed she was ' ostracized ' on campus after reporting it			0
full house : the congressional hearing into how to stop the rise in cases of sexual assaults was packed other recent cases include a soldier at the @entity279 in @entity195 being charged with secretly photographing women in a bathroom and the arrest of an @entity228 officer , who led a @entity285 and @entity286 unit , on charges of groping a woman			1
@entity289 , the top @entity18 on the committee , said he was wary of proposals to restrict the authority of commanders to discipline their troops			2
' fundamentally we can not abolish sexual assault by legislation alone as you point out			1
eliminating sexual assault requires commanders to drive cultural change and achieve accountability , ' he said			1
the power of a commander under military law to convene courts - martial and uphold or dismiss their verdicts dates back to the @entity308 adopted by the @entity63 in 1775			2
service members were not allowed to appeal a conviction to a higher military court until much later			0
that access to what mr @entity160 has described as a ' robust system of appeal rights ' led to his recommendation to take away a commander 's power to grant clemency in court - martial cases			2
the push by members of @entity63 to further restrict the authority of commanders stems primarily from a case in which @entity228 lieutenant general @entity325 overturned a guilty verdict against a lieutenant colonel convicted on charges of abusive sexual contact and aggravated sexual assault			1
in cautioning against making significant changes to military law without careful consideration , general @entity227 told the committee that complete reversals of court - martial findings in @entity228 sexual assault cases were rare			1
lieutenant general @entity325 's decision is the only one out of 327 cases over the past five years , he said .			0

senator @entity2 said he could not support women joining the military while sexual assault epidemic spreads
rise in cases could destroy the forces , commanders say
proposals to reform how cases are handled seen as removing power
