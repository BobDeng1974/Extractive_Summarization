the group of backbenchers wrote to the prime minister saying the @entity20 should be able to block @entity9 legislation and repeal measures that threaten the @entity23 's ' national interest '			1
@entity24 currently has no automatic veto over @entity9 laws , and the prime minister can only use the @entity23 's veto to head off new rules in the most sensitive issues - such as defence and the budget			1
according to @entity36 , signatories of the missive , which was drafted by senior mp @entity35 , include @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and former defence minister sir @entity41			1
a committee of mps which scrutinises @entity9 laws last month recommended that a national veto be introduced			1
and the @entity4 ' letter , sent to the prime minister this weekend , called on mr @entity2 to adopt the policy			1
‘ each time you have stood up for @entity23 interests in @entity16 , you have achieved a great deal , ’ it said			2
‘ building on your achievements , we would urge you to back the @entity56 proposal and make the idea of a national veto over current and future @entity9 laws a reality			1
’ the letter stated that a new national veto over @entity9 laws would ‘ enable @entity24 to disapply @entity9 legislation , where it is in our vital national interests to do so ’			1
it added : ‘ this would transform the @entity23 's negotiating position in the @entity9			2
’ the letter said the veto - which would require a new @entity70 - could be used to deliver key reforms to @entity23 's relations with @entity11			2
that could include gaining control over immigration from within the @entity9			0
the @entity4 ' letter , sent to the prime minister this weekend , was drafted by senior mp @entity35 @entity24 currently has no automatic veto over @entity9 laws , and the prime minister can only use the @entity23 's veto to head off new rules in the most sensitive issues - such as defence and the budget in their letter , the @entity4 praised mr @entity2 for his insistence that national parliaments , not bureaucrats in @entity16 , are ‘ the true source ’ of democratic legitimacy in the @entity9			1
‘ however , clarity about how we will achieve these objectives is vital for our credibility , ’ the letter says			0
mr @entity35 , chairman of the @entity20 public administration committee , said the identities of all 95 formal signatories are included in the letter but most of the names are not intended to be made public			1
in an article for the @entity36 , he wrote : ‘ the privately declared supporters of this letter represent more than half the back benches			0
‘ we speak for the mainstream of the modern @entity5 in @entity24 and in our constituencies , and for the voting public , both in the @entity23 and throughout @entity11			0
’ a @entity110 spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister set out his approach in his @entity114 speech			0
‘ he has already won his battle over @entity56 bank bailouts , cut the @entity9 budget for the first time and launched a landmark debate on the future of freedom of movement			0
‘ the prime minister is also the only one of the three main party leaders committed to giving the @entity23 people an in - out referendum on membership of a reformed @entity9			0
' the missive is signed by 95 @entity5 mps , including former defence minister sir @entity41 ( pictured ) they added : ‘ we will of course study this idea closely			0
but we need to look at what it would mean in practice			0
‘ we 've always been clear that @entity24 is sovereign and more power for national parliaments must be a key part of a new settlement , including a ' red card ' power so groups of national parliaments can block unwanted @entity9 interference			2
‘ but if individual national parliaments regularly and unilaterally overturned @entity9 laws the @entity142 would n't work , and even a @entity146 - style free trade deal with the @entity9 would n't be possible			2
‘ it is important to negotiate a new deal for @entity23 in the @entity9 and then put the choice to the @entity23 people : stay in the @entity9 on new terms or leave altogether			0
