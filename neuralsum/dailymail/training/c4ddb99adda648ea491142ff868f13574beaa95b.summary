@entity0 quit as @entity2 manager amid fears of cuts to his budget for the new season and the prospect of losing his most influential players ahead of a crucial @entity10 qualifying campaign			1
just hours after @entity12 exclusively revealed @entity0 ’s impending departure , the news was confirmed in a lengthy club statement			1
despite the amicable separation , it is understood there were frustrations behind the scenes			0
certainly , after leading the current @entity21 champions to three successive titles and two @entity21 cups as well as a place in the last 16 of the @entity10 , @entity0 was left wondering how much further he could take @entity2			1
but those concerns were magnified by his fears he would not have the financial clout to make the @entity10 group stage for a third successive year — especially if key players @entity30 and @entity31 are sold this summer			2
‘ it was an absolute honour to play for this great club , to captain the team and of course to become @entity2 manager , a position which i cherished dearly			0
‘ however , i feel the time is now right to move on to a new challenge			0
‘ serving the club was always a privilege			0
i have always given my best and aimed to do all i can to ensure success for @entity2 ; as a supporter it was all i wanted			0
‘ i will assist the club in appointing my successor			0
as ever , we will need our fans ’ support and i am sure they will give the club and the new manager the same great backing which they gave to myself			0
’ now the search is on for a new boss with club legend @entity64 strongly linked with the @entity65 — currently in charge of @entity68 club @entity67 — refused to rule himself out of the running last night and said : ‘ i can see myself back at @entity2 , but whether it ’s now or in the future time will tell			1
’ @entity12 understands , however , @entity2 have also made discreet enquiries via third parties over former defender @entity74 ’s availability			1
@entity74 joins @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 on an exhaustive list of potential appointments			1
@entity80 : @entity0 thanked all of his @entity2 players as well as the ' magnificent ' supporters former @entity85 manager @entity84 will not put himself forward as a candidate for the post , although @entity89 boss @entity88 is understood to be interested			1
@entity0 will fly off on a family holiday today to consider his options ahead of a stint as a @entity94 analyst at the @entity95 finals			1
he had been strongly linked with the @entity97 post but that job was last night given to @entity99 , who had taken charge after @entity102 ’s sacking			1
@entity0 ’s agent @entity103 said : ‘ he has nothing lined up			1
@entity0 just feels now is the time to move on to the next challenge			1
’ @entity2 chief executive @entity107 thanked @entity0 for his efforts and said : ‘ when we appointed @entity0 as manager we did so knowing exactly what the club meant to him and knowing he would give all he had			1
‘ he has delivered great success to our supporters domestically and has brought us back to the table in @entity117 football			0
‘ he will always be a part of the club and we wish @entity0 and his family nothing but success in the future			1
’ @entity107 will be keen to find a replacement soon with @entity10 qualifiers beginning in just eight weeks ’ time			0
‘ we now embark on a new and exciting chapter for the club , ’ @entity107 said			0
‘ we are sure our fans will give us their usual support as we aim to bring them more and more success and continue to make @entity2 a club they can be proud of			0
’ returning hero ? @entity64 has been installed as favourite to become new boss @entity64 would be a popular appointment with the fans , although many question his lack of experience for filing a high - pressure post			1
@entity12 understands the @entity68 icon is not a front - runner for the job despite bookmakers making the 42 - year - old odds - on favourite			2
‘ when i stopped playing and went into management i knew the @entity2 job was one that i would be linked with , ’ @entity64 said			1
‘ i have , and always will have , a strong affection with the club			0
it ’s not a question of whether i ’d be up for it			0
‘ at the moment i ’m only focusing on the job at @entity154			2
i can see myself back at @entity2 , but whether it ’s now or in the future , time will tell			0
’ @entity67 sporting director @entity158 has already denied contact from the @entity161 club			2
asked if he himself had held any talks , @entity64 said enigmatically : ‘ let me put it this way , i always have had good contact with the people at @entity2 and i continue to have good contact with the club			2
‘ that ’s all i am going to say			0
it ’s up to you to work out if there ’s been contact			0
’ the @entity2 legend took control of @entity67 in march after a spell at modest outfit @entity178			0
neither club compares to the scale or demands at @entity2 and there is little in @entity64 ’s managerial career to suggest he should be appointed as @entity0 ’s successor			1
meet the new boss ? @entity76 and former team - mate @entity0 discuss the good old days last month in the running : @entity74 has been touted for a @entity2 return too @entity190 @entity189 addressed those concerns when he said of the @entity64 speculation : ‘ @entity64 is a fabulous name and the @entity2 legions adored him as a player			1
‘ however , the club need a steady pair of hands at the moment , someone who can hit the ground running			2
‘ with the greatest of respect , @entity64 is not that man			2
‘ sure , he might put bums on seats , but my old club need a manager who can come in right away to take control and start to organise things			0
’ meanwhile , @entity212 defender @entity211 insisted his boss @entity76 has unfinished business at @entity215			2
a former @entity2 captain , @entity76 has had an impressive first season on @entity218 , and recently turned down an approach from @entity220 who were impressed by his work building a thrilling side packed with talented kids			1
yet while @entity211 can understand why bigger clubs like @entity2 would be very keen to land the 40 - year - old , he expects @entity76 to be his boss next season			1
‘ the manager is going to be linked with @entity2 but i think he is happy at @entity85 — and he ’s got unfinished business , as do we as players after the @entity233 defeat			2
‘ but i can understand 100 per cent why he would be linked			0
he ’s had a good season and everyone is taking notice of his team ’s style of play			0

@entity0 quit over budget fears for next season
departure will spark interest from the @entity246 and @entity247
@entity249 won three league titles at @entity161 in four years
