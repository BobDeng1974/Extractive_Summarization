scientists have long wondered why the @entity1 and @entity2 are so culturally different to @entity3 and other countries in @entity5			0
now one study claims the answer lies in an unexpected area : the different farming methods used by people living in the @entity11			1
while westerners are known for their individualism and analytical thinking , eastern culture tends to be interdependent and holistic , the study claims			1
@entity18 in the @entity19 ( right ) can not be grown without ample supplies of water , forcing neighbours to work together			1
it is also highly labour - intensive , requiring twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat			2
western wheat farmers ( left ) , in contrast , can rely on the rain and operate much more independently theories explaining the differences have included wealth and education fuelling individualism in the @entity34 , and high rates of infectious disease in the @entity19 causing people to be wary of outsiders			1
but the real reason may simply be the way people at both ends of the world cultivate rice and wheat , say the scientists			1
@entity18 can not be grown without ample supplies of water , forcing neighbours to work together to irrigate their crops			0
it is also highly labour - intensive , requiring about twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat			2
scientists assessed known measures of individualism and collectivism in 1,000 people from different regions of @entity3 where rice and wheat are grown			1
the results , published in the journal @entity62 , showed distinct psychological differences that mirrored those between the @entity19 and @entity34 wheat farmers , in contrast , can rely on the rain and operate much more independently			1

‘ it ’s easy to think of @entity3 as a single culture , ’ said lead researcher @entity73 , from the @entity74			2
‘ but we found that @entity3 has very distinct northern and southern psychological cultures and that southern @entity3 ’s history of rice farming can explain why people in southern @entity3 are more interdependent than people in the wheat - growing north			1
‘ the data suggests that legacies of farming are continuing to affect people in the modern world			2
’ the @entity91 prefers @entity92 , and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer , a new study of @entity1 's drinking habits has revealed			0
researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers			0
they found tweet preferences for @entity92 were found mainly in the @entity5 half of the @entity1 , while preferences for @entity104 originate in the @entity34 half , particularly near @entity106 and surrounding states			0
other beer spaces included @entity110 preferences in the @entity111 and @entity112 , and brands like @entity114 and @entity115 in the @entity117 border regions of the @entity1 most wine - related tweets were sent from the wine - growing regions of @entity122 , @entity123 , and northern and central @entity124			0
overall , residents of the eastern and western @entity1 coastal regions were more partial to wine ( or at least were more likely to tweet about it ) , while people from several @entity111 states and into @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 were more apt to tweet about beer			0

study says that while westerners are known for their individualism and analytical thinking , eastern culture tends to be interdependent and holistic
it puts this down to fact that rice farming in the @entity19 requires *teamwork*
wheat farmers , in contrast , rely on rain and operate more independently
