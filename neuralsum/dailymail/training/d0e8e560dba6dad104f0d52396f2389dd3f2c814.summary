as our vessel cut through the @entity4 waves , the dolphins tucked themselves under the bow , taking it in turns to playfully surf the wake			1
in any other circumstances , it would have been a beautiful sight			1
but now i could hardly bear to watch , sick to my stomach at the prospect of what was about to happen			2
for up above the dolphins , on the deck of the @entity18 fishing boat , stood its captain , brandishing a razor - sharp harpoon			1
there was a momentary pause ... and then he struck , hurling 30kg of tubular steel into the dolphin ’s back as it swam alongside			2
as the harpoon sliced through the dolphin ’s flesh , a cry of excitement went up from the crew as they celebrated their catch			2
our cameraman ale and i watched in horror as the rope attached to the harpoon snaked away from the boat			1
fifty yards away , the dolphin ’s beak broke the surface as it struggled to escape the line , slowly tiring as it became enveloped in a thick cloud of its own blood			2
two crewmen dragged the rope in , the dolphin still desperately thrashing , but there was to be no miracle escape			2
as the dying animal neared the boat , a shiny steel hook was plunged into its head and it was hauled aboard , intestines pouring out of the wound where the harpoon had gone clean through			2
the body was still twitching			2
fatal shot : the fisherman lets loose his 30kg harpoon after taking careful aim a crew member sharpened a knife and casually began to slice off the fins , tossing them into the @entity80 the thick puddle of bright red blood widened , he began to peel the skin off its back			2
the hunt was over , the dolphin dead , the fishermen had their bait			1
with the excitement temporarily at an end , the crew were quickly back into their normal routine			2
the salsa music went back on the wheelhouse stereo and a cry from the cook announced that lunch was ready			2
a crew member handed me a bowl of soup but as i crouched on the deck next to the skinless carcass of an animal that only a few moments earlier had been effortlessly racing through the ocean waves , i vomited			2
i looked at @entity107 and saw the same look of nauseous horror on his face but we both knew we could say nothing			2
we were 100km off shore , surrounded by fishermen who regarded what we had just seen as entirely normal : to say anything about the killing or to be seen portraying any negative emotion could be very dangerous			1
hauling : the fisherman drag up the dolphin carcass before butchering it on board the ship but at least we had finally witnessed what we had come to see			1
we had concrete proof of what , until now , had only been rumour : namely that thousands of dolphins are being killed by @entity18 fishermen who then cut them up and use them as bait for shark fishing			1
in marine conservation terms , that ’s a double catastrophe , with dolphins — many species of which are protected — being killed to catch sharks , many species of which are now endangered			1
it is thought to be the world ’s biggest dolphin slaughter and , as an investigative environmental journalist , i was determined to see it for myself			2
i secured the bulk of my funding from the @entity151 , an @entity152 organisation , and set about trying to arrange a trip			2
after months of patient negotiation , i ’d found a skipper willing to take us in exchange for a contribution for fuel and the strict promise of anonymity			2
the @entity18 fishermen call dolphins ‘ sea - pigs ’			1
it ’s a term that does no justice to their elegant movement through the water but , from the fishermen ’s point of view , is perhaps a not unreasonable description of an animal that supplies meat that seems tailor - made for shark fishing			1
butchery : the fisherman uses a sharp knife to slice off the dolphins fins , which are then discarded with its rich blood supply , sharks are instantly attracted to fresh dolphin meat and , best of all , unlike other shark bait it ’s absolutely free			1
so on our third day out of port , my heart sank when i heard the skipper ’s excited cry of ‘ chenchos ! ’ - ‘ fat pigs ’ - and we saw half a dozen dolphins break away from feeding on the anchovy shoals that the nutrient - rich @entity18 waters support in such abundance and race towards the boat to ride our bow - wave			1
it should have been a moment to gladden the heart but ours were heavy			2
as the captain stood poised with his harpoon , ale and i leapt into position to film			0
it was n’t enough to see the dolphin killed with our own eyes , we had to have a permanent record that we could take back and show to the world			0
but there was more killing to come			0
by dawn the next day , we had arrived at the fishing ground , a thin sliver on the chart where the water temperature was just right for sharks			1
the decks had been hosed down and , in the corner , the dolphin carcass lay flensed - stripped of skin - a long section of flesh sliced out of it			0
two crew members were now chopping it into long slivers , tossing each piece into the bait box alongside the expensive salted mackerel that had been bought for the same purpose			1
the captain was very honest about the benefits of dolphin bait			1
‘ @entity237 meat is effective for the blue shark , ’ he says			1
‘ when you cut it , it bleeds a lot			0
and the blue shark likes fat , and the dolphin is pure fat			0
carving : the deck is filled with dolphin blood as the fishermen set to work ‘ i understand that to hunt the dolphin is illegal			1
but for me , it ’s a necessity , i do it to keep my bills down			0
i can minimise my costs , because the bait for shark is very expensive			1
the majority of boats that fish shark carry the spear - gun with the spear ready to use			0
’ he said he would normally kill two to three dolphins per trip and make 12 trips a year but , with 500 shark boats in @entity18 at the last count , that suggests expert estimates of 10,000 dolphins being killed by @entity18 fishermen every year could be an understatement			1
the meat of the sharks is sold to dealers waiting at the harbour and is destined for dinner plates across the world			1
the shark fins are sent to the @entity278 for soup			0
in the stern of our 40ft fishing boat , two crew - members crouched , carefully skewering dolphin flesh and mackerel on to hooks on the fishing line			1
a buoy was dropped in the water and , as the boat chugged slowly away from it , the line was fed out behind it			0
two hours later and the hooks — a thousand of them — were spread out in the water			0
now all the crew could do was wait and try to get some sleep , knowing they had a busy night ahead of them			0
as the sun set and the temperature dropped , they donned water - proofs and wellington boots and drank soup enriched with maca , an energy - giving @entity18 root			1
harvest : the fishermen use dolphin meat as a cheap sort of shark bait then it was time to haul in the catch			1
ale and i watched in the darkness , cameras ready , as the fishing line was carefully picked up and coiled by the crew			1
and then suddenly there was a shout			0
the engine slowed and a spotlight shone down into the dark waters below			0
a svelte , silvery - blue shape gradually appeared in the water			0
it was our first shark			0
swimming in its normal underwater habitat , the blue shark is a beautiful sight , its tubular torso and wide eyes endowing it with a gentle elegance			0
but there was nothing elegant about this one			0
hooked and already half - drowned — sharks have to keep swimming to stay alive — it appeared almost drunk , lazily kicking away at the line that now drew it to the boat			1
within seconds , it was hauled over the gunwale and slammed on to the decks , thrashing around			0
and then the crew fell upon it			0
one sliced off its entire snout , just in front of its soft white eyes			0
endgame : the fisherman haul up shark , caught with the scraps of dolphin meat ruthlessly harvested earlier into the gaping hole , a long thin rod was rapidly inserted down the shark ’s spinal column and , at last , the thrashing stopped			1
its belly was cut open , the insides washed over the side and the shark carcass tossed to the leeward side of the deck			0
it would be the first of a dozen sharks the boat would catch , kill and butcher that night			1
an hour in , the engine slowed again amid excited shouts from the deck hands			0
all four men dropped their work to help haul in the line			0
slowly , a vast black shape emerged from the depths			0
it was a fully - grown thresher shark , a species recently classified as vulnerable to extinction			0
several hundred kilos in weight , its characteristically elongated tail fin alone was 6 ft long			0
for a moment or two longer , it was still a beautiful marine creature and then the knives flashed and it joined the growing pile of meat			1
but there was worse still to come			0
another blue shark was dragged to the surface , still thrashing in the water			0
when its belly was opened up , dozens of perfectly formed baby sharks slid out , writhing on the deck			1
this was too much for @entity107 and me			0
having sat back for days , not interfering and saying nothing , we had to do something			0
we waved at the crew , pleading with them to put the live baby sharks in the sea			1
they laughed — the idea was comical to them — but they did round up the baby sharks and toss them over the side			1
the beam of a torch revealed the tiny fishes ’ first clumsy movements in the ocean			0
the odds on them surviving were slim but at least they now had a chance			0
exhausted by the killing and no longer able to trust myself , i left a deck covered in blood , writhing sharks and savage hooks and descended to the cabin			1
in every sense , i ’d had - and seen - enough .			0

fishermen in @entity18 hunt and butcher dolphins , even though it *'s* illegal
they harvest meat from the animals to use as cheap bait for sharks
@entity449 negotiated *passage* on a fishing ship to see it for himself
he and his cameraman witnessed the brutal process from start to finish
