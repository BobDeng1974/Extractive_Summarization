@entity0 has postponed her @entity2 tour so she can take care of her dying 13 - year - old pitbull , whom she calls her ' best friend , mother , daughter and the one who taught me how to love '			1
in an extraordinary four - page letter posted to her website and @entity14 page , the singer explained her decision to forgo her 12 - date tour , which was due to start in @entity17 next week			1
' here 's the thing , ' she wrote in the scanned letter			1
' i have a dog @entity22 , and she 's been ill for almost two years now , as a tumor has been idling in her chest , growing ever so slowly			1
' i know that she is coming close to point where she will stop being a dog , and instead , be part of everything			1
she 'll be in the wind , and in the soil , and the snow , and in me , wherever i go			2
best friends : singer @entity0 is pictured walking her dog @entity22 in 2008			1
she has now postponed her @entity2 tour to care for the pet , whom she believes is dying ' i ca n't come to @entity2 , not now			1
if i go away again , i 'm afraid she 'll die and i wo n't have the honour of singing her to sleep , of escorting her out			0
' the poetic letter explains she found @entity22 in @entity42 in @entity43 ten years ago ' with a rope around her neck , and bites all over her ears and face ' - a sign she had been used as a fighting dog			1
but after taking in the four - month - old puppy , @entity50 realised the dog was in fact a ' pacifist ' who went on to provide ' the most consistent relationship of my adult life '			1
' we 've lived in numerous houses , and jumped a few make shift families , but it 's always really been the two of us , ' she wrote			1
' please understand ' : @entity50 was due to perform 12 dates across @entity2 starting next week the dog gave her support ' every time i was heartbroken , or spirit - broken , or just lost ' and sat beside her as she wrote and recorded four albums , @entity50 explained			1
but recently , @entity22 has slowed			1
she suffers from @entity72 's disease , an adrenal deficiency , and requires regular injections of @entity75			1
two years ago , veterinarians found a tumor in her chest			1
' when i got back from the last leg of the @entity83 tour , there was a big , big difference			0
she does n't even want to go for walks anymore , ' she wrote			2
' i just ca n't leave her now , please understand			0
' she concluded her letter by explaining that , although she often takes 20 minutes to choose which socks to wear , the decision to drop out of the tour was easy			1

click on the images for enlarged versions ' these are the choices we make , which define us , ' @entity50 explained			1
' i am not the woman who puts her career ahead of love and friendship			2
' i am asking for your blessing			0
i 'll be seeing you			0
' she was scheduled to perform three concerts in @entity17 next week , then travel to @entity114 and @entity115 , but fans put aside their disappointment to commend @entity50 for her decision			1
' it is clear that the bond you have with @entity22 is one that deserves to be treasured , ' fan @entity119 wrote on @entity14			1
' i commend you for making the right , but probably most difficult choice			0
it speaks volumes about your character			0
' @entity129 added : ' @entity131 , we 're so sad reading this , ' cause many of us are waiting for your concert since 1996			0
but be sure , 99 per cent of your @entity17 fans are with you , wishing you all the best			2
your heart is exactly where it should be			0
' back on track : @entity50 , pictured performing in @entity140 , began touring this year after a five - year hiatus @entity50 released her debut album , @entity144 , in 1996			1
she stopped touring in 2007 but returned earlier this year with the release of her fourth album , snappily entitled @entity147 will serve you more @entity148			0
in september , the 35 - year - old singer was arrested after police found hashish and marijuana on her tour bus at a @entity156 border patrol checkpoint			1
she spent the night in @entity157 and was released the following day after posting $ 10,000 bail			0
it 's 6pm on friday , and i 'm writing to a few thousand friends i have not met yet			2
i am writing to ask them to change our plans and meet a little while later			0
i have a dog @entity22 , and she 's been ill for almost two years now , as a tumor has been idling in her chest , growing ever so slowly			1
she 's almost 14 years old now			1
i got her when she was 4 months old			0
i was 21 then , an adult officially - and she was my child			2
she is a pitbull , and was found in @entity42 , with a rope around her neck , and bites all over her ears and face			1
she was the one the dogfighters use to puff up the confidence of the contenders			0
she 's almost 14 and i 've never seen her start a fight , or bite , or even growl , so i can understand why they chose her for that awful role			2
@entity22 has been the most consistent relationship of my adult life , and that is just a fact			1
we 've lived in numerous houses , and jumped a few make shift families , but it 's always really been the two of us			2
she slept in bed with me , her head on the pillow , and she accepted my hysterical , tearful face into her chest , with her paws around me , every time i was heartbroken , or spirit - broken , or just lost , and as years went by , she let me take the role of her child , as i fell asleep , with her chin resting above my head			1
she was under the piano when i wrote songs , barked any time i tried to record anything , and she was in the studio with me all the time we recorded the last album			2
the last time i came back from tour , she was spry as ever , and she 's used to me being gone for a few weeks every 6 or 7 years			1
she has @entity211 , which makes it dangerous for her to travel since she needs regular injections of @entity75 , because she reacts to stress and to excitement without the physiological tools which keep most of us from literally panicking to death			2
despite all of this , she ’s effortlessly joyful and playful , and only stopped acting like a puppy about 3 years ago			1
she 's my best friend and my mother and my daughter , my benefactor , and she 's the one who taught me what love is			1
i ca n't come to @entity2			0
when i got back from the last leg of the @entity83 tour , there was a big , big difference			0
she does n't even want to go for walks anymore			0
i know that she 's not sad about aging or dying			2
animals have a survival instinct , but a sense of mortality and vanity , they do not			0
that ’s why they are so much more present than people			0
but i know that she is coming close to point where she will stop being a dog , and instead , be part of everything			2
she ’ll be in the wind , and in the soil , and the snow , and in me , wherever i go			0
i just ca n't leave her now , please understand			0
if i go away again , i ’m afraid she 'll die and i wo n't have the honor of singing her to sleep , of escorting her out			0
sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to pick which socks to wear to bed			0
but this decision is @entity252 are the choices we make , which define us			2
i will not be the woman who puts her career ahead of love and friendship			2
i am the woman who stays home and bakes @entity261 for my dearest , oldest friend			0
and helps her be comfortable , and comforted , and safe , and important			0
many of us these days , we dread the death of a loved one			2
it is the ugly truth of life , that keeps us feeling terrified and alone			0
i wish we could also appreciate the time that lies right beside the end of time			0
i know that i will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her , and of her life and of my love for her , in the last moments			2
i need to do my damnedest to be there for that			0
because it will be the most beautiful , the most intense , the most enriching experience of life i 've ever known			0
so i am staying home , and i am listening to her snore and wheeze , and reveling in the swampiest , most awful breath that ever emanated from an angel			0
and i am asking for your @entity290 'll be seeing you			0
