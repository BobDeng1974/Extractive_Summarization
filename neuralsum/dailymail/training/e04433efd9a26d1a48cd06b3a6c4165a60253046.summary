@entity1 's skies will be filled with drones within ten years , according to one of the government 's top aviation chiefs			1
the sight of unmanned aircraft could become common place by 2023 once a ' detect and avoid ' system is in place to ensure they can join the country 's crowded airspace			1
the technology will be used increasingly for surveillance purposes and by delivery firms in a move that could revolutionise the way we shop , according to @entity20 , the head of aviation safety at the @entity22			1
i hear of a new one almost every day			0
' people are becoming resourceful , in the same way as when the internet came on the scene and people were looking at different ways to use that technology			2
' we hear a lot of stories about @entity44 delivering goods to your door and i am sure there will be a lot more use of this ( technology )			1
' @entity44 created a media frenzy in december 2013 when it outlined a plan to deliver packages with self - guided aircrafts			1
in august , it was reported that the online retailer was asking the @entity57 for permission to use drones as part of its plan to deliver packages to customers in 30 minutes or less			1
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5lbs			2
about 86 percent of @entity44 's deliveries are 5lbs or less , the company said			1
@entity70 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers			1
the total weight , including the package to be delivered , is approximately 10kg ( 22lb )			0
the aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg ( 18.7lb )			2
the hybrid ' tail sitter ' design has wings for fast forward flight , and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take - off and landing			0
@entity70 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers dual mode operation gives the self - flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters			1
it can take off or land without a runway , and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages			2
packages are stored in the drone 's ' belly ' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground			1
at the end of the tether , there is a bundle of electronics the team call the ' egg , ' which detects that the package has hit the ground , detaches from the delivery , and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle			0
in the same month it was revealed that @entity117 has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages			1
called @entity70 , it is being developed at @entity122 , the company 's secret research lab. the firm says the drones could eventually be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas - and for package delivery			2
separate trials have taken place to test their effectiveness in crop spraying and in conservation by tracking the movement of animals			0
there are also hopes they could help to speed up the delivery of donor organs and monitor traffic and transport networks			0
the technology will be used increasingly for surveillance purposes and by delivery firms in a move that could revolutionise the way we shop in april , it was revealed how criminals were using cheap kit bought from supermarkets to build heat seeking drones they can use to track down cannabis farms			1
tech - savvy thieves were reportedly buying drones for as little as Â£ 60 from supermarkets and attaching infra - red cameras to them , which they can monitor via an @entity163			0
by flying the modified drones over houses , they can locate the drug dens , as cannabis farms produce a large amount of heat			0
burglars were said to be breaking in to the premises and stealing the crop to sell on the streets			0
the @entity27 reports that the @entity176 @entity175 internal market , infrastructure and employment sub-committee this week discussed the question of whether there was a need for @entity175 - wide drone legislation			0
@entity183 from @entity184 , a @entity185 - based company that sells custom drones , said use of the unmanned craft will increase over the next decade			2
he said : ' next year there is going to be limited use of driverless cars on the road			0
as people get used to that , the concept of having some little flying machine that comes to deliver you something will not be that far fetched			0

drones could become common sight in @entity1 by 2023 , it has been claimed
technology could be used to revolutionise the way we shop , expert says
@entity210 's head of aviation safety , @entity20 outlines future *impact* of unmanned aircraft
