sooo emotional but happy tears too.x ' a cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help provide a sense of sound to a person who is deaf or severely hard of hearing			1
an external portion of the implants sits behind the ear , while a second part is surgically placed under the skin			0
the implants can not restore normal hearing but they can give a deaf person a good representation of sounds , helping them understand speech			2
surgery : the small electronic device consists of two parts , the external section sits behind the ear while a second part is surgically fitted under the skin whereas hearing aids amplify sound so they can be detected by damaged ears , cochlear implants bypass damaged parts of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve			1
signals generated by the implant are sent via the auditory nerve to the brain , which recognises the signals as sound			0
hearing through an implant is different from normal hearing and takes time to get used to it			0
it allows people to recognise warning signals , understand their environment and enjoy conversations with people			0
according to the @entity262 , as of december 2012 , around 324,200 people worldwide have been fitted with implants			2
in the @entity265 @entity264 estimates about 10,000 people have cochlear implants and the number is growing every year .			1
