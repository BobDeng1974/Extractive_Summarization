@entity0 pictured with his wife @entity1 , daughter @entity2 , adopted son @entity3 and a friend of his daughter at first glance , the letters read like those sent by any other travelling businessman to his much - loved wife and daughter			1
‘ in the next few days i ’ll be in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and then in the new headquarters , ’ writes the 41 - year - old chief executive officer of a massive pan-european corporation			1
‘ i ’m curious if and how i will be able to phone , as it will probably be around 2,000 kilometres to @entity23			1
all the best , have a nice trip and enjoy your days with our little daughter			1
many warm greetings and kisses ! ’ there is one word that immediately leaps out in this otherwise banal missive			2
that word is , of course , ‘ @entity16 ’			2
for the writer of the letter is no ordinary executive on the road			2
it was in fact written by one of the most notorious mass murderers in history — @entity0			1
as head of the dreaded @entity47 , @entity45 ’s @entity44 guard , @entity0 ’s ‘ business ’ was to orchestrate the mass shootings and gassings of millions of @entity50 and other ‘ undesirables ’			1
when he wrote the letter to his wife @entity1 , a nurse , and their daughter @entity2 in july 1942 , @entity0 was about to embark on a tour during which he would personally oversee the repellent and horrific ‘ work ’ that he ordered his men to carry out			1
just a few weeks later , while watching a massacre in @entity63 , the face and coat of this proud family man were spattered with the blood of a jew who had just been shot			2
‘ he [ @entity0 ] was n’t actually sick , ’ one witness recalled , ‘ but he was heaving and turned round and swayed and then i had to jump forward and hold him steady and then i led him away from the grave			2
’ this chilling contrast between the public , murderous life of @entity0 and the affectionate details of his private , domestic life came to light yesterday with the publication by the @entity81 newspaper @entity80 of a cache of hitherto unseen letters written by the @entity47 leader to his family			1
their release has been timed to coincide with today ’s @entity88			2
the papers had lain hidden for several decades in @entity90 , having been bought by an @entity92 @entity88 survivor called @entity93 in the final days of @entity94 in 2007 , @entity93 sold the collection to a film - maker called @entity97 , who will shortly release a documentary about the letters , which she is calling the @entity100			1
the title is an ironic reference to a notorious speech @entity0 made in october 1943 , in which he spoke openly about exterminating the @entity50			1
‘ most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other , ’ he told a @entity44 gathering , ‘ when there are 500 or when there are a 1,000			2
to have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough , and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of			2
’ the notion that @entity0 , despite ordering a genocide , could have remained ‘ decent ’ , is clearly absurd , but as the letters show , the @entity47 leader continued to believe himself to be a loving family man			1
the letters reveal @entity0 as seemingly able to separate the two sides of his personality			1
these letters reveal @entity0 as seemingly able to separate the two sides of his personality as head of the dreaded @entity47 , @entity45 's @entity44 guard , @entity0 's ' business ' was to orchestrate the mass shootings and gassings of millions of @entity50 and other ' undesirables ' just a few days before @entity44 ’s attack on the @entity135 in june 1941 , @entity0 spent a few halcyon days with his family in an idyllic part of @entity138			1
as the three of them explored the beautiful countryside , @entity0 did not mention to either his wife or daughter that his beloved @entity47 and the @entity81 armed forces were about to mobilise on an epic scale in order to try to defeat @entity147			1
@entity0 ’s wife only seemed to have learned about the attack later when the news became public			1
‘ now we are at war again , ’ she wrote to her husband on june 22			2
i did n’t sleep well at all			2
’ while millions suffered the privations brought about by the war , the @entity155 continued to have a taste for the high life			2
‘ there is still one can of caviar in the fridge , ’ @entity1 told her husband			2
’ the collection of documents also contains @entity1 ’s wartime account book , which shows that she was spending extravagantly — about ten times more than the average household			2
however , while his wife concerned herself with domesticity , it seems that @entity0 ’s daughter , @entity2 , then 11 years old , was more perceptive in her analysis of the political situation			1
she too wrote to @entity0 on june 22 that year			0
‘ it ’s terrible that we are going to war with @entity180 , ’ she declared			0
‘ they were our allies after all			0
the struggle will be very difficult if we want to conquer all of @entity180			0
’ it is not known whether @entity0 replied to that letter , but it seems likely that he did not , as a few days later , he wrote to @entity1 , apologising for forgetting their wedding anniversary ‘ for the first time ’			0
‘ there is quite a lot going on these days , ’ he admitted			0
‘ the fighting is very hard , especially for the @entity47 ’ although @entity0 and his wife still appeared to be on good terms , the newly uncovered letters provide a fascinating insight into how the couple ’s relationship had , in fact , deteriorated			1
their early correspondence from the days of the courtship in the @entity202 is romantic — and even sometimes sexual — in tone			0
this photograph , from may 1944 , shows @entity45 shaking hands with @entity0 @entity0 , who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout @entity209 , is seen here inspecting a @entity180 prisoner of war @entity0 would call himself a ‘ roughneck ’ , and he referred to himself as a ruthless street fighter			0
he was proud of this roughness in the bedroom			0
‘ i am so lucky to have such a good bad man who loves his bad wife as much as she loves him , ’ @entity1 wrote			1
the couple would speak of sex as being ‘ revenge ’			0
‘ i ’m for nothing but “ @entity224 ” all the time , ’ he wrote to @entity1 in january 1928 when he was on a train to @entity222			0
‘ remember “ revenge ” , ’ @entity1 insisted in april that year			0
‘ my black soul is thinking up the most impossible things			0
’ but over the years , the couple ’s passion cooled to such an extent that , by 1938 , @entity0 had found himself a mistress — his secretary — with whom he had two children			0
@entity0 also adopted a son , @entity3 , with @entity1 , though the boy did not take his surname			0
instead of addressing @entity1 as ‘ my dear sweetheart ’ , he started to write to her — somewhat bizarrely — as ‘ @entity238 ’			0
nevertheless , @entity0 did still care for his wife and daughter			1
throughout the war , he would send them luxurious treats			0
in may 1942 , for example , he sent @entity1 and @entity246 tulips from @entity247			0
‘ striped , jagged , two colours , one colour , ’ he wrote			0
‘ the kind you can not find here			0
’ even when the couple drifted apart , there was one belief that they continued to share fiercely : their hatred for the @entity50			1
in her early letters , @entity1 complained about how ‘ @entity50 scum ’ scared her , and how she resented having to deal with a @entity50 doctor , @entity260 , with whom she co-owned a clinic in @entity262			1
‘ this @entity263 ! ’ she exclaimed in may 1928			0
‘ a jew will always be a jew ! ’ ‘ do n’t get worked up about the @entity50 , dear , dear woman , ’ @entity0 replied , ‘ if i could only help you			1
’ @entity0 is seen here with his daughter , @entity2 a decade later , her husband ’s fellow @entity270 would indeed ‘ help ’ the likes of @entity1 , by organising the brutal @entity274 , or @entity274 , in november 1938 , which saw 90 jews killed , and thousands of synagogues and @entity50 businesses destroyed			1
@entity1 was delighted , but , like her husband , believed the @entity47 could go further			0
‘ this thing with the @entity50 , ’ she wrote , ‘ when will this scum leave us so that we can lead a happy life ? ’ but apart from these references to the @entity50 , what is remarkable about the letters is that they make so little mention of @entity0 ’s murderous day job			1
the letters show no sense of remorse or regret			1
what they do reveal is that @entity0 displayed what some psychiatrists call ‘ doubling ’ , in which people are able to commit extraordinarily evil acts while all the time believing themselves to be essentially good , or in @entity0 ’s own self - deluded word , ‘ decent ’			0
the letter that captures this best is a short one			0
it simply states : ‘ i ’m off to @entity16			0
kisses , yours , @entity303			0
’ for the head of the @entity47 , heading off to @entity16 was no more remarkable than a day trip to visit a regional branch of the office or a factory floor			0
the notion that @entity0 , despite ordering a genocide , could have remained ' decent ' , is clearly absurd , but as the letters show , the @entity47 leader continued to believe himself to be a loving family man			1

at first glance , letters read like those sent by a businessman to his wife
but they are written by one of the most notorious mass murderers in history whose ' business ' was to orchestrate the killings of @entity50 and ' undesirables '
