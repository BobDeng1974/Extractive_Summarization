by @entity0 nowadays , gadgets and equipment are becoming increasingly complex and technical , but scientists have proved when it comes to microscopy - less is more			0
@entity7 is an origami - based print - and-fold optical microscope that can be assembled from a single sheet of paper			1
there are 30 versions , each built with varying filters and stage configurations designed to look for specific diseases , such as malaria			1
the @entity7 , pictured , was created by @entity19 and all the components and lenses are embedded into a single sheet of paper			1
the 30 versions are each built with varying filters and stage configurations , designed to look for specific diseases , such as malaria a designer recently created a $ 10 ( £ 6 ) diy microscope using wood , glass and a smartphone			1
by fitting a block of wood with a plate of plexiglass and the lens from a laser pointer , the design lets users make a microscope with 175x magnification for an @entity40			2
once the project is completed , the smartphone can be used to take photos of things as small as the nuclei of plant cells as well as for macro photography projects			0
the assembly of the rig requires basic @entity51 skills , including the use of a drill , as well as a few nuts and bolts			0
for example , malaria samples require a higher level of fluorescent filters			0
@entity7 was designed by @entity60 , a research group in the @entity61 at @entity19			1
all the components , including micro optics , are embedded into the sheet of paper			2
there are three stages - the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask holding stage			0
once folded , there is room to place a sample slide , before these built - in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x			2
it can accommodate standard glass slides , 3 - inches ( 75mm ) long , by 1 inch ( 25mm ) wide , but @entity78 said the kits come with plastic slides to improve safety			0
there are three stages in the paper - the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask holding stage			2
once folded , there is room to place a standard glass sample slide before these built - in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x these are a selection of images captured by the @entity7 including ( pictured left to right ) @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 and @entity102			1
the @entity7 can accommodate standard glass slides , but also come with plastic slides the paper the @entity7 is built into does n’t feature instructions ; instead it has a colour - coded key that helps anyone , speaking any language to build the @entity7			1
during a @entity112 demonstration , @entity78 stood on the @entity7 and threw it around to prove how rugged it is , and because it is portable , a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface			0
this diagram explains how @entity60 was able to make the @entity7 so affordable			0
each of the parts , listed in the table in the top left - hand corner , costs less than $ 50 ( 30p )			0
this image also reveals how the different components fit within the paper a resolution test , made using the @entity7 , shows a micron in the left - hand image and two micron beads in the right image			1
researchers claim the @entity7 can be stood on and because it is portable , a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface since the goal is to strip out all the complexity , @entity78 said each specific foldscope provides one kind of imaging capability : either bright - field , reflected light , dark - field , polarization , fluorescence and projection microscopy			2
each microscope also has a fixed magnification and corresponding resolution optimised for the application			0
the researchers are recruiting 10,000 beta users to test the microscopes in a variety of settings before looking to manufacture it on a wider scale .			1

@entity7 is a print - and-fold optical microscope assembled from paper
it can provide more than 2,000x magnification and *weighs* less than 8.8g
the origami - based design was created by @entity19
all the components and lenses are embedded into a sheet of paper
each version is built with varying filters designed to look for specific diseases , such as malaria
the researchers are recruiting 10,000 beta users to test the microscopes
they will then look to manufacture the scopes on a wider scale
