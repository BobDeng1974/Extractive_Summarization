by @entity0 published : 15:32 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 9 november 2012 border chiefs were today accused of ‘ camouflaging ’ the true scale of an immigration backlog that was ‘ spiralling out of control			2
’ the total number of immigration and asylum cases which have not been processed by the @entity9 now stands at more than 300,000 - the equivalent of a city the size of @entity13 - or the entire population of @entity15 , the @entity5 said			1
and it has also emerged that the @entity9 is set to grant an ‘ amnesty ’ to some 80,000 migrants as it struggles with a spiralling backlog of immigration cases			1
out of control : more than 300,000 immigration and asylum cases have not been processed by the @entity9 @entity24 , the committee ’s chairman , yesterday demanded bosses at @entity9 ‘ get a grip ’ on the scale of the backlog - and accused them of trying to disguise the problems from the public			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ entering the world of the @entity9 is like falling through the looking glass			1
‘ the closer we look the more backlogs we find , their existence obscured by opaque names such as the ‘ migration refusal pool ’ and the ‘ controlled archive ’			0
‘ @entity9 must adopt a transparent and robust approach to tackling this problem instead of creating new ways of camouflaging backlogs			1
‘ they need to get a grip			0
’ ' @entity46 ' : @entity24 demanded bosses work on reducing the scale of the backlog mr @entity24 added : ‘ there are now about the same number of cases awaiting resolution by @entity9 as there are people living in @entity15			1
‘ the backlog is spiralling out of control			0
’ the @entity9 is set to write off around 80,000 cases where they have been unable to track missing migrants for more than six years			1
the cases are what remains from nearly half a million found abandoned in boxes at the @entity64 in 2006 in a major scandal			2
the controlled archive was created to hold what remains of @entity69 ’s asylum backlog			0
it was intended to hold cases that had not been concluded , so they could be re-opened if the person was found			2
since then @entity9 officials have been tracking them down - but recently admitted they would abandon those they could n’t find			1
in september , @entity9 chief executive @entity77 said it was ‘ not in the best interests of taxpayers ’ to carry on looking for them , and the cases would be closed			1
around 80,000 are expected to be written off in the @entity82			2
the committee said they were ‘ concerned ’ that the closure of the 80,000 files would result in ‘ a significant number of people being granted effective amnesty in the @entity89 , irrespective of the merits of their case			1
’ at the end of june this year , the @entity9 had a total of 302,064 cases outstanding , today ’s report shows			1
that includes 25,000 current asylum cases , 3,500 current immigration cases , and 95,000 archived cases			2
worryingly , the numbers within the @entity102 reached 174,057 - a rise of 24,057 in just three months			0
the pool is made up of legal migrants whose work or student visas have expired and who can not be found			0
the @entity9 has awarded a £ 30million contract to outsourcing firm @entity110 to help track them down			1
it began work at the end of october			0
' not fit for purpose ' : former home secretary @entity114 thought the immigration system was not operating as it should six years ago also within the backlog are 3,954 foreign criminals who can not be deported and have been released on bail by the courts			0
overall , the backlog grew by nine per cent in the three months to june this year			0
six years ago the asylum backlog scandal prompted then home secretary @entity114 to brand the immigration system ‘ not fit for purpose ’			0
border officials claim that in many of the cases which remain the individuals will have left the country			1
but the @entity129 said they were ‘ not convinced that the agency ’s limited checking regime will have picked up all of the applicants who remain in the country ’			1
‘ for this reason we are concerned that the final checks made on these cases should be thorough and that they should not be rushed to meet an artificial deadline			0
’ of the asylum archive cases that have been processed , fewer than one in ten have been removed			0
more than 180,000 have been given the right to stay in the country , while just 41,300 have been kicked out or left voluntarily			2
immigration minister @entity141 said : ‘ this report raises some legitimate concerns but we are taking robust action and it is working			0
‘ every day it gets harder to live illegally in the @entity89 - we are tracking people down and taking action against them			2
we are restricting access to benefits , free healthcare and financial products , and businesses can be fined up to £ 10,000 for every illegal worker they employ			0
‘ we are winning more deportation cases in the courts , exceeding visa processing targets and have introduced interviews to test whether foreign students are genuine - all of which are praised in this report			0

total number of *unprocessed* cases stands at more than 300,000
and , @entity9 is set to grant ' amnesty ' to 80,000 migrants
border officials claim that in many cases , people will have left the country
but *mps* remain *unconvinced* and say action needs to be taken
