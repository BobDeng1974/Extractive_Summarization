multi-millionaire hedge fund boss @entity0 who handed £ 600,000 to the @entity1 a multi-millionaire hedge fund boss who handed £ 600,000 to the @entity1 , also stands to cash in from the privatisation of @entity5 services			1
@entity0 was unveiled last week as the generous benefactor who has become the party ’s fourth largest donor over the past three years			1
@entity9 , who has had at least one private meeting with him , has attacked the conservatives for being ‘ the party of @entity14 hedge funds ’ , the exclusive part of @entity16 where mr @entity0 ’s firm is based			1
and yesterday it emerged that mr @entity0 ’s company , @entity19 , advises a fund with a £ 10million stake in @entity22 , an @entity23 private healthcare giant which has run @entity5 - funded gp surgeries and is bidding for health service contracts			1
@entity27 @entity26 accused mr @entity9 of being a ‘ hypocrite ’ for taking his money after @entity1 have hit out at @entity5 ‘ privatisation ’ under the @entity31 and claimed they would prevent it if they win office			2
@entity22 @entity34 , its arm in this country , has run a number of @entity39 surgeries over the past few years			1
but the firm was fined tens of millions of dollars in the @entity23 for allegations it over-charged patients			0
it is also bidding for other @entity5 work including a controversial £ 1.2billion contract for cancer and end - of - life care in @entity49 and @entity50 on @entity51 , described as the health service ’s biggest ever privatisation			2
the deal - for which a number of other private companies including @entity58 ’s @entity57 are also bidding - has been opposed by @entity1 ’s @entity59 who said all private contracts should be halted until after the @entity61			2
the @entity62 , managed by mr @entity0 ’s firm , is based in the @entity64 , a secretive tax haven where investors can protect their identities and can avoid paying tax on the hedge fund ’s profits			1
there is no suggestion mr @entity0 - who has said he is domiciled in the @entity34 - or his investors have avoided tax			2
@entity27 mps have accused @entity9 of being a ‘ hypocrite ’ for taking money from hedge fund boss @entity0 mr @entity0 told the @entity78 it might seem ‘ a bit odd ’ for a hedge fund manager to support @entity1 but he believed that ‘ everyone should contribute to society and that those who are lucky enough to earn a lot should contribute more			1
’ last week @entity1 faced allegations it had tried to cover up his identity , after it emerged a newspaper had first asked about his identity several months ago			0
he has given £ 591,800 since 2012			0
parties are required to identify all donors who have given more than £ 7,500 , but because only the person ’s name is given it can be difficult to identify those with common names such as mr @entity0			1
the party issued a statement from him last week , saying : ‘ there is no mystery			0
this ‘ @entity0 is me ’			0
i am a born and bred @entity16 , who also happens to be a hedge fund manager			0
and i am proud to support the @entity1			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ we are grateful to people from all walks of life who support the @entity1 and our better plan			0
unlike @entity109 and the @entity27 who increasingly rely on the money of an exclusive group of donors – the same people who they have rewarded with tax breaks - @entity9 will enter @entity117 owing nothing to anybody			0
