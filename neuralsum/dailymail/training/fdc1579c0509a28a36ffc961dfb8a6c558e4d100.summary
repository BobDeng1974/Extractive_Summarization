it is an astonishing image that shows the beauty and majesty of the @entity3			1
a climber and filmmaker has created the stunning mosaic of images to show the effect of climate change on the the area surrounding @entity11			1
the 477 individual images that make up the gigapixel image of the @entity14 were captured by @entity15 during the spring of 2012 , from the @entity17 viewpoint near @entity11			1
use your mouse to navigate around the image below , and click on the hand under the green boxes to jump to key areas ( please note , this requires @entity26 so will not work on @entity27 or @entity28 ) @entity29 , one of the team who captured the 477 images that make up the panorama - and they say they have thousands more ready for a larger version to see more glacier images , visit @entity38 web site			1
' the @entity40 is clearly visible here , and one can easily see the hustle and bustle of @entity44 below ' , he told @entity45			0
the incredible image is made up of 477 images taken with a 300 - millimeter lens			2
@entity15 and his team stitched them together to create one massive image that users can zoom in and out of			1
' it 's just extraordinary and we 're so excited by that image , and people love clicking on things and zooming in , ' he said			2
' we want to tell the bigger story of climate change in the area , and we are working with @entity61 and the @entity62 on this			1
' the team eventually hope to develop a far larger version of the image so detailed users can actually zoom inside tents at base camp ' just 1/100th of our imagery is on the site , and the storytelling possibilities are incredible - people love to move things , ' said @entity15 , who has climbed @entity11 five times			1
' it started out as a simple concept , and every time we visit we find out more - this is not even the tip of the iceberg , we want to take people all over the mountain with 120,000 pictures from a helicopter in the region			2
' we are building this with @entity61 , and we could soon be able to combine the old and new pictures so people can virtually ' swipe ' images to see how they looked in the past			2
in 1865 , @entity11 was given its official @entity99 name by the @entity62 upon a recommendation by @entity101 , the @entity102 surveyor general of @entity103			0
@entity101 named the mountain after his predecessor in the post , sir @entity107			0
it has become a mecca for climbers , and has two main climbing routes , the southeast ridge from @entity113 and the north ridge from @entity115			0
the southeast ridge is technically easier and was the route used by @entity118 and @entity119 in 1953 when they reached the summit for the first time			0
the team has also been working with the @entity62 in @entity124 to create a series of ' before and after ' photographs showing the effect of climate change since 1921			1
' it 's a very interesting time to be looking at the mountain , ' said @entity15			2
' after a while i became interested in climate change , and how it was affecting the area			1
' out of that came the idea for matching photography with @entity62 to show the first images from @entity11 with current ones			2
' the team now plans to combine the two projects into a vast interactive image of the area so detailed viewers can actually zoom into camps of climbers and see inside tents			1
' we are hoping to launch the next version in june next year , and this is really just a placeholder for what we want to do			0
' you 'll be able to zoom into tents , and swipe pictures to see how the view has changed over time			0
' @entity15 has spent most of his career working in mountain areas			2
' when i was 23 i wanted to be a mountaineer after seeing the picture from the top of @entity11 taken by sir @entity118			0
' i first went to @entity3 in 1979 to climb @entity161 near to @entity11 , which is over 22,000 feet high			0
' i was also becoming interested in photography , so for the past 33 years have been on 5 @entity11 ascents , including the first live broadcast , and first @entity166 film from @entity11			0
he also revealed he is currently working with @entity169 films on a movie set on @entity11			0
the @entity3 region seen the in map , showing the major landmarks , including the @entity175 route taken by by @entity118 and @entity119 in 1953 , which is now littered with the bodies of climbers then and now : the @entity178 in the @entity179 photographed in 1921 , left , and in 2009 by the @entity38 team			1
they hope the before and after images , which will eventually be incorporated into the interactive map , will raise awareness of climate change in the area			1
the @entity187 in 1921 , left , and in 2008 , right			0
the @entity188 in 1921 the @entity188 in 2007			0

astonishing image was created from 477 photographs stitched together
created by filmmaker @entity15 and *nonprofit* *organisation* @entity38 to *highlight* the effect of climate change on the area
team also produced stunning ' then and now ' pictures to show the effect climate change on the area since 1921
working with @entity61 on even more detailed version
