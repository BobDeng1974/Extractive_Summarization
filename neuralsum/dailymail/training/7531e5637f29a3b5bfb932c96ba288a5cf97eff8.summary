@entity0 has confirmed how wise @entity1 is not to fall for the bait of appearing on the great man ’s undercard after being dumped from the big fight itself			1
at his first media conference since announcing @entity10 as his opponent in @entity12 on may 3 , the world ’s pound - for - pound king has made this very clear : ‘ i choose who i want to fight , when i want			2
’ @entity0 had tried to goad @entity1 into fighting his protegee @entity16 that night , hinting that he would give our young man from @entity19 his big - bucks shot if he won			1
announcement : @entity0 will fight @entity10 on may 3 at @entity22 in @entity12 while that would have boosted @entity0 ’s pay - per - view revenue , @entity1 nursed serious doubts that he would be @entity27 ’s next @entity26 come september , win or lose against @entity16			1
after all , one promise had already been broken			2
so @entity1 , having lost almost a year waiting for @entity29 in gloves , will go his own way this spring			1
perhaps as early as this week , he will name a comeback opponent and a date			2
that will not be @entity35 in the @entity36 , either , since that would not improve his chances of ever fighting @entity0			1
@entity1 is looking for a marquee win in @entity40			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , continues to exercise his box - office power over his sport			1
in the pipeline : @entity1 is looking for a marquee win in @entity40 , not a @entity36 showdown with @entity35 does what he wants : @entity0 ignored his own poll about who to fight next that privilege has been hard won but by hand - picking the likes of @entity10 – whose rough - hewn style is likely to suit him – he risks accusations of evading rivals who might have the speed to pose a different problem			1
‘ i do n’t duck anyone , ’ says @entity0			1
personally , since he is the best in the world and knows it , i believe him			2
but we are approaching the point where he may have to prove it			2
if , next month , @entity63 avenges that scandalous decision given to @entity66 the pressure will crank up yet again for the long - deferred super-fight between the @entity63 and the @entity68			0
@entity0 , having instigated his @entity70 poll asking fans to vote whether he should fight @entity1 or @entity10 , then ignored the result			1
but at some point , for credibility ’s sake , he may have to let the public choose his opponent for him			0
different paths : @entity1 rejected the chance to fight on @entity16 on @entity0 's undercard warrior : @entity10 pushed @entity1 all the way when they fought in @entity12 in 2010 the @entity84 made a tasty comeback at the weekend			1
@entity86 served up a timely reminder that no boxer should be consigned to the slops bucket just because he loses the odd fight			2
what matters is how he responds to that setback when he returns to the ring			2
back with a bang : @entity95 beat @entity96 on saturday in @entity12 @entity86 , having been bewildered last september by @entity0 ’s most recent master class , resurfaced in @entity12 with a dynamic performance against a fellow @entity99 considered so dangerous that he revels in the nickname @entity101 – @entity102			1
@entity96 never got close to putting the bite on @entity86 , despite a couple of quibbles nagging at the event			0
in an echo of @entity109 1 , the referee was booed for a tenth round stoppage which many in the crowd at the @entity22 deemed premature			0
just as the @entity113 backed their official @entity114 , so the @entity115 is defending @entity116			0
although @entity86 was well behind on the cards , in contrast to @entity119 who was leading @entity120 , the argument was similar : do we want one punch too few , or one punch too many ? it is a fine line which the referees have to tread but , in principle , better to stop it a mite early than end up in hospital later that night			0
less acceptable was @entity86 ’s failure to make the light - middleweight limit			0
he said he could have squeezed off the extra poundage had it been a title fight but really that only made it more cynical			2
too many boxers are hitting the scales too heavy these days and that in itself hints at another medical risk			0
rather than dehydrate to make the weight , should n’t they be moving up to a more natural division ? the consolation for @entity96 was that he picked up an extra $ 100,000 deducted from the @entity86 purse			0
nevertheless , @entity86 made a statement as important for boxing as for himself			0
most champions are defined by how they come back from losing their titles			0
the great boxers of the past , with such rare exceptions as @entity147 and @entity148 , had defeats on their records , @entity151 , @entity152 and the two @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 , among them			0
response : @entity86 bounced back from his disappointing loss to @entity0 by beating @entity96 yet of late it has become a crime to lose a fight			1
that misconception keeps growing the longer @entity0 - 45 - 0 and counting - goes without suffering his first defeat			1
@entity86 , fully restored now to world title contention , has dished up a powerful defence against that nonsense			0
expect @entity63 and @entity1 to do the same , shortly			1
@entity167 – anointed by his coach the great @entity168 as his successor to the throne of @entity172 boxing – has been given added incentive to win his world title eliminator against @entity175 in @entity176 next month			1
@entity180 , after impressively retaining his @entity178 super-bantamweight crown against former champion @entity179 in @entity12 on saturday night , pronounced himself eager to do the same against @entity167			1
that would appear to put @entity167 just one victory away from his first world title bid , possibly at a sold - out stadium in @entity176 in september			1
if so , it should be an @entity187 cracker			0
clash : @entity167 ( left ) could be just one fight away from a crack at @entity178 champion @entity180 ( right ) when @entity151 came to @entity191 in 1977 he struck up a friendship with a @entity194 fan which endures to this day			1
the @entity196 never forgot the courtesy and attention he received from @entity199 when he visited @entity200 to have his marriage to former wife @entity202 blessed at a local mosque			0
the pair kept in touch and three years later @entity151 not only invited @entity199 to meet him in @entity206 but invited him to stay at his mansion			0
ovation : former world heavyweight champion @entity151 touches down in @entity191 in 1977 @entity194 nation : a young admirer gives @entity151 a kiss on his arrival in @entity191 much more recently , @entity199 travelled from @entity191 to be a guest at @entity151 ’s 70th birthday dinner in @entity215			2
that relationship offers a touching insight into the caring side of @entity151 ’s nature and now @entity199 has put pen to paper for a new book			0
by his own admission , @entity199 is not a writer but this memoir adds a different dimension to the @entity151 story and is worth the read			0

@entity0 ignored his own poll to decide who he should fight next
@entity1 was offered a chance to fight on @entity0 v @entity235
@entity19 fighter is looking for a big win in @entity40 , not a battle with @entity35
' @entity95 returned to the ring with a bang on saturday
@entity167 could be one win from a show at @entity178 champion @entity247
