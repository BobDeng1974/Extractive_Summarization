@entity0 , 17 , who had autism , was found hanged at his home in @entity4 after receiving a spam email saying he had viewed indecent images a 17 - year - old with autism hanged himself after opening a scam email which appeared to be from police claiming he had downloaded indecent images and demanding £ 100			1
@entity0 , an a-level student from @entity14 , @entity4 , likely did n't understand that the message was fake because of his learning difficulty , a coroner said			1
police say it will be almost impossible to trace the fraudsters behind the ' crude ' email , but believe it may have originated from abroad			1
the 17 - year - old was found hanged at his home by his mother @entity22 who has since launched a campaign to make children more aware of the dangers from internet scams			1
battling through tears , she told the hearing at @entity29 her son had been a ' happy boy			0
' she added : ' he was generally happy and had just started new friendship circles and was enjoying himself , ” she told the coroner			2
' he did n’t seem to have any worries known to me			0
i do n’t think he really understood			0
he did suffer from autism			0
i ’m not sure he would have really understood the implications of what he was doing			0
' he would n’t have done anything to upset myself or his sister , not deliberately			2
' ms @entity41 told the hearing how , after finding his body , she had run screaming into the street			0
the noise attracted a neighbour , truck driver @entity48 , who came to help , and called the emergency services			0
police seized the teenager ’s laptop , along with a note he had left			1
coroner @entity55 said : ' it seems that from examining the computer that there appeared to be some sort of scam on it			1
' he had inadvertently clicked onto this and it seemed to be , according to the police , " a poor attempt at blackmail			2
" it ( his autism ) may have meant he took it very seriously			2
' people with the developmental disability often do not understand sarcasm or lies and take things very literally			0
detective sergeant @entity74 , investigating the scam , said it was very difficult to trace those responsible but that police believe it originated abroad			2
it was thought @entity0 received a spam email which demanded money and downloaded a virus onto his computer			1
the message came with a @entity86 logo , despite the fact that he lived in @entity4 , which is served by @entity88			1
a coroner said that because of his autism , @entity0 likely took the message seriously and became distressed , despite police describing it as ' a poor attempt at fraud ' the scam wrongly claimed indecent images had been found in @entity0 ’s possession and he would have to pay up to prevent the ' police ' taking things further			1
fearing causing his mother and sister @entity100 distress , the traumatised young boy , who was studying his a-levels at @entity105 ’ school , instead took his own life , the inquest heard			0
a post-mortem investigation showed the youngster had died from asphyxia as a result of hanging			0
' @entity0 was subjected to a scam on the internet , a threatening , fake police link that was asking for money , ' his mother said in a statement			1
' he would have taken it literally because of his autism and he did n’t want to upset @entity100 or me			2
' the internet is an amazing thing , but it can also be dangerous and i want parents to make sure their children are aware of this sort of scam , especially autistic children , because they will not understand			0
' @entity128 was a very loving boy			0
he had a quirky sense of humour , and was just starting to develop his confidence and in many ways he was a typical teenager , despite being autistic			2
@entity0 's mother , @entity22 , has now set up a campaign to teach teenagers about the dangers of internet scams ' he was a sensible , calm , kind and gentle boy - those are all words people are using about him , but his friends have also told me they will remember him as a ‘ crazy dancer			1
' @entity0 , a keen football fan , had attended a mainstream school , despite his autism diagnosis , and the family had been planning to travel to @entity147 together to celebrate his 18th birthday			1
recording an open verdict into @entity0 ’s death , coroner @entity55 said : ' taking all this evidence into account , i am satisfied that on the 6th of august you found him at his home in the hallway			1
' i ’m not satisfied that he necessarily understood the implications that he would die from it			0
although he undertook that action himself , his intention is not clear from the evidence			0
' it ’s what we call an open verdict			0
i ’m sure and hope you will remember him for the better moments of his life than for the way that he died			0
' after @entity0 ’s death , a @entity170 page was set up called ' @entity171 in @entity172 of @entity0			1
' a statement said : ' on august 6 2014 @entity0 , received a fake email scam from @entity86 ( @entity175 ) informing him that he had been visiting illegal websites , which also generated a virus locking his laptop			1
' he was asked to pay a sum of £ 100 or face being prosecuted			1
these emails are sent on headed paper from police authorities on both a national and global basis			2
' this message was designed to look extremely convincing due to the official police headed paper			1
' @entity0 , who suffered from @entity186 , was so distressed by the accusation and by the demand for money sadly took his own life			1
' this page is set up for a plea for more action to be taken against such websites and for the prosecution of those responsible for them			2
' also to raise awareness of the dangers these sites present , not only to children but also to older people and many others may be vulnerable to this sort of extortion			0
' we must do more to stop this , please share this to raise awareness			0
