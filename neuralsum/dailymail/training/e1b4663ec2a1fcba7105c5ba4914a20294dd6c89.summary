a plan to build a modern - day crematorium next to the gas chambers and ovens of a @entity5 death camp has sparked a storm of protest from @entity9 organisations around the world			1
authorities in @entity12 in eastern @entity13 want to construct the crematorium near to the @entity16 camp where 80,000 people were put to death during the @entity19 the camp was captured nearly intact because the advance of the @entity22 @entity21 was so rapid it prevented the @entity23 from destroying it before liberation			1
death camp : tens of thousands of people - including many @entity9 - were killed by the @entity23 at @entity16 horror : the bodies of those who died were incinerated in the camp 's crematorium tragic history : the memorial at the entry gate within the concentration camp tragedy : barbed wire fences trapped the prisoners into the camp , while armed guards kept watch for escape attempts @entity16 remains the best preserved @entity5 concentration camp of the @entity45 with intact gas chambers , crematoria and barracks			1
it is a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of thousands of visitors a year			2
but now @entity12 , which has no crematorium for modern day funerals , has deeply upset @entity55 's @entity9 with its insensitive plan to build one near @entity57			1
' if people see smoke rising from a crematorium chimmney they will think it comes from @entity16 , ' said @entity62 of the @entity9 community of @entity12 , the city from where the @entity23 directed the murder of 2.4 million @entity9 in a string of death camps in @entity5 - occupied @entity13			1
' it can not and must not be built anywhere near this hallowed ground that is strewn with the ashes of the dead			0
' reign of terror : a watch tower looks over the site of the @entity5 prison camp @entity12 city council is due to decide the planning application from a company called @entity78 before friday			0
@entity79 , mayor of the city of @entity12 , and authorities overseeing the @entity16 memorial site which includes a museum , want the company to find a different location for its crematorium which - if allowed to go ahead - would be barely 750 yards away from the place where the @entity23 incinerated their victims			1
@entity12 says it needs a crematorium as more and more catholics shun burials			0
but the rising tide of anger at the spot which has been earmarked may mean further delays in getting one built			0
' there should be no crematorium in this area because of the one that is already there , ' said @entity105 , the former director of the @entity57			0
' @entity16 is known around the world as a memorial to the victims of @entity109			0
it should not be shrouded in the smoke of burning people again , ' read a letter to the local paper signed by @entity9 groups while @entity117 leader @entity116 , himself a @entity45 survivor , said ; ' the idea is disgusting , that a company wants to build such a thing near holy ground dedicated to the memory of people who suffered incredible cruelties			2
' some locals , however , have backed the project , saying they want to live in a ' normal ' city unburdened by the @entity5 past			0
@entity16 began life as a concentration camp for @entity9 and @entity22 pows , but began exterminating inmates soon after opening in 1941			1
@entity136 discovery : soldiers from the @entity22 @entity21 look at the ovens at @entity16 , following the camp 's liberation in 1944 @entity16 functioned as sorting and storage depot for property and valuables taken from the victims at the killing centers in @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 , all in @entity13			1
victims at @entity16 were forced into gas chambers that were pumped full with the exhaust from captured @entity22 tank engines			1
the crematoria next door still has ash remains of victims in its ovens			0
the @entity23 built hundreds of concentration camps across occupied @entity55 before and during @entity19			2
the two largest groups prisoners , both numbering in the millions , were @entity13 jews and @entity22 prisoners of war			2
there were also large numbers of @entity166 , ethnic @entity13 , political prisoners , homosexuals , people with disabilities , @entity172 , catholic clergy , @entity175 intellectuals and others			0
western @entity177 aviators were also sent to concentration camps as spies .			0
