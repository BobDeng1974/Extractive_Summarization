by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 20 august 2013 the newly - released biopic of @entity3 founder @entity2 , entitled @entity2 , has resulted in a furious exchange between @entity3 co-founder @entity5 and the film 's lead , @entity8			1
@entity8 plays the tech visionary in the film , about which @entity5 has posted his own unsolicited review on the tech site @entity14			1
@entity5 dismissed the film , which follows @entity2 from his days as a college drop - out to the game - changing release of the @entity19 in 2001 , as ' fiction ' and accused @entity8 of being ' disingenuous '			1
scroll down to see trailer co-founder : @entity5 is not a fan of the new @entity8 biopic of the late @entity2 in character : @entity8 as @entity2 ( left ) and at a premiere of the film earlier this month ( right ) the film only opened in the @entity29 over the weekend , but has already garnered lukewarm reviews for its handling of the subject			1
' i suspect a lot of what was wrong with the film came from @entity8 's own image of @entity2 , ' wrote @entity5			1
@entity8 spent three months preparing for his role as @entity2 , including reading , watching and listening to all material about the tech visionary and even following the same extreme diet as @entity2			2
making history : @entity8 as @entity2 , left , and @entity44 as @entity5 in a scene from ' @entity2 ' early days : this shot of @entity2 and @entity5 in the garage of @entity2 ' parents ' house was taken in 1976 the actor , who has said he cried the day @entity2 died and that he ' loved a man he never knew , ' has accused @entity5 of being in the pay of another film studio which is putting out its own @entity2 movie , and said that he was ' extremely unavailable us when producing this film '			1
@entity5 responded that @entity8 's film had already been written - making his consultation unnecessary - and that he was ' turned off ' by the @entity2 script			1
@entity5 is reported to have met with @entity60 , who is adapting @entity62 ’s official biography of @entity2			2
good apples : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) founded @entity3 in 1976 along with a third man , @entity64 , whose role was glossed over in ' @entity66 ' he said @entity8 , who was also a producer on the film , must ' still be in character ' to accuse him of disparaging the film for money from another movie studio			1
1983 : @entity5 holds an @entity72 , a variation on his best - selling @entity3 ' @entity74 film would have paid me to consult , ' he wrote , ' but the @entity2 one already had a script written			1
i ca n't take that creative leadership from someone else			0
and i was turned off by the @entity2 script			0
but i still hoped for a great movie			0
' @entity5 , offended by the inference that he would slander the film for money , mentioned an important part of @entity3 history that was n't included in the film			2
' when @entity3 decided not to reward early friends who helped , i gave them large blocks of my own stock			0
and i made it possible for 80 other employees to get some stock prior to the ipo so they could participate in the wealth , ' he wrote			0
@entity5 challenged the film 's accuracy - which has also been derided by other critics - and said , ' i felt bad for many people i know well who were portrayed wrongly in their interactions with @entity2 and the company			1
' @entity5 also thinks the film was too easy on @entity2 , who is glorified as a tech genius and businessman extraordinaire from the very beginning , when he did n't necessarily possess those skills , while other players in the @entity3 story were n't given credit in the film			2
influenced : @entity5 says @entity8 's portrayal of @entity2 was colored by the actor 's own admiration for the tech entrepreneur ' the movie ends pretty much where the great @entity2 finally found product success and changed so many of our lives , ' @entity5 wrote			2
' i ’m grateful to @entity2 for his excellence in the i - era , and his contribution to my own life of enjoying great products , but this movie portrays him having had those skills in earlier times			0
' @entity5 did n't comment on how he himself was portrayed in the film ( by actor @entity44 ) , but did have praise for the performances			0
' i thought the acting throughout was good			0
i was attentive and entertained but not greatly enough to recommend the movie , ' @entity5 wrote			0
' one friend who is in the movie said he did n't want to watch fiction , so he was n't interested in seeing it			0
' @entity5 was the designer of the @entity3 computer and left @entity3 in 1987 .			0
