@entity0 has been used for years to measure whether we need to watch what we 're eating			2
but numerous professionals have come forward saying that unless you are severely overweight tracking your health and fitness through @entity0 may be redundant			1
as a result , sales of speciality scales - which measure your body composition including levels of muscle , fat and water - are soaring			1
some of these use @entity18 ( @entity18 ) technology to safely pass a signal through the body to tell you if you 're carrying too much fat , and where it 's being stored			1
but it fails to accurately assess your body fat as a muscly athlete might be classed as obese , despite carrying little or no body fat , simply because muscle is more dense - i.e. heavier - than fat			1
at the other end of the scale , a slim person with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy , despite the fact that they may be carrying excessive fat around the waistline			1
this is important because visceral fat , which lies in and around the abdomen , is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease			2
@entity55 fat secretes molecules that , among other things , lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels			0
this flaw in @entity0 is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the chart			2
personal trainers like to track your circumferential measurements ( girth measurements - waist , hips etc ) dr @entity69 , an obesity expert and medical director at @entity72 , said : ' the greatest concern is that @entity0 does n't address the critical issue of how much fat a person has in their body and where it is distributed			1
' new products and guides are fast coming out in the hope of giving more accurate and helpful measures of health based on what your weight is made up of - rather than what it totals			2
@entity90 body composition monitors , for example , can help you track your fitness , measure body composition and lose excess fat using @entity18			1
instead of simply reading your overall body mass and calculating your weight , they measure statistics such as weight , body fat percentage , muscle mass , body water , basal metabolic rate and visceral fat			1
they 've just brought out the @entity105 , one of the first speciality @entity18 scales created for the home rather than the gym , for £ 45			1
a spokesperson for @entity90 says : ' it 's incredibly important to monitor your body composition when losing weight			0
when you exercise more or start dieting , your body composition will change , even if your weight stays the same			0
' low - calorie crash diets may produce speedy results , but the weight loss will most likely be from water and even healthy , lean muscle tissue			0
they can force your body into starvation mode , storing body fat rather than burning it - so even if you lose weight your body fat could increase			2
the @entity105 , @entity18 scales created for the home , come in at £ 45 personal trainer @entity131 of @entity132 has his own ways of making sure a client is making progress			1
he says : ' weighing yourself does have its place , but ca n't be seen as the only measurement to look out for			0
' it does n't provide us with the whole story , not taking into account hydration levels , lean body mass , how healthy you are , and even though they weigh the same , muscle looks far better than fat ! ' likewise , bio-electrical impedance analysis still is n't a great tool in terms of accuracy			1
' as a current is used to determine your fat percentage it will look for the easiest way out of your body , so a lot of these machines where you only stand on , or hold , miss whole sections ! ' one day they could give a good reading , and on another you could get a bad reading			2
hydration levels will also reduce accuracy of results			0
' i like to use a number of different metrics when testing how well someone is doing			0
' they include body fat , circumferential measurements - girth measurements - waist , hips - skin folds , how your clothes fit and your weight			1
' but the easiest and most noticeable metric will be before and after photographs - and for most of you , how you look is probably the reason why you 're doing this ! ' @entity180 are your best bet but are expensive , a few places in @entity183 do them			0
for a bit cheaper , a good @entity184 should be able to take skin fold measurements which are great , unless you 're obese ( then weight is the best tool ! )			0
' @entity131 of @entity132 ( r ) has his own ways of making sure a client is making progress the easiest and most noticeable metric will be before and after photographs - and for most of you , how you look is probably the reason why you 're doing this ! - says personal trainer @entity131 bod pods look like a giant white plastic egg that you can sit in			1
they use air displacement to work out your mass ( weight ) using very accurate electronic scales , and volume			0
from these calculations , body density and fat levels can be worked out			0
behind the seat is a moving ' diaphragm ' which varies the volume inside the front chamber			0
this is measured before and after you get in , with your body volume therefore worked out by subtraction			0
for example , if the interior air volume of the empty chamber is 400 litres , and the volume of the chamber is reduced to 350 litres with the subject inside , the body volume of the subject would be 50 litres			0
@entity180 readings are available in hospitals such as @entity224 in @entity225 and are able to work out your detailed body mass , fat mass and body volume - as well as an estimate on your own personal metabolic rate .			2

professionals say tracking your fitness through @entity0 is redundant
new products and guides hope to help us track our fitness better
scales use @entity18 pass a signal through the body
measure body fat percentage , muscle mass , body water , visceral fat
new £ 45 @entity249 are created for the home rather than the gym
but personal trainer @entity131 of @entity132 is n't *convinced*
he trusts circumferentials , how your clothes fit , and photos
