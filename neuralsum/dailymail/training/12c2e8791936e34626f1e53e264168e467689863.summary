' at professor @entity13 ’s request , the @entity2 will provide no further comment on this matter			1
' @entity47 , a sportsman [ footballer ] , his mother one of the " @entity51 " , ' mr @entity13 allegedly wrote of mr @entity9			1
' ticking all the correct boxes			0
now all we need to know is that he suffers from ' depression ' and has a disability , and he becomes the complete role model for @entity57 today			0
' in his acceptance speech , all he talked about was racism and every time he said " @entity57 " he mispronounced it			0
' ' @entity61 wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of @entity65 in the @entity66 later this year … to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all			0
' mr @entity67 told @entity68 that the exchange was a pastime ' that mocked extreme language ' , saying the comments were ' largely to one recipient with whom i have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements '			1
' @entity61 wants this [ for @entity9 to be titled @entity10 ] so he can combine it with the inclusion of @entity65 in the @entity66 later this year , ' @entity13 allegedly wrote however , @entity34 says the emails , which were allegedly sent between late 2012 and 2014 , had been sent between mr @entity13 and numerous colleagues and friends			1

@entity96 in all @entity98 chruches ; @entity99 in all @entity101 ones			0
not a woman to be seen in a sanctuary anywhere			0
and no obese fatsoes ' another email allegedly shows mr @entity13 calling a house in which an @entity107 family live ' a rubbish tip : human and material '			2
new @entity112 disputed claims by mr @entity13 that the emails were a ' whimsical linguistic game ' between himself and one recipient by releasing almost 20 of the emails that were sent between late 2012 and 2014 to numerous colleagues and friends he wrote : ' ... it is now utterly destroyed , with its contents and smashed up fabric vomited out onto [ a street ] , the pile impregnated with empty booze bottles , awaiting the @entity128 special garbage collection for trashed housing			1
' these are the people whose " ancient wisdom " , our @entity132 says , we should respect , and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before , confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them			0
' another email , it is alleged professor @entity13 called the chancellor of @entity2 as an ' appalling minx '			2
. professor @entity13 was employed at @entity2 as @entity145 in @entity146 and poetics but was suspended by the university on friday the allegations against professor @entity13 , who took charge of examining nationwide @entity152 courses , came just days after results of the @entity154 were released			1
despite claims from the @entity157 that the review is ' tainted ' , education minister @entity155 has refused to review the new curriculum for bias , according to the @entity161			0
however , a spokesperson for mr @entity155 told @entity68 : ' the minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex , race , sexual orientation or beliefs '			0
as part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum , professor @entity13 made the recommendation to reduce study into the @entity107 and @entity178 language			2
@entity2 students rallied outside the city campus on friday calling for the sacking of professor @entity13 for the racist , sexist and derogatory comments in the email exchange in one of the emails released by @entity34 on sunday , sent on april 19 2014 , mr @entity13 is alleged to complain about being sent 300 pages to read by mr @entity155 for the completion of the review			1
' and whereas the local curriculuim has the phrase ' @entity107 and @entity178 ' on virtually every one of its 300 pages , the @entity190 curriculum does not once mention native americans and has only a very slight representation of @entity196 ( which , unlike @entity198 literature , actually exists and has some distinguished productions ) , ' mr @entity13 apparently wrote			2
' [ a fellow @entity2 academic ] tells me that at her grand - daughter 's school – [ in @entity204 ] - every day begins with an acknowledgement of the orignal [ sic ] owners of the land			0
no flag - raising or national anthem - just this , every day			0
on the school 's website , it proclaims that it prides itself on its ' atheletics ' [ sic ] program			0
' if ever an education system needed a bomb under it , it 's ours			0
' they also attached a note to the @entity145 's office door which dubbed him the ' professor of bigotry ' mr @entity13 told the @entity34 his recommendations in the review were made with his ' considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play '			2
professor @entity13 said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally			2
the @entity2 suspended professor @entity13 's employment in october after initial reports that offensive emails , including one which referred to prime minister @entity61 as an ' abo lover ' , had been sent from his university account			1
@entity155 had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs but will not review the new curriculum for bias ' professor @entity13 is suspended , effective immediately , from teaching and engaging in any other @entity2 business and is precluded from attending any @entity2 campus , while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the @entity2 ’s @entity252 , ' the university said in a statement			1
' racist , sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the @entity2			2
