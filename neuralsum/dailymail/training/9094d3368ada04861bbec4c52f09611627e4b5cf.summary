by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 7 july 2013 if the hot summer days have left your feet less than fresh a revolutionary @entity2 project hopes to be the solution to all your problems			1
carbonised coffee fused into these futuristic socks promises to spell the end to stinky feet as it filters and adsorbs sweat and odour			1
@entity14 ( @entity14 ) , who designed the garment , hope for £ 20,000 of funding but with more than two weeks to go until the opportunity to back them ends , they have already surpassed their goal four times over			1
carbonised coffee granules in these futuristic socks attract odour particles for fresh feet @entity14 ' previous inventions include the £ 65 @entity27 dress shirt , a revolutionary garment that got widespread recognition			1
the shirt is made using anti-microbial fabric with moisture wicking qualities and @entity34 heat - regulation technology			2
the high - tech firm have now turned their hands to socks for their latest sartorial innovation			2
@entity39 , the firm once again evoke ancient @entity40 for the name of their invention			0
the garment comes with a promise of cool and comfortable feet thanks in part to coffee			1
the socks are made from a mix of cotton , recycled polyester and carbonised coffee which filters and absorbs sweat and odor to keep feet cool			1
mos say that this is exactly how a @entity58 water filter works			0
carbonised coffee ' attracts molecules ' ( composed mostly of carbon ) with its spongy structure			1
the trepped molecules are released in the wash , ready for a whole new dose of smells the next time they 're worn			0
the high - tech socks are part of a @entity2 project reliant on funding the coffee is reclaimed from coffee roasting factories and shops and then subjected to a pharmaceutical process to remove oils and that coffee smell			1
it is then infused into the company 's recycled polyester yarns			0
@entity39 has undergone lab tests that @entity14 claims showed it to be three times more effective at absorbing smells than regular cotton			2
the firm used 3d strain analysis to visualise how the skin stretches in @entity91 and adjusts , so that the sock does n't have to bend and stretch to accommodate foot movements as conventional socks do			0
they also used pressure mapping to locate points that require extra support , a similar to technology used in the production of customised orthotics			0
this technique combined with thermal imaging identified hot spots and help improve ventilation			0
they ' hope to provide new levels of comfort that were not previously possible '			0
pressure mapping combined with thermal imaging identified hot spots and help improve ventilation pressure mapping research has shown mos how and where extra comfort is needed the firm say the socks are durable , easily passing the eight month stress - test			0
@entity120 will be outsourced to specialist textile mills that use techniques such as robotic knitting , which @entity14 says is like 3d printing but for knitwear			2
@entity14 has poured as much clothing technology into @entity127 as it can , even down to the robotic knitting machines it uses to make the coffee socks			2
robotic knitting machines are like 3d printers for clothing , and offers the same level of precision and customisation industry 3d printers provide			0
the sock project is now fully funded on @entity2 four times over , so the @entity14 team 's goal to product the garment in a variety of colours other than black is most likely to become a reality			1
the @entity39 performance dress socks , a ' @entity147 for your feet ' , will come in medium and large and will cost £ 18 for two pairs			1
the project is still open for funding on @entity2 for another 15 days			2
strain analysis maps the movement of the skin , and how clothing reacts when it 's stretched over our foot			0

@entity14 have invented a sock that keeps feet fresh
carbonised coffee ' attracts molecules ' like sponge , ' just like @entity147 '
*caffeine* - infused garment features on @entity2 to raise funds
*investors* clearly have faith as they have *quadrupled* £ *20k* *pledge* goal
