@entity0 is under fire for euthanizing four dogs on @entity136 *'s* despite claims they promised to keep dogs until they had homes
the dogs were part of a group of 27 animals taken in from an owner who some felt may have become a serial hoarder
a group worked *closely* with the owner to let them know they dogs would find homes , and that group feels the shelter has betrayed them
the group says they were promised 10 days to work on finding the dogs homes from when they were taken in on december 30
homes were found for the dogs on january 5 but it was too late by then
the city has launched an investigation into what happened and said they will share their findings
