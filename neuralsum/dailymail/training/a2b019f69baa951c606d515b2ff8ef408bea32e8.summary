this weekend 's @entity2 action begins with the small matter of the @entity4 on saturday lunchtime , a fiery fixture made even more important with @entity6 and @entity7 both battling for fourth place			1
@entity6 will undoubtedly call on the in - form @entity9 at @entity11 , but another of @entity13 's strikers can also stake a strong claim for a starting place against the @entity16			1
@entity17 , who almost joined @entity18 on transfer deadline day , has scored more goals in north @entity22 derbies than any other player , beating the likes of @entity7 legend @entity25 and former @entity6 favourite @entity26			1
but , having netted 10 goals in the fixture - eight of which have come in the @entity2 - the statistics suggest that @entity13 should at least consider a recall for the out - of - favour forward			1
@entity17 , who played for @entity7 between 2006 and 2009 , scored six top - flight goals against his current employers and another two in cup competitions before leaving for big - spending @entity51 in a Â£ 25million deal			1
he joined the @entity16 ' arch rivals @entity6 on loan two years later and made the move permanent in 2012 , scoring twice against @entity58 's men during that time			2
his last goal in the north @entity22 derby came at the @entity35 in november 2012 when he opened the scoring before being sent off in the 18th minute for a wild tackle on @entity63			2
@entity7 went on to win the game 5 - 2			0
@entity17 's form in the fixture means that he is also the top scorer when it comes to @entity2 games only , beating former @entity16 midfielder @entity69 by a single strike			1
@entity71 man @entity17 celebrates his first goal for @entity6 against rivals @entity7 in february 2012 @entity69 , pictured scoring against @entity6 in april 2004 , scored seven goals in north @entity22 derbies @entity26 scores one of his five goals against @entity7 by beating goalkeeper @entity79 in 2013 the @entity80 bagged seven goals during his six - year stint under @entity58 , two more than his compatriot @entity25 , @entity83 star @entity26 and former team - mate @entity84			1
five players have hit four goals in the fervent fixture - @entity87 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
the form of @entity7 's players in front of goal has meant @entity6 have kept just one clean sheet in their last 32 @entity2 north @entity22 derbies , a 0 - 0 draw at @entity11 in february 2009			1
defender @entity100 saw red in the first half that day but the @entity16 held on to claim a point , despite the best efforts of @entity104 on his second debut for the club			0
that match was one of 18 @entity2 games between the two clubs to have ended in a draw , making it the most drawn fixture in the history of the competition			2
@entity58 , who took charge at @entity116 in 1996 , has overseen the majority of those games but there has been notably less stability at @entity6 , who have had 12 permanent managers during the @entity80 's reign			0
@entity6 's last clean sheet against @entity7 came in february 2009 as @entity100 ( right ) saw red @entity125 ( left ) tussles with @entity127 in 1995 - the last year @entity6 finished above @entity7 @entity6 have had 12 permanent managers during @entity58 's 18 - year reign at @entity7 the 65 - year - old faced his 11th @entity6 manager as his side drew 1 - 1 with @entity13 's men back in september , while he did n't get the chance to take on @entity133 in 2004 as the @entity135 boss resigned after just 13 games in charge			2
@entity58 has come under pressure for a shortage of silverware in recent years but he has ensured local bragging rights have remained with @entity7 fans at the end of each of his seasons in charge			0
@entity6 last finished above the @entity16 way back in 1995 when ending the season in seventh place left them five positions better off than caretaker @entity151 's side			0
@entity152 reversed the trend during the 1995 - 96 campaign , leading the @entity16 to fifth spot and a @entity157 place , before @entity58 took charge in october 1996			0
the former @entity160 boss has helped his side finish above @entity6 for 18 seasons , giving them a 19 - year dominance over their neighbours - an @entity166 record for two clubs in the same division .			0
