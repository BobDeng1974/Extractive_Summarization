dr @entity0 says the 24 - hour surgery is a ' better option ' than running a blocked @entity3 a hospital is set to open the first 24 - hour @entity6 ' surgery in @entity7 in a bid to ease its @entity3 crisis			1
the pioneering service will mean that people who have come to @entity3 in desperation as they are unable to get an appointment with a gp will no longer clog up waiting times for emergency care			1
it has been launched in an attempt to solve the major crisis in emergency care at @entity21 which was so overwhelmed last month that 18 ambulances were seen queuing outside the @entity3 department			1
it is thought the move could be copied by health trusts across the @entity7 to help ease the worst winter @entity3 crisis on record			1
waiting times in @entity3 departments around the @entity7 are at a record high - partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their family doctor			1
doctors say the ‘ groundbreaking ’ plans in @entity21 will involve all 90 gps from across the borough put on a rota to cover shifts at the 24 - hour centre			1
nurses and support workers will also be seconded in to cater for minor injuries and ailments , such as an infected wound , sprains or minor burns			0
patients who turn up at @entity3 will be referred to doctors there on a walk - in basis where they will be given a time slot to avoid long waits			1
organisers say the appointments will be spread throughout the day to avoid the ‘ surges ’ that so often leave emergency staff struggling			0
the surgery aims to transform the fortunes of the hospital ’s emergency department , which has been struggling for several years with the sheer volume of patients turning up at the door			0
last month dr @entity65 , the hospital ’s medical director , said it was ‘ unsustainable ’ for @entity69 services in @entity70 to remain as they are			0
‘ we need to redesign services to help people manage their long term conditions , rather than having them turn up at @entity3 , ’ he added			2
the 24 - hour @entity6 ' surgery was opened after a major crisis in emergency care at @entity21 the hospital was so overwhelmed last month that 18 ambulances were seen queuing outside @entity3 the plans have been unveiled by a newly - formed ‘ federation ’ of @entity6 , and proposes a new @entity82 to be built near the hospital helipad , close to the emergency department entrance			1
dr @entity0 , senior federation member , said : ‘ we have known for a long time that a lot of patients go to @entity3 when they do n’t need to , and this is quite a unique idea to help solve that problem			2
‘ it ’s impossible to get an appointment at many gp surgeries , and we believe that patients then turn up at hospital because of this			0
‘ but with this centre the triage nurse would be able to send patients with more minor problems over to us , which is a far better option than waiting hours and blocking up @entity3			2
’ dr @entity0 said the planned centre could offer 35,000 extra appointments each year , or about 100 per day , and bring an end to the @entity3 crisis			1
the emergency department at the @entity21 is known to be the ‘ busiest in the @entity108 ’ and has repeatedly failed to meet the headline four - hour the situation reached ‘ crisis point ’ over waiting target in recent years			1
@entity113 , 70 , who had to wait hours to be seen in the emergency department , said : ‘ anything they do has to be an improvement			0
‘ it has become diabolical and the number of people seeking treatment at the hospital because they ca n’t get an appointment has exploded			0
’ waiting times in @entity3 departments around the @entity7 are at a record high - partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their family doctor one paramedic said the first weekend of 2015 18 ambulance crews were forced to ‘ queue ’ for around two hours before handing patients over to staff			1
he said : ‘ this will be a massive help because we hope to reduce the number of @entity3 attendances by a big margin			2
it will also link in much better with gp surgeries , because we ’ll have easy access to patient records			0
‘ there are huge delays in the system at the moment , when hospital doctors struggle to find out what medication patients are on , for example , and this puts patients at risk as well			0
‘ this centre will be much quicker , safer and efficient , as well as being much cheaper than seeing everyone in @entity3			2
we think this is a groundbreaking and innovative bid and hopefully we ’ll be successful			2
it ’ll be a huge disappointment if it ’s not			0
’ a formal bid has been submitted to the prime minister ’s £ 100m @entity161 and has the backing of @entity21 , the council and patient groups			1
@entity165 , chairman of the @entity166 for @entity70 , said : ‘ it is absolutely imperative that patients get help when they need it and for many patients , the default seems to be @entity3			2
‘ i am convinced that patients will be seen in a more timely fashion and i am absolutely overjoyed that a not - for - profit organisation is involved in this process			0
i ’m backing them all the way			0
’ @entity177 , chief executive at @entity21 , said there were also plans for on site services such as chemists and therapists to help meet patients ’ needs .			0
