women do not want to ' have it all ' in life , they just want what men have , @entity3 has claimed			1
the high - flying lawyer , married to @entity8 leader @entity7 , insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family			1
mrs @entity3 said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores , with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons			1
@entity3 insisted she does not want to ' have it all ' , but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life mrs @entity3 attended an ' @entity21 in @entity23 ' event at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 as her husband hosted his party conference in @entity28 in a surprise intervention at the @entity8 conference in @entity28 , mrs @entity3 spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
with a successful career in her own right as a lawyer , marriage to the deputy prime minister and three young children , mrs @entity3 , 46 , is often seen as living proof that women are able to ' have it all '			1
but speaking to @entity45 , she made clear that the decision to choose mr @entity7 as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations			1
and she said she had been fortunate to be able ' naturally ' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband			1
@entity54 - born mrs @entity3 was speaking during a visit to a @entity28 college to address female students as part of the @entity60 campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models			1
asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can ' have it all ' , mrs @entity3 told @entity45 : ' i never understand what people mean when they say ' having it all '			2
i personally have never wanted to ' have it all ' as a general aim			2
i just want to have what men have			2
' lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what i want to have			1
' there will be other women who do n't want that			2
it is different for different women and different men			0
' but childcare is an issue , obviously			0
and i think that , as ( @entity100 chief operating officer ) @entity99 said , the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with			1
' mrs @entity3 said she makes sure her husband @entity103 does his share of the household chores , and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons @entity103 and @entity3 visited @entity111 in @entity28 @entity7 has looked to his wife @entity112 to help the @entity8 in the ' fight of our lives ' to stay in power			1
the @entity8 leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in may , but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the @entity124 or @entity125			0
asked if he would rather get into bed with @entity127 or @entity128 in a new power - sharing deal , mr @entity7 joked ' it 's @entity112 every single time ' , as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday			1
she made clear that the deputy prime minister was ready to share housework with her , and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening			1
' there are lots of couples who share more and more ( housework ) , there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children , ' she said			1
' if you look across society and across different countries , certainly in the western world , women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and i certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day 's work at home , and when they get home there is the other half to do			2
' that does n't happen to me			0
it is not an issue for people like you and i who can get help			0
it is an issue for those who ca n't get help , who do n't have the money or circumstances to get help			0
asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high - flying careers with a family life , she said : ' life is all about compromises			1
' there is always a certain equilibrium and in my case , we found it naturally , but i do understand that there are people who plan			0
i 'm just not very good with plans			0
' we tend to share it very naturally			2
we make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage			0
' mrs @entity3 said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life , and felt it was important to give girls the self - confidence to aim high in the world of work			1
' i think we have made a lot of progress , but there is still a little bit more progress to make , ' she said			0
' i think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them			0
' i have n't come across open discrimination against me			0
in terms of a little hidden sexism , i think there are lots of women who do face that			0
' mrs @entity3 yesterday joined her husband on a visit to @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 mrs @entity3 said that when speaking to young women around the @entity232 , ' something i have really noticed that i do n't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self - confidence '			2
she added : ' i wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there , and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects			2
' i do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys			1
' asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls , mrs @entity3 said : ' not necessarily			0
i go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you			0
' if you really want to summarise what i hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain , i hope it is that			0
' unlike her husband , she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday			0
mrs @entity3 chose jeans , shoes from @entity274 and a red printed top from @entity54 brand @entity276 for a visit to a school			0
she later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband 's question - and - answer session .			2
