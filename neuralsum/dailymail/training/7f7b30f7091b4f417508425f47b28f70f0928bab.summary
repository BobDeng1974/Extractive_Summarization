a @entity1 court ruled friday in favor of a @entity4 auction house that plans to sell dozens of @entity6 tribal masks despite pleas from @entity10 ’s @entity9 people , friends to the tribe like actor @entity12 , and even from the @entity14 government			1
after a saga that began around a century ago , these intricate masks — which are fed and nurtured by the @entity9 like the living dead — will be auctioned off to the highest bidder worlds away from where they began their journey in the deserts of @entity10			1
the potentially landmark decision with transatlantic repercussions means the sale can go ahead at @entity26 auction house friday afternoon , giving a rare glimpse of the ornate masks and headdresses to the @entity31 crowd			1
numbering nearly 20,000 , many remaining @entity9 still lead a traditional way of life on three isolated @entity10 mesas and believe the masks carry with them the spirit of divine messenger			1
the auctioneer argued that blocking the sale would have tremendous implications and potentially force @entity4 museums to empty their collections ‘ this decision is very disappointing since the masks will be sold and dispersed , ’ said the tribe 's @entity4 lawyer , @entity57 , outside the courtroom			2
‘ the @entity9 tribe will be extremely saddened by the decision , ’ he said			1
‘ especially since the judgment recognizes that these masks have a sacred value			0
the judge considers that the imminent damage ( to the masks ) is not sufficiently strong			0
’ rare : @entity31 crowds got a rare glimpse of the uniquely @entity14 ' katsinam ' masks april 11 in @entity1 ahead of the court 's decision @entity76 : the antique masks like the ' @entity78 , ' left , and ' @entity79 , ' right , will be auctioned off friday afternoon in @entity1 , worlds away from their @entity10 origins , where the @entity9 say they were stolen in the 1930s and 1940s @entity14 ambassador to @entity4 @entity85 expressed his disappointment over friday ’s ruling after writing a letter to the @entity4 government thursday that urged the sale be suspended due to the ‘ importance of these sacred objects to the @entity9			1
’ the @entity94 ' lawyers have filed a request with the @entity96 , the @entity4 auction market authority , to suspend the sale , he added			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity96 declined immediate comment			0
criminal : actor @entity12 , a ' friend ' to the @entity9 , decried the sale as a ' criminal gesture ' with ' grave moral consequences ' divine : @entity9 say the masks , like the pictured ' @entity106 , ' are imbued with divine spirits and treat them as the ' living dead ' @entity109 , of the @entity111 & @entity112 auction house behind the auction , said he would stop short of any triumphalism over the ruling , ‘ but i 'm happy that @entity4 law was respected			1
’ ‘ i am also very concerned about the @entity94 ' sadness , but you can not break property law , ’ he said			1
‘ these are in ( private ) collections in @entity31 : they are no longer sacred			2
’ @entity109 said the auction house has received ‘ serious threats ’ ahead of the auction			2
indignant : the @entity1 auction house where the masks will be auctioned friday called the masks ' no longer sacred ' worth it ? the striking masks of wood , horsehair , leather , and feathers are expected to fetch upwards of $ 66,000 last week , in an interview with @entity137 , @entity138 was emphatic in his belief that the objects ' meaning had little sway for him or @entity4			1
' @entity4 is a country of rights ! all the mail in the world will not change anything , ' he said			0
' those masks are only sacred when used in a dance			0
they are not sacred afterward			0
' the 70 objects , mainly @entity9 , went on display at @entity155 for the first time as the court battle kicked off thursday			2
unheeded : outcries over the sale of the masks ( pictured are the ' @entity161 , ' left , and ' @entity162 , ' right ) were heard thursday and friday from the @entity14 ambassador to @entity4 , two @entity14 museums , as well as the @entity9 people the masks are undoubtedly striking — surreal faces made from wood , leather , horse hair and feathers — and painted in vivid pigments of red , blue , yellow and orange			2
@entity9 representatives contend the items were stolen at some point , and wanted the auction house to prove otherwise			1
they say the masks have a special status and are more than art , representing their dead ancestors ' spirits			0
disputes over art ownership , demands for restitution , and arguments over whether sacred objects should be sold are nothing new			0
take the continuing row between the @entity191 and @entity192 over the @entity193 , which @entity195 diplomat @entity194 removed from the @entity196 in the 19th century			0
@entity192 wants them back ; but opponents fear that would open the floodgates , forcing @entity202 museums to send home thousands of artifacts			0
sad : @entity9 lawyers said the tribe , numbering around 20,000 , will be ' extremely saddened by the decision '			2

the @entity9 tribe of @entity10 treat such masks as the ' living dead ' and claim the items in @entity1 were stolen nearly 100 years ago
actor @entity12 calls the decision ' a criminal gesture that contains grave moral consequences '
auction house says the objects are ' no longer sacred ' and ' you can not break property law '
