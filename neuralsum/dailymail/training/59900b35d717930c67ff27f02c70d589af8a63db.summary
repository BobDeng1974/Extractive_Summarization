@entity1 rugby league commentator @entity0 has come under fire for mistaking @entity4 - nominated actor @entity3 for @entity5 live on tv			1
@entity0 made the remark while commentating the @entity8 for @entity9 on sunday			2
the camera panned to show actor @entity11 who was watching his team , 2014 @entity13 champions the @entity14 , take on @entity15 's in @entity16 with long - time friend @entity3			1
maybe it was somebody doing an impersonation			0
' the comments drew sharp criticism from viewers , who took to @entity32 to accuse @entity33 of ' casual racism ' and make fun of him for confusing two black actors			0
' ca n't believe @entity0 trotted out the " black guy looks like @entity5 " line			1
i mean , come on , ' @ @entity41			0
' @entity0 utterly embarrassing himself on national tv once again â€¦ claiming his comments were tongue in cheek makes it worse @entity46 , ' @ @entity48 tweeted			0
but @entity0 hit back at his online detractors later in the game			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) was slammed on @entity32 but he hit back at his online detractors , saying : ' pity some people do n't have things better to do on a sunday night ' @entity0 said he ' tongue - in - cheek ' suggested @entity3 looked a little bit like @entity5 ( pictured ) ' off the field we do have of course @entity11 with his @entity60 friends , ' he said			1
' the gentleman there who i tongue - in - cheek suggested looked a little bit like @entity5 but i can tell you it 's the man who played @entity69 in @entity11 's @entity4 - winning movie @entity71			1
' his names ' @entity3 , he 's an actor model from @entity74 , a big pal of @entity11 's , came up here on the helicopter ride with him and apparently social media has lit up with certain comments this evening			1
' pity some people do n't have things better to do on a sunday night but anyway there you are that 's the record cleaned up for you and i hope that you 're enjoying every second of this match here			0
' @entity3 played @entity69 alongside @entity11 in the @entity4 - winning movie @entity71 but @entity32 users continued to slam @entity89 , posting images of other famous black actors and musicians including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
@entity11 decided to ditch the @entity4 in favour of standing side by side with @entity22 to watch their team take on @entity102 in @entity16 for the @entity8			2
the 50 - year - old was all smiles prior to the game , and his spirits lifted even higher when the 2014 @entity13 champions defeated @entity102 39 - 0			0
@entity11 wore his colours proud as he sported a green and red hooded letterman jacket to the game - which he traveled to via helicopter			2
he was seen rubbing shoulders with @entity22 , who was cheering his brothers @entity113 and @entity115 on from the sidelines			0
the actor and director seemed a bit concerned during some moments , but it was n't long before the @entity14 took a dominating lead			0
the @entity14 , of which @entity11 is a co-owner , became the sixth @entity13 winners of the @entity8 , which sees the @entity13 champions take on the @entity126 champions , in the last seven years			2
the @entity128 - @entity127 has been spending most of his time over in @entity130 , where he 's filming 2016 flick @entity132 alongside @entity133			0
