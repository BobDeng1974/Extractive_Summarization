the true scale of tax credit benefits for @entity3 migrants to @entity4 is revealed today – amid warnings that it is turning this country into a ‘ honeypot nation ’			1
figures published last night by the @entity11 think - tank make clear how taxpayers are subsidising low - wage migrant workers			1
a migrant worker with two children earning the minimum wage sees their basic income of less than £ 200 a week propped up with an additional £ 330 in tax credits and other benefits			1
mps @entity21 and @entity23 greet an @entity25 migrant on january 1 , the day temporary restrictions were limited an average worker from @entity27 coming to @entity4 will see their weekly wage go up by nearly half compared to what they would earn at home			1
a worker from @entity34 can double their basic pay and new arrivals from @entity38 will increase their pay by 250 per cent			1
senior @entity41 mp @entity40 said : ‘ we ’ve become a honeypot nation in the @entity3 , which is why we ’ve done well controlling immigration by @entity47 countries , but that has been offset by quite a dramatic increase in immigration from @entity3 countries			0
‘ one of the things that ’s keeping low pay suppressed is the endless supply of cheap labour coming in from the @entity57 , the @entity25 countries , the recent entrants to the @entity3 which has really changed the whole equation			2
‘ and most people come to this country unaccompanied by their families , but they ’re able to claim benefits to support their families back home			0
’ mr @entity40 said migrant numbers were ‘ causing real problems in hospitals , in schools , in provision of public services , shortage of housing ’			0
the @entity11 figures emerged as the row over the government ’s migration target continued			2
it was sparked at the weekend when @entity80 admitted @entity81 was unlikely to meet his pledge to cut net migration – the difference between those arriving and those leaving – to the tens of thousands by may			0
the home secretary said the promise had been ‘ blown off course ’ by a higher - than expected influx from the @entity3			0
senior @entity41 mp @entity40 said : ' we ’ve become a honeypot nation in the @entity3 ' yesterday , a @entity93 spokesman insisted cutting net migration to the tens of thousands remains the prime minister ’s objective – while @entity98 leader @entity97 said the promise was ‘ pretty stupid ’			0
the @entity11 figures show that in @entity27 , the average weekly take - home pay after tax for a single parent with two children is £ 362 ; in @entity34 it is £ 269 and in @entity38 £ 149			1
in @entity4 , a worker on the minimum wage would earn £ 196 , but that is increased by tax credits and other benefits to £ 527			1
it means workers moving to the @entity4 from @entity27 see their earnings go up 45 per cent , from @entity34 by 95 per cent and from @entity38 by a staggering 253 per cent			1
@entity11 said cutting tax credits was necessary to preserve free movement which was beneficial to @entity4 ’s economy			1

@entity3 migrant workers are also potentially entitled to housing benefit			0
overall , @entity4 spends £ 5billion a year on tax credits for migrant workers , with 415,000 foreign nationals benefiting from the perk			1
@entity136 , the @entity34 ambassador to the @entity4 , said refusing @entity34 citizens tax credits when working in @entity4 would be discriminatory under @entity3 law			1
he added : ‘ we pay the same taxes which pay for tax credits doing the same job			2
‘ so imagine you have three people working for the @entity146 – one from @entity27 , one from @entity34 and one from the @entity4 ; they live here , they pay taxes here			2
why should you discriminate against the @entity27 and the @entity34 worker ? ’ mr @entity136 said plans were being drawn up to encourage 2,300 doctors and nurses trained in @entity34 but working in @entity4 to return home			2
‘ of course we want them back , ’ he said			0
