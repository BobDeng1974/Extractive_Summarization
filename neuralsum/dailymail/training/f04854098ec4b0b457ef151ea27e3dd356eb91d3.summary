by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 29 may 2013 for mothers who are desperate to shift the post-natal bulge but simply ca n't bear to spend time apart from their newborn , the answer may be here			0
the world ’s first exercise dvd where mothers can workout while strapped to their baby has been released			1
@entity10 is a special fitness regime which can be safely done with a little one strapped in a harness			1
but she found it difficult to fit exercise around caring for her new - born @entity34 - so came up with a way of working out while carrying her			2
the program is a series of exercises designed to get mothers moving - set alongside cute cartoons and happy tunes which keep bouncing baby happy			1
@entity28 said : ' you see these celebrity mums and it made me think i would have a flat stomach straight after giving birth to @entity34			2
but i soon found out that was n’t the case			0
mum 's the word : the program is a series of exercises designed to get mums moving again and help shift the post-baby weight safety first : @entity10 is a special fitness regime which can be safely done with a little one strapped in a harness famous face : @entity65 ex @entity63 presenter presents the @entity67 workout dvd for mums and their babies bright spark : the video is the brainchild of @entity28 , 39 , who gave birth for the first time a year ago and wanted to get back in shape ' she was three - months - old and i just wanted to get back into shape but my local gym said i could n’t bring her along even sleeping in her pram			1
' it was hard to fit a class in around her schedule and you just do n’t want to be away from them when they are that little , and they do n’t want to leave your side			2
' so i had a search on the internet and there really was n’t much out there except a bit of lifting your baby up and down during yoga , so i came up with @entity10			1
' there are two workouts - the first a 20 - minute session for new mums whose babies are around six - weeks - old			0
fun for all : the dvd does not come with a carrier , but can be done with any conventional type and @entity28 with her daughter @entity34 showcases it it includes gentle exercises designed to stretch out muscles - and there is also a second workout which is more active			1
the dvd - which is fronted by @entity111 presenter @entity65 - does not come with a carrier , but can be done with any conventional type			1
@entity28 added : ' the first one is just to ease mums back in and there are some movements which are good for shoulders which might be a bit hunched from breastfeeding or even bottle feeding			2
' the second one is still fun and easy , but mums might get a bit sweatier			0
it ’s great because instead of having to squeeze in exercise when they are having a nap , you can have them with you and then enjoy a cup of tea or a nap when they drift off			0
brainchild : @entity28 created it because it was hard to fit a class in around her schedule and she did n't want to leave her daughter ' initially i just wanted to do something that both mum and baby could do , but it does have that element of the baby adding extra weight to your exercise			1
' former @entity151 star @entity150 was one of the first mums to try out the dvd before it went on sale last week			0
in just six weeks the svelte mum - of - two said she was able to slip back into her size six clothes			0
@entity150 , 29 , said : ' my baby just giggles away during the dvd			2
i am near enough the size i was before and i was just happy i could get back into my clothes			0
