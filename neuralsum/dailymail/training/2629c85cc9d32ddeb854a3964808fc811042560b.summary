@entity0 has empathised with @entity1 following his announcement to leave @entity3 at the end of the season			1
despite a long list of honours with the @entity9 - including an heroic @entity11 victory against @entity12 in @entity13 in 2005 - @entity1 has his critics for having never lifted a @entity15 trophy with his boyhood club			2
speaking with @entity18 on saturday , former @entity17 midfielder @entity0 revealed his thoughts on the @entity3 captain leaving behind a 17 - year professional career at @entity22 without winning a domestic league title			1
@entity3 captain @entity1 announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season @entity1 kisses the 2005 @entity11 trophy alongside @entity27 but will leave the club ' it 's difficult for me , as a @entity17 fan , to say it 's a pity that @entity1 has never won the league			1
it is easier to say he deserves to have a league winners ' medal , ' @entity0 said			0
the 40 - year - old also aired his views about @entity1 's admirable loyalty to the club hindering his chances of league success			0
' if there was a time to leave @entity3 and join another club , he should have gone to @entity44 when they tried to sign him for the second time after he won the @entity11 in 2005			2
@entity0 said that @entity1 would have gone on to win league titles if he 'd have moved to @entity44 the @entity47 have won the league twice since @entity3 lifted the @entity11 trophy in may 2005 @entity0 lifts the 2013 @entity15 trophy for @entity17 - a feat @entity1 has not accomplished for @entity3 ' it always looked like @entity44 would win the league more than once , ' he added			1
considering @entity44 's two successful campaigns in @entity56 's top flight since that memorable night in @entity13 - in 2005 - 06 and 2009 - 10 - @entity0 was pragmatic in his approach			1
' there are those who say it would have been worth less with @entity44			0
' moving clubs is part of football			0
i was lucky that my club were strong enough that i could fulfil my ambitions there			0
' i wonder if part of his decision to leave @entity3 now was that , compared with last season , the club look much further away from the league title			0

@entity1 announced his decision to leave @entity22 late on *january* 1
@entity0 says that if @entity1 had to leave @entity3 he should have *switched* to @entity44 after the @entity9 ' @entity11 win in 2005
@entity44 have since won domestic league titles in 2005 - 06 and 2009 - 10
midfielder has won nine major honours with the @entity9 but is *missing* a league title
