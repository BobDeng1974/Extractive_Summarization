too few young people in the mix , and healthcare premiums could surge			2
@entity2 announced thursday that about 35 percent of those who signed up for the exchanges are under the age of 35			0

' ' it ’s long past time for @entity57 @entity24 to work with us to remedy the mess they created — and that means repealing this law and replacing it with real reforms that actually lower costs , ' senate minority leader @entity63 , a @entity44 , fired back after @entity2 's speech			1
' the president may want to silence any further debate about @entity11 , but in doing so he betrays a lack of confidence in his own policies and scant regard for those most affected by the law			0
' the president spent nearly as much time during his remarks criticizing @entity44 ' opposition to his signature law as he did touting its success , meanwhile arguing that @entity44 ' time would be better spent passing legislation that would positively affect @entity18 ' lives			1
polling shows the law remains unpopular in much of the country , but @entity24 plan to use the high enrollment figures to argue that by trying to repeal the law , @entity44 are actively working to take health care away from millions of @entity18 who now rely on the exchanges			1

another unknown is how many enrollees sealed the deal by paying their first month 's premium to the insurance companies			0

in a statement sent to reporters after @entity2 's remarks , speaker of the house @entity114 's office once again accused the @entity9 continuing ' to obscure the full impact of @entity11			2
' ' beyond refusing to disclose the number of people who ’ve actually enrolled by paying premiums , the president ignores the havoc that this law has wreaked on private plans that people already had and liked			2
surveys have consistently shown that the overwhelming majority of those who signed up already had insurance , ' @entity114 's press secretary @entity128 said in an email			0
