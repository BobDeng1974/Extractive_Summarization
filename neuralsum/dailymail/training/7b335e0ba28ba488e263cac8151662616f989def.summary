' risking lives ' : @entity1 has been slammed by road safety experts after it admitted dimming its street lights to save money a council has been slammed by mps and furious road safety campaigners - after admitting dimming its street lights to save money			1
cash - strapped @entity1 has cut a number jobs over the last year in a desperate bid to save £ 300m			1
now they have come up with a new covert scheme to save vital funds - by dimming their street lights at night			1
their plan has been criticised by mps and road campaigners the @entity19 - who claim darker streets cause car and pedestrian accidents and leave people ' vulnerable in their own communities '			1
@entity25 , president of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , said : ' new official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked - out town and city roads are not getting better			1
' in fact , on 40mph roads , they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather			0
' this is the type of road where most of the fatalities , for which coroners blamed street - light switch - offs as a contributory factor , happened			1
' @entity41 mp @entity40 blasted the council and suggested it must find efficiency savings in other areas			0
the @entity45 said : ' it 's not just about people feeling vulnerable in their homes , but on the streets of their own communities			1
' surely there is greater risk of robbery and burglary on darker streets			0
' my argument would be that if the council was more efficient then they would n't need to turn lights off or dim them			1
' i agree with the @entity19			0
it 's far more dangerous with the lights off			1
' councillor @entity63 , @entity64 member for @entity65 , said the authority had to strike a ' balancing act '			0
she said : ' there is going to be less light as a consequence but the council has to meet energy targets and this will mean less light pollution			0
' i accept that in the circumstances some people wo n't feel as safe but in the main i think it balances out all those needs			1
' where there are increases of burglaries or accidents that needs to be reviewed			0
' criticism : road safety campaigners claim darker streets cause car and pedestrian accidents and leave people ' vulnerable in their own communities ' @entity1 ( hq above ) admitted some lights are even being switched off completely as part of their controversial plan to save vital funds @entity97 resident @entity96 , 58 , said : ' it is ridiculous to dim the lights to save money as car accidents , or burglaries , end up costing the council money in other areas			1
' @entity105 , 72 , said : ' i do n't feel very safe at the moment in winter walking down the pavement as the new led lights feel dimmer even when they are on full			2
nationally , a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed , compared with 148,000 in may 2010			2
' i would definitely not want to leave my home if they were dimmed further			0
' the council are being a bunch of dimwits and surely this can not be saving them that much money			0
' a county council spokesman admitted lamps were being dimmed from time to time but that it was also carrying out a five - year maintenance cycle as part of a £ 10million investment in led lamps			2
the spokesman admitted some lights are even being switched off completely - but those were only on a short section of the @entity133 between @entity41 and @entity134			2
he said : ' the authority has a programme to install energy saving measures to streetlights which began in 2009 by fitting led lamps to streetlights and fitting controls which allow them to be turned down or ' dimmed '			0
warning : councillor @entity63 , @entity64 member for @entity65 , said the authority must strike a ' balancing act ' between safety and saving money ' @entity1 is responsible for around 148,000 streetlights of which 62,000 are able to be turned			1
' however , neighbouring @entity148 with @entity149 said it was investing £ 9.9million over two years in led lights and had ' no plans ' to dim them			1
coun @entity152 , environment boss at @entity153 , said : ' we are currently undergoing a major refit of our street lights by introducing new energy efficient and long - lasting led lanterns across the borough and they have been installed in many areas already			2
' the new lights are equipped with dimmer switches but we have no plans to do it			2
the lights are different , not dimmer			2
' it is a different kind of light because it is white light			0
it is a better quality light and it works a lot better than yellow light for things like @entity175 as it allows you to see colours			0
' in the future , we will actually save money			0
' by getting on top of the roads and changing the lights , over a 20 - year period , we will save £ 20million which will mean the project will pay for itself as well as give us a big saving			1
' nationally , a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed , compared with 148,000 in may 2010 .			0
