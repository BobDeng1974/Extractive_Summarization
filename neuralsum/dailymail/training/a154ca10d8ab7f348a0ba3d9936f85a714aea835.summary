by @entity0 government officials made an embarrassing blunder by referring to the @entity3 as ' @entity3 ' - the name given to them by the @entity5			1
the @entity6 was pulled into line by the @entity8 after it was caught using the controversial name when sending a purchase order to the islands ' capital @entity13			1
the mistake - which has been made by the government before - meant the address said : ' @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity13 , @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
' @entity6 officials sent a purchase order to the @entity3 , pictured , calling them by their @entity5 name ' @entity3 ' - something which goes against the government 's own policy the use of the term ' @entity3 ' is an embarrassment because it goes against the government 's policy of always calling them the @entity3			1
the use of the @entity31 name is also a snub to islanders - and @entity34 itself - because it could imply that the islands belong to @entity5			1
something which has been in dispute for decades			0
but it is not the first time that @entity15 officials have made the gaffe			2
the islands ' government was forced to complain after it received an order addressed to the ' @entity3 ' in june 2013			1
this week , @entity47 mp @entity46 - who has previously brought up the issue in @entity49 - , tabled a question to foreign secretary @entity51 to ask why the blunder kept happening			0
according to official @entity49 records , mr @entity46 asked whether the secretary of state would ' discuss the correct use of the name @entity3 with the secretary of state for the @entity6 '			1
@entity8 minister @entity58 told mr @entity46 that @entity8 ( @entity8 ) officials had been in contact with the @entity6 to ' remind them of the appropriate terminology for the @entity3 '			2
he said : ' all government departments and agencies should refer to ‘ the @entity3 ’ in all instances			2
foreign secretary @entity51 was asked why the blunders had been made			0
the @entity8 said there was ' no ambiguity ' on what the @entity3 should be called ' there is no evidence that incorrect terminology has been used other than in the isolated cases			0
' mr @entity46 had also asked mr @entity51 in march what discussions he had led ' on the correct use of the name of the @entity3 by @entity15 departments ' , records show			2
mr @entity58 again reported at that time that officials had been ' in contact ' with the offending department to remind them of the appropriate terminology			0
he said : ' no specific cross-governmental guidance has been issued on this matter , but it is clear that all government departments and agencies should use the correct name , which is of course the @entity3			0
' on a previous occasion , he had said : ' there is no ambiguity on this point			0
all @entity94 and agencies should refer to the @entity3 by their correct name , which is the @entity3			0
' the dispute over the islands blew up into a full - scale war after @entity5 invaded the @entity3 on april 2 1982			1

in referendum in march 2013 , which produced a 92 per cent turn out , 1,513 islanders vote to retain their status as @entity34 overseas territory , with just three voting against .			0

@entity6 used the controversial name when sending purchase order
' @entity3 ' goes against @entity15 policy of saying ' @entity3 '
using the @entity31 name could imply disputed islands belong to @entity5
