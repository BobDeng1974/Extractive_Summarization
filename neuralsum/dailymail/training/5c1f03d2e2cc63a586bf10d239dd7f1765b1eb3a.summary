it ’s generally accepted that planets form before moons , gradually collecting their natural satellites over millions or billions of years in cosmic tugs of war			0
but new research could be set to turn the world of planetary science on its head , as scientists have discovered @entity11 may have formed before its parent planet @entity12			2
the incredible theory rules out the possibility that @entity11 formed in the disk of material that surrounded the infant @entity12 - and instead it must have formed elsewhere			1
@entity11 ( pictured ) is the largest moon of @entity12 and , like other natural satellites in the solar system , it was thought to have been born out of a disk of material surrounding its host planet			2
new research , however , suggests its origins may actually pre-date that of @entity12 , challenging our understanding of planetary science the combined @entity29 and @entity30 study was led by @entity31 of @entity32 in @entity33			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity11 resembles a frozen version of @entity37 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity11 is smaller than @entity37 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			2
as on @entity37 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity11 are about seven @entity37 years long			0
@entity11 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity53 , better known on @entity37 as natural gas			1
regular @entity37 - water , @entity57 , would be frozen solid on @entity11 where the surface temperature is @entity59 ( -292 ° f )			1
with @entity11 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity37 's raindrops			1
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
the researchers found firm evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of @entity11 actually originated in conditions pre-dating @entity12			1
in fact , @entity11 ’s nitrogen bears similarities to ancient comets found in the @entity78 cloud - a vast expanse of icy rocks surrounding the solar system			2
the main implication of this new research is that @entity11 's building blocks formed early in the solar system 's history , in the cold disk of gas and dust that formed the sun. this was also the birthplace of many comets , which retain a primitive , or largely unchanged , composition today			1
nitrogen is also the main ingredient in the atmosphere of @entity37 ( it makes up about 78 per cent ) , as well as on @entity11			2
the planet - sized moon of @entity12 is frequently compared to an early version of @entity37 , locked in a deep freeze			1
the research suggests that information about @entity11 's original building blocks is still present in the icy moon 's atmosphere , allowing researchers to test different ideas about how the moon might have formed			1
the formation of our solar system began 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud ( illustration shown )			0
while our sun took shape at its heart , further out in colder regions comets began to form			0
the new research suggests @entity11 , too , formed in these colder regions before @entity12 @entity31 and colleagues demonstrated that a particular chemical hint as to the origin of @entity11 's nitrogen should be essentially the same today as when this moon formed , up to 4.6 billion years ago			1
that hint is the ratio of one isotope ( form ) of nitrogen called nitrogen - 14 to another isotope , nitrogen - 15			0
the small amount of change in this isotope ratio over long time periods makes it possible for researchers to compare @entity11 's original building blocks to other solar system objects in search of connections between them			2
as planetary scientists investigate the mystery of how the solar system formed , isotope ratios are one of the most valuable types of clues they are able to collect			0
in planetary atmospheres and surface materials , the specific amount of one form of an element , like nitrogen , relative to another form of that same element can be a powerful diagnostic tool because it is closely tied to the conditions under which materials form			0
the team found that our solar system is not old enough for this nitrogen isotope ratio to have changed significantly			0
this is contrary to what scientists commonly assumed			0
‘ when we looked closely at how this ratio could evolve with time , we found that it was impossible for it to change significantly , ’ explained @entity31			0
‘ @entity11 's atmosphere contains so much nitrogen that no process can significantly modify this tracer even given more than four billion years of solar system history			1
’ pictured is @entity12 ( background ) and @entity11 ( foreground ) , the latter of which is by far the largest of @entity12 's 62 confirmed moons			0
evidence for @entity11 's formation before @entity12 stems from the ratio of two isotopes of nitrogen in its atmosphere , the ratio of which could not have come about if it formed after @entity12 the study also has implications for @entity37 - it supports the emerging view that ammonia ice from comets is not likely to be the primary source of @entity37 's nitrogen			1
in the past , researchers assumed a connection between comets , @entity11 and @entity37 , and supposed the nitrogen isotope ratio in @entity11 's original atmosphere was the same as that ratio is on @entity37 today			1
measurements of the nitrogen isotope ratio at @entity11 by several instruments of the @entity29 and @entity207 showed that this is not the case - meaning this ratio is different on @entity11 and @entity37 - while measurements of the ratio in comets have borne out their connection to @entity11			1
this means the sources of @entity37 's and @entity11 's nitrogen must have been different			1
other researchers previously have shown that @entity37 's nitrogen isotope ratio likely has not changed significantly since our planet formed			1
' some have suggested that meteorites brought nitrogen to @entity37 , or that nitrogen was captured directly from the disk of gas that formed the @entity228 , ' said @entity31			0
' this is an interesting puzzle for future investigations , ' @entity31 said			0
the ratio of nitrogen suggests @entity11 's origins bear a similarity to comets found in the @entity78 cloud , which is a vast expanse of the icy rocks thought to be surrounding the solar system at a distance of up to a light year ( illustration shown )			1
this would make @entity11 the first moon confirmed to be older than its parent planet @entity31 and colleagues are eager to see whether their findings are supported by data from @entity30 's @entity250 mission , when it studies comet @entity251 beginning later this year			2
if their analysis is correct , the comet should have a lower ratio of two isotopes - in this case of hydrogen in methane ice - than the ratio on @entity11			0
in essence , they believe this chemical ratio on @entity11 is more similar to @entity78 cloud comets than comets born in the @entity266 , which begins near the orbit of @entity268 ( @entity269 is a @entity266 comet )			0
' this exciting result is a key example of @entity274 science informing our knowledge of the history of solar system and how @entity37 formed , ' added @entity279 , @entity274 deputy project scientist at @entity29 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 .			0

@entity33 - led researchers claim @entity11 's origins pre-date those of @entity12
the ratio of nitrogen in the moon 's atmosphere means it must be older
their evidence rules out the previous theory that it formed around @entity12
instead @entity37 - like moon @entity11 may have formed in same region as comets
could also have implications for the origin of nitrogen on our planet
