popular : the playground at the centre of the row , which has had £ 150,000 spent on it by @entity51 , with mr @entity2 's house visible behind the slide ' we do n’t really see how anyone who listened to all the evidence could think that 250 kids screaming not far from your front garden is not likely to be a noise nuisance			1
but that is his decision and we accept it			0
' earlier this month at @entity4 ’ court he said : ‘ the type of noise we have experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with excitement			0
