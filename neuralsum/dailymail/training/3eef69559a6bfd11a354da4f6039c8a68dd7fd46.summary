by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 15 february 2013 firing bullets at targets in a shooting range may not be everyone 's idea of a relaxing holiday			0
but the chance to use pistols , rifles and other kinds of firearms is drawing large numbers of @entity14 tourists to the @entity17 @entity16 island of @entity18 where gun controls are far loser than they are at home			1
at @entity18 's well - equipped shooting ranges , tourists - many of who are women - can use a wide range of weapons from tiny revolvers to @entity28 , @entity29 , semi-automatic pistols and @entity32 military assault rifles			1
taking aim : @entity14 tourist @entity34 , 38 , warms up for a round of shooting at the @entity38 shooting range in @entity39 , @entity18 thrill : two tourists are taught how to fire a rifle by range master @entity43			1
many @entity14 visitors are eager to to shoot a gun at one of @entity18 's ubiquitous ranges restrictions : in @entity14 gun ownership is tightly restricted so large numbers of people head to @entity18 to try their hand with firearms despite a shared sense of shock over the recent rampage by a gunman at @entity17 's @entity58 , the gun tourism business on the @entity17 territory is as brisk as ever			1
' it was such a feeling of power , ' @entity61 , a 30 - year - old @entity14 actor , said after blasting holes in a paper target with a shotgun , a .44 magnum and a @entity69 revolver at @entity18 's @entity38 gun club			1
' but , ' he said , ' i still do n't think anyone should be allowed to have one of their own			0
' many @entity14 see @entity17 's gun culture as both frightening and fascinating because the only people with handguns in their society are in the military , the police or criminals			1
experience : mr @entity43 prepares shooting certificates for @entity14 tourists following a session at the gun club thrill : @entity61 , ( right ) a 30 - year - old @entity14 actor , practices shooting a rifle at the @entity38 range in @entity39 , @entity18 because firearms are so hard to find in @entity14 , gun - related crime is extremely rare			1
they were used in only seven murders in the country - a nation of about 130 million people - in 2011			0
in the @entity17 , by contrast , with 315 million people , there are more than 11,000 gun - related killings annually			2
the @entity14 are proud of their low crime rate and generally support tough gun - control policies			2
but for many - a trip to @entity18 's ubiquitous shooting ranges is just too tempting			2
advertising : tourists walk under a banner in @entity14 advertising a gun club in @entity18 ' i think it 's human nature to be curious about something that is forbidden , ' said @entity116 , a @entity14 native who emigrated to the @entity17 30 years ago and runs the @entity38 range			1
' most of our customers are from @entity14 and have never had the opportunity to shoot a gun			2
it 's very exotic for them , and it 's very exhilarating			0
' so exhilarating that he sometimes asks his guests to stay around for a while to calm down after they have finished shooting			0
many other tourists - from @entity129 , @entity130 and increasingly @entity131 - are less impressed by the chance to shoot guns			2
all @entity129 men , for example , learn how to shoot during mandatory military service			0
' to them , learning how to use a gun was a chore , ' said @entity140 , general - manager of the @entity142 indoor shooting range			0
' it brings back bad memories			0
they hardly ever come here			0
' visitors to his range are greeted by movie posters for ' @entity150 ' and ' @entity152 ' films , with their iconic , gun - toting action heroes			0
' when most @entity14 people think of @entity17 culture , one of the first things they think of is guns , ' said @entity34 , a 38 - year - old @entity159 woman who said she enjoyed shooting so much she was back at a range for the second time in three days			1
' @entity17 movies and video games are full of guns and that 's appealing , in a frightening sort of way , ' she said , ' but i think @entity14 has it right			1
' if you do n't have a gun , you ca n't kill someone with it			0

tight restrictions at home mean @entity14 have little *access* to guns
many visit the @entity17 @entity16 island of @entity18 where controls are looser
@entity184 's gun clubs offer chance to fire anything from pistols to assault rifles
