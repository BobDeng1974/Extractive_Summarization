by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 1 december 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 1 december 2013 @entity3 's rise to world dominance is one of the ‘ defining facts ’ of our age and we must ‘ like it or lump it ’ , @entity1 says today			1
in an article that risks angering other @entity12 leaders , he will offer to be @entity14 ’s strongest advocate in the @entity15 - saying no country is ‘ more ready ’ than @entity17 to welcome @entity3 to the ‘ top table of global affairs ’			1
the prime minister , who is leading @entity17 ’s largest ever trade delegation to @entity3 , suggests the country is on the brink of becoming the leading global economic superpower and it is pointless to see it as a ‘ threat ’			1
instead he says @entity17 wants to ‘ forge a dialogue of mutual respect and understanding ’ and calls on other countries to do the same			2
supporter : prime minister @entity1 , pictured centre with the @entity17 trade delegation visiting @entity3 , says trade with @entity3 is an opportunity and not a threat starting a three - day visit to @entity3 , the prime minister will propose a free trade deal between the @entity41 and @entity3 - a suggestion which will infuriate many other @entity12 leaders			1
while all are keen to boost trade with @entity14 , there are fears that a full - scale free trade arrangement would lead to @entity3 flooding the @entity15 with cheap goods , often ripped off from @entity51 manufacturers			1
writing in a @entity3 magazine , mr @entity1 insists the country ’s unstoppable transformation ‘ is one of the defining facts of our lifetime ’			1
he writes : ‘ last year @entity3 became the world ’s largest trading nation			0
‘ next year @entity3 is set to become the world ’s largest importer of goods and later this century it will become the world ’s biggest economy			2
’ ‘ we should be clear that there is a genuine choice for every country over how to respond to this growing openness and success			0
‘ they can choose to see @entity3 ’s rise as a threat or an opportunity			0
they can protect their markets from @entity3 or open their markets to @entity3			0
they can try and shut @entity3 out – or welcome @entity3 as a partner at the top table of global affairs			0
‘ @entity17 ’s answer is clear			0
we want to see @entity3 succeed			0
whether it is welcoming @entity3 ’s investment in our nuclear energy sector , or creating a western hub for the renminbi in the @entity87 , we believe that the right way forward is openness , dialogue , trade and investment ; working together for mutual benefit not against each other in a zero - sum game			0
’ new trade : the prime minister , pictured with the largest @entity17 trade delegation to ever visit the country , will pledge his support to opening up trade between @entity3 and the @entity41 @entity3 ’s rise is happening at ‘ 100 times the scale and ten times the speed of @entity17 ’s own urbanisation two centuries ago ’ , he adds			1
mr @entity1 will offer the @entity3 a ‘ lasting friendship that can become a blueprint for future co-operation between our countries : a partnership for growth and reform that can help to deliver the @entity3 dream – and long - term prosperity for @entity17 too ’			1
the prime minister last visited @entity3 in november 2010 , but relations were plunged into the deep freeze when he met the @entity121 , the exiled spiritual leader of @entity122 , in 2012			1
he has apparently since been forgiven by @entity14 after making clear @entity17 does not support @entity124 independence , coupled with indications from @entity126 that he has no plans for a further meeting			2
his gushing magazine article goes on to welcome @entity3 reforms to ‘ free its markets and open them up to foreign participation ’			0
he writes : ‘ there is no greater advocate of that economic openness than @entity17 and no better partner for @entity3 as it opens to the world			1
‘ put simply , there is no country in the western world more open to @entity3 investment , more able to meet the demands of @entity3 consumers , or more willing to make the case for economic openness in the @entity148 , the @entity149 and the @entity41			2
and there is no country more ready to forge a dialogue of mutual respect and understanding			0
’ meeting : @entity1 will meet with @entity3 's premier @entity155 to discuss a trade agreement between the @entity41 and @entity3 the prime minister - who is scheduled to visit @entity14 , @entity158 and @entity159 during his trip - will suggest that a free trade deal between the @entity41 and @entity3 would unleash tens of billions to the @entity12 and @entity3 economies			1
today , at a meeting with @entity3 premier @entity155 in @entity14 , the prime minister will make clear he is ready to throw his political weight behind an agreement to liberalise trade between @entity3 and the @entity41 - the world ’s largest trading bloc and @entity3 ’s biggest trading partner			1
such a deal would deliver a sizeable economic prize with initial economic analysis suggesting it could be worth up to £ 1.8bn every year to the @entity17 economy alone , he says			0
his focus on the deal also underlines his determination to keep @entity17 inside a reformed @entity41 - a position which risks angering some hardline @entity180			1
‘ @entity17 is uniquely placed to make the case for deepening the @entity41 ’s trade and investment relationship with @entity3			1
‘ building on the recent launch of @entity41 - @entity3 negotiations on investment , and on @entity3 ’s continued commitment to economic reform , i now want to set a new long - term goal of an ambitious and comprehensive @entity190			2
and as i have on the @entity41 - @entity192 deal , so i will put my full political weight behind such a deal which could be worth tens of billions of dollars every year , ’ he adds			0
the government has already started making the case for the deal , raising it with @entity12 partners , including at a summit in @entity202 last week , officials say			0
the government believes that a free trade deal would eliminate tariffs in 20 key sectors and would save @entity17 exporters approx $ 1bn a year			1
the @entity17 has significant strengths in these high tariff areas , which include vehicles , pharmaceutical , mechanical and electrical goods , and which together account for 36 per cent of @entity17 exports to @entity3			2
inward investment into @entity17 from @entity3 will get a further boost on the trip when the @entity216 responsible for authorising all major overseas investments signs a landmark deal backing @entity3 companies to invest in the @entity17 , as well as supporting more investment from @entity17 companies into @entity3			2
this will be the first deal of its kind between @entity3 and a @entity12 partner			0
mr @entity1 is also promising to speed up the process for patents so that businesses concerned about the economic impact of intellectual property infringement in @entity3 , estimated to cost from tens of millions to several billion pounds			1
in 2012 , 1 in 4 @entity17 businesses were put off doing business overseas due to concerns around intellectual property theft			0
the prime minister will today visit @entity237 ’s training academy in @entity14 to mark its official opening as the firm sign sa new agreement to provide 100,000 cars to the @entity242 in @entity3 over the next year , demonstrating the value of the @entity17 market to @entity17 companies			1
among more than 100 business figures accompanying the pm are executives from @entity237 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 and the football @entity250 , as well as many smaller companies and half a dozen government ministers			0
culture secretary @entity254 will push @entity17 media and cultural exports , while environment secretary @entity257 will seek to do a series of deals in food and agriculture			0
@entity262 will hold talks on marketing health services to @entity3 ’s government			0
although @entity17 is still well behind some other @entity12 nations in terms of trade with @entity3 , in the first six months of the year exports jumped 20 per cent , while inward investment has climbed to a 30 - year high over the last 18 months .			2

prime minister is leading @entity17 's largest ever trade delegation to @entity3
mr @entity1 will propose a free trade deal between the @entity41 and @entity3
he intends to offer to be @entity14 's strongest advocate in the @entity15
but leaders of other @entity41 countries fear this could lead to @entity3 flooding the @entity15 with cheap , fake goods
