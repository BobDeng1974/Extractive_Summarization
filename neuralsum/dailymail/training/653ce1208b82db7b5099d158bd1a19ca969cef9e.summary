by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 saturday is a big day for the @entity2 , and not just for @entity4 defender per			1
his brother @entity5 will also wake up in huge anticipation today			2
‘ my brother goes on the @entity4 away trips , just to improve his @entity11 and get on with away fans , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ he loves it and , when he has time , he comes over for away games			1
he is with a group from @entity17 , everyone is really excited			0
they also came for the semi-final			0
brothers in arms : @entity5 ( top ) follows his brother @entity8 around the world watching him play the smaller @entity25 : @entity5 ( second from left ) will be travelling to @entity27 with a group of @entity25 fans ‘ i said “ if you want to come to the final you have to come to the semi first ”			1
’ this @entity27 clash will be particularly poignant for the @entity35 brothers given @entity8 is yet to play in a final of a club competition after an ankle injury robbed him of a place in the @entity41 team for the 2009 @entity43 and @entity44 showpieces			1
‘ at that time we played @entity46 in the semi-final of the @entity43 and @entity44 , ’ said the 29 - year - old			0
‘ we beat them in the @entity43 and i scored against them			0
we went to @entity46 again in the @entity44 second leg and i got injured so i missed two finals			0
that was not a nice feeling			0
’ @entity5 should n’t be alarmed or insulted should the @entity55 ’ faithful break into a rendition of their now infamous song about his brother			2
‘ big f * * * * * * @entity25 , he ’s just a big f * * * * * * @entity25 , ’ is likely to echo at @entity27 today if mertesacker scores as he did in the semi-final against @entity61			1
@entity64 : the big @entity25 defender celebrates scoring the equaliser against @entity61 at @entity27 despair : during his time at @entity70 missed out on two cup finals fan favourite : @entity73 has become popular with the @entity4 faithful thanks to his calm displays after a slow start to his career in north @entity79 , the giant defender has established himself as one of @entity82 ’s main men and a firm crowd favourite			1
but he admits his cult status — and that chant — has taken him by surprise			2
‘ i was frightened when i first heard the chant because of the ‘ f ’ word , ’ said the @entity17 international			2
‘ you ca n’t say that on tv			0
it was always a bit weird but a @entity25 journalist told me they quite like you			2
my first impression on that was not good but finally i got it			0
so it looks like we like each other			0
’ they ’ll like him even more tonight if @entity35 can help @entity4 end their nine - year trophy drought .			1

@entity35 goes to all @entity4 *'s* away games
big brother @entity8 has become a *mainstay* of the @entity4 defence
big @entity25 admits at first he did *n't* like the fans ' chant about him , but now he loves them
