by @entity0 it 's here , but with some niggles : a small number of early @entity5 5 buyers have reported problems with their handsets the @entity5 launch has been one of the biggest and most successful in history			2
but that does n't mean it has been without problems , with users who got their hands on early models reporting a wealth of problems			2
the catalogue of complaints include faulty wi - fi connections and scratching on the aluminum casing , as well as confused weather reports from the voice - activated @entity25 assistant and reports of light ' bleeding ' out from the side of the phone			1
more disturbing seems to be the small number of handsets which ' rattle ' when shaken - attributed to to a loose battery within the device , while other users are finding that their batteries drain within hours			2
users are also warned that the @entity38 storage service run by @entity39 will be reduced from @entity40 of storage space to @entity42 at the end of the month - potentially placing back - ups at risk			0
alongside complaints about the patchy quality of @entity39 's new @entity50 app , the website @entity46 collated a variety of bugs from @entity39 users , largely sourced from @entity39 's support forums			0
it is not unexpected for some new devices to have manufacturing errors - particularly when five million products have been shipped within the opening weekend			1
even if just one per cent of the first batch of phones has an error , that is still 50,000 defective handsets in the market			2
some users are reporting problems with connecting to secured @entity68 networks - with connections either being blocked or running slowly			0
users on the @entity39 forums suggest this is a software issue which will be resolved with new firmware updates			0
while the phone appears to be fairly resistant to scratching , there are also reports that the aluminium casing on the @entity5 can wear off around the screen			1
the led backlight also reportedly ' bleeds out ' from the screen , appearing as a thin white light around the edges of the screen			1
stocked up : an @entity39 employee racks up hundreds of iphone 5s in @entity85 for those who use @entity25 for their weather updates , many users are finding that the voice - activated personal assistant is mixing up its cities			1
if you ask for the weather in @entity94 , @entity25 reports the weather for @entity94 , @entity96 - yet on - screen it still says it is reporting on the city			1
it is also confusing @entity100 , @entity101 with @entity100 , @entity102 , alongside other place - names which appear more than once on a map			0
@entity46 finally warned that users will no longer be offered @entity106 of free space when they sign up to @entity38 - instead the space is plummeting to just five gigabytes			0
this may not be enough to contain all your cloud back - ups - particularly if you own more than one @entity39 device - so users are warned they should consider paying @entity39 $ 40 a year , or risk losing their data .			0

problems include phones that ' rattle ' and light ' bleeding ' out of the screen
@entity25 ' issuing wrong weather reports ' when *choosing* between two cities of the same name
