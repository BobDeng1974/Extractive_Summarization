on parade : @entity1 , resplendent in his marching guardsman tank top , strikes a relaxed pose his father says he is ‘ a little bit of a rascal ’ — and these adorable new portraits of @entity1 , now 17 months old , show plenty of mischief in his huge brown eyes			1
here , @entity13 reveals what the photos tell us about his development			1
the @entity18 when the first informal picture of @entity21 was taken by @entity23 ’s father , @entity22 , it was clear the @entity24 would not soon be sitting through any formal photoshoots with strange ( if highly skilled ) photographers			1
this time the pictures were taken by a member of the couple ’s staff , rather than an outside professional , reflecting the deep trust the couple have for their inner circle of advisers			1
the chosen cameraman was @entity38 , prince @entity39 ’s private secretary , who has previously worked as a freelance photographer			1
he joined the household office of the @entity42 and @entity23 and prince @entity39 at @entity43 in 2013			2
he previously served in @entity44 and @entity45 in the @entity46 , with the @entity47 , and was a captain			2
after leaving the military , he took a masters degree at the @entity51 in @entity52 and @entity53			2
he joined the @entity43 after getting to know @entity39 through a mutual involvement in the @entity56 charity			2
the choice of photographer appears to have paid off — the photos are relaxed and full of character , reflecting the fact they were taken by someone @entity21 already knows			2
braving the cold the pictures were taken in a courtyard at @entity43 , which is the @entity68 base of the @entity42 and @entity23 , where they live in the apartments previously used by @entity71			2
that this location was chosen reflects the way in which @entity23 and @entity74 cherish their home life , and the great fun and freedom @entity1 is afforded in the private grounds			1
though the pictures were taken at the end of november , @entity21 is in shorts with bare legs — indicating not just the unseasonal warm temperatures this year but his love of the outdoors			2
he might be a prince , but he is hardy , too			2
@entity86 breaks with tradition not only are his lovely golden locks catching attention here — so , too , is the strong comb - over , and its distinct direction			1
for while @entity21 ’s hair is parted on the right , traditionally men part theirs on the left and women on the right			1
although the distinction is now largely considered outmoded , there is a body of thought that holds that right - hand partings on men do not look good — particularly on would - be leaders			1
the chosen cameraman was @entity38 , prince @entity39 ’s private secretary , who has previously worked as a freelance photographer ( left ) and @entity21 breaks tradition with the direction of his parting ( right ) some believe this was even a factor in the @entity116 presidential election in 2000 — @entity117 parted his hair on the left , making him appear stronger and more suited to be president than his opponent @entity121 , who parted his hair on the right			1
the change is perhaps most obvious in the original @entity126 films , where @entity127 parted his hair on the right when he was @entity129 and on the left when he was @entity126			1
and the left - sided parting certainly seems to have worked out for two other advocates — prince @entity74 and @entity39 , when they were children			1
some have suspected the influence here of @entity21 ’s @entity137 nanny @entity136 , hired earlier this year			0
in fact , the parting decision is due to @entity21 ’s natural hair pattern , says leading hairdresser @entity141			0
‘ this is an adorable haircut and complements his look , which is very retro , forties and a bit @entity146			1
it is also very on trend with the sweep over , ’ says @entity141			0
@entity21 is cuddled by his mother , the @entity23 ( left ) and his father @entity74 , right ‘ i can see a little cowlick — a swirling section at odds with the rest of the hair — and that is dictating where the hair is parted			1
‘ any good hairdresser goes by looking at your crown and any cowlicks to see where you hair parts naturally			0
’ but his current style and colour is not an indicator of what it will be in adulthood , says hairdresser @entity171 — in fact , he may end up dark like his mother			0
‘ you can expect his hair to change completely in colour and texture between the ages of five and seven , and then again in his teens , ’ she says			0
‘ we all wonder whether there will be baldness , as there is plenty on the @entity187 side , but trichologists advise looking at the mother ’s father to see what will happen , and @entity22 has a full head of hair			0
’ @entity195 ’s @entity194 cheeks as pink as a blushing milkmaid and even a visibly swollen cheek on one side — it certainly looks as if poor @entity1 is teething at the moment			1
we have already seen his front teeth make an appearance , and now it looks as if his molars are coming through , too , hence the swelling			0
he is entirely on schedule here — experts say the first teeth appear around the six - month mark with a full set of milk teeth in place after about two years			1
the pro ’s verdict ‘ this is a successful set of pictures which are technically accomplished , ’ says professional photographer @entity220			0
‘ the lighting is flat , the background is neutral , the exposure is correct			0
you can tell they have been done by someone with professional experience but what is nice is that you can also see they have been taken by someone the boy is comfortable with			0
there is a naturalness about them			0
’ for while @entity21 might appear naturally photogenic , it is a huge challenge to take good , candid portraits of children			1
‘ they have a short attention span and it shows if they are not happy , ’ says @entity240 , co-founder of the @entity242 picture agency , which photographed @entity21 on the @entity244 tour			0
‘ it can be very hard to get children to smile , and some hate having their pictures taken so cry			0
’ @entity21 ’s happy demeanour suggests his parents or nanny were present , says @entity240			0
‘ he is probably looking at them , ’ he says			0
‘ but it would be nice if he was looking at the camera in more than just the one shot			0
‘ yet the fact his parents have chosen this set of pictures , with quirky images , says a lot about them and their love of his character			0
