by @entity0 for @entity1 for animal lovers , the chance to see majestic creatures such as whales in their natural habitat is often the high point of a holiday			0
but conservationists have warned that boat trips to watch whales and dolphins might be stressing them out and putting their survival in jeopardy			1
minke whales off the coast of @entity17 have been observed breathing heavily and speeding away from tourist boats , while populations of bottlenose dolphins in @entity21 on popular boat routes have plummeted			1
some experts think is because they are being driven from their preferred feeding grounds by well - meaning tourists eager to see their favourite animal			2
scientists are most concerned about disruption causing marine animals to expend extra energy or failing to eat in their preferred areas , @entity43 reported			0
@entity49 of the @entity50 showed that minke whales swimming in @entity52 in @entity17 sped away from whale - watching boats			1
earlier this year he also reported that the whales breathed more heavily in the presence of a boat trip – just like they do when they are stressed and encounter a predator			0
@entity49 of the @entity50 showed that minke whales swimming in @entity52 in @entity17 sped away from whale - watching boats minke whales off the coast of @entity17 have been observed upping their speed and breathing heavily when boats came near - indicating stress			1
a stock image of the whales in @entity65 is pictured many people may think – why not stop eco-tourism boat trips all together ? but they offer jobs to locals who may traditionally have hunted the animals			1
such trips also spread an important message of conservation			0
by attracting tourists , they also become a valuable commodity to be kept safe			0
the number of people taking eco-tourism boat trips is thought to be around 13 million across 119 countries			2
the 2008 figure shows a massive rise in popularity compared with 1991 , when four million people in 31 countries took the trips			0
in 2008 , the @entity87 , estimated the eco-tourism industry was worth a staggering $ 2.1 billion ( £ 1.3bn )			0
while a new study will note that numbers of whales have not been affected by boat trips in the area , dr @entity49 has shown that similar trips have led to depleted bottlenose dolphin populations in @entity96 , @entity21			1
he fears the animals could become extinct in a matter of decades , as they appear to be driven away from feeding grounds by the tourist boats			0
in order to tackle the problem , dr @entity49 thinks scientists must work out which populations are most at risk , by looking at the short - term effects of eco-tourism and modelling them over long periods			1
this way , they could separate adaptations from long - term threats			1
he thinks that measures such as minimum distances between animals and boats could help , if they are standardised and enforced			0
some scientists are concerned that eco-tourism trips are killing animals one at a time and say that boat trips could prove to be the nail in the coffin for struggling species that have previously been threatened by hunting			2
bottlenose dolphins could become extinct in a matter of decades in @entity96 , @entity21 ( mapped ) as they appear to be driven away from feeding grounds by the tourist boats , experts said dr @entity49 has shown that eco-tourism boat trips have led to depleted bottlenose dolphin populations in @entity96 , @entity21			1
a stock image of bottlenose dolphins is pictured a sound that has baffled scientists since the 1960s - a strange , rhythmic noise heard underwater and similar to a slightly robotic duck quack - was recently revealed to be that of a minke whale.the bio-duck sound had been recorded at various locations in the @entity143 , but its source remained a mystery until april			1
the mysterious sounds were thought to be made by submarines , by some oceanographic phenomenon , or even by fish			0
in february 2013 , an international team of researchers deployed acoustic tags on two @entity65 minke whales in @entity154 off the western @entity155			2
these tags were the first acoustic tags successfully deployed on this species and the acoustic data they provided was analysed by scientists at @entity163 's @entity162 ( @entity164 )			0
the identification of the @entity65 minke whale as the source of the sound now indicates that some minke whales stay in ice - covered @entity65 waters year - round , while others undertake seasonal migrations to lower latitudes .			2

boat trips have been found to stress minke whales and bottlenose dolphins
whales off the coast of @entity17 have been observed upping their speed and breathing heavily when boats came near , signifying their *distress*
populations of bottlenose dolphins have *plunged* off the coast of @entity21 because they are bring pushed out of feeding areas , experts claim
rules about how close boasts should get to animals and *knowledge* of long - term population trends could help solve the problem
