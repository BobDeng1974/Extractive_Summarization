by @entity1 reporter published : 10:14 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 7 august 2013 in 1981 @entity2 was a happy - go - lucky 21 - year - old man who had everything to live for			1
a supremely talented high school baseball player , he had just been selected for a final trial with the @entity6 who appeared desperate to have him sign a contract			1
and @entity2 , known to his friends as @entity11 , could well have become as star - a powerful 6ft 4ins , he could throw 90mph with ease			1
@entity15 , sliders even the new and tricky split - finger fastball , he could do it all			0
free : @entity2 who served 27 years in prison after being framed for the gruesome murder of man in 1981 but in a shocking miscarriage of justice , the only ball @entity2 would get to play for the next 27 years would be behind prison walls , as detailed in an sbnation.com feature			1
on december 4 , 1981 , a jury found @entity2 guilty of the murder of 40 - year - old @entity27 , an openly gay construction supervisor , who was found beaten to death in @entity29 , @entity30			1
@entity27 was found at a place known locally as ' @entity32 ' , a popular pick - up spot for gay men			2
his face had been smashed in and his lips ripped off			0
to the jury who sent him down , the evidence against @entity2 would have been more than compelling			1
there was the testimony of a 56 - year - old gay man called @entity43 who claimed to have been in the @entity29 car lot when a blood - splattered @entity2 emerged from the woods			1
@entity43 said he had paid @entity2 $ 20 for oral sex and that the next day he had found @entity48 's bloody t - shirt in the back of his pick - up truck with the words ' surf - it ' on the front			1
@entity2 's then girlfriend @entity54 testified she had found @entity2 on the night of the murder standing next to the dead body , bloody and shirtless			1
and then there was dog - handler @entity58 , whose amazing sniffer dog had managed to trace @entity2 's scent all the way from the courthouse to the scene of the crime			1
in addition , a man who @entity2 had shared a cell with while awaiting trial in jail claimed @entity2 had confessed to the murder and had even demonstrated how he had killed @entity27			1
for the young @entity2 sitting in the dock it must have been a living nightmare			1
if truth be told he was no angel			0
he was known to be openly homophobic , although in 1981 as a young straight man it would be more unusual if he was n't			2
@entity2 , performed an emotional rendition of the @entity79 before a match at the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity30 last year he liked a drink and smoked marijuana , and by some accounts used to crash parties to steal booze and drugs			1
as he heard the evidence against him he mouthed off in court on more than one occasion and had to be repeatedly told to quieten down by the judge			0
knowing he was innocent , @entity2 had never arranged for a lawyer to be present at the initial interviews and right up until the last moment he felt sure justice would prevail			2
in fact all the evidence against him was a sham			0
just 12 days after the trial , the girlfriend @entity100 retracted her entire story and admitted she had been having sex with a police sergeant investigating the case			0
she said a member of the @entity107 had told her she would ' rot in jail ' if she did n't testify against @entity2			2
despite this the judge refused to hold a retrial saying there was still enough evidence to convict @entity2 without her testimony			2
but @entity58 , whose amazing sniffer dog had seemingly manged to track @entity2 's scent so spectacularly was later exposed as a conman			2
when his dogs were subjected to independent tests they failed and his tracking dog trainer 's certificate was found to be a forgery			2
he had apparently been fed information by the @entity126 so he could repeatedly pick out @entity127 as the offender			0
and @entity43 - who had identified @entity2 as the man he had given a lift to after emerging blood - splattered from the woods - had originally given a description that bore no resemblance at all to @entity2			1
while @entity43 told police the man had a short curly hair and a thin mustache , @entity2 was clean shaven with long shaggy hair			1
@entity140 , the man who claimed @entity2 had confessed to him while awaiting trial , later admitted he 'd lied to avoid charges being brought against him and that a sheriff 's agent had told him exactly what to say			1
but in december 1981 @entity2 was sent to @entity146 , home to some of the country 's most violent offenders			1
on his first night he was attacked by five men who took turns in raping him			0
after that he was raped on a regular basis			0
governor @entity155 signs a bill for @entity2 's wrongful conviction as the 52 - year - old , left , looks on he was put on laundry duty with @entity160 , the serial rapist and murderer			2
it would have been a terrible experience for any man , but for someone who knew he was innocent , it must have been unbearable			2
his only release was learning the guitar and playing prison softball , at which he excelled			0
as the years passed he continued to play , even after his knees gave way and he had to drag himself from base to base			0
in many @entity177 prisons , if you do n't play softball , chances you bet on it and as @entity2 gained a reputation for fielding winning teams it meant he earned protection from the prison 's big men			2
in 1996 @entity184 , a man who had been convicted of raping a woman at knifepoint applied for evidence in his case to undergo the then brand new dna testing			2
in 2001 the tests proved he had not committed the crime and in 2004 he was finally released			1
the following year @entity2 , who had by then spent 24 years behind bars , applied for dna testing in his own trial			1
the incriminating yellow t - shirt discovered in the back of @entity43 's pick - up truck was found to have none of @entity2 's dna on it			1
the traces of blood were from the victim @entity27 and another man			0
@entity205 spent 27 years behind bars until dna evidence proved his innocence despite this the state still rejected calls for a new trial based on dna evidence and instead scheduled a evidentiary hearing for 2009			1
but @entity2 was released , albeit on a $ 100,000 bond , and on november 18 2008 he took his first steps of freedom in well over a quarter of a century			1
in a detailed and fascinating interview with writer @entity219 , @entity2 recalled : ' the feeling is something you only reach a few times in your life			2
' it 's a man in the desert who finally finds water			0
' just a few weeks after the evidentiary hearing the state filed a nole prosequi meaning they had decided to dismiss all charges			0
a few years later in 2012 @entity2 was granted a full pardon by @entity30 governor @entity155			1
after he was cleared the @entity107 reopened the @entity27 case			0
eventually a man named @entity238 , who was 17 at the time came forward			0
he said that for years he had been desperate to confess and that on the night of @entity27 's death he had been hanging out on the beach , drinking and smoking marijuana with three other men @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			0
according to @entity248 , @entity27 had approached the group and they had started chatting			0
he had a beer and a few drags on one of the joints being passed around			0
@entity27 and @entity247 then wandered off			0
after a while the other members of the group went looking for them			0
when they were discovered the couple having sex in the woods , @entity247 pretended he was being attacked and started punching @entity27			0
the @entity246 brothers joined in the attack			0
at one point @entity27 managed to get up and run away but the according to @entity248 , the @entity263 chased him down the beach and continued the beating until @entity27 was still			0
when fresh dna tests were carried out on the shirt , the @entity247 was found to match .			1

@entity2 ' @entity269 looked set to be signed by the @entity6 in 1981
but he was framed for the gruesome murder of a gay man on a @entity30 beach
it was not until 2008 that he was freed after dna tests proved his innocence
