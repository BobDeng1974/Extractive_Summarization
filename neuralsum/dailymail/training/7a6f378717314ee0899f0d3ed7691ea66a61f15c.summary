more than half of @entity2 pilots have fallen asleep in the cockpit of a passenger plane			1
and alarming research has revealed that one in six commercial pilots has woken up at the controls - only to see that their co-pilot is dozing too			1
the findings were revealed yesterday , following reports that two pilots fell asleep on a @entity2 passenger plane last month			1
in the air : the captain and co-pilot of the @entity18 @entity17 blamed their long shifts for falling asleep but the @entity20 accepts the pair were not asleep at the same time the captain and co-pilot of the @entity18 @entity17 blamed their long shifts			1
sir @entity23 ’s @entity18 admitted its plane was involved , but denied reports that both pilots were asleep at the same time			1
a spokesman said the captain and co-pilot were sleeping in alternate 20 - minute intervals – an approved practice known as ‘ in - flight napping ’			1
a @entity20 report stated ‘ pilots asleep ’ but the company says the issue was about fatigue			1
the incident was logged after one of the pilots reported it			0
however today the @entity20 said in a statement : ' following clarification from the airline concerned , the @entity20 is satisfied that while this was a reportable event , and both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately , they did not fall asleep at the same time			1
' it was right that the airline reported this to us after one of the pilots raised their concerns			0
the airline is now taking steps to adjust its rostering arrangements for flight crew			0
' the @entity20 described it as an isolated incident , and experts said passengers ’ lives were not at risk because the plane would have been on auto - pilot			1
airlines involved in safety alerts are not normally identified – so as not to discourage them from reporting future incidents and risking negative publicity			0
the @entity20 does not name the airlines involved in its @entity73 ( @entity72 ) scheme as it relies on the honesty of firms and their crews to highlight concerns			1
airlines are legally obliged to report any potential safety breaches to the @entity20 while individual crew members can also report incidents			2
but critics argue that passengers have the right to know which airlines are involved as it could influence their decisions about booking flights			0
a @entity20 spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t identify airlines because that would potentially impact on future reporting			2
‘ we have @entity72 so that people can feel comfortable reporting concerns , and so any risks can be mitigated			0
the idea is that the industry can learn from these reports , not so that someone can apportion blame			0
’ a @entity20 report said the crew were ‘ suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue ’			2
it added : ‘ both members of flight crew had only five hours sleep in two nights due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep			0
both crew rested for 20 - minute rotations and fell asleep			0
’ the @entity20 has recorded two previous incidents of pilots falling asleep in the cockpit			1
however , the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) said the industry regulator only recorded episodes that were reported – and warned that pilots fell asleep with alarming regularity			2
the union , which represents three - quarters of pilots in the @entity2 , said demanding flight schedules and busy airline rotas were to blame			1
research by @entity117 found that half of all pilots said tiredness was ‘ the biggest threat to flight safety ’			2
some 56 per cent said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit			1
of those , 29 per cent – about one in six of all pilots – said they woke up to find their co-pilot was also asleep			1
the research was carried out ahead of a @entity141 vote on @entity143 rules for flying hours , which takes place on monday			0
@entity117 warns the new regulations will put lives at risk as they will legalise shift patterns that could see pilots kept awake for up to 24 hours			0
sir @entity23 's @entity18 admitted its plane was involved , but denied reports that both pilots were asleep at the same time			1
sir @entity23 is pictured last week at @entity155 's @entity154 in its poll of 500 pilots , 84 per cent said their flying abilities had been compromised during the past six months			0
some 43 per cent experienced problems once a month			0
only half said their airline would back them if they refused to fly because of fatigue			0
@entity117 general secretary @entity166 said : ‘ @entity2 pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face			1
’ transport ministers were warned of the dangers of sleepy pilots nine months ago , but said it was not ‘ a reported flight safety issue ’			0
a @entity20 spokesman stressed that , if approved , new @entity185 rules ‘ will increase our oversight role of airline operators and place firm obligations on airlines to introduce comprehensive fatigue - management policies and monitoring systems ’			2
a spokesman for the @entity187 added : ‘ the @entity20 is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the @entity143 as a whole			2
‘ @entity192 requirements are there to ensure that pilots and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue			2
’ they claimed the proposals ‘ go further than current requirements , by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue ’ .			0
