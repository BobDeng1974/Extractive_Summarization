politicians use gestures to strengthen the delivery of speeches , while many people shrug or move their hands wildly to make a point			1
now , scientists have shown that gesticulating while talking is part of language and affects how the meaning of words is interpreted			1
researchers believe that gestures form part of a communication system deeply ingrained in humans , which allow us to be understood			1
now , scientists have shown that gesticulating while talking is part of language and affects how the meaning of words is interpreted this might explain why many of us gesture while talking on the phone , where our actions ca n't be seen			1
dr @entity35 , a neuroscientist at the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) of @entity37 , @entity38 , who carried out the research set out to explore why humans find it difficult to keep still while speaking			1
she thinks it ’s because gestures and words ‘ very probably ’ form a single communication system , which serves to enhance expression and help us to make ourselves understood			1
‘ in human communication , voice is not sufficient : even the torso and in particular hand movements are involved , as are facial expressions , ’ she said			2
researchers believe that gestures ( pictured ) form part of a communication system deeply ingrained in humans , which allow us to be understood together with research fellow dr @entity60 , she studied prosody , which is what makes a sentence understood in a specific way and usually relies on intonation and the rhythm of language			1
for example , without prosody , nothing would distinguish the spoken statement ‘ this is an apple ’ from the ‘ this is an apple ? ’ if gestures are ingrained in humans , it might explain why many of us gesture while talking on the phone , ( stock image ) where our actions ca n't be seen in their study , published in the journal @entity84 , the experts say that prosody should include gestures			1
dr @entity60 explained : ‘ @entity91 information , for the person receiving the message , is a combination of auditory and visual cues			0
‘ the “ superior ” aspects at the cognitive processing level of spoken language are mapped to the motor - programmes responsible for the production of both speech sounds and accompanying hand gestures ’			0
to come to their conclusion , the researchers asked 20 @entity104 speakers to listen to various sentences with ambiguous meanings and watch videos of people saying the sentences			0
in the videos , the sentences could be ‘ matched ’ – when gestures corresponded to the meaning of the spoken words – or ‘ mismatched ’ when the gestures matched an alternative meaning			2
‘ in the matched conditions there was no improvement ascribable to gestures , ’ dr @entity60 said			0
‘ the participants ’ performance was very good both in the video and in the audio only sessions			0
’ he said that it is in the mismatched experiment that the effect of hand gestures became clear			0
‘ with these stimuli the subjects were much more likely to make the wrong choice - that is , they ’d choose the meaning indicated in the gestures rather than in the speech - compared to matched or audio - only conditions			2
‘ this means that gestures affect how meaning is interpreted and we believe this points to the existence of a common cognitive system for gestures , intonation and rhythm of spoken language			1
’ spontaneously moving your hands to illustrate a point can help boost a child 's language development , researchers say			0
gesture - plus - word combinations can make it easier for children to grasp what certain words and phrases mean - even during sign language			2
the findings back up previous research which found gesticulating helps youngsters develop their language , learning and cognitive skills			0
the study , released in august by dr @entity170 , from the @entity171 , examined how gesturing contributes to language learning in hearing and in deaf children			0
she concluded that gesture is a flexible way of communicating , one that can work with language to communicate or , if necessary , can itself become language .			0

scientists at the @entity36 of @entity37 , @entity38 , believe gestures as means of communication are deeply ingrained in humans
they showed how gesticulating while talking affects the meaning of words
experts think *geatures* and words ' very probably ' form a single communication system , which help us to make ourselves understood
