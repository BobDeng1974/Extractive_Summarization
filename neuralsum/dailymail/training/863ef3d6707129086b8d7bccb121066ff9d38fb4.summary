@entity1 officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because @entity3 is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum the country rejoiced when it was announced that the @entity3 is pregnant again			1
but the spare is proving as troublesome for the @entity3 as the heir – @entity1 officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because @entity3 , right , is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum			1
i was quite troubled to see this referred to by some commentators as morning sickness			1
morning sickness is a very common symptom of pregnancy , affecting about half of all expectant mothers , and it ranges from mild nausea to daily vomiting			1
it is n’t pleasant but it certainly is n’t serious			1
@entity26 , on the other hand , is brutal			1
affecting only two per cent of pregnant women , the sickness is so severe that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak			1
this often results in hospital admission – as it did when @entity3 was carrying her first child – for intravenous fluids and heavy - duty anti-sickness drugs			1
thankfully , in most cases the health of the baby is unaffected			1
the royal couple are also said to be hiring a maternity nurse , who will live with mother and baby round - the - clock			1
@entity45 and @entity3 did not do the same for @entity46 – but i say if you can afford it , go for it			1
managing with sleepless nights is one of the hardest things to get used to as a parent , and it is not necessarily easier the second time around			1
sleep deprivation is a bit like being run over by a five - ton truck every day			1
it is a big strain on both parents , and i admire the couple for coming up with a sensible strategy and admitting that they need help			1
their lives are under constant scrutiny , and i hope they will not be judged unfairly for this move			1
why i 'm forced to reveal your secrets my mother , who is in her 90s , recently had food poisoning			1
shortly after she recovered , our local council wrote to her and then called asking all sorts of questions about what she ’d eaten and where			1
my concern is that her medical information was passed on to the council without her consent			1
i thought what happened between patient and doctor was confidential ? i can reassure you that the experience your mother has had is entirely correct and permissible			1
patient confidentiality is a right of every patient , as you say , and doctors have a strict responsibility to uphold this			1
however , there are situations where confidentiality can be breached , such as in cases where protecting the health of the community overrides the individual right of a patient			1
this gives the authorities a much greater chance of preventing the spread			1
some diseases are unlikely to cause an epidemic but reveal a breakdown in hygiene that needs investigation			1
notifiable diseases are usually those that spread rapidly and are difficult to treat , or those that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of vaccine programmes			1
the list includes 30 infections , among them measles , scarlet fever , tb – and even plague			2
the full list can be found on the gov.uk website			2
as a gp , it is my statutory duty to report these diseases even when they are only suspected , rather than confirmed			2
the principle is to ensure that an outbreak is contained			2
speed is of the essence and , in order to facilitate this , a gp is obliged to provide full personal details to officials in the patient ’s local authority area			2
those officials are then able to contact the patient directly so that appropriate action can be taken to control or prevent further infection			2
i have chronic bronchitis and although i ’m not able to walk far , i do try in order to keep fit			2
my oxygen levels are normal but i still suffer from a lot of pain in my chest			2
i already use three different inhalers and my doctor says there ’s nothing more he can do			2
is there anything that you could suggest ? three million people in the @entity171 are estimated to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or @entity173 , encompassing lung conditions including emphysema and chronic bronchitis			2
they all cause narrowing of the airways in the lung and a debilitating , progressive condition that interferes with normal breathing and exercise tolerance as you describe			2
smoking is the main cause and if you are a smoker , quitting is the most important thing			2
stopping smoking can prevent the disease from worsening			2
your gp can offer you all forms of nicotine - replacement or tablets on prescription			2
inhalers are not easy to use and many @entity173 sufferers have poor technique , which leads to them being less effective			1
a practice nurse will , if asked , check your technique and offer help			2
the next step of treatment once inhalers are at a maximum level could be tablet therapy			1
it is also crucial to discuss with your gp something called pulmonary rehabilitation , a type of physical and educational treatment specifically for @entity173 sufferers who feel disabled by their condition			1
anyone in this situation who suffers chest pains should make sure their gp knows			0
the pain can be a symptom of @entity173 but also a sign of heart disease , and cardiology investigations may be needed alongside the respiratory treatments			0
@entity226 £ 80,000 for @entity227 ? are @entity229 doctors keeping life - saving treatments from young mothers dying of cancer ? the story of @entity234 , apparently saved last week by @entity236 surgeons after being refused @entity229 treatment for an ‘ inoperable ’ brain tumour , suggests they are			1
mother - of - three @entity239 was given 12 months to live , but now has had an £ 80,000 ‘ pioneering procedure ’ , reported to have extended her life by as much as 15 years			0
of course i ’m pleased for her			0
but the story is full of half - truths			0
@entity246 was given 12 months to live , but now has had an £ 80,000 ‘ pioneering procedure ' she suffers from grade two glioma – a slow - growing , difficult and unpredictable cancer			0
typically , patients live for between five and 15 years from diagnosis			0
@entity239 had already had radiotherapy , chemotherapy and surgery			0
and the procedure she paid for , awake mapping craniotomy , is offered on the @entity229			0
but she ’d suffered a stroke during the first surgery			0
@entity259 would carry a huge risk of permanent disability and offer no guarantee she would live longer , as it ’s almost impossible to remove all the cancerous cells , which do n’t show up on scans			0
@entity236 doctors agreed to operate and say they removed ‘ 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour ’			0
this sounds as if they ’ve cured her , does n’t it ? not so			0
this is medical terminology for : ‘ we ’ve got all we can see on the scans			0
’ perhaps the operation has bought her more time			0
but she may well have lived as long or longer had they done nothing			0
it ’s difficult to accept that watching and waiting can be as good as – or better than – ‘ battling ’ cancer			0
i recently read @entity280 , by @entity171 neurosurgeon @entity281			0
his more experienced self recognises that not operating often results in the same clinical outcome and life expectancy			1
@entity239 ’s @entity171 doctors would have operated if they thought it would benefit her			0
the cruel part is not that she has spent £ 80,000 – it is what she seems to think she has been given for her money			0
i was furious when told about the case of a depressed patient forced by their boss to take time off for psychotherapy as paid holiday			0
the chief medical officer ’s latest report focuses on mental health , particularly the huge toll mental illness takes on our workforce			0
it states that 17 million working days are lost each year due to stress , depression and other mental health problems , costing @entity171 up to £ 100 billion annually			0
but that figure completely misses the huge and far more significant personal costs such issues cause to individuals and their families			0
sadly , i see the problem workers face trying to access therapy – long waiting times and availability only during office hours			0
and although the example i ’ve detailed is extreme , not to mention illegal , more options should be open to all patients that will keep them living as normal a life as possible			0
the chief medical officer suggests fast - tracking workers ahead of others into therapy to improve the situation			0
but that would just create a two - tiered system , going against the principles of the @entity229			0
it would far better to legislate to ensure that employers build mental health support into the core of their working practices			0
that would help improve the situation before individuals have even reached their gp ’s surgery .			0

@entity3 is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum
vomiting can be so *relentless* that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak
this often results in hospital admission for intravenous fluids
she received treatment in hospital before the birth of baby @entity357
