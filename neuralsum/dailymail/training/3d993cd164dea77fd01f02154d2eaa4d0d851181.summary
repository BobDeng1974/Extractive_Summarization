@entity1 flanker @entity0 insists the @entity3 ' narrow loss to @entity4 proves @entity6 's men are on the verge of something ' special '			1
a sold - out @entity10 crowd thought they were witnessing history on saturday as the @entity13 pushed the world champion @entity4 close			1
skipper @entity15 fluffed a penalty 13 minutes from time which would have put the hosts on course for their very first win against the @entity21 after 109 years of trying			1
@entity1 flanker @entity0 ( right ) feels the full force of @entity24 's tackle at @entity10 but with that let off , @entity28 's @entity27 giants romped down to the pitch and grabbed what proved to be the winning try when @entity32 found a rare gap in the @entity13 defence to seal a 24 - 16 win			1
it was cruel luck for @entity1 but having shipped 100 points and 13 tries in their previous two encounters against @entity4 , the evidence of progress under @entity44 coach @entity6 is clear to see			1
it was also the first time the @entity3 had come within 10 points of the @entity4 since losing the 1991 @entity48 third - place play - off			1
@entity15 missed a late penalty that would have given @entity1 the lead with 10 minutes remaining now @entity53 back - rower @entity51 believes that with another @entity48 around the corner next year , @entity1 can start dreaming of another run to the latter stages			1
they have one final chance to hone their game plan before the @entity61 gets under way in february when they take on @entity63 at @entity65 's @entity64 on saturday but @entity51 insists there is no holding back @entity6 's side			1
he said : ' you have got to be real about it , it was still a loss on saturday			2
if you are going to accept defeats then you may as well give up there			0
all blacks lock @entity75 crossed for a try soon after to seal @entity4 's narrow victory ' we are bitterly disappointed with the loss but there are a lot of positives we can build on			1
it 's not a negative loss if you want to put it that way			2
' there is a sense that something is growing in this squad			0
it 's very special and perfectly - timed with the @entity61 and @entity48 coming up			2
' but as quickly as things are built , they can be dismantled			0
' we have to stay clear - headed and keep progressing			2
we have a big game next week against @entity63 , so we have to get back to work quickly			2
' we feel we are heading towards something special			0
we are a team on the up			0
@entity4 - born flanker @entity51 admitted it was an emotional experience facing the haka last saturday ' the unity amongst the squad and the sense that we are going somewhere is amazing			1
' saturday 's match pulled at @entity51 's heart strings			2
born and raised in the small town of @entity107 , near @entity108 , the 28 - year - old turned his back on his hopes of ever pulling on an @entity4 jersey during the summer when he was called up to represent the land of his @entity114 - born mother @entity113			1
in the days before the second autumn test with @entity4 , he spoke about how tough it would be to stare down the haka while wearing a @entity1 shirt			1
but @entity51 revealed he worked hard all week in the build - up focusing his mind not to let the emotions take over			0
' there were all sorts of things gong through my head before the kick - off , ' he said			0
' it was an amazing experience for me - a lot of pride in myself for getting to where i am now			0
' as i watched the haka , it was a bit of home coming at me and it was something i will cherish for the rest of my life			0
' but once the game kicked - off i never let the emotions take off			0
it was big for me personally and i had a lot of family there too , so it was something i was clear about all week			0
' i just tried to remember all the jobs i had to do			0
you do want to use some of the emotion but as soon as your mind lets the emotion take over is when you start making silly mistakes			0
