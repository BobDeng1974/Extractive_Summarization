a shocking picture has emerged of an inmate who was viciously beaten by guards while handcuffed at a @entity4 prison			1
a judge on monday recommended that six @entity4 jail guards be fired for the brutal 2012 beating of a handcuffed @entity8 inmate in a now - shuttered solitary confinement dorm for mentally ill prisoners			1
the beating left 27 - year - old @entity12 with a broken nose , fractured back and a bloodied , badly swollen face			1

on monday , a judge recommended that six @entity4 jail guards be fired for the brutal beating of the handcuffed @entity8 inmate in a now - shuttered solitary confinement dorm the @entity21 said @entity12 was beaten after being carried hogtied into a cell for refusing to be escorted and that to justify the use of force , the guards fabricated a story that @entity12 put one of them in a chokehold the recommendation in the @entity21 's disciplinary case against the five correction officers and a captain was meant to serve as an example and deter other jail workers ' who would participate in or stand idly by when such brazen misconduct occurs , ' judge @entity29 said			1
' individuals who themselves are out of control can not be made the overlords of any group of inmates , ' the judge wrote			0
the @entity21 said @entity12 was beaten after being carried hogtied into a cell for refusing to be escorted and that to justify the use of force , the guards fabricated a story that @entity12 put one of them in a chokehold			1
the recommendation comes in the wake of months of headline - grabbing tales of guard misconduct and the maltreatment of inmates in the nation 's second - largest jail system			2
in march , based on an internal city health study , it was found that nearly a third of @entity8 inmates who said their visible injuries came at the hands of a correction officer last year had suffered a blow to the head			2
and last month , a federal review of @entity8 by government lawyers found a ' deep - seated ' culture of violence in the 10 - facility jail complex on the 400 - acre island off @entity73 's shores			2
but the recommendation also provides a small window into the world of internal discipline in the @entity21			2
a federal review of @entity8 by government lawyers found a ' deep - seated ' culture of violence in the 10 - facility jail complex on the 400 - acre island off @entity73 's shores in the past four and a half years , the department brought 2,007 administrative cases before the @entity84 , according to records			0
of those , only 97 resulted in a written report and recommendation			0
most cases were settled in exchange for the forfeiture of vacation days and unpaid suspensions , while the details of the incident and names of those involved remain secret			0
in @entity12 's case , surveillance video showed the 6 - foot - 3 man carried into his cell by captain @entity102 and other guards , shackled by his hands and feet and lifted off the ground , the judge wrote			1
the guards involved said @entity12 - described by the judge as a @entity110 gang member with an attempted murder conviction - kicked @entity102 twice and put another correction officer in a headlock , resulting in a struggle that led to his injuries			1
@entity12 's version of events , combined with inmate witnesses and surveillance video outside the cell was more believable , @entity29 wrote , ultimately determining he had remained handcuffed as the guards , some wearing gloves , beat him while an officer calmly stood outside the cell			1
' this case appears to combine some of the worst aspects of the use of force cases : a coordinated effort to enter an inmate 's cell , serious physical injury , an attempted cover - up , and a lack of provocation by the inmate , ' @entity29 wrote			1
@entity12 is suing the city in federal court			2
@entity102 's attorney , @entity139 , said the judge 's recommendation was ' very disappointing '			0
@entity142 , head of the @entity143 , said he would ask commissioner @entity144 to spare the five officers termination			0
he said the case , while unfortunate , was reflective of a department that lacked sufficient supervisory staff where unqualified captains are promoted			0
surveillance video did n't capture what occurred inside the cell , only in the corridor outside			0
department of correction lawyers have denied the public records request for the footage , as well as the appeal of the denial , arguing in part that the footage was a personnel record and exempt from public disclosure			0
but the video was played publicly during @entity102 's hearing this spring before the @entity84 , and inmate advocate @entity165 , who watched the video , said it was disturbing how eerily calm the guards appeared in the footage			0
' i remember it hit me like a brick , ' she said , noting that about 10 minutes passed before @entity12 was brought out of the cell , limp , and placed face - down on a gurney and rushed to a hospital			1
' you can only imagine what 's happening in there			0
a man who is cuffed , and without weapons , is now in there with all these guys ... it 's just very disturbing			0

the beating left 27 - year - old @entity12 with a broken nose , fractured back and a bloodied , badly swollen face
he was being held at a now - shuttered solitary confinement dorm for mentally ill prisoners in 2012 when he was beaten
the @entity21 said @entity12 was beaten after being carried hogtied into a cell for refusing to be escorted
to justify the use of force , the guards fabricated a story that @entity12 put one of them in a chokehold
