@entity0 came on for the second half of @entity2 's friendly against @entity3 , despite bizarrely not being initially named on the bench by @entity5			1
less than a day after @entity7 raised doubts about the £ 27million signing 's fitness it initially appeared he had been snubbed by his new manager with @entity12 preferred at left wing back			1
the former @entity15 full - back trained on his own at @entity17 ' @entity16 just hours before kick - off on tuesday night			1
he had also trained alone on monday night while @entity7 put the rest of the squad through ball drills			2
asked at a post-training press conference why @entity0 worked alone , @entity2 manager @entity7 said : ' i am always a trainer who sees the individuals and what each player needs			1
' @entity0 needs to be fit and he ’s not very fit and ca n’t perform how i want			2
he needs to be fit and to train individually			0
' i ca n’t judge why			0
i see what i see			0
i have spoken with him and we have made a programme with him			0
we will have to see how long it takes			0
' i have heard good messages from @entity43 the fitness coach			0
' u-turn : @entity7 puts an arm around @entity0 before @entity2 's friendly against @entity3 in @entity47 tough stance : the @entity50 coach told reporters he did not think @entity0 was fit enough since returning from @entity52			1

@entity0 was signed for £ 27million from @entity15 earlier this *summer*
when @entity7 took over he made it clear that @entity0 and @entity55 were players he wanted @entity2 to sign
the left - back played the first half of @entity2 's 7 - 0 win over @entity62 and the second half of their 3 - 2 *victory* against @entity65
he was not named on the bench for friendly against @entity3 in @entity47 but still came on at half - time
in tuesday 's press conference @entity7 said @entity0 was not fit enough
