wealth : sir @entity1 of advertising giant @entity2 was the highest earning @entity3 executive last year , raking in £ 29.8million bosses as @entity6 's biggest companies saw their taxable pay soar by 15 per cent last year , bringing the average salary of a @entity3 chief executive to a staggering £ 4.72million			1
the increase , up from £ 4.1million in 2012 , means it now takes the head of a top company just two days to earn £ 26,500 - the total amount the average @entity6 worker is paid in an entire year			1
the news comes as millions of @entity6 face hardship following years of pay freezes and pitiful rises below the rate of inflation , and further highlights the growing divide between the super-wealthy and those struggling to make ends meet			1
sir @entity1 of advertising giant @entity2 was the highest earning @entity3 executive last year , raking in £ 29.8million in just 12 months , according to a study by investor research company @entity28			1
his taxable remuneration package , which includes base pay , pensions and long - term bonuses cashed in 2013 , was almost three times higher than any other company boss			1
in second place was @entity36 of financial investment firm @entity37 with £ 10.1million , while @entity38 of life insurance and financial services multinational @entity41 earned £ 8.6million			0
in fact @entity1 's record - breaking pay was so high that nearly 30 per cent of @entity2 shareholders refused to back the package at a meeting last year			1
the figures are based on the taxable income of @entity3 chief executives , not their basic salary , as such a great deal of their remuneration comes in the form of bonuses and reward schemes			2

the figures are based on the taxable income of @entity3 chief executives , not their basic salary , as such a great deal of their remuneration comes in the form of bonus schemes based on stock market performance pay day : the third highest earning @entity3 executive last year was @entity38 ( left ) of @entity41			1
meanwhile @entity66 boss @entity65 ( right ) was in fifth place with an income of £ 8.3million 1			0

@entity77 ( @entity78 ) - £ 7.4m 10			0
@entity79 ( @entity80 ) - £ 7.3m @entity81 says the 15 per cent rise in executive pay is not surprising , as many receive bonuses in the form of company shares linked to stock market performance , which has been strong for @entity3 companies over the past three years			1
when the figures are adjusted to strip out stock market performance related pay and leave only remuneration packages agreed in advance , the numbers are quite different			0
this data measure - known as @entity97 - suggests the average pay for a @entity3 executive actually fell by seven per cent last year , following a fall of five per cent in 2012			1
despite this the research will make uncomfortable reading for campaigners who have long argued that executive pay is excessive			0

news comes as millions of @entity6 suffer pay freezes that have lasted years
