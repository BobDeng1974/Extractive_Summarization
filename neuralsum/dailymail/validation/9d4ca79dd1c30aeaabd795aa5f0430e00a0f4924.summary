@entity1 striker @entity0 will step out at @entity2 on wednesday looking to boost his side 's @entity4 survival hopes at the expense of the team he has been strongly linked with a move to at the end of the season			1
@entity12 has refused to be drawn on speculation suggesting that @entity0 , who is out of contract at the end of the campaign , will move to @entity17			1
but if he does sign a contract at @entity2 , will he be good enough to make the grade ? @entity21 's reporters give their verdict			1
@entity0 ( centre ) has been @entity1 's star player as they try to stay in the @entity4 this season @entity24 yes , he is good enough to make the step up			1
it is no mean effort scoring nine goals in the @entity4 for a side that has struggled to get results and @entity0 has never been found wanting at the biggest stadiums			1
he was outstanding in @entity1 ’s 3 - 1 loss at @entity33 last month , his energy and intensity setting him apart that night			2
it was not a one - off because he has attracted positive reviews all season			0
@entity0 scored for @entity1 against @entity40 in his side 's 3 - 1 defeat and impressed with his display ings could replace @entity44 at @entity17 , with the @entity45 expected to depart at the end of the season @entity0 has scored nine times for @entity1 this season and will take on @entity17 on wednesday read @entity51 's piece on why @entity0 would flourish under the guidance of @entity17 manager @entity12 @entity17 will overhaul their striking department in the summer , with potentially three players moving – @entity55 , @entity44 and @entity56 – and a move for @entity0 would make sense from both a playing style and an economic point of view			1
he will have to raise his game again should he eventually arrive at @entity2 , but that wo n’t be a problem			2
@entity0 has been doing that for the last two years and he will welcome the challenge			2
@entity66 @entity0 is one of those players who does n't have one quality that makes him stand out , but he does n't have an obvious weakness either			2
he is an intelligent player and at 22 has the potential to get better			0
he is a good finisher but his tally of nine this season is unremarkable and five fewer than @entity74 at @entity75 for example			0
@entity0 watches on as his shot hits the back of the net for @entity1 against @entity75 @entity17 manager @entity12 has refused to comment on the speculation linking the club with @entity0 ings can show he is capable of playing on the big stage when he plays for @entity1 against @entity17 ings could make the step up to a big club but there is no guarantee			1
you suspect @entity17 's real interest in him is due to @entity92 's moneyball approach to the game			2
why would n't you take a promising 22 - year - old on a @entity95 given you could sell him in two years for a handsome profit , even if he does n't become a first - team regular ? @entity98 there was a moment when it became clear to me that @entity0 was good enough to make the grade at the very highest level and it came early in last month ’s defeat at @entity40			2
the way he showed @entity108 to the front post before checking back and heading in @entity1 ’s goal – by now unmarked – at the far post told you everything you need to know about his natural instincts as a goal scorer			0
it was high - class finishing			0
@entity0 ' form has also led to talk that @entity118 manager @entity117 ( left ) will include him in his next squad @entity0 beats defender @entity120 and goalkeeper @entity121 to score against @entity122 earlier in the season – as he started the campaign slowly – i was n’t sure but he has found his feet now and has emerged as a safe bet for the next @entity118 squad			0
on that note , i wrote a story last season saying that @entity0 was being watched by @entity117 ’s staff and was likely to figure in the national set - up during the @entity134 qualifiers			0
i remember one of my colleagues laughing			0
he is n’t laughing any more …			0
@entity137 there ’s no doubting the drive and determination of a striker who was playing for @entity143 in the @entity144 a little over four years ago , and @entity0 will be desperate to put on a performance at @entity2			1
is he good enough to make the step up to @entity17 ? compared with the players @entity12 currently has at his disposal , you would have to say yes			1
@entity0 has scored nine goals in the @entity4 for a @entity1 side that has spent the entire season battling the odds – the same amount as @entity155 ’s new £ 25m signing @entity156 and @entity158 ’s @entity157 , and more than @entity17 forwards @entity160 , @entity56 , @entity55 , @entity44 and @entity161 put together			1
@entity0 has scored the same number of @entity4 goals as @entity156 and @entity157 @entity0 is only 22 and fits the profile of player that @entity17 often pursue in the transfer market a player who scored 26 goals in the @entity170 last season has also hit four in seven appearances for @entity172 to stake his claim for a senior international call - up , so there is little doubt that he is capable of rising to the challenge			1
@entity0 is not excessively tall or powerful , but he is quick and possesses great movement and anticipation in and around the penalty box			0
most importantly of all , he has a goalscorer ’s instinct			0
and at the age of 22 , he is young enough to take his game to another level under a coach like @entity12 .			0

@entity0 has scored nine times for @entity1 in the @entity4
he has been strongly linked with @entity17 and faces them on wednesday
@entity21 's reporters give their verdict on if he is good enough for @entity2
read : ings would flourish at @entity17 under the guidance of @entity12
