one of the less celebrated aspects of @entity2 ’s remarkable career were his regular appearances in that part of the press box which houses the written journalists			1
@entity2 was first and foremost a television broadcaster , a man of unusually wry wit who once responded on air to colleague @entity12 ’s malapropism ( ‘ honestly , you run out of expletives when describing the fielding of @entity16 ’ ) without skipping a beat : ‘ which particular one did you have in mind ? ’ but @entity2 also penned a regular column for the @entity21 , taking his place among the hacks – not all tv men take the trouble – to craft his copy whenever a test match was going on			1
@entity2 , pictured in january 2013 , has died at the age of 84 after a battle with skin cancer @entity2 was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge tributes are seen at the statue of @entity2 at the @entity37 after his passing it was said he would regularly file 700 or 800 words , of which maybe 150 or 200 would see the light of day			1
but , a professional to his core , @entity2 kept on filing			1
he loved cricket , and he loved conveying his love , by visual means or verbal			2
that much was evident during his playing days			0
he won 63 test caps between january 1952 and february 1964 , collecting 248 wickets with his leg - spin ( at a very good average of 27 ) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24			0
but it was the style as much as the stats			2
it was often an understated era , typified by @entity59 ’s steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against @entity62 at @entity63 in 1956 ( @entity2 c @entity64 0 ; @entity65 18 )			1
@entity2 did his best to change all that			1
@entity67 was fun , emotional and human : if he got a wicket , he ’d do more than hitch his trousers up , @entity64 - style			2
he ’d whoop and skip and jump : take a look on @entity72 at him enjoying @entity74 ’s slip catch at @entity63 in 1961 , where his leg - breaks spirited @entity62 to a come - from - behind win			1
these days players go further than that			0
but @entity2 was their spiritual forefather			1
he loved not just cricket , but cricketers too			2
not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in @entity85 ’s rebellious @entity84 in the late 1970s			0
but @entity84 eventually forced the establishment ’s hand			0
cricketers were soon paid a living wage , not the honorariums they had previously endured			0
@entity2 ’s involvement and influence were central to that			1
it was as a tv commentator that @entity2 came into his own			1
when @entity97 asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters , he suggested : ‘ put your brain into gear before opening your mouth			0
’ that style – laconic , considered , dry – would become his hallmark , together with an unfailing greeting : ‘ good morning , everyone			2
’ when @entity2 welcomed viewers , they were able to relax : the cricket was about to begin			1
there were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly , to air his opinions more clearly			0
surely , you wondered , he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front - foot no - ball law			0
but it was not his style – and he remained true to himself			0
‘ above all , ’ he told @entity97 , ‘ when commentating , do n’t take yourself too seriously , and have fun			0
’ @entity2 was @entity62 captain and the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests after his playing career , @entity2 forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator @entity2 ( right ) in discussion with @entity130 's @entity129 ahead of a test match in 2004 that last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of @entity136 commentators in @entity62			1
and if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths , then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by @entity2 himself			1
his successors were always going to pale by comparison			0
behind it all was a quiet , imposing strength			0
the first time i met him , @entity2 almost broke my fingers with his handshake			2
as a friend noted : ‘ you do n’t get to captain @entity62 with a limp wrist			2
’ good night , everyone .			0
