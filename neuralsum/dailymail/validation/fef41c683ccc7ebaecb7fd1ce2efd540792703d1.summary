i just loved seeing @entity1 celebrate his goal			1
it is a load of tosh when a former player does n’t celebrate against his old team			2
goalscoring is why we play / watch / support — and it ’s a while since @entity1 scored one ! @entity11 did n’t want to keep him , he left for @entity12 and here he was back at @entity13 scoring a predatory winner			1
@entity1 rounded @entity15 to score @entity12 's winner against @entity11 @entity1 latched on to an weak pass from @entity18 to take the ball past @entity15 and score @entity1 ( left ) celebrated his goal at @entity13 despite the fact he used to play for @entity11 of course he should enjoy it			1
before his goal , watching @entity1 for an hour was awkward tv			1
the ball was bouncing away from him			0
he looked desperate at times			0
even when he went down in the box , i thought he could have gone on to get a shot away			0
how much did he want to get into that position to shoot ? if you look at @entity30 striker @entity29 , he just lives for the chances , but as soon as the ball drops for @entity1 , it ’s as if you can hear his pulse racing through the tv and nerves get the better of him			2
there are lots of things you can work on in football , but goalscorers have that ice in their veins , like @entity44 , @entity45 or @entity46			0
it was staggering that @entity48 did not turn to @entity49			2
the poor lad must be thinking : what am i doing here ? @entity48 did not use striker @entity49 to rescue the game against @entity12 at @entity13 @entity55 ( right ) was brought on at half - time but @entity57 forward @entity49 was unused i know he is not the player @entity11 thought they were getting , but is n’t it down to the manager to get the best out of him ? goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with @entity65 and @entity55 , two sitting midfielders , on the pitch			1
the defending from @entity11 for @entity12 ’s first goal was unbelievable ! yes , it was a fantastic goal for @entity12 but the defending from @entity11 was @entity71 ’s not about tactics , that ’s players needing to tackle			1
three @entity11 players failed to stop @entity75 as he ran at them and @entity18 – who was playing at right back – turned his back on the @entity12 player			1
@entity79 wheels away to celebrate scoring @entity12 's first goal against @entity11 at @entity13 @entity75 breezed through the @entity11 defence to provide an assist for the @entity84 goal you can not do that			1
@entity87 was in the studio but he must have been thinking he should be putting his boots back on			0
even @entity87 , at 43,would have put up more resistance			0
@entity75 does very well , driving forward and creating the opening ( it was nice skill from @entity94 in the build up too ) , but they can not be allowed to do that			0
this fixture used to have @entity98 , but these two midfields were packed with different players and nobody more bold than @entity102			0
@entity102 ( second right ) was in inspirational form as @entity12 secured a place in the @entity106 semi-final he does n’t crash into tackles , but he has a different type of courage ; courage on the ball			1
he ’ll take it in tight areas , uses both feet and always likes to get the play moving			0
i could watch him all day			0
@entity12 were shot to pieces in the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity120 and if it had been down to me , per mertesacker would never have played for them again after his display that night			2
but his performance at @entity13 showed character and a welcome return to form			0
per @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) were particularly impressive for @entity12 at @entity13 @entity128 is another who stood out here			2
@entity129 will come through this , but he is playing like he has the handbrake on			2
is he being overcoached ? what has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for @entity136 ? he is only 19 and he will come again , but the player @entity11 signed for £ 30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch			1
he is n’t doing that now			0
it looks to me as if he ’s thinking too much and that will be down to him trying to carry out instructions			0
@entity129 did n't enjoy his best night for @entity11 and has struggled to recapture his @entity136 form @entity150 's tireless work for @entity11 made him one of their standout players against @entity12 he is going to be a star , but when you consider how @entity154 is developing , why is n’t @entity129 doing the same ? he is a young man , who has had his injuries , but he is struggling and was taken off at half - time in a reshuffle that ultimately did n’t pay off			1
it is strange watching @entity11 and when their best player is @entity150 then it shows where they are			1
i ’m not a @entity150 fan , but he is working hard and looks the player most likely to get them out of this hole			1
the irony is that he is a signing made by @entity169			0

@entity1 struck @entity12 's @entity106 winner against @entity11
he celebrated the goal and received a mixed *reception* when *substituted*
@entity150 was @entity11 's best player but @entity129 struggled
@entity11 and @entity12 special : are fans right to *question* @entity48 ?
