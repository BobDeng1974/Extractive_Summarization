it was a coal freighter that overturned in a horrific storm in 1940 , sinking , along with the 32 crew aboard , 210 feet below the surface of @entity4 , just off the coast of @entity6			1
while the shipwreck of the @entity9 was finally found , upside down , by divers in 1972 , an investigation into why it sank was deemed all but impossible , due to the murkiness of the water			1
a group of @entity15 - based explorers believe they have determined what caused the @entity9 to succumb to the 30 - foot waves brought on by ferocious blizzard			1
the reason for its sinking was unknown wreck : the ship sits upside down on the shore of @entity4 , 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of @entity6			1
because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water , investigations were n't possible the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization , were able to make their way down to the wreck on a clear day last fall			1
the dive allowed for the first - known footage of the ship to be taken			2
the footage , taken by @entity37 diver @entity45 , of @entity46 , showed a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade			1
' the waves were so strong , they must have snapped the rudder 's connection , at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller , ' @entity45 told @entity56			2
' with no power or steering , the @entity9 would have been at the mercy of the storm			1
' the @entity9 had little warning the storm was to hit on november 11 , 1940			1
with 75 mph winds , 30 - foot waves and rain turning to snow , it is still referred to as ' the most disastrous day in the history of @entity4 shipping '			1
discovery : during a dive last fall , the @entity37 ( @entity70 ) , a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization were able to capture the first - ever footage of the wreck , determining a rudder the broke in the storm struck the propeller ( pictured ) taking coal to @entity24 , the @entity9 went down five miles out from @entity80 between @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity6 , @entity4			1
another ship , cargo carrier the @entity85 , also went down , along with all 24 aboard , while several other ships were damaged and ran aground			0
@entity37 board member , @entity87 , further explained what caused the @entity9 to sink			2
' it would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode , ' he told @entity94			0
' without the rudder , it would n't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you ca n't drive it forward			2
' the ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship			0
' ' x ' marks the spot : the shipwreck of the @entity105 five miles out from @entity80 between @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity6 , @entity4			0
the freighter was en route to @entity24 when it sank the @entity37 was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the @entity9 after the waters of @entity4 started to clear in recent years			2
' we decided to give it a shot , ' @entity87 said			0
" the divers did n't even use a light for the discovery			0
' it 's not as warm as it is in the @entity117 , but it 's certainly starting to rival it in clarity			0
' it was a warm , sunny day			0
' the ambient light was amazing			0
' the @entity9 was a lake freighter that was constructed in 1907 by @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126			0

the @entity9 *capsized* during a storm on november 11 , 1940
it sank 210 feet below the surface of @entity4 , landing upside down
its landing and the murkiness of the water made investigations *difficult*
divers were able to get the wreck last fall and take footage
they determined the rudder broke in the storm and snapped the propeller
with no power or steering , the ship succumbed to 30 - foot waves
