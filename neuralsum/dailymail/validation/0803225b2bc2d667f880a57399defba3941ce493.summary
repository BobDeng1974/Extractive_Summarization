getting a job lifts more people out of poverty in @entity4 than anywhere in @entity6 , a new study reveals			2
more than seven in 10 people in the @entity4 were no longer in poverty after finding work , compared to the @entity12 average of just half			1
ministers said the figures showed @entity4 was leading the way in proving that work is the best route out of being poor			1
seven in 10 people in the @entity4 were no longer classed as poor after finding work , compared to the @entity12 average of just half in work poverty rates have been lower in the @entity4 than the @entity12 average every year since 2006 , the figures show the @entity21 examined figures for every @entity6 country to analyse the impact getting a job can have on people classed as poor			1
it found gaining employment helped far more people out of poverty than the rest of the continent			2
someone is classed as living in poverty if their disposable income is less than 60 per cent of the national average			0
people living in ' in - work poverty ' are both below the poverty threshold and in employment themselves			2
for the @entity12 as a whole , only half of people ( 49 per cent ) left poverty when they got a job in 2009 , according to analysis carried out by the @entity48			2
detailed figures by country suggest the @entity4 has a higher poverty exit rate for people getting a job than almost any other country examined			1
the @entity21 said : ' the percentage of people who moved out of poverty when entering employment in the @entity4 was relatively stable and well above the @entity12 average throughout the period 2007 to 2012 , with an exit rate of 68 per cent in 2007 to 2009 , compared with 73 per cent in 2010 to 2012			1
' by contrast , the poverty exit rate was lowest in @entity64 just 23 per cent of people left poverty after getting a job			1
in @entity68 just 36 per cent were lifted out of poverty and @entity70 37 per cent			0
in @entity72 the figure was 70 per cent , followed by @entity73 ( 66 per cent ) , @entity74 ( 64 per cent ) and @entity75 and @entity76 , both 62 per cent			0
the @entity77 have argued that the introduction of @entity79 , which combines six benefits into one , will ensure that work always pays and is guaranteed to lift people out of poverty if they get a job			0
work and pensions secretary @entity85 said the research showed work is the best route out of poverty increasing hours and getting a pay rise were key routes to moving out of in work poverty , the @entity21 said work and pensions secretary @entity85 said : ' our welfare reforms are designed to support people to move off benefits and into a job - to move from dependence to independence			1
' we 've always known that work is the best route out of poverty - and we now see that this is more pronounced in the @entity4 compared to rest of @entity6			1
' we have more people in work than ever before , and poverty in this country is at the lowest level since the mid 1980 's			2
' @entity79 will build on this record - ensuring sure work always pays , and making three million households better off			0
' according to the @entity21 , 8 per cent of working people aged 18 - 64 were in poverty in 2013 , some 3million in total			0
by contrast 31 per cent of those not in work were in poverty			0
the data shows people taking up full - time jobs of 30 or more hours per week are more likely to move out of poverty when entering employment ( 76 per cent ) than those who get a part - time job ( 62 per cent )			1
whether a job is permamnent or temporary makes little difference to the impact on someone being in poverty			0
the @entity21 added : ' unsurprisingly , those moving out of poverty have a substantially higher rate of hourly pay than those who remain below the poverty threshold			0
this is the case for both full - time and part - time workers			0

seven in 10 @entity4 moved out of poverty after entering employment
average across the @entity12 was less than half , figures show
poverty exit rate was lowest in @entity64 where just 23 *%* were helped
@entity85 says work is always ' the best route out of poverty '
