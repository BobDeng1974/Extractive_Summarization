' he breached his responsibility , i think , as an adult and as a leader in his relationship			0
and i think that ’s very unfortunate			0
' but i do n't think that 's @entity10 's to explain			1
she has her own record , her own vision for where she would take the country			0
' and i think that 's something which will be debated extensively during the 2016 campaign			1
' @entity5 's sexual relationship with @entity33 , who at the time was a 22 - year - old @entity38 intern , led to his impeachment in 1998 and subsequent trial			1

@entity10 is expected to enter the 2016 presidential campaign ' he took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office			1
' there is no excuse for that , and that is predatory behavior , and it should be something we should n't want to associate with people who would take advantage of a young girl in his office			0
' this is n't having an affair			0
i mean , this is n't me saying , ' oh , he 's had an affair , we should n't talk to him			0
' ' someone who takes advantage of a young girl in their office ? i mean , really			0
and then [ @entity64 ] have the gall to stand up and say , ' @entity73 are having a war on women ' ? ' so , yes , i think it 's a factor			0
now , it 's not @entity10 's fault			1
