by @entity0 @entity1 is feeling blessed			1
a year ago , facing his 60th birthday and unhappy with work , his wife advised him to make a wish list of things he wanted to achieve and three have come true			2
says @entity1 , ' i wrote " join a soap " - i wanted to be in @entity10 – and i am ! i was also keen to move out of @entity12 and we 're now in @entity14			1
and the @entity16 stage was on the list and i got a role in the musical @entity19 ! it 's absolutely amazing			1
' the @entity19 song @entity21 could be his theme tune and the @entity26 host says he always tries to be cheery when things seem bleak			2
@entity1 says that he is a really happy place having found his dream role and finding true love , he has completely overcome his past daemons like after his car - crash appearance on celebrity big brother in 2002 during his split from wife @entity35 – he was sad and emotional on camera – which saw him branded ' @entity37 '			1
' @entity33 was n't my finest hour , ' says @entity1			1
' i did it for a career boost but it did n't work out like that			0
but i believe if you stay positive and ask the @entity46 , things will come to you			0
' and they did , in the shape of @entity49 , who gave @entity1 a role – as an exaggerated version of the downtrodden character the public had seen on @entity54 – in his comedy series @entity56			1
' i encouraged @entity57 to go as far as he wanted with the character because i did n't see myself as this sad loser			0
extras changed the public 's perception of me hugely			1
i 'll always be grateful to him for giving me that chance , ' he says			0
@entity1 says that his most embarrassing was on his first day : ' the first thing i had to do on @entity10 was run out of @entity67 's house chased by @entity68 ( far right )			1
but instead of jumping into my own bashed - up van i got into a shiny @entity70 belonging to one of the crew ! we had to film it again , but as it was my first time on set , hopefully it can be forgiven ! ' now @entity1 ca n't believe he 's in the show he watched from its start in 1960			1
@entity1 , who 'd become fed up with touring in theatre productions when he got the call to audition for the role of @entity10 crook @entity83 , says , ' i have to pinch myself – it 's the ultimate job			1
' he adds that all his showbiz experience counted for nothing when he ventured onto the show 's most iconic set			2
' when i filmed my first scene in @entity90 i felt overawed			0
it was one of the most nerve - racking things i 've done			0
' last week , @entity1 's character @entity94 came face - to - face with his burglary victim @entity67 as part of a restorative justice scheme – and they 're set to strike up a relationship			1
could he be @entity67 's fifth husband ? ' maybe i could be one that lasts – @entity67 could use some luck ! ' @entity1 met his wife @entity103 , a life coach 18 years his junior , in 2005			1
they had daughter @entity106 in 2008 and son @entity107 in 2011			0
in between , the pair married			0
it was ' third time lucky ' for @entity1 , who has a grown - up son , @entity110 , from his first marriage to @entity112 , and split from his second wife , @entity116 's @entity115 judge @entity35 , after she cheated on him with actor @entity117			1
says @entity1 , ' i 'm an eternal optimist and a romantic , so i had the chance to get it right			1
i feel so settled and happy and blessed			2
i have a wonderful woman who looks out for me			2
' cats or dogs ? both ! we have two dogs - @entity126 - poodle crosses called @entity127 and @entity128 - as well as a cat called @entity130			0
holidays , @entity132 or @entity133 ? i love the @entity134 in @entity135 - we rent a gîte there every year			0
pizza or pasta ? @entity140 's my favourite but i have n't had it for ages as i 'm not eating wheat as part of a 5:2 diet			2
i miss it ! goodfellas or @entity147 ? the @entity147			0
i still get nervous at the really tense bits			0
@entity149 or @entity150 ? i have an @entity151 - i like reliable cars , not fancy ones			0
rugby or football ? @entity156 - i 'm a massive @entity158 fan			0
outdoors or sofa ? i walk and walk			0
it 's when i can think about stuff .			2
