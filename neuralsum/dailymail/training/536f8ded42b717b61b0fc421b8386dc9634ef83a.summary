gps who repeatedly fail to spot crucial signs of cancer are to be named and shamed under radical new plans being drawn up by ministers			1
health secretary @entity5 has vowed to root out doctors who cost patients ’ lives by failing to send them for vital hospital tests soon enough			1
family doctors found to be dismissing cancer symptoms as something less serious will be identified with a ‘ red flag ’ on an @entity15 website			1
health secretary @entity5 , who has vowed to root out doctors who cost lives by failing to send patients for vital hospital tests soon enough figures show that one in ten cancer sufferers have had to see their gp at least five times before being referred to hospital to be diagnosed			1
last night mr @entity5 told @entity23 : ‘ we need to do much better			2
cancer diagnosis levels around the country vary significantly and we must do much more to improve both the level of diagnosis and to bring those gp practices with poor referral rates up to the standards of the best			0
’ every year 80,000 people – a quarter of all new cancer cases – are only diagnosed at @entity34 , in part because gps miss so many			1
@entity37 , pictured with his mother @entity38 , left , and his girlfriend @entity39 , right			0
ms @entity38 visited her gp 15 times before being referred to hospital for tests last night families who had lost loved ones because @entity36 had failed to spot cancer welcomed the move			1
@entity48 , whose mother @entity38 had to see a gp 15 times before being referred for tests , said : ‘ rating family doctors on cancer is essential			1
my mum was made to feel she was wasting the doctors ’ time when she was actually very ill. ’ under the government ’s planned reforms , surgeries will be ranked as ‘ green ’ for cancer on the @entity61 website if they quickly refer patients to hospital when they are showing possible signs of cancer			1
but if they miss too many cancer cases – or if patients have to return numerous times before being sent for tests – they will be classed as ‘ red ’			1
where there is insufficient data to reach a firm conclusion , patients will be told just that			0
meanwhile , @entity77 insiders have revealed they are looking at a range of other @entity15 initiatives which include : experts have found @entity81 lags behind other @entity83 countries when it comes to cancer survival rates , and that the main reason is late diagnosis			1
if @entity81 ’s cancer survival record matched the @entity83 average , at least 5,000 fewer people would die of the disease in the @entity81 each year			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i want @entity81 to be among the best in @entity83 for cancer survival and early diagnosis plays a crucial role in achieving that			1
’ but the @entity97 of @entity36 has criticised the proposed rating system as ‘ crude ’ and said the government should be ‘ supporting gps , not criticising them ’			2
there are also fears the plan could prompt @entity36 to send in patients indiscriminately for cancer tests - flooding hospital specialists with overwhelmingly healthy patients			1
however , mechanical engineer mr @entity48 , 29 , said the rating system was ‘ really needed ’ to stop tragedies such as the death of his mother			2
she died of cancer last november , just three months after being diagnosed – but wasted eight months going back and forth to her gp surgery in @entity114 , @entity115 , complaining of severe but unexplained back pain			2
more than once she was sent to a physiotherapist , who kept returning her to the gp knowing the pain was ‘ not muscular ’			2
the delay meant her cancer spread beyond her pancreas into her liver , lungs and spleen , and by the time it was diagnosed last august it was inoperable			0
@entity129 , who had several visits to her gp before she was eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer mr @entity48 said : ‘ we put our trust in doctors and when you are told there ’s nothing wrong , you go away believing it			1
if there ’s a system that shows your local doctor is not good at spotting cancer , then you might go elsewhere			0
’ doctors believed mother - of - two @entity129 was too young for bowel cancer , even though she told them her aunt had died of it at 50			2
when the marketing executive first visited her gp in @entity149 , @entity150 , and raised the possibility she was told it was ‘ most unlikely ’ her constant stomach pains and other symptoms were caused by cancer			1
at the time she was 45			0
she recalled : ‘ when she said it was probably irritable bowel syndrome i was hugely relieved – it was exactly what i wanted to hear			0
the second time they told me i could be going through the menopause			0
’ twice put off , she delayed going again until she was ‘ doubled - up in pain ’ – when a locum @entity148 went through a tick - box form and referred her for a colonoscopy which identified cancer			1
but during the year - long delay the tumour had spread			0
ms @entity129 , now 48 and in remission , said : ‘ doctors need to stop being complacent about cancer			2
rating gps is a massively good idea because so many cancer cases are curable if caught early			0
these are not statistics : they are people ’s lives			0
an early diagnosis can be the difference between life and death			0
the number of times i ’ve heard stories of misdiagnosis is frightening			0
’ she thinks rating @entity36 would force them to be more methodical and make them ‘ open up the discussion on cancer , rather than expecting the patient to raise the possibility ’			1
@entity194 , head of policy at the charity @entity197 , said : ‘ anything that encourages @entity36 to rule out cancer first , rather than last , is a good thing			0
’ @entity201 , founder of @entity202 , thought ‘ naming and shaming ’ gps would ‘ pull up ’ poor performers			2
she said : ‘ we know that 40 per cent of patients with pancreatic cancer have to visit their gp four times or more before being referred			1
a tenth have to see them ten times or more			0
’ dr @entity213 , who speaks on cancer issues for the @entity215 , feared doctors might be wrongly labelled as failing on cancer if the rating system was implemented			2
he said : ‘ we know that we can always improve , but using crude ranking systems to measure our performance and ability to care for our patients , may not tell the whole story			0
the data would be complex and should be approached with caution			0
’ he added : ‘ gps across the @entity81 are doing an excellent job of appropriately referring our patients that we suspect of having cancer ; 75 per cent of patients found to have cancer are referred after only one or two gp consultations			1
‘ family doctors are working harder than ever to try and provide the best care possible when funding for general practice is at an all - time low and we have a chronic shortage of doctors			0
we should be supporting gps , not criticising them			0

@entity5 vows to root out doctors who fail to send patients for tests
doctors found to be dismissing cancer symptoms will be identified on an @entity15 website
figures show one in ten cancer sufferers have to see @entity148 at least five times before being referred to hospital
every year 80,000 people are only diagnosed with cancer at @entity34 *due* to gps missing the signs
*restricting* *temporary* *migrants* ’ access to @entity15 numbers , described as a ‘ *passport* to free treatment ’ .
making it easier to strike off dangerous doctors .
helping @entity15 ‘ *whistleblowers* ’ make complaints without fearing for their jobs .
*keeping* town a&es open where possible .
