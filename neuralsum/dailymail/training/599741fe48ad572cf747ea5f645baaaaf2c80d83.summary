@entity1 came close to nuclear disaster when a blaze engulfed a sub carrying atomic weapons - despite official assurances that it was not armed , it was reported today			1
@entity1 officials said at the time that all nuclear weapons aboard the @entity11 nuclear submarine had been unloaded well before a fire engulfed the 550ft - long vessel and there had been no risk of a radiation leak			1
but the respected @entity18 weekly magazine quoted several sources in the @entity1 navy as saying that throughout the fire on december 29 the submarine was carrying 16 @entity24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , each armed with four nuclear warheads			1
the 1986 disaster in modern - day @entity39 is regarded as the world 's worst nuclear accident			2
neither the @entity43 nor the office of deputy prime minister @entity45 , who has responsibility for military matters , would immediately comment on the report			0
a spokesman for the navy could not be contacted			0
a @entity52 spokesman insisted there was never any danger of the fire spreading inside president @entity56 gave assurances that there was no radiation leak and that the vessel 's nuclear - tipped missiles were not on board the huge fire which engulfed the @entity11 nuclear submarine is the latest catastrophe to afflict @entity1 submarines in recent years			1
in november 2008 20 @entity1 choked to death on poisonous gas on board the @entity72 nuclear submarine			1
the men suffocated when faulty firefighting equipment went off by mistake while the new craft was carrying out underwater tests in the @entity78			0
in august 2003 , two member of a 10 - man crew on a @entity1 k - 159 sub died when the vessel sank in the @entity83			2
the submarine 's nuclear reactor was shut down at the time the vessel sank about three nautical miles north west of @entity87			2
but by far the worst @entity1 sub disaster in recent memory happened on the @entity90 ( pictured above ) in august 2000			2
an explosion during exercises sent the nuclear sub to the bottom of the @entity83 , killing all 118 men on board			2
@entity1 refused offers of help from @entity99 and the @entity100 and a @entity1 rescue attempt failed the fire started when welding sparks ignited wooden scaffolding around the 18,200 - tonne submarine at the @entity107 docks , 900 miles north of @entity108 and one of the main shipyards used by @entity1 's northern fleet			0
the rubber covering of the submarine then caught fire , sending flames and black smoke 30ft above the stricken vessel			0
@entity118 battled the blaze for a day and a night before partially sinking the submarine to douse the flames , according to media reports			0
@entity18 reported that immediately after the fire the @entity11 sailed to the navy 's weapons store , an unusual trip for a damaged submarine supposedly carrying no weapons and casting doubt on assurances that it was not armed			1
' @entity132 was in dock with rockets and torpedoes on board , ' the magazine said , adding that apart from the nuclear weapons the submarine was carrying torpedoes and mines as well as its two nuclear reactors			0
the magazine said that if one of the torpedoes had exploded it could have threatened the nuclear missiles , leading to an extremely dangerous nuclear accident			0
media reports of what happened at the time of the fire were contradictory and foreign journalists were unable to gain access to the high security zone			0
@entity1 's worst post-soviet submarine disaster was in august 2000 when the nuclear submarine @entity90 sank in the @entity83 killing all 118 crewmen aboard			1
