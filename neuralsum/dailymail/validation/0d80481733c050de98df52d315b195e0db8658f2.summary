the @entity1 vice president used the opportunity to tell staff how ' disappointed ' he was in the cabin crew member 's behaviour in a mass email sent to staff			1

she is not the same stewardess pictured in the photograph above @entity1 told @entity64 the email was sent to remind staff how they need to respect @entity57 customs			0
a spokesperson said : ' the email was sent to impress on our cabin crew that , to make their working environment as good as it can be , while still respecting the norms and values of the @entity57 society in which we work , everyone has a part to play			2
' in @entity82 , the consumption of alcohol is not permitted for nationals and , although drinking is permitted for foreigners , being seen to be drunk would be considered highly disrespectful â€“ it would have negative implications for both the individual and those associated with them			0
' @entity1 employs over 31,000 people , and has high standards of its workforce the spokesperson added : ' in this particular case , the individual concerned was found in a state of incapacity by the entrance of a @entity1 staff building			0
' the vast majority of our cabin crew would themselves be disappointed at the idea that one of their colleagues should get into this situation , since they share our pride in the reputation of our team , and they would also , as we are , be very concerned about the safety implications for someone in this position			0
' referring to mr @entity2 's comment in the email about ' changing the rules ' , the airline commented : ' for over a year we have been working on a review and revision of the employment conditions for our cabin crew members , leading to reforms in our practices that have been universally welcomed by our staff as we have rolled them out since december 2014			1
' this is something of which we are proud , but obviously we are making these changes in a culture which remains largely conservative			0
we think that the cabin crew community has an important part to play in showing that we have done the right thing in making these reforms , which is why we wanted to move quickly to highlight the kind of problems that could be caused by behaviour which offends local culture			0
the spokesperson continued : ' the matter is now under investigation , and we shall not be commenting further			1
