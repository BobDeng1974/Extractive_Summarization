maybe one day , when his dotage is upon him , @entity0 will reflect on this night as the moment it all changed for him as the manager of @entity5			1
in seeing off a decent but hardly dynamic @entity8 side , the @entity6 took the old wisdom that you ’d rather be lucky than good to the extreme			1
his side were far from good here , barely even mediocre			0
yet , crucially , they won			0
and with the door to the knock - out stages of the @entity19 now wide open , the man who succeeded @entity16 three months ago now has more than hope to cling to			2
@entity20 ( 3rd from right ) opens the scoring for the home side in the 73rd minute with a close - range header @entity25 ( left ) celebrates his strike with fellow goalscorer @entity20 after making it 2 - 0 the two teams line up before the start of the @entity19 clash between @entity5 and @entity31 at @entity32 on thursday @entity5 's @entity33 ( left ) battles with @entity34 in the first half of thursday 's clash in @entity37 @entity39 of @entity5 ( right ) and @entity40 of @entity31 challenge for the ball during the @entity43 match @entity5 : @entity44 , @entity39 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 67 ' ) , @entity25 , @entity33 ( @entity51 57 ' ) , @entity20 , @entity52 ( @entity53 77 ' )			1

goals : @entity20 73 ' , @entity61 ' booked : @entity62 @entity31 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 88 ' ) , @entity71 , @entity40 ( @entity72 78 ' ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 88 ' ) , @entity75			1
subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			0
goals : @entity71 81 ' booked : @entity82 , @entity66 referee : @entity84 @entity0 spoke before the game of the need to build momentum , to aim not just to win their next game and make it four wins in a row , but to claim 10 successive victories			1
statistically , they remain on course for such an achievement but frankly the whipping boys of @entity98 are bottom with no points - will long wonder why they did n’t puncture that hope			2
the central @entity101 found @entity5 in the most generous of moods here			1
it took @entity0 ’s side long enough to create anything of real substance but even when they did they were wasteful			0
at times @entity20 's finishing was so poor that he must have wished that a hole would open up in the centre circle into which he could crawl			1
yet to the @entity112 ’s credit , he did n’t stop trying			0
he was rewarded with his first goal in a @entity5 shirt which laid the foundation for the most unconvincing of victories			1
@entity25 had the @entity32 crowd rubbing their eyes in disbelief by claiming a second soon after but @entity31 at least made their hosts sweat for the win with a consolation through @entity71			1
@entity5 got over the line but the free - flowing football @entity0 speaks of must materialize soon			1
after three months of agonising over his team selection , the manager finally stumbled across a scenario that presented few dilemmas			0
fresh from a thumping of @entity133 on saturday , the @entity6 ’s only minor concern was who would fill the ineligible @entity136 ’s boots but @entity20 was always the front - runner for that task			1
@entity5 's @entity139 ( right ) gets away from @entity31 's @entity69 as the @entity141 side laboured in the first half the hosts ' captain @entity48 manages to evade the challenges of @entity145 's @entity64 ( left ) and @entity69 @entity20 rises highest to connect with a header from a few yards out that cannoned in off the crossbar the @entity112 forward slides on the @entity32 turf to celebrate his opening goal for @entity5 on thursday night on the kind of @entity37 night that would have ducks seeking shelter , the closure of the upper - tier was a constant reminder of how bland a serving the @entity19 is when the taste of the @entity159 is still lingering on the palate			1
what a difference an early goal would have made to the subdued atmosphere and what a chance @entity49 passed up to claim it just five minutes in			0
picked out superbly by @entity52 ’ deep corner , the midfielder was granted the freedom of @entity32 by the @entity8			1
but his header did n’t remotely concern @entity170 in the @entity31 goal			2
@entity68 was one of two @entity31 players who almost failed to make the trip due to visa problems yet there was no excusing the lateness of his arrival to challenge @entity39 deep in his own half , the result , a deserved caution for catching the @entity181 on the ankle			0
with just one win in their last eight games , @entity31 ’s policy of keeping 10 men behind the ball when possible was understandable			0
yet @entity5 ’s inability to make any headway from open play in the opening quarter of the game was stark			1
@entity25 slots home his side 's second goal of the game after @entity170 spilt @entity62 's cross and , having kept the @entity141 at arm ’s length for long enough , @entity198 ’s side began to jab			1
what @entity44 knew of @entity68 ’s venomous , dipping volley from 20 yards out , only he truly knows			0
the fact the ball thundered off the keeper ’s chest suggested his save was more down to a stroke of good fortune than anything else			0
there was no mystery about @entity44 ’s next involvement just seconds later			0
@entity31 skipper @entity75 stole half a yard on a static defence and looked certain to sweep the visitors ahead until the keeper ’s outstretched leg foiled him			1
at this stage in the game , @entity5 ’s defence was something of a misnomer			1
when @entity34 prodded a short pass between @entity224 and @entity45 , they were in different postcodes			0
its recipient , @entity40 , rightfully chastised himself for firing a gilt - edged chance weakly beyond the far post			0
when @entity39 ’s whipped cross almost forced @entity64 into a spectacular own - goal , @entity32 briefly threatened to find its voice again			2
yet @entity49 ’s kamikaze pass across his own box to @entity71 seconds later drew more groans			2
on 38 minutes , @entity20 failed to connect cleanly with @entity39 ’s cross leaving @entity63 again unworked from a header			1
however , the @entity112 did tee up @entity52 with the last action of the first half only for the @entity241 to be thwarted by a timely block by @entity64			2
that late flurry did nothing to shelter @entity0 ’s men from a chorus of jeers as they traipsed back up the tunnel to reflect on a display described by @entity32 icon @entity250 as ‘ pathetic ’			0
the @entity6 midfielder @entity25 salutes the crowd after his strike that ultimately proved to be the matchwinner after the break , @entity49 was again at fault with a wayward pass from deep that resulted in @entity40 catching sight of the whites of @entity44 ’s eyes			2
only @entity47 ’s late intervention stopped a certain goal			0
then , twice in quick succession @entity20 latched onto excellent crosses from @entity39 and @entity47 no more than six yards out			2
both opportunities were missed with the only debate surrounding which one was the more glaring			0
@entity62 was sprung from the bench to replace @entity33 just before the hour mark and rippled the side - netting with an ambitious @entity273 soon joined him with @entity49 unsurprisingly making way			0
@entity31 understandably began to fancy their chances			0
@entity44 remained rooted to the spot when @entity277 sent a long throw into the box and @entity66 headed just over			0
yet , just as the notion crossed the mind that a solitary point might not be a disaster for @entity0 , his side seized all three in a remarkable five - minute burst			2
@entity50 won the crucial free - kick on the left flank on 73 minutes that also cost @entity66 a booking			0
@entity52 ’ pin - point delivery arrowed towards @entity20 and the @entity112 felt the weight of the world rise from his shoulders as his towering header beat @entity63			1
having laboured all night , @entity5 were pinching themselves just five minutes later with the arrival of the second			2
the hitherto solid @entity63 spilled @entity62 ’s routine cross straight into the path of @entity25 and the @entity6 gleefully rattled the loose ball high into the net from 12 yards			1
@entity0 ’s was only allowed two moments of relative calm , though			0
@entity71 appeared to use his arm to finish off a scrappy move but the arrears were halved nonetheless and it was a nervous last 10 minutes for his side			2
neither @entity53 , @entity5 ’s final substitute , nor @entity20 could put the home fans out of their misery as they squandered late chances but they hung on			1
@entity31 striker @entity71 ( centre ) pulls a goal back for the visitors in the 81st minute but @entity5 held on for the win			1

@entity20 gave @entity5 the lead in the 73rd minute with a close - range header from @entity52 ' cross
@entity25 *doubled* the @entity322 ' advantage when he lashed home in the 79th minute
@entity71 *responded* for the @entity8 visitors in the 81st minute to halve the *deficit*
@entity5 held on for the win and stay at the top of @entity43 ahead of @entity330
