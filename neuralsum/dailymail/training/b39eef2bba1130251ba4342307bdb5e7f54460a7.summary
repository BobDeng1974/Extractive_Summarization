by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 26 march 2013 doctors are to be allowed to strike up relationships with their former patients			1
new guidelines from the @entity5 say they can pursue such a romance as long as they use their ‘ professional judgment ’ to decide if it is appropriate			1
until now , the watchdog has banned doctors from having relationships with any patients , even those they have not treated for some time			1
the @entity5 's new guidelines allow doctors to start relationships with former patients a number of senior doctors had warned that such partnerships were ‘ flawed ’ and risked under - mining the public ’s trust in the profession			1
the guidance , issued yesterday , tells doctors they can not initiate ‘ sexual ’ or ‘ improper ’ relationships with current patients			1
but it tells them they can date former patients , as long as they give ‘ careful consideration ’ to certain factors			2
these include the number of consultations they ’d previously had with the patient and the length of time since their last appointment			0
it states : ‘ if you are considering whether to pursue a personal relationship with a former patient , you must use your professional judgment			0
‘ although it would not be possible to specify a length of time after which it is acceptable to pursue a relationship with a former patient , it is reasonable to expect that the more recently a professional relationship ended the less likely it is to be appropriate to begin a personal relationship with the patient			0
’ the updated guidelines are contained within the doctors ’ handbook , @entity56 , and will come into force next month			1
doctors should only start a relationship with a former patient if they have used their ' professional judgement ' to decide if it is appropriate and are still banned from ' improper ' relationships with current patients ( file picture ) patient groups welcomed the change saying it was about time the watchdog moved into the 21st century			1
@entity68 , of @entity69 , said : ‘ i do n’t see any problem with it if they are no longer their doctor			0
‘ i think it was all a bit of an old - fashioned idea quite honestly			2
they are getting into the 21st century and it ’s a good updating			1
’ some senior gps , however , have previously warned that such relationships are always ‘ flawed ’			0
dr @entity81 , a gp who practises in @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ‘ consider the powers of the doctor			0
this is the only profession of which a member can ask a person to take their clothes off and find the request usually met with few questions and no resistance			0
’ in a previous interview with @entity97 , he said : ‘ a proper emotional and sexual relationship is a partnership of equals , both parties enjoying the same rights , privileges and limitations			0
‘ any other basis for a relationship is flawed and needs to be criticised and resisted most vehemently			0
‘ it is vital proper boundaries are maintained in relationships between doctors and patients			1
’ but dr @entity112 , a senior gp who practises in @entity113 , said the watchdog ‘ should not limit the capacity of two consenting adults to explore a relationship ’			0
speaking to pulse at the time , dr @entity112 added : ‘ an absolute ban on sexual relationships with patients or former patients is an unfair limitation on the right to pursue happiness for doctors and patients alike			1
‘ we need new , authoritative public guidance which acknowledges the changes of the last 20 years , maintains the necessary safeguards for the vulnerable against exploitation or coercion , but gives a framework for those who wish to develop proper relationships			2
’ in 2011 , a poll of 282 @entity138 found that half wanted the rules to be changed allowing them to have relationships with former patients			2
some 2 per cent admitted they had begun relationships with patients they were still treating .			2

@entity5 has issued new guidelines to doctors
still banned from ' improper ' or ' sexual ' relationships with current patients
critics say new *advice* risks under - mining public ’s trust in profession
but patients ' group welcomes the move ' into the 21st century '
