the sight of @entity1 and @entity3 players embracing before kick - off in sunday ’s derby may make @entity7 wince , but ask @entity8 to explain his attitude and it is clear warm hellos do not translate to soft minds			1
@entity8 is one of five @entity13 likely to start at the @entity14 and having shared together a @entity15 that came agonisingly close to ultimate glory , he believes a few handshakes can be forgiven			1
‘ when we see each other in the tunnel before games , i think it ’s right to say “ hi ” and greet each other - whether it ’s an ex-team - mate or a good friend , ’ reasons @entity3 ’s record signing			1
‘ i think that ’s normal , as long as you remember that you fight for the club and the shirt once the 90 minutes start			0
we must all remember there are no friendships out on the pitch			1
’ @entity3 pair @entity8 ( left ) and @entity36 and @entity1 defender @entity37 ( right ) the @entity13 trio were taking part in an event ahead of the @entity42 derby on sunday an @entity8 insists he will embrace his fellow countrymen in the tunnel before the game but he ' has not friendships on the pitch ' @entity48 star @entity8 ( left ) , who has reinvigorated @entity3 , tries to beat @entity49 @entity50 are likely to feature in the @entity42 derby			1
it would be more if @entity52 was not injured			0
@entity48 ( 5 ) city : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity37 @entity3 : @entity8 , @entity36 @entity56 ( 3 ) city : @entity58 , @entity59 @entity3 : @entity60 @entity61 ( 1 ) @entity3 : @entity62 that last statement is one @entity7 and all fans in either corner of @entity42 can agree upon			1
‘ we know it ’s a very important match for the city of @entity42 , ’ adds @entity8			1
‘ we will be doing our absolute best to make sure the red half is happy at the end of the game			2
’ @entity8 , 26 , should be joined by @entity36 , with @entity37 , @entity54 and @entity55 in opposition			1
they all live in the leafy outskirts of @entity42 - @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 - but he has yet to go out for a meal with the men he reached the final in @entity56 beside			0
‘ sure if you do win there will be plenty of stick given out - and banter post match			0
but the real reason you want to give everything on the field in a game like this is so that your own fans go away happy			2
’ this is @entity8 ’s first derby for his new team but he knows the intensity and fierce pride taken when two sides of a city collide			1
@entity99 , his first club , share ferocious battles with @entity101 situated little more than four miles away			0
@entity8 played in two ; winning one , losing one			1
@entity8 puts a young @entity3 fan through his paces during the event in @entity42 and the forward watches as another attempts a few of her best flicks and tricks at the event @entity37 ( right ) will be a threat for @entity1 up and down the flank but must also deal with @entity8 ‘ @entity114 games can be a nightmare over there , ’ he smiles			1
‘ if you lost it would be a case of not being able to go out - not just for two or three days but two or three games			0
everyone would really suffer and did n’t want to show their faces to the fans			0
i know what it ’s like when you have to keep your head down			0
’ @entity8 ’s head should be up after a fine start to his @entity3 career following his £ 59.7million move from @entity132			1
he denies @entity1 made any direct attempts to get him			1
‘ there was never any contact anywhere else , ’ he says			0
‘ the people who came with all the paperwork ready , showing real eagerness to sign me , were @entity3			1
as soon as i heard of their interest , there was no question of me going anywhere else			0
i felt from the word go that i was going somewhere where i would be really loved			0
’ @entity8 is speaking before taking part in a kick - about with local kids as part of a joint initiative between the two clubs and the @entity151			2
@entity37 is here also , and will probably be the defender tasked with shackling his compatriot come sunday			1
‘ you need the perfect day to stop players like him , ’ says @entity37			2
‘ i will try to play as good as i can			2
he ’s quick and has a great technique			0
the @entity13 then showed off a few of his best moves as the lucky youngsters stood back and admired @entity56 midfielder @entity58 is likely to partner @entity160 in midfield for @entity1 ‘ we ’ve known each for many years			1
i was so happy when he signed for @entity3 because it was something good for him , he was really excited to come here and play in the @entity151			1
‘ he texted me when he was looking to move to @entity42 to ask about the city , so i can help with some information			2
’ he believes had @entity8 recovered from his thigh injury in time for the @entity15 final against @entity171 victory might have been found			2
‘ it would have made a big difference			0
they defended very solidly , very tight , and narrow			0
we needed quick players to play in counter-attack			0
@entity8 is one of those players who never stops running , never stops going forward , attacking the space			2
’ zabaleta joke she may need to open an @entity13 steakhouse to cater to the growing contingent but knows it is local pride as well as hard points at stake on sunday			1
‘ it is the best team we can have now at the moment , ’ he says			0
‘ it is a special game			0
it is the game everyone is looking at and waiting for			0
’ first - team players from both @entity42 clubs were on hand to take part in a @entity199 session between @entity1 in the @entity200 and the @entity201 .			2
