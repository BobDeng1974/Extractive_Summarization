while many parents turn to toys and lullabies to soothe their babies , the latest parenting trend forbids these crutches , instead encouraging us to treat children like adults			1
resources for @entity9 , also known as @entity10 and pronounced ' wry ' , was founded in 1978 by early childhood educator @entity11 , who advocated respect between a parent and child and said adults should allow their children to solve problems without interference			1
the parenting trend - which promises more competent and self - aware children in the long run - has already taken hold among celebrities including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , but some experts warn it could do more harm than good			1
@entity29 grown - ups : the latest trend in parenting is @entity32 , also known as @entity10 and pronounced ' wry ' , which advocates treating babies and children like adults @entity10 teaches that instead of artificial and constant distractions like toys and sports classes , babies need relaxation and natural stimulation to fully develop			1
@entity44 's new book , @entity45 , is the most recent incarnation of the @entity10 parenting guide based on @entity11 's teachings			1
according to an @entity51 description , the book explores ' babies ' natural abilities to develop at their own pace , without coaxing from helicoptering or hovering parents '			0
the list of typically baby - related things banned according to orthodox @entity10 followers is extensive , from baby bouncers , sippy cups and high chairs to rattles , pacifiers , baby talk and toys			1
' children do nâ€™t need toys , ' ms @entity44 writes in her book			0
' almost all of the toys at @entity10 can be found in somebody 's cupboard			2
' enthusiast : @entity24 ( pictured in november 2013 with daughter @entity74 ) is one of the many celebrity believers in @entity10 , which discourages the use of high chairs , toys , pacifiers and baby talk pacifiers are also looked down on since , as @entity11 once wrote , ' the pacifier is a plug			1
it does stop a child from crying , but the question is , does an infant have a right to cry ? ' instead of trying to soothe a baby with tickling , lullabies or rocking them to sleep , @entity10 dictates that parents should let them cry as long as they want			2
the idea is that babies and children know much more than we give them credit for , and they should therefore be treated with respect as fully - functioning humans			2
as such , it advocates that baby talk should be replaced with long , adult conversations - a concept that goes against a recent study by researchers at the @entity107 and the @entity108			2
good advice : @entity110 and wife @entity111 ( pictured with daughters in march 2013 ) are also proponents of the parenting method , which was originally developed in the 1940s by @entity11 understanding your kids : @entity25 ( pictured in june 2012 ) , who , with husband @entity117 , practices @entity10 , has said : ' children perceive everything			1
they are really smart ' according to the study 's co-author dr @entity121 , it found that ' the prevalence of baby talk in one - on - one conversations with children is linked to better language development , both concurrent and future			2
' ' the pacifier is a plug			0
it stops a child from crying , but does n't an infant have a right to cry ? ' indeed , the more parents exaggerated vowels - for example ' how are youuuuu ? ' - and raised the pitch of their voices , the more the one - year - olds babbled , which is a forerunner of word production			0
despite this conflicting theory , many proponents of @entity10 - including @entity25 - say its teachings are the key to successful parenting			1
the 39 - year - old actress , who has two children with her husband @entity117 , told the @entity152 in december that she is a devoted follower of the parenting technique			2
self - improvement : and according to @entity23 ( with daughter @entity155 in 2010 ) : ' @entity10 takes you back to basics			1
@entity10 makes us all better			0
better people ' ' children perceive everything , ' she said			0
' they are really smart			0
' and @entity23 , whose two adopted children are now 17 and 27 , told @entity166 : ' @entity10 takes you back to basics			1
@entity10 makes us all better			0
' how - to : @entity44 's book , @entity45 , published on december 17 , is the most recent @entity10 parenting guide nevertheless , problems can arise in that @entity10 does n't allow a parent to interfere with their child , even if he or she is in a fight			1
author @entity180 told @entity166 about a time that her child was attending an @entity10 snack time with other children , one of whom ' started shoving huge tables at the babies on the floor '			2
at first , the mothers , though panicked , simply sat back and watched since they were supposed to never interfere			0
' finally , i stood up and said , " are you f * * * * * * kidding me ? this is dangerous , " ' explained ms @entity180			0
' i picked my kid up and took him out of the circle , and all the other mothers followed			0
' still , it 's not just trend - concious celebrities who have sung @entity10 's praises ; all five reviews of ms @entity44 's book on @entity51 are gushing			1
' parenting is the hardest job there is , ' wrote one enthusiast			0
' and this book has the antidote to so many of the traps and dysfunctional patterns that families get stuck in because of lack of awareness			0
' another said the book is ' an interesting comment on how each of us can simplify and improve our relationships by assuming all individuals , as well as babies , are competent and can make good decisions			0
