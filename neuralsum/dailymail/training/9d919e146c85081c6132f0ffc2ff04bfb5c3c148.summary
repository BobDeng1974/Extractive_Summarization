however , in a face - saving move , the prince will fashion himself the role of a jobbing royal with a particular interest in @entity17 business			1
mixing with the stars : prince @entity1 meets @entity20 actor @entity19 and his wife @entity21 it means he will continue to clock up miles travelling abroad at taxpayers ' expense			1
@entity1 has been dogged by controversy since he gave himself the rather grand title of @entity17 @entity28 in october 2001			2
he has been repeatedly accused of ‘ cashing in ’ on connections with oil - rich trading partners , of developing questionable friendships with disreputable figures and of lavishing millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money on private jets and helicopters			2
in his annual review , published late last night , the prince put a brave face on his demotion , saying he had decided to ‘ evolve ’ his role to concentrate on promoting @entity17 skills and exports			1
he wrote : ‘ as the evolution of my role continues apace … i have decided that the label i gave myself when i began this role of @entity49 has served its purpose and is no longer necessary to the work that i do today and , more importantly , in the future			1
’ the @entity53 has been dogged by accusations of a lack of judgment about his links with billionaire @entity10 ( right ) , who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution while admitting he would be focusing on the @entity17 , he stressed his work would take him to the @entity64 and @entity65 but said that all overseas engagements would be rubber stamped by the @entity68 at the palace and the @entity70			1
the final nail in the coffin for @entity1 ’s envoy role was the revelation of his links with @entity10			1
in february photographs were published of the pair walking together in @entity78 , after the billionaire financier had been released from jail for grooming underage girls for sex			2
@entity1 has been the @entity17 's @entity28 since 2001			2

help or hindrance ? prince @entity1 is pictured here at a military air display event in @entity106 , @entity107 while they admit that @entity1 has been useful in opening doors , particularly in former @entity112 republics and the @entity64 , officials at @entity109 were not queuing up to heap praise on him yesterday			0
‘ he is a very difficult man to deal with – rather pompous and one who simply refuses to listen to reason , ’ said one official who asked to remain anonymous			0
‘ i think many people will be breathing a sigh of relief			0
’ but the suggestion that @entity1 will sever his formal link with @entity109 – which was first revealed by the @entity123 ’s @entity122 – will not curtail his activities			0
