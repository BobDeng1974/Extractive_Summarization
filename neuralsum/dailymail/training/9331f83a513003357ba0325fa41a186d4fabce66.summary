of all the unlikely success stories at this @entity2 , it would be hard to top that of emerging @entity5 star @entity4			1
five years ago , he was living with the parents of team - mate @entity8 to save money as he tried to get @entity11 club @entity10 to turn a six - month contract into something more permanent			1
not only is he still with @entity14 in 2014 and their star player , @entity4 has also gone on to become @entity17 's secret weapon at this @entity2			1
naturally , @entity17 is delighted with midfielder , recognisable for flowing dark locks and the @entity35 - like nickname “ @entity36 ” : ' he 's in the inner circle now , ' said the @entity39 manager			1
' he has stepped it up , gained confidence and that 's great to see			0
' @entity43 may also wonder why he did n't stand out when he trained with them in january 2013 , returning to @entity5 without a contract offer at @entity47			2
if we did n't know too much about him before the @entity2 , you can be sure @entity52 manager @entity51 has done his research on 26 - year - old @entity4 , and particularly his delivery at set - pieces , before tuesday night 's round of 16 tie in @entity58			1
@entity4 's story is typical of the new generation of @entity5 players taking the game to a new audience			2
making a name for himself : @entity4 has come a long way in the last few years part of the team : @entity4 has proved to be a key member of the @entity21 side along with more well known players like @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 up against the best : @entity4 tackles @entity75 during their group game no soccer player stateside is born with a silver spoon			1
starting salaries even at @entity11 level can be as low as $ 34,000 - a - year ( £ 20,000 ) and you have to show hunger and desire to make it			2
@entity4 was only ranked 23rd in the draft system used by @entity5 sport when he was signed by @entity14 in 2009			0
he could n't afford his own apartment in the city so slept on an airbed in someone else 's , and then moved in with @entity8 and his family			2
in a nice twist , @entity8 is also in @entity17 's @entity2 squad in @entity94			1
helping hand : @entity4 lived with @entity8 's parents when he was starting out and could not afford a place of his own in @entity11 , @entity4 proved to be a slow burner			1
2012 was his breakthrough year , top of the assist charts with 15 , and a 45 - yard free - kick proving a @entity104 sensation , that includes the amusing commentary : “ @entity106 has become the field of dreams for @entity4 ”			2
when a move to @entity110 did n't work out early in 2013 , @entity4 returned home and got a new four - year contract with @entity14			1
league star : @entity4 is one of the best players playing for @entity10 in @entity11 the early years : @entity4 in his early years for @entity10 in 2009 working his way up : @entity4 was playing for @entity116 at the @entity117 back in 2006 @entity17 took note			1
@entity4 became an important player in qualification and his goal against @entity122 also helped @entity123 qualify for the finals , making him a hero there too			0
in @entity94 , the @entity4 success story has really taken off			0
a late substitute in the first @entity5 game against @entity131 , it was his brilliant outswinging corner that set up @entity132 to head the winner , leaving the scorer in disbelief			0
@entity4 was put in the starting line - up with @entity137 injured , and he set up @entity73 's goal against @entity139 with another important cross			2
it proved the goal that ultimately took the @entity5 into the knockout stages			0
despite @entity52 's galaxy of stars , there is a growing sense of belief in the @entity5 team that they can reach the quarter - finals for only the second time			0
@entity4 and his colleagues are threatening to become as popular as @entity154 or @entity155 stars			0
having his old buddy @entity8 beside him has made it all the more special for the 26 - year - old , who has scored and made goals consistently for the past two seasons			0
' after all we 've been through together , ' he said			0
' i ca n't imagine sharing this experience with anyone else			0

@entity4 was *staying* with @entity8 's parents to save money five years ago
@entity4 earned an *initial* six - month contract with @entity11 side @entity10 and is now their star player
failed impress while on trial with @entity43 in 2013
has emerged as @entity17 's secret weapon for @entity175 in @entity2 2014
