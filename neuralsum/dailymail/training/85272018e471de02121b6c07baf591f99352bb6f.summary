a new life insurance policy is set to cover every eventuality ... including being exterminated by @entity2 , crushed by a transformer or killed in a ' @entity4 ' ! @entity5 will also pay out in the unfortunate event of being killed by @entity8 death rays or eaten by the @entity10 monsters			1
and in a nod to ghostbusters , being crushed by a giant man made of marshmallow is covered too in the bizarre list of acceptable causes of death by the insurer			1
@entity5 is offering its customers the opportunity to insure themselves against death by @entity2 but wacky as they are , there is a serious point , says the financial giant , as they hope it highlights just how little people take life insurance seriously in the first place			1
@entity5 say they will pay out if you are killed by a shark whipped from the sea by a tornado and then deposited in the middle of the city , like b - movie horror film @entity4			1
but they hope it will encourage people to realise that while this is unlikely to happen , real chances of accidental death are far more likely than many realise			2
the ten wacky ways to die are familiar to film and tv fans as they take their inspiration from scifi like dr who and @entity51 to @entity52 and even @entity53			0
however , @entity5 would like to point out that falling from the beanstalk itself is not covered because of the risks involved in taking on the task invalidates the policy ! @entity5 will pay out if a shark is taken from the sea by a tornado and kills you in the middle of the street @entity5 director @entity66 said : ' this is a light - hearted attempt to highlight the importance of life insurance			1
' what 's odd , though , is that our sense of risk is a bit skewed			0
' in life we spend too much time imagining the things that will never happen			0
' maybe we should spend a little bit more time thinking about and planning for what eventually will happen			0
' for example , around 30 million lottery tickets are sold in the @entity82 every saturday to hopeful people thinking that they might just win			0
' the odds are in fact higher that they could meet an unfortunate end on the way to buying a ticket than they are to win the jackpot			0
' a poll of 16,000 @entity82 adults recently found only 23 per cent have a life insurance policy , falling to just 15 per cent in @entity94 though rising to 31 per cent in @entity95			1
@entity66 added : ' essentially what this tells us is that if @entity99 got caught up in a row between @entity101 and @entity102 over his plans to destroy the universe and restore the @entity105 to dominance by unleashing the @entity107 at the centre of the @entity109 in @entity110 , fewer than two in ten adults would have appropriate cover			2
' but more seriously , while it can be a difficult thing to think about , having life insurance in place is an important part of financial planning			2

@entity5 is offering customers insurance cover against freak events
included in the policy is cover against death by @entity2 or @entity4
also those *afraid* of being killed by a giant marshmallow man can rest easy
