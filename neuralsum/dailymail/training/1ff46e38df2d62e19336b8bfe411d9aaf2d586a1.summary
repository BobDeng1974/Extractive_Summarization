well , it ’s a start but it was not exactly a performance to strike fear into the hearts of the leading contenders for this @entity6			2
for now @entity7 will be relieved to have finally got off the mark in this tournament here at the @entity10 and avoided the fierce opprobrium that defeat by @entity13 would have inevitably brought			2
yet deep down they will surely know that there will have to be a vast improvement on this 119 - run victory if they are to ensure they get out of their group let alone become credible challengers for their first 50 - over trophy			0
@entity24 salutes the crowd after his excellent century which gave @entity7 the platform to win @entity24 took the game to the @entity29 , playing aggressively while those around him floundered in @entity31 @entity7 will be relieved to have finally got off the mark at the @entity33 at the @entity10 @entity24 of @entity7 celebrates with his team - mates during the 119 - run win over @entity13 in @entity31 @entity24 receives the player of the match award for his performance against the @entity29 on the face of it a score of 303 for eight followed by a bowling display that restricted the @entity29 to 184 should represent a job fairly well done			1
it is just that , with the exception of an excellent all - round performance from @entity24 , too few @entity7 players could be satisfied with their contribution			1
specifically , @entity7 must look at how they let a score in excess of 350 slip out of their fingers when they were perfectly placed at 172 without loss from 30 overs to inflict carnage on their neighbours			0
@entity24 should be exempt from criticism			0
first he played with class and an improved shot selection to hit his second one - day international century and dominate @entity7 ’s largest opening partnership in any @entity6			1
then he again showed that he is a worthy first - choice spinner by taking two wickets , including the crucial one of @entity64 who had given the @entity66 minnows a glimmer of hope with his 71			0
other than that this was a display from @entity7 that betrayed the nerves and anxiety that are perhaps inevitable after the sheer scale of their defeats by two of the strongest teams in the tournament in @entity80 and @entity81			0
too many batsmen appeared to be playing with a fear of failure when they had the perfect platform and opposition accommodating enough to have put on a show worthy of the aggressive intent they have vowed to produce			0
instead a tone was set by @entity91 , who looked curiously out of touch after starting this tour in such vintage form that it appeared incredible he had been missing from the top of @entity7 ’s one - day order for so long			1
here @entity91 limped along to 54 from 85 balls and was only rescued by the fluency and style displayed at the other end by @entity24 , who passed 50 for the first time in 12 one - day internationals and went on to hit five sixes in his 128			1
for a while it seemed that @entity24 was destined to race past @entity108 ’s long - standing record @entity7 one - day score of 167 and had he done so then his team would surely have got close to 400 against a modest @entity13 attack			1
@entity64 led the fightback for @entity13 with an impressive 71 but they fell well short in the end @entity114 ( left ) celebrates taking a wicket in a much - improved bowling display against @entity13 @entity24 should be exempt from criticism after his impressive showing for @entity7 against @entity13 after starring with the bat @entity24 was also influential with the ball , finishing with two wickets for 47 @entity91 limped along to 54 from 85 balls and looked out of knick throughout on a good batting wicket @entity91 stumbles after being hit on the pads , and he never really got going , despite scoring a half - century but once @entity125 fell inertia gripped @entity7 , not least when they could manage just 22 for the loss of two wickets in their batting powerplay			1
@entity130 , in particular , will worry @entity7			0
he has done little to justify his last - minute inclusion at the expense of @entity133 ahead of this @entity6 and looked rusty in falling for his third score of 10 in three matches			1
at least captain @entity136 looked something like his old self as he hit 46 off 42 balls including two sixes of his own , only falling in a disappointing climax to the @entity7 innings along with @entity142 and @entity143			0
the memory of @entity145 chasing down 328 against @entity7 in the last @entity6 was fresh enough to provide some apprehension in the break but the fact is @entity13 did not have sufficient quality in their batting to threaten			1
@entity151 gets up high to pull the ball down but @entity13 's batting never really got on top of the chase @entity156 ( right ) celebrates removing @entity13 captain @entity157 to end a dangerous partnership @entity13 's @entity159 dives to stop the ball as @entity13 responded well to @entity7 's big opening stand @entity13 have never won a @entity6 game and for all their pre-match bombast aimed at turning up the heat on @entity7 it would be a surprise if they break their duck here , even against @entity168			1
at least @entity64 gave them respectability against an @entity7 attack who were relieved that they had no - one of the calibre of @entity174 or @entity175 to bowl at			0
not least @entity114 , who was retained by @entity7 ahead of @entity177 and @entity178 despite being demolished for 49 off two overs in @entity180 , and repaid @entity7 ’s faith with three wickets of his own			2
so @entity7 live to fight another day but will need to win their three remaining group games , starting with @entity184 back in @entity180 on sunday , to ensure their quarter - final place			2
for now at least they can sleep easily again			0
@entity24 celebrates scoring his century with team - mate @entity91 during the @entity33 match			2

@entity7 beat @entity13 by 119 runs to win @entity6 tie in @entity31
@entity24 hits 128 in score of 303 - 8 and takes two wickets for 47
@entity114 impressive with the ball but @entity7 's batting lacks fluency
@entity91 looked curiously out of touch in an *unconvincing* win for @entity7
