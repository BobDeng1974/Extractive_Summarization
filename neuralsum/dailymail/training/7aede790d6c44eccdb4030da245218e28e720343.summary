by @entity0 it was once the sport of choice for retired gentlemen across @entity5 ’s leafy villages			1
but 24 - year - old @entity6 hopes to transform the fusty image of lawn bowls this week when she steps out on to the green for the @entity10 in @entity11			1
the glamorous sportswoman is @entity13 ’s reigning champion after she became the surprise winner of the singles competition at the @entity16 , in @entity17			1
@entity6 , 24 , hopes to transform the fusty image of lawn bowls this week when she steps out on to the green for the @entity10 in @entity11			1
she is a law and criminology graduate who has worked as a waitress to support herself now , miss @entity6 says she hopes her presence on @entity13 this summer will inspire young women to take up a sport , which is traditionally played by people many decades older than herself			1
she will play in singles and pairs when the @entity10 begin on wednesday			1
the sales manager , of @entity28 , @entity29 , is a law and criminology graduate who has worked as a waitress to support herself , and trains in her spare time she said : ‘ a lot of people still think bowls is exclusively for old people			1
‘ i ’m working really hard to try to change that perception and speak to young kids in schools			1
‘ the problem is people do not want to try a sport where people take the mick out of them			1
peer pressure is a big thing			0
‘ it is not a sport which impresses your friends at the moment			2
unfortunately bowls is n’t as glamorous as other sports			2
’ to prove her point , she recalls a time when she appeared on @entity55 ’s @entity54 to promote bowls as an 11 - year - old child			1
‘ i got a bit of stick about that at school ’ , she said			2
miss @entity6 at an award ceremony after winning gold in the women 's lawn bowls singles during the @entity10 in @entity17 , 2010 ‘ even now , i sometimes feel i have to justify why i play bowls to people by saying i am successful at it and that i play competitively			1
’ her unlikely appearance for a bowls player , however , has its advantages , she says			2
‘ i joke that i should hustle older players by showing up at clubs and offering to play a quick game against someone for cash			2
‘ no one would suspect i was any good			2
maybe if i get short of money ... ’			0
miss @entity6 , who was taught to play when she was nine by her father , said she had never encountered any sexism in the sport and that , playing with older men , meant she largely encountered ‘ chivalry rather than chauvinism ’			1
she said : ‘ our club is right by the sea so , on a glorious summer ’s day , there is no better sport to play			1
‘ it is such a sociable hobby			2
i ca n’t think of any other sport where grandparents can take their grandchildren along and play together			0
’ the uniform of white tailored trousers , she says , is rather ‘ old - fashioned ’ and could do with an overhaul			2
but she admits with a smile that it was ‘ really exciting ’ when her @entity29 club introduced bright blue t - shirts			2
miss @entity6 , who was taught to play when she was nine by her father , said she had never encountered any sexism in the sport and that , playing with older men , meant she largely encountered ‘ chivalry rather than chauvinism ’ ‘ it ’s not exactly tie - dye tops , but we will get there eventually ’ , she says			1
‘ when i first started at county level , we would have to wear gloves , hats , tights , skirts and blouses – no trousers			2
‘ the rules were 20 years behind society			2
’ miss @entity6 is in a long - term relationship with @entity122 , 27 , a fellow bowls player and @entity10 competitor for @entity13 , after meeting at a tournament in @entity126 several years ago			1
but when they tried to play mixed pairs for a year they ‘ nearly strangled each other ’ so now keep their work and personal lives separate			0
both are now training in @entity11 in preparation for the games , which start on wednesday			0
however , while miss @entity6 says there is a lot of ‘ natural talent ’ in the team , she also believes they would have been better prepared if they had received more funding from @entity143			1
she believes the government was forced to cut back on funding for the @entity10 after spending vast sums of money on the @entity148			1
miss @entity6 , who must train in between her full - time job , because ‘ there is no money in the sport ’ , said : ‘ unfortunately the funding from @entity143 has been quite low this time around , as with other minority sports			1
‘ the @entity148 was heavily invested in , which is great and we did really well			0
i do n’t want to take anything away from the @entity157			0
‘ but the money has n’t been as free - flowing since then			0
‘ i think as a result quite a few smaller sports have not had as much funding as they did for @entity17			0
’ she said competitors from countries such as @entity164 , or the host city of @entity166 , would be ‘ better prepared ’ , having played in overseas tournaments over the winter			0
‘ in the last games , the funding was one of the reasons we did so well			0
we could travel around the world playing against world - class players			0
‘ i should have been playing all winter like i did before @entity17 and playing globally but , because we are so short of funding , we have n’t been able to do any international tournaments over the winter			0
’ she said it had been a ‘ tough time ’ for the squad , but that they were still hopeful of winning medals			0
‘ in the ideal world of course someone would be generous enough to sponsor us and allow me to train in the sport i love to do ’ , she said			0
but the ever - cheerful player heaped praise on the team of coaches and sports psychologists and said : ‘ i play because i love the sport , not for money			0
if anything else , it keeps me out of trouble			0
‘ a medal of any colour would be amazing			0
’ miss @entity6 was a surprise gold medallist when she beat @entity203 ’s world champion and world number one @entity205 to claim the title in @entity17 four years ago			1
growing up , she did ‘ every sport under the sun ’ , including athletics , football hockey and swimming , including at county level			0
but when her father introduced her to bowls when she was still at primary school she fell in love with it and , at the age of 15 , she was forced to pick her many hobbies			0
‘ it was hard to choose between swimming and bowls but , when i was told i was going to have to start swimming before school , it was all over			1
‘ @entity225 is my hobby , i really love it .			0

@entity6 is @entity13 ’s reigning champion
was surprise winner of singles competition at 2010 @entity10
she said : ‘ a lot of people still think bowls is exclusively for old people '
