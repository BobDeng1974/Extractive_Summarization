earlier this month @entity1 chief @entity0 said the first humans set to @entity3 in the 2030s should be brought back after they ’ve completed their mission on the red planet			1
but in a talk this week former @entity8 astronaut @entity7 disagreed - he says the first @entity3 explorers should be tasked with setting up a colony			1
for the cost of getting there , dr @entity7 says it makes more sense to actually stay on @entity3 and only bring people back when the colony is settled			1
he says for the cost of going to @entity3 they should not come back at first			2
instead they should set up a colony and people should only start returning when a colony of about 100 is settled dr @entity7 was speaking at @entity28 ’s @entity27 in @entity29 , @entity30 on wednesday			1
' it [ will ] cost the world - and the @entity33 - billions and billions of dollars to put these people there , and you 're going to bring them back ? ' dr @entity7 said , reports @entity38			1
@entity1 has made no secret of its desire to land humans on @entity3 in the 2030s			2
but according to former @entity45 astronaut @entity44 , we should be looking to go back to the moon before making the giant leap to the red planet			2
he says we do n't yet have the technology or capabilities to safely make the trip to the @entity3 and should instead aim to live on the moon for ' generations ' before			0
‘ the next logical destination ? it ’s obviously the moon as its just three days away , ' @entity44 told @entity55 this month			0
‘ if there ’s a mistake we can turn around and come back			0
‘ there ’s sort of a public appetite for going to @entity3 right now in a big hurry , but there ’s no tech to make it safe enough and affordable			0
' ‘ what are you going to do when you bring them back here that can possibly compare [ to ] the value that they would be if they stayed there and @entity3 was n't empty ? ‘ and then , they helped to work with the next group and it builds up a cadre of people			2
‘ when we 've got 100 - or whatever it is - then we start bringing people back			2
’ dr @entity7 ’s words will likely strike a chord with @entity1 , who have been keen to distance themselves from ventures that intend to send people to @entity3 on one - way trips			1
one such venture is @entity89 , an ambitious proposal to send a crew to @entity3 by 2025 with no prospect of bringing them back to @entity94			0
the mission would see crews and supplies steadily sent over many years , setting up a colony on the red planet and televising the event to raise money			2
it has been widely condemned by critics , however , with many pointing out the @entity105 company has none of the infrastructure required for such a mission , such as a suitable spacecraft or rockets			0
in addition , a recent study from @entity28 found that the @entity89 plan was not feasible , and the first crewmember would die in 68 days owing to a lack of supplies			0
@entity89 's mission to the red planet ( artist 's illustration shown ) has been widely panned by experts , with many saying the @entity105 company lacks the technology or skills to have any hope of landing people on @entity3			1
the company wants to send people to @entity3 in the next decade should the first mission to @entity3 be a one - way trip or a return journey ? @entity1 is firmly in the camp of making it a return journey , with the agency already testing the @entity135 spacecraft ( illustrated ) that will ultimately bring the first @entity3 explorers back into @entity94 's atmosphere once they have returned from their mission @entity141 ceo @entity140 , meanwhile , has often said that he personally wants to ‘ die on @entity3 - just not on impact			1
’ his quote has often been misconstrued , however - what he meant is that he wants to live out his days in a colony on @entity3			2
@entity1 , though , is adamant that its first mission to @entity3 will not be to set up a colony , but rather a scientific mission akin to the moon landings to land and return on the planet			1
‘ [ @entity140 ] wants to die there , ’ @entity1 chief @entity0 said in a talk in @entity152 earlier this month			0
‘ he does n’t talk about coming back			0
but he and i disagree on that			0
‘ if someone wants to come back , i want them to be able to come back			0
’ some of dr @entity7 ’s fellow panellists also disagreed with the prospect of a one - way trip to @entity3			1
‘ at the very least , i think that people need a fighting chance to return , ’ said former astronaut @entity161 , who flew on the @entity162 and also the first @entity33 - @entity164 joint spaceflight in 1975			1
the @entity167 is continuing with a discussion by @entity140 later today			0
@entity7 ( right ) is seen here with fellow @entity8 crewmembers @entity171 ( left ) and @entity172			0
dr @entity7 - who holds a phd in @entity174 and @entity175 - was the second man on the moon and , in recent years , has repeatedly stated his desire to see humans walk on @entity3			1

@entity7 says the first @entity3 crews should remain on the red planet
he says for the cost of going to @entity3 they should not come back at first
instead they should set up a colony and people should only start returning when a colony of about 100 is settled
dr @entity7 was talking at @entity28 ’s @entity27 in @entity29 , @entity30
however @entity1 has been keen to distance itself from one - way trip proposals
they want to send astronauts to @entity3 - and back - in the 2030s
and dr @entity7 's fellow panelists also said we should bring @entity3 crews home
' at the very least , i think that people need a fighting chance to return , ’ said former astronaut @entity161
