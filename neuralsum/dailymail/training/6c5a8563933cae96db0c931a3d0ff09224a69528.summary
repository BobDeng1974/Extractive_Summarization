just 20 minutes before re-entering @entity2 's atmosphere , these amazing images show the @entity4 space shuttle as it hurtles across the face of the sun. but they were n't taken by @entity8 , nor by a professional astronomer using multi-million pound equipment			2
instead , the photos , clearly showing the tiny silhouetted outline of the shuttle in front of the sun , were captured by an amateur photographer standing in his back garden			1
even more incredibly , @entity19 photographer @entity18 had only 0.9 seconds to get his shot - but still managed to capture the spacecraft four times as it travelled at 7.8km per second			1
quick draw : the four photos that make up this composite image of @entity4 hurtling across the face of the sun were taken in less than 0.9 seconds he attached a camera to a telescope trained on the sun - with a solar filter to help prevent its powerful rays destroying the equipment			1
mr @entity18 sat patiently waiting for over an hour , readying himself to capture the image in the @entity35 area of @entity36 on july 21			1
the 49 - year - old engineer said : ' what you see in the photos is the @entity4 space ship passing in front of the sun , therefore you see just a silhouette			1
' good transits last less than one second , and the best ones maybe less than half a second			2
' it is a kind of game or challenge and the pleasure and the adrenalin remain the same each time			2
' @entity19 photographer @entity18 managed to capture the spacecraft four times as it travelled at 7.8km per second this composite image was taken on july 15 and shows @entity4 docked at the @entity58 as it passes in front of the sun enthusiast @entity18 point his camera to the skies the amateur astronomer - originally from @entity63 - began taking solar transit pictures in 2006 , and has gone on to capture over a dozen since			1
he followed @entity4 ' mission closely , also snapping pictures of it as it docked at the @entity58 on july 15 - and then again as it departed on july 19			0
mr @entity18 added : ' the main difficulty is finding a good location to photograph the transit			1
you need a quiet , accessible place in the countryside , without trees , big roads and private properties			0
' but the most difficult part is the weather			0
in western @entity82 , especially northern countries , it changes often and is not reliable , even in summer			0
' without a clear day you can not that you get the picture			0
' the @entity19 uses a radio - synchronised watch to make sure he knows exactly what time - down to the second - the shuttle will pass across the sun. but despite his precision planning , he admitted he never knows if he has captured it until afterwards			2
he said : ' i never know in real time if the shooting has been successful , because during shooting i look at my watch , not through the camera			0
' so it is only when i browse the images on the camera screen that i can relax knowing i have captured it			0
' touch down : @entity4 lands at the @entity102 in @entity103 , bringing @entity8 's 30 - year shuttle programme to an end			0
