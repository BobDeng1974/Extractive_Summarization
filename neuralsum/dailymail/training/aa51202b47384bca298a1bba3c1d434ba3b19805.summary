the @entity51 's new research has found that around 356,000 @entity1 were infected with chlamydia in 2013 , but only 8000 are diagnosed every year it is crucial for misconceptions about the @entity60 to be clarified so more people have the confidence to get tested			1
‘ having chlamydia does n't mean you ’re having a lot of sex or sex with a lot of different partners , ' dr @entity8 emphasised			1

the prevalence of chlamydia amongst high school students has led health professionals to suggest the introduction of condom vending machines in high schools			1
‘ we do need to look at ways to increase condom accessibility , particularly amongst adolescents , ’ said dr @entity8			0
‘ studies have shown that condom use and awareness has increased compared to a decade ago , but to get a young person to use a condom every time they have sex – i think you ’ll never achieve that			2
’ the reasons why people are not tested are varied , but a lot of it has to do with embarrassment and a lack of education			0
