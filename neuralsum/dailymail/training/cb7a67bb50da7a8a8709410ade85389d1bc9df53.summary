by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 police are trying to dissect a bizarre mystery after a meat cleaver was found jammed into a block of flats nearly 13 floors up			1
baffled officers are being driven up the wall trying to work out how the huge knife got there , nearly 150ft above the ground , as it is not close to any windows			2
the cleaver was discovered by residents of the apartment block in @entity18 , @entity19 province , embedded in the outer wall between the 12th and 13th floors			1
knife block : @entity3 police can not figure out how the meat cleaver got jammed so high up the building slice of luck : the blade is not near any windows and did not harm anyone in the process of getting there threat : police believe that the act could have been done to send a message to someone in the block it has not harmed anyone , but has left residents scared about what it could mean			1
' it 's really creepy			0
no - one knows how it got there and now we 're all afraid to sit on or balconies or leave our windows open , ' said resident @entity50			1
' we just woke up one morning and it was there			0
' police hired a local steeplejack to abseil down the building to remove it from the wall			2
a police spokesman said : ' it appears no - one saw it happen so we 're appealing for anyone who knows anything about this to come forward			0
' we doubt that someone on a floor above innocently dropped the knife which went over their balcony or out of a kitchen window			0
given that it was hurled in the wall with some force that seems unlikely			0
' more likely is we could be dealing with someone who is deliberately trying to disturb their neighbours or deliver some kind of threat			0
' we are watching the block and the knife is being tested for fingerprints and other forensic evidence			1
