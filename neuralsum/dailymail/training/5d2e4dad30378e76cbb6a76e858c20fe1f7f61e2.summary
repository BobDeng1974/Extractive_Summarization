it must require nerves of steel to drive a £ 1.6million one - off porcelain supercar through @entity4 ’ notoriously congested streets , let alone parallel park it			1
the super-wealthy owner of this astonishing @entity8 - or @entity9 - must have breathed a sigh of relief when it arrived at the hotel unscathed			1

exclusive : the 253mph car , which is the worlds first car to ' wear the finest porcelain on its body ' , arrived at the @entity26 , and soon drew a crowd of onlookers high - octane : with a price tag of £ 1.6 , and with a porcelain body , it takes calm nerves to parallel park the @entity35 in @entity4 ' narrow streets and when rumours started circling it had popped up in @entity4 , the ' car - parazzi ' packed their tripods before heading for @entity41			1
fans from @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity44 and @entity45 quickly arrived at the @entity26 where they found the world 's first car to ‘ wear the finest porcelain on its body ’			2
@entity48 , 24 , drove down from @entity49 after hearing the rumours			2
he said : ‘ i heard the one - off @entity35 had been seen in @entity4 and i could n't miss the opportunity to head to @entity41 and see it with my own eyes			1
‘ fortunately it was parked out on the road and what an amazing car it truly is			2
’ one - off : the astonishing porcelain @entity35 was made last year but it has never been seen on the road in @entity20 until now drawing a crowd : fans from @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity44 and @entity45 quickly arrived at the @entity26 where they found the world 's first car to ' wear the finest porcelain on its body ' he was joined by a group who travelled from @entity67 , @entity45 while @entity68 , 18 , said there were ‘ at least ’ 15 photographers at the scene when he arrived			1
