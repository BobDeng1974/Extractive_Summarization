a @entity18 spokesperson told @entity19 that ' the outing will celebrate the brand 's key bag of the season - the @entity24 - a tote designed in both red and blue '			1
vip support : @entity28 attended the @entity30 opening ceremony last month in @entity31 expanding : the @entity31 store is the brand 's first standalone shop in @entity11 credit for the brand 's expansion can partly be attributed to the effect of @entity28 , their former creative director who has since become a global ambassador for the brand in her role as @entity13 's ' first lady '			1
the 40 - year - old stepped down from her job in 2010 when her husband became prime minister and she was pregnant with daughter , @entity49			1
bag of the season : their @entity14 event will celebrate the @entity24 tote but she has remained involved with the company as a creative consultant and last month cut the ribbon to officially open their stand - alone store in @entity31			1
while she was there , she told the @entity61 she 's delighted at how the brand has evolved over the years			1
she said : ' i joined ( @entity18 ) around 1996			0
i 've always been a fan of the brand so it was great to go in and ' have a fiddle '			2
i think it 's been great but it 's been an evolution rather than a revolution			2

mrs @entity28 said the company have worked hard to stay true to mr @entity70 's vision while also moving the collections forward with modern touches			2
she said : ' when i arrived , we honed the aesthetic			0
we did a lot with colour and certainly expanded the women 's products , relaunching handbags , as they 'd always been a strong part of [ founder ] @entity88 's original collection			0
i went very much back into the archives			0
' she added that under the guidance of chief executive @entity93 , ' everything we 've done is think about what 's relevant today , both in the aesthetics and practicality , and what 's going to be relevant tomorrow			0

bags of style : the wife of the pm carried a @entity18 bag as she attended their new @entity9 store opening in february so it 's likely she will also make a personal appearance at their @entity14 outing			1
