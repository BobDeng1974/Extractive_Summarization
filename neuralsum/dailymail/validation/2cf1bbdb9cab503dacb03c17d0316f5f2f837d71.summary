@entity0 has described his historic achievement of having the first three home in the @entity3 as his greatest ever training achievement			1
the dominant nine - time champion @entity6 trainer has become used to swatting aside the opposition in his homeland and bruising the home defence with his increasingly potent @entity11 raids			2
but the feat of the @entity14 - ridden 4 - 5 favourite @entity13 leading home stablemates @entity15 and dual champion @entity17 will take some surpassing even for a man who has won a @entity20			1
the nearest any other trainer has come to matching what this modern - day racing @entity23 achieved was @entity6 colleague @entity25 , who sent out @entity26 and @entity27 to be first and second in both the 1998 and 1999 @entity28			2
a jubilant @entity14 enters the winners enclosure on board the @entity32 winner @entity13 it is the most outstanding feat since @entity34 trained the first five in the 1983 @entity35			1
@entity0 said : ‘ a one - two - three is a dream			2
on paper it is my best training feat , certainly			2
to get three horses in that condition is good for anyone but then to get the luck in running is vital			0
’ and it is even more remarkable given what else @entity0 managed on the first day of the @entity11 with three other winners — @entity48 ( 2 - 1 favourite ) beating stablemate @entity50 in the @entity51 ’ @entity3 , @entity49 ( 4 - 6 ) in the @entity52 and @entity54 - ridden @entity53 ( 6 - 1 ) in the @entity55			1
punters jumping on the @entity0 bandwagon cost the bookmaking industry an estimated £ 10million as they linked them in accumulator bets			2
but it could have been worse			0
@entity14 - ridden @entity65 , 1 - 2 favourite and the horse @entity0 had regarded as his certainty of the day , was clear at the last in the @entity64 ’ @entity3 when taking a crashing fall			1
@entity14 celebrates on @entity13 after the seven - yeatr - old won the @entity67 @entity0 said : ‘ @entity65 got a horrible fall and she will have a sore neck and shoulder in the morning but she will be ok			1
it ’s rare to have four runners on a day like this , let alone four winners			0
i keep saying to myself , “ enjoy it while it lasts ”			0
‘ you could n’t write a script like that , but i just knew that all the horses were doing everything right			0
it was going scarily well and i thought coming here it was either going to be a great success or a blow - out			0
’ the latter does not happen very often for @entity0			2
the man who has now trained 37 @entity11 winners and has been top trainer at the meeting for three of the last four years might as well pop the trophy in his suitcase for the flight home			0
@entity13 was imperious as he led home a @entity0 - trained one - two - three at the @entity11 @entity48 , like @entity13 owned by former @entity95 banker @entity94 , had been decribed as one of the best @entity0 had brought to the @entity11			1
he jumped with efficiency to set the ball rolling with a four and a half length win in the @entity51			0
front - running @entity49 proved fears about his headstrong nature were unfounded with a performance of total control in the @entity104			0
and there was @entity13 , the horse who has developed from an ugly duckling into a fully - fledged hurdling swan unbeaten in nine races			1
after he had made the running before sprinting clear off the home turn , @entity0 revealed @entity14 had formulated the battle plan months ago , even though he had only confirmed he would ride the seven - year - old on saturday			1
@entity14 glides over the fence on his way to winning the @entity32 at @entity11 2015 @entity0 said : ‘ i did n’t think he would win that impressively			1
i was wondering like punters , the media and the bookmakers , could he take on the @entity124 horses and beat them because we picked races for him that did not have top @entity124 horses in			0
it paid off and he learned his trade			0
@entity14 rode him with huge confidence and he showed that he was the good horse @entity14 and everybody else thought he was			2
’ his next run is likely to be at the @entity136 and he is 6 - 4 to win next year ’s @entity137			0
but he still has somewhere to go to usurp dual champion @entity17 in @entity0 ’ affections			1
‘ he is a very good horse and probably over hurdles the second best i ’ve trained			0
@entity14 made his intentions clear as he took @entity13 to the head of the line before the tapes went up			1

@entity13 dictated the tempo and romped home the *4/5* winner
@entity15 came second in the race with @entity17 in third
@entity154 gave @entity14 and @entity0 a treble with just four races down
@entity0 described the 1 - 2 - 3 as his greatest ever training achievement
