by @entity0 four years of guilt : @entity2 , 36 , stabbed and battered his housemate @entity3 in 2009 a killer who got away with murder for four years until his guilty conscience forced him to confess to the killing was jailed for life today			1
@entity2 , 36 , had stabbed and battered his housemate @entity3 in 2009 before encasing his corpse in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete			1
he and an accomplice who planned the killing then kept their crime a secret after police treated the victim ’s disappearance as a routine missing persons inquiry and assumed he had returned to his native @entity20			1
but hotel worker @entity2 could not live with the ' strain ' of his guilt and in may last year suddenly travelled 200 miles from his new home in @entity24 , @entity25 , back to the town where he carried out the killing			1
he went to a phone box and called police saying : ' this is too much for my mind			1
' the next day he led officers to the house of horrors in @entity34 , @entity35 where the body of airline steward @entity3 , 36 , still lay			1
officers broke open the tomb inside a shed to find it contained a low brick wall used to hide the corpse with three separate layers of concrete placed over the body to bury it			2
a claw hammer and two knives were found next the body wrapped in a duvet and tarpaulin			2
it emerged @entity2 - also a @entity20 - had helped kill @entity3 during a row over money			1
he later claimed he was under the influence of his accomplice , who convinced him @entity3 was a @entity20 spy			2
today @entity2 was ordered to serve a minimum 14 years behind bars after being found guilty of murder at @entity57			1
his guilty plea to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was rejected by the prosecution			0
the killer told police he was convinced that mr @entity3 was ' a spy ' father of three @entity66 , 35 , from @entity67 in @entity24 , @entity25 , who planned the killing was found guilty at an earlier hearing and jailed for life with a minimum recommendation he serve 23 years			1
passing sentence the judge mr justice @entity73 told @entity2 : ' this was a wicked and cowardly attack but you already know that because it preyed heavily on your mind over the next four years			2
if you had been able to live with your conscience this would have been a crime which would have gone undetected			0
' @entity3 was a wholly innocent man and the fear and pain he must have suffered in his dying minutes is unimaginable			0
this was wickedness beyond comprehension			0
' but i also take into account the fact that it was your conscience , your inability to cope mentally with the horrors of this event which led to the discovery of this crime			0
' @entity2 and @entity66 , who masterminded the murder , then hid his body in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete in the garden of the house in @entity34 , @entity35 @entity101 was told mr @entity3 who worked as a flight attendant for @entity104 was originally from @entity105 in @entity20 but had moved to the @entity106 in 2007 due to his job			1
he initially lived in @entity108 with @entity2 and another man before all three moved to @entity34 where @entity66 lived with his wife and children			2
all struck up an arrangement where they would pay wages into the bank account of @entity66 who then managed their financial affairs			0
but trouble began after mr @entity3 planned to move to @entity119 meaning money would not be paid into @entity66 ’s account			1
in the days leading up to the murder @entity66 bought a number of items from builders merchants including concrete , bricks and limestone chippings			2
he also bought a set of three knives from a supermarket			0
the victim was later lured into a specially prepared ‘ kill room ’ where tarpaulin had been laid on the floor and the killers wore blue plastic overshoes on their feet			1
during the attack @entity3 was stabbed twice and hit with the claw end of the hammer eight times with massive force which had caused his skull to shatter			2
his body was dumped in the back of the shed and encased in the tomb			0
the victim was reported missing to police by a work colleague in may 2009 but enquiries at the time led officers and his family to believe he had left the country			2
@entity2 carried on living at the house until august 2012 when he and @entity66 moved to @entity25 - with a warning to the new tenants that were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property			1
he eventually went to police fearing @entity66 was about to ' eliminate ’ him			2
in a statement he initially said he killed the victim in self defence			0
he said he was ' very scared ' and added : ' i ’m confessing now because i felt it was too much for my mind and i want some peace			0
' at the trial @entity2 said he had been ' indoctrinated ' by @entity66 ’s story that mr @entity3 was a secret agent sent by ' the @entity175 ' to ensure his wife was deported to @entity20 where she had tax issues			1
@entity2 added : ' @entity3 was in his bedroom and @entity66 called him down ... @entity66 put the knife into his neck			1
i took the hammer and i struck him three times in the head			0
' i was manipulated by @entity66			0
i was like a puppet			0
' talking of his life in @entity25 he added : ' i was frightened for my life			0
my conscience said to me " you 've got to give yourself in now "			0
' today det insp @entity191 from @entity192 revealed forensic archeologists , entomologists , cement experts , pathologists , psychiatrists , translators and financial investigators had helped with the investigation			0
after the killers had left the property , the new tenants were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property			0
pictured is the sack in which the victim 's body was discovered he added : ' @entity66 was the dominant force and had a controlling influence			2
he was instrumental in the cover up of the murder and leading people , including his family , into believing @entity3 had simply moved away			0
' but the strain of their secret in the end proved too much for @entity2			0
' @entity223 , senior crown prosecutor with the @entity35 , said : ' @entity2 led us to the grisly tomb of @entity3 and is now facing the consequences of his role in this tragedy			1
' mr @entity3 , @entity66 and @entity2 were all friends yet @entity66 seemed to exert some strange influence over the others that we have never managed to get to the bottom of			1
' @entity3 and @entity2 had their wages paid into @entity66 ’s account and , in return , he seems to have managed their affairs			1
' we may never know the reason why @entity2 and @entity66 killed my @entity3 on that fateful day - the picture is too murky			1
' but it seems likely that money was at the heart of it			0
@entity66 bought knives in the days leading up to the killing and tarpaulin , bricks and cement ... we ’ve always maintained these were used in the killing and to then bury the body			2
' this murder was planned , brutally executed and extensively covered up			0
