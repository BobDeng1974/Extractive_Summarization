@entity1 coach @entity0 praised his team for reacting quickly to the embarrassing setback they suffered in their 1 - 1 @entity5 draw with @entity6			1
the @entity7 had looked shaky at the back for some time during a @entity10 clash with @entity6 and , in the 68th minute , goalkeeper @entity11 flapped wildly at a speculative effort from @entity13 to concede the opener			1
but @entity0 threw @entity15 into the mix from the bench and was soon rewarded for making the switch as the @entity20 striker forced a 1 - 1 draw in @entity22			1
howler : @entity1 no 1 @entity11 reacts after gifting @entity6 the lead on tuesday night in the driving seat : @entity6 's @entity13 celebrates as @entity11 holds his head in his hands his equaliser arrived from a goalmouth scramble - only six minutes after @entity11 's gaffe - and @entity31 tactician @entity0 was pleased his players had managed to stay focused on securing a positive result			1

you saw the goal they scored , it was not easy to react			0
' but the players were really good and most important for me was the reaction			0
we also twice had a chance to score a second goal			0
' i know @entity15 did well , he 's a fantastic player			0
he always offers us a way to score goals			0
' the @entity11 incident will have given @entity0 , the former @entity53 boss , unpleasant flashbacks of @entity56 's mistake against the @entity57 at the @entity58			1
@entity31 job : former @entity53 manager @entity0 was pleased with his team 's response despite watching victory and two valuable points slip away in the final minutes , @entity6 coach hong myung - bo was able to praise his team for tightening up at the back			1
the fall - out from last week 's final warm - up game , a friendly against @entity71 in @entity72 , sent @entity6 off to the @entity5 finals in a fog of depression as the @entity71 had plundered an easy 4 - 0 win			2
@entity62 told @entity77 after tuesday 's match : ' the heavy defeat against @entity71 was not important as it was just part of the process			2
@entity81 gained : @entity83 wheels away after equalising late on for @entity1 ' we focused our rhythm and organisation on this match			2
' i think it worked well			0
the condition of players and organisation of team was good			0
' @entity6 next face @entity95 in @entity97 on sunday , three hours after @entity1 kick off against @entity10 leaders @entity99 in @entity100 .			1
