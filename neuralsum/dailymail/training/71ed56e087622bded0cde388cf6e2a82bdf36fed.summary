by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 30 october 2013 no claims : an @entity3 civil servant has lost her appeal case for damages after she was injured by a light fitting while having sex in a motel room on a work trip an @entity3 civil servant has been denied government compensation after she was injured by a falling light fitting when having sex in a motel room while on a work trip			1
the woman in her 30s , who can not be named for legal reasons , was initially approved for compensation by federal government insurer @entity20			1
but after further investigation the claim was rejected			1
in a majority 4 - 2 decision , it ruled that the woman 's employer did not induce or encourage her to participate in the sex , so @entity20 was not liable to compensate her			1
the @entity23 's ruling is final and could have ramifications for other federal employees who claim compensation for unconventional work - related mishaps			1
the worker needed hospital treatment after the incident which took place in 2007			0
she and a man were having sex in her motel room when a glass light fixture above the bed fell onto her face , injuring her nose and mouth			1
she later suffered depression and was unable to continue working for the government			0
@entity20 initially approved her claim for workers ' compensation , but then rejected it			1
an administrative tribunal agreed that her injuries were not suffered in the course of her employment , saying the government had not induced or encouraged the woman 's sexual conduct			2
the tribunal also found the sex was ' not an ordinary incident of an overnight stay , ' such as showering , sleeping or eating			2
@entity62 judge @entity61 overturned that last year , rejecting the tribunal 's findings that the sex had to be condoned by the government if she were to qualify for compensation			2
' if the applicant had been injured while playing a game of cards in her motel room , she would be entitled to compensation even though it could not be said that her employer induced her to engage in such activity , ' @entity61 wrote then			0
@entity20 lost its appeal to the @entity78 last december , with the three judges finding that the government 's views on the woman having sex were irrelevant			1
but the @entity23 ruled that @entity20 was not liable to pay compensation			1
the judges did not say how much compensation had already been paid			0
@entity20 declined to comment on the amount , but said it was considering recovering it			0
' the relevant question is : did the employer induce or encourage the employee to engage in that activity ? ' a summary of the court ruling said			1
a majority of judges — justices @entity97 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 — answered ' no '			0
justices @entity102 and @entity104 dissented			0
the @entity23 's ruling , in @entity106 , pictured , is final and could have ramifications for other federal employees who claim compensation for unconventional work - related mishaps the crucial facts were that the overnight stay was within the two - day period of the work trip and her employer had encouraged the woman to stay in the motel in @entity118 , 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) south of her hometown of @entity120 , @entity104 said			1
' in the absence of any suggestion that she was engaged at the time of injury in misconduct , those facts were sufficient to conclude that the injury the respondent sustained during that interval , and when at that place , was sustained in the course of her employment , ' @entity104 said			0
employment minister @entity135 hailed the ruling as a victory for common sense			0
' instances such as this , where an employee seeks to stretch the boundaries of entitlements , are of great concern and the @entity23 's intervention is welcome , ' @entity135 said			2
@entity20 declined to say what effect the ruling would have on other compensation claims			2
the government insurer also declined to say whether other claims in comparable circumstances were pending			0
@entity154 law lecturer @entity153 said the ruling reduced the range of after - hours activities covered by workers ' compensation when an employee was away from home on business			2
' i do n't think you can say that this decision means that all activity in hotel rooms wo n't be covered , but it certainly narrows that range of what activity will be covered , ' @entity153 said			0
' in terms of the precise activities , it 's quite difficult to say because everything turns on the facts ' of an individual case , he said .			0
