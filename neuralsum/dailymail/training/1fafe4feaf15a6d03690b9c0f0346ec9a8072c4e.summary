by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 18 june 2013 senior members of the @entity3 government have warned @entity5 member states that @entity3 car makers could scale back or scrap production plans in their countries unless they support weakened carbon emissions rules , according to diplomatic sources			1
with @entity5 governments and lawmakers aiming to finalise the rules next week , which most of the 27 member states back , @entity3 has stepped up the pressure on them to water down limits on vehicle emissions to protect the country 's mighty car industry , particularly luxury makers such as @entity21 and @entity22			1
the sources added that some calls warning @entity5 member states of possible consequences have come from members of chancellor @entity29 's office			1
@entity3 automakers like @entity21 ( pictured here ) could scale back production plans in the @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 unless they support weakened carbon emissions rules one @entity5 diplomat said @entity38 had reminded @entity39 of @entity40 's 78 billion euro ( $ 100 billion ) euro zone bailout , which was heavily financed by @entity3 , in its bid to convince the country to drop its opposition to softer limits			1
' they have tried everything at the highest level to pressure member states , in particular countries in the bailout club , to support their proposals , " said the diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity			2
' @entity3 seems hell - bent on pressing its interests			0
even countries that are generally pro-german feel that they are going too far			0
' a @entity3 government source denied that @entity38 had put particular pressure on countries that have received @entity5 financial aid , and said its aim was to protect jobs in the @entity5 auto sector			1
most @entity5 governments are backing the current legislation on car emissions , putting the @entity3 at odds with other countries in @entity71 ' our strategy is to focus on @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity35 as the big car producing countries , and on the countries which have important supply industries , ' the source said			1
they should all be together in this fight			0
we should not drive jobs out of @entity71 at a moment of high unemployment			0
' @entity3 's position is backed by a handful of central @entity71 countries with domestic auto production , but @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity35 are opposed , @entity5 sources say			1
the proposal from the @entity90 , the @entity5 's executive , would set a goal of 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre ( g / km ) as an average for all new vehicles sold in @entity71 from 2020			2
each manufacturer is assigned an individual target to take account of the nature of their fleet and their record of past cuts			0
but making less - polluting cars is costly and restricts profit margins , which is why major @entity3 manufacturers want to delay the stricter rules			2
@entity3 wants the emissions targets reduced to protect luxury makers such as @entity21 and @entity22 the legal changes demanded by @entity38 would allow luxury makers to continue selling more powerful - and profitable - models in @entity71 after 2020 , when the new @entity5 emission limits will take effect			1
under the plan , car makers would be allowed to carry over credits to pollute that were accrued before the new rules kick in			0
known as supercredits , these permits are earned if manufacturers make some very low emissions vehicles , such as electric cars , which @entity3 firms are making to meet a separate national target			0
the problem is that if they manage to hold on to a glut of supercredits , they can carry on making higher emissions models , and emissions levels will fail to meet the 2020 95 g / km target			0
@entity3 and its carmakers say the flexibility they want is essential for spurring innovation , but critics say the changes amount to major loopholes in the rules			2
an @entity5 source said the @entity3 proposal would delay achievement of the 95 g / km target until 2023 for those carmakers who made use of the accrued credits			1
the @entity150 has agreed fuel efficiency standards , though they lag @entity71 , while @entity152 , where smog has stirred social unrest , is increasingly aware of the implications of vehicle emissions for air pollution			0
in 2008 , after dire predictions of factory closures and mass job losses , the @entity5 agreed a limit of 130 g / km to be phased in between 2012 and 2015 .			0
