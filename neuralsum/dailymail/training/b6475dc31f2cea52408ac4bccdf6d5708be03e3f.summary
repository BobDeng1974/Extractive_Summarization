by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 13:28 est , 10 july 2013 a @entity2 - based designer has created a throwable device fitted with three panoramic cameras			1
as the @entity7 , as it 's known , is thrown from one person to another , the built - in cameras take multiple airborne photos over the full course of the trajectory			1
it uses orientation sensors to know when to take the images before stitching the multiple pictures together to create a single panoramic aerial shot			1
it 's a throwable camera that can take multiple photos as it is thrown from one person to another			0
it then uses image stitching to create a single panoramic aerial shot @entity7 is the size of a tennis ball and is fitted with three cameras , an orientation sensor , a microcontroller , image processor and image stabiliser			1
it can take multiple photos of a subject , left , before stitching these images into a single aerial shot , right soldiers on the battlefield could soon benefit from new state - of - the - art surveillance equipment that can remotely pinpoint snipers , ambushes and explosive devices			1
a throwable wheeled robot and a remote - controlled helicopter were both unveiled at a demonstration at the @entity46 at @entity47 , near @entity48			0
the 500g robot , which is equipped with cameras and other sensors , is made from titanium and can be thrown by soldiers into buildings to see enemy activity			1
the throwable camera was designed by inventor @entity55 from @entity56 and a patent for the device was granted this week			0
@entity7 is the size of a tennis ball and is fitted with three cameras , an inertial measurement unit ( @entity63 ) - or orientation sensor - a microcontroller and image processor			1
@entity55 ’s patent describes the ball - shaped camera as having position sensors that can detemine whether the camera is spiraling or spinning as well as the location of the subject			2
@entity74 also mean that the images taken do n't appear blurred or out of focus			0
@entity7 is also capable of registering the individual frames captured in a sequence			2
the camera can then use all of these features to create a seamless panoramic aerial photo			2
these images are sent wirelessly to the user ’s phone , tablet or desktop			0
designer @entity55 and his company serveball claim @entity7 can be used by search - and - rescue teams to take panoramic photos of the inside of dangerous buildings			1
it could also be used with thermal imaging cameras to find bodies , for example @entity7 's built - in cameras , sensors and stabilisers can track individual frames to create seamless panoramic aerial photos @entity7 can also take video clips			1
' @entity103 camera innovations are accelerating with advancements in sensor and imaging microelectronics , ' said @entity55			0
' and with the advent of low - cost , high - speed cameras for outdoor recreation , an affordable throwable camera is finally within reach			0
' @entity113 has created a protoype of @entity7 and , now that the patent has been granted , he plans to manufacture the device for commercial and industrial use			2
he claims @entity7 can be used for sport , architecture , search - and - rescue operations , landscape photography and more			0
the ball can be thrown into dangerous or unstable buildings , for example , to take 360 - degree photos of the inside			0
@entity7 can also be used with thermal imaging cameras to help emergency services find bodies in buildings			2
@entity113 is developing a second @entity7 model that can capture slow - motion , full - spherical video of subjects visible from a bird ’s - eye view along the trajectory .			0

@entity7 is the size of a tennis ball fitted with three panoramic cameras
the cameras takes images as the ball is thrown
orientation sensors and image stitching then creates the aerial shot
