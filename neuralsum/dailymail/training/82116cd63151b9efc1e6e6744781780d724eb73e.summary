by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100m squad now ... as part of the build - up to the start of @entity10 's @entity9 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity13 with the potential to light up @entity16 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity18 gomis in a nutshell it is extremely rare for a club to get a proven goalscorer on a free transfer , but that is exactly what @entity25 have achieved with the signing of @entity28 on a four - year deal			1
the striker 's contract had expired at @entity33 side @entity32 and , despite being a long - term target of @entity35 , @entity25 took advantage of the uncertainty over his situation and brought him to @entity39			1
with 12 @entity42 caps and three international goals , @entity28 ' talents have been utilised on the big stage and he is a big , bulky forward who also has pace			2
the 29 - year - old can hold the ball up , although his touch is not necessarily his strong point , and he knows where the goal is			1
@entity28 is perfect at leading the line and is a danger particularly in the air , but also on the deck			2
bargain : @entity25 striker @entity28 will cost you just £ 6.9million in @entity10 's @entity9 power : @entity28 is a big centre forward who can hold the ball up well , but he is also pacey in attack last season @entity28 scored 14 goals in 33 @entity33 appearances for @entity32			1
that is a strike - rate of a goal every 2.35 games , which is a decent ratio for the @entity42 league			1
with only three yellow cards last season , his disciplinary record is also decent for a big forward			0
the striker averages 2.4 shots per game and he wins 1.7 aerial duels a match			0
why you should have @entity80 in your @entity81 @entity28 is never going to set the world alight and he is unlikely to be right at the top of the goalscoring charts with season - but he is a bargain at £ 6.9million in @entity10 's @entity9 game because he will accrue points			1
with 14 goals in the league for @entity32 last season he has proven he can find the net			1
goals are like gold - dust in @entity9 and so @entity28 will guarantee you points			1
as a second or third striker option he is ideal because he will regularly gather points for your side			0
his disciplinary record is also decent enough , with just three bookings last season , meaning he is unlikely to regularly lose you points due to him being red - carded or cautioned			2
@entity28 could end up forming a formidable partnership with fellow @entity103 hitman @entity102 up top , meaning he should keep gathering points along the way all season			2
@entity109 quality : @entity28 has scored regularly in @entity33 and the @entity110 for @entity32 prolific : @entity28 scored 14 goals in 33 @entity33 games for @entity32 last season - a strike every 2.35 games the game in @entity80 proved his worth @entity28 has taken to life at the @entity118 like a @entity119 to water , with two goals in his pre-season campaign			1
his first strike came against @entity123 and it was a trademark @entity28 goal			2
full - back @entity125 lofted in a excellent ball and @entity28 rose well to power a header home from close range , the @entity42 international also netted away to @entity132 with a goal that showed both his pace and class in front of goal			1
he launched a run in behind the @entity132 defence and capitalised on a poor back pass			0
after racing towards goal with the ball , he put @entity25 2 - 0 up with a delicate chip over the advancing goalkeeper			2
he has already started to adapt to life in @entity16 football , and more goals are sure to follow			0
delicate : @entity28 has scored twice in pre-season , including showing his subtler side with a chip vs @entity132 competitive : @entity28 is tall and good in the air - he scored a bullet header against @entity123 during pre-season do n't just take our word for it @entity25 manager @entity158 seems delighted to have recruited the former @entity160 man			1
he believes the forward 's experience at the top level will make him a success in the @entity13			0
' it 's a fantastic signing ; a very big and important signing for the club , ' said @entity158			0
' i 'm very happy , ' he said , ' you are talking about a quality striker who has played international , @entity110 and top flight football in @entity42 for a big club			0
' it shows just how far we have come that we can attract a player of his quality			0
' he 's a player that can excite the crowd , make and score goals			0
he 's always done that wherever he 's been - and that 's what we want him to keep doing here			0
' we want him to be an important cog in the squad and help us to continue building			0
' aggressive : @entity28 ( in blue ) competes for the ball in the air during a @entity33 match for @entity32 against @entity189 @entity191 's cheap for a @entity192 at £ 6.9m in @entity10 's @entity9 game , @entity28 is extremely cheap for someone proven to score goals at the top level			1
incredibly , he is the 57th most expensive striker , yet his stats should be that of a top - 20 player			0
he will not top the charts but he will give great returns as a second or third striker			0
you want to budget well and @entity28 is a bargain who can accompany some of your more expensive forwards			2
here are just some of the strikers who @entity28 is cheaper than : @entity210 ( @entity211 ) - £ 8.3m @entity212 ( @entity213 ) - £ 8.1m @entity214 ( @entity215 ) - £ 7.8m @entity216 ( @entity217 ) - £ 7.6m @entity218 ( @entity35 ) - £ 7.5m cheap : there are 56 strikers who will cost you more than @entity28 yet he is almost sure to get your points			1
