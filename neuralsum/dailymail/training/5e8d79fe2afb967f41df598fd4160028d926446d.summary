they could reveal the secrets of @entity2 - and explain just why tv shows and films become hits			1
a @entity7 professor has plotted a series of graphs revealing some of @entity2 's scripting tricks			1
they include leaving the phrase ' love you ' until the last possible moment			0
the analysis looked at key words and at what point in films and tv shows they were used love actually : keeping the use of the phrase ' love you ' until later in a script is key , researchers say			1
' what i 've done is cut every script there into ' twelfths ' of a movie or tv show ; the charts here show the course of an episode or movie from the first minute at the left to the last one at the right , ' explained @entity41 , an assistant professor of history at @entity43 on his blog			0
he found that almost all tv and film writers delays the use of ' i love you ' until late in the plot			2
' for example : the phrase ' love you ' ( as in , mostly , ' i love you ' ) is most frequent towards the end of movies or tv shows : characters in movies are almost three times more likely to profess their love in the last scene of a movie than in the first			2
' other words and phrases that are key include ' if you '			2
' it 's rare at the beginning of scripts , common in the middle , and then rare again towards the end , ' says @entity41			1
the phrase ' if you ' rarely appears early in a script - as it needs characters to build up to it @entity41 analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study , and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot			1
he believes this is because it reveals a particular type of dialogue , in which the protagonist has to give or seek advice about the consequences of their actions			0
' first scenes wo n't have the necessary exposition laid out for the hero to reach a crossroads ; and as the script wraps up in the third act , the importance of decisions fade out in favour of consequences			0
' @entity41 analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study , and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot			1
@entity41 analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study , and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot			2
for instance , he found over the course of a script , characters talk more about the truth and lying ; they more often narrate murders ; they use the language of apology and authenticity			0
( two out of the nine topics display ' sorry ' prominently			0
) ' they talk less , on the other hand , about ' business ' and ' companies , ' about their ' job ' and the ' office , ' and about times of day			0

professor plotted @entity2 's scripting tricks by analysing films
found key phrases always appeared at same time in scripts
' love you ' was usually at end , while ' if you ' was in middle of *plotlines*
