by @entity1 reporter published : 09:57 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 11:12 est , 11 september 2012 here 's an artist who 's completely dotty about her work - spending months at a time constructing portraits of celebrities using paper dots made by a hole punch			1
@entity8 painstakingly arranges hundreds of thousands of tiny coloured dots to make up the incredible portraits , which can sell for five figure sums			2
ms @entity8 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , punches holes in the paper before using tweezers and glue to stick them on in a precise order - making up a host of famous faces when viewed from afar			2
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 have all been given the dot treatment - and @entity27 admitted he had ordered a dot portrait of himself as a gift for a friend			1
movie star : @entity21 recreated in hundreds of thousands of dots by artist @entity8 meticulous detail : from a distance the famous portrait of boxing icon @entity22 is unmistakable dedicated @entity8 has even suffered repetitive strain injuries in her arm , hand and shoulder after spending hundreds of hours repetitively sticking dots to a canvas			1
@entity8 , who holds a @entity43 for the highest number of dots ever used in a picture , said : ' my goal is to create two experiences for the viewer			1
' the first is a close up experience of either thousands of tiny , mixed up coloured dots , which in detail intrigue in themselves , but may seem chaotic and to have no order to the viewer at this distance			2
' the second experience is the far away view , the viewers ’ eyes and brain mix the dots and colours together , revealing the relationships of the details and the image as a whole			2
' my choice of portraits comes from an interest in faces , in the biological form ; bone and muscle construction , sociological , expression and individuality			0
close up : @entity25 imagined through hundreds of thousands of hole punched paper spheres panning further out : the tiny pieces of paper create a realistic grainy effect in this portrait of @entity25 the finished piece : @entity8 's enormous portrait of @entity25 propped up against a wall ' i need complete peace and quiet to create my work , so i try to do most of my work at night , when there are fewer distractions			1
' i can be sitting for hours at a time arranging the pieces , which has caused me huge problems with my shoulder			0
' but the feeling i get as i see a piece develop , and when it is finally finished is enough to make sure i keep going through the pain			0
' it can take several days , working up to eight hours a day , to even punch all the holes i need to begin a piece			0
it ’s not the most exciting thing to do			0
' i mix the coloured dots into tones - although the portraits look black and white from a distance , i actually use hundreds of colours , which you can see when you look at a piece close up			0
' i work for up to 12 hours at a time , and i ’m a meticulous perfectionist - i wo n’t say a piece is finished until every last dot is in the perfect place			0
' pointillism : @entity8 recreated this portrait of guitar legend @entity23 using a technique inspired by post-impressionist painter @entity121 it 's clearer now : @entity23 looking wistful depicted through a sea of dots the artist : @entity8 pictured alongside her artwork of @entity127 @entity8 ’s artworks contain up to 600,000 little dots - with her biggest portrait so far measuring a staggering two metres high and three metres wide			1
she created her first dot art piece more than four years ago , while studying for an undergraduate degree in art. @entity8 took inspiration from @entity121 ’s famous painting a sunday afternoon on the @entity136 , which was famously created by @entity121 making tiny dots with paint on the canvas , rather than long brush strokes			1
after visiting the same spot in @entity142 where he painted the portrait , @entity8 decided to create a modern day version - using the tiny dots from a hole punch			1
it took almost five months for @entity8 to create the piece - which used up 587,000 dots			1
zoomed in : how the tiny spherical pieces of coloured paper used in @entity8 's portraits appear close up she added : ' my plan was to find the spot in @entity142 from where @entity121 painted this picture and paint whatever i found there at this time			1
what had changed ? what would @entity121 see if he were to paint this picture now , 125 years later ? ' i went to @entity142 and found the spot by matching pictures of the original with the current landscape , and recorded my findings as planned			0
' on return i found out the hole punch was invented the year he completed his painting in 1886 , and he painted in dots , i found that too juicy to ignore			0
' i had to work up to 17 hours a day to get it finished in time for my degree show , but it sparked a passion for this type of art which i ’m still continuing to explore			0
' @entity8 has been working on her first ' dot art ' collection for the past year which will be revealed with @entity185 supremos @entity183 in january at the @entity183 technology centre .			2

@entity8 's artworks are composed of up to 600,000 dots
the @entity43 holder *labours* on each one for months
@entity27 revealed he has *commissioned* a dot portrait of himself
