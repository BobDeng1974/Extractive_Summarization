the increasing fashion for young @entity2 women in @entity3 to wear the burka is one of most sinister developments of our times			1
supporters of this garment like to pretend that it is a welcome symbol of our society ’s multicultural diversity and philosophical tolerance			1
but such warped thinking is woefully misguided			1
in reality , the burka is an archaic tribal piece of cloth that is eagerly used by fundamentalist zealots to promote a toxic brand of extremist @entity26 theology			1
everyone in @entity3 , including @entity2 , should oppose the insidious spread of this vile piece of clothing , which imprisons women , threatens social harmony , fuels distrust , has grave health implications and is a potent security risk			1
that is why this week , with the @entity55 of @entity56 , i am launching a nationwide campaign to impose a ban on face masks in public spaces in @entity3			1
such a nationwide prohibition would deal with all types of covering , including balaclavas , but there would be no exemption for the burka / niqab on any spurious , politically correct grounds of religious conscience			1
one of the key purposes of this initiative is to persuade at least 100,000 people to sign a formal petition calling for the ban , thereby obliging @entity73 to debate the issue			1
despite growing concern from the @entity3 public , our pusillanimous politicians have refused to address the burgeoning prevalence of the burka in our midst , as they fear accusations of @entity83 from the militant fundamentalists and their pc allies			1
there is no religious requirement on @entity2 to don the burka , and no evidence in the @entity89 to support the wearing of the garment well , it is time to put the needs of @entity3 society before the manufactured grievances of the hardliners , whose aim is to replace our liberal democracy with a totalitarian theocracy , the burka serving as a weapon in this far - reaching cultural war			1
in rejecting the ideology of the zealots , mainstream muslims should be at the forefront of the campaign for a ban , not least because the burka so badly undermines the credibility and reputation of our faith			1
there have , of course , been previous petitions and calls to outlaw face masks in public , but all came from the political right and gained little traction			1
it is the first one led by @entity2 , speaking for the moderate majority whose voice has been unheeded up to now			1
we invite both @entity2 and our other fellow citizens to work together to rid @entity3 of this alien cultural monstrosity			1
a key part of the impetus for this move came from the decision of the @entity130 this month to uphold the ban instituted by the @entity133 government in 2010 on all face coverings in public			1
supported by lawyers from @entity137 , a 24 - year - old @entity133 woman of @entity140 origin took her well - funded case to the @entity130 , claiming that the ban was a violation of her — and note the sequence — religious , cultural and personal rights			1
on every level , this questionable appeal relied on distortions and untruths			1
thankfully her case was thrown out , but her arguments illustrate the chronic weakness of any suggestion that we must allow the burka to be worn in public			1
first , there is no religious requirement on @entity2 to don the burka ; second , the burka is not a feature of @entity140 culture , where 90 per cent of women do not wear it ; third , there is no unqualified human right to wear whatever we want in public			1
in every developed society , personal freedoms have to take account of wider social mores			1
the @entity133 ban has proved to be legally sound as well as sensible			1
i have long believed that the same measure should be introduced here in the @entity3 to prevent community separatism and social apartheid			2
and , like the @entity130 , i see no basis for the pretence that there is any religious sanction for the burka			2
the wearing of the face mask is a custom originating in ancient @entity185 and @entity186 , more than 1,000 years before the birth of @entity48			2
it was upheld by male aristocrats because of social snobbery rather than religion , since they did not want their womenfolk — wives , daughters , sisters or mothers — to be seen by the peasantry			2
according to dr @entity37 , everyone in @entity3 , including @entity2 , should oppose the insidious spread of the burka , which he says imprisons women , threatens social harmony , fuels distrust , has grave health implications and is a potent security risk nor is there any evidence in the @entity89 to support the wearing of the burka			1
indeed , the @entity209 stipulates that men ‘ should lower their gaze ’ when meeting women to avoid lecherous staring ( verse 24 , chapter 30 )			2
so logically , if women were fully covered up there would be no need for such an instruction			2
some @entity2 clergy claim that the burka is religiously necessary			2
they assert this because the @entity225 ’s wives allegedly hid their faces in public			2
these puritanical clerics do not base their theological misrepresentations on the @entity89 but on the subsidiary and suspect hadith ( a collection of books containing the reputed sayings of @entity225 , written 250 years after his death )			2
' it is forbidden for @entity2 women going on pilgrimages to @entity239 to cover their faces			2
so if such a @entity243 practice is banned in @entity48 ’s holiest site , why on earth would it be required on the streets of @entity3 ? ' in any case , this is a wilful misreading of scripture			2
in fact , verse 32 of chapter 33 in the @entity89 explicitly states that ‘ the @entity225 ’s wives are not like other women ’			0
so there is no reason to emulate them			0
just as revealingly , it is forbidden for @entity2 women going on pilgrimages to @entity239 to cover their faces			0
so if such a @entity243 practice is banned in @entity48 ’s holiest site , why on earth would it be required on the streets of @entity3 ? the truth is that there is no theological foundation for these separatist face masks , as most non-fundamentalists recognise			0
only recently , @entity265 , the leading institution of @entity2 theology in the @entity48 world , declared that the burka has no spiritual authenticity			0
theology apart , there are many other compelling arguments against the burka			0
it badly undermines social cohesion by inhibiting effective interaction between @entity2 and @entity276 in the public realm			0
there can be no meaningful exchange with people if you can not even see their faces			0
moreover , the burka is an affront to the concept of gender parity in the @entity3			0
if i tried to wear a ski - mask on a bus or at a bank , i would quickly be told to remove the item or leave , or be arrested			0
why should the same rules not apply to @entity2 women ? dr @entity37 's proposals for a nationwide prohibition would deal with all types of facial covering , including balaclavas the demand for equal rights has always been central to the feminist cause , and in this case feminists should be calling for men and women to be treated equally			1
either everyone has the right to mask their face or no one has			0
there are huge implications for security , after several cases of terrorists and criminals using the burka to evade detection — a particularly worrying development given the explicit , bloody threats of militant extremists			0
in our troubled world , there can be no absolute right to anonymity in public			0
' we can not continue to accept the creeping @entity327 of @entity48 in the @entity3 and consequent destruction of our cherished @entity3 freedoms			0
a stand must be made now ' another concern is the health risks , for full coverings mean a distinct lack of exposure to sunshine			0
one recent study of 203 burka - clad women in the @entity339 revealed that all but four were deficient in @entity340 if that can happen in a land of blazing heat , how much worse will be the problems in often damp , dark @entity3 ? our society is already seeing rises in rickets and other bone - related diseases for the first time since @entity350 supporters of the burka talk about freedom of choice — yet it is not women who are being given that freedom , but men who are imposing their will			0
that is not empowerment but imprisonment			0
the burka is just another weapon in the jihadist arsenal of misogyny , like forced marriage , female genital mutilation and sexist discrimination			0
it should have no part in @entity3 society , where women are supposed to be treated as equal citizens			0
by tolerating it , we are allowing a form of gender apartheid to grow in our midst			0
all of us , @entity2 and @entity276 alike , have a duty to challenge the religious hardliners who have cynically exploited @entity3 traditions of tolerance and individual liberty to pursue their own twisted sectarian agenda imported wholesale from the @entity386 @entity385			0
a start could be made by forcing our politicians to debate the issue by gathering sufficient signatures for our historic anti-burka petition			0
we can not continue to accept the creeping @entity327 of @entity48 in the @entity3 and consequent destruction of our cherished @entity3 freedoms			0
a stand must be made now .			0
