@entity1 star @entity0 has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video , highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness - focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘ too fat ’ to ‘ ugly ’ to ‘ pudgy ’			1
@entity0 's @entity1 channel , @entity13 , has over two million subscribers , so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the @entity19 resident ’s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin – and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans			1
but though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28 - year - old ’s self - esteem , the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video , the ' @entity33 , which examines just whether conforming to society 's standards is the key to happiness , while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her @entity1 videos			1
fighting back : in her new video , @entity44 instructor and @entity1 star @entity0 combats body - shamers who comment on her videos she 's only human : seemingly full of confidence , @entity0 said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her ' fat ' online in a post on her @entity13 blog , @entity0 said negative comments on her videos are nothing new , but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately			1
she added that the trash - talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion			0
' it ’s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are , how much weight you need to lose , how much weight you need to gain , ' she wrote			1
' what do people want ? ' @entity0 goes on to explain that , through her new video , fans can see what it 's like to face that kind of negativity , and watch as her own self - esteem gets ' stripped away ' , leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance			1
fit or fat : the slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her @entity1 channel has become especially nasty lately , and has even made her cry peanut gallery problems : in the new video , @entity0 picks at her body , honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon the video begins with @entity0 posting a selfie in gym clothes , taken just after a workout			1
she immediately starts to read the comments , and though they start off positive , soon people are telling her she should n't give fitness advice because she is fat			2
@entity0 goes on to strip down to her underwear , examining , pinching and prodding her body , using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing			1
and as the video goes on , she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her			0
so the @entity1 star gets to work , manipulating her body in a simulation of real - life @entity106			2
she thins her thighs , hips , and waist , makes her butt and chest bigger , and even changes the color of her eyes			0
finally , she posts another selfie of her ' improved ' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy , and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body - shaming will only leave you worse off			0
before and after : the fitness expert 's body goes under a major transformation ; @entity0 used a body double to achieve the final look moral message : even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller , @entity0 still does n't find happiness at the end of the video no photoshop here : the retouching in @entity0 's video was meant to prove a point - she does n't use @entity106 in the photos she posts online it seems that her ' take that ' attitude has left her detractors speechless			2
readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback			0
' thank you for standing up to this struggle for girls and women everywhere , ' wrote one fan			0
another chimed in : ' i absolutely applaud that you are your natural , beautiful self			0
i think you ’re a wonderful inspiration for young people			0
' @entity0 hopes viewers who relate to the video 's message will share it in an effort to battle body shaming and cyber bullying .			2
