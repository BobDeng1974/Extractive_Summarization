sat - navs may help motorists negotiate the trickiest of ring roads and even avoid speeding fines , but the urgent instruction of ‘ turn around when possible ’ is enough to panic the calmest of drivers			1
now , experts claim the instruction could mean more than a navigational nightmare – it could also put a driver and other road users at risk of a serious crash			0
a survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat - nav admit making impromptu illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following sat - nav instructions			1
a survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat - nav admit making illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following sat - nav instructions			1
a stock image of a sat - nav is shown the statistics , gathered by road safety charity @entity27 and insurance firm @entity29 , suggest that urgent u-turns are not the only danger			1
the study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat - nav			1
this number rose to 11 per cent of drivers aged under 24 , but dropped to below five per cent for motorists older than 35 year ’s old			0
if used correctly , sat - navs are a safer option than a driver looking away from the road to a paper map , but there is fresh evidence to suggest that relying on the gadget can make individuals drive faster , paying less attention to hazards on the road			1
a total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo , while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers			2
the study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat - nav			1
previous studies have found that people are more than four times likely to have a crash ( stock image ) if they are multitasking while driving a total of three per cent of people said they were distracted by their smartphone , while two per cent were preoccupied by food and drink			2
@entity27 has called on drivers to programme their sat - nav before they set off on a journey and not to fiddle with any gadget while driving			1
@entity73 , deputy chief executive , @entity27 , said : ‘ the sat - nav is there to help you keep focused on driving rather than worry about directions , but it 's not there to make all the decisions for you			1
‘ driving is an unpredictable activity , so you still need to look at signs , particularly those warning of hazards or speed limits , and watch for people and unexpected problems			0
‘ for many drivers there is an increasing array of technological temptations that can pose a deadly distraction ; it ’s essential to resist to ensure you and others arrive safely			0
’ research by @entity96 in @entity97 has shown that the vast majority of people are unable to multitask at the wheel without their driving being affected			0
a study of in - vehicle video footage estimated that 22 per cent of crashes could be caused , at least in part , by driver distraction			0
it also showed that drivers who perform a secondary task at the wheel are two to three times more likely to crash			0
other studies have found that more complex secondary tasks , like talking on a mobile phone or texting , increase crash risk even more			0
researchers at the @entity116 have shown that talking on a phone ( hands - free or hand - held ) makes drivers four times more likely to have a serious crash , and texting raises the odds further			2
a study by @entity96 in @entity97 found that while drivers may think they can multitask , 98 per cent are not able to divide their attention without a significant deterioration in driving performance			2
scientists at @entity130 found that using a sat - nav can increase driver speed and reduce observation , but research has also found that using a voice - based sat - nav is safer than using a visual display or paper map			1
listening to loud music has been found to slow drivers ’ reaction times , and encourages aggressive driving , according to researchers at the @entity142			2
@entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 , found that fiddling with a stereo while driving leads to slower reaction times and more errors such as accidentally lane drifting			0
devices such as cruise control , aimed at reducing the driver ’s workload , can also have the unintended side - effect of making drivers less attentive and more susceptible to fatigue , a study by the @entity151 concludes			0
a total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo , while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers ( stock image ) furthermore , drivers who text and talk on a phone while driving are two to three times more likely to crash than those who are concentrating on the road			1
the charity has called on the @entity172 government to regulate the use of built in entertainment and information systems in cars , which show social media updates and traffic warnings on the dashboard , for example			0
‘ if these devices are used for tasks such as emailing and social media updates while driving , they are potentially as distracting and dangerous as using a mobile phone , ’ it said , suggesting tougher penalties for distracted drivers , including much higher fines for those caught using phones			2
brake also wants to ban hands - free kits due to recent research highlighting they do not make driving with a phone much safer .			0

survey by road safety charity , @entity27 , found one in 14 drivers have *narrowly* avoided a crash because they were distracted by a sat - nav while driving
passengers , and playing with car stereos were found to be distractions
charity has called on drivers to programme their sat - nav before they set off on a journey and not to fiddle with any gadget while driving
