heavy rains can be drastic for rural farmers , damaging produce and in some cases even threatening their survival			0
but one west @entity6 farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on sunday			2
@entity12 , who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of @entity14 , readied a surfboard , skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go ' skurfing ' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing - on the freshly formed lake , reports @entity23			1
@entity12 took a surfboard , skiis and camera down to the freshly formed lake after heavy rains on sunday the farm had received 60mm of rain , causing the creek to overflow , a highly infrequent occurrence			1
' i 've only seen it flow twice before in my life , in 16 years , so i thought you ca n't miss an opportunity like that , so i grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler ' he said			2
mr @entity12 said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike , a role he was hoping some friends would fill			1
but he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit , and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive			2
' we were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy , ' he said			0
mr @entity12 said he has been skurfing for over a decade , swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up			1
' @entity57 is pretty close to here , you ca n't get to the surf very often in @entity14 , so i started skurfing behind the boat , ' he said			0
