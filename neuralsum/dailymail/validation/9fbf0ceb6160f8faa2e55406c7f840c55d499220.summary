web - savvy militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 could control as many as 90,000 @entity5 accounts worldwide , allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease			1
the terror group is able to ' exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it ' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers , terror experts have concluded			1
recommendations in the report by the @entity20 - based @entity19 report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of @entity26 accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric			1
power : @entity33 militants ( pictured ) are able to ' exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it ' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers , experts have concluded the report , by @entity19 academic @entity39 and technologist @entity40 , says : ' while we do not believe that any mainstream social media platform wishes to see its services used to further acts of horrific violence , we also suspect some would rather not be bothered with the challenge of crafting a broad and coherent response to the issue			1
' while we can sympathise with the challenges and dilemmas such a response would entail , it is clear that social media companies do feel an obligation to respond to some social standards and illegal uses of their services			2
' we are not aware of any major company that takes a hands - off approach to the use of its platform to promote child pornography or human trafficking - or , less dramatically , phishing , spam , fraud , and copyright violations			0
' extremism , while raising thornier issues , merits attention , especially when faced with a rising challenge of violent groups who manipulate platforms to reap the rewards of spreading images of their cruelty			0
' showboating : @entity33 terrorists use social media to boast of the organisation 's victories and territorial gains the study of @entity33 - linked accounts between september and december estimated there were between 46,000 and 70,000 is - supporting @entity5 accounts , with the researchers believing that the true figure was towards the lower end of this scale but setting an absolute maximum at 90,000			1
it argues that the problem also applies to other social networks and extremist groups such as far - right organisations			1
@entity19 ' analysis was based on ' robust ' data collected about 50,000 accounts , and partial information about a further 1.9 million			2
only a small number of the accounts were able to have their locations identified , as most had this function switched off			0
but of those that could be located , the vast majority were in the @entity111 and @entity112			0
other were found in the @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , but these numbers were in single figures , the report found			0
they noted that platforms including @entity125 and @entity126 have already introduced changes aimed at tackling extremist material			0
horror : the militants also use social media to share barbaric images of atrocities they commit , such as throwing men accused of being gay off the roof of high buildings @entity5 had started suspending accounts linked to @entity33 by the time the research was started , but the authors said this created a new risk , arguing : ' while suspensions appear to have created obstacles to supporters joining @entity33 's social network , they also isolate @entity33 supporters online			1
' this could increase the speed and intensity of radicalisation for those who do manage to enter the network , and hinder organic social pressures that could lead to deradicalisation			0
' further study is required to evaluate the unintended consequences of suspension campaigns and their attendant trade - offs			0
fundamentally , tampering with social networks is a form of social engineering , and acknowledging this fact raises many new , difficult questions			2
' social media companies and the @entity164 government must work together to devise appropriate responses to extremism on social media			1
' although discussions of this issue often frame government intervention as an infringement on free speech , in reality , social media companies currently regulate speech on their platforms without oversight or disclosures of how suspensions are applied			2
