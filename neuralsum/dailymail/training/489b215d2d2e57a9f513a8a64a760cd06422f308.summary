by @entity1 reporter published : 01:11 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 10 september 2012 a sister is testing the bounds of sibling sacrifice - she is a surrogate for her brother and sister - in - law by carrying their twin sons			1
@entity10 volunteered to give birth to children for her brother after his wife had to undergo an emergency hysterectomy			1
mrs @entity10 's sister - in - law @entity16 , who is married to mrs @entity10 's brother @entity17 , had to have her uterus removed immediately after giving birth to her son @entity20			1
modern family : @entity10 ( center left ) is the sister of @entity22 ( right ) and she told her sister - in - law @entity16 ( center right ) that she would serve as a surrogate			1
@entity26 's husband @entity25 ( left ) signed off as well growing : @entity16 ( right ) had an emergency hysterectomy while giving birth to her son @entity20 ( center right ) and afterwards @entity26 ( center left ) offered to serve as the couple 's surrogate when they wanted to have more children after @entity20 's delivery , doctors could not stem the bleeding and had to remove the womb			1
in the weeks immediately following the operation , @entity16 told @entity40 that she was increasingly saddened - though understanding that the life - saving move had to be done - that she would not be able to fulfil her dream of having three children naturally			1
when she voiced these complaints to her sister - in - law , who herself was a mother of two , @entity16 said that perhaps they would use a surrogate			1
' honestly , i was pissed ! ' @entity26 wrote on her blog that she used to chronicle the family 's unusual story			2
' what if the surrogate drank , or smoked , or threw herself down the stairs ! how do you trust someone like that with your baby ! no way , no way ! ' without a moment 's hesitation , she offered to serve as the surrogate for her brother and sister - in - law , and after several months of discussions between the @entity70 and @entity71 and her husband , all of the parties agreed and began the biological and legal processes associated with surrogacy			1
the @entity80 - based relatives used fertility center @entity81 to help them take @entity16 's conveniently frozen eggs and her husband 's sperm to create two embryos			1
supportive : @entity88 , who has two sons of her own including her youngest named @entity90 ( right ) , said that her family has all signed off controversial choice : even though @entity17 and @entity26 were both adopted , the @entity70 ( pictured ) did not feel comfortable doing so when they wanted to expand their family two rounds with two embryos apiece resulted in @entity26 eventually being impregnated with the twins			2
by documenting their journey explicitly on their blog and speaking to @entity40 , the group have tried to dispel common questions about the increasingly popular practice			0
given the fact that @entity26 and @entity17 are siblings , the question of incest comes up frequently but that is one that they are quick to shoot down			2
' this is in no way shape or form incest			0
@entity26 's eggs are dormant during inception , and not used in this process			0
the embryos are already embryos - the start of life - before even being put in @entity26			0
they are 100 % @entity17 and @entity16 's			1
@entity26 is truly just the carrier , the oven if you will , ' she wrote on the blog			0
' as an interesting side note , our situation is even more different since @entity17 and @entity26 were both adopted at birth , from different birth parents			2
they are not even blood related although it would not matter if they were			0
@entity26 would have done this for her biological brother as well			0
this is no different than a sister carrying for a sister			0
' another question that bothers @entity26 is why the couple went through the process of having another child if they already had a healthy baby boy , and on top of that , why not adopt ? ' our family is very pro adoption since @entity17 , @entity26 and another one of their siblings , @entity148 , are all adopted			2
the process for adoption is similar to surrogacy , long and hard and expensive , ' she wrote			0
' when my husband and i told everyone we wanted to have another baby , no one said , " you already have a child , you should be grateful for that			0
" we conceived naturally and no one batted an eye , our second son was welcome with open arms and no judgement			2
so why is this any different ? '			0
