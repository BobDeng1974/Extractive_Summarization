ominous : @entity23 as sergeant @entity24 in the 1973 film @entity5 which was partly filmed in the @entity3 village of @entity17 the village where @entity29 filmed the classic tale once had four churches and open - air communions have been held to mark important @entity7 occasions for centuries			1
the religious tension over the fate of the last - remaining church , built in 1823 , is all the more palpable because the followers are part of a breakaway group which split from the @entity20 in the the mid- 19th century known as the ' @entity41 '			1
they have been leasing the church for the last 20 years - but are now set be left homeless after @entity20 bosses decided it should be sold			2

' the community would also like to know what will happen to the graveyard as it is unclear whether it will be included in the sale			0
' he added that local people would try to raise funds to buy @entity17 if it goes on the market , but fears thy will be outbid by developers			2
