@entity0 has been named the ' most dismal town ' in @entity2 after winning an annual award that recognises the worst - looking place in the country			1
it beat out contenders including @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13 , to take the @entity14 , which is handed to a town that has continually let down its residents and has fallen behind in developing for the better			1
@entity18 magazine , which administers the accolade , said @entity0 had become the ' poor relation ' of @entity2 's cities , while residents and visitors slammed it as a ' grey , shambolic mess '			1
idyllic : this postcard of the promenade along the @entity0 waterfront shows crowds of people and a dance hall , left , where socials were held bleak : this photograph of the promenade today shows much of the shore has been paved			0
experts say it has fallen behind in developing civilised : @entity38 , pictured , was built to relieve the strain of the small cramped streets that people coming into the city had to navigate grey : the road , a major shopping thoroughfare , is just one example of the dreary architecture that helped earn the city the @entity14 the magazine cited planning issues surrounding @entity50 , @entity51 , and missing out on the @entity52 as evidence for @entity0 deserving the award			1
but @entity56 chiefs hit back at the award , branding it an ' attack ' on the oil - rich city 's long - standing reputation			1
the @entity63 are architectural prizes that have been handed out by @entity65 intermittently since 2000			2
the award categories include the @entity68 award , for worst planning decision , the @entity69 , for @entity2 's worst building , and the ' @entity71 on the @entity72 ' for the ' most dismal town ' - ' plook ' is a @entity2 word for pimple			1
public nominations are made via the magazine 's website , with a small group of critics selecting the final winners			1
speaking on @entity0 's win , @entity18 editor @entity83 commented : ' @entity0 is a great city but despite its enviable financial clout and rich heritage legacy it has become the poor relation of the @entity2 cities			1
historic : @entity91 , which stands in the city centre , was founded in 1593			1
it now acts as @entity95 headquarters lost : the granite building now battles for space with newer buildings that reflect an ' anything goes ' attitude , according to @entity18 bustling : @entity0 â€™s historic @entity101 , pictured , and surroundings are among the oldest known parts of the city			1
above , a market in ' the @entity106 ' dreary : the area is now taking up with shops , and lined with the granite buildings that give @entity0 its name - the @entity112 ' it has been left behind by the likes of @entity115 , which has made huge strides to transform its waterfront			0
the time to turn things around is now , in a few years ' time it may well be too late			0
' residents and visitors took to the internet to slam the city 's architecture			1
on social networking site @entity126 , one user said : ' the infrastructure of this city is shambolic and simply ca n't support the ever - growing population , and i 'm convinced that the scale of the problem is now so daunting that no council wants to touch it			1
the @entity63 are architectural prizes that have been handed out by @entity65 intermittently since 2000			2
they were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of @entity2 's key cities			1
the name of the awards comes from a comment by @entity146 , an outspoken critic of modern architecture , who in 1984 described @entity149 ' proposed extension of @entity151 's @entity150 as a ' monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much - loved and elegant friend '			1
the award categories include the @entity68 award , for worst planning decision , the @entity69 , for @entity2 's worst building , and the ' @entity71 on the @entity72 ' for the ' most dismal town '			1
' @entity71 ' is a @entity2 word for pimple			1
public nominations are made via the magazine 's website , with a small group of critics selecting the final winners			1
' they 'd rather sit on their hands , waffling on about what a great and ambitious city @entity0 is , and hoping the next guy will deal with it instead			2
' another online user wrote : ' i remember going to @entity0 for the first time when i was a kid , and just thinking this place is so grey			2
' the buildings are grey , the road is grey , the sky was grey , everything just made me bored as a kid and i left thinking @entity0 was dull			2
' i know @entity0 is the @entity112 , but it needs some colour injected into it			1
' another added : ' when i worked in @entity0 i used to hang around the traffic lights just so i knew i had n't gone colour blind			2
' but the novelty award was slammed by @entity95 bosses who branded it an ' attack ' on the city 's long - standing reputation			1
convener of @entity95 's planning committee , @entity198 , said he was disappointed by the decision			2
@entity200 said : ' i think it 's absolute nonsense how some obscure periodical has come to this decision to no discussion with the city council			1
' people should stop talking down this great city and talk it up			2
this is disheartening , but people will have common sense with their own experience of it being a good place to live			0
' @entity214 , chief executive of @entity215 , said he was pleased with the award as it has put the city into the spotlight			2
he said : ' anything that draws attention to @entity0 can only help people realise how preposterous and ignorant its award is			2
' @entity0 is a stunning city with beautiful parks and gardens , a beach that runs for miles right into the city centre , and some stunning architecture			1
' @entity233 msp @entity231 labelled the decision an ' unwarranted ' attack			0
he said : ' the public criticism of the state of the city centre must be a wake - up call to the @entity241 - led administration that their inept management of the city can not continue			1
' this carbuncle award is very unfair , but it if achieves anything , it must be to see the ludicrous @entity51 scheme brought to a halt before the administration inflicts another disaster upon @entity0			2
' some residents called out the council for refusing to accept the decision			2
commenting online , @entity253 wrote : ' for me the denial from the council towards all this is the single most alarming fact			0
everyone with eyes can see the mess our city centre has now become , and now seems nothing will ever be the wake - up call needed for this lot			1

the city won one of three carbuncle awards handed out today under pressure : council chiefs hit back at the award , branding it an ' attack ' on the city 's long - standing reputation			1
above , @entity38 today character : residents stroll along @entity38 in this historic postcard			0
tourism bosses called the @entity14 ' preposterous ' @entity283 : @entity18 magazine , which administers the accolade , said @entity0 had become the ' poor relation ' of @entity2 's cities ' only course of action left for the city will be to vote them out at next council elections			1
' @entity293 wrote : ' instead of criticising this ' award ' - take a step back please all councillors and see @entity0 for what it really is - what you have been doing to the @entity300 of @entity301 ( or not been doing ) for years			1
' for once - pay attention to the people of @entity0 - and stop lining your own pockets ! ' the ' @entity307 ' award for worst planning decision was handed to @entity309 for demolition of the b - listed @entity311 on @entity312			2

1740 : @entity342 , located at the @entity343 in the west end of @entity0 , was opened			0
