these artists took hanging round town in tracksuits to a new level - stunning shoppers and dog walkers in the @entity6 city of @entity7			1
known as @entity9 , the group infiltrated window archways , squeezed under park benches and piled onto the roofs of suburban homes			1
the conceptual art group bends the rules of street performance and has already impressed city - dwellers in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
this trio positioned themselves in a stone window welcome home : the artists squeeze into spaces which people forget about in their daily lives these teenagers in @entity7 were baffled by the sight of the artists stacked like shopping baskets wearing garish bright tracksuits , they also posed on top of walls , on the side of houses and between electrical boxes			1
@entity38 artist @entity37 thought up the project in 2007 and it has been touring the world since			2
it has already visited @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , @entity69			2
the group 's latest stop in @entity7 saw them ushering audiences from site to site for the two - day event			2
the artist said on his website : ' by placing the bodies in selected spots the interventions provoke a thinking process and produce irritation			0
' bodies in @entity84 invites the residents to walk their own city thus establishing a stronger relationship to their neighbourhood , district and town			2
' the interventions are temporary without leaving any traces behind , but imprints in the eyewitnesses ` memory			0
' photographer @entity96 , who captured the street art in @entity66 , said : ' some of the positions were clearly very strenuous to hold			0
no sooner had the performers " unravelled " themselves , than they had to run on ahead to get into position at another site before the audience arrived			0
' the audience was relatively small so everyone got a chance to have a good look and really have a chance to witness something amazing			0
' at times it all looked a bit surreal but it definitely drew your attention to spaces that you 'd never normally notice			0
it was also huge fun and often the audience 's reaction or that of a passer - by was as interesting as the actual performance			0
' what are they looking at ? a young child is fascinated by the contortionists at a house in @entity7 , @entity6 the performance art has already intruded on everyday life in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 hanging out on the roof : with a pair of purple legs suspended in the air , the artists could be playing an especially creative game of @entity133			1
they are pictured next to houses in @entity7 , @entity6 feeling electric : the ' danger of death ' signs did little to put off this contortionist dressed in a yellow hoodie ball of people : if this group was trying to imitate the post on the other side of the path , they had limited success put on for free in the street and in parks , the performances put a new spin on internet crazes like planking			1

bemused residents rushed between *unusual* spaces in @entity7 , @entity6
artists squeezed into everything from park benches to church windows
