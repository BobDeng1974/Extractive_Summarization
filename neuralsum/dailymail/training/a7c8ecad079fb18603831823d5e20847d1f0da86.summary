pro-life campaigners are often criticised for harassing women seen going into abortion clinics			1
but the tables were turned when a heavily pregnant lady hit back at anti-termination protesters demonstrating outside a @entity9 health centre - leaving them lost for words			1
the verbal dressing - down came as a worker for @entity12 , a @entity14 surgery offering abortion services in @entity16 , confronted @entity18 members and asked them to stop filming to protect patient confidentiality			1
a pregnant woman criticises anti-abortion group @entity18 outside @entity12 in @entity16 @entity18 members denied specifically filming patients going into the surgery and claimed that they were using the cameras to provide evidence against those who accuse them of bullying tactics			1
a pregnant passer - by can then be seen approaching the group as they argue about the use of cameras , in footage uploaded @entity30 by journalist @entity31 on wednesday			1
she tells the protesters : ' you are wrong in what you 're doing			2
' you do n't know why people are doing what they 're doing , but you want to be out here judging and then filming			0
' when one of the female protesters tries to fight back by claiming that she had an abortion in the past , the lady labels her a hypocrite			1
she said : ' you had an abortion but because you 're not happy with what you 're doing , you 're standing out here making other people feel guilty			0
when you had an abortion , that was your choice			0
the pregnant woman tells the protesters that women should have choice ' many people have been abused , you do n't know what their reasons are for , so i think this is so wrong on so many levels			1
' referring to a recent incident in which a newborn baby was found dead in a wheelie bin in @entity64 , she adds : ' there was a baby on the news that got found in the bin			0
' maybe if their mum did n't feel that way because of people like you , that baby would n't have died			0
as the lady walks away , the protesters are left speechless by her words and are unable to argue back ' you think it 's better for them to get rid of it at ten weeks ( in the womb ) or to actually go through with the birth and then kill the child ? ' the unnamed woman goes on to tell the group they should have researched about the local area before protesting as the clinic is near to @entity89 , a charity providing support to vulnerable inner - city children			1
many of the children who go to the charity for help have been sexually abused or forced into sex work			0
the woman said : ' there 's @entity89 round there , where we 're helping thousands and thousands of kids while you 're out here			2
' you are in the wrong place , especially when we have our people that are going through their s * * * , they 're going to @entity89 where we 're meant to help them , then they see this			0
' she adds : ' to be standing out here and making other people feel guilty is so wrong			0
' as the woman walks away , the protesters are left speechless and are unable to argue back			2
since the footage was uploaded , hundreds of people have taken to @entity115 to applaud the woman for her ' inspiring speech '			2
thousands of pounds have also been given to the @entity89 ' give a vulnerable child the gift of @entity122 ' campaign since the video was uploaded earlier today too			1
to donate to @entity89 the campaign , click here the anti-abortion group @entity18 , which was started in 2008 , has been confronting women going into the clinic with posters and leaflets showing pictures of foetuses			1
a spokesman told @entity134 : ' the @entity136 video by @entity31 which reveals the gentle nature by which we hold our displays serves to emphasise that abortion is indefensible			2
' pro-aborts like @entity31 ca nâ€™t defend killing small human beings so he tries ( in vain ) to shame our volunteers for trying to defend the unborn child			0
' - do you know the woman in the footage ? if so please contact the @entity134 newdesk on editorial@mailonline.co.uk or call 020 7938 6000 and ask for the @entity134 newsdesk .			0
