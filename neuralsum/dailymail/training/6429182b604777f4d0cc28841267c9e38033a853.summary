by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 fisherman made the catch of a lifetime while on a fishing holiday in @entity7			1
@entity8 , 78 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , travelled to @entity11 to catch salmon , but stunned locals when he ended up reeling in a 350lb sturgeon			1
the giant fish was so heavy that it towed his boat for half an hour before the pensioner was able to pull his catch in			1
' it looked like a scene from @entity21 ' : the 78 - year - old is more used to catching trout with his fly rod , but managed to hang on while the giant sturgeon towed his boat for over an hour			1
@entity7 guide @entity26 could n't believe the catch and snapped a picture before @entity8 released the giant back into the water			1
mr @entity8 said : ' it looked like a scene from @entity21 ! ' it was the second time we went out , just myself and the guide , and i caught a fish after an hour			1
' i could feel it getting more weight on the line and thought maybe i 'd caught a big one			0
' @entity26 said we 'd bring it in , and he cut off some of the line so we could pull it in			0
it towed us down the river for an hour and eventually it got close enough that we could beat it			2
' it was actually like being in the gym on the weight machine , and you think you 're going to do 20 reps , but the fish was saying you get off when i tell you			2
it 's pulling on your back and also really your whole body			0
you have to be aware of not being pulled off the boat			0
' mr @entity8 , who runs his own business , started fishing in the early 1970s			2
after fly fishing for trout for 20 years he moved on to fishing for salmon			2
although on a salmon - fishing trip in @entity11 , mr @entity8 took some time out to travel to the @entity67 to try his hand at catching white sturgeon , a freshwater fish species native to @entity71			1
the fish are known to reach a maximum weight of more than 1,500lb and can grow up to 20ft long			0
mr @entity8 added : ' it was really that exciting			2
it was a marvellous experience and this time i can tell the story of the one that did n't get away			0
' my dream was to get on about my own weight â€“ that was my fantasy			0
' when it turned out to be 25 stone i could n't believe it			0
' i went to @entity11 two years ago to catch salmon , last year i went back and someone suggested i should try fishing for sturgeon , and this year i decided to give it a go			1
' after this i 'm definitely planning to go back next year ! '			0
