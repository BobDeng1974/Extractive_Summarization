it excluded blacks until 1990 and admitted its first two female members in 2012			0
@entity0 did n't seem fazed by the political dynamite he toyed with , @entity44 reported wednesday			2
he also bantered at the expense of the most populous religious group in the @entity48			0
' we got any @entity50 here ? we got any @entity51 ? ' @entity0 asked from the podium			2
' they 're the ones that drink and do n't admit it			0
' a @entity1 @entity57 campaign strategist told @entity58 on thursday that @entity0 's humorous approach was a deft political move			1
' he had to try and be funny , ' the operative said			0
' the event would have attracted far more criticism , and serious complaints – the election is next tuesday , for gosh 's sake – if he showed up and gave a serious policy speech			1
' ' they would have swept him off the stage if he did than anyway			0
those guys are brutal if you 're boring			0
and it sounds like he was one of the more mild - mannered @entity77 speakers in a while anyway			0
' @entity0 has confirmed that recordings of the event are accurate , but emphasized that he was n't serious			2
' they are great guys , ' he told @entity44			0
the @entity82 , @entity0 continued , expects its speakers ' to be earthy , to make fun of yourself , to make fun of them			1

no recordings of their remarks were readily available on thursday , and the @entity82 could n't be reached for comment			0
two @entity99 activists leaked the @entity0 audio to @entity44			2
@entity0 is a shoe - in to win re-election and could conceivably run for president in 2016 , but his reputation as a supporter of immigration ' amnesty ' would make him unwelcome in many @entity57 circles the group 's iconic meeting place , @entity111 , is legendary for episodes of far more significant @entity48 history			1
it hosted a faction of @entity99 in 1860 who plotted to nominate sen. @entity117 to oppose @entity118 for the presidency a year before a devastating civil war – fought over black slavery – broke out in the @entity27 delegates slept in cots strewn all around the ornate building			0
@entity0 has floated the idea of a long - shot presidential campaign , but the @entity57 strategist said it wo n't happen			1

' they do n't call him " @entity134 " for nothing , ' he jabbed			0
@entity0 campaign spokesman @entity136 told the @entity137 that the senator 's comments were ' delivered in a private roast - type dinner before a well - respected charity in @entity3 '			1
democratic state sen. @entity142 , who is running an unlikely campaign to unseat him , took it all seriously			0
