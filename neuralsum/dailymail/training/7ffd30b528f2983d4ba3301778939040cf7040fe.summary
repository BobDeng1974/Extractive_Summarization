' he had no idea what i had been up to , and he 's always said he loved me no matter what my size was			2
' i had a skirt on so he could see my legs , but when i took my coat off he was absolutely gobsmacked			1
' he could n't believe it			0
he kept looking at me and saying " i ca n't believe it , i ca n't believe it "			0
' @entity6 says she decided to do it because with two children she wanted to be healthy and have more energy @entity17 added : ' our @entity45 sessions were only with the kids so i never actually saw her while i was deployed			1
' it explains a lot			0
