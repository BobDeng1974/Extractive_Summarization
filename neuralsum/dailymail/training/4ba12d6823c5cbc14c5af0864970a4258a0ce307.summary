terrorist group @entity0 may be considering using @entity1 as a suicide bio-weapon against the @entity3 , according to a military expert			1
the virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person who is showing the symptoms – and it would n't be difficult for fanatics to contract it then travel to countries they want to wreak havoc in , according to a military expert			1
capt. @entity14 , @entity15 , a professor of national security affairs at the @entity17 , said that the strategy is entirely plausible			1
in the context of terrorist activity , it does n't take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier			0
' and professor @entity33 , director at @entity35 's @entity34 , agrees that the strategy might be considered			2
he said : ' in some ways it ’s a plausible theory – is fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission			2
they are sufficiently murderous and well - informed to consider it , and they know that we ’ve been remiss in the @entity45			0
' the virus is running rampant in @entity47 , with 3,800 dead in just a matter of months and the first cases appearing in @entity51 at the @entity52 the possibility that @entity0 , also known as @entity55 and @entity0 , could make the situation far worse is one that should be taken very seriously , another expert said			1
in the may 2013 issue of the journal @entity60 , @entity61 , author of the paper @entity64 concluded : ' the threat of an ebola bioterrorist attack in @entity67 is a global health and security concern , and should not be ignored , ' @entity23 reported			0
far from being lone voices on this theory , concern in @entity52 about @entity1 being used as a bioweapon was in fact a catalyst for its $ 5.6billion @entity76 , according to a source familiar with the matter , who did not wish to be named			1
the virus is running rampant in @entity47 , with 3,800 dead in just a matter of months and the first cases appearing in @entity51 at the @entity52 signed off by president @entity82 in 2004 , it ensures generous funding for scientists researching bioweapon counter-measures , as well as accelerating research against chemical , radiological and nuclear agents			1
it also grants the @entity52 government the power to stockpile huge quantities of medical countermeasures			0
however , @entity96 , @entity97 , at the @entity98 , while acknowledging that @entity0 using @entity1 as a weapon is n't out of the question , says that now would not be the best time to employ this strategy			1
she told @entity100 : ' everyone 's looking out for signs of @entity1 at the moment so they 'd be very unlikely to get away with it			1
' the other issue with @entity1 is that it 's very hard to control			1
the militants could just end up wiping themselves out before they 've had the chance to pass it on			0
' for a suicide attack , strapping sticks of dynamite to your chest is far more effective			0
' @entity114 security expert @entity113 , from @entity116 's @entity115 , echoed @entity118 's scepticism			2
he said : ' it is certainly possible for @entity0 to use the ebola virus as it is a cheap and accessible source in @entity47			1
however , considering the @entity122 ’s and international community ’s effort to contain the spread of the virus it will be increasingly difficult to " export " the virus via air transport to other parts of the world			2
it would require a lot of effort and have a low chance of success			0
' he added : ' @entity0 is not currently focusing on the @entity3			1
at the moment @entity0 ’ focus is on expanding its territory and influence in @entity142 and @entity143			1
it is bogged down there			0
within this context i do not see any place for @entity1 as a bio-weapon to be used against any of the opponents			1
it would be too risky as they would likely infect their own fighters and people living in their territory			0
' professor @entity33 added : ' it would be logistically very difficult to get an is fighter to @entity47 , come into contact with @entity1 , wait to find out if they were infected , then leg it to @entity163			1
' the first person diagnosed with @entity1 in the @entity52 died on wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment , and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease			1
the possibility that @entity0 , also known as @entity55 and @entity0 , could make the situation far worse is one that should be taken very seriously , another expert said			1
the checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from @entity47 at five major @entity52 airports			2
the new screenings will begin saturday at @entity180 's @entity179 and then expand to @entity181 and the international airports in @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			0
an estimated 150 people per day will be checked , using high - tech thermometers that do n't touch the skin			0
the @entity189 said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the @entity52 from the three heaviest - hit countries - @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
president @entity196 called the measures ' really just belt and suspenders ' to support protections already in place			0
@entity203 agents now look for people who are obviously ill , as do flight crews , and in those cases the @entity206 is notified			0
as of wednesday , @entity1 has killed about 3,800 people in @entity47 and infected at least 8,000 , according to the @entity122			1
a medical official with the @entity211 in @entity193 who tested positive for @entity1 arrived in the @entity213 city of @entity214 on thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities , authorities said			2
the unidentified medic infected in @entity193 is the second member of the @entity211 mission , known as @entity219 , to contract the virus			0
the first died on september 25			0
he is the third @entity1 patient to arrive in @entity213 for treatment			2
the virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers , sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest - hit countries of @entity193 , @entity195 and @entity194 - places that already were short on doctors and nurses			0
there are no approved medications for @entity1 , so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases , including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from @entity1			2
the survivor 's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus .			0

@entity0 fanatics may be thinking of infecting themselves with @entity1 , says expert
a @entity17 *lecturer* says strategy is entirely plausible
the virus is running rampant in @entity47 , with 3,800 dead in a few months
