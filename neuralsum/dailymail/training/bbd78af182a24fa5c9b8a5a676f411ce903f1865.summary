coalition tensions over immigration boiled over last night after the @entity2 launched a provocative poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ‘ go home ’			1
the @entity6 reacted furiously to the initiative , with party president @entity8 condemning the billboards as the ‘ politics of division ’ , and saying they should be ‘ shredded ’			0
in a separate intervention , @entity13 said the @entity16 ’s immigration policy was ‘ totally illogical ’ and ‘ very damaging ’ to the economy			0
unlikely allies : @entity20 leader @entity19 ( left ) condemned the ' unpleasant ' campaign while @entity6 president @entity8 called for the posters to be shredded the business secretary said that cracking down on foreign students and skilled workers from outside @entity28 when the public is mainly concerned about mass immigration from the @entity30 was ‘ like having a family quarrel and trying to resolve it by kicking the cat ’			1
the giant billboards , which are being driven around on the back of vans , say : ‘ in the @entity37 illegally ? go home or face arrest			1
’ illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ‘ free advice and help with travel documents ’			1
@entity45 immigration minister @entity44 said the controversial poster campaign would encourage illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily – and serve as ‘ an alternative to being led away in handcuffs ’			1
speaking at the launch of the campaign , mr @entity44 said the initiative was ‘ just another part of the reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade ’			0
@entity58 : vans bearing signs asking illegal immigrants to text the government are being driven around @entity62 the initiative is being piloted in six @entity62 boroughs but could be extended nationally if successful			1
the billboards also display the number of illegal migrants arrested recently in the area the vans are visiting			1
the blunt message will also be displayed in leaflets , posters and advertisements in local newspapers			0
critics claim that illegal immigrants face only a minimal risk of deportation			1
the @entity78 home affairs select committee reported this month that the now - defunct @entity81 had left behind a backlog of more than 500,000 cases , which would take 37 years to clear at the current rate of progress			1
overstayed : the @entity2 believes 200,000 people may still be in the @entity37 after their visas have expired but the @entity2 campaign prompted an angry response from the @entity6 part of the @entity16			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ these poster vans were not cleared or agreed by @entity6 in government			0
we are totally committed to tackling illegal immigration but this is a disproportionate , distasteful and ineffective way to do it			1
’ mr @entity8 wrote on @entity97 : ‘ these “ go home ” posters are the politics of division – the billboards must be shredded , and now			2
’ @entity6 peer @entity103 of @entity105 , also raised the ‘ dreadful @entity2 campaign ’ in the @entity110 , saying the posters were ‘ creating a great divide in our communities ’			0
the poster campaign also drew unexpected criticism from @entity37 @entity20 leader @entity19 , who described the initiative as a ‘ diversion ’ from the issue of legal mass immigration from the @entity30			1
help : illegal immigrants who text the new number will be offered free advice on how to get back home mr @entity19 told @entity123 ’s @entity122 programme the posters were a direct response to @entity20 ’s surge in the polls			1
but he said voters wanted action on immigration , not publicity stunts			0
‘ i think the tone of the billboards is nasty , unpleasant , @entity134 , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t think using messages like this will make any difference			0
what will make a difference is enforcing our borders properly			0
‘ it ’s also a diversion : the real problem is n’t illegal immigration , there are perhaps one million illegal immigrants in the country			1
the real problem is that on january 1st next year we ’re opening up our borders to 28million people from @entity151 and @entity152			2
’ meanwhile , mr @entity13 has attacked the government ’s @entity45 - led immigration policy			0
he said there was a sense of ‘ panic ’ among @entity45 ministers in their response to public concern about mass immigration from the @entity30 , which the government can do little about			0
answering questions after delivering the @entity165 annual lecture , mr @entity13 said the immigration policy ‘ does n’t actually deal with the problem that people worry about ’			2
he said implementation of the policy was ‘ very , very damaging in many respects ’			0
mr @entity13 added : ‘ it does n’t sit very easily with being open for business			0
my job is to attract inward investment and show that we are open for business			0
’ he said overseas students were not actually immigrants , but were included in the government ’s cap on immigrants from outside the @entity30			2
‘ it is totally illogical , but that is the policy , ’ he added			0
the row comes as the @entity186 step up both action and rhetoric on immigration in the run - up to the next election			0
@entity192 warned this week that immigration is a ‘ constant drain ’ on public services			2
he also suggested that he wanted to see more action towards meeting his pledge to slash annual net migration – the number of immigrants minus the number emigrating – from more than 200,000 to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,000 .			2

border officials released advert asking illegal immigrants to text them
it warned people in @entity37 illegally to ' go home or face arrest '
nearly 200,000 people are thought to have stayed in @entity37 after visa expired
