hugely costly : an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the @entity2 are affected by @entity3 and genetic factors play a role in its development autism is the most costly medical condition in @entity2 , say researchers			1
it costs the @entity2 £ 32 billion a year - more than heart disease , cancer and stroke combined			1
researchers at the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) have produced the most comprehensive estimate yet of treatment , lost earnings , care and support costs for children and adults with autism			1
autism , or autistic spectrum disorder ( @entity3 ) , including @entity27 ’s syndrome , is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone ’s ability to interact socially and communicate			2
an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the @entity2 are affected by @entity3 and genetic factors play a role in its development			1
a quarter of people with autism are unable to talk , and 85 per cent do not work full time			1
new research , published in the @entity39 , concluded the financial costs of autism in the @entity2 were much higher than previously estimated			1
the overall cost of autism to the @entity2 economy is £ 32.1bn per year , compared to cancer ( £ 12bn ) heart disease ( £ 8bn ) and stroke ( £ 5bn )			1
the study found the cost of supporting someone with autism who did not have intellectual disabilities was £ 0.92 million			2
the cost rose to £ 1.5 million for an individual with autism who is also intellectually impaired			0
the largest costs during childhood are special education and lost earnings by parents			2
among adults with autism , the highest costs were for residential or special living facilities and lifetime loss of earnings by the affected individual			1
the figures also show @entity2 spends just £ 4m per year on autism research , compared to cancer ( £ 590m ) heart disease ( £ 169m ) or stroke ( £ 32m )			1
professor @entity68 from @entity16 , who led researchers from the @entity2 and @entity70 , said between 40 and 60 per cent of people with autism spectrum disorders also have intellectual disabilities			1
he said ‘ what these figures show is a clear need for more effective interventions to treat autism , ideally in early life , making the best use of scarce resources ,			0
‘ new government policies are also needed to address the enormous impact on families			0
’ comprehensive : researchers at the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) have produced the most thorough estimate yet of treatment , lost earnings , care and support costs for autisim sufferers @entity92 , ceo of @entity93 , the @entity2 ’s leading autism research charity , said ‘ we care about the human stories behind these numbers			1
autism is life long and can make independent living and employment hugely challenging			0
this is part of why it has a greater economic impact than other conditions			0
‘ there is an unacceptable imbalance between the high cost of autism and the amount we spend each year on researching how to fundamentally change the outlook for people			2
‘ we know that progress is possible			0
the right research would provide early interventions , better mental health , and more independence			0
but right now we spend just £ 180 on research for every £ 1million we spend on care			0
’ autism researcher professor @entity117 , from the @entity119 , said ‘ the cost figures show that autism affects all of us in society , every day , regardless of whether or not we have a family member or friend with autism			0
‘ so we all need to play a part in making things better			0
more research funding would mean that we could conduct studies to transform lives			0
’ in a recent survey by @entity93 , 90 per cent of parents and 89 per cent of adults with autism said that there was a need for greater scientific understanding of autism			2
one father said ‘ we should be making science work harder to make life more bearable			2
’ a woman , who was diagnosed with autism aged 50 , said ‘ i look for interventions , but there do not seem to be interventions for people my age			0
