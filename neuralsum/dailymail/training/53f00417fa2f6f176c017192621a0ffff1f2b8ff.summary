by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 16 august 2013 ' the other day a lady in the @entity2 leaned over me and put her hands on my shoulders while she talked to someone else over my head , ' says @entity8 , 37 , a primary school teacher from @entity9			1
' people stare , take pictures with smartphones , are rude , physically touch us or pat you on the head ... it happens a lot and it 's people of all ages			2
' this is what life looks like when you live with achondroplasia , one of the most common forms of dwarfism			2
it affects between one in 15,000 and one in 40,000 babies born every year			1
happy family : @entity8 ( centre ) with her husband @entity33 and 13 - year - old daughter , @entity31 features on @entity36 documentary @entity35 @entity8 and her daughter @entity31 , 13 , were both born with the disorder and along with her husband @entity33 the three of them are the focus of a new @entity36 documentary : my dwarf family			1
the hour - long programme follows the trio as they go about their daily life , and @entity8 insists that the one - off documentary shows life as it really is for those with achondroplasia			1
like others with the condition , she 's had to get used dealing with practical difficulties and harassment on a regular basis and in the show addresses concerns about the future of her daughter as she enters her teenage years			1
' i do n't think body image will take over at all , ' explains @entity8			1
she 's always attracted stares , so at 14 she 's used to that			0
' she 's obviously delighted she 's turning into a young woman but she 's already had to come to terms with her body			0
' for @entity8 herself , tackling her teenage years was made easy by her supportive parents			1
' i was just in a very positive environment and never let my height stop me			0
' i 've fulfilled everything i wanted to do			0
the only big issue was getting a boyfriend at peer age			0
that was the biggest , no , only drawback			0
' like others with achondroplasia , a genetic disorder that affects bone growth , @entity8 has a normal sized trunk but drastically shortened legs			1
as a result , getting around requires much forward - planning , but this notwithstanding , emphasises @entity8 , she and her family are totally normal			1
@entity8 believes that some famous dwarves use their disorder as currency , but rates actor @entity90 : ' he 's a man who happens to be a dwarf			1
if @entity31 ever wanted to go into acting , he 'd be the one i 'd tell her to look at			1
' normal : @entity8 hopes the documentary will show viewers that small people are just like everyone else couple : @entity100 and @entity101 also feature in @entity35 and hope to have children one day ' i wanted people to see a different representation of a small family on television , ' she explains			1
' the programme offers different perspectives [ on living with achondroplasia ]			2
' other programmes showing small families have been quite negative but i wanted to show that we 're just normal people with normal difficulties			1
' we raise our daughter telling her she can be whatever she wants to be just like everyone else			2
' one such negative representation comes , thinks @entity8 , from performers such as @entity121 who are all too ready to make comic currency from their condition			1
' a few years ago , he [ @entity121 ] appeared at a comedy awards show with @entity126 , sitting on his shoulder			2
' i just thought no ... little boys sit on people 's shoulders and he 's a grown man			2
he 's showing people that he 's happy to be treated as a child and i just think that 's not the right message			0
' i 've got nothing against the guy - he has a career and is trying to do a lot for awareness - but you have to think about whole tv audience			0
we need to get rid of the idea that dwarves are there to be laughed at			0
' one actor who does meet with her approval is @entity148 ' @entity90 , who plays the scheming @entity150			1
' he 's a dwarf character but that 's not the point of the role , ' she explains			0
' he 's a man who happens to be a dwarf			0
if @entity31 ever wanted to go into acting , he [ @entity90 ] would be the one i 'd tell her to look at			1
' whatever career @entity31 eventually chooses , her ' no - nonsense ' mother will be right behind her			2
at the moment though , she 's got more immediate matters on her mind			0
' i hope people will realise that it 's about getting to know the person rather than the difference , ' she says of tonight 's documentary			2
' one of the beautiful things about my relationship with @entity33 is that height has never been an issue			0
he fell in love with me for me			0
' apart from practical difficulties , we 're just normal people who do normal things			0
' my @entity35 is on @entity178 tonight at 9pm			0
