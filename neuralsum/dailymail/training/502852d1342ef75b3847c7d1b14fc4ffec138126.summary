@entity0 is offering @entity2 firms cash ‘ bribes ’ of almost £ 1,000 a time to take on foreign workers			1
thousands of youngsters are also being offered payments totalling more than £ 1,100 to take a job in @entity2 under the @entity9 scheme			1
the extraordinary initiative appears to directly undermine @entity12 efforts to persuade firms to take on @entity2 workers as the recovery takes hold			2
in an interview with the @entity18 yesterday the business minister @entity16 said firms had a duty to hire @entity2 rather than taking the ‘ easy option ’ of filling vacancies with well - trained foreign workers			1

yesterday more than 800,000 @entity2 jobs were being advertised through the scheme – more than half the total across @entity46			0
these incentives come at a time when more than half of vacancies in the @entity2 are filled by foreigners			0
it is not known how many have taken advantage of the @entity28 scheme			1
a @entity2 @entity64 source said the @entity28 was effectively ‘ bribing ’ firms to take foreign workers			1
party leader @entity66 said the initiative was ‘ utterly reprehensible ’ at a time when youth unemployment in this country stands at nearly one million			0
he added : ‘ with two and a half million people unemployed in the @entity2 , of which 958,000 are under 25 , every job vacancy counts			0
‘ yet here we have the @entity28 , which we already grossly overfund , advertising our jobs to people outside the @entity2 and even giving them the upper hand by offering financial support to get interviews here and move here			2
we are essentially paying the @entity28 to give away @entity2 jobs			2
’ business minister @entity16 ( left ) criticised @entity2 firms for taking the ' easy option '			1
@entity64 leader @entity66 added fuel to the fire by saying unemployment ca n't be improved while the @entity2 is a member of the @entity28 the @entity28 scheme , which was launched last year , is known as @entity89 , and is designed to help ease the @entity28 ’s chronic youth unemployment problem			1
the @entity2 provides about 13 per cent of the scheme ’s budget			0

the scheme is open to all young @entity28 nationals aged 18 to 30 and could attract thousands of youngsters to @entity2 from struggling southern @entity46 countries which have unemployment rates up to three times as high as the @entity2 ’s , such as @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			1
mr @entity16 yesterday said it is ‘ companies ’ social duty , to look at employing locally first ’			0
but mr @entity66 said the revelations about the @entity0 scheme gave the lie to @entity12 claims that immigration could be controlled while remaining in the @entity28			0
he added : ‘ for the minister to blame @entity2 businesses when he is taxing them in order to send the money to @entity0 to fund foreign jobseekers to compete with @entity2 workers is so unfair as to be outrageous			1
‘ we have said from the start we simply can not improve unemployment in the @entity2 while being a member of the @entity28			2
’ an @entity28 spokesman stressed that @entity2 youngsters were able to use the scheme to access jobs elsewhere in @entity46			1
