when @entity1 took a photo of his grandfather in hospital , he hoped it would be an image he could treasure after the pensioner was told his bladder cancer was terminal			1
however when mr @entity1 examined the picture he noticed there was a chilling figure of a woman behind his grandfather , @entity14			1
stunned , he showed staff at the @entity16 the photograph who went on to describe the ' long haired blonde girl ' , who they claim , a lot of patients see lurking at the end of their beds			1
and the ghostly figure may have had an impact of mr large as he has since been released from hospital and sleeping better than before , despite the previous diagnosis			1

' a few people suggested it looked like a reflection but there is literally nothing for it to reflect off			0
' mr @entity1 added : ' my gran told the ward manager she needed to speak to him about something and the second she said she had a picture of a ghost he described it perfectly			1

every time i feel like there is a presence in the room			0
' i 've just got a feeling that whoever it is , is watching over me			0
this is the first time i 've actually seen her but i 've had the feeling she 's been there a while			2
' it 's the strangest thing			2
i ca n't explain it			0
