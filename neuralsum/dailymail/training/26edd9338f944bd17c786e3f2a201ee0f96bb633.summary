statistics released by passenger rights specialist refund.me reveal that one in every four passengers in the @entity1 are affected by delays of at least 15 minutes , the second highest number in @entity4 , behind one in every 3 @entity13 passengers			2
it is estimated that as many as 575,000 @entity1 could be eligible to claim compensation for delays , cancellations , missed connections and overbooking by airlines , but few actually do			1

left waiting : one in four @entity1 passengers are affected by flight delays , according to statistics by refund.me worst offenders : @entity30 in @entity31 ( pictured ) and @entity36 are among the worst for disrupted flights all flights that leave from an @entity52 airport , regardless of airline or destination , are covered by @entity53 which guarantees eligible passengers compensation of up to £ 475 for disruptions			1
