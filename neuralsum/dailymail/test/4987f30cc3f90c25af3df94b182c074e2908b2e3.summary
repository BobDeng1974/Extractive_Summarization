next summer there will be a new ship in the @entity3 fleet – but it will be familiar to seasoned cruisers who have sailed on @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
the mid-size ship , with an on - board climbing wall , is sailing away from @entity11 to @entity3 and will get a new name , yet to be announced			1
so many newly constructed floating resorts come out of shipyards these days – @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 all this year – and it is good news that tried and tested , smaller ships built on classic lines do not just sail off into the sunset or to the breaker ’s yard , but are reinvented and relaunched , sometimes several times over			1
what will it be next ? the @entity7 will be transformed by @entity3 , and launched under a new name next summer take @entity28 , ‘ new flagship ’ of the @entity30 , recently christened in @entity31			1
@entity28 started life as the @entity33 , built in 1985 for @entity34			1
it has had a colourful life , including providing a haven for victims of @entity38 in 2005 and acting as a hotel for the @entity40 in @entity41 in 2014			0
it is hard to believe that luxurious little @entity43 , chartered by the @entity44 for her 80th birthday family cruise around @entity46 in 2006 , was the busy car ferry and @entity49 ship @entity43 for 25 years from its launch in 1964 until transformed in 1989 into the country - house hotel - style cruise ship she is today			1
her former sister ship , the 98 - passenger @entity55 , was sold off in 2009 , amid rumours she was to become a private yacht			2
three years later she reappeared , refitted for 114 passengers as @entity61			0
before : the cruise ship @entity62 of @entity34 docked in @entity63 along the @entity64 after : the renamed and renovated @entity28 , a new flagship of @entity66 then there ’s @entity69 ’s smallest ship , the 700 - passenger @entity70			1
she was built in 2001 as ‘ @entity72 ’ – the last of eight ‘ @entity74 ’ ships			2
the ship became @entity76 for @entity77 , serving the company for four years , then she was @entity79 for @entity80			2
she became @entity70 in 2011 , named by @entity81 in @entity82			2
some of @entity70 ’s similar sisters are now @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
meanwhile , @entity77 has operated the same ship twice			0
the first @entity76 , built in 1989 , was originally intended as a @entity90 spy vessel			0
she sailed for the one - ship cultural cruises company , accommodating 350 passengers , from 1996 until 2003 , when , to the dismay of her loyal passengers ( known as the @entity97 ) , she was replaced by @entity76 , with her 650 berths			0
before : the luxury cruise ship @entity55 moored in @entity100 , @entity101 island of @entity102 after : now transformed into @entity104 cruise ship , sailing out of in @entity105 to the @entity97 ’ joy , the more intimate @entity76 returned to @entity77 in 2008 and was given a multi-million - pound makeover during 2011			1
@entity108 has just four ships , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
they are all pre-loved and characterful and have been refurbished and even ‘ stretched ’ in the case of @entity110			0
the ship , built in 1988 and previously owned by @entity117 as @entity110 , grew by 100ft , with 93 cabins added when she was added to the @entity121 fleet in 2007			2
before : @entity69 's smallest cruise ship , @entity70 , sails along @entity123 after : @entity70 became @entity124 for @entity77 , serving the company for four years , and then she was @entity79 for @entity80			0

next summer @entity3 will launch the transformed @entity8 ’s @entity7 as the new ship in their fleet
it has not been announced what she will be named yet
transformation of ships is common , as shown by @entity136 becoming the @entity28
