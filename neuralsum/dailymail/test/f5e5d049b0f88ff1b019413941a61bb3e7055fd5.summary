out there in the desert , the mirage continues to shimmer for @entity3			2
the identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze			0
first it looks like @entity8			2
and in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth ? the initial lure has been @entity8 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
now the siren call is @entity9 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
for two years @entity3 has been so close to fighting @entity8 that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd			1
yet each time he reaches out , the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the @entity27			0
now the image of @entity9 dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by @entity32 could become reality one starlit @entity34 night			2
after waiting and waiting for @entity8 , @entity3 could be set to face @entity9 a fight with @entity9 , preparing to face @entity8 on may 2 , is on the cards for @entity20 the handsome young prince of @entity39 boxing will pay a flying visit to @entity17 on may 2 , there to watch the @entity9 and the @entity41 dispute the richest fight of all time			1
win or lose , @entity9 could await @entity3 come winter			1
@entity45 's @entity44 with @entity3 @entity46 , the @entity9 ’s vintage promoter , has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in @entity20 this november or december			1
@entity3 , the stand - by for @entity9 had @entity8 refused the @entity50 , is @entity46 ’s first choice for that extravaganza in the @entity53			1
once @entity9 ’s sparring partner , now @entity3 says : ‘ i want this fight			1
i would love to box @entity9			0
we ’ve been looking at an event in @entity58 and @entity20 is only a short drive away			0
it ’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world			0
’ as a hero of the @entity65 world , @entity3 would be a huge attraction there			1
he now has initials which are the @entity69 equivalent of a cbe behind his name			0
his father and mother have just returned from @entity74 where , on their son ’s behalf , they received from president @entity78 the @entity79 - the president ’ s @entity81 for pride in performance			0
@entity46 is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘ nice young man ’ from @entity87 : ‘ @entity3 has great speed			2
maybe the only guy as fast as @entity9			0
and his recent performances have been impressive			0
this would be an outstanding fight			0
’ assuming that @entity3 wins his interim bout with @entity96 in @entity97 next month , all that would appear to stand between him and his long - awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between @entity9 and @entity8			1
promoter @entity46 ( left ) , with @entity9 and @entity100 after the 2009 win over @entity102 , rates @entity3 highly @entity103 seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of may 2nd , even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself money another couple of hundred million dollars			1
either way , @entity8 will conclude his enriching six - fight contract with the @entity112 cable network in @entity113 in september			2
that timing rules out @entity3 as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of @entity118 would not end in time for him to prepare fully			0
but if it ’s not a re-match and @entity8 finds another opponent , @entity119 is a natural for both of them			0
@entity9 prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and @entity3 says : ‘ @entity127 or december is perfect for me			1
’ furthermore , it is highly unlikely that if @entity8 beats @entity9 he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents			2
@entity8 will end his six - fight deal with @entity112 in september , which wo n't work for @entity3 @entity9 works out with trainer @entity100 at their base at @entity135 in @entity136 and @entity3 suspects that will be the upshot in vegas : ‘ i actually think that once @entity8 gets through @entity9 ’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him			1
‘ @entity9 has speed and power but @entity8 has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in			2
‘ the longer it goes the harder it will get for @entity9 and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round			2
’ @entity3 has affection as well as respect for his old spar - mate , so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself			0
@entity3 believes @entity9 will struggle more with @entity8 the longer their mega-fight goes on so he says : ‘ i ’ll just watch it with a professional eye			1
and there is a chance that if @entity8 ’s legs really are slowing down that @entity9 will catch up with him - and he can punch			2
’ by way of further irony , @entity3 has been working lately to add to his high - speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight @entity8			1
hidden away in a unit in a business park in @entity173 , across the @entity174 from @entity175 , is the gym in which trainer @entity177 hones the talents of @entity3 and his long - time protege @entity179 , who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay - off			0
@entity3 has to first overcome @entity96 ( left ) , who was decked six time by @entity9 , on may 29 in @entity97 but as his higher education continues under @entity177 , he is buckling down			1
partly in the knowledge , at 28 , that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered			0
he says : ‘ i ’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for @entity8 because i would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound - for - pound in the world			2
now i have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late			0
‘ @entity8 and @entity9 are getting closer to retirement and if i do n’t fight one of them soon it may never happen			1
’ that is one of the reasons why @entity3 puts on hold a @entity202 with @entity203 , preferring to focus on selling himself in @entity113 and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at @entity9 or @entity8			1
@entity203 ( left ) is fighting @entity207 ( right ) in the @entity208 and @entity3 says he has to wait to face him does his may 29 fight with @entity96 - recently floored six times by @entity9 in @entity211 - help that crusade ? ‘ @entity96 ’s a better fighter than @entity207 ( @entity203 ’s world title challenger next month )			1
he ’s world lightweight champion and he ’s fought at a far higher level than @entity215 can wait			0
’ @entity3 says : ‘ being at ringside ( on may 2 ) will be a bit frustrating but i accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see			1
so no. i wo n’t be feeling any resentment			0
’ it is not much more than a half - hour ’s flight from @entity173 to @entity17			0
@entity3 is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to @entity34 .			0

@entity3 could be set to face @entity9 in @entity20 , @entity21
@entity3 's hopes of taking on @entity8 in @entity17 have faded
@entity9 's promoter @entity46 has a mega offer for a @entity21 fight late in 2015
@entity3 is a hero of the @entity65 world and his lure in the @entity53 is clear
the @entity237 will be ringside when the @entity41 fights the @entity9 on may 2
@entity3 must first win interim bout with @entity96 in @entity97 on may 29
