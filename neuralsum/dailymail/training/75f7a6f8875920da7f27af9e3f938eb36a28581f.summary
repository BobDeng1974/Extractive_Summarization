leaving his £ 2.5million home with a wry smile yesterday , @entity0 did n’t look like a man facing financial ruin after losing his @entity6 libel trial			1
but that may be because the 58 - year - old millionaire politician has calculated he can pay off his hefty £ 2million legal bill in a matter of months			1
mr @entity0 ’s political career was thought to be in tatters after a high court judge ruling that he did call police officers ‘ f * * * ing plebs ’ in a foul - mouthed confrontation in @entity16 two years ago			1
but the former cabinet minister last night confirmed he planned to stand again as mp for @entity21 at the election			1
@entity0 pictured leaving his home yesterday - the day after a judge ruled he did call police officers ' f * * * ing plebs ' in a foul - mouthed confrontation mr @entity0 reportedly believes he can ‘ wipe the slate clean ’ by standing again and winning			2
he had a majority of 17,000 at the last election and is thought to believe he can restart his political career in a ‘ new ball game ’			0
and he can draw comfort from the fact that business is booming in his private - sector work as a consultant to firms offering services such as offshore banking to the super rich			1
since last november , the former investment banker has made more than £ 150,000 for just 28 days ’ work , dwarfing the ‘ basic ’ £ 67,060 mp ’s salary			1

details of the @entity50 ’s lucrative sideline emerged yesterday as the row over @entity6 continued			2
a veteran officer who was on duty at the time said it was a ‘ nonsense incident ’ which need n’t have ended up in court if @entity57 had simply drawn a line under it			0
@entity60 , who recently retired after 30 years in the @entity61 , criticised the force ’s handling of the row , saying no one – including mr @entity0 – should have lost their job over the 63 - second exchange at the @entity16 gates			1
the constable , who heard part of the conversation in september 2012 when mr @entity0 exploded with anger at officers who refused to open the gate for him to cycle through , said : ‘ mr @entity0 lost his sense of humour			1
who has n’t lost their sense of humour at work ? a still image , issued by the @entity61 , shows the moment of the heated exchange between police officers and @entity0 ‘ it was all totally unnecessary			2
’ he told the @entity88 that he wrote to his superiors , setting out what had happened , in the hope that the @entity61 could put the matter ‘ into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there ’			0
but he said : ‘ they were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was , but i was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest			0
it could have been said that it is a minor incident that has been leaked to the newspapers and let ’s all move on			0
but of course we did n’t move on and we ended up all at the @entity112			0
’ he accused the @entity113 of ‘ jumping on the bandwagon ’ and criticised met commissioner sir @entity116 ’s handling of the affair , saying : ‘ i think he could have done more at the time			0
’ yesterday @entity121 said it was ‘ never right to be abusive or rude ’ to a police officer , and added : ‘ the judge has made very clear his verdict and i think everyone should accept that verdict and move on			0
’ on thursday a high court judge castigated the ‘ childish ’ mp , ruling that he did shout at pc @entity130 : ‘ you do n’t run this f * * * * * * government			0
you ’re f * * * * * * plebs			0
’ left , mr @entity0 is pictured leaving the @entity112 in central @entity135 after having lost the ' plebgate ' libel case			1
pictured right , pc @entity130 speaks to reporters after the judge delivered his verdict the devastating ruling came at the end of a complex libel trial after mr @entity0 sued @entity142 , publishers of @entity143 , over the allegation , and mr @entity130 countersued the mp			1
mr @entity0 was ordered to pay costs of £ 300,000 by january 3 and may face a total bill of £ 2million as he will have to pay the other side ’s legal fees and damages to mr @entity130			1
his law firm @entity150 also faces an estimated £ 1million bill after failing to get documents relating to their budget into the court in time , meaning it had to represent mr @entity0 on a ‘ no win , no fee basis ’			1
