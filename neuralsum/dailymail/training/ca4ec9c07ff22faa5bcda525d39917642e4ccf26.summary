by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 08:38 est , 8 may 2012 the information was revealed in a new genetic study of horses across @entity4 and @entity5 - which dated domestication to around 6,000 years ago , and a far narrower area than previously thought one herd of horses tamed in the wide - open grasslands shared by @entity13 , southwest @entity8 and @entity9 could be the ancestor of all modern horses			1
the information was revealed in a new genetic study of horses across @entity4 and @entity5 - which dated domestication to around 6,000 years ago , and a far narrower area than previously thought			1
the research followed 16 years of collecting hair samples from more than 300 horses in @entity8 , @entity23 , @entity13 , @entity9 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity27 - areas where horses were the first to be domesticated and were n't too heavily bred			1
researchers generally date domestication to about 6,000 years ago , but genetic evidence taken from modern - day horses has suggested a wide variety of ancestors , raising the possibility that horses were tamed independently in several different places			2
the @entity39 's @entity38 said she and her colleagues had used a combination of genetics and maths to narrow down the origin of horse domestication to the ‘ western @entity47 steppe ’ - an area now shared by @entity9 , southwest @entity8 and @entity13			0

@entity38 said that fellow researchers took hair samples from ‘ local village - type horses , ’ simple animals whose genetic profiles would be less likely to have been deformed by inbreeding or crossbreeding typical of their @entity59 cousins			0
she said the horses ' genetic profiles were compared to various scenarios plugged into established mathematical models that measure how populations spread and change over time			0
the results suggested that the wide diversity of horse dna could be explained by the frequent breeding of domesticated male horses with wild mares brought in by early horseback riders because ‘ breeding with existing stock was too slow , ’ @entity38 said , speculating that early societies might have used wild females ‘ because they 're a bit more tractable			0
’ a horse on the @entity8 plains today - researchers said all horses might be descended from a herd in the @entity8 steppes tributary leading a horse , relief , @entity87 , from @entity88 ( who ruled 721 - 705 bc ) : researchers generally date domestication to about 6,000 years ago @entity91 , a professor of evolutionary genetics at @entity93 who was n't involved with the research , said he believed the methodology was sound			2
the research , published monday in the @entity97 , was funded by @entity99 's @entity98 , the @entity100 , and the @entity102 - based @entity101 .			0
