it 's @entity1 time - and that song is back			2
the @entity5 one i mean , originally ( and brilliantly ) released to bring relief to the terrible @entity8 famine of 1984			1
they 've changed the lyrics this time , mainly to focus on the @entity12 outbreak in @entity13 , but also to spare a few blushes			2
in the original , @entity16 's stars sang of ' no snow in @entity13 … where no rain nor rivers flow '			2
that did n't quite key with the geography of the continent , still less so @entity8 , where the @entity25 originates , half the country gets more rain than @entity28 , and higher mountains are snow - capped all year round			1
green and pleasant land : the @entity32 present a different side to @entity8 than many expect ironically perhaps , one enduring legacy of the @entity5 song is that , even 30 years on , @entity8 feels like a distinctly odd place for a holiday			1
you think of it as a country in need of aid rather than visitors			2
i 'm not sure i would have gone there myself if i had n't been a supporter of the charity @entity48 , which takes in unwanted computers and gives them a second life in @entity53			0
@entity48 has set up computer rooms in more than 200 @entity8 schools			1
come and see how it works , said the charity 's @entity58 chairman @entity57 , and then we 'll go for a trek in the @entity32 mountains			2
a few weeks later i was on a minibus being shuttled to @entity48 's hq in @entity65 , a city of three million that feels like a small town			2
a visit to @entity68 in @entity65 is something i 'd recommend to anyone going to @entity8 , partly because the work it does is so good			1
its hq also happens to be next to the @entity76 brewery , where waiters in bright blue jackets heft around trays of frothing @entity8 lager			1
it is a fun place to start your travels			0
hidden treasures : @entity8 is home to the staggering rock - cut church of @entity87 , at @entity88 if you 're on a short trip , you 'll want to move on pretty soon to the countryside			1
at the crack of dawn on day two , we were on a plane to @entity96 , one of @entity8 's medieval capitals			1
the town is most famous for its compound of royal palaces , outside one of which stands a lion cage where @entity105 kept the last living emblems of his imperial rule			0
but its modern life proved just as compelling			0
@entity8 , as is swiftly evident , is a strange place			1
and the oddness begins with its staple food , injera			0
this is a kind of bread , disarmingly flannel - ­ like in texture , which is laid out as a tablecloth before mounds of hot curried beef and vegetables are piled on top			0
you tear off bits of injera to mop them up			0
even odder , though , was the nightlife			0
we stumbled upon a strip of basement bars , and ventured into one rather jolly venue where locals danced in traditional fashion with rapid - fire jerks of their shoulders , before slithering to the floor			0
travelling by minibus from @entity96 towards the @entity32 is one of the great journeys in @entity13			0
a few miles out of town you are in a countryside that seems utterly of another era , one where people still harvest and thresh by hand			2
into the heart of the matter : the rock - hewn churches of @entity88 are among the country 's greatest wonders and then you start climbing into the highlands , where mountain vistas open up for hundreds of miles across the rift valley			1
it is literally breathtaking as you climb to an altitude of about 11,500ft and the air visibly chills			0
a trek in the @entity156 is an @entity8 highlight			1
its core is a national park , sparsely populated except by troupes of sandwich - stealing monkeys			0
we walked along the edge of a ridge , gasping in the thin air and at the endless ripple of peaks and valleys visible all the way to the @entity171 - the area where the worst of the famine took place in the 1980s			0
above us wheeled vultures , kites and eagles , and in the morning , after a night spent in a sub-zero camp , we emerged to frosty meadows and a mountaintop white with hailstones			0
a helping hand : @entity183 ( right ) has been a beneficiary of @entity48 's recycled computers programme i thought it would be hard to beat the @entity32 experience but @entity88 , our next stop , did so			1
this isolated town , perched amid craggy mountains , is one of the more obscure wonders of the world			2
it was transformed in the 12th century into a subterranean ' @entity196 ' as its rulers set tens of thousands of builders to work , cutting chapels and churches into the rock			1
it sounds straightforward enough until you realise that they are cut vertically down into the stone , each one a perfect basilica			0
you wander around this extraordinary complex to be greeted by monks and priests dressed in white robes and guarding their innermost sanctums , in which are housed replicas of the @entity215			0
it was at @entity88 , too , that i had my most memorable charity experience while visiting the local secondary school			1
we were greeted by a girl called @entity221 ( par for the course in @entity8 names )			1
' welcome , ' she said			0
' my favourite subject is physics			0
one day i want to be prime minister of @entity8			1
we have very few books and not many teachers but now , thanks to @entity48 , we have computers			0
i want to thank you , but can you please send more ? ' a final note : another of the oddities of @entity8 is its calendar			1
the country follows the @entity238 rather than the @entity239 ( @entity58 changed to the latter in 1752 ) , so @entity1 will this year be celebrated in @entity8 on january 7 , 2015			1
food for thought : @entity243 tried several @entity8 delicacies , including wat and injera and that 's not the end of the matter			1
the current year in @entity8 , which began on our september 11 , is 2007			2
so if you fancy reliving @entity1 2007 , there 's still time to make plans … @entity254 travelled with @entity255 ( @entity256 , 020 7736 3968 ) , which offers small - group and personalised tours of @entity8			1
@entity48 ( @entity259 , 020 8265 7681 ) welcomes visitors to its centres in @entity53 and , by arrangement , to the schools it equips			0
if the company you work for has spare computers , @entity48 would love to send them to @entity183			0
@entity8 : @entity269 ( @entity270 , £ 17.99 ) is a terrific guidebook , worth its weight in birr ( the local currency ) .			2

for many people , @entity8 is is still remembered for its terrible famines
but the country is a *fascinating* and safe *destination* for *intrepid* travellers
the rock churches of @entity88 are among the country 's greatest wonders
