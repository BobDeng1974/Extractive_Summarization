a social network for sex toys has been revealed that aims to allows users to meet and interact with each other easily has been launched			1
called @entity6 , the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex toys from differentmanufacturers easily			1
it even hopes to develop games and live broadcasts using the technology , where one performer can control thousands of devices around the globe			1
the @entity25 - based cyberdildonics company @entity6 is currently beta - testing the system			1
' @entity30 is a software company , we want to take off the shelf products and work with them , the firm 's founder @entity27 , who would not reveal his last name , told dailymail.com			1
' we are working with robotic devices that we are adapting for this			2
' the firm is initially adapting a $ 199 game controller with a built in vibration function			2
' we met the guys who invented this , and it fitted perfectly			2
' eventually we will sell out own devices - we have some great ideas			2
' ' we are an ambitious startup with the goal of getting people interacting physically on the internet , ' it says			1
' with this in mind , our beta explores ways that intimacy can be augmented by technology			2
' using sophisticated haptic teledildonics two or more @entity6 users are able to touch each other and even have sex at any distance			1
' the network uses off - the - shelf sex toys and already existing technologies and connects them using its network			1
it allows teledildonic devices — dildos , vibrators , and sleeves , for example — to interact with each other using real - time bidirectional force feedback			2
called @entity6 , the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex aids from different manufacturers easily			1
' on the next generation haptic social network innovative and affordable haptic peripherals empower @entity6 users to come together and touch each other in tangible , stimulating ways ; from holding hands and kissing up to and including full penetrative sex whether your partner is across the room or across an ocean , ' the firm says			1
founder @entity27 , says the effect is extremely realistic			2
' @entity30 is a software platform we 're developing to enable people to connect physically over distance , ' he told @entity95			1
' it feels like the act of sex			0
while you 're thrusting , i 'm being penetrated			0
i 'm feeling the resistance			0
' elsewhere , people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of @entity106			1
when one user squeezes their @entity108 ( pictured ) , the corresponding @entity109 in their loved one 's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand , simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other			0
when one user squeezes their @entity108 , the corresponding @entity122 in their loved one 's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand , simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other			0
when combined with @entity133 , for example , the experience is said to be ' immersive '			0
@entity122 uses haptic technology , or ' tactile feedback ' to mimic the sensation of hand - holding through two devices			0
once the @entity140 have connected to each other through the internet , when one user squeezes their device , the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held			0
they do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing , two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real , and one integrated ' squeeze bar ' to replicate holding hands			0
a multicolour led will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting			0
' for a granddaughter calling grandma with special news , for a husband far away from a wife , for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother 's touch , for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok , @entity108 connects – as simply , subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you , ' the company says			0
' while there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet , the tactile element has been missing – until now			0
with @entity108 , you can cut through the distance and share that smallest gesture – the squeeze of the hand – that means so much			0

@entity187 will allow *gadgets* from different manufacturers to work together
can allow people to remotely control their partners toys from anywhere
@entity195 based @entity6 hopes to develop games and live broadcasts
