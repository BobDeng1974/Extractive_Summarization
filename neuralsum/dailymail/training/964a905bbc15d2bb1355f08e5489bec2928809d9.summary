a 10 - year - old girl in @entity1 has been paralyzed for almost a year with a rare inflammation of the brain and her family is blaming a flu vaccine			1
according to @entity7 , her daughter @entity6 was living a perfectly healthy and happy life until last year			0
' she ( used to ) love school , she was running , playing , singing in the church choir , ' @entity7 told @entity11			0
suddenly sick : @entity7 said that @entity6 was a healthy nine year old when she got her annual flu shot and suddenly became sick last november , @entity7 took @entity6 for her seasonal flu shot			1
she was healthy for the next couple of days , playing freeze tag with friends a few days before @entity17			2
the next day , @entity7 found her daughter paralyzed in her bed , able to open her eyes but unable to move her body or speak			0
@entity7 and her husband called an ambulance , and at the hospital received a sobering diagnosis - @entity6 had a rare infection of the brain called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , or @entity29			1
almost a year later , @entity6 still can not speak and must be carried to the bathroom by her father			0
most of her day is spent in a hospital bed , which is kept in the @entity35 ' living room because it is too big to fit in her bedroom , according to a @entity39 page set up by the family			0
now the @entity35 are saying ' the doctors wo n’t confirm it or deny it , ' but they believe the flu shot was to blame			2
paralyzed : @entity6 is almost completely nonverbal and can hardly move , remaining mainly in her bed or wheelchair healthy : @entity7 said that @entity6 loved singing and playing before her paralysis from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ' her father @entity50 and i are certain , ' she told @entity52 , ' due to all of our research , that this was what caused @entity6 ’s condition			1
' research by the @entity59 found that in five percent of @entity29 cases , the patient had received a vaccine in the month before symptoms started			1
in 2008 , a 75 - year - old woman developed @entity29 two days after being vaccinated against influenza , eventually experiencing numbness and paralysis , before dying shortly afterwards			2
however , doctors do not recommend against the vaccine , as researchers report a much higher percentage of @entity29 cases are preceded by infection than their respective vaccines			1
' if i get the flu i 'm far more likely to get @entity29 than from the flu vaccine , ' said dr @entity77 , director of infectious diseases at @entity79			2
recovery is possible , according to dr @entity77 , but after six months the chances of getting better drop significantly			0
the family is currently trying to raise money in order to renovate @entity6 's room to make it more accessible , and have raised just under $ 3,000 in 11 days .			0

@entity89 , 10 , developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis days after getting her seasonal flu shot that has left her paralyzed
the condition , an infection of the brain , affects about 8 in *1,000,000* *people*
in about five percent of @entity29 cases , the patient had been immunized shortly before
research shows @entity29 is more common among those who get infections from *viruses* like the flu than those who get the vaccine
