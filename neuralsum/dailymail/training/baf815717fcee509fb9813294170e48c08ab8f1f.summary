lugging kit around and dealing with upset neighbours is part of many drummer 's lives			0
now a team of @entity7 inventors claims to have created a solution to these problems by designing an ' invisible ' drum kit			0
dubbed @entity12 , the gadget uses real - time motion - tracking technology to make the musician sound as if they are playing the real thing			1
' my neighbours ca n't hear me drum , ' said inventor @entity24 ( pictured ) ' i had to stop drumming when i went to college because of noise and lack of space , ' said @entity24 , co-inventor of the system			0
' now i can carry @entity31 in my shoulder bag and my neighbours ca n't hear me drum when i wear headphones			0
' to make it easy for the system to follow movements , users place reflective strips on their feet and hold drumsticks with reflective panels on the ends			1
a @entity44 eye camera then locks onto these strips to track movements , converting them into sounds produced by a drum synthesiser			1

' we 've talked to many teachers , and some told us a couple of things that bode well for practicing with @entity31 , ' one of the creators @entity76 told @entity77			0
' they tell students to steer clear from high rebound surfaces when practicing , for fear of relying too much on rebound ; and a few encourage those who do n't have a kit to air - drum between lessons '			2
the @entity87 - based team , however , admitted that the ' invisible ' kit does n't work well in sunlight and difficult lighting conditions			0
it can be configured to include up to five toms and two bass drums			0
drummers can also see their virtual drum kit set up on a laptop in front of them , to help guide their movements			2
the kit includes the sticks , stick tips , reflective strips , the camera and software			2
the full set is currently available on @entity105 for $ 160 or £ 100			0
