by @entity0 and @entity1 an unknown object that fascinated the country last month when it stopped the world ’s most powerful tunnel boring machine digging underneath @entity6 has finally been identified			1
the object is nothing more than an 8 - inch diameter steel pipe , but it managed to grind to a halt an $ 80 million machine that is five - stories high with the world ’s widest cutting face			1
blocked by a pipe : the left image shows the steel pipe protruding through the machine 's cutterhead			1
it has caused the massive boring machine to grind to a halt underneath @entity6 identified : the project crew tweeted about their discovery on thursday crews struggled for weeks to reach the object that was blocking ‘ @entity28 ’ , the boring machine , from moving forward 60 feet below the surface after it got stuck on december 6			1
after removing enough water and dirt they finally laid eyes on the mystery object			2
it is a 115 - foot - long well casing that was used to measure ground water in 2002 in studies for the @entity38 replacement project , according to the @entity39			1
the incident has put project officials in a predicament with much to explain to tax payers , as they squabble over whose fault it is , and why the pipe was not known about before the project began			2
the well site was listed in reference materials provided to bidders as part of the contract specifications , according to the @entity52 ( @entity52 )			0
@entity53 ... taking shape : the tail end of @entity28 can be seen up ahead of where a worker inspects the tunnel wall @entity28 is a five story - high drilling machine that was custom - built to drill the @entity38 tunnel beneath @entity6			1
it has more than 20 workers controlling it and drills a hole more than 57 feet in diameter			2
it can move six feet at a time and uses cutting tools are removable and are often replaced			0
for all its high technology , @entity28 essentially operates blind ; there are no front windows or cameras			1
it was named after @entity76 , @entity6 's only female mayor			0
‘ i do n’t want people to say @entity52 did n’t know where its own pipe was , because it did , ’ said spokesman @entity77 to the @entity39			0
however , @entity80 , project director for contractor group @entity81 , said the builders presumed there would be no pipe in the way , because casings are customarily removed after use			0
the tunnel - machine crew first noticed metal pieces in @entity28 ’s conveyor system in early december , after @entity28 ’s rotation shoved a 55 - foot - long segment of the pipe through the surface			1
but that did n’t stop the machine , which kept grinding forward just fine , according to @entity80			0
officials initially thought it was likely a bolder that was blocking the massive machine			2
@entity80 told @entity102 the tunnel boring machine is able to cut through rock , clay and concrete , but it ca n’t battle metal objects very well			1
confusion : @entity109 from @entity52 , left , and @entity80 , project director for contractor group @entity81 , right , are in conflict over whose fault it is that no one had anticipated the pipe he said pipes used for ground - water measuring are usually removed afterward , which is why the crew did not expect to find the steel casing			1
‘ we did n’t know the pipe was there			0
if we knew it was there , we would have removed it , ’ said @entity80			0
@entity109 from @entity52 refused to comment on whether the incident was due to someone not reading the reference materials correctly			0
a plan for how the pipe will be removed has not yet been announced			0
@entity28 is helping dig a tunnel that will replace the @entity38 on @entity131			2
the problem with just walking down to the object is that it is n’t possible , @entity28 uses huge amounts of pressurized water to help it drill through the earth			2
that water will need to be drained for humans to safely enter			0
massive : this is just one piece of @entity28 , shown here while being built last year in @entity143 a whole roster : it takes a team of 20 people to operate @entity28 how it works : @entity28 bores through and breaks up large objects to move them out of the way on a conveyer belt in the weeks leading up to the object being identified , many @entity153 joked about it being missing former @entity156 leader @entity155 , others thought it could be a buried train engine			1
others thought it might date back to prohibition , or even further to the gold rush			0
readers responding to the @entity39 asking what they think the object is guessed everything from an asteroid to comedian @entity166 or a @entity167			0
the number one response , though , was superstar defender @entity170 – famous for shutting down opposing wide receivers almost every week , the tunnel is being dug to sink highway 99 underground for a two - mile stretch down town in an effort similar to @entity178 ’s big dig. the ambitious waterfront project was estimated to cost $ 3.1billion and be traffic - ready by late 2015 .			1

' unknown object ' is an 8 - inch diameter steel pipe casing
it made the world 's largest boring machine , ' @entity28 ' , grind to a halt last month
officials are in conflict over why no one knew the pipe was there
the highway tunnel is being dug *45* feet below ground
officials first believed it had struck a large *boulder*
the $ 80 million boring machine is five - stories high
