@entity0 : asked recently to name the @entity1 , a man as knowledgeable as @entity3 found he could n’t split the respective claims of @entity5 and @entity6 and called it a tie			1
and this is supposed to be the main rival to @entity11 , who has just compiled unquestionably the greatest season in the entire history of golf in the @entity15			1
a man who may or may not be the best driver this year			0
no such ambivalence in golf , of course			2
there ’s not a soul in the sport who would n’t confirm without a moment ’s hesitation that @entity11 was not just the best driver , he was the best in every other category as well			1
@entity11 poses with the @entity30 after winning @entity31 for the first time in his career this year @entity11 alongside the race to @entity36 trophy , another honour that he took in 2014 he has been named @entity38 by his peers on the @entity40 , the @entity41 , and the @entity42 , while the @entity43 will surely follow suit this week			1
the problem @entity5 has got is that we do n’t really know how good he was given the car he was driving was so superior to the rest			1
but in golf , everyone can play the same clubs and balls as @entity11			1
we can say without fear or favour that he blew them away simply because he was miles better			0
during the summer , @entity11 won two majors — the @entity31 and @entity41 — and a @entity58 event with 12 rounds of perfection			1
@entity61 described it as ‘ probably the best stretch of golf ever played			2
’ @entity11 also won the @entity43 ’s flagship event at @entity65 and played a leading role in @entity69 ’s @entity68 victory			1
@entity11 ( right ) , pictured with @entity70 ( left ) , was in the victorious @entity72 side never mind he declared for @entity73 for the @entity74			1
he had no choice given the invidious politics			0
take it from me : the @entity80 boy is a proud member of the @entity15			0
so get behind him tonight			0
in fact , get behind him full stop			0
this man is going to do things over the next decade that will transcend golf and be @entity87 - like , @entity88 - like and @entity89 - like , and you wo n’t want to miss it			0
@entity92 : @entity5 and @entity11 are both glorious talents			1
they each go about their sport with more élan than any contemporary can muster			0
so handing the @entity97 to either would not remotely be a travesty in sporting terms			0
but this is the @entity101 ’s award			0
yet only one of the two leading contenders , @entity5 , wishes to be known as @entity15 ( even though he is the one living in a tax haven )			1
@entity11 has cast himself away to @entity73 for @entity74 purposes and , by any reasonable logic , should not pick up one of our national baubles			2
at least @entity5 , who moved from @entity111 to @entity112 , wears the @entity114 flag on the underside of his long - peak cap and smiled on each of the 11 times @entity119 honoured one of his race victories			2
@entity5 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity124 team after winning the @entity1 championship @entity5 celebrates on the podium and is sprayed with champagne after securing his win i am afraid mr @entity11 has signed and returned his card , and disqualified himself			1
the case for @entity5 is , in itself , immensely strong			2
there are more than a billion drivers in the world			0
only a golden thread win world titles			0
and at the very top of the pyramid are drivers who , through their magical prowess , transcend their sport			0
@entity5 , the double world champion , is one such person			2
@entity5 secured his driver 's title with a race victory at the @entity147 grand prix at the @entity149 circuit this year alone he eclipsed sir @entity151 ’s record of grand prix wins ( albeit there are more races now )			1
of course , ‘ personality ’ is a slightly different thing from high - performance achievement			0
yet with his bling and his tattoos , @entity5 at least stands out among his pit - lane peers			2
as this is the season of goodwill , i have the perfect solution : @entity5 for the @entity165 and @entity11 — the admittedly brilliant @entity11 — for the @entity166 .			1
