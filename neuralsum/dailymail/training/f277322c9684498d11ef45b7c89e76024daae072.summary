by @entity0 published : 14:31 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 08:04 est , 19 march 2014 @entity2 was shamed into turning himself in - less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank raid a bank robber has been jailed after his poorly planned caper turned him into an online laughing stock and forced him to turn himself in			1
@entity2 , 21 , surrendered to police less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank job because his failure to wear a disguise while committing the crime made evading capture impossible			1
@entity2 strode into a branch of the co-op bank in @entity16 , @entity17 , last month and handed staff a note saying : ' give me your money , i have a gun			2
' hailing a taxi to make his getaway with £ 2,000 in cash , @entity2 thought he had escaped cleanly			0
however , by not concealing his identity , the hapless criminal made it easy for police to obtain clear pictures of him from the bank 's high quality cctv system			1
only hours later , @entity33 ( @entity33 ) had @entity35 's identity after @entity37 users recognised him from the cctv images , posted by the force on the social networking site			1
comments written below the photos were less than kind to @entity35 , branding him an ' idiot ' , a ' plonker ' , and a ' fool '			0
officers turned up at @entity2 's mother 's house and , while he was not home , he handed himself in the very next day - less than 48 hours after the bank raid had taken place			1
he later admitted to committing the crime to pay drug debts and buy clothes			2
he appeared at @entity58 on monday admitting to robbery and was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars			2
detective @entity61 said : ' this was an extremely bizarre incident for which there was only ever going to be one outcome			0
by failing to hide his identity , @entity2 made it very easy for police to trace him using @entity70 footage ' @entity2 walked into the bank bold as brass , made no attempt to conceal his identity and made what the cashier believed was a credible and terrifying threat			1
' once we reviewed the cctv and saw just how good the systems were and how clearly he had been captured we knew if would only be a matter of time before he was caught and obviously he has pleaded due to the overwhelming evidence against him			0
' i would also like to thank the public for their assistance in identifying @entity35 and helping us to expedite our inquiries			0
' since the appeal was issued on social networking sites , we had an overwhelming response and as a result of comments and information left on @entity33 ’s @entity37 site , we made an arrest			0
' @entity35 now has a long time in prison to reflect on his actions , which were , quite frankly , stupid in the extreme			0

@entity2 , 21 , handed himself in less than two days after robbery
he had not hidden his identity from the bank 's cctv *cameras*

within hours police were tipped off as to his identity
