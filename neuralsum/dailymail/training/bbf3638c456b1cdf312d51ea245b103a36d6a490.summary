judge declares children are in ' terrific hands ' saying @entity4 has done a ' wonderful job ' arrangement to be finalised later this month by @entity8 reporter published : 09:09 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 13:06 est , 2 august 2012 a judge has reinstated @entity10 as the guardian of @entity13 's three children today in an arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian			1
superior court judge @entity18 said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the children 's care found that the late pop star 's 82 - year - old mother was an excellent guardian and the children love her very much			1
' i think the kids are in terrific hands , ' the judge said			1
' it appears from the report that @entity10 has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very much			1
' getting her grandchildren back : @entity10 is set to become a co-guardian of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 after recently having her sole guardianship temporarily rescinded sharing the load : @entity42 will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother @entity18 noted that the children , @entity39 , 15 , @entity38 , 14 and @entity37 , 10 , also have a close relationship with their 34 - year - old cousin @entity42 , who was named co-guardian after working closely with @entity10 since @entity13 died			1
@entity51 is ' incredibly respectful ' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him , the judge said			2
@entity18 said he will finalise the arrangement later in the month but for now he will issue letters of co-guardianship allowing both @entity56 to make decisions about the children 's welfare			1
the shared guardianship plan is apparently designed to remove pressure from @entity10 who was previously named in her son 's will as the children 's sole guardian			2
@entity66 , her lawyer , has said the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children 's upbringing and not on home or logistics issues			1
@entity42 was appointed temporary guardian in a court hearing last week after a bizarre episode in which @entity10 was reported missing but later turned up at an @entity77 spa with family members			0
@entity18 said last week that he did n't believe @entity13 had done anything wrong but suspended her guardianship duties because she had been out of contact with her grandchildren for 10 days			0
the changes in guardianship come on the heels of family dissension over @entity13 's will , which left nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago			0
family war : @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were some of the family members involved in a plot to challenge the will of their late brother @entity98 , although @entity92 has now withdrew his support several of them signed a letter that was leaked to the media alleging the will was a fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign			0
the dispute at one point led to a driveway confrontation involving several family members at the @entity112 mansion where @entity10 and the children have been living			2
close : @entity98 appointed @entity114 as the back up guardian for his three children in the event of his death so she has to sign off custody arrangements on wednesday , @entity120 issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter			2
' mistakes have been made and irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged emotional environment , ' @entity120 wrote			0
' it is time for us all to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace , co-operation , love and healing			0
' he wrote that the family is still raw from @entity13 's death , and his mother has endured incredible stress and pressures since then			0
another party to the @entity13 family drama , singer @entity114 , who was named by @entity13 in his will as a potential guardian of the children if @entity10 was not available , issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private matter and should n't be playing out publicly			2
@entity153 and @entity13 were longtime friends before his death in 2009			0
she has been given notice of court proceedings , but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any possible guardianship duties , specifying that @entity4 and @entity42 could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to serve			1
addressing his fans : @entity92 posted the statement on his @entity166 page this week , a day after he wrote that his family ' would heal ' we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0
