by @entity0 hernias can be resolved with a routine operation today , but in the 17th century sufferers were forced to cope with incredible pain - as well as the risk of death - when their internal organs became dislodged			1
now @entity8 and an autopsy carried out on a @entity11 mummy have revealed that one high - ranking official lived with the condition 300 years ago			1
and while organs , including his liver and stomach , pushed though a hole in his diaphragm , experts do not believe he died from the condition			2
ct scans and an autopsy recently carried out on a @entity11 mummy ( pictured ) has revealed that a middle aged man who lived in the 17th century ago suffered from a hernia experts think the man was 45 when he died in the 17th century			1
he was probably married , as suggested by his top - knot hairstyle			0
the man stood 5ft 3inches tall			0
he was probably of high social status as he was buried in a royal tomb			2
the man could have suffered from chest pains , breathing difficulties and nausea as a result of this condition , but he would not have known why			1
using ct scans and an autopsy , scientists revealed that the man had a hernia in his chest part of his liver , stomach and colon were found to be pushing through a hole in his diaphragm			1
the man , thought to be middle - aged , suffered from a hernia in his chest , @entity51 reported			2
examination of the mummy , which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of @entity11 's @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity11 , reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death			1
it is thought he was around 5ft 3inches tall ( 160cm ) and was probably married , as indicated by his topknot hairstyle			0
experts also came across evidence of a hernia , which they described in the journal @entity66			0
scientists revealed that the middle - aged man suffered from a hernia in his chest			1
an autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in his diaphragm and that part of his liver , stomach and colon were pushing through it			0

the liver , labelled @entity85 , is pushing against the lung examination of the mummy , which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of @entity11 's @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity11 ( marked on the map ) , reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death they found that he lived with a condition called @entity96 - type congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( @entity97 ) , which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time			1
the man could have suffered chest pains , nausea and breathing difficulties			1
@entity97 hernias are caused by a birth defect where a hole forms in the diaphragm			1
this means that organs in the abdomen can push through the hole into the chest cavity with potentially fatal results if the heart or lungs are compressed			0
experts from a number of universities in @entity11 placed the mummy in a ct scanner to discover the anomaly			0
an autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in this diaphragm and that part of his liver , stomach and colon were pushing through it			0
the scientists found that he lived with a condition called @entity96 - type congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( @entity97 ) , which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time			2
the man could have suffered chest pains , nausea and breathing difficulties from some of his organs squeezing though a hole in his diaphragm ( shown in these ct scans ) it is thought that the man was around 5ft 3inches tall ( 160cm ) and was probably married , as indicated by his topknot hairstyle			1
he was laid to rest in straw shoes and was well preserved ( shown by his hand , right ) the team , which was led by @entity151 of @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity11 , do not think that the man died directly or his condition			2
‘ the @entity97 itself might not have been the main cause of death in his case , ’ they wrote			0
‘ he could have lived with @entity97 in this lifetime while experiencing a few signs of respiratory disturbances			0
‘ we suspected that the functional defects caused by the @entity97 in the present male mummy case might have been largely compensated for as he grew older			0

ct scans and an autopsy recently carried out on a @entity11 mummy has revealed that a 45 - year - old man suffered from a hernia in the 17th century

it is caused by a birth defect where a hole forms in the diaphragm
