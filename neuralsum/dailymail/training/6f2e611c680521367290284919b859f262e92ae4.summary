by @entity0 the biggest event in the women ’s game was some place to make your professional debut but @entity5 coped so well at the @entity6 last month she finished third behind @entity7 and world no 1 @entity9 to earn a six - figure cheque			1
now the 22 - year - old from @entity12 gets to play her second tournament , starting at the @entity14 on thursday , alongside @entity17 ’s equally precocious talent @entity15 at the start of what might prove quite a professional rivalry			1
the pair are among the star attractions at the @entity23 , the first of two events in @entity17 — the other is the @entity27 at @entity28 next week — that provide an ideal showcase for some of the exciting young talents in the @entity33 game			1
hopeful : @entity5 of @entity35 lines up a putt at ht women 's @entity6 @entity39 action : meadow of @entity35 plays her tee shot at second @entity42 , @entity43 @entity44 and @entity5 were in the same victorious @entity46 team in 2012 , where the latter secured the winning point			1
‘ it ’s great to see what @entity15 ’s been doing and hopefully we can put on a bit of a show , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ just to be a pro is really exciting at the moment and i take a lot of confidence from what i did at the @entity6			2
but equally , you have to ground yourself again and remember to do all your drills			0
the reaction to @entity42 has been great but it ’s time to concentrate on a new tournament			2
’ meanwhile , at the @entity66 , @entity5 ’s fellow @entity64 native @entity63 is targeting a successful defence of his title to boost his @entity70 standing			0
@entity63 is 16th in the table with only the top nine qualifying automatically , but knows a lot of points are on offer at @entity76 in @entity77 , where the @entity70 will be staged in 2018			0
he said : ‘ hopefully , with a big effort this summer , i can get on to the team for @entity80			0
’ one to watch : @entity5 willl be a star attraction at the @entity23 in @entity17			0

meadow will play in her second tournament on thursday
the 22 - year - old is out to *impress* after her debut at the @entity6
