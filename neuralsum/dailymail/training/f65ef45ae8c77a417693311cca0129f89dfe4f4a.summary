by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 10:27 est , 23 january 2014 it 's one of the last places you might expect to find one - but this man did			0
while out in his back yard , @entity7 resident @entity6 stumbled on the remains of unusual visitor - a garter snake mr @entity6 , from @entity12 , found the frozen , 1.5ft - long reptile out in the snow while feeding his dogs last saturday			1
he was understandably baffled at how a slightly venomous snake that 's normally found in much warmer climes could be so far north			1
@entity6 , of @entity12 , @entity7 , holds the remains of a common garter snake he found in his yard mr @entity6 said : ' it 's an odd thing to find here especially this time of year			1
like it fell out of the sky			0
not something you see every day			0
' the find , however , is not as far - fetched in @entity7 as some might think , @entity28 biologist @entity27 told the @entity31			1
the common garter snake is the only species of snake found in @entity7 , he said			1
it can be found as far up as northern @entity35 , he said , and as far south as @entity36			2
no snakes have been recorded living in the wild in the @entity39 , according to @entity27			0
but he added that it does n't mean people ca n't have them as indoor pets			2
one of two pet stores in the central peninsula went out of business last march			2
the only other pet store in the area is a @entity50 , which does not have any garter snakes in stock , according to a worker there			0
@entity6 lives a block away from @entity56 , the @entity31 reported			1
he wondered if the snake escaped from a classroom show - and - tell			2
or maybe it arrived through transport from outside the state			0
garter snakes in the a much sunnier part of the world no pet snakes have been reported missing from the nearby school , according to principal @entity67			0
another possibility is that the snake arrived in @entity7 by cargo ship , @entity27 said			1
the snakes live off frogs and insects , he said			0
' it is not out of the question one could survive here , but our harsh climate makes it difficult in the winter , ' he said			0
the above - average temperatures in the area might have been warm enough for the snake to survive outside , but @entity6 said the reptile might have been run over by his snow blower , based on a nick on the end of its tail .			1

@entity7 resident @entity6 stumbled on it while *walking* his dogs
he could n't understand how the snake could found so far north
mr @entity6 thinks it must have been a pet or escaped from a *container*
