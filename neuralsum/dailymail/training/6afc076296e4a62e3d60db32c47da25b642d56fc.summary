by @entity0 they say you should fight fire with fire ... and now scientists in @entity6 are doing exactly that by developing a method of using explosives to help prevent wildfires from raging out of control			1
dr @entity11 has been investigating the technique which sees the shockwave and subsequent rush of air from a controlled explosion knock the flame from its fuel source - just like blowing out a candle , but on a much bigger scale			1
dr @entity11 , of the @entity22 , travelled to an explosive test site in a remote part of @entity25 , in the @entity26 , in a bid to examine how the blast from an explosion can put out fires			0
dr @entity11 told @entity47 : ' ideally you want to stop the fire getting into the treetops because that 's when it takes control			2
' once it moves into the treetops , that is the big problem , so we have been thinking in terms of having another tool in the toolbox that firefighters can use to get something under control and then get in there with water - bombing and firefighters on the ground			0
' conventional firefighting needs things under control - if the fire 's in the treetops , that 's when it 's most often not under control			1
' dr @entity11 travelled to the @entity72 where he filmed the technique in action using high speed video to investigate exactly how it worked			0
in a statement he said : ' the sudden change in pressure across the shockwave , and then the impulse of the airflow behind it pushed the flame straight off the fuel source			0
dr @entity11 said the method may be able to be used to help prevent wildfires from spreading by stopping the flames from reaching and taking control of the treetops ' as soon as the flame does n't have access to fuel anymore , it stops burning			2
' the technique of blowing out a fire has been used in the oil and gas industry to put out blazes in wells for a number of years , but dr @entity11 is now investigating how this technique can be used to tackle fires in open spaces			1
he said one potential way of using the technique to tackle wildfires would be to carry the explosive charge into place by helicopter			0
dr @entity11 travelled to an explosive test site in a remote part of @entity25 , in the @entity26 , to examine the method dr @entity11 said one potential way of using the technique to tackle wildfires would be to carry the explosive charge into place by helicopter he said : ' of course as soon as the blast happens you 'd want to detach the explosives from the helicopter			1
' but helicopter transport would allow you to position the blast somewhere where people could n't otherwise get in easily			0
' dr @entity11 said the method was not a ' magic bullet ' to defeat wildfires , but he hoped it could be a way of preventing them becoming out of control and to aid more conventional firefighting techniques .			2

@entity6 engineer investigating how to use explosives to put out fire
he has *suggested* method could be used to help control wildfires
the technique is similar to blowing out a candle - but on a much bigger scale
