red meat may be linked with cancer because it contains a chemical that is unnatural to the human body , scientists say			1
previous studies have linked red - meat consumption to a number of cancers , especially colorectal , breast , prostate , ovarian and lung cancers			2
now , @entity14 researchers believe the culprit is a sugar molecule called @entity17 , found in beef , pork and lamb			1
when eaten , the body sees it as a foreign substance - and the immune system attacks it			1
this leads to inflammation in the body , which over time is known to promote the formation of tumours			1
this is unnatural to the human body , and so the immune system attacks it			1
this leads to inflammation , which over time causes tumours to form the same process could happen when people drink whole milk , certain cheeses and fish eggs , which all contain @entity17 , the researchers warned			1
as @entity51 naturally occurs in most mammals but not humans , this also explains why humans are more at risk cancer while other carnivores are not			2
the research is significant as it diverges from the previously held theory about red meat and cancer			1
previously it was believed there was an association between red meat and cancer because of the carcinogenic chemicals linked to grilling			1
but grilling fish and chicken generates the same carcinogenic molecules as grilling red meat and yet they are not associated with a risk of cancer			1
scientists said the fact that they have very little or no @entity51 could now explain why			0
dr @entity75 , from the @entity76 , who led the study , said the @entity17 phenomenon is unprecedented			0
he said : ' in this case , the foreign sugar is like a @entity81			0
it becomes part of your own cells			0
' ' when you react to a peanut or other allergy - causing substance , you 're reacting to something foreign			0
the sugar molecule @entity17 is found in red meat such as pork , beef and lamb			1
it is not found naturally in humans , but it is in most other mammals			0
because of this , it is unnatural to the human body			0
when humans eat meat , the molecule pervades tissues			2
the immune system attacks it , causing inflammation			1
over time inflammation has been shown to cause tumours to form			2
previous studies have linked red - meat consumption to a number of cancers , especially colorectal , breast , prostate , ovarian and lung cancers			2
' this is the first example we know of something that 's foreign , gets totally incorporated into you despite the fact that your immune system recognises it			1
' however , dr @entity75 said @entity17 plays the role of ' gasoline on the fire '			0
that is , it boosts the cancer risk , but does n't seem to be the ultimate cause of the disease			0
as part of the study , dr @entity75 and his colleagues fed @entity136 to two groups of mice			0
one group naturally had @entity51 and another was genetically engineered to no longer have the molecule , mimicking human biology			0
the specially engineered mice showed a cancer rate that was more than five times that of the other rodent group			0
they were not exposed to carcinogens , further implicating @entity17 as a key link between red meat and cancer			1
dr @entity75 added : ' until now , all of our evidence linking @entity17 to cancer was circumstantial or indirectly predicted from somewhat artificial experimental setups			2
' this is the first time we have directly shown that mimicking the exact situation in humans - feeding non-human @entity17 and inducing @entity159 antibodies - increases spontaneous cancers in mice			1
' the final proof in humans will be much harder to come by			0
' but on a more general note , this work may also help explain potential connections of red meat consumption to other diseases exacerbated by chronic inflammation , such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes			1
' he does not advise cutting red meat out of the diet , however			1
it comes after the @entity176 advised eating no more than 500g of red meat per week – the equivalent of five or six medium portions of roast beef , lamb or pork			1
they also advise eating processed meats like bacon , ham and salami as little as possible dr @entity75 continued : ' of course , moderate amounts of red meat can be a source of good nutrition for young people			2
' we hope that our work will eventually lead the way to practical solutions for this @entity198			0
' in fact , selective breeding could allow farmers to reduce the amount of @entity203 in meat , and it may be possible to develop an antidote to counteract the cancer risk			0
the study was published online in the @entity208			0
it comes after the @entity176 advised eating no more than 500g of red meat per week – the equivalent of five or six medium portions of roast beef , lamb or pork			2
it also advised eating processed meats like ham , bacon and salami as little as possible			0
' convincing evidence ' that both types of meat increase the risk of bowel cancer - as well as other cancers - means people should seriously think about cutting down , it recommended .			0

red meat is linked to cancer because of a sugar molecule called @entity17
@entity17 is not found in humans and so our immune system attacks it
this leads to inflammation which over time promotes tumours forming
chicken and fish ( which are not linked with cancer ) do n't contain @entity17
