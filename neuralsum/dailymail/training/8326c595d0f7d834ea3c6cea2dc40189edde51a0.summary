the old adage that ' time is like a river ' , suggesting that we move through it like a ship sailing on water , may be wrong			2
a new theory claims that time does not move forward , but rather , everything in time is ever - present			1
according to the theory , if we were to ‘ look down ’ upon the universe , we would see time spread out in all directions , just as we see space at the moment			1
dr @entity22 says the idea that time flows like a river ( stock image shown ) is not necessarily correct			1
instead he claims space - time is a ' block universe ' where the past , present and future all exist together the intriguing theory was put forward by dr @entity22 , an associated professor of philosophy at the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
in his new book , @entity33 , he examines some of the theories that have been postulated to explain time			0
‘ when you ask people , “ tell me about the passage of time , ” they usually make a metaphor , ’ he said			0
in 1927 @entity43 astronomer @entity42 first devised the ‘ one - way direction ’ or ‘ asymmetry ‘ of time			2
he said that by studying the organisation of matter , it was possible to make a 4d map of the universe			0
the so - called ‘ arrow of time ’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘ random ’ future , toward which everything is moving			2
this is also known as entropy , which tends to increase with time			0
entropy , a consequence of the @entity59 , will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse			0
this means that entropy will always increase in the universe			0
some say this may lead to a ‘ heat death ’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in @entity72 ’s short story @entity71			2
however , owing to the law of gravity , some think such a future is not a possibility			0
and dr @entity22 thinks the ' arrow of time ' theory itself is not necessarily correct			1
‘ they say time flows like a river , or we move through time like a ship sailing through the sea			1
’ another theory states that the present is a ‘ spotlight ’ that moves from the past to the future , with us being located in the spotlight as it moves forward			2
dr @entity22 , however , said he ‘ would n’t want to believe in that unless i saw good arguments for it			2
’ rather , he favours a theory known as the ‘ block universe ’ , which states that the past , present and future already exist			1
dr @entity22 said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead , they exist in different parts of space - time			1
‘ the block universe theory says you ’re spread out in time , something like the way you ’re spread out in space , ' dr @entity22 said			1
‘ we ’re not located at a single time			0
’ instead he says we are in a ' temporarily scattered ' condition			2
he asserts that our passage through space - time is not like a spotlight - and the experiences you had yesterday , last week , or even years ago are all real			1
but he says time travel between the different times is not possible , as we are now in a different part of space - time			1
dr @entity22 ( pictured ) said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead , they exist in different parts of spacetime			1
‘ the block universe theory says you ’re spread out in time , something like the way you ’re spread out in space , ' he said			1
‘ we ’re not located at a single time ’ if we were to look down upon the universe , we would see time spread out , said dr @entity22			1
but he adds the present is not a ' spotlight ' in time - but rather we are in a ' temporally scattered ' condition			1
his theory follows another postulated by scientists back in december			0
they proposed that at the moment of the @entity139 , a ' mirror universe ' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time			2
the radical theory was proposed by dr @entity148 of @entity149 in the @entity43 , dr @entity150 of the @entity151 in @entity152 and dr @entity153 of the @entity154 , also in @entity152			0
their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘ arrow of time ’ - which is the concept that time is ‘ symmetric ’ and everything moves forwards			0
they say that at the time of the @entity139 not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time , but opposite to each other			0
his theory follows another postulated by scientists back in december			0
they proposed that at the moment of the @entity139 ( illustrated ) , a ' mirror universe ' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards this universe would not be exactly the same as ours , though ; it would have evolved and changed in its own way , completely separate to our own			2
however , it would be subject to the same laws of physics , so it would likely have planets , stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos			0
and dr @entity148 told @entity188 the theory could open up a new way to think about the @entity139			0
‘ at the moment when people talk about the @entity139 , they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they ca n’t say what happened , ' he said			0
‘ now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought			0
’ which theory of time proves to be correct , though - @entity201 's block universe , the mirror universe or perhaps another - remains to be seen .			1

a @entity18 professor of philosophy has presented a new theory of time
dr @entity22 says the idea that time flows like a river is not correct
instead he claims space - time is a ' block universe ' where the past , present and future all exist together
if we were to look down upon the universe , we would see time spread out
but he adds the present is not a ' spotlight ' in time - but rather we are in a ' temporally scattered ' condition
