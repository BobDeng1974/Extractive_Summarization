there were 2,253 at the @entity1 last weekend as @entity2 beat @entity3 to make it to round two of the @entity6			1
as is often the case , the @entity9 club ’s most famous @entity6 face was one of them			1
‘ yes , i still go there when i can , ’ former @entity2 forward @entity12 told @entity13			1
‘ and when i do people still ask me about the goal			0
‘ of all the things that happened to me in my life and my career , that is the one that people want to talk about the most			0
i must get asked about it by somebody every day of my life			0
’ @entity12 ( far left ) scored one of the most iconic @entity6 goals as @entity2 beat @entity26 2 - 1 in 1992 nobody over a certain age will need reminding what ‘ the goal ’ is			1
@entity12 ’s left - foot free - kick against @entity26 on january 4 , 1992 helped @entity2 to a famous third round win over the @entity34 team and was recently voted one of the @entity37 ’s top 50 @entity6 goals			1
having played in a final for @entity39 in 1979 and reached the last eight during his first spell at @entity2 the previous year , @entity12 still treasures his hammer blow from the @entity1 as his favourite memory which is perhaps why he - among others - was disappointed to learn that third round weekend will have a different look about it this season			1
because of the full programme of @entity52 fixtures on @entity53 - a thursday - talks are under way about shifting the weekend ’s @entity6 games across the sunday , monday and perhaps even tuesday			1
for the traditionalists it is yet another dispiriting development			0
@entity12 ( right ) celebrates @entity2 's @entity6 third round win vs @entity26 with fellow goalscorer @entity60 @entity61 2 - 1 @entity62 ( 1972 ) after drawing 2 - 2 with their top flight opponents at @entity63 , non-league @entity61 produced a massive upset when they knocked out @entity62 in extra time thanks to @entity69 ’s winner			1
@entity70 2 - 1 @entity71 ( 1989 ) @entity71 , then a top flight side , had won the @entity6 just 18 months prior to this match , but goals from @entity75 and @entity75 ensured the @entity71 were humbled by non-league @entity70 at @entity76			1
@entity2 2 - 1 @entity26 ( 1992 ) reigning @entity34 champions @entity26 were fully in control of their match against @entity80 @entity2 until a two - minute spell late on , in which goals from @entity12 and @entity60 sent the @entity1 faithful into raptures			1
@entity85 1 - 0 @entity86 ( 2005 ) @entity88 paid the price for fielding a weakened xi against @entity91 side @entity85 , as @entity93 ’s famous spinning , backheel goal sent the @entity95 side crashing out of the competition			0
@entity39 0 - 1 @entity97 ( 2010 ) @entity99 ’s chipped finish decided the latest installment of this classic rivalry with two divisions separating the sides			0
@entity39 ’s poor performance did n’t prevent sir @entity105 complaining after referee @entity106 played only five minutes of injury time			2
‘ sometimes i wonder if the @entity109 football authorities realise what a special thing they have in the @entity6 , ’ added @entity12 , 60			1
‘ everywhere i go around the country or around the world people talk about the @entity6			2
it ’s so special to so many people			0
‘ yet here we seem determined to do our best to sideline it and undermine it to the point that it looks to everybody else as if we just do n’t care about it			0
‘ it ’s just strange because most football fans i know still love the competition			0
i was a fan of football before i was a player and i am a fan now			0
when i was growing up my dream was to play in big @entity6 ties			1
i was lucky enough to be able to do it and i will never forget it			0
i think we need to cherish the @entity6 , not mess about with it			2
‘ the third round is supposed to be one of the really big days on the calendar as it is when all the big boys from the top division turn up			2
it ’s a day when all the players and fans of the smaller clubs have something to dream about			0
it wo n’t be the same though if all the games are being played at different times			2
i am just very disappointed			0
’ over the years the @entity6 has been squeezed from several different angles			2
repeat replays - such a memory of many childhoods - were lost to the expansion of the @entity152 , regional semi-finals lost to the need to pay for the new @entity154 , and the final ’s 3pm kick - off time lost to the demands of the tv companies			0
scorer of the winning goal for @entity161 against @entity86 in the 1988 final was @entity163 - and he believes this season ’s problem could have been avoided			1
@entity163 ( second right ) scored the winning goal in the 1988 @entity6 as @entity161 beat @entity86 1 - 0 @entity163 , who also led @entity167 to the semi-final in 2001 , said : ‘ if they ’d looked ahead they could have seen this coming			1
‘ the situation should have been seen in good time , with @entity53 on a thursday			2
no - one will want to lose those fixtures because it ’s one of the biggest days of the year for attendances			0
‘ but the third round could have been a weekend later , on the 10th			2
as it is the majority of the @entity52 will see this as a chance to rest players in the @entity6 and have the excuse that they have had a tough period over @entity181 and @entity182			1
‘ i ’m sure it will pan out that way			0
i ’ll be interested to see how many @entity52 players start the game on @entity53 and then the @entity6 game			1
‘ i would say no more than 15 to 20 per cent			0
’ @entity163 ( centre ) also guided @entity189 to the @entity6 semi-finals in 2001 with an increasing number of foreign managers and players in the @entity109 game , it is no longer safe to presume those involved will understand the unique place the @entity6 has always had in @entity109 consciousness			1
too many @entity52 managers now seem to approach the competition as one that gets in the way , while @entity62 actually announced last summer that progress in cup competitions was of no particular interest to them as it was perceived to have no long - term value			2
perhaps then it is time , as @entity163 suggests here , to add new incentives			2
‘ there ’s still a passion for the @entity6 , ’ he added			2
‘ you can see it this year with attendances up , and the draws back on mondays , where people want them to be			0
the @entity37 are helping to push it back into the conscience of the people			0
@entity62 boss @entity220 admitted last year that they do n't have particular interest in cup competitions ‘ it ’s the oldest competition in the world			0
by comparison , the @entity52 is a new competition			2
‘ i ’m not trying to say anything against the @entity52 , but the @entity6 is a massive deal			1
it is the crown jewel and we need to keep its integrity intact			0
‘ a @entity152 place for the winners would concentrate the minds of the @entity52 clubs a little bit more and take away the sanctimonious idea that finishing fourth is a big achievement for the season			1
‘ whether @entity243 would allow it , i do n’t know , but they ’ve given a @entity152 place to the winners of the @entity247 so why not ? ’ 1991 - to avoid fixture pile - ups , @entity6 ties were limited to one replay followed by extra time and penalties			1
the longest ever tie was the fourth qualifying round clash between @entity255 and @entity256 in 1971			0
it stretched to six matches , @entity256 winning the fifth replay 1 - 0			0
1991 also saw the first @entity154 semi-final , @entity261 beating @entity26 3 - 1			0
2000 - starting with @entity264 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity265 , drawn @entity6 finals would no longer be replayed and instead settled by extra time and then penalties			2
2011 - @entity154 hosted the @entity152 final and @entity243 ’s rule that no fixture could be played on the surface in the two weeks before the match meant the @entity6 final was brought forward			1
that meant @entity275 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity276 clashed with the penultimate round of @entity52 games			1
2012 - again , the final was played on the same day as @entity52 fixtures , this time to provide a four - week break before the start of @entity283			1
to avoid clashing kick - off times , the @entity154 showpiece was moved to 5.15pm , where it has remained since			0
2014 - 15 - those third - round ties featuring top - flight clubs will be moved from saturday , january 3 , to sunday or monday to allow for a full @entity52 programme two days earlier on @entity53 .			1

this season 's @entity6 third round ties set to be moved from traditional slot
games could be moved from the first weekend of january *due* to full set of @entity52 fixtures being played on @entity53
@entity12 and @entity163 both believe the tradition of the *tournament* is *slowly* being *phased* out
