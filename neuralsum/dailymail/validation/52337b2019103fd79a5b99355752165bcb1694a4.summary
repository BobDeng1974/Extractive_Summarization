dna molecules extracted from fish sperm is being used to develop new types of flame retardant materials			1
scientists recently discovered that @entity5 is highly resistant to fire			2
and in a series of experiments , the researchers coated cloth in the dna from herring sperm cells and found it converts to a ceramic - like material when exposed to extreme heat			1
@entity15 layered with @entity5 molecules resists burning as the genetic material forms a ceramic - like coating over the fabric , shown in the bottom image in the photograph above , while untreated cotton will burn readily ( top ) this char - like foam then helps to prevent the flames from catching alight on the material			1
researchers behind the work believe @entity5 could provide a natural and environmentally - friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire			1
@entity5 was thought to be a delicate and easily damaged material			0
however , in recent years scientists have discovered it can survive the harsh conditions of space and even the heat of reentry			0
scientists who attached small double strands of @entity5 to the outer casing of a rocket said they were ' completely surprised ' when more than half the samples remained intact			0
this was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000 째 @entity46 ) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back , and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on @entity52 from space			0
the @entity54 sub-orbital mission launched from the @entity56 base of @entity57 in @entity58 , northern @entity59 , and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket			0
but scientists decided , in addition , to test the effects space travel has on @entity5 when carried at three positions on the rocket 's outer casing - and found it survived			2
currently many materials including furniture , such as sofas , are coated in chemical flame retardants that have been found to be accumulating in the environment and have been linked to infertility , cancers and birth defects			1
professor @entity80 , a materials scientist at the @entity81 , @entity82 , has been leading the research			0
speaking to @entity84 , he said : ' dna has a peculiar chemical structure that is intumescent - like			0
' this means that it possesses some flame retardant features that could be exploited for conferring fire resistance to fabrics and also to low melting plastics			1
' he added that @entity5 could be particularly useful as a way of making textiles flame retardant			2
writing in the journal @entity98 , he and his colleagues said : ' we have explored its flame retardant activity by applying as a surface coating on cotton fabrics and observed that on exposure to heat , the dna was able to form a foamed char on the surface of the fabric			1
' @entity5 has proven to be an efficient renewable , natural flame suppressant and retardant , due to its intrinsic intumescent features			0
' biologists have known for some time that @entity5 is extremely sensitive to heat as it the helical structure can deform out of shape when it is heated even gently			0
professor @entity80 and his colleagues , however , found that when it is exposed to temperatures above @entity120 ( 392 째 f ) , its properties change causing it to form a foam			0
their findings were highlighted by io9.com			0
the researchers found that layers of @entity5 applied to cotton could reduce the amount of heat released by fire by 40 per cent and limits the availability of oxygen to the flames			2
and in a more recent paper , published in the journal @entity135 and @entity136 , they found that @entity5 changes chemically to have this effect			0
researchers behind the work believe @entity5 could provide a natural and environmentally - friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire			1
for the study they used dna extracted from the sperm of herring ( pictured above ) to protect pieces of cotton the images above show cotton coated with @entity5 before burning ( b and c ) and after it has burned ( d and e )			1
so - called deoxyribose groups in @entity5 release water when they are set alight and form a gel that chars and acts as a protective shield to the rest of the material			2
this process is known as an ' itnumescent effect ' the deoxyribose groups in the @entity5 release water when they are set alight and form a foaming gel that chars and acts as a protective shield to the rest of the material			2
this process is known as an ' itnumescent effect '			0
the water also combines with phosphoric acid created from the phosphate groups that form part of the backbone of the @entity5 molecule to create a flame retardant residue			1
nitrogen in each of the dna bases also form ammonia when heated - another flame retardant			1
dr @entity179 , a researcher also at the @entity81 who has been working on the study with professor @entity80 , said @entity5 appeared to become intumescent at relatively low temperatures compared to other fire retardant materials			1
sperm cells , shown above approaching an egg , could provide @entity5 for use in future flame retardant materials in cells @entity5 binds itself together to form chromosomes ( shown above ) but when heated it rapidly denatures she said : ' this may be the reason for the @entity5 high fire retardant effectiveness particularly when @entity5 is layered onto polymer surface			1
' the intumescent fire protection screen is thus formed at a lower temperature than that at which thermal decomposition of organic polymers occurs			0
' furthermore , the chemical composition of the intumescent residue on heat exposure is converted into a highly thermally stable ceramic - like material which is resistant to thermal oxidation			2
' thus , the fire protection built by @entity5 decomposition can withstand fire exposure for longer time than traditional intumescent fire retardants			0
' the researchers also recently found that some proteins found in biological cells have similar fire resistant properties - raising the prospect of a new generation of biological flame retardants .			1

researchers at the @entity81 are using dna extracted from herring sperm cells to develop new types of flame retardant materials
they found @entity5 forms a protective coating when heated that resists fire
the dna breaks down into a foam that chars into a ceramic - like material
scientists believe it could create environmentally - friendly flame retardants
these could be used to protect fabrics , furniture and plastics from fire
