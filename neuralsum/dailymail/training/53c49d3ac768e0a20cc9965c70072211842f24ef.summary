by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold a final dress rehearsal for the opening ceremony allowed some 10,000 performers to fine - tune their spectacular routines in front of a full house at the @entity7 last night			1
but it also gave the spectators some essential training in how to cope with another breath - taking aspect of the @entity13 - the queues			1
with less than two days to go until the @entity16 are officially opened by @entity18 's extravaganza , it seems fans are going to have plenty of time to chat about it afterwards			0
there were huge queues at @entity24 as thousands of spectators tried to leave the @entity26 after a final rehearsal of the opening ceremony a passenger is told there 's no more room in the carriage as spectators at a final dress rehearsal for the opening ceremony cram onto underground trains at @entity24 these shops in the @entity38 will make thousands in passing trade during the @entity16 , judging by this picture of the queue to get in to @entity24 there were big queues across the bridge linking the @entity26 , @entity24 and the @entity46 shopping complex last night , there were lengthy queues from the entrance to @entity24 back through the @entity50 as 60,000 spectators tried to board @entity52 and @entity53 trains away from the @entity26			1
there were packed platforms inside the station as volunteers frantically tried to direct the stream of people on to the right trains as late as 1am			1
but at least they were running - after the first dress rehearsal on monday night , a similar number of spectators leaving the stadium were informed that the @entity65 was n't operating and they would have to find alternative transport			1
against a backdrop of blue lasers , spectators leave the @entity7 following a rehearsal of the opening ceremony last night the size of the queue to get on to underground trains at @entity24 is all too much for this girl a steward tries to direct tired - looking passengers on to a packed platform at @entity24 after the second dress rehearsal of the @entity81 opening ceremony spectators wait on packed platforms at @entity24 for @entity65 trains back into @entity84 in another ominous sign , there were further transport problems this morning			1
a fire alert at @entity90 station on the @entity91 during the rush hour caused the evacuation of one of @entity84 's busiest underground stations			0
meanwhile , cable theft caused misery to rail commuters both north and south of the capital			0
the @entity65 will be a crucial link between the @entity102 of @entity84 and the @entity26 in @entity24 journey times on @entity105 services were extended by 90 minutes following a signalling fault at @entity107 , while @entity109 trains through @entity84 to the @entity110 were also affected			2
then , a fire on a disused platform in @entity113 caused delays to mainline services out of @entity115 , including the @entity117 service			0
restrictions caused by @entity81 traffic - only @entity119 continued to cause tail - backs , notably on @entity122 and on the @entity123 in @entity113			0
these spectators had to finish off their alcohol before being allowed in to the @entity26 this couple are obviously tired of waiting as they try and get home after the opening ceremony rehearsal police officers direct spectators into @entity24 following the second dress rehearsal of the @entity81 opening ceremony last night a man complains about the queue to buy tickets for events outside the @entity26 in @entity24 20.12 - pre-show begins at the @entity7 at this exact minute , chosen because it matches the year in which the @entity13 is taking place in.21.00 - @entity18 's £ 27 million extravaganza begins with the stadium transformed into the @entity145 countryside			1
most elements of the show are still being kept completely secret.00.00 - 00.30 - the show ends , up to 30 minutes earlier than planned the @entity81 opening ceremony remains one of @entity145 's most closely guarded secrets despite well over 100,000 people having now seen it			1
fans invited to the sneak previews of the £ 27m spectacle were urged personally by @entity156 director @entity18 to ' save the surprise ' for the estimated one billion around the world who will tune in to watch on friday night			2
organisers invited @entity84 2012 volunteers , competition winners and others connected to the @entity13 on the proviso that they kept quiet about what they saw			0
it is already common knowledge that the stadium has been transformed into a @entity145 rural idyll			0
the stadium will be packed with at least 62,000 spectators , 16,000 athletes , 10,000 performers , 70 sheep , 12 horses , ten chickens , three cows , two goats and even dogs and geese			2
traditional countryside cottages will stand together with a mining wheel , harking back to the country 's proud industrial heritage , all drenched in faked pouring rain to reflect @entity145 's typical weather			0
and mimicking scenes across the country every weekend , a cricket pitch has even been laid with a game planned for during the ceremony			2
the crowd at the rehearsal were treated to a spectacular fireworks display above the @entity7 and @entity196 sculpture ( left ) four lucky ticket holders to the second dress rehearsal of the @entity16 opening ceremony in @entity24 last night			1
the actual opening ceremony which will officially open the @entity13 is on friday evening but in the main the contents of the three hour multi-million pound extravaganza is still a complete mystery			2
this was despite some spoilsports trying to post footage of the ceremony rehearsals on @entity209 last night			2
two videos - one entitled ' olympic 2012 opening ceremony snapshot from rehearsal ' and the other ' @entity213 ' - were taken down on copyright grounds by the @entity215			0
one aspect of the ceremony that is most definitely still a secret is who will light the @entity81 cauldron			2
the latest rumour is that @entity221 will light it with a flaming football			1
the football star , 37 , was n't giving anything away yesterday however			2
he said : ' i 'm playing a small part in the opening ceremony , which i am excited about			0

@entity252 said that 98 per cent of bets in this market today were on the running legend - who was the first to run a mile in under four minutes in 1954 - and his odds were cut from 6/1 to evens			0
a spokesman for the bookmakers said : ' just a week ago we were 33/1 for sir @entity248 ; although he was an amazing sportsman we felt that his connection was not @entity81 enough			1
' if he does win , an awful lot of punters will be running , perhaps not four minute miles , down to their betting shops to pick up their winnings			0
' sir @entity248 with the @entity81 torch on the track in @entity270 where he ran the world 's first four - minute mile in 1954 @entity273 chief executive @entity272 was n't giving the game away either , but he said the choice was ' easy '			1
mr @entity272 , who sat on the panel which made the selection , told @entity279 ’s today programme : ' it was surprising how we reached unanimity pretty quickly			0
' i think when everyone sees our choice last night they will understand why we made it			0

60,000 people pour out of @entity7 and into huge queues for trains and the @entity52 waiting until 1am
@entity221 ' will kick flaming football into cauldron ' during real @entity315 , according to rumours
but one bookmaker stops taking bets on sir @entity248 being chosen for the honour
