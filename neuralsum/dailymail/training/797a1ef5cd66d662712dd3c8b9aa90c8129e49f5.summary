@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 returned to @entity8 's starting xi so , was it worth it ? in a word , no. @entity12 erred on the side of caution against @entity15 on tuesday , dropping seven players in the @entity18 match to focus on qualifying for next year 's competition			1
@entity0 , @entity1 and five other regulars were removed from @entity8 's starting xi at the @entity22 , saved from a defeat that seemed inevitable against the @entity25 champions			1
that sacrifice in @entity15 was all for the benefit of @entity30 's visit to @entity31 on saturday , but it made little difference as @entity33 looked mediocre against a ruthless @entity35 side			1
@entity12 erred on the side of caution against @entity15 on tuesday with the @entity35 game in mind @entity35 beat @entity8 2 - 1 at @entity31 to leave @entity12 ' side 15 points adrift of the @entity42 leaders 1 - 0 loss vs @entity15 at the @entity22 : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , can , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 2 - 1 loss vs @entity35 at @entity31 : @entity44 , @entity6 , @entity47 , @entity4 , @entity45 , @entity0 , can , @entity5 , @entity2 , @entity1 , @entity3 win , and @entity12 could have been hailed a tactical genius			1
lose , and @entity8 would be 15 points shy of the @entity42 leaders with a quarter of the season gone			0
in the end , it seems the @entity8 manager all but forfeited a game at the @entity22 to lose at home against @entity35 four days later			2
@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 were those to return to the starting @entity21 @entity3 is yet to score in the @entity42 since making his £ 16million move from @entity66 , and his @entity68 statistics speak volumes			1
the striker did not manage a shot on or off target , and did not create a single chance or a cross			2
the former @entity76 striker was , however , caught offside four times as his heat map shows he barely registered a touch in the visitors ' box			0
@entity12 has little option but to stand by his £ 16m investment while @entity84 is injured after undergoing calf surgery			0
@entity3 is yet to score in the @entity42 since making his £ 16million move from @entity66 @entity3 was substituted in the second half for @entity87 as @entity8 lost 2 - 1 against @entity35 @entity3 's heat map shows the @entity8 striker barely got near @entity35 's goal on saturday at @entity31 @entity46 , who kept @entity91 quiet at the @entity22 , was dropped in favour of @entity4 against @entity35			1
@entity94 columnist @entity93 felt for those that were held back with the @entity35 match in mind , saying : ' when you grow up , you dream about playing against @entity15 in the @entity22			0
' @entity1 got to experience that unique feeling for 21 minutes as a second - half substitute on tuesday night , but the 19 - year - old is another going through an unfortunate spell at @entity8			2
he has not scored in 12 games for club and country and , with his only shot of the match on saturday , could not outwit @entity35 goalkeeper @entity109 from inside the box			0
@entity1 has struggled to reproduce the spark that terrorised teams in the @entity42 last year			0
he continues to be frustrated following the debate over his fitness during @entity116 international duty			0
at the back , @entity46 , a man that kept @entity91 relatively quiet on the @entity120 winner 's own patch , was dropped in favour of @entity4 , who failed to keep a lid on @entity35 's @entity124 with fellow centre - back @entity47			1
@entity8 captain @entity0 , whose infamous slip in this fixture last year led @entity30 to insist it ' gave the title to @entity76 ' , was left frustrated against the boys in blue once more			0
@entity1 got 21 minutes against @entity15 but the 19 - year - old is another going through a tough spell @entity1 has struggled to reproduce the spark that terrorised teams in the @entity42 last season @entity1 had plenty of action down the left but could not take his one chance against @entity35 on saturday @entity0 and his regular first - team peers were denied a full outing on one of the biggest stages in football at the @entity22 , and for what ? to register their third defeat in the space of seven days			1
@entity8 lost against @entity147 at @entity148 last week and face @entity149 next at @entity150			2
it is the stadium where they squandered a three - goal lead last year to draw 3 - 3 , which all but confirmed their title death and left the now - departed @entity156 in tears			0
challenging for the @entity42 title is almost certainly out of the question for @entity12 , who must now put all his energy into qualifying for the @entity18 once more			0
challenging for the @entity42 title is most almost certainly out of the question for manager @entity12 @entity124 's goal against @entity8 settled the 2 - 1 scoreline ... click here to visit @entity94 's @entity165 !			1
