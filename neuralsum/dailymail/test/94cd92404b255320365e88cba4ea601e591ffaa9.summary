@entity0 has moved closer to becoming @entity2 chairman after the @entity3 cleared him to return as a director of the club			1
and the @entity7 - based businessman hopes yesterday ’s decision will now convince the @entity9 to pass him as ‘ fit and proper ’ in the final stage of approval			1
@entity0 won around 85 - per - cent shareholder backing to return to the @entity2 boardroom at the club ’s pivotal extraordinary general meeting last month , but has been holding off from taking up a post until he has cleared all regulatory barriers			1
@entity0 is back on the @entity2 board after being cleared by the @entity3 @entity2 players applaud as they leave the pitch following their 2 - 1 defeat of @entity22 at the weekend he required the consent of the court due to previously being a director in the @entity27 which entered liquidation in 2012			1
‘ i am delighted that at a @entity3 hearing this morning before @entity31 my application to become a director of @entity34 was granted , ’ said @entity0 in a statement			1
‘ today ’s decision has removed the final legal hurdle for me to take up my role on the board following the overwhelming mandate at the @entity40			0
‘ the previous board had raised a little known legal provision stating that because i was a director of @entity2 oldco within 12 months of its liquidation that i must obtain court sanction before becoming a director of @entity47 because the word “ @entity2 ” is in both company names			0
‘ a court would not grant leave to an applicant unless it is satisfied that the circumstances warrant such approval			0
@entity0 ( centre ) celebrates success at the club 's @entity40 alongside @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) ‘ any affected party , eg the liquidator or an aggrieved creditor of the previous company , has the right to be heard at such a hearing			1
‘ the liquidation of @entity68 and the formation of @entity2 @entity70 were not conducted clandestinely but in the full glare of publicity			0
‘ however , being aware of the provision , i sought leave of the @entity3 to accept my board appointment			2
‘ hopefully , this endorsement will also provide the @entity9 with additional comfort to complete its consideration of my fit and proper status			2
‘ all @entity2 supporters have suffered from the failure of full and proper corporate governance over the last four years			0
‘ i am anxious to play my part in ensuring that this is comprehensively remedied for present and future generations of @entity2 supporters			0
‘ i have fully cooperated with the @entity9 over the last few weeks and thank them for the care and attention with which they have undertaken this task			2
‘ i must be the most scrutinised candidate in @entity93 football history but accept this as being preferable to the lack of scrutiny that has been the case in @entity2 recent past — and possibly other clubs			2
‘ i hope matters can be swiftly concluded now that , with the permission of the court , i can take up my role as a director of @entity47			0
