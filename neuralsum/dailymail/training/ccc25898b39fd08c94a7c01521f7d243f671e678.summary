by @entity0 play fights are a long honoured tradition on many a family swimming trip - although they are not usually between mother and son			2
however , this was the situation today when a mother otter and her pup jokingly came to blows at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the pair pushed , prodded , strangled and scrapped in a bid to stay afloat and dunk the other and the whole raucous affair was caught on camera by photographer @entity18 , 51			1
the otters were playfighting so the child could learn how to defend itself before striking out on its own the scrap between mother @entity24 and child @entity26 went on for a little over ten minutes from the pictures the fight might seem vicious but neither animal was seriously hurting the other she said : ' these two @entity32 were play fighting with each other in open water			1
' @entity36 pups stay with their mum for up to a year after birth and play fighting is an essential part of their development to hone their skills for survival			2
' i was fascinated to watch their antics , pushing each other under the water , grabbing , boxing , biting , and wrestling each other			0
' however , i was also very much aware that there is a serious side to their behaviour			0
' on river systems otters are extremely territorial and fighting is common , particularly in populations that are nearing carrying capacity , and this may result in death			0
' the fight between the two otters , nicknamed @entity65 and @entity26 by the centre 's staff , went on for ten minutes and mrs @entity18 took these snaps from only 12 metres away			1
the snaps were taken by photographer @entity18 at the @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 @entity24 eventually admitted defeat to @entity26 and went to sleep on the bank to recoup her energy otter pups stay with their mothers for up to a year after birth and play fighting is important for development she said : ' @entity65 , as any mother would , admitted defeat and went to sleep on the bank			1
' i hope that future generations will continue to have the opportunity to see our native wildlife in their natural habitats			0
' i believe we should respect our natural heritage and that our existing countryside			0
' the return of otters to most of @entity91 has been one of the major conservation success stories of the last 30 years			0
' @entity18 was standing only metres away from the animals to take these fascinating pictures hopefully , @entity26 will be able to fend for himself thanks to his mother 's training			2

@entity65 and @entity26 were play fighting at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12
the mothers play fight with their pups to teach them to defend themselves
these snaps were taken by photographer @entity18 , 51
