@entity2 's @entity1 destiny is slipping out of their hands after they were beaten 26 - 19 by star - studded @entity4 at @entity6			2
@entity2 had never lost the back - to - back contests of rounds three and four but @entity4 became the first to do that double over the former champions following their historic 16 - 9 win at @entity12 a week earlier			2
it means @entity4 are firm automatic quarter - final qualifiers after they moved four - points clear at the top of a hugely competitive @entity17 having collected 17 points ahead of @entity19 , with @entity2 third on 10 points - the @entity23 team facing @entity19 and @entity24 next month			1
@entity25 ( left ) breaks away to score a try during @entity4 's @entity1 victory over @entity2 @entity25 crosses the line as @entity4 move four points clear at the top of their pool 1 @entity25 is congratulated by team - mates after scoring one of the tries of the tournament the match was a fast and furious contest but - while @entity2 gave it their all - it was @entity4 who had the class where it mattered most in the backs			1
@entity2 started strongly and went six points clear with two @entity45 penalties - and his injury - time effort earned them a losing bonus point - but @entity4 produced some glorious flowing rugby to conjure up a couple of memorable tries			1
@entity52 was one of those weaving his magic and @entity2 simply ran out of defenders for skipper @entity56 to finish off a magnificent team try			0
then , just before the break , a scintillating solo effort from wing @entity25 produced another contender for try of the tournament and @entity65 's conversion made it 15 - 6 at the break			0
@entity52 ( right ) pulled the strings as the @entity69 side completed the double over @entity2 @entity71 ( left ) makes a high challenge before later receiving a yellow card later in the game @entity75 ( centre ) of @entity4 charges upfield at the @entity6 @entity56 ( 2nd left ) is congratulated by team - mates after scoring a magnificent team try @entity2 had contested every scrap of possession with great intensity - @entity82 always in the thick of things - but a yellow card for full back @entity71 for a trip on outside half @entity88 , who ended up with 11 points from the boot , left them a man short and facing an even higher mountain to climb			1
@entity4 had the upper hand in the scrums while @entity2 had their best moments at the breakdown but , when it came to posing threats with the ball in hand , @entity88 sending a pinpoint cross kick for @entity56 to collect unopposed and cross for his second and @entity4 's third			0
@entity102 finally found the way to the @entity4 line late on and @entity45 converted but @entity4 had already done the damage .			0

@entity4 were too strong for @entity2 in @entity1 clash
the @entity69 side did the double to move four points clear at top of @entity113
@entity25 produced a *stunning* try while @entity23 team earned bonus point
