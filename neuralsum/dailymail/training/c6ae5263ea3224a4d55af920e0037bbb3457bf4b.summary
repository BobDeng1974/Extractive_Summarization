by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 14 september 2012 a mother - to - be inspired her electronic engineer husband to devise a new low - cost baby scanner which could save hundreds of thousands of lives			1
sonar expert @entity6 used cheap components to make a hand - held scanner which can plug into a laptop and produce pictures of the unborn child on the computer screen			1
the @entity15 lecturer ’s device could be manufactured for £ 30 - £ 40 compared to the ultrasound machines in @entity18 hospitals which cost £ 20,000 to £ 100,000			1
that means the scanners - devised by mr @entity6 and research associate @entity21 - would be much more affordable for developing countries			1
low - cost : sonar expert @entity6 ( left ) and phd student @entity21 used cheap components to make a hand - held scanner which can plug into a laptop and produce pictures of an unborn child on a computer screen in use : mr @entity6 demonstrates his new ultrasound scanner with mother - to - be @entity30 from @entity15 the 39 - year - old father - of - two was inspired when his wife @entity32 was expecting their first daughter , who is now seven			1
he said : ' the idea came from my own experiences sat looking at the pictures of our unborn child			1
' it was my wife ’s idea - she suggested we could apply what we knew to make them more affordable and make a low - cost system for lots of people around the world			1
' my background is in sonar which is very similar to ultrasound			2
' i started to have a think and i just treated it as an interesting engineering challenge , to see what was the absolute minimum cost of components needed to produce any kind of useful image			2
' we ticked along on a shoe - string budget then we started to get some promising results and so we got funding to build a prototype			0
' we used techniques we use in sonar signal production to simplify the circuitry and transducer design while trying to maintain a reasonable resolution in the images			0
' we are not at the stage where we can completely match the image quality of a really high - end scanner but we are getting closer and closer			2
' the technology could have a major life - saving effect as @entity75 figures show 250,000 women die every year from complications during pregnancy or child birth			2
many deaths are avoidable , but for a lack of equipment			0
mr @entity6 said his images could easily show if a baby was in the breach position , but the definition was not yet high enough to determine the sex			0
staggering saving : the device could be manufactured for £ 30 - £ 40 compared to the ultrasound machines in @entity18 hospitals which cost £ 20,000 to £ 100,000 important work : the technology could have a major life - saving effect as @entity75 figures show 250,000 women die every year from complications during pregnancy or child birth there were other uses away from obstetrics , such as diagnosing gallstones and liver problems , but health professionals will determine what else could be done with the technology			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity15 ’s @entity105 , is an expert in underwater sonar technology and has developed systems for imaging the seabed - looking for ship wrecks or specific geographical features - as well as underwater communications and tracking systems			1
he said : ' we are just trying to get the resolution of the images as good as we can , then we will hand it over to the experts			0
' my wife is very excited about it			0
' i keep reminding her it was all her idea			0
' there is still work to be done and it is by no means the finished product but we are very optimistic			0
' vets and farmers have also expressed interest in low - cost scanning			0
the research was funded through an @entity131 .			0

sonar expert @entity6 used cheap components to make a hand - held scanner which can plug into a laptop
pictures of the unborn child can then be viewed on the computer *'s* screen
device could be manufactured for £ 30 to £ 40 compared to the ultrasound machines in hospitals which cost *betweem* £ 20,000 to £ 100,000
