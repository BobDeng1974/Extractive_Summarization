@entity29 ( left ) from @entity23 was brought in to replace @entity30 ( right ) at the @entity31 in @entity20			2
mr @entity9 was found dead on wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest mr @entity9 stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism			1
when contacted , staff at the @entity31 refused to answer questions about the former preacher 's time there over the course of six days , almost 100 members of the @entity45 organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island 's capital , @entity51			1
the city 's police headquarters were blown up in the coup , with mr @entity22 described by a @entity56 report of being ' responsible for organising the use ' of the explosives involved			1
the coup ended after six days with the insurgents ' surrendering on the condition of amnesty on august 1			2
twenty - four people had been killed in the anarchy			0
it is understood mr @entity22 replaced mr @entity9 at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity67 , some time around 2013			1
he is registered as having lived in @entity67 since 2005			2
mr @entity9 stepped down from the @entity19 last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism			1
when approached this afternoon mr @entity22 , who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs , denied any knowledge of any dispute			1
@entity22 is named in a @entity23 parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990			1
he is described as being ' responsible ' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters mr @entity22 did not comment on claims mr @entity9 had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached arriving for midday prayers the man , who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard , told the @entity89 : ' feud ? i know nothing about that			1
' all i can say is from @entity94 we come , and to @entity94 we return			0
' when contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about mr @entity9 's time there			1
a statement printed on a piece of paper and taped to its front door read : ' we have with great sadness heard of the unfortunate death of @entity108 [ sic ] @entity110 who was the @entity111 of the @entity112 who served from 2005 to 2011 , he will be sadly missed			0
' we send our sympathies and condolences to his family , the @entity117 and friends			0
may @entity94 forgive him and open the doors of mercy onto him			0
' but one friend of the late imam said the dispute between the father of six and the @entity125 had been heated			2
solicitor @entity126 , 43 , said there had been conflict about the ' running ' of the mosque			0
there is no suggestion that either mr @entity22 or the @entity19 in @entity20 is suspected of any involvement in his death , with counter terrorism police still investigating			1
@entity136 officers called in the specialist division because ' of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad '			0
' the investigation remains in its very early stages and officers remain open - minded about the motive , ' a spokesman added			2
earlier this week sources close to the mr @entity9 said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the @entity151 president @entity150 - of whom the imam was a fierce critic			1
describing his father as ' the most peaceful man you could meet , ' one of his six children , @entity155 , said he was ' actively involved in the fight against extremism '			0
' he did not care what your background , race or status was			0
he did not care if you were rich or poor			0
' he just wanted to help people in need			0
he spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it , ' he said in a statement			0
later his 23 - year - old daughter , @entity172 , said while her father was openly ' against @entity150 ' , she did not think that was the reason behind his killing			1
mr @entity9 's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the @entity150 regime			1
speaking at the family home ( above ) , his 23 - year - old daughter said that was likely ' not the reason ' @entity22 was involved in the attempted coup of @entity23 in 1990			1
above , a rebel fighter stands with his @entity188 during the six - day standoff almost 25 years ago , around 100 members of the radical @entity45 group @entity27 stormed @entity23 and @entity192 's @entity191 in @entity51			1
they were demanding that the then prime minister , @entity193 , resign and that new elections be held , accusing the leader of wild extravagance while , they said , its working classes went hungry			0
the rebels blew up @entity51 's police headquarters and stormed a state - run television channel in a bid to take control of the @entity23 capital			2
the @entity27 's leader , @entity205 , appeared ominously on air during the first day of the coup attempt			2
among one of their hostages was mr @entity193			0
the prime minister was shot and beaten during the six - day coup			0
violence and looting ravaged the city as all those who had been in the buildings when the @entity27 stormed remained in their capture			0
on its sixth day , the rebels agreed to surrender on the condition of amnesty - releasing what remaining hostages they were keeping unharmed			2
they were all arrested and charged with treason but later released after producing copies of an amnesty that had been agreed when brokering an end to the coup			0
@entity22 , formerly known in the @entity7 as @entity231 , is thought to have separated from the @entity27 in 2001			1
years later he was shot four times in the legs , leaving him in need of a wheelchair			0
he had tried to establish his own @entity238 group , according to the @entity23 press			0
in 2004 a local report claimed he had been turned down for asylum by the @entity242 having told them that his life would be in danger if he returned to the @entity7 island			2
the attempted coup brought the island 's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days but friends and neighbours claimed critics of the @entity150 regime had been targeted in the area , with some residents who displayed green flags , a sign of opposition to the @entity151 government , having their tyres slashed			1
mr @entity9 grew up in @entity264 , the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the @entity267 under the orders of @entity269 , the current president 's father			1
he fled the country as a 16 - year - old , taking refuge in the @entity274 while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years			1
one of the mourners who gathered in his memory at @entity280 in @entity281 , north west @entity67 , said he had returned to @entity151 in recent years to dissuade fighters from aligning themselves with the government			2
the source claimed mr @entity9 stopped going to the country on advice from the @entity288 authorities			2
the @entity289 , where mr @entity9 used to be one of the main imams , has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers			2
it became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run			0
@entity302 has been missing for 16 months , and was last seen entering @entity289 dressed as a man before leaving in a full - length covering designed for women which obscured his identity			0
he was subject to a @entity308 and @entity307 , which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism			0
other extremists linked to the mosque include @entity315 , the son of hate preacher @entity316 , who has regularly led prayers at @entity318 .			0
