@entity0 endured plenty of frustrating days as @entity3 manager but his final one in charge was among the most challenging			1
the 67 - year - old quit after being told he needs knee replacements but maybe the decision would have been even harder had transfer deadline day at @entity10 been more productive			1
@entity0 knew his squad needed bolstering to drag themselves out of the relegation zone			1
it is why he wanted to sign @entity16 ’s @entity15 , the striker he worked with in his previous job at @entity16			1
@entity0 quit @entity3 on tuesday with the club second bottom of the @entity20 @entity0 says his knee problem was the main reason why he had to quit @entity3 as he could no longer walk @entity3 were keen to sign @entity16 striker @entity15 on loan but could n't afford his wages @entity3 ’s transfer spend since @entity0 took the managerial reins - at least £ 12million more than any other club outside the @entity20 ’s current top seven teams			1
@entity3 were so desperate to land the @entity29 on loan they offered to pay three - quarters of his £ 100,000 - per - week salary			1
but @entity15 made it clear on monday morning that he had no intention of swapping life at @entity35 for a relegation battle			1
@entity16 chairman @entity37 was happy to do a deal with @entity3 but when @entity15 turned down the move @entity3 , @entity37 then refused to let him go to @entity40 , who offered to pay only 50 per cent of his salary			1
@entity3 then turned their attentions to a swap deal that would have seen @entity45 , only recently signed on loan from @entity40 , return to @entity48 with @entity49 heading in the other direction			1
@entity0 was excited about signing @entity49 , telling @entity51 of his desire to do the swap			2
a deal was agreed but it collapsed minutes before the deadline because of a rule that stipulates a club can not send back a loan player in the same window			0
the fact club officials , led by head of football operations @entity61 , dedicated a considerable amount of time to the deal is believed to have understandably infuriated @entity0 , who found it hard to comprehend that @entity3 ’s deal - makers were unaware of the rule			1
@entity3 only signed @entity45 ( left ) on loan during january 's transfer window , but he has made little impact @entity3 were keen to sign @entity71 's @entity40 team - mate @entity49 ( right ) but failed to finalise a deal it meant @entity3 ’ only signing january signing was @entity45 , a player @entity0 no longer wanted			1
since his arrival in january , @entity45 played just 14 minutes of football			0
and despite the club ’s efforts to strengthen the squad , their lack of money – due to self - imposed financial constraints as they look to comply with @entity77 regulations – meant @entity0 was left with a virtually identical squad			2
@entity0 ’s relationship with co-owner @entity87 - who has been forced to spend considerable time away from the club in recent weeks due to the recent @entity92 tragedy - has always been amicable , but the businessman was not willing to spend much money on monday , tweeting : ‘ no more cheque book			2
bought all players the manager asked for in summer			0
our players are not mercenaries			0
if something interesting comes up we will look at it			0
but i ’m not optimistic			0
given the right motivation , tactics and coaching we can achieve much more			0
the arrival of @entity61 , now one of the frontrunners for the job , is also said to have altered the atmosphere and dynamic at the club ’s @entity112			0
@entity0 ( left ) says he had a good relationship with @entity3 owner @entity87 @entity0 guided @entity3 back to the @entity20 at the first attempt via the play - offs @entity0 holds aloft the @entity120 play - off trophy after they defeated @entity119 last season players arrived at the club ’s west @entity122 on tuesday unaware of what was to come , despite the fact @entity0 had already made his decision and told those closest to him in the morning			1
as is often the case , @entity0 did n’t take the session because of his health , leaving that task to his trusted right - hand man @entity132			2
but @entity0 was there , overseeing training – having his say at regular intervals			2
after the ball - work session , players made their way into gym for a 45 minute weights session , before heading into the showers			0
his assistants @entity144 and @entity145 followed last night			0
as players emerged from the showers they were confronted with whispers			0
many of them did n’t believe it at first given @entity0 ’s normal demeanour earlier in the morning			2
@entity61 ( right ) is currently taking charge of @entity3 alongside fellow coach @entity154 former @entity16 boss @entity155 is among the early favourites to replace @entity0 at @entity3 the players were shocked but they knew his knees had been troubling him			1
@entity61 and @entity154 have been handed the reins for the time being , but who will be entrusted with replacing @entity0 on a permanent basis ? @entity155 seems the logical choice			0
his old @entity16 pals @entity61 and @entity154 would certainly vouch for him			0
likewise , the feeling amongst the @entity3 squad is that it is @entity155 ’s job to turn down .			0

@entity0 resigned as @entity3 manager on tuesday
@entity0 cited *imminent* knee operations as reason for his departure
@entity3 failed to secure prime target @entity15 on deadline day
