by @entity0 dogs with @entity2 often over-groom , suck blankets jump repeatedly is one of them			1
canines with the condition often over-groom , suck blankets and chase their own tails obsessively			0
and while humans with @entity2 may not share the same repetitive behaviours as dogs , scientists believe that genes causing diseases or medical conditions in dogs may also be responsible for same conditions in humans			1
@entity23 , the owner of a @entity25 shepherd called @entity26 , noticed that as a pup the dog started to jump up and bite the air repeatedly			1
‘ it ’s like he sees something			0
he jumps and when he 's biting , he bites hard			0
you can hear his teeth against each other , ’ she told the @entity30			0
' he can do this for hours and he gets more and more stressed when he ´ s doing it			0
he never rests between jumps , ' she added			0
@entity26 ’ repetitive behaviour , which includes ‘ fly - catching , ’ where dogs snap at thin air as if they are catching flies , was diagnosed as @entity2			1
scientists think that dogs having medical conditions in common with humans meaning that they are one of the most important models for human hereditary diseases and by studying them , researchers could come up with new ways to treat human sufferers			1
professor @entity55 , of @entity56 in @entity57 and the @entity58 in @entity59 , explained that it is easier to identify genes in dogs than in people , because humans have been breeding canines with specific characteristics for centuries			1
scientists think that dogs having medical conditions in common with humans - such as @entity2 , which is illustrated by obsessive hand washing - mean that they are one of the most important models for human hereditary diseases and by studying them , researchers could come up with new ways to treat human sufferers obsessive compulsive disorder ( @entity2 ) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour			1
unpleasant thoughts or urges can enter a person 's mind and cause them anxiety , @entity79 said			0
a compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to prevent an obsession coming true - for example , someone who is obsessively scared they will catch a disease might feel the need to wash their hands repeatedly			2
@entity2 symptoms can range from mild to severe			2
for example , some people with @entity2 may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive - compulsive thinking and behaviour and for others , the condition can completely take over their life			1
a number of factors are thought to trigger @entity2			2
evidence suggests that in some cases the condition may run in families and is linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain 's development			0
this means that disease – carrying genes are widespread in certain breeds and that they are similar genetically			0
‘ in dogs we can find [ disease - causing ] genes with only a few hundred sick and healthy dogs , whereas in people thousands of patients and controls are needed , ’ she said			0
in 2005 her team identified the genetic sequence for a female boxer dog and together with other researchers , they have found that the sequence is quite similar to humans so that genes responsible for diseases in dogs , might also cause the same conditions in humans			1
in a recent study in the journal @entity140 , the scientists identified four genes that are associated with @entity2 in dogs and they are trying to work out if the same genes are involved in the human condition too			1
professor @entity55 said : ‘ since the disease symptoms and medications used in dogs and people are similar , we expect that the same genes or other genes with similar functions will be responsible for the disease also in humans			1
’ dogs are also susceptible to other human conditions , including epilepsy , narcolepsy , cancer , retinal degeneration and haemophilia			2
the identification of the genes responsible for narcolepsy in canines has enabled scientists to find an unknown pathway in the brain and another study has led to the development of a new gene therapy for haemophilia			1
@entity23 , the owner of a @entity25 shepherd called @entity26 , ( a stock image of the dog breed is pictured ) noticed that as a pup the dog started to jump up and bite the air repeatedly			1
@entity26 was later diagnosed with having @entity2 genetics researchers from the @entity179 examined ocd among 400 dogs in 2013			1
breeds such as bull terriers and @entity25 shepherds ( like @entity26 ) were particularly prone to chasing their tails , which led the researchers to believe genetics plays a role			2
but then they noticed other connections			0
dogs which were fed nutritional supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails , which suggested diet also figures in @entity2			2
dogs that were separated particularly early from their mother or had poor care from their mother also exhibited @entity2 - style signs of behaviour			2
however the researchers found that a lack of exercise did not make any difference with tail - chasing			0
the study found that dogs that were fed nutritional supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails ( illustrated ) , which suggests diet figures in @entity2 researcher @entity212 said : ‘ tail - chasing in dogs can be used as an animal model for studying the genetic background of @entity2 in humans			1
’ @entity219 tail chasing occurs in several dog breeds , but worldwide it is most common in breeds such as @entity223 and @entity25 shepherds			0
the aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of tail chasing in dogs , to identify possible environmental risk factors and to find out whether a previously discovered gene region associated with compulsive behaviour is also linked to tail chasing			0
blood samples were taken from the dogs participating in the study , and their owners filled out a questionnaire about their dogs ' stereotypical behaviour			0
one of the most interesting findings of this study was the connection with behaviour and vitamins and minerals			0
dogs that received nutritional supplements , especially vitamins and minerals , with their food , chased their tails less			0
‘ our study does not prove an actual causal relationship between vitamins and lessened tail chasing , but interestingly similar preliminary results have been observed in human @entity2 ’ said dr @entity212			2
scientists are looking at how certain vitamins and minerals in a human diet could help @entity2 sufferers .			1

@entity57 researchers believe that genes responsible for diseases in dogs might cause the same conditions in humans
together with scientists from the @entity58 in @entity59 they identified four genes that are associated with @entity2 in dogs
the team is *investigating* whether the same genes are involved in the human condition too , which could one day lead to new treatments
like humans , dogs with @entity2 have obsessive urges and one @entity25 shepherd has been shown to jump repeatedly to catch *imaginary* flies
