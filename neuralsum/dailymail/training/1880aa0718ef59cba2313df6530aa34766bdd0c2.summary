by @entity1 reporter published : 13:08 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 06:21 est , 5 august 2012 culture secretary @entity2 was today criticised by @entity3 for meeting @entity5 boss @entity4 on the fringes of the @entity7			2
@entity8 said it was ' quite inappropriate ' for mr @entity2 to chat with the media mogul , while @entity11 said he appeared to show ' no contrition ' over his handling of @entity5 's bid for satellite broadcaster @entity15			1
but a source close to the @entity2 said the meeting was no more than a chance encounter after the pair separately attended swimming events at the @entity23 @entity22 last night			1
the two men shook hands and smiled as they exchanged a few words before parting , but their conversation , lasting less than a minute , was not recorded			2
an aide to mr @entity2 told the @entity41 : ' they were both at the swimming and bumped into each other and shook hands and said hello			1
that 's all there was to it			0
' i think they were talking about the swimming			0
' mr @entity4 was at the @entity22 as a guest of @entity36 mayor @entity53 , while mr @entity2 is a regular visitor to the @entity7 venues in his capacity as culture secretary			1
all smiles : the meeting last for less than a minute in what a source close to the @entity2 said had been a chance encounter enjoying the @entity7 : mr @entity4 was at the @entity22 as a guest of @entity36 mayor @entity53 , while mr @entity2 is a regular visitor to the @entity7 venues in his capacity as @entity2 mr @entity8 told the @entity41 : ' @entity2 just does n't seem to be able to help himself			1
he is repeatedly careless and this is another example of it			0
' it 's quite inappropriate , after what has happened , that the two of them should be together at any stage			0
he should be avoiding @entity4 like the plague			0
' and mr @entity11 , a member of the @entity72 which carried out an inquiry into phone - hacking at the @entity5 - owned @entity75 , said it appeared the relationship between mr @entity2 and mr @entity4 was ' as close as ever '			1
' the relationship between the @entity79 and the @entity4 empire still looks strong , ' said mr @entity11			2
on the offensive : @entity82 @entity8 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) have criticised mr @entity2 's conduct ' and after everything that 's gone on , the very fact that @entity53 invited @entity4 to the @entity7 is outrageous			1
what do @entity88 's family make of that i wonder ? there appears to be no contrition whatsoever for the mistakes			0
' mr @entity4 has faced questioning on the hacking of mobile phones , including that of teenage murder victim @entity88 , by both the @entity3 ' committee and the @entity98 into press standards			2
seven former journalists at the @entity75 , including ex-editors @entity101 and @entity103 , have been charged with offences in relation to the phone - hacking inquiry			0
' outrageous ' : mr @entity11 questioned what the family of murdered teenager @entity88 ( above ) would make the meeting given that mr @entity4 has faced questioning on the hacking of her mobile phone mr @entity2 came under intense pressure earlier this year when the @entity98 uncovered a cache of emails detailing contacts between his office and @entity5 lobbyist @entity118 during the abortive bid for @entity15			1
critics also questioned his impartiality after it emerged he had written to @entity122 prior to being given quasi-judicial authority over the bid , arguing the case for the deal to go ahead			0
however , the @entity2 insisted he had handled the case impartially on the basis of independent advice .			0
