by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:20 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 13 december 2013 shoppers stocking up on everything they need for a @entity5 dinner face paying up to 28 per cent more than they did just three years ago			2
the price of turkeys , potatoes , cakes , wine and chocolates have risen several times faster than wages , hitting families in the pocket			1
@entity17 claimed the figures means there will be ' real worry ' about the cost of celebrating this year , and accused the government of failing to boost wages as the economy recovers			1
cost : there have been above inflation rises in the cost of poultry , potatoes and cakes since the election , while wages have risen by just 6 per cent with just shopping 11 days left until @entity5 , all of the big name supermarkets have launched campaigns claiming to offer the best deals			1
but figures compiled by @entity17 show how the price of festive favourites have risen dramatically			1
poultry has soared by 14.6 per cent since may 2010 , hitting anyone planning to serve traditional turkey on the big day			1
even more alarmingly potatoes have soared by 28.1 per cent , more than double the rate of inflation of 12.7 per cent over the same period			2
however wages have risen by just 6 per cent since the election			1
anyone with a sweet tooth will also feel the pinch , with biscuits and cakes up 21 per cent and sweets and chocolates 18.3 per cent more expensive			1
the cost of a @entity5 tipple has also risen , with wine and spirits up 14.5 per cent			2
the figures also reveal that vegetables have risen by 7.2 per cent and beer 11.4 per cent , slower than the rate of inflation			0
squeeze : this graph shows the increase in prices since may 2010 compared to the rise in wages , which means families are having to make their money go further most voters believe they would be no better off financially under a @entity17 government , polling has found			1
around a third of voters - 32 per cent - think the opposition would leave them with less cash in their pockets while nearly the same amount - 31 per cent - said they would be ' much the same as i am today '			2
a quarter of adults believed they would have more money , the @entity84 survey for @entity85 found			0
labour leader @entity87 's electoral strategy is based on the so - called ' cost of living crisis ' and has included a pledge to cap energy bills for 20 months if he wins in 2015			2
according to the research , confidence in the party 's ability to handle the economy is low , with 42 per cent believing it would be in a worse state if @entity17 had won last time			1
overall the @entity98 are on 35 per cent , @entity17 on 39 per cent , @entity99 on 11 per cent and the @entity100 on 9 per cent			2
@entity17 ’s shadow cabinet minister @entity101 said : ‘ @entity103 ’s cost - of - @entity5 crisis is hitting families up and down the country			1
‘ out of touch ministers need to spend time around the kitchen tables of those paying bills or nervous about the @entity5 shopping			0
‘ families are £ 1,600 a year worse off under @entity103 and there is real worry this winter that the basics are unaffordable , treats are out of reach and better times out of sight			1
‘ what we need is a lasting recovery for all , based on job - creation , a freeze on energy bills and support for working families			0
’ he added : ‘ families should be able to celebrate without compromise at @entity5 but the fact so many can not celebrate as they wish this festive period only underlines the damage done by @entity103 ’s government			0
’ the @entity133 said it was trying to reduce food prices			0
a spokesman said : ' farming is now a global industry and is susceptible to the market when prices rise as well as when they fall			0
' the government is working to reduce price increases by opening up global markets and promoting competition in our own food and farming industries			0
' the government has been stung by criticism that despite a return to economic growth most people feel no better off			1
wages have risen by a fraction of the increase in prices			0
but yesterday chancellor @entity156 seized on figures from the @entity158 showing that average earnings were now keeping pace with inflation			0
he told the @entity162 : ‘ it shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent			0
' that is , of course , the current rate of inflation			0
so i think that points to the broader argument that i have been making , which is that as the economy recovers , that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy , and you ca n't pretend that the two are n't connected , that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan			0

since the election poultry us up 14.6 ****%**** , potatoes 28 ****%**** and sweets 18.3 ****%****
wages are up just 6 ****%**** since may 2010 despite a return to economic growth
@entity17 warns there will be ' real worry ' about the cost of celebrating
but new poll shows voters do n't think they would be better off with @entity17
