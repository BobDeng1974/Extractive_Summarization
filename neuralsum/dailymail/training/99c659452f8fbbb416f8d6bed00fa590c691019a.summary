@entity0 has released dramatic footage of the moment a @entity3 rocket crashed into a barge			1
the company 's founder unveiled the images of the falcon 9 landing after persuasion on @entity10 by the game pioneer behind @entity12 , @entity13			1
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following its launch on saturday			1
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			1
the company 's founder unveiled the images after persuasion on @entity10 by the game pioneer behind @entity12 , @entity13 @entity28 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			1
@entity3 has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its @entity34 rocket back on @entity35 after it takes its supplies to the @entity38 last saturday 's mission was the group 's first attempt to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea , which was held in position using deep - sea oil rigs			1
while the launch went well , a failure in its hydraulic control fins brought the rocket down at the wrong angle			0
earlier today @entity0 tweeted : ' next rocket landing on drone ship in two to three weeks away more hydraulic fluid			2
at least it should explode for a different reason			0
' saturday 's mission was the group 's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea , which was held in position using deep - sea oil rigs			2
pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion @entity0 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			2
@entity3 has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its @entity34 rocket back on @entity35 after it takes its supplies to the @entity38 recovering the rocket involved re-lighting its engines on re-entry for a series of three burns			1
the first were two adjusted the predicted landing point and reduce its speed from 4,265ft per second to 820ft per second			0
a final ' landing burn ' slowed the speed further to around 6.5ft per second as the rocket lowers its landing legs			0
four ' hypersonic grid fins ' placed around the rocket were meant to deploye on re-entry			0
each fin moves independently to help control roll , pitch and yaw			0
however , these malfunctioned , causing the crash			0
the modified barge - nearly the size of a football field - was positioned a couple hundred miles off @entity100 's northeastern coast			1
the uncrewed platform was spared serious damage from the impact , although some equipment on deck will need to be replaced , according to @entity0 initially , @entity0 had insisted that the company did n't get good video of the impact , and that the team would have to piece together information from ' telemetry and … actual pieces '			1
in the weeks preceding the landing test , @entity0 had estimated there was a 50 - 50 chance , at best , that the @entity34 's first - stage booster would land vertically on the platform			1
a pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well , but company officials conceded before saturday 's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging			0
once separated from the upper stage of the rocket saturday , the main booster re-ignited as planned for the fly back , according to @entity3			2
initially , @entity0 had insisted that the company did n't get good video of the impact , and that the team would have to piece together information from ' telemetry and … actual pieces ' in the weeks preceding the landing test , @entity0 ( left ) had estimated there was a 50 - 50 chance , at best , that the @entity34 's first - stage booster would land vertically on the platform			1
he issued the pictured after prompts from gaming pioneerjohn @entity139 ( right ) @entity3 successfully launched a supply rocket to the @entity38 on saturday , the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012			2
however the landing was n't as smooth automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous , modified barge			0
the @entity148 maintained the ability , as always , to destroy the booster if it strayed off course			0
@entity3 's primary mission was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of station supplies ordered up by @entity153 , including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company 's cargo ships			2
the company , headquartered in @entity161 , @entity162 , also has been contracted by @entity153 to develop beefed - up dragons for astronaut rides to the space station , beginning as early as 2017			0
@entity166 also is hard at work on a manned capsule			0
in the meantime , @entity153 is paying tens of millions of dollars to @entity170 for each @entity172 astronaut launched aboard the @entity174 spacecraft			0
a barge floating off the coast of @entity177 , @entity100 , was supposed to recover the leftover booster , but components came down too hard and broke apart , according to @entity3 founder @entity0 onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the @entity34 rocket , which lit up the sky over @entity185 , @entity100 on saturday			1

footage was tweeted after persuasion by game pioneer , @entity13
the images show the rocket approaching the barge on @entity100 's coast
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle
initially , @entity0 had insisted @entity3 did n't get good video of the explosion
the flight on saturday was part @entity3 ' goal to land the largest stage of its @entity34 rocket back on @entity35 after taking supplies to the @entity38
