@entity2 , a @entity1 who was suspected of being a security guard to @entity12 but never charged with a crime , wrote how he was drugged , sexually abused , beaten and trampled in the notorious prison			1
@entity2 , who was cleared for release five years ago but has yet to be let go , said guards would work in shifts to subject him to brutal , continuous interrogations lasting three months at a time			1
in a first - person account published by @entity21 , @entity2 told how he would be abused beyond the point of collapse , and prison guards would watch over him in hospital , waiting for the moment he was cleared for release so the process could start again			1
the inmate - who insists on his innocence - says his prolonged torture ' achieved nothing ' , but brought ' shame ' on the @entity10			1
in the account , he wrote : ' i think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months			1
two teams of interrogators running shifts , day and night			2
' each session begins with shouting , to wake me up			0
then they hit me on the face and the back			0
i am so desperate for sleep , my head is swimming			2
' there are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room			0
they demand that i identify the individuals , but i can barely focus to see if i might know them			0
' he describes being injected and knocked out when it is obvious he will be of no use identifying the men			0
imprisoned : @entity2 said his interrogation sessions - which yielded no results - would last for months on end ( file photo ) incarcerated : @entity2 spent more than a decade in @entity5 - and despite being cleared for release in 2009 is still there @entity2 also says that he tried to go on hunger strike , but was laughed at , had food poured on him and was then force - fed intravenously			1
when he eventually gave in , he said : ' i tell the interrogators that i ca n't face not eating any more			0
they throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig			0
' they wo n't let me go to the restroom			0
they watch as it gets more painful , and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if i pee in my pants			0
' @entity2 also describes psychologically damaging routines that @entity5 guards would act out - including showing him images of bestiality - a man having sex with a donkey - and videos of other prisoners being abused			1
he added that guards shaved off his beard in what he terms ' a gratuitous insult to my religion			0
' bundled out : @entity2 ( who is not pictured in the file photo above ) also spoke of psychologically damaging acts - such as forcing him to watch films of bestiality , and forcibly shaving off his beard the account was prompted by the release of a lengthy @entity103 report on torture , which has caused outrage among lawmakers , the public and other nations			1
however , @entity2 points out that the torture report does not cover the situation the @entity112 administration has a long - held ambition to shut down @entity5 , but the process has taken longer than hoped - partly because it is difficult to find somewhere to send prisoners once they are released			1
this week six former inmates were rehomed in @entity118 after being held for more than a dozen years			2
the six men - four @entity120 , a @entity121 and a @entity122 - were accepted by the @entity124 country as refugees and were seen walking around the capital city of @entity127 , seemingly enjoying their freedom			2
freed : pictured above are two @entity120 prisoners - @entity130 , front , and @entity132 - who were recently released and given asylum in @entity118			2

@entity2 , from @entity1 , has been held for more than 13 years
