hundreds of paedophiles will escape justice because @entity3 ’s crime agency failed to act on a cache of information			0
senior investigators at the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) sat on the names of 2,345 suspects for at least 14 months , it emerged last night			1
by the time local police forces got involved , little action could be taken because of the time that had passed , and some of the suspects had even died			1
senior investigators at the @entity8 , pictured , sat on the names of 2,345 suspects for at least 14 months , it has emerged the list of names was provided by @entity22 police in july 2012 after they smashed a notorious online store that specialised in indecent images of naked children			1
officers in @entity27 identified thousands of potential paedophiles and passed the names to forces worldwide via @entity31			2
but the @entity8 apparently left the file gathering dust until november 2013 , when it passed it on to police forces			1
even then some forces failed to act for months			0
many cases have now had to be abandoned because the information was simply out of date			0
@entity39 said the ‘ age of the intelligence and the timescale difference ’ meant that in three cases magistrates refused to grant search warrants			0
@entity46 said no action was taken against five suspects due to the ‘ age of the offence and lack of supporting evidence ’			2
in @entity54 , 60 suspects were identified but none was arrested , even though further investigations were carried out			0
the force did not explain why			0
the failings were highlighted this week as it emerged paedophile @entity60 , 46 , a deputy headteacher at a boys ’ school in @entity63 , was only visited by @entity64 last month , ten months after the @entity8 passed on his name from the list and more than two years after the @entity22 inquiry , known as @entity68			1
teacher @entity69 , who was named on the list police and national crime investigators did nothing about a paedophile teacher for 18 months			1
@entity69 , 60 , from @entity64 , who had worked at a £ 26,000 - a - year boarding school and as a school bus driver , was on the list of around 2,500 @entity3 suspected paedophiles identified by a @entity22 inquiry and handed over to the @entity3 ’s @entity80 in july 2012			1
the @entity8 only sent the names out to police forces in november last year – and @entity84 police then waited until january to visit @entity69 at his home in @entity86			1
last week , a court finally barred him from working with children in classrooms or on school buses			0
police found 228 indecent images and videos of young boys , aged 10 to 14 , at the retired teacher ’s home			1
but @entity69 , who pleaded guilty , walked free from court with a three - year community order			0
he is the only one of 35 suspected @entity64 paedophiles identified by @entity22 police to be convicted			1
cancer specialist @entity102 , who was found guilty of child sex offences last month , was not arrested for 16 months after his name was given to the @entity8			2
the revelations came as children ’s charity the @entity106 said police are struggling to cope with the mountain of child abuse images they have to deal with			2
experts said they are ‘ gravely concerned ’ that some police forces do not have enough resources to investigate online abuse			1
doubts were also raised about the @entity8			2
critics said the @entity80 , the unit of the @entity8 that received the @entity22 intelligence in 2012 and which was absorbed into the @entity8 when it took over in 2013 , is also struggling to keep up with the flood of child abuse cases			1
the failings are a huge embarrassment for the fledgling @entity8 , created by the government as @entity3 ’s answer to the @entity127			0
the @entity128 said it is now assessing whether to launch a full inquiry – which would be the first the @entity8 has faced			0
@entity130 , a child safety expert and @entity133 adviser , said police must act on sensitive intelligence when it is ‘ fresh ’			0
he said : ‘ the whole reason for the existence of @entity80 and the @entity8 is to handle and pass on information like this to local forces to act on			2
‘ i can only imagine it is the sheer volume of reports that is behind this , there can not be any other reason as this is what they are there to do			0
‘ this information needs to be fresh and police need to take action as soon as they possibly can to catch offenders and safeguard children			0
’ a spokesman said one line of investigation is why the @entity8 did not refer the case to the watchdog in november 2013 when it first realised the @entity80 unit had failed to pass on the list of names to police forces			1
the @entity8 declined to comment on the latest revelations and instead referred to a statement that it had posted on its website three weeks ago			0
deputy director @entity167 has ordered a review of how the material was handled by @entity80 before the @entity8 took full control in october 2013 .			2

investigators at @entity8 sat on the names of 2,345 suspects
by the time police forces got involved , little action could be taken
the list of names was provided by @entity22 police in july 2012
came after they smashed online store that specialised in indecent images
