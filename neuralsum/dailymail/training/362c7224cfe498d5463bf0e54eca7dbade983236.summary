in a brave and shocking statement about the unobtainable beauty ideals perpetuated by modern media , an artist has allowed the @entity5 transformation of herself to be made into the music video to her first single			1
the haunting video sees @entity10 musician @entity9 , real name @entity11 , singing her song @entity14 as she is altered through post-production in real time			1
starting out make - up free , looking tired and with her hair unstyled , the singer is digitally retouched in front of our eyes , transformed in just a few minutes into a glamorous beauty			2
you can see skin imperfections wiped away at the click of a mouse , and artificial flattering lighting creates the kind of radiant and highlighted skin that women spend thousands trying to achieve , not realising that what they are trying to emulate does not exist in reality			0
shockingly the facial shape is also altered in the video and her right eye is artificially widened before a mirror image of it is created and pasted over her real left eye to create perfect symmetry in the face			2
the teeth are whitened and the lips made fuller and more pink using a program specifically designed to alter parts of the face the computer program can totally change eye colour - allowing the programer to pick from a vast colour palette similarly , hair style , length and colour are all easily manipulable , as if creating a doll once flawless eye make - up has been digitally applied and the hair ' perfected ' , we are left with a woman who , while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals , bears little resemblance to the real artist			2
@entity9 chose to reveal the extent to which celebrities are altered as the video for her song which criticises modern consumerism and urges women to be themselves			1
the song , which is sung in @entity101 , starts with a list of brands and designers such as @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 , before moving onto the refrain which states , ‘ i am not a product			0
’ the chorus declares ‘ of beauty , preciousness ; they can not change me			0
the new fragrance is myself ’ while the third verse states ‘ mascara , blush , lipstick , lipsticks , lip liners , eye shadow , foundation , nail , pressed powder and i do not want it			0
’ flattering lighting and perfect eye make is applied under the new lighting , @entity133 's hair colour is once again changed , scrolling through a range of colours until the perfect shade is found as a final touch , @entity133 's hair is swept to one side and digitally made to look much thicker the video , which has exploded across the web since its release last week , is part of a trend attempting to lift the lid on the lack of reality in celebrity culture and advertising			1
in october , a 36 - second clip , created by @entity151 , showing a relatively average - looking girl turned into a bombshell glamour model , went viral , adding fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding airbrushed models and how they can set unrealistic examples to impressionable young girls			0
a result of this is an increasing backlash against altering images , with @entity163 being the latest brand to release a totally un-airbrushed campaign for its new line of lingerie			0
the debate was reopened this week surrounding the digital retouching of @entity169 for her @entity171 photoshoot ( though it was , many thought , misjudged ) , and increasingly , brands who overuse @entity5 are being ‘ shamed ’ online , with the original images obtained and released as a comparison .			1
