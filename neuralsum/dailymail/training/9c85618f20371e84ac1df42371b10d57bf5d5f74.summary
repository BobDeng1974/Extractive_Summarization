but when a mobile phone went off during a @entity2 performance the conductor saw red , stopping the orchestra in its tracks			2
orchestra music director @entity1 was so appalled by the continuing distraction during one of the most poignant parts of the performance that he brought the musicians to a standstill			0
the phone ’s ' marimba ' ring - tone went off from a front row seat of @entity25 's @entity24 during tuesday night 's performance , according to eyewitnesses			1
