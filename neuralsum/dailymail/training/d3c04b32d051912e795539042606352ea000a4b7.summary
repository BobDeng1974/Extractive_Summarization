by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:01 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 today said his long - awaited @entity4 speech would be worth the wait @entity2 today defended delays to setting out his vision for @entity9 's place in @entity4 , claiming the government 's policy making was like tantric sex and would be worth the wait			1
the prime minister is due to set out his thinking on @entity9 ’s future in @entity4 in a much - delayed speech amid growing agitation in the @entity20 party over the issue			1
@entity23 mayor @entity22 yesterday suggested mr @entity2 is preparing to promise a referendum offering either a new , looser relationship with the @entity26 or a @entity9 exit			1
but the @entity14 insisted he did not want @entity9 to leave the @entity26 , but was determined to secure changes for ' our benefit '			2
speaking to journalists in @entity32 , mr @entity2 said : ' thank you for reminding me that my @entity4 speech is as yet unmade			1
' this is a tantric approach to policy - making			0
it will be even better when it does eventually come ... that was n't in the script ' mr @entity2 went on to say three things were ' happening at the moment ' in @entity4 : ' what i think is right for the country , what i think is politically deliverable and what is deliverable diplomatically			1
' he added : ' i don ; t want @entity9 to leave the @entity26 , i think we benefit crucially from the single market			2
' he said critics needed to ' understand ' what withdrawal would mean , noting how @entity53 is forced to accept instructions from @entity55 over which it has no control			0
mr @entity2 branded it ' government by fax '			2
' i believe @entity9 does have a future in @entity4 , particularly in the heart of the single market			2
it is very important that we are writing the rules of that market rather than just obeying them			0
' big mouth : mayor of london @entity22 revealed that the prime minister is going to announce his ideas for @entity9 's future relationship with the @entity26 and that a referendum is on the cards mr @entity2 will use his speech within weeks to insist he does not think it would be in @entity9 ’s interests to leave the @entity26 but wants to return to a more arms - length , trade - based relationship with @entity55			1
it is ' obvious ' that an independent @entity81 will have to reapply to join the @entity26 , president of the @entity84 @entity83 said today			2
asked if @entity81 would need to reapply to join if it leaves the @entity9 following the referendum in 2014 , he said : ' i did not comment on specific situations of member states because i very much respect that it is their right , their sovereign right to decide about their organisation			0
' now what i said , and it is our doctrine and it is clear since 2004 in legal terms , if one part of a country - i am not referring now to any specific one - wants to become an independent state , of course as an independent state it has to apply to the @entity4 membership according to the rules			2
that is obvious , ' he told the @entity112 's @entity111 programme			0
the @entity32 government insists @entity81 would have to reapply , but the @entity115 government denies this			0
the @entity118 government has vowed to veto admission for a new independent state , fearing the reaction from separatists in @entity123			0
he is expected to set out details of how he wants to renegotiate our membership , repatriating powers in key areas			0
but mr @entity22 , who has discussed plans for a referendum with mr @entity2 , predicted voters would be offered ‘ broadly an in / out referendum on the new terms ’			1
his intervention irritated @entity137 , which has been reluctant to discuss what the prime minister is planning			0
former @entity20 cabinet minister dr @entity140 increased the pressure on the prime minister today , insisting that the party needs a ‘ settled position that is clear , concise and consistent ’			0
‘ the longer we hold a clear position , the more likely we are to be credible and thus to both take advantage of a growing trend amongst the @entity9 electorate and to see off parties such as @entity152 by supplanting them rather than accommodating them , ’ he said in a speech			0
the former defence secretary said public attitudes point towards a ‘ new , looser and largely economic relationship with the @entity26 ’ , adding : ‘ i , for one , hope to see “ back to a common market ” as the @entity20 slogan on @entity4 at the next general election			1
’ ‘ to be frank , if the choice is between the current trajectory towards ever closer union and leaving , then i would choose to leave , albeit reluctantly			0
‘ if the choice is between a looser , more economic relationship and leaving , then i would choose to stay			0
it is a view that , i believe , is gaining ever greater traction with the @entity9 people , ’ he added			0
@entity23 mayor mr @entity22 said yesterday that @entity9 should exploit the eurozone crisis to free itself from key areas of the @entity26 , including fisheries policy , social policy and farming subsidies			1
he agreed with mr @entity2 that an in / out referendum on the current terms of membership was ill - advised , a shift from the position he held earlier this year			1
secret vote : @entity137 has been reluctant to reveal details of prime minister @entity2 's plans for @entity9 's relationship with the @entity26 ‘ if you have a simple in / out referendum i think at the moment the chances are that the @entity9 people would say stuff that for a game of soldiers , and 56 per cent say let ’s pull out , ’ mr @entity22 told @entity188			1
largely economic : @entity140 wants to take the @entity26 ' back to a common market ' ‘ now the risk - and i ’ve been writing about @entity4 for about 25 years , and i spent a long time in @entity55 as a correspondent , and the really good bit about it is the single market -- that ’s something that allows @entity9 firms , @entity9 jobs , @entity9 enterprise to work freely with other @entity4 countries in a way that i think might be in peril if we were to pull out unilaterally			1
‘ so all i ’m saying is let ’s have a renegotiation in which we chop off the bits we do n’t like , chop off all the kind of excrescences likes the fisheries policy and the social chapter or whatever			0
‘ i think probably what @entity2 is going to say , he ’s got some speech coming up , i reckon he is going to commit to a referendum which will be broadly an in / out referendum on the new terms			2
‘ so we ’ve got to go in and get a better deal for @entity9 , which is basically the single market , making sure that @entity9 ministers are in the internal market able to protect @entity9 interests , make sure that @entity9 companies continue to have unfettered access to that market			0
’ mr @entity22 , seen as one of mr @entity2 ’s chief rivals for the @entity20 leadership , repeated his attacks on @entity231 countries for rushing ‘ full tilt towards fiscal union ’			1
as mr @entity2 prepared for a @entity55 summit on @entity231 plans to coordinate banking policy later this week , the mayor predicted such a union would be a ‘ disaster ’ for those countries that join it			1
former @entity243 prime minister @entity242 warned last month that mr @entity2 would be shunned by other @entity26 leaders if he attempted to carve out a special deal for @entity9 in exchange for agreeing to a new @entity231 treaty on political and economic union .			1

@entity2 is due to set out major new policy on @entity4 within weeks
@entity22 predicts he plans a referendum which includes an @entity26 exit
