by @entity1 reporter published : 02:21 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 07:09 est , 26 february 2014 thirty - one of the passengers who were aboard the ill - fated february 2013 @entity7 voyage turned cruise from hell are looking for compensation for their pain and suffering in a civil case that began last week			1
emotions were high in the @entity15 courtroom as passengers took the stand to describe the five days adrift in the @entity18 with very little food , sewage - filled decks and near total darkness at night			1
' i think about the smell , the stench and the bad things			2
all the memories come flooding back , and i ca n't stop them , testified 74 - year - old @entity28 , who like the rest of the plaintiffs says the experience left emotional marks that have remained in the year since the headline - grabbing cruise			2
nightmarish : passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets , feces - covered decks and overpowering stench ' i did not get physically injured			1
i got mentally injured , ' said @entity28 , who suffers from parkinson 's disease and whose husband is diabetic			2
' the whole experience never ends ... it 's over and over again			2
' according to @entity47 , @entity46 district judge @entity45 made a sweeping ruling prior to testimony that @entity7 is indeed responsible for the fire that left the cruise helpless and adrift			1
' it is highly likely that @entity7 was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be ( sic ) attributed			1
here , the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence , ' @entity45 wrote			0
however , the judge also ruled that the passengers , per their agreements with @entity7 , were not guaranteed a safe cruise and therefor the company was not in breach of contract			1
nevertheless , the passengers will continue to testify to the extent of their emotional distress and injuries for at least another week in an attempt to convince the judge they deserve compensation from @entity7			1
those include testimonies like the @entity76 ' , who emphasized an extreme fear of physical injury during the debacle -- not least of all because @entity81 went without his diabetes medication for days -- and other passengers ' with less tangible but far more stomach - turning flirtations with disaster			1
carnival failure ? the @entity7 was anything but after a fire knocked out power and left 3,000 passengers without power , with very little food , and fearing for their lives in some cases suffering after a year : now 31 passengers have filed a civil suit against @entity7 and want compensation for the emotional trauma some of them say they relive even now , a year later like @entity102 , who described having terrible diarrhea on the already feces - covered ship and the distinct lack of usable toilets			1
' there was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one , ' said the 68 - year - old			0
' ( @entity116 ) choked away the smell ... i was fearful , downright afraid and scared			0
' ' i walked through water and feces and urine , no telling what else , ' @entity102 's daugher @entity122 agreed on the stand			0
' we would slip and slide through greasy , gross , slippery muck			0
' like many of the passengers , the @entity127 said they feared they would n't make it home alive from the trip			2
@entity134 - based plaintiff 's attorney @entity132 said each passenger should receive anywhere from $ 30,000 to $ 1 million in compensation , depending on the severity of their injuries			0
' there 's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured , and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this , ' he said in his opening statement			0
@entity15 attorney @entity154 , representing carnival , said the claims of injuries are overblown			0
' there are a number who i believe deserve nothing			0
and i will tell you this , the one or two that i can think of who have significant injuries , they 're very much in the minority and there are only one or two , ' @entity154 said			0
steep : the attorney representing the plaintiffs said they 're asking for between $ 30,000 and $ 1 million for each of the 31 passengers inhumane conditions : passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways			1

31 passengers who were **stranded** aboard the @entity7 in february 2013 are alleging the company is responsible for their suffering
3,000 passengers weer **stranded** for five days aboard the ship without *electricity* , little food , and as sewage flooded decks
a fire knocked out the ships main power , for which a judge has *faulted* the company
but the same judge says @entity7 made no guarantees the voyage would be a safe one and thus was not in breach of contract
