@entity0 is facing a fine of up to £ 4billion as @entity2 prepares to file a high - profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant			1
the @entity5 has been investigating the @entity7 search engine for five years following complaints that it abuses its dominance in the continent - but proceedings have stalled on three previous occasions			1
now the @entity13 , the @entity5 's top antitrust authority , is asking companies who previously filed confidential complaints against @entity0 for permission to publish them , so that officials can begin to build a case against the firm			1
if found to have been behaving unfairly , @entity0 could be fined ten per cent of its annual revenues , which would be more than £ 4 billion based on last year 's performance			1
facing huge fine : @entity0 is facing a fine of up to £ 4billion as @entity2 prepares to file a high - profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant shopping , comparison and travel companies are among those that have been contacted by the @entity5 , @entity28 reports			1
@entity7 companies @entity31 and trip advisor are among those that have filed complaints against @entity0 with the @entity5			1
a decision to file charges would kick start the @entity5 's most prominent antitrust suit since its ten year - long campaign against @entity31 - the firm was forced to pay out more than a £ 1billion in fines in 2012			2
the specific document the @entity5 is said to be preparing is referred to as a statement of objections			0
once filed , it 's likely that a number of deeper investigations , counter-statements , and settlement discussions would ensue			0
if the search engine and the @entity5 can not come to an agreement , then fines could be issued and restrictions placed on @entity0 's behavior			1
leading investigation : new @entity5 antitrust chief @entity55 has suggested she favours pursuing legal action against @entity0 over pushing for a settlement the company would then have the right to appeal the case to the highest @entity2 court			1
even if it is settled without a huge fine , antitrust cases can be hugely disruptive for firm , as @entity31 discovered			0
the @entity13 has also been investigating whether @entity0 has been ' scraping ' content from rivals ' sites , and placing unreasonable restrictions on advertisers and software developers who do business with them			2
a ' preliminary view ' taken by the commission in march 2013 was that @entity0 was abusing its dominant position in a number of areas the company has denied any wrongdoing			0
speaking in @entity85 last week , @entity81 , the company 's senior vice president & general counsel , highlighted the ' painfully long list of unsuccessful @entity0 products ' , including @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 , as proof that competition laws were serving their purpose			2
long - running dispute : former @entity5 antitrust chief @entity95 , above , made three unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dispute between @entity0 and its @entity2 rivals the @entity5 's investigation of complaints that @entity0 abuses its dominance of the online search market to hurt rivals began in 2010			1
the @entity7 company handles more than 90 per cent of web searches in @entity2 - considerably higher than its share of the @entity7 market			0
comparison - shopping sites claim that when consumers use @entity0 to search for products online , @entity0 positions results from @entity114 prominently			2
the argument is that this relegates products from rival sites to positions lower down the search page , where they might not be seen			0
@entity55 , the @entity5 's new antitrust chief , has suggested she will pursue legal action rather than seek a settlement			2
@entity0 and commissioner @entity55 ’s predecessor , @entity95 , made three attempts to resolve the dispute , but in each case intense pressure by national governments , internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort			1
the latest settlement proposed by mr. @entity95 fell apart following a series of interventions by powerful political players , including a letter from the economy ministers of @entity139 and @entity90 calling for greater concessions from @entity0 , and protests from @entity90 publishing houses			0
in november the @entity143 passed a resolution calling for a possible breakup of @entity0 , brushing aside an unusual series of objections from the @entity148 that the move risked politicizing an antitrust investigation			0
ms. @entity55 met a month ago with @entity151 , @entity0 's executive chairman			0
last week , she indicated that her priority was to ensure that smaller @entity154 firms could compete with the industry 's giants .			0

@entity5 has been investigating the @entity7 search giant 's practises for five years
3 previous attempts to settle matter have stalled *due* to political pressure
one complaint is that @entity165 leads users on to the firm 's own sites
*current* case could result in @entity0 being fined 10 *%* of its annual revenues
