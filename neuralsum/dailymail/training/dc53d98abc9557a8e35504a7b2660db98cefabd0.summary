by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 a mother has shared a heartbreaking photo diary of her terminally ill daughter 's life as she vows to make wishes come true for other dying children			1
when @entity9 was told her young daughter , @entity10 , had just months to live , she was determined to fit a lifetime of memories into whatever time they had left together			2
she did n't ask @entity14 to write a bucket list because she did not want her child to know she was dying , so she instead asked the eight - year - old to list all the things she would do if she were the @entity19 – and then secretly set to work making them happen			1
made her dreams come true : @entity9 , pictured with @entity21 , who passed away peacefully in january , says the happy memories of fulfilling @entity14 's wishes give her some comfort @entity21 's wishes included meeting boy band @entity25 , visiting @entity26 and owning her own dog			1
and when she died 10 months later , in january this year , mother of three @entity9 had ticked off all the items on the ' secret bucket list ' without her daughter ever knowing it existed			1
now @entity9 , a dinner lady at @entity14 's old primary school in @entity34 , says that thanks to various charities , she has a lifetime of memories to cherish			1
' my daughter was dying but making all her dreams come true made her so happy and that to me is priceless , ' says @entity9 , 32			1
' asking her to write a bucket list would have been awful so instead i managed to get her to tell me without her knowing how ill she was			1
' shock diagnosis : there was no indication that anything was wrong until @entity21 fainted at school in february 2013 and it was eventually revealed she had an inoperable brain tumour and had only months to live puppy love : the day before her ninth birthday in may , @entity21 was given a dog she named @entity52 there was no indication that anything was wrong until @entity21 fainted at school in february 2013			1
when she came round slurring , staff feared she had suffered a stroke and called an ambulance			0
@entity9 , who was working as a pa at the time , raced to the hospital			2
she says : ' i was terrified but when i got there @entity21 was sat up in @entity66 , laughing and smiling			2
the only thing i noticed was that her speech sounded a bit babyish			0
' doctors at @entity71 decided to run tests and an mri scan came back with devastating results			0
@entity21 had a large tumour on her brain stem which was later found to be cancerous			2
two weeks after @entity14 had fainted , while she lay in a hospital bed surrounded by family , doctors took @entity9 and her mother @entity79 , 76 , into a side room and explained that the tumour was inoperable			1
royal treatment : @entity9 got the chance to meet some of her @entity84 heroes in the months after her diagnosis happy memories : @entity21 , right with her siblings @entity88 , four and @entity89 , three , was delighted by the fact she did n't have to queue up to meet the characters when the family went to @entity93 to fulfill one of her wishes @entity96 pulled together : @entity21 's grandfather paid for the whole family to visit @entity93 in between @entity21 's chemotherapy @entity21 had just months to live			1
@entity9 says : ' i was so shocked i ran outside			2
i just could n't believe what i was hearing			0
but then i composed myself because i needed to get back to @entity102 and make sure she was ok			0
' and that evening , after discussing what to do , @entity9 and @entity21 's stepfather , @entity103 – who are also parents to @entity88 , four and @entity89 , three – decided not to tell @entity21 she was dying			1
@entity9 says : ' @entity21 was a worrier and i could n't put that on her shoulders			1
it would have frightened her			0
' @entity110 pupil : @entity21 continued to go to school because she did n't want to fall behind , especially in her favourite subject maths dream trips : visiting @entity115 's toy - store ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) were two of the things listed by @entity9 instead @entity9 gently explained to @entity14 that she was poorly and the doctors were trying to make her better			1
' she seemed happy with that			0
' but that left @entity9 wanting to make her girl 's dreams come true without asking her to write a bucket list			1
' i realised the only way i could do it would be if i tricked her into making it by asking her what she would do if she could do anything in the world			0
' my heart was breaking because i knew what i was really asking her but @entity21 's face just lit up at the question			2
poignant party : on @entity21 's ninth - and last - birthday she had her dream of an ice - skating party granted heartbreaking decision : @entity9 and her partner chose not to tell @entity21 , pictured here with siblings @entity88 and @entity89 , that she was dying ' i could see her mind racing as she came up with all these wonderful ideas			1
' @entity21 wanted to have an ice - skating birthday party , visit @entity93 and @entity26 , see a @entity145 show , go to the zoo and @entity115 's toy store plus own a dog and rabbit and meet her beloved boy band @entity25			1
while @entity21 started an intensive 30 - session course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try to extend her life , @entity9 quit her job and started fundraising to make her wishes come true			1
she held parties , bake sales , sold wristbands and was nominated for grants from charities who assist families of terminally ill children			1
the first wish to be granted was by one direction who sent a film clip , holding up a message : ' @entity21 , @entity170			2
' it arrived in april , a month after the terminal diagnosis was given			0
animal lover : @entity9 quit her job to help grant her daughter 's wishes , which included going to the zoo strong : @entity9 said she always tried to keep a brave face for @entity14 @entity9 says : ' i tried to arrange a meeting with them but they were on tour and instead offered to do a message			1
i told @entity14 something special was coming in the post			0
she was thrilled when she saw what it was			0
' we watched it in her hospital bed about 500 times			0
she was over the moon that they knew who she was			0
' then the day before her ninth birthday in may , @entity21 was given a @entity197 dog she named @entity52 – another tick			2
@entity9 says : ' she had always wanted one so she could n't stop smiling			2
' the following day another wish came true when she had an ice skating birthday party for her friends			1
' @entity21 was too weak to skate after the first hour and had to be pulled in a sledge on the ice			2
she still loved every minute and was calling out for me to pull her faster			0
brave and beautiful : despite the chemotherapy causing her to gain weight , making her a little self - conscious , @entity9 says @entity21 was happy to have her mother taking pictures of her experiences ' i had to hold back tears but i wanted every minute to be a joy because i knew it was her last birthday , ' says @entity9			1
then @entity21 's grandfather paid for them to visit @entity93			2
@entity9 recalls : ' @entity21 made us laugh because she worked out that as she was in a wheelchair she did n't have to queue to meet the characters			1
she felt like a superstar			0
' @entity14 was taken to @entity222 to see hit show @entity223 ! and the following month they took @entity225 to @entity26			0
@entity227 fun : in december last year the family took @entity21 to visit @entity229 and meet @entity230 , granting her last wish loss : @entity9 has taken comfort from the happiness of her daughter 's last months legacy : @entity9 is now launching a charity - @entity236 - to help all terminally ill children 's dreams come true @entity9 says : ' she had lost a bit of hair and had started to gain weight because of her chemotherapy and was feeling self - conscious			1
but @entity21 was still happy for me to take lots of pictures			2
' in between the wishes @entity14 continued to go to school because she did n't want to fall behind , especially in her favourite subject , maths			0
' i did n't have the heart to tell her it did n't matter any more			0
it mattered to @entity14 so she kept going , ' says @entity9			0
between june and october she had a second course of chemo and in december last year they visited @entity229 to meet @entity230			0
but after @entity257 the child 's health went rapidly downhill			0
and when in early january she complained that she felt too poorly to go to school , @entity9 knew the end was coming			1
she says : ' @entity21 never wanted to miss school - but she still insisted on going to buy me a present even though my birthday was a month away			1
it made me wonder if she knew			0
' but soon she was in pain so nurses came and fitted a morphine drip			0
' days later @entity21 died at home , holding her mother 's hand			1
@entity9 took comfort in the happiness of her daughter 's last months			0
she says : ' the memories we made are what get me through each day			0
@entity88 and @entity89 miss her			0

@entity14 's wishes made her happy - and as a parent of a dying child that is all you can ask for			2
