it looks unlike any other skyscraper ever designed - and appears at first glance to be wearing a giant wig			0
however , experts say this bizarre design could be the future of high rise buildings			0
the ' hairs ' are in fact thin fibres that convert movement as they are blown about into energy , taking advantage of the winds on the higher levels of the building			1
an artist 's impression of the ' hairy skyscraper ' planned for @entity21			1
the ' hairs ' are in fact thin fibres that convert movement into energy as they are blown by the wind the straws of the facade consist of a composite material with piezoelectric properties that can turn motion into electrical energy			1
@entity33 is created when certain crystals ’ deformation is transformed into electricity			0
the technique has advantages when compared to traditional wind turbines since it is quite and does not disturb wildlife			2
it functions at low wind velocity since only a light breeze is sufficient for the straws to start swaying and generate energy			1
the plans have been created by @entity47 , who called the project ' @entity48 '			0
the new tower is designed to be built on top of a building in the centre of the city			2
' @entity47 wants to give @entity56 its original proportions and at the same time explore new techniques that could create the urban wind farm of the future , ' the firm says			2
' by using piezoelectric technology , a large number of thin straws can produce electricity merely through small movements generated by the wind			1
' the result is a new kind of wind power plant that opens up possibilities of how buildings can produce energy			1
' with the help of this technique surfaces on both old and new buildings can be transformed into energy producing entities			0
' the plans also include a top floor restaurant where diners can peer out between the ' straws ' the firm says the bizarre coating can even be used as a tourist attraction			0
' the constant movement of the straws creates an undulating landscape on the facades			0
' what is usually considered to be the most static of all things , the building , suddenly comes alive and the construction gives the impression of a body that is breathing			0
' the straws swaying in the wind gives the building a constantly changing facade further reinforced at nighttime with lighting in changing colors			1
' the facade can be lit up at night using different coloured led lights			2

building planed for @entity21 could be a blueprint for rest of the *world*
*covered* in thin ' straws ' that produce energy as they are moved by the wind
the straws can be lit up at night
