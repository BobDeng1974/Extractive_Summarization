by @entity0 published : 16:25 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 30 april 2013 the @entity1 pays almost £ 1billion a year to cover the healthcare costs of @entity1 who fall ill on the continent – but receives only a fraction of that for @entity8 treatment of @entity10 visitors			1
official figures show that last year taxpayers handed £ 903.4million to @entity10 governments and insurance providers to pay for the care of @entity1			1
but the @entity8 managed to collect only £ 48.7million from the same @entity10 countries to pay for the care of their citizens who fall ill here			1
health secretary @entity20 promised to ' shake up the system ' to ensure fairness it means that for every £ 18 the @entity1 sends to @entity10 to pay for healthcare , it gets only £ 1 back			1
the figures underline how ineffective @entity8 hospitals are at clawing back money they are owed compared with those in @entity10 , amid claims that ‘ health tourism ’ costs @entity1 taxpayers billions a year			1
many @entity8 trusts do not even keep records of debt			0
health secretary @entity20 promised to make hospitals improve			1
‘ our @entity8 processes to collect money from visitors are n’t good enough , ’ he said			0
‘ that is why we are going to radically shake up the system to ensure we get fairness			1
’ earlier this month cancer specialist professor j @entity42 warned of a ‘ massive and escalating problem ’ of foreigners travelling to @entity1 for cancer , @entity49 , kidney and infertility treatment , then leaving without paying			2
he said the @entity8 was also becoming the ‘ world ’s maternity wing ’ as expectant mothers arrive just to give birth without paying			0
experts have warned of @entity10 travelling to the @entity1 to get free treatment for cancer , @entity49 , kidney and infertility treatment some of the disparity in the figures , obtained with a @entity60 request , is because more @entity1 pensioners retire to the continent than those from the @entity64 here			1
igures were not available to show the overall number of @entity10 visitors to the @entity1 compared with @entity1 going abroad			1
but there are 1.4million migrant workers from the @entity64 here , against 330,000 @entity1 employed in other @entity10 countries			2
in 2011/12 , the @entity1 paid @entity72 £ 368million for treating @entity1 who fell ill there , but only £ 23million came back the other way			1
some £ 247million was paid to @entity75 , but just £ 3.2million came back			2
@entity76 received £ 197million and returned £ 6.3million			0
@entity77 got £ 11million and sent back £ 850,000 , and @entity78 collected £ 8million and returned £ 500,000			2
@entity79 , of the think - tank 2020health , said : ‘ the fact that the @entity8 fails to keep proper records of overseas visitors who come here from the @entity64 is indicative of two problems : the reluctance of staff to think of the @entity8 as a business that should be run as efficiently as possible , and a system which depends on governments chasing reimbursement , rather than visitors paying up front			0
’ @entity95 , of the @entity96 ’ @entity94 , said : ‘ this is an incredible amount of taxpayers ’ money leaving the @entity8 at a time when budgets are tight			0
it ’s vital that checks are in place			0
’ the @entity105 highlighted the issue of pensioners			0
those who retire on the continent are classed as ‘ non-permanent residents ’ , meaning @entity64 countries can claim payment for their healthcare			0
the department said : ‘ the @entity8 is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system			0
‘ last year we began a review to address concerns about access , cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so			2
we are looking at a range of proposals			0

we pay £ 903.4m to cover the healthcare costs of @entity1 abroad
but , we only receive £ 48.7m back to pay for @entity10 who fall ill here
