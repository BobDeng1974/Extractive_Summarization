@entity2 thoroughbreds @entity0 and @entity3 led the @entity5 charge on sunday at the @entity6			1
four - time winner @entity0 impressed with a 10 - 5 first - round victory over @entity8 , and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago			1
the 39 - year - old fired breaks of 77 , 75 , 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against @entity16 potter @entity8 , who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed			1
@entity0 plays a shot during his match against @entity8 during the @entity21 @entity8 said of his conqueror : ' it 's going to take a good man to beat him on that form			1
' he 's playing really good stuff			2
i think i did well to get five frames			2
' @entity3 , unseeded this year but a proven @entity2 class act and champion in 2006 , was a 10 - 8 winner earlier as he ousted @entity32			1
@entity0 has sprung back to competitive form level this year , notably in taking the @entity35 title in february to end a two - and - a - half - year major trophy drought			1
he had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over , but @entity0 is daring to dream of a fifth world title			1
he said : ' i 'm feeling relief and pride to beat @entity8 because he 's a dangerous player			1
i knew i 'd lost my last four matches to him			2
' i thought i hit the ball well			2
i missed a few but i felt good in amongst them			2
' asked directly whether he was a potential champion , @entity0 initially said : ' nah			1
there 's more and more contenders out there			0
i probably know what it takes to win it but there 's more favoured players than me			1
' but the desire is there , and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy			0
@entity0 added : ' it would be amazing if i could win it and go level with somebody like @entity63 on five titles			2
that would be beyond my wildest dreams			0
the fire is still there			0
' i 've had a few sleepless nights thinking i 'd never get back into the winners ' circle			0
luckily it happened at the @entity35 and that 's given me a bit of a boost			0
' you doubt yourself definitely , especially in dark times , but now hopefully there 's some good times			0
' just to win this again would be incredible			0
@entity63 has probably outstripped me , winning more tournaments and making more century breaks , and he 's obviously chasing @entity84 's records			0
' but there 's perhaps @entity84 , @entity63 and ( @entity87 ) @entity86 before me winning most			0
if it 's just those three ahead of me i ca n't complain			0
it 's not a bad three to have in front of you			0
' @entity3 plays a shot during his match against @entity32 during the @entity21			1

@entity0 beats @entity8 10 - 5 to reach second round
@entity0 says he would love to *challenge* for @entity97 again
but the 39 - year - old admits there are many more favoured players
@entity3 sees off @entity32 10 - 8
