it was on december 21 – the day @entity1 began their unbeaten run – that a bloke dressed as @entity4 held a sign at @entity6 that read : ' @entity7 , i 've got your back ! ' yet divine intervention has nothing to do with it			1
it is @entity14 that has resurrected @entity1 by throwing out the old system and implementing the new			1
tactics in football can be as precarious as a game of rock , paper , scissors			2
nothing is guaranteed , and there is always a risk , but @entity1 have found a way to expose others and not themselves			2
a man dressed as @entity4 was spotted at @entity6 during @entity1 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity30 in december @entity1 's unbeaten run in the @entity32 began on december 21 at @entity6 in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity30 @entity1 's bandaged - up defender @entity34 ( right ) celebrates scoring against @entity30 as the run began the turning point was at @entity37 on december 14 when @entity14 finally released his grasp on 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
they lost 3 - 0 in their 3 - 4 - 3 experiment , but that by no means tells the story			1
just 25 seconds separated the excellent @entity43 's save from @entity44 at one end , and @entity47 's opening goal for @entity48 at the other			2
@entity50 , the linesman , failed to recognise @entity51 was more than a yard offside when he made it two			0
a defensive error by @entity55 created the third			0
@entity1 were torn apart by preventable goals			2
the visitors got into scoring positions more frequently , having 19 shots to @entity48 's 11 , but lacked a cutting edge			0
at least they were n't as cramped as they were against @entity64 the week before ( shown below , left ) , where right - back @entity65 ( no 2 ) drifted inside and @entity44 ( no 31 ) led the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation			1
dec 06 - @entity1 0 - 0 @entity69 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 dec 09 - @entity1 1 - 1 @entity64 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 dec 14 - @entity48 3 - 0 @entity1 - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 17 - @entity70 1 - 3 @entity1 - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 21 - @entity1 2 - 2 @entity30 - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 26 - @entity71 0 - 1 @entity1 - 3 - 4 - 3 @entity1 played 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 against @entity64 on dec 9 ( left ) with right - back @entity65 ( no 2 ) drifting inside and @entity44 ( no 31 ) up front ... but they switched to 3 - 4 - 3 against @entity48 on dec 14 ( right ) @entity44 sees his shot saved by @entity48 goalkeeper @entity43 at @entity37 on december 14 it took just 25 seconds for @entity48 to go up the other end for @entity47 to score the opener ( pictured ) @entity48 's @entity51 was offside by more than a yard but the goal counted as the linesman failed to notice @entity51 runs away in celebration while @entity81 , having replaced @entity82 , looks towards the linesman @entity1 's average positions in their latest win against @entity71 shows they still play 3 - 4 - 3 even though @entity1 were hit for three by @entity48 , they persisted with 3 - 4 - 3 in the next game against @entity70 in the @entity87 quarter - final , and have done since			1
it 's helped them get 29 points since @entity90 , while @entity91 rivals @entity92 have just 28 in total for the season			1
just look at their 2 - 0 win against @entity71 on wednesday , for example ( shown right )			1
@entity97 ( no 23 ) dropped into the back three			0
@entity98 ( no 18 ) , a left - back with a winger 's soul , was pushed forward			2
@entity102 ( no 24 ) and @entity103 ( no 14 ) owned central midfield in tandem , and the three - pronged attack featuring @entity44 ( no 31 ) , @entity107 ( no 15 ) and the indispensable @entity108 ( no 10 ) worked			2
they 're fast , they swarm , they press , they move			0
it 's not rocket science , yet it leaves teams bewildered			0
fit - again @entity107 started on wednesday rather than @entity44 being used in the middle , as he had been against @entity117 and @entity118			0
easing @entity107 back in , as is only natural after an injury that cost five months			0
possession too , it seems , is no longer nine - tenths of the law			0
@entity117 had 51 per cent against @entity1 at @entity6 , yet lost 2 - 1			1
@entity118 had 60 per cent , and lost 2 - 0			1
as was the case with @entity125 , @entity126 , and so on			0
@entity127 pictured doing keepie uppies during @entity1 's training session at @entity130 on friday @entity127 runs with the ball as he looks to help his team continue their fine form following his injury @entity1 have claimed 29 points since @entity90 , while rivals @entity92 have 28 in total for the season @entity1 manager @entity14 made the switch from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 to 3 - 4 - 3 on december 14 and it 's worked ' we have restructured the team and organised the team in a different way , ' @entity14 said last month , ' to get that solidity back and get the balance back both offensively and defensively			1
' it sounded like one of those generic responses that roll off managers ' tongues , but there was more to this			0
@entity82 was dropped for goalkeeper @entity81 against @entity48 , but returned to the first team on @entity155			2
since then , @entity1 have conceded the least ( 6 ) in the @entity32 and have the best goal difference ( +15 )			1
no surprise , then , that a table since december 26 puts them top ( 29 points ) ahead of @entity30 ( 27 ) and , remarkably , @entity160 ( 23 )			1
@entity82 makes a save during @entity1 's comfortable 2 - 0 win over @entity71 at @entity6 on wednesday night @entity82 was dropped for @entity81 against @entity48 in december , but returned to the first team on @entity155 yet should we expect anything less ? @entity14 has a knack for upping the ante , after all			1
in 2012 - 13 , @entity1 averaged 1.47 points per game between august and december , rising to 2.5 between january and may			1
in 2013 - 14 , they went from 1.89 to 2.53			0
and this year , they have gone from 1.47 to 2.56			0
only @entity169 ( 2.67 ) better that out of every club in the @entity32 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , yet @entity1 have played three more games			1
and if they maintain their 2.56 average , @entity1 would end up with 77 points – enough for them to qualify for the @entity178 in nine out of the past 10 years			1
@entity107 scores against @entity71 at @entity6 on wednesday night as he gets back to full fitness the return of @entity107 following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps but he has been eased in @entity107 started against @entity71 but began on the bench against @entity117 and @entity118 the return of @entity107 following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps			0
without him , they average 1.3 goals per game , 1.5 points and their win percentage is a measly 42.1			1
with him , it rises to 1.9 goals , 2.4 points and 77.8 per cent			0
who needs @entity195 ? or @entity127 , for that matter			0
@entity103 has captained @entity1 eight times in the @entity32 since november 29 , winning seven and drawing one			1
they have scored 15 goals and conceded just twice when the hard - working deputy wears the armband			0
no other captain in the @entity32 has a better win percentage than him ( 88 )			2
a natural , it would seem			0
even @entity206 , when not injured , provides cover for the back three as a defensive midfielder			0
@entity14 has a man for every occasion , and it 's clicking at the right time			1
@entity127 led @entity1 to @entity178 glory against @entity212 in 2005 but is leaving for the @entity213 soon @entity103 has been in inspired form for @entity1 and struck sensational goals in his last two games @entity103 has led the team in @entity127 's absence as @entity1 have made a charge for the top four if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it			1
their luck with 3 - 4 - 3 – arguably 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 on occasion – may well run out , because imperfections will always be there			1
the price of failing to qualify for the @entity178 ? some £ 31.3million , give or take – not including the prize money – and the unwanted consolation of @entity230 football			2
trouble is , their new system is no secret			0
others will try to copy or stump them , and @entity14 must anticipate it			2
in 210 minutes against @entity237 in two @entity87 semi-final legs , after all , @entity1 scored just once and were eliminated			2
it 's so far , so good			0
all this will matter little if they do n't beat @entity48 on march 22 , or @entity30 on april 4 , or do better against @entity237 on may 9			2
ripping up the blueprint in mid-december was a start			0
time for the finish .			0

@entity1 remain unbeaten in the @entity32 since 3 - 0 loss at @entity37
@entity14 changed to a 3 - 4 - 3 formation from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 in @entity248
the @entity1 manager has persisted with the new system since , and they have got 29 points since @entity90 while @entity92 have 28 for the entire season
a @entity32 table since @entity155 puts @entity1 top ahead of @entity30
only @entity169 ( 2.67 ) have a better points - per - game average than @entity1 ( 2.56 ) in @entity261 's top five *leagues* in that time period
if @entity1 maintain their 2.56 average , their projected 77 points would have been enough to qualify for the @entity178 in nine out of past 10 years
@entity1 face @entity267 on *sunday* in the @entity269 quarter - final
