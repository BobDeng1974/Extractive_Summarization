by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 14:38 est , 15 november 2012 the @entity1 will use this year 's @entity2 to address the @entity3 - but will not mention the disgraced presenter by name			1
@entity1 executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its flagship annual charity fundraising programme which airs on friday			0
the appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six weeks			0
the @entity3 revelations and the fallout from the shelved @entity29 report about the late @entity30 'll fix it star will inevitably cast a shadow over this year 's six - hour fundraiser on @entity35 and @entity36			1
the @entity1 said the programme would be ' even bigger and better than ever ' with guests including @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 stars and sir @entity44 , who will appear in a special edition of @entity47			0
@entity1 sources told @entity49 the programme would make reference to ' recent events that have been covered in the press ' but it is not expected to specifically mention @entity54			1
the appeal will also carry a film reflecting the work of charities that help the victims of abuse			1
' there will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered in the @entity64 quite extensively , ' said a @entity1 insider			1
' it will also say that @entity2 does and always has supported children who were the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that these charities do			1
scandal : @entity54 appeared on the telethon in 1984 , 1987 and 1989 last year the charity fundraising event chalked up a record £ 46million @entity18 ( left ) will be joined by @entity1 presenters @entity75 , @entity76 ( right ) and new radio 1 breakfast dj @entity77 ' there will be a film to reflect that , and there was one on the same subject last year			1
' sir @entity84 , the former chairman of @entity2 , revealed last month that @entity54 was secretly banned from the @entity2 appeal for being ‘ creepy ’			2
though still revered elsewhere at the corporation , the presenter was kept away from the annual fundraiser because of ' rumours ' of his interest in young girls			0
@entity54 appeared on the telethon in 1984 , 1987 and 1989 , before sir @entity84 became chairman			2
a member of the board of governors between 1996 and 2002 , sir @entity84 said he would have stepped down from his charity role if @entity54 had become involved			2
the @entity1 has also suffered a slump in trust among licence - fee payers as a result of the @entity3 scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate @entity29 report about an alleged child abuser , which led to the resignation of director general @entity107 on saturday			0
the former judge who is leading a @entity1 inquiry into the @entity54 sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses			2
dame @entity113 , who is reviewing the corporation 's practices during the @entity116 years , has called on potential victims , witnesses , people who worked with the tv presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with the investigation			2
according to the inquiry 's website , the review also wants to hear from people ' who were familiar with the culture or practices of the @entity1 ' in terms of ' preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children , young people or teenagers '			2
@entity54 became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a @entity136 1 dj and presenter of @entity30 'll fix it on @entity35			0
he worked for the @entity1 between 1964 and approximately 2007 , according to the review 's website			0
but @entity54 , who died last year at the age of 84 , is now believed to have been one of the @entity144 's most prolific abusers , with hundreds of possible victims			1
a @entity147 poll published on tuesday found that for the first time since it began tracking support for @entity144 institutions in 2003 , more respondents distrust @entity1 journalists ( 47 per cent ) than trust them ( 44 per cent )			0
@entity147 reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in @entity1 journalism the past fortnight – suggesting the corporation 's reputation has been harmed more by the inaccurate @entity29 report and @entity107 's resignation than by earlier revelations about @entity54			2
@entity1 insiders said @entity54 would be the ' elephant in the room ' during this year 's appeal , but people working on the show stressed that it would be ' business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the viewers really enjoy it '			1
a former chairman of @entity2 , sir @entity84 , said last month that the charity had made a decision to keep @entity54 away from the event because he had suspicions about the @entity178 presenter			0
@entity84 , a former @entity1 governor for @entity179 , said he always felt @entity54 was a ' pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we did n't want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child protection policies , which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything '			0
@entity18 will be joined by @entity1 presenters @entity75 , @entity76 and new radio 1 breakfast dj @entity77			0
this year 's appeal will be executive produced by @entity190			1
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' our aim this year , like every year , is to raise as much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help change lives of disadvantaged children across the @entity144			0
' @entity2 has a strong track record of funding projects with a specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk of , or have experienced , some form of sexual abuse			0
' on friday night , the show will feature a number of films based on the work we fund to help disadvantaged children and young people in the @entity144 , this will include some of our work helping the victims of sexual abuse , as was the case last year			1
' last year 's @entity2 , featuring bandaged mascot @entity216 , raised £ 46million , taking to more than £ 650million the amount of money it has generated since its first broadcast in 1980			1
@entity39 have recorded this year 's @entity2 single , @entity221			1
friday night 's programme will also feature special editions of @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 , and @entity22 the dog , winner of @entity231 's @entity144 's @entity230 , meeting his @entity2 namesake .			0
