this teenage girl has fulfilled an amphibious ambition after becoming @entity3 's first professional mermaid			0
@entity4 , 19 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , built her own 6 ft tail and trained for four hours a day to turn herself into a full - time half - woman half - fish performer			1
the former model now specialises in so - called mer - modelling , mer - acting and performing other related mer - entertainment			1
@entity12 , 19 , pictured at @entity13 near @entity14 in @entity6 , is @entity3 's first professional mermaid she created the scaly outfit by laboriously stitching together old swimsuits to create a glittery skirt and fin - and has even died her hair red to resemble her idol @entity21 , @entity22			1
after leaving college she launched herself as a professional mermaid and makes a living from children 's parties , modelling and special events such as promoting clean beaches			2

' i watched videos and looked at pictures , and was amazed at how realistic and graceful they are			0
' i have always being interested in mythical creatures			0
when i was younger i wanted to be a fairy			0
@entity4 makes a living as a mermaid by mer - modelling , mer - acting and other related mer - entertainment @entity4 has already had several modelling jobs and children 's parties , but is looking to expand her repertoire ' but making a fairy costume did n't seem practical			1
i could make some wings that looked really lifelike but they would never be able to fly			0
' with a mermaid tail i would actually be able to swim like a mermaid			2
' i was n't sure it would work in the water			0
but once i had made it i tried it out and was amazed at how well it worked			0
' @entity4 used her arts and crafts skills to sow together @entity60 swimsuits sealed them with silicone bonding to make her tail			1
the @entity65 tail worked perfectly and she spent the summer learning to dive , swim and hold her breath underwater to emulate @entity69 's @entity21			2
@entity4 said she grew up obsessed with fantasy creatures and fairies but decided against becoming a @entity73 impersonator - because she would n't be able to fly			1
the teen , who recently completed a foundation degree at @entity76 , said : ' swimming in the tail takes time to master and it can feel like you 're sinking at times - but it 's faster and i 'm becoming better and better at it			1
' ultimately i want to raise awareness of keeping the seas clean and safe for marine animals			0
i want to use this as a platform for doing good			0
' i want to educate children about sea pollution in a way that 's fun so they will enjoy it and learn at the same time			0
' @entity4 's biggest inspiration was @entity91 , a famous aquatic performer from the @entity92 who glides through the water thanks to a bespoke £ 3,500 tail			1
