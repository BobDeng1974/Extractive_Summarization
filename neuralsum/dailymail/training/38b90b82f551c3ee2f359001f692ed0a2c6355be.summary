@entity1 ’s players have been warned they will receive a verbal lashing from @entity4 captain @entity3 if any of them try diving to win a penalty			1
@entity3 witnessed the @entity1 performance branded ‘ @entity12 ’ by @entity9 manager @entity8 and is not afraid to deliver personal rebukes to offenders			1
head coach @entity13 also added his voice to the debate , calling for the @entity16 to take retrospective action on simulation			2
it is a crime , he believes , on par with red - card tackles because ‘ it can cost you the game ’			1
@entity3 will given a stern talking to any @entity1 players who try to dive to win a penalty @entity3 was unfortunate to suffer play - off heartbreak with @entity4 last season after an outstanding season @entity1 centre back @entity30 ( centre ) was not booked for this dive against @entity9 on saturday kick - off : 7.45pm @entity34			1
tv : @entity36 1 from 7.30pm			2
referee : @entity38 @entity1 travel to the @entity34 for tuesday ’s @entity40 quarter - final on the back of stinging criticism from @entity8 , who was infuriated when @entity30 escaped a second yellow card for a tumble in the box			1
the match at @entity47 saw @entity48 and @entity49 booked for diving by referee @entity51 and it is an issue @entity4 are familiar with as far as @entity1 are concerned			1
the two teams met in january for an @entity54 third round tie and @entity55 received a yellow card for simulation from @entity58			2
earlier this season when @entity59 went down in the area , @entity3 stood over the @entity63 winger to administer a firm censure			1
expect the @entity4 defender to do the same to @entity1 ’s stellar collection of talents			1
‘ i stick up for my team - mates , i stick up for the club , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ @entity59 went over quite easy in the box and i let him know it was n’t acceptable			2
as a player it is quite frustrating			1
‘ players are going to do it unless their manager stamps it out			2
it will be a touchy subject for as long as it carries on			2
you do n’t want fellow professionals to cheat			0
' i do n’t know if cheat is the right word , it is one of those things that happens in football that we want to see less of			0
@entity89 wants diving incidents which go unnoticed to be investigated by authorities afterwards @entity92 has led @entity1 to the top of the @entity94 after a excellent opening half to the season ‘ the referee is the key to it			1
he has to be strong			0
it is such a tough decision because the pace of the game means things happen so quickly			2
players ca n’t argue if they have blatantly dived and get booked — it is not right			0
’ @entity13 wants diving incidents that go undetected to be studied by authorities afterwards			0
‘ if people cheat and do wrong , they have to suffer the consequences , we ’ve all had to do that , ’ he said			0
‘ ( @entity115 analysis ) should be ( used ) , they do it in other things so why not for diving or simulation ? ‘ it keeps getting mentioned for years now and still nothing ’s been done			0
it ’s in our game and it needs to be stamped out			2
we try to do it as managers and coaches , but it ’s up to referees and the authorities to take the action we ca n’t take			0
’ @entity13 coaches his defenders about the perils of going to ground in the box			0
‘ it ’s what we call the red zone			0
it ’s danger ! do n’t give the opponent the opportunity to fall over or catch your foot			0
’ @entity142 hopes the match will be decided without controversy			2
he believes @entity1 have improved hugely since the sides met nearly a year ago			1
following that crushing play - off final defeat at @entity147 , @entity4 have topped the @entity148 at stages this season but sit third after losing to @entity151 on saturday			1
a @entity40 run is a positive , but promotion to the @entity94 is the big prize			1
@entity155 and @entity92 share a joke on the touchline at the @entity34 during last year 's @entity54 clash @entity3 added : ‘ it is going to be a good benchmark to see how far we have come since we played them in january			1
' as a squad i think we have really matured			0
it is going to be a great test but this is why you are in football , to test yourself against the best			0
we are striving to play against this calibre of team every week			0
‘ from a year ago they have improved immensely			0
@entity92 ’s addressed the areas he thought were a problem , up front and then ( @entity177 ) @entity176 and ( @entity179 ) @entity178 in midfield : so strong mentally and physically			1
we did a video on the weaknesses on their team and it lasted about five seconds			0
‘ they are the best team in the @entity94 and arguably the best team in @entity186			0
‘ we have to perform at our best to stay in the game and have a chance of achieving our dream result			2
' i want to see how our players perform — have we moved on from a year ago ? because @entity1 have			1
‘ @entity92 will respect us			1
that will reflect in the team he picks			0
we do n’t expect any favours			0
