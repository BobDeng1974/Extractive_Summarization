all but one of 10 former @entity2 public school educators convicted in a widespread conspiracy to inflate student scores on standardized tests were sentenced to jail time on tuesday , as the judge called the cheating scandal ' the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town			1
' @entity12 superior court judge @entity11 had delayed sentencing by a day and encouraged all to negotiate deals with prosecutors			1
but only two agreed to deals			1
in both those cases , @entity11 followed the state 's recommendations : he gave a former teacher a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew at home for one year and a former testing coordinator six months of weekends spent in jail			1
they 'll also serve five years on probation			1
he called the cheating scandal ' the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town ' defense attorney @entity37 holds her hand on her client , former @entity2 public school teacher @entity39			1
she was the only one of the accused to avoid jail after she took a plea deal and was sentenced to 5 years , with 1 year of home confinement and curfew despite their lawyers ' pleas for probation and community service , the remaining eight received harsher sentences , ranging from one to seven years in jail			1
they are expected to appeal and will be free on bond while the appeals are pending			0
a state investigation found that as far back as 2005 , educators from the 50,000 - student @entity2 school system fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in			1
evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved , and teachers who tried to report it were threatened with retaliation			1
in 2013 , 35 educators were indicted on charges including racketeering , making false statements and theft			1
many pleaded guilty before the trial , and some testified at the months - long trial			0
the jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who went to trial and convicted the other 11 of racketeering			1
' this was very , very remarkable , to have the judge sort of give the defendants a second chance , ' said @entity85 law professor emeritus @entity84			1
' the thing that maybe was a little surprising was the reticence of the defendants to step forward and do that			1
' former testing coordinator @entity90 was one of only two accused to took a plea deal			1
he was sentenced to 5 years probation , 6 months of weekends in jail , a $ 5000 fine and 1500 hours of community service former @entity2 public school teacher @entity96 was sentenced to two years in prison , three years probation , 1,500 hours of community service and a $ 5,000 fine @entity100 , who represented former elementary school principal @entity101 , said the decision to turn down the deal was n't hard for his client			1
' she could n't say something that was n't true , ' he said , referring to the insistence by the prosecution and the judge that the negotiated deals include an acceptance of responsibility			1
those who took the deals — former teacher @entity39 and former testing coordinator @entity90 — waived their right to appeal			1
they also agreed to accept responsibility , reading aloud a statement apologizing to students , parents and the court			2
@entity122 , @entity123 's lawyer , said his client is relieved and wants to move on with his life			2
' he 's a man of @entity125 and he knows that sometimes to be a man of @entity125 you have to humble yourself , ' @entity122 said			2
@entity11 eventually agreed to let all the defendants qualify for first - offender status , after initially denying it for some			1
that means their records can be wiped clean once they 've completed their sentences			2
former @entity2 public school @entity136 , left , and @entity138 , right , were both sentenced to seven years in prison , 13 years probation , 2,000 hours of community service and a $ 25,000 fine @entity2 public school educator @entity142 , left , was sentenced to two years in prison , three years probation , 1,500 hours of community service and a $ 5,000 fine misconduct by educators rarely ends up in criminal court , and the fact that so many of them received jail time sends a strong message , @entity84 said			1
' these sentences will send shockwaves through the world of education , ' he said , adding that he believes it will be nearly impossible going forward for an administrator to pressure a teacher to cheat			2
when sentencing those who did n't take a deal , @entity11 reserved the harshest punishment for three regional directors who oversaw multiple schools and were ' at the very top of this scandal			1
' for them , @entity11 went above prosecutors ' recommendations of three years imprisonment			1
he ordered them to serve seven years in prison with the remainder of a 20 - year sentence on probation , 2,000 hours of community service and a $ 25,000 fine			2
during sentencing , @entity11 called the cheating ' pervasive			1
' ' it 's like the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town , ' he said			1
former @entity2 public school srt director @entity182 was sentenced to seven years on tuesday , while @entity184 received a one year jail term former superintendent @entity186 was among those indicted , but she did not stand trial because her lawyers argued successfully that she was too sick			1
she died last month from complications of breast cancer			0
the 11th convicted former educator had a baby over the weekend and will be sentenced later			2
district attorney @entity195 told reporters after sentencing that his goal all along was to get the community to pay attention to what happened in @entity2 schools and to make sure the affected children get some relief			1
' we believe the loss that we suffered was a community loss , ' @entity195 said			0
he said his office is in talks to create the @entity209 , which he said will seek to identify and assess the students who were hurt by the cheating scandal and to provide solutions for them , including help getting a job or ged training or assistance getting into college			1
@entity219 , daughter of slain civil rights icon @entity221 , and rev. @entity223 , a former administrator at @entity224 and the @entity225 , have been tapped to head the board of the planned academy , @entity195 said			0
