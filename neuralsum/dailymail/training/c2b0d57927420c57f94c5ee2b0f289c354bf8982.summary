@entity14 , who lives just outside @entity15 , @entity16 , sabotaged the app by rewriting computer code that prevents users from uploading videos more than six seconds long			1
the cheeky teenager chose the @entity4 clip which is used in a widespread online joke known as @entity24 , where internet users are unwittingly redirected to a web page playing the video			2
@entity14 immediately took to @entity3 posting : ' i think i just broke @entity10 ' , before adding : ' i truly feel awful for the engineers whose day i ruined with my stupid messing around			1
' the young prankster , who said he has been programming for a few years , said it had taken him less than an hour to rewrite the application			0
he only found out that it was successful , when someone retweeted the video which he 'd posted from his account			0
he told @entity39 : ' i noticed something a little funny about how they were doing uploads a little different than how most do			0
' i actually reverse engineered how that app works			2
i figured out how the app talks to the server			0
' i was mortified because i was afraid that the engineers would be called out looking kind of silly			0
' @entity14 later apologised to @entity3 engineers for the trouble he caused but when asked if he might perform another @entity24 , he refused to rule it out .			1

@entity57 sabotaged @entity10 's @entity8 app on the day of its release
