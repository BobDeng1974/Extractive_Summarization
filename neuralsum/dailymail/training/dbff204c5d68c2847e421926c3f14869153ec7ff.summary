@entity1 players were put through their paces by @entity3 on saturday as they looked to put an unsatisfactory week behind them with victory against @entity5			1
the @entity6 were beaten 3 - 1 at home by @entity8 in the @entity9 in midweek , all - but - ending their aspirations in @entity11 this season			1
and they looked focused at @entity14 ahead of the @entity16 fixture with @entity5 on sunday			1

@entity37 and @entity38 could also return to action soon			0
@entity3 is open to embracing change and can turn the team into an effective defensive force again , according to former double winner @entity43			2
the manner of the performance against @entity8 - which saw @entity1 punished on the break for what @entity3 himself described as ' suicidal defending ' - drew plenty of negative headlines and debate across social media , with @entity43 calling for support of the manager and unity behind the team			1
@entity43 , who was in goal when @entity1 battled to the @entity58 and @entity59 success , believes @entity3 still has what it takes to find the balance needed to blend the attack - minded squad into an effective unit			2

' i believe this squad has the potential to challenge the likes of @entity95 and @entity96 , for all of their salaries and transfer fees			0
' this @entity1 squad are right on the brink			0
' @entity3 has assembled a squad which is now nearly perfect , there are virtually two players in every position and going forwards they have an embarrassment of riches			0
' we just have to make sure victory is based on good defence			0
' @entity3 's principles are to always entertain and play this beautiful football to watch , but you need to make sure your defence is always secure , and that involves everybody from the goalkeeper out , so as soon as you lose possession every one of you becomes a defender immediately and have to win the ball back			2
