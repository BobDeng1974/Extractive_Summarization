a few months after @entity1 bought @entity2 from @entity3 for £ 62.5million in 2006 the @entity0 passed on a message to @entity5 requesting a meeting			1
with more than 1,000 games under his belt as a manager , including two separate spells at @entity2 , @entity5 appeared to be the ideal sounding board for the club ’s new benefactor			1
nearly nine years on , after being left hanging about in a corridor following @entity2 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity16 on april 2 2007 , @entity5 is still waiting to make his acquaintance			1
@entity5 on his first day as @entity2 manager back in the summer of 1987 chairman at the time , @entity3 , welcomed @entity5 back to @entity2 for a second spell in charge in 2002 @entity1 , pictured with @entity3 in 2006 , did not keep his appointment with former @entity2 boss @entity5 ‘ he sent @entity26 ( former chief executive ) down to tell me he was busy , ’ remembers @entity5 of that bizarre incident at the beginning of the @entity0 ’s tenure			1
@entity5 is one of the lost generation , the 24 managers who have been on the touchline for more than 1,000 matches			1
those cut adrift include some wise old heads , such as @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity5			1
they are not young and trendy or fashionable , and they do not talk about the ‘ the group ’ , ‘ the philosophy ’ or ‘ false nines ’			2
but they do tell it how it is			2
@entity36 ( right ) always told it like it his during his time as manager at various clubs @entity38 ( left ) managed @entity52 and later was @entity53 's @entity54 when they won promotion in 2003 those who have managed 1,000 or more domestic league and cup matches in first - team competition			1
@entity60 , @entity61 , @entity32 , @entity62 , sir @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity33 , sir @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity35 , @entity53 , sir @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity72 , @entity5 , @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity73 , @entity74 it seems such a waste , particularly when men of this experience will have dealt with , or confronted virtually every issue within the game during their managerial careers			1
the only two men alive with 1,000 games to their names and still in the technical area as managers are @entity73 and @entity67			1
sir @entity65 , another member of that elite list of managers , was 71 when he won his last @entity90 title with @entity91			1
sensibly , he has been made a director			0
the rest are the forgotten men of @entity96 football			0
@entity32 won seven promotions during his career , but he has not worked in the game in a full - time capacity since he was assistant manager to @entity101 at @entity102 in 2008			0
@entity33 , one of the game ’s great minds , has been out of work since leaving his position as director of football at @entity109 strugglers @entity52			1
at @entity111 , when he was named @entity110 for the second successive year in 2007 , he was tipped to become the @entity113 boss			0
@entity33 , the former @entity111 and @entity114 boss , is part of the 1,000 club no doubt @entity38 would have wished he was on hand to advise former @entity52 owner @entity118 when he gave a toe - curling interview after swotting up on the history of the city when he bought the club in july 2006			1
even @entity36 , with six promotions in the @entity125 and recently sacked by @entity114 , should have something to give back to the game after a 34 - year managerial career			0
these guys should act as mentors , leaned on in a professional capacity by young managers making their way in the game , or by some of the cavalier owners who buy @entity96 football clubs			2
true , it does n’t help when knuckleheads like @entity140 make a pig ’s ear of things when they are given an unexpected opportunity , as he was when @entity145 named him director of football at @entity147			0
@entity140 gives the others a bad name			0
generally it is a young man ’s game , but it does seem odd that 13 of the men on that 23 - strong list ( sir @entity63 , sir @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity154 are sadly no longer with us ) are out of gainful employment			1
sir @entity65 , another 1,000 club member , was 71 when he won his 13th and final @entity90 crown there are others short of 1,000 matches - such as @entity162 or @entity163 - who have played in or managed dressing rooms at the highest level			1
both articulate their views brilliantly			0
the sport is a booming business : @entity91 have 837 full - time employees according to their investor relations literature ; @entity172 548 ( according to their 2014 annual report ) ; @entity174 368 ( 2013 annual report )			0
@entity71 ( @entity16 ’s professional development co-ordinator ) , @entity69 ( assistant manager at @entity177 ) and @entity66 ( @entity179 academy ) are still in the game			1
@entity71 , 65 , puts in the motorway miles monitoring the young players out on loan from @entity16 ’s academy			2
@entity73 is one of two managers still working with 1,000 games under his belt @entity113 manager @entity67 is the other still plying his trade in the technical area @entity71 , pictured with @entity16 boss @entity190 , remains a key part of the set - up at @entity193 he loves the role , but does not interfere in the work of head coach @entity190 or chairman @entity196 , and will only offer his opinion if it is sought			1
as a former @entity16 player and manager , a blue through and through , he is a valuable member of the team at @entity193			0
last weekend @entity71 was up at @entity202 to watch young @entity204 ( nephew of former @entity16 midfielder @entity206 ) score on his debut for @entity208 during their 3 - 2 defeat by @entity211			2
at 65 , @entity71 knows that his days as a manager are probably over , but he has a grounding in the sport that few can match after a lifetime in the game			2
@entity1 , who is thought to be worth around £ 1.5bn after a life working with investment banks , knew nothing about football when he bought @entity2 from @entity222			2
@entity224 talks the talk at @entity2 training ... can the new man walk the walk and keep them up ? @entity224 has a huge task on his hands after being given the reins at @entity2 the @entity0 has struggled to get to grips with the @entity96 game ever since			0
he could still learn a thing or two , despite employing a manager who is supremely confident of his own ability			0
‘ there are a lot of poor , experienced managers , ’ reflected @entity224 , who has become the fifth coach of @entity1 ’s ownership			2
‘ there are a lot of good ones too			0
i think it ’s over-rated			0
’ what can not be in doubt is the value of someone who has vast experience of handling difficult situations at a football club			0
without them , it will be the same old story .			0

there are 24 managers who have taken charge of 1,000 games or more
only @entity67 and @entity73 are still working as managers
