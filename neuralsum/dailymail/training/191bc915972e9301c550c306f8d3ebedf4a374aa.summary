what is your wildest desire ? i have one of those dreams — the most exotic , unattainable yearning i can imagine			0
but it is n’t winning the lottery , or something that would belong in the pages of @entity11			0
rather , my ultimate outrageous daydream is			0
not even @entity15 - meets - @entity17 hair			1
just something that resembles the stuff regular people have on their head			0
they can go swimming , then walk around as their hair dries into shiny , swingy shape			2
left to dry naturally , my hair is beyond frizzy			1
it is a trichological freak of nature i ’ve been putting up with for 50 years			1
my life is ruled by the tyranny of bludgeoning it into submission			2
any scheduled hair wash must allow 30 to 40 minutes for blow - drying and straightening irons , if i am to achieve the height of my styling ambitions — to look like other women			1
even non-washing days require a minimum ten minutes to wrestle it into normality			2
but the tyranny does n’t end there			0
any form of damp weather , humidity or drizzle sees my newly - straightened hair return to a frizzy mass within 60 seconds			1
volumising treatment : @entity24 undergoes the new , @entity59 blow - dry which has been devised by @entity61 hairdresser @entity60 to suit women with finer hair i ’ve often considered having a @entity65 blow - dry — a smoothing and straightening treatment in which the protein keratin is ironed into the hair — but it can cost up to £ 500 every three months , requires at least four hours in the salon , and is so full of formaldehyde that @entity72 was forced to slice her famous locks to chin - length after treatments ruined her hair			1
@entity65 blow - dries can also leave hair lank , stripping hair like mine of its one redeeming quality — volume			1
but now , salvation has emerged			0
the new , @entity59 blow - dry has been devised by @entity61 hairdresser @entity60 to suit those of us with finer hair			1
the formula costs £ 100 , takes 15 minutes to apply , contains no formaldehyde and promises specifically to preserve volume			1
fast frizz - banishment : the formula costs £ 100 , takes 15 minutes to apply , contains no formaldehyde and promises specifically to preserve volume rather than covering the whole head in straightening solution , as with a @entity65 treatment , it is painted only on to the frizziest parts ( the ends ) , avoiding roots , except right at the crown			1
what ’s more , you do n’t need to leave hair for several days after the treatment before washing it , as with the @entity65 version — 24 hours is all that ’s required			1
and , instead of avoiding any shampoo that contains sulphate afterwards ( as you must with the @entity65 ) any type is fine			1
i could n’t get to @entity60 ’s salon in @entity61 fast enough			2
‘ your hair is n’t actually super frizzy , ’ @entity60 claimed , as i settled into a chair			1
‘ the frizziest part is at the top of your crown , but that ’s quite common			0
’ the treatment was preceded with an ammonia - free glossing oil to add shine and moisture			2
in ten minutes , it was worked from root to tip , then left for another ten , before being shampooed away			2
now for @entity60 ’s formula			1
confidence boost : the treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned and creates a smooth , shiny finish ‘ i ’m applying smoothing keratin protein , specifically where the hair is more unmanageable , ’ he said , as he ran what looked like a tiny paintbrush through varying lengths of my hair			2
‘ @entity141 is one of the key constituents of the hair shaft			2
this treatment is designed to strengthen and smooth the hair and make it feel more moisturised and manageable			1
’ it sounded like the usual blurb you hear about lots of hair products			2
fifteen minutes later , @entity60 began blow - drying , and the difference was unmistakeable			1
it was the feel of my hair which , at this stage , was most noticeably different			0
‘ the treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned , ’ said @entity60			1
‘ it will not remove curl , but will create a smooth , shiny finish with body at the roots			0
‘ it is perfect for hair that reacts to humidity , and is suitable for most hair types			0
some @entity65 blow - dries alter the shade of coloured hair , but the @entity59 blow - dry helps condition it			1
’ four days later : @entity24 is delighted by the results of her @entity59 blow - dry and no longer needs straighteners just over an hour after entering the salon , i was done			1
running my hands through my hair felt wonderfully unfamiliar , and the way it bounced as i walked was a huge confidence boost			0
the first test was to drive the 30 miles home with my car roof down			0
before , i always had to tie my hair back ; otherwise , the buffeting snarled it into knots			0
this time , there was not one tangle ; it simply fell back into place			0
when i woke the next day , i ran to the mirror — and feared the spell had been broken when i saw my hair had gone flat either side of my head			0
but ten seconds with a brush saw the shape restored			0
later , i got caught in a downpour ; usually a recipe for disaster			0
i ran my fingers through my hair and it was straight again			0
then , the next day , the ultimate test : i washed it , having set aside the usual 40 minutes to blow - dry it			1
but after 15 minutes , there was nothing left to do			1
i did n’t even need my straightening irons			0
this is life - altering stuff			2
now , a new affliction has set in : a manic compulsion to keep touching the silky softness atop my head			0
and if that provokes stares , i do n’t care			0
i finally have great hair .			0

@entity220 *'s* life has been ruled by her frizzy hair for 50 years
she has often considered a @entity65 blow - dry , but is put off by the cost and the damage the formaldehyde - heavy treatment can wreak on hair
new @entity59 blow - dry devised by @entity60 is designed to suit fine hair
the formula cost £ 100 , takes 15 minutes to apply and preserves volume
