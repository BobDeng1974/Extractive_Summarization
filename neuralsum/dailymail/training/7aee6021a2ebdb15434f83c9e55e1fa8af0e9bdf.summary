' i spotted the panda in this set of photos rolling around in a concrete bathing area , he was there for about 30 minutes and every so often he would climb up the nearby and roll down over and over again until he hit the water			0
' unfortunately my lunch break was over all too soon but i could have watched the panda for hours , it was very entertaining to watch			0
photographer @entity31 was on hand to capture the playful panda as he took his lunch break the animal ended up filthier than it was before his bath , with leaves and branches sticking to his wet coat of fur the animals spend most of their time on the enclosure sleeping and snacking on bamboo said mr @entity31 who was volunteering at the centre the @entity66 panda reserve is a favourite among travelling animal lovers who can feed the animals and clean out their enclosures ' the park was not busy that day and these pandas were very far from the main gates , amazingly it was only me who got see it			1
