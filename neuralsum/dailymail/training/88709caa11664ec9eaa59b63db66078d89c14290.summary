mothers who smoke during pregnancy or while breastfeeding could be endangering their sons ’ fertility , research shows			2
scientists have found it permanently damages the reproductive organs so they produce faulty sperm			1
they say many men now in their 30s and 40s may be suffering the effects of their mothers smoking throughout pregnancy			1
around one in eight women now smoke when pregnant although this percentage was far higher in the 1970s and 80s when so little was known about its harmful effects			1
they found that the male pup mice produced far fewer sperm and they were of poorer quality			1
although the study was only in mice the researchers say the findings are relevant to mothers			0
professor @entity41 , co-director of the @entity42 in @entity43 at the @entity44 , in @entity45 , said : ‘ it would be unethical to deliberately expose pregnant mothers and their offspring to the toxins in cigarettes			2
‘ we already know that smoking in pregnancy harms the baby in the womb as babies are often born small and vulnerable to disease			0
‘ so in this study we used a mouse animal model which directly mimics human smoking , to look at what effects the mothers smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding has on the fertility of their male pups			1
‘ our results show that male pups of ‘ smoking ’ mothers have fewer sperm , which swim poorly , are abnormally shaped and fail to bind eggs			2
‘ this is the first time we have been able to prove conclusively that male baby exposure to cigarette toxins in pregnancy will damage later life fertility			0
the researchers said even if the boys never touched a cigarette during their teens or adulthood their cells could be permanently damaged from their mothers ’ bad habits ‘ although this is a study in mice , the findings are relevant to human health as many men , now in their 30s and 40s , were exposed to cigarette toxins in the womb when it was less well known that smoking affected babies ’ health			1
’ the researchers , whose study is published in the journal @entity97 , say even if the boys never touched a cigarette during their teens or adulthood their cells could be permanently damaged from their mothers ’ bad habits			0
they are now investigating whether mother ’s smoking also affects the future fertility of their daughters			0
doctors say that every time a pregnant woman smokes a cigarette it is like putting their foetus in a smoky room for 15 minutes			0
it has been shown to greatly increase the risk of stillbirth , miscarriage , prematurity and the baby being born underweight .			0
