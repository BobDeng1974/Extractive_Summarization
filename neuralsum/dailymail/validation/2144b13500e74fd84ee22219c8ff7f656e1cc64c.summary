they are popular with the likes of @entity2 and @entity3			0
but selfie sticks , the extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves with mobile phones , have now been banned in the @entity9			1
the move follows bans in galleries in @entity13 and @entity14 – including the @entity15 and the @entity16 in @entity17			1
the @entity9 has banned selfie sticks - extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves			1
the @entity22 ( pictured , visitors taking a snap with the @entity24 ) is revising its policy the @entity9 , which allowed cameras for the first time last year , is expelling the gadgets because they fall under the category of ‘ tripods ’ , which are already prohibited			1
@entity31 , a spokeswoman for the gallery , said : ' photography is allowed for personal , non-commercial purposes in the @entity9 – however there are a few exceptions in order to protect paintings , copyright of loans , individual privacy and the overall visitor experience			1
therefore the use of flash and tripods is not permitted			2
' our gallery assistants and visitor facing staff are fully briefed and instructed to ensure we are striking the correct balance between visitor experience and the security and safety of works on display			0
' therefore they will use their discretion on a case by case basis in preventing photography which puts the safety of the collection at risk or obstructs other visitors			0
' @entity64 visited the @entity9 in @entity65 on december 31 and took this selfie			1
writing on @entity67 , he said : ' so i went to @entity65 's @entity9 and there was selfie sticks everywhere ' while @entity71 , from the @entity22 , said : ' visitors to the @entity22 are permitted to take photographs in public areas , not including temporary exhibitions , for non-commercial purposes			1
' the museum is currently reviewing its policy on the use of " selfie - sticks " and other apparatus within the museum grounds			2
' the safety of objects and visitors is paramount to the @entity22 and staff will politely inform visitors if the use of any equipment is endangering objects or other people on site			1
' @entity93 visited the @entity9 last month and went for a selfie with @entity97 's famous ' @entity96 ' painting selfie sticks are currently allowed at the @entity99 , the @entity100 and the @entity101 in @entity102			1

' @entity111 from the @entity101 , said : ' visitors to the @entity101 are currently permitted to use selfie sticks in line with the museum ’s general policy on photographing and filming with a hand - held camera for personal use			2

@entity128 banned selfie sticks from @entity130 after a complaint from a fan , while they have also been barred at a number of galleries and museums in the @entity14 and @entity13			1
the online @entity137 dictionary describes a selfie stick as ' an elongated stick to which you attach a camera or mobile phone to take a better photo '			0
art critic @entity144 told @entity145 : ‘ if the @entity14 and @entity13 were banning them , the @entity146 should join in			0
they are possibly quite dangerous to the art work and cause appalling crowding around a painting			0
‘ anyone who actually wants to go and see a painting ca n’t because people are too busy taking photos			0
i ’ve seen things in the @entity9 which make my hair stand on end			1
’ even @entity158 , 44 , who organises an event which encourages youngsters to take a selfie in front of famous pieces of art , says the ban is a good idea			0
she branded the tools ' damaging ' to precious works , and said they get in everyone 's way			0
visitors to the @entity9 backed the ban today , including , @entity174 , who was waiting for the @entity176 exhibition to open			2
pier @entity177 took this selfie of himself with one of the hundreds of paintings at the @entity9 this couple ( left ) also took a selfie with the world famous painting while these girls ( right ) took a generic selfie in the @entity9 during their visit she said : ' it is an interference in what one hopes is a reasonably calm experience looking at great pictures			2
' another woman , who did not wish to be named , said art lovers would be ' thrilled ' by the ban			0
' it ’s becoming impossible to see pictures , ' she said			0
' first there ’s people with cameras then there ’s cameras with sticks			2
they should have been banned some time ago			2
' the @entity9 , which allowed cameras for the first time last year , is expelling the gadgets because they fall under the category of ‘ tripods ’ , which are already prohibited ( pictured , visitors to the @entity22 ) the @entity22 ( pictured ) is said to be reviewing its policy on the use of selfie sticks within its grounds following a ban by the @entity9 @entity215 and her boyfriend using a selfie stick outside the @entity9 in @entity65 last week the sticks first took off in @entity146 last summer as a wave of tourists arrived armed with them and by @entity122 the rods were one of the most popular gifts on @entity225			1
