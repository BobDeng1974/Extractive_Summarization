by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 14 january 2013 with the leading lady a 12 - year - old cow called @entity3 and the story set against the backdrop of a @entity7 dairy farm , it does n't scream ' @entity10 winner '			1
but a documentary about maverick farmer @entity12 and his herd of 55 cows has won the hearts of the judges at @entity18 's prestigious @entity17			1
he and director @entity19 are set to rub shoulders with @entity21 after @entity22 was chosen to represent @entity23 at this year 's competition in @entity25 , @entity26			1
but it is his relationship with his herd , in particular @entity3 the @entity48 cow , which steals the show			1
the @entity50 will be pitched against rival offerings including @entity52 , a study of the three women whose struggles gained worldwide notoriety as they were jailed in @entity57 for their riotous performance in a @entity60 cathedral			2
action : the film is being entered into the @entity64 category alongside other documentaries such as @entity52 , a study of the @entity57 protest band who were jailed for for a performance at @entity60 cathedral leading man and farmer mr @entity12 has no doubts his herd of cows will tug at the heart strings and make the surprise @entity23 entry a huge hit with critics at the international festival in @entity26			1
he said : ' i think it 's a wonderful , laugh - out - loud film but i ca n't quite believe it has been selected to star at such a major festival			1
my life is as far from @entity52 as it 's possible to get			0
' so far the @entity50 has only been shown at a private viewing to 100 family and friends at a small cinema in @entity90 near the farm			0
but both the adults and kids seemed to love it			0
' it made them laugh and cry at different scenes and everyone seemed enchanted by the story			0
getting picked for the @entity17 is a very big deal and something we never ever thought possible in a million years			0
' it 's beautifully shot and the on - screen chemistry between me and my leading lady , a half - tonne @entity48 cow called @entity3 , is entirely down to her			2
i did n't choose her as the star of the show , she is the queen of the herd and just took over			2
' she was a natural show - off when the cameras started rolling			2
we joked that @entity3 was really milking her screen debut because she certainly liked the spotlight			0
' the film took a painstaking 130 hours and two years to make at the picturesque farm where mr @entity12 and his father @entity118 have worked for more than 20 years as a partnership producing organic milk			1
and behind the scene - stealing qualities displayed by @entity3 and the herd are the serious problems the family has faced to stay afloat			1
milking it : the film follows farmer @entity12 in his battle to keep his dairy business afloat setting the scene : @entity12 and his father @entity118 have been running the dairy farm in @entity7 featured are long working days of milking duties and deliveries while big business interests try and undercut his efforts			1
but @entity0 knows every cow by name and says he shares a real bond with each animal			2
in one scene he takes favourite cow @entity3 to nearby @entity143 to try and generate more business with a beach photo shoot to find she enjoys the seaside so much she refuses to leave			0
@entity0 also spends hours with a cow too weak to rejoin the herd after a difficult birth that creates a tear - jerking drama			1
the @entity50 has been made by the small @entity7 - based @entity152 production company and will be screened at the @entity17 billed as ' you will never see cows the same way again			1
' director @entity19 explained : ' we wanted to show the extraordinary bond we can still have with the animals we farm			1
' it became obvious during filming that @entity0 has a wonderful relationship with his animals , a bond that most of us have forgotten can exist			1
but his way of life is seriously under threat			0
' i live near the farm and thought it would make a compelling story , never expecting the recognition it is attracting			0
' making the movie meant shivering through mid winter milking , crouching in damp meadows for summer calvings and dodging the odd stampede			0
now @entity0 and @entity19 will travel to the festival , where the film is entered in the @entity181 section , this weekend			0
it has also been selected for the @entity183			0
the driving force behind the @entity17 , actor @entity18 , started the event in 1978			0
@entity0 added : ' i ca n't believe the company i will be keeping in the next few days			0
we have such a quiet life normally but we have a great film and i am sure it will be popular			0
' it started being about one farmer bucking the trend and taking on the supermarkets but in the end what came across most strongly was the characters of the cows			1
' like humans they are all different characters			2
but they are beautiful animals and worthy of the red carpet treatment			2
