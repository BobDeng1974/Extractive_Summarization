if there is one thing i 'm a celebrity viewers have noticed this series it 's that @entity7 body really is a sight to behold			1
so fabulously toned is the 44 - year - old mother - of - two that her rock hard six pack has been the talk of the show in and outside the camp			2
in an interview prior to her move to the jungle , @entity14 revealed her body is n't thanks to a get fit quick plan after signing up for the show			1
@entity14 's trainer @entity43 revealed that the secret to having a body like hers is you have to do a variety of exercises as well as sticking to a healthy diet			1
he said : ' all too often people make the mistake of doing 100 ’s of crunches morning and night in the hope this will unearth the abs of @entity58 in the 1990 ’s			2
' @entity43 recommends a mixture of five different exercises			1
starting with jumping sumo squats : ' these are similar to traditional jumping squats but with feet at a 45 degree angle to really work the inner thighs and gluts , ' he explained			2
next try an ' own body weight push up with shoulder touch			1
' this is a challenging twist to a push up , once at the top touch your shoulder with the opposing arm , giving a " down , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity78 " rhythm			2
' the third exercise that he recommends is jumping lunges : ' this will get your heart rate up as well and working the gluts and quads			1
' prepared for the jungle : @entity14 claims that she has been bikini ready for seven whole years proud : before heading into the jungle @entity14 posted bikini pictures to her @entity91 account showing off her body getting glammed up : @entity7 has her hair done by her close friend celebrity hair and make - up stylist @entity96 in another @entity91 snap next he recommends core stability move ' the plank '			1
' switch your weight between your forearms and the palms of the hands for the duration of the hold , this engages a greater number of the abdominals than a static plank , ' he said			0
the final - and possibly most difficult exercise - that @entity43 recommends is burpees			1
' begin in a standing position			0
feet shoulder - width apart , he explains			0

kicking feet back to their original squat position			0
stand up , and then jump into the air while reaching arms overhead			0
' but while these exercises will help you burn calories and become fitter and stronger , @entity43 said it 's not the only thing that will give you a body like @entity14 's			1
he said : ' remember , diet is as important as exercise			0
avoid sugar dense food and drinks as this is known to sit on your midriff , it important to chose wisely post exercise to rehydrate and recover			0

before heading into the jungle @entity14 revealed to ok ! magazine that she has been happy with her body for some time			1
however she did voice her concerns that she would lose weight thanks to the meagre jungle portions			0
