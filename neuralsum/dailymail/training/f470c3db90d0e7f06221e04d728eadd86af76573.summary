after joking about her ‘ bucket list ’ to friends , they promptly posted it on @entity14 , appealing for help to make @entity21 ’s dreams come true			1
and the incredible response the @entity14 page has received means she has ticked off more than half of her list since it was published last month			1

' it was a dream come true			2
it ’s something i ’ve always wanted to do but never had the chance , ' she says			2
' for a night i got to forget about the cancer and just had a brilliant time giggling with my daughters and friends			1
‘ we felt like stars being driving around the city in the limo sipping bubbly and the driver was fantastic			1
i ’m so grateful that putting the bucket list on @entity14 has made it possible to create memories like this for my daughters			2
’ @entity21 , who is mother to 24 - year - old twin girls @entity83 and @entity85 , now hopes to reach the end of her list , but her health is deteriorating faster than expected			1
dream holiday : @entity21 pictured on holiday with her daughters in @entity73 , a trip which was on her bucket list ‘ recent blood tests have shown my liver is struggling but i ’m determined to keep ticking things off my list , ' she admits			1
‘ it ’s helping me to keep strong and focused			2
i may have terminal cancer but i ’m determined to keep living my life while i can			2
i might not have long left , but what i do have left i want to be fun			2
‘ these will be the last few weeks of my life and i want to live life to the maximum while i still can and really enjoy this time			2
‘ i have down days when i get very scared about dying , but then i get a message saying someone else has read the bucket list and wants to help and it makes me feel strong again			0
' @entity21 ’s biggest wish is to continue to raise awareness of bowel cancer and save other lives , which she hopes will be achieved through telling her story			1
she was diagnosed in 2010 after noticing blood in the toilet after she used it			0
@entity21 had put earlier symptoms like weight loss and lethargy down to a new diet and exercise regime which had helped her drop from a size 16 to a size ten			0
highlight : @entity21 is seen attending a music festival , which was one of the items on her ' bucket list ' @entity169 : @entity21 is seen attending a @entity171 theatre show , another dream she had listed ‘ ironically i felt fitter , happier and healthier than i had in years			0
i even wore a bikini for the first time , ' she says			0
‘ i put all the signs down to the exercise i was doing			0
it was no surprise i was tired and losing weight because i was going to the gym every day			0

of course if i had n’t been dieting and exercising i would have gone to the gp straight away			0
’ she began chemotherapy to shrink the tumour to an operable size soon after being diagnosed			0
but while she was on the operating table , doctors discovered the cancer had spread to her liver			0
despite further treatment , more tumours were then found in her lungs and liver			0
‘ i was running out of options but i ’ve always stayed positive and tried to fight it			0
i preferred not to ask the question about how long because i still hoped i could win , ' she says			0
after beginning more chemotherapy this year , her doctor suggested that she consider stopping treatment altogether			0
‘ basically the chemotherapy was making me very ill and my doctor suggested i stop , ' she explains ' they said there was nothing left to try			0
it was palliative care only			0
i was finally at the stage where i felt i needed to know how long i had			0
‘ when they said six months i knew it was time to start planning and started writing my bucket list			0
in a way it ’s a privilege to be able to know and prepare and do wonderful things			0
' i do n’t have time to waste , especially as that was two months ago so i may only now have weeks			0
‘ @entity251 has taken many things from me , but i wo n’t let it spoil these last few weeks of fun with my girls			0
