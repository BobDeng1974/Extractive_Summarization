by @entity0 sugar sickness : @entity2 had all the signs of diabetes , but thought she was just ' stressed ' the symptoms pointed to a text - book case of diabetes : unexplained sudden weight loss , an unquenchable thirst , a craving for sugary food , and a life - sapping exhaustion that left @entity2 too tired to lift her baby twin boys			1
yet the @entity15 folk singer simply put the gradually growing list of problems down to ‘ tour stress ’			1
@entity2 was 31 at the time , in 2007 , and had been a healthy size eight her whole adult life , always about eight stone			1
but , a year before , she had given birth prematurely to twins @entity24 and @entity25 , going into labour while performing on stage in @entity28 – and felt she had never ‘ bounced back ’			1
she explains : ‘ we were on tour in @entity31 – i ’m from @entity32 – and i was exhausted			2
i was eating the same as usual but then got a craving for chocolate muffins and doughnuts			2
and i was constantly thirsty			2
‘ my clothes were hanging off me			2
when i weighed myself , i was under six stone			1
' the crunch came when we got back home to @entity43 ' i crossed the room to lift one of the boys out of his cot and i could n’t pick him up			1
' my husband , @entity48 , put his foot down			1
it was time i went to the doctor			2
’ @entity2 was immediately referred to the @entity53 hospital where the twins were born			1
later that day she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes			1
@entity2 says : ‘ i felt my body had let me down			1
for three days , i was cast into a deep depression , almost as though i was in mourning			2
i thought i ’d have to give up my career			2
how could i tour ? how could i look after the boys properly ? ' and i certainly was n’t going to be injecting myself three or four times a day			2
it ’s impossible to prove this , but one consultant said my immune system had taken a bit of a battering following my emergency caesarean			0
so that could have acted as a trigger for my autoimmune system to stop functioning properly			0
’ there are 3.2 million diabetics in the @entity74 , ten per cent with type 1			1
diabetes affects the body ’s ability to process glucose , the molecule most carbohydrates are broken down into by digestion before passing into the bloodstream			1
the hormone insulin is produced to help this sugar enter cells , where it is used for energy			0
@entity88 , clinical adviser for @entity90 , explains : ‘ people develop type 1 diabetes because the immune system attacks the cells that naturally produce insulin			1
we still do n’t understand why			0
typically , this form of diabetes occurs in people under 40 , quite often in children once they reach double figures			1
’ in type 2 diabetes , usually linked to obesity , the gland that produces insulin – the pancreas – stops working			1
although it is not fully understood , some studies suggest that a virus or other environmental stress might trigger this			1
new lease : @entity2 , pictured holding @entity24 with @entity48 and @entity25 at the piano , dropped two stone and was too tired to pick up her own children before she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes the acute symptoms that @entity2 experienced – frequent urination , increased thirst , blurred vision and extreme tiredness – are a result of sugar building up to damaging levels in the blood , affecting the function of all organs			1
last year home secretary @entity127 revealed she had been diagnosed with type 1 aged 56 – ending speculation about her dramatic weight loss			1
@entity132 @entity131 has also been affected as an adult			0
once , type 1 diabetes was fatal but regular injections of synthetic insulin mean it is now easy to manage			1
@entity2 says : ‘ on the fourth morning my depression gave way to determination			1
i was n’t going to let this thing beat me			0
i was n’t going to die of diabetes ; i was going to live with it			2
‘ we were due to tour @entity145 and @entity146			0
so i asked the consultant how to cope with the time zones			0
normally , she said , she ’d recommend a week - long course to teach me how to count my carbohydrate intake			2
helping hand : it was @entity2 's husband @entity48 who made her go to the doctor in 2007 ' but she arranged a half - day crash course			1
then i bought scales to weigh the food and work out the carbs			0
i became pretty obsessive , eliminating everything with added sugar			0
but i realised this was the diabetes controlling me			2
‘ so i worked out how much insulin i ’d need depending on what i planned to eat and then had whatever i wanted , which might include a couple of glasses of wine			0
’ @entity2 injects herself ten minutes before a meal and once each evening at 10pm to last through the night			1
‘ i never thought i ’d be able to do it but it ’s amazing what you get used to , ’ she says			0
if she ’s doing a gig , though , she has to adjust her insulin levels			0
performing increases adrenaline which raises blood sugar levels			0
‘ i have to compensate with an injection before i need it to take account of the adrenaline rush that will kick in as soon as i start singing			0
get it wrong and it starts making my voice go wobbly			0
’ in october 2010 , her daughter @entity188 was born			0
‘ i had to have very tight blood glucose control throughout the pregnancy because your sugar levels are so random as your hormones are all over the place			0
i have a small device to test the level			0
‘ your blood sugar level should be around five			0
being pregnant made it shoot up , which is why i needed regular insulin			0
but if it falls too low , you risk a hypoglycaemic attack and blacking out			0
i had to have a blood test every six weeks			0
’ at 38 weeks , @entity188 was delivered by caesarean weighing a healthy 7lb 14oz			2
although type 1 diabetes is not an inherited disease , a first - degree relative is six times more likely to develop it			1
@entity2 ’s children are currently all well , but she adds : ‘ i had a cousin who died of the condition			1
’ ‘ this will sound odd , ’ she says , ‘ but i honestly think diabetes has made me a better person			2
i ’m certainly much more disciplined			0
’ and the career that was nearly killed off by her debilitating illness ? with a new album just recorded and a tour of @entity221 around the corner , it ’s looking better than ever			0
@entity223 , by @entity2 , is released on may 19			1
