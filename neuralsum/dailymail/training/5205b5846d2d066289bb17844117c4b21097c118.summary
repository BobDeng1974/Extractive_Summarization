@entity0 is seeking a presidential pardon for handing @entity3 state secrets to the @entity5 website because it was done ' out of a love for my country '			2
according to documents released today , @entity0 's lawyer , @entity9 , has sent a @entity11 to president @entity12			1
the @entity13 said last month that if @entity0 requested a presidential pardon she would be considered the same as anyone else			1
in the petition she wrote that she had started questioning the morality of @entity3 actions in @entity20 and @entity21 while reading secret military reports			0
she said : ' when i chose to disclose classified information , i did so out of a love for my country and sense of duty to others			0
' @entity0 acknowledged she had broken the law , adding , ' i regret if my actions hurt anyone or harmed the @entity3			0
' @entity0 signed the petition ' @entity0 ' , not @entity34 , as her name has not legally been changed			1
@entity0 poses in a wig and lipstick ( left ) and is escorted into a day of her court martial as her legal identity , @entity0 ( right ) @entity0 's lawyer @entity9 has sent a petition for a @entity42 to the @entity13 @entity43 , a law professor and founder of a commutation clinic at @entity46 in @entity47 , gave @entity0 's petition a ' zero per cent ' chance of success			1
@entity43 noted that the president has granted just 39 pardons and one commutation since taking office , while he has denied 1,333			0
@entity55 added that it is also very early in @entity0 's confinement for the @entity13 to seriously consider such a request			1
@entity0 is currently serving a 35 - year sentence at @entity60 , @entity61 , for her conviction on july 30 on 20 counts of disclosing information while working as an intelligence analyst in @entity20			1
since being convicted @entity0 has said she wants to live as a woman and two @entity68 behavioral health specialists diagnosed her with gender dysphoria			0
@entity0 now wants to start hormone replacement therapy inside jail , and though the courts have refused , she is challenging the decision			0
in another twist , she is also asking the @entity68 to pay for her treatment under their health insurance scheme			0
president @entity12 has granted relatively few pardons during his time in office the october 2010 release by @entity5 of hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports , diplomatic cables and a video of a @entity3 helicopter attack that killed civilians , was the largest leak of classified material in @entity3 history			1
following the documents ' publication @entity0 was arrested and the @entity5 site closed down			0
@entity93 , the site 's front - man , is still claiming asylum inside the @entity97 embassy in @entity98 following rape allegations which he claims are bogus charges designed to have him extradited to the @entity3 the @entity12 administration has cracked down on security breaches , charging seven people with leaking to the media whereas only three people were prosecuted under all previous presidents			2
@entity93 has been claiming asylum inside the @entity97 embassy in @entity98 since 2012 following his trial , @entity0 got the longest ever sentence for disclosing @entity3 government secrets to others for publication			2
at her trial government witnesses testified that some of the leaked information endangered information sources , forced ambassadors to be reassigned , were used as @entity120 propaganda and even obtained directly by @entity121			0
however , @entity9 wrote in a cover letter to @entity0 's petition that none of @entity0 's disclosures caused any ' real damage ' to the @entity3 and that the documents were not sensitive information meriting protection			1
@entity9 submitted 11 documents in support of @entity0 's petition including five documents about sgt. 1st class @entity134 , one of @entity0 's former supervisors			1
the sergeant testified that he was reprimanded and demoted , apparently for failing to report @entity0 's troubling behavior - including a photo of the soldier in a blond wig and lipstick - partly because he could n't risk losing an intelligence analyst			2
also among the documents was a letter from @entity146 , which said @entity0 's leaks exposed potential human rights violations .			0

@entity9 , @entity34 's lawyer , has sent a petition for @entity42 to president @entity12
the @entity13 has said that a petition by @entity0 would be treated like any other
