delight : @entity2 have kept themselves in contention for the @entity23 with their @entity25 win @entity2 could do no wrong for the first half - hour as they stormed into a 22 - 0 lead but veteran forward @entity28 inspired a remarkable fightback for the visitors			1
three - quarters @entity31 and @entity33 , both playing on loan from @entity2 , scored tries against their parent club to help set up a tense finish before the @entity2 were able to finally complete a third win of the season over their near neighbours			2
@entity7 created the first scoring opportunity when full - back @entity43 burst clear with stand - off @entity45 on his inside but the final pass went astray and the @entity2 proceeded to give them a lesson in finishing			2
@entity43 brought second rower @entity52 short of the line but the @entity54 could not regroup in time to prevent full - back @entity55 slicing through for the opening in the next play			0
loose forward @entity59 was then held up over the line before left winger @entity60 produced two excellent finishes to score two tries in 15 minutes			0
exciting hooker @entity63 was the provider on both occasions , the first from a trademark surge following a quickly taken re-start and the second with a superb cut - out pass			0

@entity43 added the conversion , to register the 500th goal of his career , and @entity7 scored again three minutes before half - time when @entity78 fumbled @entity94 's high kick to gift a try to @entity81			0
@entity7 had the momentum at that stage and centre @entity100 touched down two minutes into the second half only to discover he had put a foot in touch and @entity2 managed to regain control of the game			2
