by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 07:43 est , 14 march 2014 controversial @entity2 ! champion @entity3 has revealed his favourite part of his 12 - show run was not walking away with a whopping $ 300,000 in prize money but overhearing the show 's camera men exclaiming ' this kid is too damn good			1
' the 30 - year - old insurance analyst bared all to @entity12 users yesterday , taking part in one of the social - networking website 's ' @entity12 ' events , where a celebrity fields questions from the site 's users			1
when asked to describe the atmosphere behind the scenes of the television show , which was first broadcast in @entity23 50 years ago , mr @entity3 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' i never saw @entity27 [ @entity28 , the presenter ] at all backstage , though he was very nice to everyone during the little chats during the credits			1
his strategy involved ditching the usual style of finishing each category 's questions before moving on			2
instead , he switched - up his category choices , seemingly at random , to keep his opponents guessing			2
after spending weeks studying the game before his appearances , he concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely to contain the hidden @entity60 - where contestants have a chance to double their winnings - and he played specifically to seek them out			2
@entity3 's run makes him the third most successful contestant ever to appear on @entity2 ! - outside of special competitions - but he was still a way behind reigning champion @entity69 , who walked away with $ 2.5million after 74 consecutive victories in 2004			1
@entity3 's aggressive strategy earned a lot of flak from fans of the show , particularly on social media , as they felt it showed a lack of respect of the game 's conventions			1
jeopardy ! champ @entity3 plans to take his wife @entity82 on a vacation to @entity84 @entity3 told @entity12 that while he expected some backlash , he was shocked at how vehement his critics became			1
he said : ' i was n't surprised that there was a negative reaction - in researching past contestants like @entity91 and @entity92 who 've had a similar playstyle i saw a ton of hate for them from @entity96			1
' i was still surprised to get as much hate as quickly as i did -- i thought people might get mad at me after i 'd been on the show for a while , but i kind of got freaked out at how many negative tweets there were after just my first night			2
' he singled out some of the abuse as particularly spiteful			0
he said : ' the most mind - blowing one was the one that literally said " i hope your wife dies "			0
that 's beyond even clever trolling to just straight - up mental problems			0
' despite all this hate , @entity3 told @entity12 users he did not let it get to him			1
' i do n't really get mad on a personal level with haters because , well , how can i take it personally when they do n't know me as a person ? ' he said			1
' it 's such a clich√©d lesson to say you 've learned but having been on the " celebrity " side of the fence i kind of see how messed up it is , people making judgments about you based on one thing you said or one face you made in front of a camera			0
' @entity3 hopes his experience of dealing with the social media controversy could help him cash in even further and he is considering writing a book on the subject			1
@entity3 , 30 , pictured with @entity2 ! host @entity137 , won a whopping $ 297,000 using game theory he said : ' if i ever do write something it 'll probably be more addressed at the social - media backlash and the backlash - to - the - backlash and the whole weird phenomenon of being a media " villain " , which to me is the much more unique part of the story			1
' while previous @entity150 with high - profile figures such as @entity152 and @entity153 attracted nearly 30,000 comments , mr @entity3 's saw 1,500 messages posted onto his thread			1
however , despite the lower turnout , his jokey tone during the conversations was in stark contrast to the dour - at times even arrogant - persona he adopted while on television			2
@entity163 : @entity3 's game - play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure the change of tack even allowed him to win over some former critics , with one user posting : ' @entity171 , the first night you were on jeopardy , i tweeted you ( " please , @entity3 , do not win # jeopardy			1
i will not watch another episode with you on it " @ amyedwardst )			0
you tweeted back and i felt really bad / guilty			0
did i hurt your feelings ? i really am very sorry			0
congratulations on your winnings ! i miss you being on the show			0
' according to @entity3 , his cold persona was never meant to come across as brash and thinks that letting it slip was the reason for his downfall			1
he said : ' it was n't really a conscious strategy to intimidate people			0
i think when i said that the game is " about intimidation " a lot of my critics took that to mean i was a dick , like i walked into the green room , folded my arms and spat " @entity200 lousy maggots " at all y'all			0
champion @entity3 : @entity3 , who took home close to $ 300,000 in prize money before finally being kicked off @entity2 ! on wednesday night , told @entity204 he planned to spend the money wisely ' in reality the main thing was that i knew that lots of @entity2 contestants are smart but it 's their emotions that make them lose			1
and i was really really intent on not letting my emotions get to me -- in the end i was unsuccessful and went " on tilt " once i started having a bad day , leading to my loss , but it was being a " robot " onstage that kept me from freaking out and kept me focused enough to still pull out victories even after taking big losses			0
' @entity3 has a number of ideas of how to best use his financial windfall			2
firstly , he plans take his wife , @entity224 , on holiday to @entity84 but then intends to split the rest of the $ 297,200 jackpot between investments and charitable donations			0
when pushed on which charities he might choose , @entity3 gave the controversial answer of @entity232 , an organisation that has been in the news as much for its founder @entity234 's alleged crimes as it has for its work supporting whistleblowers			1
he said : ' i 'm super troubled about the things we continue to learn about the @entity23 government 's surveillance of the @entity242 , the way our wars are being conducted overseas without a proper sense of law or accountability , etc. ' i have a lot of differences with @entity232 as an organization and @entity234 in particular as a person , but it 's the only organization big enough and loud enough to be making a major difference with those issues right now and i can not believe how incredibly f * * * * * up it was that the whole banking industry basically colluded to make it impossible to donate money to them and most people did not apparently see anything wrong with this			2
' @entity3 , who works as a voice over artist on the side , said his only regret about his appearance on the show was allowing producers who convince him to demonstrate his voice skills on national television as he thinks , looking back , it was far from his best work			2
however , overall he said he had ' a blast ' and said ' it 's never a bad thing to come home to your wife and tell her you just made $ 100,000 for one day of work			0
' he said : ' so much ridiculously good stuff has happened -- not just the money but the insane 15 minutes of fame i 've gotten , the @entity281 fan following , the crazy experiences like being flown out to @entity283 on @entity285 's dime to be on national tv -- that i 'd be an ass to say i regretted any of it			0
' like i said i even have to be grateful to the haters because i 'd never have attained the status of " supervillain " if not for their outsized negative response to me			0
' however , he did admit that it did n't feel that way at the time			0
' yes , in retrospect i had a blast			0
it was an amazing experience -- but at the time it was n't fun , it was pure pain and sacrifice			0
it 's the kind of " fun " that 's fun in your memory because you worked your ass off at something incredibly hard and against all odds you got good at it and it paid off -- but at the time you 're suffering , ' he said			0
mr @entity3 was finally unseated by @entity312 of @entity313 , @entity314 , who led wednesday 's show with $ 15,700			1
@entity3 , who described @entity312 on @entity12 as a ' worthy successor ' , struggled for much of the show when , in @entity2 , he risked , and lost , his entire day 's bankroll - $ 6,400 - on the question : ' he was the last male monarch who had not previously been @entity320			1
' only @entity312 had the correct response : @entity322 .			2

@entity3 , a 30 - year - old from @entity25 , took to the social networking site to answer questions from users
said his *unemotional* style was key to his success
he was surprised by the level of the backlash against him but said he did n't take it personally
his jokey style during the online *q&a* *session* won over many of his critics
may donate a chunk of his $ 300,000 winnings to @entity232
thinks @entity312 will be a ' worthy successor '
