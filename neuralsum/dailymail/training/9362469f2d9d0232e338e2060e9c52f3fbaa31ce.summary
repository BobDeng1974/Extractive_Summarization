it is a nightmare we have all face - a cracked screen that means a long wait for a replacement			1
however , @entity6 has unveiled a new ' modular ' handset that allows users to simply slot in new modules - including the screen - themselves			1
it plans to launch the radical handset , which allows users to add everything from an extra battery to a thermometer , in @entity19 this year			1
there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			2
@entity40 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			1
larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger , or additional modules , than the mini will			0
the company will partner with @entity51 - based carrier @entity50 and local carrier @entity52 as part of a pilot program that will allow people to choose their own hardware based on their needs and interests			0
it will be sold from free - standing stores that look like food trucks , said @entity62 , a @entity6 marketing executive			1
she said @entity19 was chosen in part because more than 90 percent of households on the island of nearly 3.7 million people use a cellphone and 77 percent of internet access occurs through mobile devices			1
' all of this makes for a truly interesting carrier landscape , ' she said at a module developers conference at @entity6 's headquarters in @entity74			1
' mobile devices are a huge part of daily life ' in @entity19			2
the pilot program is still being developed , but @entity78 said she envisions stores first opening in the capital of @entity82 , followed by @entity83 , the island 's second largest city			0
stores would eventually open in other cities			0
@entity6 would manufacture and sell the phone frame as well as modules created by individual manufacturers that can be added to it like @entity92			1
modules would range from a screen to a camera to speakers to even a pedometer , depending on people 's needs			2
' we want people to walk away and say , ' that was really freaking awesome , '' @entity78 said			0
@entity6 says it 's too early to say how much the phone could cost , but it might be in the $ 50 to $ 100 range			1
@entity6 says the handset will allow users to replace their own screen in seconds ashould they break it the company has had success with its @entity111 computers , which are lightweight , low - priced laptops that require @entity113 connections to access most programs and other features , but it relies on outside manufacturers for the product			1
it has had more difficulty selling devices it makes on its own			0
@entity121 , its @entity113 - connected eyewear , still has n't made it to the mass market more than two years after its release to developers and a digital media player called the @entity127 was scrapped within a few months of its unveiling in 2012			0
@entity129 , a @entity130 employee in @entity82 , said he expects many @entity19 to embrace the modular phone , noting that they are always eager to buy the newest mobile devices and do n't mind standing in long lines			2
' they always want to be ahead with what 's newest , with what 's innovative , ' he said , adding that despite the island 's long economic slump , cellphone sales have always been good			0
' you tell them it costs $ 800 and they 're not fazed			0
' others took a more reserved stance			0
@entity146 , a @entity82 engineer , said he was surprised by the announcement			0
' typically , the island is n't used as a testing ground for this sort of project , ' he said			0
' i 'm not planning on buying it yet as at this point it seems more a gimmick than anything else			0
when the idea is further developed and able to compete with the current flagships , i would consider it			0
' new modules are simply clicked into the frame of the handset @entity6 has even shown off a ' night vision ' module for the phone @entity167 , chief information officer for @entity19 's government , said in a phone interview from @entity6 's headquarters that the company approached him and other officials in mid- 2014 with their proposal			1
he said he hopes the pilot program grows into something bigger that will allow programmers in @entity19 to develop modules and export them			1
' it would represent great technological growth , ' he said			0
@entity180 , the head of @entity40 , said ' the design must overcome the connotations of boxiness and brick - like that people associate with modularity , ' he said			1
@entity6 is working with @entity186 on the project			2
the back of the @entity40 handset allows modules to be quickly removed and replaced			1
speakers , cameras , lights , batteries and fitness sensors can all be put on the phone when needed - then simply removed			0
the prototype handset , which @entity6 showed off for the first time this week - although it failed to load fully			1
' it 's called the @entity199 because it 's meant to be drab grey to get people to customise it , ' mr @entity180 said			0
the phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			2
lower - resolution cameras can be swapped with higher - res versions , and users will be also be able to @entity212 replacement parts			2
by printing their own parts , users will also be able to customise them			2
@entity6 has revealed each phone will have a central ' spine ' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed ' endo ' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to			1
@entity6 's much - anticipated modular smartphone could be available in january 2015 for as little as $ 50 ( Â£ 30 ) there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			1
@entity229 will be able to accommodate more modules than the mini will , for example			0
@entity6 's kit describes various modules including batteries , @entity237 and @entity238 chips , cameras , speakers and more			1
in theory , any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a device , and while @entity6 will make the shell , these modules will be made by other companies			1
one of the proposed final designs for the project			0
each module clips in and out depending on what feature the user wants			0
at the developer conference , @entity6 outlined a time frame for development for the modular device , attempting to attract hardware and software developers			1
the main frame of the @entity199 will be built to last around five to six years , according to mr @entity180 , allowing users to upgrade their phones regularly			2
he added that the basic framework can be used to build any number of devices , beyond a simple smartphone			0
' if it can be other things , we encourage that , ' mr @entity180 said but added that @entity6 intends @entity269 to be ' ultimately a great smartphone first and foremost '			2
@entity40 was developed as a result of @entity6 's purchase of @entity273 and its @entity274			1
it is based on the @entity276 designs by @entity277 inventor @entity276			0
it was initially assigned to @entity273 , and had been planned to add to the firm 's existing range , but @entity6 sold the phone maker to @entity281 in january .			2

@entity40 consists of frame , screen , @entity237 connection and *processor*
users can customise it with plug - in modules , *colours* and *accessories*
