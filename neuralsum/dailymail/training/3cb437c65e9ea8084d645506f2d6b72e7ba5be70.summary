by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 18 december 2012 two soldier brothers banned from fighting together to prevent a double tragedy were both blown up the same stretch of road in @entity6			1
but the two bothers have both returned home alive , with their escapades bearing a striking resemblance to @entity12 's film saving private @entity13			1
@entity16 brothers @entity14 , 22 , and @entity17 , 21 , were prevented from fighting together by military bosses to prevent their family from losing both in a single attack			1
brothers in arms : @entity23 , left , and @entity17 , right , were both involved in @entity24 ied attacks in @entity6			1
but both brothers have returned home safely to @entity28 , @entity16 for @entity29 the safety measures proved futile , however , as both brothers were involved in @entity24 attacks in the same area only three weeks apart			1
thankfully for the @entity17 family , the brothers have both returned home to @entity28 for @entity29 after their lucky escapes			1
the soldiers from @entity40 of @entity41 spent six months based just kilometres apart in @entity42 in @entity43			2
younger brother @entity44 was the first to be involved in a @entity24 attack while on patrol			1
recalling the incident , he said : ' we would routinely travel on one of the main routes between @entity42 and @entity51			2
' but the villages there had a heavy @entity24 presence and @entity55 ( @entity55 ) were a constant danger			1
similarity : in @entity12 's @entity59 - winning @entity58 , an army captain , played by @entity61 , seeks to find a private and bring him home during @entity63 when his three brothers are killed in battle success : @entity58 , starring @entity61 , left , and @entity67 , centre , was nominated for 11 @entity59 ' one day towards the end of my tour , we ’d been taking some troops to a checkpoint and were on our way back to camp when we hit the ied			2
' the only thing i really remember is our vehicle been flipped on its side and a plume of black smoke filling the air			0
' we received covering fire from a vehicle behind us and all got out			0
we had a few bruises and one of the lads knackered his back but all in all it was a lucky escape			0
' older brother @entity14 was behind the wheel of a @entity93 armoured vehicle when another ied exploded only three weeks later			1
@entity14 said : ' the @entity93 vehicles are an immense piece of kit and undoubtedly saved our lives			2
' without them we ’d have probably both been killed			0
' blast : the two incidents occurred within three weeks of each other at the same location on a route between @entity42 and @entity104 wreckage : a large hole can be seen blasted in the ground following a car bomb in @entity108 , @entity6 , on monday			1
the bomb exploded outside a compound housing a @entity112 military contractor in the @entity6 capital @entity14 was on his second tour of @entity6 , while @entity44 on tour in the country for the first time			1
@entity14 said : ' i would come up to his checkpoint every three to four days when we needed to re-supply them			2
' i do n’t think back and worry about having a close escape , it does n’t bother me , i know the dangers involved			0
' i worry a lot more about him , his close escape effects me more than mine			0
' in @entity12 's @entity59 - winning film @entity58 , an @entity112 army captain , played by @entity61 , and his team endeavours to find private @entity13 , played by @entity67			0
set during @entity63 , following the invasion of @entity133 , private @entity13 is the last - surviving brother out of four servicemen			0
good to be home : when the brothers told their mother about the incidents she called them ' idiots ' following @entity143 orders to return private @entity13 to his mother safely , @entity61 's character is given the task			2
the @entity41 soldiers said their parents @entity148 and @entity149 found it difficult to have them both away at the same time			0
@entity44 said : ' we told our dad first about the bomb blasts because he understands that these things happen			0
' but when we told mum about both being blown up she called us idiots			0
' the brothers have three siblings , @entity161 , 20 , @entity162 , 15 and 14 - year - old brother @entity163 .			0
