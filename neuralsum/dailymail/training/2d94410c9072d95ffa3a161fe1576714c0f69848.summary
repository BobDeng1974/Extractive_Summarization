as the ebola virus continues to rip through west @entity1 , with more than 4,000 killed , @entity2 is sending hospital ship @entity3 to help combat the deadly disease			1
while this rescue mission is not set to arrive for several days , captain @entity6 , 86 , has told of his experience being sent to fight the first @entity10 outbreak in @entity1 in 1976			1
cpt masters was serving in the army when word began spreading of a then - unknown virus killing thousands of villagers living along the @entity16 in @entity17 - from where the disease takes its name			1
captain @entity6 was leading expeditions across @entity1 in the seventies when he was recruited to hand out medical supplies along the @entity16 in @entity17 , where a then - unknown virus had killed thousands cpt masters ( left , without a shirt ) greets fellow explorer @entity27 during an expedition along the @entity30 shortly before he was tasked with containing the first @entity10 outbreak the forces had no information on where the infection had come from or how it was being spread			1
all they knew was that it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected			1
cpt masters had previously lead an expedition down the @entity30 , and was taking another mission into @entity17 when he was recruited by the country 's top doctor to help distribute medical supplies			1
dr @entity45 , personal physician to @entity17 president @entity46 , asked him to go into the infection zone and help set up a quarantine zone			1
masters ' orders were to set up the zone , then fly a specialist @entity53 medical team in by helicopter			1
after the team were in , @entity11 was to keep the them supplied with whatever they needed , and help collect samples from victims to be sent back to the @entity53 for analysis			2
he said : ' i was n’t really scared , mainly out of ignorance			0
' one day i was sent for to be told that a deadly fever was killing hundreds of people in the @entity66 , and was concentrated near a river called @entity10			0
when @entity11 was sent to help contain the epidemic , nobody knew where the virus came from or how it was spread , they only knew it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected ' the sick were going to a catholic mission hospital hoping to get help			1
sadly at this stage , little could be done as the fever had no history			0
it was killing more than 90 per cent of those who contracted it			1
' dr close had been aware of the true nature of the threat and sent for an investigative team from the @entity53			0
' there was plenty of information about what was happening , but none on why			0
its source and carriers were unknown			0
' the fear was that it could spread into other areas , even to population centres like @entity99 , the capital , and from there to anywhere in the world			0
' it is believed that fruit bats were the original carriers of @entity10 , but spread it to other animals such as chimpanzees , gorillas , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines through bites or faeces			0
the disease is then thought to have passed into humans through contact with the blood , bodily fluids , or dead bodies of infected animals found lying in the rainforest			0
in humans the virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days			0
once a person begins to show symptoms they become infectious , and can spread the disease through blood or bodily fluids			0
after several days in @entity17 , @entity129 managed to set up supplies sub-depot in each of the country ’s nine regions the affected area was put on lock - down			1
he was asked to get the world ’s leading experts to the centre of the epidemic - the @entity66 - so chartered planes and army helicopters to @entity142			2
the team arrived at the hospital staffed by @entity146 and @entity147 catholic missionaries and government staff			0
he recalled : ' no air or river movements were permitted in or out of that part of @entity66 and the almost impossible task of preventing overland movements was put in hand			0
' perhaps in a more developed part of the world this could not have been done successfully , but in @entity17 the cordon was complete			1
' my task was to get the team of researchers , including dr @entity164 , one of the world ’s leading experts on tropical fevers , to the site by plane and helicopter , keep them supplied with whatever they needed and to collect medical samples which would be flown to the @entity53 for further studies			2
captain masters ( second left ) is pictured sailing between the remote @entity177 in @entity178 shortly before being sent to deal with the first @entity10 outbreak ' there also needed to be a withdrawal system should things go badly wrong for the team , and one , or more , of their number be struck down with fever			2
' i went in with the first team , taking a couple of my craftsmen to set up a field laboratory at the mission hospital			2
' speaking of the medics , he said : ' i was lost in admiration for them as already members of the staff had died at their posts from the effects of the fever			1
' [ the outbreak ] left me with a lifelong admiration for those who battle sickness and disease			2
' i came to realise that it is not just enough to find cures for the illnesses we already know about but to be on guard against the new developments which evolve with life itself			0
