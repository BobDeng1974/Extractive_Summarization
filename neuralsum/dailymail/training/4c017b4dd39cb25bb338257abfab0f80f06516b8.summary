since the age of 11 @entity1 had dreamt of a marriage day with all the traditional vows			1
but only hours before she was due to tie the knot , her hopes were shattered ... when a registrar ruled the words ‘ to have and to hold , in sickness and in health ’ were too religious for their civil ceremony			2
the 39 - year - old and her new husband @entity13 , 43 , had instead to say ‘ hold and have ’ and ‘ in sickness and when we are well ’			2
@entity13 and @entity1 were told by the registrar that the wording of their wedding vows was too religious they were told the traditional vows were too @entity24 because of their roots in the @entity26			1
yet a minor tweak of the wording satisfied the officials			0
mrs @entity1 found the process so ridiculous she burst into a fit of giggles during the ceremony at @entity35 ’s @entity34 , a historic @entity37 theatre in the @entity38 of @entity39			1
her husband , who is a barrister , stumbled over his new lines			0
‘ the vows are so important , ’ said mrs @entity1			1
‘ they have just stood the test of time , they sound like poetry , they flow beautifully and they are just the form of words that you expect at a wedding			0
ever since i was 11 i just imagined that they would be the words i would use when i married my husband			0
‘ it just seems ridiculous that words which do n’t mention religion could be so problematic			0
’ there is much confusion surrounding the law on civil weddings			0
the 1949 @entity62 states that ‘ no religious service shall be used at any marriage solemnised in the presence of a superintendent registrar ’			1
eight years ago , however , the rules were relaxed to allow a limited amount of material that makes reference to religion – even the @entity73 song @entity74			0
stunning venue : mr and mrs @entity1 married at @entity35 's @entity34 in @entity39 's @entity38 on saturday it is now for register offices to interpret the law as they see fit			1
the couple had spent months arranging their wedding and they believed they had agreed on the content of their vows at a meeting with @entity90 registrars in february			2
on the afternoon before the ceremony , however , an official told mrs @entity1 she could not legally get married without a change of wording			1
‘ the registrar said she would not be able to marry us with these words and could i rewrite them over the phone , ’ said the pr executive			2
‘ i just thought i ca n’t be rude , i ca n’t be offensive , because i have got to stand in front of her tomorrow and pledge my life to my husband			0
’ during his speech later on in the evening , mr @entity105 read out his original vows to his new wife			0
‘ taking his lead , during my speech i said the words to him that we had originally chosen , ’ mrs @entity1 said			1
‘ it was incredibly romantic and got a standing ovation from our guests			0
’ @entity90 said its officials feared the original vows breached ‘ the relevant legality process ’			1
a spokesman added : ‘ we apologise for the short notice that @entity105 and mrs @entity1 received regarding changes to their chosen vows			1
‘ we worked closely with the couple to ensure the vows they exchanged on their special day were as close as possible to those initially chosen by them			2

@entity13 and @entity1 were told their chosen vows were ' too religious '
registrar called mrs @entity1 , *33* , day before and told her to rewrite them
couple *picked* civil wedding at @entity35 's @entity34 in @entity39 's @entity38
@entity138 simply says ' no religious service will be used '
@entity141 says officials feared vows breached rules
