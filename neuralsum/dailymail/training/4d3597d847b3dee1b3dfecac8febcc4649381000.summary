by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 04:20 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 10 july 2012 determined : roads minister @entity3 has vowed the motorway will reopen on schedule fears that the @entity8 fiasco may continue beyond thursday were sparked today as the minister responsible insisted that meeting the deadline was only a ‘ hope ’ and not a certainty			2
concerns rose as roads minister @entity3 said the key section of the @entity15 in west @entity16 may have cracked as a result of earlier repair work at the site - on a key @entity21 route into the capital			1
but he backtracked on suggestions by the government ’s own @entity24 that the thursday deadline to finish the work and end the chaos would be met , venturing only that this was ‘ highly possible ’ but also ‘ very difficult '			2
transport department officials also sought to put the brakes on suggestions that the repairs would definitely be finished as promised by thursday , ending five days of chaos affecting more than half a million motorists			2
a spokesman said : ’ we ca n’t absolutely guarantee it			0
the best estimate is that the road will open on thursday			1
’ on a visit to the stricken motorway , which is shut for six miles between junctions two and three , mr @entity3 said : ‘ the crack that caused the shut was n’t there before			1
’ he said it was a ‘ brand new crack , possibly due to the work we were doing			1
’ the @entity50 viaduct was closed between junctions one and three , from @entity52 to @entity53 , on thursday night after the cracks in the steel supports were discovered			0
a ‘ severe ’ alert for congestion remains in place			0
the closure of the key @entity8 section between junctions 2 and 3 has led to knock - on congestion on other gridlocked roads as far as the @entity65 turn - off into @entity66 in south - west @entity16 , where frustrated commuters faced waits of up to an hour			1
the @entity70 route is a major road link from @entity16 to the @entity72 and @entity73 , as well as a heavily - used commuter route			1
@entity16 mayor @entity75 said it was vital the repairs were completed ' as speedily as possible '			1
frustrating : the gridlock is causing road misery for 165,000 drivers every day repair job : a group of road workers get to work on fixing the cracked section of the motorway in @entity16 mr @entity3 said today : ‘ last thursday evening they found a crack in one of the areas where they were already working that was n’t there the last time they looked			1
they checked it again and it was growing because the traffic was coming on top			0
' he said it would be a ‘ catastrophic failure ’ if the bridge were left broken and engineers wanted to fix it ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
he said : ‘ i 'm hoping they will start work on that this afternoon , plating it together , and as predicted right at the start we hope to have it open on thursday morning			0
’ furious commuters stuck in traffic on the @entity8 have found one way to fill their time - tweeting about it			1
but is anyone listening ? here 's what they are saying : pressed again , he refused to give any guarantees that the road would reopen on thursday , as the @entity24 predicted today and yesterday			2
he said : ‘ that ’s what we ’d like to do , it ’s highly possible			0
’ @entity121 , the agency ’s director of delivery and development said the new crack was a two - and - a - half inch - deep gash in the welded supports			1
he said : ' the crack was n’t there before and was growing , which caused a hiccup in the repair process			1
' the bridge is supported by 10ft - wide concrete pillars and underpinned by a lattice of steel girders			2
workmen are grinding down the cracks and filling them with reinforcement plates			0
the @entity24 said it has inspected 1,000 cracks , of which 64 needed repair and most have been completed			2
however , even if the road reopens on thursday , there will be only four days to ensure the flyover is safe before the @entity146 lane opens on monday			2
the @entity70 is expected to be one of the busiest routes during the @entity146 because it links the city and @entity150 in @entity151 with @entity152			1
professor @entity153 , director of the @entity154 , said : ‘ after the queues at @entity152 , now there ’s disruption on the @entity70			1
' the @entity24 says a crack has been found at a " sensitive location "			2
too right it has - on the main route in and out of the capital for international visitors			1
' this raises big question marks about our ability to look after what we already have , let alone provide new infrastructure			0
' cracks : white paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the @entity175 flyover which need fixing before the @entity21 starts			1
the cracks were first spotted four months ago jam : traffic filters off the @entity8 approaching the closed section at the weekend			0
while part of it has now re-opened , one section is expected to remain shut for another three days the @entity70 chaos is costing road users tens of thousands a day in missed appointments , late deliveries , taxi hire and extra fuel , according to the @entity190			1
around 825,000 drivers will be affected over the five days in which the motorway linking @entity152 and @entity193 is being shut			1
@entity195 is now demanding answers from ministers on the impact of cuts to road maintenance budgets , which could be the reason for delaying improvement works until they became crucial			1
the party has also raised questions over the readiness of contingency plans for the @entity21 and @entity146			0
@entity3 mp , @entity195 ’s @entity207 , said : ' it is astonishing that with less than twenty days to go before the @entity209 , a key part of the @entity70 to @entity152 will be shut for several days			1
' the @entity24 has known about issues with the viaduct for at least four months , so motorway users will be asking why there has been a panicked closure of the road weeks before the @entity146			1
' ministers need to confirm that there are contingency plans in place , so that another failure of the @entity70 would not jeopardise the @entity146			0
the @entity223 - led government also needs to urgently review the impact of its £ 435m cuts to road maintenance budgets and whether they have contributed to this mess			1
' empty : this stretch of the @entity8 near @entity16 from the @entity72 is still completely closed for emergency maintenance stuck : the @entity231 ( @entity232 ) is a key diversion route but was at a virtual standstill yesterday business leaders spoke of their anger yesterday after it was revealed that the problems are set to last at least five days , despite the fissures between junctions 1 and 3 being discovered in march			1
the @entity241 said the closure would be ‘ economically damaging ’ , while the boss of @entity158 ’s biggest private hire taxi company called the closure ‘ disastrous ’ and a ‘ failure of investment in the road network ’			1
it is the latest road closure on the vital route from @entity152 – along which about 80 per cent of traffic to the @entity21 is expected to travel			1
at @entity252 , the @entity232 – which links to the @entity70 – was closed after cracks were discovered in the @entity255 flyover			2
it did n’t fully reopen for five months			0
it would be a pr disaster for @entity260 organisers if the @entity70 restrictions were still in place when the @entity146 begin in three weeks			0
the road has been reopened between junction 1 and 2 to relieve the pressure on @entity52 roundabout			1
congestion has spread as far afield as the @entity268 , @entity232 , @entity269 , and even @entity65 in @entity270 as drivers heeded the @entity24 's warning to find ' alternative routes ' into the capital			0
jam : even an @entity21 official 's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters repairs have begun on the @entity70 elevated section in west @entity16 after cracks were found in the bridge section @entity284 , director general of the @entity241 , was one of the motorists held up in jams caused by the closure			2
he said : ‘ it is fortunate that at least this was spotted before any accident occurred , but it will still be economically damaging			0
‘ closing the @entity70 so soon after the @entity292 will come as a blow to many			0
the motorways are major arteries for the nation ’s businesses , transporting people to work and goods to customers			0
‘ this infrastructure is crucial to economic success , and having two major road closures in a few months simply is n’t good enough			2
’ @entity304 , boss of @entity305 , @entity16 ’s largest private taxi firm , said yesterday : ‘ this is yet another disaster for the roads network , and highlights the lack of investment in key infrastructure			0
‘ this wholly preventable disaster could not come at a worst time – a few days before the @entity21			0
’ mr @entity313 said the incident showed motorway structures across @entity158 were ‘ showing their age ’			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a close shave , the timing is shocking with the @entity21 so close			0
i expect the @entity24 are quite nervous about it			0
we just hope it is fixed by thursday , because it is the most vital artery			2
’ blocked : the closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the @entity175 , just west of junction 2 the new secondary crack causing the current crisis is part of a £ 4million repair project at the @entity175			1
a @entity24 spokesman said : ‘ we are putting all our efforts into completing the repairs by thursday			0
‘ drivers heading into @entity16 are still advised to seek alternative routes via the @entity268 and @entity269 and are advised to plan for and leave extra time for their journeys			0
’ diversion routes via the @entity232 / @entity339 were registering delays of 20 minutes in both directions			2
the @entity24 added : ’ we are aware that congestion has also increased on @entity16 's roads			0
while we do not have access to data for those routes not on our network , we continue to liaise with @entity348 and the relevant local authorities and will make whatever changes are needed to help keep traffic moving in and out of @entity16			0
‘ we are continuing to monitor the traffic situation and will review our plans if necessary			0
’ into the city : the @entity70 , part of the @entity356 , will be vital for transporting visitors into @entity16 video : video of the chaotic traffic or lack thereof on the @entity8 as it is closed for repairs ...			1

@entity231 shut between junction 2 and 3 causing one - hour delays
@entity195 attacks @entity366 over last - minute works , pointing the finger at £ 435m cuts to road maintenance budgets
vital commuter route links @entity152 and @entity193
business chiefs say the late closure will be costly and potentially disastrous
