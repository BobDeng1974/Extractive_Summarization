every parent thinks of their own offspring as a little angel			2
but for @entity5 and @entity6 the comparison is closer than most			2
their two - year - old son @entity7 was born with a rare skin condition that makes him look like he has feathered wings across his upper back			1
the unusual mark runs half way down his spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades			2
but it must be checked by doctors at least every three months , his wings may turn lethal			1
but it must be checked by doctors at least every three months , his wings may turn lethal baby love : @entity7 with his mother , @entity39			1
his parents have been told he will live a full and healthy life unless the condition spreads to his brain or spine			1
he also faces an increased risk of aggressive skin cancer @entity7 was at birth diagnosed with @entity48 ( @entity49 ) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred			1
despite the diagnosis @entity7 is likely to live a full and healthy life , but he must be careful : children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer			1
because of that , he has to wear a sunsuit and prescription sunscreen to protect him from the sun 's uv rays			2
there is also a risk of the condition spreading to the brain or spine , where the lesions and moles could cripple his nervous system			1
mrs @entity6 , 34 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , told @entity74 's news service : ' [ @entity7 ] is one of the fortunate ones			2
some children are riddled with moles and even get them on their eyelids			2
' he actually has his on the top half of his back so it looks like wings			0
there can be lots of questions because it comes up to the nape of his neck and so is visible			0
' as he gets older we would hope he can accept himself for who he is			0
we have all got these bits of ourselves that we do not like and we have to accept them			0
' he is wonderful the way he is and i 'm sure in the dark times he will realise this			0
' he is lucky in the sense he is such a cutie pop , everyone seems to think so , and i think people will overlook his condition			1
' new baby : @entity7 pictured at birth , when he was first diagnosed with @entity48 ( @entity49 ) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred @entity109 : the latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of @entity49 cases is a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb , said @entity116 of the @entity117 now help group precious : babies and children with @entity49 have regular mri scans to check the spread of the condition @entity7 attends @entity124 in @entity125 every three months for a check - up			1
doctors examine the moles to see if any are turning cancerous and @entity7 is given mri scans to see if he has developed any tumours on his brain or spine			1
@entity116 of the @entity117 now help group , said : ' children with @entity49 have to be very careful			0
' there is an increased risk of cancer so factor 50 sun cream is a must and we now have uv protection clothing which can be used			1
' but it 's also important to let them have their childhood and the kids still need vitamin @entity145 ' sometimes the birthmarks can break down and crack so they have to have cream to help them			1
' in some cases it turns into @entity49 syndrome which sees pigmentation on the brain and spine which can cause fits and stop development and can be fatal when tumours develop			1
' in children with @entity49 the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it 's untreatable once it reaches the brain			1
' our latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of @entity49 cases and it 's caused by a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb			0
' this is why it 's so important to give babies mri scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads			0
' charity work : @entity7 with his seven - year - old brother @entity178 and other pupils at @entity180 , which is helping to raise money for caring matters now by staging a 10km fun run ms @entity116 said likening children 's birthmarks to shapes lets them know they are special			2
' when children have interesting shaped birthmarks it 's a great way of telling them them about the condition and letting them know they are special , ' she said			1
' @entity7 's mum does it by telling him he has angel wings			0
' my own daughter has one on her leg shaped like a paw print and that was a great way of telling her about it			0
' @entity7 's seven year - old brother @entity178 's school , @entity203 , is holding a 10k fun run to raise money for @entity117			0
@entity7 was diagnosed with @entity48 ( @entity49 ) - moles or birthmarks which are present at birth and usually oversized			1
@entity49 stands for : though @entity49 means birthmark or mole at birth , around 1 per cent of @entity49 appear after birth , usually in the first year of life			0
the condition affects 1 per cent of people and having it means there is a risk that lesions and moles can also grow on the brain			1
this is called @entity49 syndrome , which can cause fits and stop development			0
if tumours develop , it can be fatal			0
children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of being diagnosed with malignant melanoma , the most lethal form of skin cancer			2
as a result , they must wear factor 50 sun cream and wear clothing with uv protection , if possible			0
' in children with @entity49 the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it 's untreatable once it reaches the brain , ’ said @entity116 of the @entity117 now help group			2
research has shown the majority of @entity49 cases are caused by a mutated gene			0
' therefore why it 's so important to give babies mri scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads , ’ said ms @entity116			0
