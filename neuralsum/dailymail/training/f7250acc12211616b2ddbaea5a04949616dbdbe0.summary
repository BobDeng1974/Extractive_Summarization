by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 announced his arrival at @entity4 with a typically late 2 - 1 win over @entity6 in @entity8 's final pre-season game			1
@entity9 missed a penalty before an emotional @entity11 opened the scoring in the second - half and misfit @entity15 netted a late winner , despite being linked with a move away from the club			1
no question that he is @entity8 's first - choice after a superb campaign last time out			1
@entity39 - 7 better in possession and made one outstanding recovery tackle as @entity42 bore down on goal			2
still prone to a lapse of concentration but the potential is there			0
@entity48 - 6.5 smart on the ball and robust in the challenge			0
some at @entity4 had their doubts last season but looks the part in the 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
@entity56 - 6.5 favoured ahead of @entity57 and impressed again at centre - back			0
@entity59 will increase competition in the left centre - back position but @entity56 deserves some opportunities this season			0
@entity64 selected to lead @entity23 ' revival on the spot : @entity9 was made captain for the evening but missed a first - half penalty @entity69 - 6 hard - working at wing - back and impressive delivery			1
still has his limitations but can not fault his dedication or work ethic under @entity76			0
@entity11 - 7.5 an inspiring tale of courage is having a happy ending			1
@entity11 looks back to his dynamic best and is forming a good understanding with @entity81			2
@entity83 - 45 ? @entity84 was given a rare start despite being linked with a move away from @entity8 @entity81 - 7 some brilliant passing in the midfield and athletic work in recovering position			1
he will be vitally important to @entity8 this season			2
@entity93 - 6 two years ago , he 'd been released by @entity94			0
now he 's playing at @entity4 for @entity8			1
@entity93 is only 20 and getting improving rapidly			0
reliable back - up for @entity96 but @entity97 remains on the @entity8 horizon			1
play maker : new signing @entity81 ( r ) helped dictate the tempo of the game from midfield @entity104 - 5.5 quiet in the hole behind the forwards but linked up well on occasion with @entity9 and @entity81			1
needs to influence the game more but nobody can question his talent			0
@entity9 - 5.5 frustrating evening			1
exaggerated the fall to win a penalty and then lashed it against the post			0
touch also let him down a couple of times in front of goal			0
@entity8 captain on the night did not stop running and working for his team , though			2
change of system : @entity69 was given another opportunity to impress in the wing - back role @entity84 - 5.5 typically effervescent and sprightly in the final third but unable to convert with one header from close range			2
admittedly the service could have been better			0
substitute ratings @entity131 ( for @entity48 62 ) - 6 industrious and brought energy at a time @entity8 looked a little rattled			1
@entity133 ( for @entity134 ) - 5.5 like @entity104 , barely featured as a link between midfield and attack			0
eastern promise ? @entity133 failed to impress after coming on for @entity104 @entity139 ( for @entity11 , 62 ) - 5.5 sliced clearance handed the goal to @entity6			1
has enjoyed a good pre-season but not the @entity4 homecoming he 'd have hoped for			1
@entity145 ( for @entity104 , 62 ) - 6 talented youngster but does n't quite look ready			0
if @entity8 bring in the defenders they are chasing , expect him to leave on loan to a @entity151 club			2
@entity152 and @entity153 lead the chase			0
@entity15 ( for @entity81 , 76 ) - 7 cruel treatment from @entity8 supporters , ironically applauding every touch			1
classless from the fans and good on him for responding with a goal			0
even if there may have been a foul on the goalkeeper ... fancy a slice ? @entity165 played a part in @entity6 's equaliser after a decent pre-season @entity169 ( for @entity84 , 76 ) - 6.5 the @entity170 showed glimpses of the qualities that lit up @entity4 last season			1
interesting to see how @entity76 finds room for him in the 3 - 5 - 2			2
too good to leave out , really			0
