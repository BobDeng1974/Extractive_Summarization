plus - size fashion is a hard market to crack			1
many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress			0
and that is exactly why @entity9 , who pioneered the first - ever plus - size fashion week , want to change that			1
the high street store , which falls under sir @entity15 's @entity14 umbrella , has set up an initiative with universities to teach students how to design plus - size clothes for the brand 's @entity9 range			1
they 've cracked it : cut for @entity9 is a new range designed for fuller - figured women by two university students ( cardigan , £ 45 ) @entity28 wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus - size			1
so , she asked students from @entity34 and @entity35 to design a 6 - piece collection that was fashion forward and not limited by size			1
a judging panel of industry experts collectively selected a winner from each @entity35 and included : @entity42 ( editor at @entity44 ) , @entity45 ( lifestyle editor at @entity47 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 and @entity50 ) , and @entity51 ( @entity41 , @entity52 )			0
each of the winning designs will receive a £ 1,000 cash prize and see their collection launched in selected @entity9 stores and online across the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 this week			2
changing face of fashion : @entity28 wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus - size ( top , £ 50 , trousers , £ 45 ) winning : each of the winning designers , including @entity70 from @entity34 , whose designs are pictured , will see them land in stores @entity73 said of the project : ' cut is an exciting opportunity for students to learn and develop as designers and challenges what they have been taught			1
' it pushes them to create something that can be bold yet beautiful , regardless of size that empowers and delights all at once and ultimately changes attitudes about plus size and its fashion credentials			0
' @entity88 is a second year student from @entity35 studying a @entity89 ( @entity90 ) in @entity91			0
she took inspiration from vintage fabrics to create a sophisticated yet technical collection of wearable knitwear			0
whilst @entity70 , a @entity96 student at @entity34 , created a collection of vibrant kaleidoscopic prints drawn from portraits of inspirational women throughout history			0
a spokesperson for @entity9 , which stocks sizes 14 - 32 , said : ' we are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry and our commitment to cut for @entity9 highlights how we believe great fashion design can be aspirational and inclusive			1
' so what do the plus - size industry think ? @entity115 , editor @entity113 magazine , an aspirational fashion and lifestyle for women with curves , said : ' we feel that @entity120 is possibly the most important and exciting collaboration of any plus - size brand at the moment			1
' as a former design student , i have been long aware and exposed to the fact that our university programs are n't preparing designers for the plus - size market , a retail industry that is currently booming			2
' @entity120 is both an educational experience for design students as well as a really exciting way of breathing new life into the industry			2
by inviting students to design for @entity9 , they are opening their eyes to designing for varying body shapes and a consumer , not just a fantasy subject			2
' from the results of both the last collaboration and the new collection , they are producing some really great prints and designs that are both wearable and beautiful , showing that plus - size women do n't have to shy away from print and colour			2
' all wrapped up : @entity88 is a second year student from @entity35 who took inspiration from vintage fabrics to create a sophisticated yet technical collection of wearable knitwear cosy knits : a spokesperson for @entity9 , which stocks sizes 14 - 32 , said : ' we are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry ' fashion writer @entity161 said of the range : ' plus - size fashion has thankfully come on a long way , the days of just awfully cut , boxy shapes and elasticated waist trousers are long gone			1
from this brilliant design project , @entity9 are offering plus - size women some amazing pieces that can be dressed up and down , for all occasions			1
' as someone who used to be very big , i struggled to find anything that was fashion forward			0
bigger girlfriends had the same problem			0
but @entity70 's brilliant prints put an end to all that			0
and who ever said knitted dresses were not for big people can think again ... @entity88 's must - have dress cleverly contours the body , drawing in the eye to the smallest part of the waist			0
' both these collections are worth investing in : having separates like these in your wardrobe means you can create multiple outfits			0
that red knitted longline sleeveless cardigan is the ultimate for this season ! ' well done @entity9			0
' progress : fashion writer @entity161 said of the range : ' plus - size fashion has thankfully come on a long way , the days of just awfully cut , boxy shapes and elasticated waist trousers are long gone ' ( jacket , £ 55 )			1
