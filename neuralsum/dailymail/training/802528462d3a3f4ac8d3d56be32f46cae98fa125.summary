by @entity0 published : 13:34 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 13 november 2013 it seems that all the things we believe about flu are myths			0
a study has revealed that crowded public transport does n't increase the risk of catching the bug and that ' man - flu ' does n't even exist			2
in fact , children are the greatest spreaders of flu and women are most likely to catch it			1
contrary to popular belief , people who use public transport are no more likely to get flu than those who do not it also found that teenage women , specifically those living north of the @entity23 , are the most likely to get the flu			1
the findings are part of the annual @entity27 , now in its fifth year , which seeks to finds out who will get the flu each winter and maps out how the flu spreads across the nation			0
the @entity34 @entity27 reported people in @entity36 and @entity37 are slightly more likely to report having flu - like symptoms than people living in the @entity23 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
smokers are 12 per cent more likely to report having flu - like symptoms than non-smokers while people who have sustained contact with children are 17 per cent more likely to report flu - like symptoms			1
school children are most likely to report having flu and women report suffering the symptoms 18 per cent more than men staying off the train or bus does n't stop you getting flu - results suggest that people who regularly use public transport are no more likely to develop flu - like illnesses than people who do not use public transport			1
dr @entity62 , from the @entity63 , said : ' last year we found that taking public transport does not increase your risk of catching flu and we discovered that " man flu " did n’t really exist - in fact women were slightly more likely to report feeling worse when they have flu than men			1
' this year we ’re keen to find out more about children because they are the " key spreaders " of flu and the group who reported the most flu - like illness in last year ’s survey			1
' with the @entity78 beginning to roll out childhood flu vaccinations this year , it ’s an exciting time to see how this might change the way the virus spreads			0
' @entity34 @entity27 collects data through an online questionnaire at flusurvey.org.uk from men , women and children of all ages around the country in order to map trends as seasonal flu takes hold			2
the data enables researchers to analyse how the virus spreads and who it affects			0
more than 6,000 people took part in the @entity27 last year			0
dr @entity100 added : ' catching flu can be serious , potentially fatal in some cases			0
' if participants can spare just a couple of minutes each week providing us with crucial data , we will increase our knowledge of flu and develop new methods to improve the handling of outbreaks of the virus			0
' researchers want members of the public and schools across the @entity34 to sign up to help collect as much data as possible in order to map this year ’s flu trends and to help medics and health services prepare			0
traditional monitoring methods rely on data from gps or hospitals , but @entity27 provides a unique insight because many people with flu - like illness do not visit a doctor .			2

teenage girls living in the @entity36 are most likely to get the flu
children are the *primary* spreaders of the illness and women are 18 *%* more likely to develop symptoms than men - smokers are also more likely to suffer
people in @entity36 and @entity37 are more likely to get flu than those in the @entity23 , @entity40 and @entity41
