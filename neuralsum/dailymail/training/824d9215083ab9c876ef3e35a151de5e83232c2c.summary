by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:32 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 11:02 est , 22 december 2012 the number of cases of whooping cough has jumped from 944 last year to nearly 9,000 this year , according to the latest figures after doctors up and down the country have dealt with an influx of patients suffering from norovirus , followed up by a wave of flu patients , medical staff are now gearing themselves for people needing help for whooping cough			1
the number of cases of whooping cough cases has jumped from 944 last year to 8,819 so far in 2012 , according to the latest figures from the @entity20 , with 1,080 coming in november alone			1
at the end of september , the @entity21 announced a vaccination programme for pregnant women , but the @entity20 has said it is still too early for this to have had an impact on the number of cases			1
the @entity21 has however recently reported an uptake of around 40 per cent in pregnant women			0
the total of 1,080 cases in november was in fact a decrease from october when 1,631 cases were reported for @entity34 and @entity35 , the first decrease in monthly numbers since the current outbreak started in the middle of last year			1
but , the @entity20 has warned a decrease in cases is usually seen at this time of year so does not necessarily represent the end of this severe outbreak			1
dr @entity44 , consultant epidemiologist for immunisation at the @entity20 , said : ' the november figures show a welcome decrease of whooping cough cases since october			1
' however , it is very important to note that we usually see a reduction in cases of whooping cough at this time of year so this decrease is in line with normal seasonal patterns			1
' the recent announcement that at least 40 per cent of pregnant women received the whooping cough vaccine in the first month of the programme is very encouraging			2
' we would like to remind pregnant women how serious this infection can be in young babies and how it can in some cases cause death			0
' vaccination between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy should offer babies the best protection against whooping cough before they receive their own vaccines			2
' as well as this , parents should ensure their children are vaccinated against whooping cough on time , even babies of women who ’ve had the vaccine in pregnancy – this is to continue their baby ’s protection through childhood			1
' at least 40 per cent of pregnant woman have taken up the whooping cough vaccination since it was rolled out in september whooping cough , also known as pertussis , affects all ages			2
young infants are at highest risk of severe complications and death from whooping cough as babies do not complete vaccination until they are around four months old			1
in older children and adults whooping cough can be an unpleasant illness but it does not usually lead to serious complications			1
dr @entity44 said : ' parents should also be alert to the signs and symptoms of whooping cough – which include severe coughing fits accompanied by the characteristic “ whoop ” sound in young children but as a prolonged cough in older children or adults			1
' meanwhile , parents have also been warned the flu season has begun following an increase in the number of children aged five to 14 falling ill. the winter flu season has kicked off , parents have been warned , after an increase in the number of school children falling ill with the infection doctors were yesterday given the green light to prescribe antiviral medication to those who need it and people most at risk of the infection were urged to have a flu jab			1
dr @entity128 , head of seasonal flu surveillance at the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) said : ' we are seeing an increase in flu activity mainly among school children indicating the start of this year 's flu season			1
' flu cases in children aged five to 14 have doubled in the past week to reach almost 17 cases per 100,000			1
and the worst affected area of the country appears to be @entity140 , according to a @entity142 survey			1
the news comes as thousands of people around the country continue to be hit by the winter vomiting bug , with nearly 900,000 people thought to be affected			0
the start of the flu season will add pressure on hospitals struggling with record levels of norovirus			0
since oct 1 , 51 people have been admitted to intensive care with flu and three people have died , according to the @entity157			0
overall last week there were 23 gp consultations per 100,000 people , high enough to trigger the use of antiviral medication in vulnerable patients			0
@entity164 occurs most often in winter and usually peaks between december and march in the northern hemisphere			0
and it is not too late to have a vaccination , doctors have advised			0
dr @entity128 said : ‘ flu vaccination is still the most effective way of preventing flu and it is not too late to get it so we would encourage all those who are in “ at risk ” groups to get vaccinated as they are more vulnerable to developing complications from flu			2
maintaining good cough and hand hygiene , such as covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough and sneeze , disposing of the tissue as soon as possible and cleaning your hands as soon you can are important actions that can help prevent the spread of germs and reduce the risk of transmission			0
symptoms include a sudden fever , cough , sore throat , as well as aching muscles and joints			0
the best treatment for otherwise healthy people is to stay at home and rest , drink plenty of fluids and take pain relief			0
under - 16s should not take medicine containing aspirin			0
@entity20 expert dr @entity128 added : ‘ although unpleasant , flu is a self - limiting illness and if you have flu it is best to stay at home until you are well			2
if people in at risk groups develop symptoms consistent with flu , or if anyone ’s symptoms persist or become more severe , we advise they seek medical advice			1
’ to see the current guidance for prescribing antivirals please go to : @entity226			0
it does not recommend antivirals for the prevention of flu in otherwise healthy people under 65 , even if they have been in close contact with someone with a flu - like illness			2
‘ these include people with underlying conditions such as heart problems , diabetes , lung , liver or renal diseases and those with weakened immune systems , as well as older people and pregnant women			0
‘ latest vaccine uptake figures for one of the ‘ at risk ’ groups – the over 65 age group – are encouraging , with more than 70 per cent taking up the offer of the flu vaccine			2
‘ we do however continue to encourage people in clinical “ at risk ” groups , as well as healthcare workers and carers who could pass the infection to vulnerable people , to ensure they are vaccinated			2
' anti-viral drugs should be administered for people at risk of developing complications from flu , the @entity20 has said			2
the drugs reduce the severity of the disease , shorten it by an average of one day and may help to limit the spread			0
dr @entity128 added : ‘ as levels of flu have started to increase , the @entity20 has recommended that antivirals should be used for the treatment and prevention of flu in those who are at risk of serious complications			1
the use of antivirals is recommended each year when flu is considered to be circulating in the community			2
’ the @entity284 is ready for the flu outbreak , a senior official said			0
chief medical officer professor dame @entity286 said : " the @entity284 is well prepared for an increase in winter - related health problems , including flu			0
‘ nearly half of under - 65s who are most at risk from flu , including children , have already had the flu jab			1
we urge patients who are most at risk from flu and who have not yet had their vaccine to contact their gp as soon as possible			0
’ @entity20 figures show the number of children affected by fever is significantly higher than this time last year dr @entity309 , @entity310 at the @entity142 , who is running the @entity313 @entity312 project which tracks the regions most affected , said : ‘ ' the data are very preliminary and flu levels are still very low but overall the results suggest that the @entity34 region most affected by flu is the @entity140 with 19,200 per 100,000			1
' we now need more people to sign up and let us know how they are feeling so we can study these figures in greater depth and increase our understanding of seasonal flu			0
