what @entity0 did here , particularly in the first hour of his innings , was spot - on			1
that has to be his template from now on and if he carries on the way he has played here in @entity9 , those hundreds will come again			0
this was really encouraging for the @entity12 captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he could n’t push on to that all - important hundred			1
@entity0 ’s problem has been opponents stopping him scoring in areas where he has always been prolific			0
he has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before			0
@entity0 's innings into day three in @entity9 was spot on , particularly the first hour of it @entity0 worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing @entity23 on for 76 yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 test hundreds can not drive the ball			1
the key for him is not to play the drive too early , when the ball is moving around and his balance at the crease is not quite right			0
perhaps it has been playing too much one - day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but @entity0 has been searching for the ball far too early			1
here he left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him , which took a lot of mental strength and composure			2
the drag - on was always going to be a danger on this pitch but @entity0 was right to try to play that shot because the cut is one of his big strengths			0
his eyes lit up when he was bowled a short , wide one by @entity23			0
but the ball just lacked pace , @entity0 was through the shot too early , the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play			2
he can not admonish himself for playing at the delivery			0
boy , do i admire @entity0 ’s fortitude and the concentration he showed on that sluggish pitch with an incredibly slow outfield			0
the @entity12 captain hits behind square on the onside as @entity67 ducks for cover @entity0 left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him , but drove when the option arose he is stronger mentally than anyone he will face , so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline			1
the bowlers will become bored before he does			0
the fact is , 76 here was pretty much worth a hundred in these day - three conditions , but sadly for @entity0 that is not how the record books will show it			2
the @entity12 captain was aided by the fact the ball did not swing much for @entity82 , because it is the moving delivery that has caused him so many problems			1
it is to @entity0 ’s credit that he has not looked under pressure in this second test and his recent statistics — four scores of 70 - plus in his last seven test innings — are absolutely fine for a normal human being			2
the problem for him is that until the age of 28 he was n’t normal ; he was an absolute run machine			0
@entity0 's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from @entity23 found the inside edge the skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short @entity23 celebrates after @entity0 's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early @entity82 celebrate the breakthrough but @entity0 can not admonish himself for playing at the delivery @entity0 just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures , then move on with such a big summer ahead			1
his inability to do so means we are still talking about how long it ’s been since his last test century but there were good signs here			0
meanwhile , @entity117 still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings , certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to			1
@entity117 drives during his first innings of 59 , which started day three somewhat frenetically @entity0 congratulates a smiling @entity117 after his fellow opener reached his 50 milestone in the morning session yet as his innings progressed , he looked calmer and it was significant when he started walking off towards square leg between deliveries			1
he was in his little bubble again and it showed me that he was back			0
@entity117 has obviously been through a heck of a lot , has looked anxious and wants to prove the point that he belongs back with @entity12 and that he can open the batting in @entity136			1
the more he played , the more he looked like @entity117			2
@entity117 looked calmer as his innings went on but @entity137 found his edge before he could go on with it @entity117 leaves the field at @entity141 's - on @entity142 - after an opening partnership of 125 runs			1

@entity0 and @entity117 put on an opening partnership of 125
@entity0 scored an encouraging 76 before playing a wide ball onto his stumps
the @entity12 captain made the bowlers come to him and looked solid
@entity117 was first out for 59 but appeared *increasingly* *comfortable*
