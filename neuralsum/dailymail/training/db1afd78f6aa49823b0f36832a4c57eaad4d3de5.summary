two years ago @entity0 woke up from a coma more than a week after a horrific car crash that almost claimed his life only being able to speak @entity4			1
the 22 - year - old remembers how he woke up and saw a nurse who looked @entity9 standing by his bed and said to her ' excuse me nurse , i feel really sore here ' in @entity14			1
he then asked the nurse for a piece of paper and pen and he wrote on it in @entity4 : ' i love my mum , i love my dad , i will recover			2
@entity0 's father , @entity30 , and his mother were told it would be a miracle if their son survived			2
' we got the call from the hospital and [ the hospital staff member ] was saying " oh @entity30 , look i just wanted to ring and let you know that @entity0 's actually started to come out of the coma " ... and she said , “ i do n’t know how to say this ... he 's speaking @entity4 ' , " @entity30 told @entity42 's @entity43			1
' neither of us can speak @entity4 so we just nodded but deep down quite concerned about what ’s going on			2
' when he woke up , he was only able to speak fluent @entity4 - having only learned it at school the 22 - year - old along with his parents appeared on @entity42 's @entity43 to tell his story despite taking @entity4 at school , @entity0 had never been fluent at the language			1
' i was n’t consciously thinking i was speaking @entity4 , it was what just came out and it was what was most natural to me , ' he said			0
it took @entity0 two or three more days to recall how to speak @entity58			0
since then , @entity0 's language skills have open new opportunities to him like leading @entity14 tours of his hometown and hosting a @entity64 television program			0
now the @entity66 man has moved to @entity67 to study commerce at university			1
he said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language			0
but what happened to @entity0 is not the first of its kind			0
his parents said they were baffled that he could speak @entity4 as neither of them spoke the @entity14 language his new - found talent for the language led him to appear on a @entity4 television show and he now lives in @entity67 , studying commerce he said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language in 2010 , a 13 - year - old @entity83 girl woke up had replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking @entity86			1
more recently , a @entity88 navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room and had no recollection of who he was and spoke fluent @entity92 in july 2013			0
but a @entity94 neuroscientist thinks he might have an explanation about what happened to @entity0			0
dr @entity97 said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language , breathing , speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits			0
according to him , what possibly happened to @entity0 was that the parts of the brain that recalled @entity58 were damaged in the crash and those that retained @entity4 were activated when the 22 - year - old woke up from his coma .			1

@entity0 was the *passenger* of a car that was involved in a car crash
the 22 - year - old was in a coma for more than a week before he woke up
he had only learned @entity4 at school and was never fluent in it
the @entity66 is now studying commerce at a @entity67 university
