@entity0 has patented innovative technology to scare off fowl that gather in flocks near airports in an attempt to avoid costly and potentially devastating bird strikes			2
the proposed system would mimic bird noises and can be set up on the ground at an airport or its equipment can be fitted to front of an aircraft			2
it ’s the latest example of the lengths that manufacturers , airlines and airports are reaching as bird strikes cost the world ’s aviation industry nearly £ 1bn a year as a result of damage , delays for travellers or missed flight connections			1
the @entity26 says bird strikes cost the industry nearly £ 1bn a year patent : @entity0 has patented a system that mimics the sounds of birds in an attempt to prevent bird strikes nearly 2,500 bird strikes were reported in the @entity36 last year with an average of around six a day , according to the @entity38			1
a @entity40 study suggests there are an average of nine bird strikes a day involving civil aircraft in the @entity45 alone			1
to repel birds , @entity0 ’ system mimics warning signals from @entity50 , natural distress calls from specific flocks , and the flapping of wings			1
the ‘ acoustic scaring device ’ would be located on a plane ’s nose landing gear , according to a rough sketch submitted with the patent application			0
a study by a @entity61 consulting firm suggests each bird strike costs an average of £ 41,000 @entity0 patented the system as it expects a ‘ considerable increase ’ in the number of bird strikes due to a risk in air traffic in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , and that potentially means more delays for passengers			1
but the manufacturer admits it may not have found the perfect solution because some bird species may become accustomed to the noise or it may have no effect at all			0
last week , discount airline @entity81 announced that bird strikes had wreaked havoc on its operations			2
with four incidents in two weeks , the @entity86 - based airline had to delay or cancel flights because it had no replacement aircraft available			0
miracle on the @entity91 : there was no loss of life after a @entity96 flight ditched into @entity97 's @entity91 manufacturers , airlines and airports have been paying greater attention to the problem since arguably the most famous bird strike of all time			0
known as the @entity105 , a @entity96 @entity106 was forced to ditch into the @entity91 in @entity97 after hitting a flock of @entity109 geese on 29 january 2009			0
the incident was dubbed a ‘ miracle ’ because no one died			0
the largest loss of life resulting from a bird strike occurred in 1960 , when an @entity117 flight struck a flock of @entity120 starlings during take - off			2
a sign at @entity123 warns people not to feed birds as a crow is perched behind the security fence all four engines were damaged and the plane crashed in the @entity130 , @entity131 , harbour , killing 62 people			0
since 1912 , there have been nearly 250 fatalities arising from bird strikes , according to the @entity26			0
a study conducted by @entity61 consulting firm @entity138 found that bird strikes occur 2.1 times per 10,000 aircraft movements , and roughly two - thirds cause no damage			1
the remainder cost roughly £ 41,000 per strike , according to the study .			1

system would mimic noises of *predators* and natural distress calls
nearly 2,500 bird strikes were reported in the @entity36 last year
sixty - two people died in a crash after a plane hit a flock of birds in 1960
bird strikes cost roughly £ 41,000 per incident , study suggests
