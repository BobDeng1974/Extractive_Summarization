@entity0 is disappointed that @entity1 has disappeared from the shops without explanation as a consumer journalist , i 'm always on the hunt for cracking deals so that i can shave a few pounds off my shopping bill			1
but when it comes to skincare , cost considerations do n't apply			2
i 've bought countless expensive lotions and potions , hoping that just one will clear up my complexion			2
you see , i 'm one of millions in the @entity16 who have battled ' acne vulgaris ' , simply known as acne			2
this happens when sebaceous glands near the surface of the skin produce too much sebum , or oil , which mixes with dead skin cells			2
it blocks the hair follicles , tiny holes in the skin , forming blackheads and whiteheads			0
nasty pustules and cysts occur when those blocked follicles come into contact with otherwise harmless bacteria on the skin 's surface			0
the condition is believed to affect 80 per cent of those aged between 11 and 30 , according to the @entity40			0
and it can last into adulthood - i 'm 27 in march and still expect breakouts whenever life takes a stressful turn			2
i have been plagued by pimples since i was 14 but my condition reached ghastly new heights three years ago			0
when a painful breakout on the side of my neck triggered speculation from a colleague that i was overly fond of love bites , i resolved to find a cure for good			0
i tried anything and everything			0
there was high - tech heat therapy , supposed to kill acne - causing bacteria in the skin , as well as @entity63 seaweed ( known as thalassotherapy )			2
after spending a small fortune , i finally discovered the miracle - a blackhead - buster that was worth its weight in gold			1
and it cost £ 5			1
that miracle was @entity1 , an over-the - counter topical gel			1
its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide , widely considered the ' gold standard ' in acne treatment			0
it came to skin specialists ' attention in 1963 , when @entity83 dr @entity82 realised that the ingredient , used to treat infections of hair follicles , was also highly effective for acne			0
' it injects air into the pore , helping to remove bacteria , dirt and oil , and is anti-inflammatory , ' explains dr @entity95 of the @entity96 in @entity97			0
it does n't contain antibiotics , so resistance is n't a problem , adds dr @entity102 , a dermatologist at @entity103 in @entity104			0
' it 's simple , safe and effective			0
' for more than a year she used @entity1 every week until two years ago she was told it had been discontinued i started using the white cream an hour before bed each night			1
it had a strong antiseptic smell and made my skin tingle , but the next day i noticed a reduction in the size and redness of the spots on my neck and jawline , and within two weeks most were gone , with no scarring			0
for more than a year i used @entity1 every week - until two years ago i was told it had been discontinued			1
i found out through social media that the maker of @entity1 - a @entity123 - based @entity122 subsidiary called @entity124 - had halted production due to a ' global manufacturing supply issue '			1
it had been taken off the market , along with other @entity124 acne products			0
i was devastated , and so were others			0
@entity124 's @entity131 page has been flooded by complaining customers			0
one of them , @entity134 , a 32 - year - old charity worker from @entity135 who had been using @entity1 for two years , said his breakouts returned instantly when he stopped using it			1
' it 's a really important product			0
it would be like @entity141 being pulled from the painkiller market , ' he said			0
@entity124 representatives have told customers on @entity131 that the company is ' expediting a solution for [ @entity1 's ] production issues '			1
@entity122 would not tell @entity148 which ingredients were in short supply			1
@entity1 , an over-the - counter topical gel , cost £ 5 on @entity153 , benzoyl peroxide products are selling for as much as £ 299 for a small tube			1
but the @entity40 has urged patients to consult a ' qualified medical professional ' rather than buy @entity1 online			1
the problem is that effective alternatives to @entity1 are hard to come by			1
only two out of seven pharmacies i visited in @entity162 and @entity163 could recommend a product with benzoyl peroxide			0
@entity166 is the nearest equivalent - this contains both benzoyl peroxide and potassium hydroxyquinolone sulphate , which is antibacterial			2
but this , too , has been temporarily taken off shelves due to concerns about supply of @entity176 approved ingredients			1
as dr @entity178 , an @entity180 - based gp , says : ' this means there are no benzoyl peroxide products available over the counter			1
' the particular benefit of @entity1 is that it comes in two strengths of benzoyl peroxide , he adds			1
the 2.5 per cent formulation , which i used , was perfect for patients with ' milder ' acne			0
there are other benzoyl peroxide remedies such as @entity195 and @entity196 , but both require a prescription and contain other ingredients which can be problematic			2
the proportion of women over the age of 25 who develop acne @entity195 has 5 per cent benzoyl peroxide , which dr @entity178 says can cause dryness , as well as clindamycin phosphate , an antibiotic to which some people may be resistant			2
@entity196 has 2.5 per cent benzoyl peroxide			0
dr @entity95 also notes that both treatments are much more expensive than @entity1 , costing from around £ 14			1
@entity134 has tried both @entity195 and @entity196 ' but they made my skin very dry and did n't work '			0
so why , two years on , has @entity1 not returned to the shelves ? according to a @entity122 spokesman , @entity1 10 per cent @entity219 and @entity1 4 per cent @entity220 were ' returned to the market earlier this year ' - though , like me , others have had trouble obtaining these			1
the spokesman added ' due to strict @entity227 regulatory and quality requirements in addition to @entity122 standards , we were unable to restore other strength formulations at the time '			1
there are other options , such as the @entity235 or acne drug @entity236 , which reduces the action of the oil glands and bacteria that cause acne			0
but there have been concerns about side - effects - both drugs have been linked to depression and @entity236 to suicide			2
thankfully , my skin has cleared up of its own accord - i decided to stop using products , only splashing my face with water , though i occasionally resort to my last tube of @entity1			1
i still hope that miraculous @entity1 will soon be back on the shelves .			1

@entity1 , an over-the - counter topical gel at £ 5 , was a miracle for many
makers halted production due to a ' global manufacturing supply issue '
@entity122 would not tell @entity148 which ingredients were in short supply
