broadcasters are banned from paying for interviews but they routinely get around it by buying the rights to the interviewee ’s book instead			2
her editor will be @entity144 , whose other authors have included crime novelist @entity146 and journalist @entity147			0

after @entity172 was cleared last year of killing her two - year - old daughter , several publishers said they would not consider a book by her			1
‘ i think it ’s a huge gamble for somebody , ’ a publisher who had no intention of bidding on the story told the @entity181 earlier this month			0
‘ it ’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way			0
’ ' waiting to be heard ' will come out two months later than originally scheduled			0
the date was changed out of deference to a court in @entity5 that scheduled a march 25th hearing for the prosecution 's appeal of the former exchange student 's acquittal in the 2007 murder of her @entity9 roommate			2
@entity5 prosecutor @entity196 has said he is ‘ very convinced ’ that @entity22 and @entity19 were responsible for miss @entity21 's death in november 2007			2
but the @entity5 appeals court in october said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence			2
it added that the court had n't proven they were in the house when miss @entity21 was killed			0
tears in court : @entity1 after being acquitted last year a third defendant , @entity209 - born drifter @entity7 , was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing miss @entity21			1

in honour bound : my journey to @entity226 , the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25 - year - old blonde @entity161 , who he met just a week before tragic @entity7 was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house			2
he also describes the moment he met @entity19 again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009			0
dressed down : @entity1 and her boyfriend @entity245 wear casual clothes for their romantic stroll in @entity248 , @entity64 earlier this year @entity22 said : ' i was n't just nervous about setting eyes on her again			1
i felt i was suffering from some sort of associative disorder , in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for @entity1 without being overwhelmed by an instinctive , involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her			0
' two different @entity260 - the real one , and the distorted , she - devil version i had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind			0
' @entity19 and @entity22 were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of @entity7 's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed			0
comfortable : the pair reportedly share an apartment in @entity248 's @entity278 @entity19 performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on @entity22 's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie , the @entity161 promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had ' wild sex			0
' in his book @entity22 admits their behaviour was ' odd ' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated			0
he admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had ' each other ' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing			0
and in april , @entity305 , the father of @entity7 said that the media 's attention was all on @entity1 and not his daughter , the real victim ' the media ’s glare throughout the trial and appeal process has been fixed almost entirely on @entity1			1
books have been written about her and there has even been a television film focusing on her			0
it has seemed as if @entity7 has been all but forgotten			0
' since november last year , @entity19 has been dating @entity245 and the couple were reported to still be going strong together this fall .			0
