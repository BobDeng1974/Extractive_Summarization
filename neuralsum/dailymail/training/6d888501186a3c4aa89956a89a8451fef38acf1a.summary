by @entity0 last updated at 12:56 pm on 21st december 2011 hackers in @entity3 have managed to penetrate the computer networks of the @entity6 's top business - lobbying group , it has been claimed			1
all the data held by systems at the @entity6 @entity9 , including information about its 3million members , are said to have been left vulnerable after the infiltration			2
if true , the hack would be one of the boldest attacks yet in what has become an ongoing battle between @entity3 hackers and companies and agencies in the @entity6 hacked : networks at the @entity6 @entity9 were penetrated by hackers suspected to be working for the @entity3 government but the @entity3 embassy in @entity25 denied that their government was behind the attacks , dubbing the allegations ' irresponsible '			1
the security breach , which involved the infiltration of at least 300 internet addresses , was found last year and quietly shut down , the @entity29 reported			2
after a tip off from the @entity35 , computer security experts at the @entity9 shut it down by unplugging and destroying some computers			2
nevertheless , it is understood that hackers might have been able to access the network for more than a year before the hack was discovered			0
it 's not clear how much of the compromised data was actually viewed and losses from data theft is often difficult to assess			0
sources close to the @entity9 's investigation said that hackers had focused on four employees working on @entity49 policy , stealing six weeks ' worth of their email records			1
people close to the case told the @entity29 the emails revealed names of key firms and individuals in contact with the @entity9 , policy documents , meeting notes , trip reports and schedules			2
the @entity9 's chief operating officer , @entity63 , told the paper : ' what was unusual about it was that this was clearly somebody very sophisticated , who knew exactly who we are and who targeted specific people and used sophisticated tools to try to gather intelligence			0
' @entity73 , a spokesman for the @entity74 in @entity25 , denied the infiltration , insisting that hacking is banned under @entity3 law and should n't be ' politicised '			1
he told the @entity29 the allegation that the attack originated in @entity3 ' lacks proof and evidence and is irresponsible			1
' but the attack on the @entity9 's computer systems is just the latest hacking incident where the finger of suspicion has been pointed at @entity3			1
last month it emerged that @entity3 agents were suspected of seizing control of @entity6 government satellites on four occasions between 2007 and 2008			1
a @entity92 report into the attacks said that , while it could not prove for sure @entity3 was behind the them , what happened was ‘ consistent ’ with known @entity3 cyber war techniques			1
a @entity98 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more minutes of interference in october 2007 and july 2008			0
gaining control : a report to @entity92 reveals efforts to hack into two government satellites in 2007 and 2008 were traced to a station in @entity105 hackers also interfered with a @entity108 am - 1 earth observation satellite twice , for two minutes in june 2008 and nine minutes in october that year			0
during the final hack ‘ the responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite ’ , but did not do so , said the report by the @entity6 - @entity114			0
both satellites use the commercially operated @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity105 , that ‘ routinely relies on the internet for data access and file transfers , ’ the commission said , indicating this might have been how they were attacked			0
the satellites affected were run by @entity124 or the @entity125 and were mostly used for climate observation			0
but the @entity6 military and intelligence agencies also use them to communicate , collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance .			0
