a massive extension of @entity2 ’s landmark right - to - buy housing policy will be announced by @entity3 today			1
in a bold pitch to blue collar voters who delivered @entity2 ’s three election victories , the prime minister will call the @entity8 ‘ the party of working people ’			0
he will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent to allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home			1
mr @entity3 will borrow a phrase used by @entity2 in her first speech as party leader to declare the ‘ dream of a property - owning democracy is alive – and we will fulfil it ’			2
‘ the next @entity32 government will extend the right - to - buy to all housing association tenants in this country – 1.3million extra families – a new generation given the security of a home of their own , ’ he will say			1
mr @entity3 is also expected to promise to link the minimum wage to increases in the income tax allowance – meaning more than a million workers on £ 6.50 an hour will pay no tax at all			2
original plan : the right - to - buy scheme became @entity2 ’s most famous single policy launching his party ’s election manifesto , the prime minister will urge voters not to risk a change of government : ‘ let ’s not waste the past five years			1
‘ now is not a time to put it all at risk , but to build on the progress we have made			0
' we are the party of working people			0
so if you want a more secure @entity62 , if you want a brighter future for your family , and for you , then together , let ’s build on what we ’ve done – and see this through			0
’ the pledge to extend right - to - buy , which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by @entity70 in @entity71 and the @entity72 in @entity73 , will delight the @entity32 faithful , who were buoyed last night by a six - point poll lead over @entity70			1
senior figures , including @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party ’s manifesto			0
the original right - to - buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates			1
leading to a surge in home ownership , it became @entity2 ’s most famous single policy			2
the @entity92 government has already increased right - to - buy discounts for council homes , meaning more are moving into the private sector			1
but most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations – not - for - profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing – do not qualify			2
enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the @entity106 , and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves			2
as well as promoting home ownership , the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill			2
promises : the @entity113 , pictured posing for a selfie as he campaigned in @entity115 on monday , will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent on housing association properties , should the @entity8 win the election currently , taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties			1
the 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people			1
‘ at the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition			0
we are the party of working people , offering you security at every stage of your life , ’ mr @entity3 will say today			2
‘ if you ’re a young person looking for training , if you ’re looking for a decent job , if you want to buy your own home , if you ’re raising a family and need help with childcare , if you fall ill , and need to rely on our @entity138 , if you are reaching retirement , and want real security			2
we are there for you – offering security at every stage of your life			0
’ some @entity70 figures , including former welfare minister @entity146 and former cabinet minister @entity147 , have previously championed the idea of extending the right - to - buy to housing associations			1
@entity150 , of the @entity151 , which represents housing associations , said : ‘ extending right - to - buy to housing associations is the wrong solution to our housing crisis			1
while extending right - to - buy will see some people being able to buy their own home with help from the taxpayer , these are people already living in good secure homes on some of the country ’s cheapest rents			1
’ how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home			1
@entity70 dropped its opposition to the policy but , in 1999 , @entity172 ’s government cut the top discount from £ 50,000 to £ 38,000 and sales slowed			0
what has the coalition done ? it has sought to reinvigorate the scheme , cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £ 77,000 for most areas			1
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations – autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes – are largely exempt			1
however , around 800,000 ha tenants have a limited ‘ right to acquire ’ with discounts capped at between £ 9,000 to £ 16,000			0
the other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy			0
what are the @entity32 proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy			1
tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount , increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant			0
those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount , going up 2 per cent every year			0
discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £ 102,700 in @entity211 and £ 77,000 across the rest of @entity213			2
how will this be paid for ? the @entity8 say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant			0
council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off			0
around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year , because tenants die or move			0
the sell - off could net £ 4.5billion a year			0
what about the proceeds ? they will be split , with a proportion used to replace on a ‘ one - to - one ’ basis the council homes sold off			0
the new properties would be more affordable , probably in less expensive locations , and could be built either by a council or housing association			1
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants			1
the rest would go to create a £ 1billion fund , enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing			0
it would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land , and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years , @entity8 say .			0
