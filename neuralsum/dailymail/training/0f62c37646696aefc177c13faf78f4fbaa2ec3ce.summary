by @entity1 reporter published : 20:17 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 30 november 2012 @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 rebuked the @entity5 's vote to recognize a @entity7 state , calling it an ‘ unfortunate and counterproductive ’ move that further obstructs the path to a peaceful agreement between @entity11 and @entity12			1
‘ we have been clear that only through direct negotiations between the parties can the @entity7 and @entity12 achieve the peace they both deserve : two states for two people with a sovereign , viable independent @entity11 living @entity23 in peace and security with a @entity26 and democratic @entity12 , ’ @entity13 said on thursday in a speech in @entity15 on foreign policy trends			1
the @entity27 voted overwhelmingly thursday to recognize the @entity7 state , a long - sought victory for the @entity7 and an embarrassing diplomatic defeat for the @entity3			1
a @entity7 flag was quickly unfurled on the floor of the @entity5 , behind the @entity7 delegation			2
in the @entity53 city of @entity54 , hundreds crowded into the main square waved @entity7 flags and chanted ‘ @entity57 is great			0
’ others who had watched the vote on outdoor screens and television sets hugged , honked and set off fireworks before dancing in the streets			1
real independence , however , remains an elusive dream until the @entity7 negotiate a peace deal with the @entity12 , who warned that the @entity5 action will only delay a lasting solution			2
state secretary : @entity13 speaking at the @entity70 in @entity15 on thursday @entity12 still controls the @entity53 , east @entity71 and access to @entity73 , and it accused the @entity7 of bypassing negotiations with the campaign to upgrade their @entity27 status			1
the @entity7 still face enormous limitations			0
they do n't control their borders , airspace or trade , they have separate and competing governments in @entity73 and the @entity53 and they have no unified army or police			0
the @entity3 immediately criticized the historic vote			0
‘ today 's unfortunate and counterproductive resolution places further obstacles in the path peace , " ’ @entity27 ambassador @entity34 said			1
the @entity3 and @entity12 voted against recognition , joined by @entity89 , the @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
@entity11 's leader : @entity7 president @entity97 gathers his papers after speaking during a @entity100 meeting prior to the vote @entity12 prime minister @entity102 called the speech by @entity7 president @entity97 to the @entity5 shortly before the vote ‘ defamatory and venomous , ’ saying it was ‘ full of mendacious propaganda ’ against @entity12			1
@entity102 called the vote meaningless			0
@entity97 had told the @entity5 that it was ‘ being asked today to issue the birth certificate of @entity11			0
’ @entity97 said the vote is the last chance to save the two - state solution			2
after the vote , @entity102 said the @entity27 move violated past agreements between @entity12 and the @entity7 and that @entity12 would act accordingly , without elaborating what steps it might take			1
celebration : @entity7 gather next to a section of @entity12 separation barrier at the entrance to the @entity53 city of @entity121 to watch a large screen showing the @entity5 vote thursday 's vote came on the same day that the @entity5 in 1947 voted to recognize a partitioned state in @entity11 , with the jubilant revelers then @entity26			1
the @entity7 rejected that partition plan , and decades of tension and violence followed			0
just before thursday 's vote , @entity12 's @entity27 ambassador , @entity130 , warned the @entity5 that ' the @entity7 are turning their backs on peace ' and that the @entity27 ca n't break the 4,000 - year - old bond between the people of @entity12 and the land of @entity12			1
the vote had been certain to succeed , with most member states sympathetic to the @entity139 key countries , including @entity140 , this week announced they would support the move to elevate the @entity7 from the status of @entity27 observer to non-member observer state			1
@entity146 day : @entity7 celebrate as they watch a screen showing the @entity5 vote unlike the more powerful @entity150 , there are no vetoes in the @entity5 , and the resolution to raise the @entity7 status only required a majority vote for approval			2
the vote grants @entity97 an overwhelming international endorsement for his key position : establishment of a @entity7 state in the @entity53 , @entity73 and east @entity71 , the territories captured by @entity12 in the 1967 @entity163 war			1
with @entity102 opposed to a pullback to the 1967 lines , this should strengthen @entity97 ' hand if peace talks resume			0
the overwhelming vote also could help @entity97 restore some of his standing , which has been eroded by years of standstill in peace efforts			0
his rival , @entity174 , deeply entrenched in @entity73 , has seen its popularity rise after an @entity12 offensive on targets linked to the @entity179 militant group there earlier this month			0
@entity12 has stepped back from initial threats of harsh retaliation for the @entity7 seeking @entity27 recognition , but government officials warned that @entity12 would respond to any @entity7 attempts to use the upgraded status to confront @entity12 in international bodies			2
the @entity7 now can gain access to @entity27 agencies and international bodies , most significantly the @entity189 , which could become a springboard for going after @entity12 for alleged war crimes or its ongoing settlement building on war - won land			2
however , in the run - up to the @entity27 vote , @entity97 signaled that he wants recognition to give him leverage in future talks with @entity12 , and not as a tool for confronting or delegitimizing @entity12 , as @entity12 leaders have alleged			0
big day : @entity7 celebrate on a street in @entity202			0
