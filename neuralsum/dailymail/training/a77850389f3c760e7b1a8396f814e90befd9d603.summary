@entity1 ’s decision to change their team on the eve of the @entity4 showed to me where we still are with one - day cricket			1
would they have done the same to their test side the day before the @entity10 ? no , they would have been ready to go			0
maybe those switches will work as the @entity4 goes on			2
@entity13 might go on to be the answer for @entity1 at @entity15 in 50 - over cricket and @entity17 , as he showed in @entity18 , could thrive at six			1
it ’s just the timing of those changes that was odd and we still seemingly have a less settled approach to the one - day game , which reminds me of the bad old days when people were worried about being dropped every couple of matches			1
@entity13 hits a shot during @entity1 training , and he must be given a long - term chance at number three the timing of @entity33 's move into the pivotal three role shows how @entity1 have failed to prepare you could pretty much have named the @entity37 side for this @entity4 a year ago but could you have said that @entity1 ’s top three at the tournament would be @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity13 even a couple of months ago ? now that @entity1 have made those changes they had to stick with them for friday 's game in @entity46 and you have to say that , even though the timing was strange , @entity42 can not really feel hard done by			1
i felt @entity42 was unlucky to have been dropped when @entity1 played @entity51 last summer but maybe he came back with a little bit missing and was wondering when he would be left out again			1
he has n’t been scoring enough runs and his bowling is just not used often enough any more			0
@entity42 was unlucky to be dropped last summer , but he has n't done enough since then to earn his place @entity42 ( left ) practices a shot as @entity57 takes part in some training ahead of @entity1 's second game against @entity61 , @entity1 were too worried about strategy			1
there is a lot of time between games at @entity66 which means a lot of meetings and a lot of thinking and that can lead to over-thinking			0
clearly , with the long square boundaries at the @entity74 , @entity1 ’s plan was to bowl short but when it was not working they had to think on their feet			1
@entity1 players should have the ability to be instinctive			2
have plans , of course , but be prepared to change them			0
@entity1 ’s bowling is far too one - dimensional			1
if the ball is moving around they have a chance against any team in the world but if it ’s a flat , drop - in pitch they have n’t got a @entity89 @entity90 bowls during training , but @entity1 need to become less reliant on plans during their matches with plenty of time to think before games @entity1 can become too rigid when things are not going right no - one needs to be instinctive more so than @entity99			1
the captain is at his best when he just does what comes naturally but again there is evidence that he is thinking too much			0
for instance , @entity99 said the other day that he had to ‘ re-engage with the belief ’ he needs to have in his batting			2
that sounds like management - speak to me			0
can you imagine @entity110 saying that ? there is no question that @entity99 is pivotal to @entity1 doing well in @entity61 and @entity37			1
he has n’t just been out of form in his five innings before facing @entity37			0
the century in @entity117 was the exception to the rule of his largely poor form going back a year			2
@entity99 needs to get away from the ' management - speak ' and go back to his instinctive play the @entity1 captain has been out of form for the best part of a year , but is still crucial to the team 's success we have all been through it			1
we have all had a scrambled brain over where the next big innings is going to come from			0
you feel the pressure , particularly as captain , but @entity99 needs to deliver if @entity1 are going to prosper			2
the @entity4 so far has been pretty much what i was expecting			2
teams , on the whole , are batting first and racking up 300 plus			0
@entity61 are clearly the stand out side , they tick every box , so @entity1 will not be the only side thumped by them in this tournament			0
the associate countries are stronger than they used to be too			0
@entity147 beating @entity148 just was n’t a surprise			0
it did not constitute an upset			0
@entity61 are the best side in the @entity4 , and it wo n't only be @entity1 who suffer a heavy defeat to them @entity147 celebrate as the beaten @entity148 side trudge off the field in @entity157 after their defeat @entity160 , despite their defeat to @entity37 , showed plenty of steel , and are a well - prepared side the @entity165 team was full of established players whereas @entity148 were captained by a young lad in @entity168 with very little experience of the big stage			1
@entity160 , too , with @entity171 on the coaching staff , will be a well - prepared , committed outfit which is why @entity1 can not just expect to beat the associate teams in their group and progress that way			1
@entity1 have to get as far up their group as they can otherwise they will have a tough quarter - final back in @entity18 on a flat pitch and that means winning against the ‘ big ’ teams too			2
for them , the @entity4 starts now .			0

@entity41 , @entity40 and @entity13 *unthinkable* as a top three a year ago
late alterations show that one - day cricket is still not a priority
but now @entity1 have to keep a settled top order during the @entity4
@entity42 ca n't *complain* , he has n't done enough to win back his place
@entity1 ’s bowling is far too one - dimensional - they do n't have a @entity193
@entity99 needs to go back to instincts if @entity1 want to progress
associate nations have impressed and @entity1 may struggle to beat them
