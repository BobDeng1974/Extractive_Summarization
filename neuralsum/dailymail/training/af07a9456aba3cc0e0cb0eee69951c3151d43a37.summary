@entity0 came under attack yesterday over his promise to protect funding for schools after it emerged his plans would see spending per pupil fall in real terms			1
in a major speech on education billed as an ‘ all - out war on mediocrity ’ , the prime minister said every child should be able to attend a good school regardless of their postcode			2
but his pledge that the amount of funding per pupil would be ring - fenced in the next @entity21 started to unravel as he admitted spending would not increase in line with inflation			1
the prime minister said the amount of money per child in @entity28 schools would be protected in cash terms instead , the amount schools receive per pupil would be frozen at the current level and the schools budget would only see a small rise because of increasing numbers of schoolchildren			1
by the end of the next @entity21 , this would mean a cut in real terms of around 7 per cent to the schools budget for children aged between five and 16 , according to the @entity43			2
@entity44 , director of the @entity43 , said mr @entity0 ’s pledge represented ‘ quite a watering down ’ of the current arrangements , and ‘ real - term falls over the next @entity21 ’			1
speaking at a school in @entity49 , @entity50 , yesterday , mr @entity0 made his pledge not to cut the funding per child because good schools ‘ need money ’ , adding : ‘ a good education should n’t be a luxury – the preserve of those living within a certain postcode or those who can afford it			1
it should be something everyone in this country can get			0
’ @entity63 's shadow education secretary @entity62 said : ' the cat is out of the bag			1
the government will ensure real terms spending cuts for our schools ' but admitting afterwards that the amount of cash per pupil – around £ 4,200 a year for primary pupils , and £ 5,300 for those at secondary school – would be frozen , he said : ‘ i think that schools have demonstrated brilliantly over the last five years that they can be more efficient , they can be more effective , they can make their budgets work better			1
’ the @entity79 today released the ' @entity80 ' detailing what they claim were plans to cut money for schools when the coalition was formed			1
in a 13 - page dossier attacking @entity87 , @entity79 set out a point by point assessment of the @entity91 's time in government before he was appointed chief whip			1
tensions between mr @entity87 and his @entity79 colleagues erupted publicly on a number of occasions during his four years at the @entity98 , with prime minister @entity0 once forced to intervene in an ugly spat over funding			1
the document says @entity79 have spent much of the @entity21 engaged in a ' battle ' with mr @entity87 to damp down his ' ideological ' reforms			2
they claim the @entity91 have ' scorched earth plans ' that could mean funding for nurseries , schools and colleges is cut by a quarter within five years			2
education minister @entity110 insisted @entity79 stopped the @entity111 from reducing the schools budget in 2010			2
he said : ' the @entity91 assumption in 2010 was for a cash freeze in the schools budget - a whopping 10 % cut in real terms over the course of the @entity21			1
' a source close to mr @entity87 said : ' this document is as honest as @entity122 's policy on tuition fees			2
there 's nothing else to say about such a ludicrous document			0
' the @entity91 ’ decision not to cut funding for schools in the next @entity21 , just after they promised an extra £ 2billion a year for the @entity130 , will also raise concerns about which departments will face cuts , with fears that defence could be affected			1
@entity63 is expected to announce that it would increase schools funding in real terms if it wins office by cutting the deficit more slowly			1
however , it refused to spell out its plans yesterday			0
the party ’s education spokesman @entity62 said the @entity91 ’ claims to protect the schools budget were ‘ unravelling ’ , adding : ‘ you ca n’t protect schools when you have plans to take spending as a share of gdp back to levels not seen since the 1930s			0
’ the @entity79 say the @entity111 plan would mean funding for nurseries , sixth form colleges and the pupil premium – which funnels funds for disadvantaged children – may be slashed by £ 3billion by 2020			1
@entity79 schools spokesman @entity110 said yesterday : ‘ this is an unbelievably weak commitment from @entity0			1
‘ the conservatives have failed even to protect the schools budget in real terms , and it is clear that they will have to make deep cuts to early years and 16 to 19 education			2
this makes a mockery of the @entity91 ’ claims to want to raise standards			0
you simply ca n’t improve education while starving schools , nurseries and colleges of the resources they need			0
’ the funding row comes as the @entity91 announced tough new standards on literacy and numeracy in a drive to raise standards			0
mr @entity0 said the government ‘ wo n’t tolerate failure ’ and would raise achievement in 3,500 schools rated ‘ requires improvement ’ by the watchdog @entity186			1
he said every secondary school in this category would be expected to become an academy			0
@entity190 , leader of the @entity191 , attacked the proposals as ‘ ill informed ’ and a decision to ‘ declare war on schools ’			0
@entity0 at a @entity50 school yesterday when he was asked to calculate nine eights his party wants all children to know up to their 12 times table by the time they leave primary school			2
but @entity0 seemed wary of leading by example yesterday , when he was asked to calculate nine eights			0
the prime minister said : ‘ i do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school and i ’m going to stick to that in case i get it wrong			0
’ he told a journalist , who asked him the question after his speech on schools in @entity50 , that he was employing the ‘ @entity220 defence ’ – a reference to the answer given by his education secretary when she was asked on television what seven times eight is			0
mrs @entity227 told the @entity229 programme yesterday morning : ‘ i ’m not going to be answering any maths questions			0
’ the question is a classic minefield for politicians			0
last summer , @entity233 refused to answer the ‘ seven times eight ’ question when interviewed by children on live television			0
he told seven - year - old @entity237 from @entity238 that he made it ‘ a rule in life not to answer a load of maths questions ’ , but he added : ‘ of course there is a lot of maths in my job			0
’ in 1998 , @entity63 schools minister @entity248 was asked to multiply eight by seven and said ‘ 54 ’			2
the answer is 56 .			0

@entity251 said the amount of money per child will be protected in cash terms
but mr @entity0 admitted funding for schools will not go up with inflation
@entity63 said the cat was ' out of the bag ' - school spending will be cut
@entity79 release the ' @entity80 ' on @entity266 's cuts plan
