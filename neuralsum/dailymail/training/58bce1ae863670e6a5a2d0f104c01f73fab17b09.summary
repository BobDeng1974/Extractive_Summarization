by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 06:49 est , 18 october 2012 @entity1 lost a @entity3 battle today in its legal action over @entity7 ’s @entity6 tablet computer			1
the @entity9 electronics giant argued that the @entity10 was too similar to its own product			0
but a judge at the @entity13 in @entity14 ruled in july that the @entity6 tablet was not ' cool ' enough to be confused with @entity1 ’s @entity16 - a decision @entity1 challenged at the @entity3			1
@entity7 ' @entity19 tablet : a ruling claiming consumers were unlikely to confuse it with an @entity16 was upheld today			1
@entity1 has now lost a series of lawsuits against @entity7 based on the design of their tablets in the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity9 - despite sometimes winning temporary sales bans			1
however , the @entity32 - based company has been more successful with other claims			0
a @entity9 jury recently proposed @entity7 should pay @entity1 a $ 1.05bn ( £ 650m ) fine for infringing several software patents , and the look and feel of the @entity37 - although @entity7 is appealing the verdict			1
but the appeal was dismissed today by @entity40 , @entity41 and sir @entity42			0
they upheld the decision of judge @entity45 that three @entity6 tablet computers did not infringe @entity1 ’s registered design			1
judge @entity48 said earlier this year : ' they do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the @entity1 design			2
' they are not as cool			0
' he said consumers were not likely to get the two tablet computers mixed up			0
the judge said : ' the informed user ’s overall impression of each of the @entity6 tablets is the following : from the front they belong to the family which includes the @entity1 design ; but the @entity7 products are very thin , almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back			1
' the overall impression produced is different			0
' @entity1 had argued that the front face and overall shape were the most important factors because the informed user would spend the most time looking at the front and holding it			2
it is believed @entity1 must now go ahead with judge @entity48 ' original command to publish a notice on its own website for six months and take out adverts in various major magazines and newspapers proclaiming that @entity7 did not infringe its rights in today ’s ruling , sir @entity42 said : ' because this case ( and parallel cases in other countries ) has generated much publicity , it will avoid confusion to say what this case is about and not about			1
' it is not about whether @entity7 copied @entity1 ’s @entity16			1
' infringement of a registered design does not involve any question of whether there was copying : the issue is simply whether the accused design is too close to the registered design according to the tests laid down in the law			0
' he added : ' so this case is all about , and only about , @entity1 ’s registered design and the @entity7 products			2
' @entity1 ceo @entity108 is still involved in several legal battles around the world with @entity7			2
@entity7 said in a statement : ' we welcome the court ’s judgment , which reaffirmed our position that our @entity10 products do not infringe @entity1 ’s registered design right			1
' we continue to believe that @entity1 was not the first to design a tablet with a rectangular shape and rounded corners and that the origins of @entity1 ’s registered design features can be found in numerous examples of prior art. ' should @entity1 continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs , innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited			2
' the three @entity3 judges also rejected @entity1 ’s challenge against an order made by @entity48 that it must publicise the fact that it had lost the case			2
sir @entity42 said : ' the grant of such an order is not to punish the party concerned for its behaviour			0
nor is it to make it grovel - simply to lose face			0
' the test is whether there is a need to dispel commercial uncertainty			0
' ruling that an order was necessary , sir @entity42 said @entity1 must make the position clear ' that it acknowledges that the court has decided that these @entity7 products do not infringe its registered design			1
' the acknowledgment must come from the horse ’s mouth			0
' nothing short of that will be sure to do the job completely			0

ruling upholds july decision that consumers will not confuse the two tablets
@entity1 must now run notice on its own website for six months and take out adverts in various major magazines and newspapers saying @entity7 did not infringe its rights
