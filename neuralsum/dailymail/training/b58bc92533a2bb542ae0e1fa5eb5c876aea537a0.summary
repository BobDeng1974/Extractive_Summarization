by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor environment secretary @entity2 today refused to back @entity4 's claim that the devastating storms which have battered @entity6 are linked to climate change			1
the @entity9 minister , who is widely viewed as a climate change sceptic , seemed unable to bring himself to endorse the prime minister 's view that global warming was to blame for the 60mph winds , heavy rain and floods which have swept across most of the country			1
it came as the @entity19 insisted it was too early to say what was the cause of the terrible weather , amid warnings that @entity6 must be braced for sub-zero temperatures and snow this weekend			1
environment secretary @entity2 declined to repeat @entity4 's claim that the floods have been caused by climate change the @entity27 has issued more than 300 flood warnings or alerts for @entity30 and @entity31 , with the majority in the @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity31 and @entity35 are to endure more rain today and tomorrow , which will return again on sunday - with a high chance of snow in the @entity39			2
rising rivers include the @entity41 through @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , the @entity45 in @entity46 and the @entity47 through the @entity33			0
yesterday mr @entity4 told @entity48 : ' we are seeing more abnormal weather events			2
‘ colleagues across the @entity52 can argue about whether that is linked to climate change or not			2
i very much suspect that it is			0
' today @entity57 mp @entity56 asked mr @entity2 if he agreed with the pm 's view that the recent spell of severe weather was man made , prompting a roar of laughter on the opposition benches			2
mr @entity2 side - stepped the question , replying : ' what the prime minister said is we should look at the practical measures we 're taking , and i entirely endorse his questions			1
' meanwhile , the @entity19 insisted it is too early to say whether climate change is behind the storms that have wreaked havoc across @entity6			1
watch out : the @entity27 has issued more than 300 flood warnings or alerts for @entity30 and @entity31 , with the majority in the @entity33 and @entity34 wet : the rain will continue this weekend , as river levels continue to rise in counties including @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity46 and the @entity33 meteorologists said that no scientific research had been carried out into the cause of the heavy rain and floods that has blighted much of the country over @entity89 and the @entity90			1
@entity91 , a @entity19 spokesman , said : ' no attribution study has been done , so you ca n't make a definitive statement about how more or less likely the recent flooding has become because of climate change			1
' mr @entity91 said the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) - the world leader on research into climate change - had produced a report last year linking some types of ' extreme weather ' with man - made climate change			1
' so if you are talking about extreme weather globally there has been some observed increase in some types of extreme weather and there is some evidence , depending on which types of extreme weather you are talking about , of a link between man - made climate change and some types of extreme weather , ' he said			1
crumpled : @entity122 's wrecked @entity121 in the sea off the @entity125 coast at @entity126 response team : an underpass near @entity130 subway station in @entity131 , @entity132 , being pumped out by emergency services after a water mains failed mr @entity91 said that this research was supported by attribution studies which looked at specific weather - related events , such as @entity138 , which devastated the @entity140 and @entity141 , or a drought in @entity143			0
' they can see how that event is more or less likely because of human influence , ' he said			0
' what those attribution studies have shown is that some events have become more likely and there are some events where there is no evidence of any human influence at all - it 's a mixed bag really			0
' you ca n't say definitively that an event is caused by climate change and climate change only because we have always had extreme weather			1
' but the chances of extreme weather occurring may have altered because of climate change			1
' so it would be consistent with the picture we have seen of increasing rainfall in the @entity6 over the past few decades			2
' communities along the @entity169 throughout @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 have also been warned they are at risk of flooding in the coming days			0
fresh fall : a snow plough clears the @entity176 in @entity177 , following overnight snow			0
more snow is expected for parts of the @entity39 this weekend flooding continues on parts of the @entity183 , and there remains a risk of flooding from groundwater in @entity44 , @entity42 and @entity188			0
and this weekend conditions could worsen when temperatures plummet and snow arrives			2
@entity192 of @entity193 said : ‘ there will be rain across a lot of @entity30 and @entity31 today and also showers in @entity132 and @entity197			0
' it will all begin to clear throughout tomorrow before dry and sunny weather arrives at the weekend			0
‘ with that though we will have colder temperatures , dropping to below freezing on saturday evening			0
' ( we will also have ) snow across the hills in north @entity35 and reaching the ground in @entity132			0
but come sunday , the rain will return in the south			0
