by @entity0 the governor of @entity2 wants to open @entity3 for longer hours in a bid to attract an extra 5,000 tourists a day to the @entity7 site			1
@entity8 has suggested keeping the ruins open until 8pm daily in a bid to double the number of people who can visit the hilltop site			2
the current opening hours are from 6am to 5pm and conservationists have already warned that the ruins are put under undue strain by the quantity of visitors , but mr @entity8 feels the extra three hours will help meet the huge demand from tourists			1
spectacular : the @entity7 ruins are a popular destination for travellers wanting to tick the site off their bucket list the ruins , which were named one of the @entity29 in 2007 , currently undergo maintenance every day in a bid to prevent long - term damage by visitors			1
but there are fears extra visitors could further damage the terraces , although it would also be a money - spinner for the nation			1
currently there is a limit of 2,500 people allowed at the site daily , but the extra three hours could see that number soar to as many as 5,000			1
regional director of tourism @entity46 has led the call against extended opening hours			2
he said : ' we must protect @entity3 and not just see the site as a goldmine			0
' a total of 1.17 million tourists visited @entity3 in 2013 , of which 804,000 were foreign visitors , and some have campaigned against the increasing number of tourists visiting the hilltop citadel			2
in 2012 the @entity60 was advised to consider adding @entity3 to the list of world heritage sites in danger			0
the stone terraces : maintenance is carried out to protect the site but there is concern extra visitors will cause more damage a report at the time said that the 2,500 visitor limit had been exceeded on ‘ numerous occasions ’ and added that ‘ the intention to increase the number of visitors to the property would further exacerbate existing problems			1
’ on the @entity82 website , a statement reads : ' tourism itself represents a double - edged sword by providing economic benefits but also by resulting in major cultural and ecological impacts			0
' the strongly increasing number of visitors to the @entity90 of @entity3 must be matched by an adequate management regulating access , diversifying the offer and efforts to fully understand and minimize impacts			0
' there are similar concerns over a new international airport close to the site in @entity2 which got the go ahead earlier this year			0
llama tour : the animals roam wild at @entity3 but they might not appreciate extra guests breathtaking views : @entity3 is at the top of many peoples ' wish list of places to visit once the international airport is opened it will allow tourists to fly direct to the site , rather than arriving in @entity109 and taking an internal flight			2
the current airport in @entity2 has a limit of two million tourists a year whereas the new hub will be able to welcome five million , and eventually up to eight million			0
locals are divided between those who fear their traditions are being eroded by the influx of foreign visitors and others who know the development is a boon for tourism .			0
