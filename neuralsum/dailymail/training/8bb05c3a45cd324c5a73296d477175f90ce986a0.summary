thousands of patients are dying in hospital each year because of bad handwriting , errors in maths and poor monitoring by nursing , according to a study			2
the death rate at two hospitals fell by 15 per cent after nurses were given electronic devices in place of handwritten paper notes to record patients ’ heart rates and breathing			1
researchers calculated that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at the two hospitals , @entity20 @entity19 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23			1
at present , nurses are meant to measure patients ’ heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed : there is no suggestion that these nurses have illegible handwriting ( file photo ) across the @entity39 , this means 37,000 deaths could be avoided if nurses were given the devices rather than relying on traditional handwritten notes from nurses			1

often these readings are n’t taken regularly enough and in some patients there are gaps of between eight and 12 hours between measures			2
in other cases , nurses handwriting is illegible or they do n’t note down all the figures meaning it is not clear for their colleagues to monitor patients			2
to address the problem of poor handwriting , hand - held devices were given to nurses at @entity67 in @entity21 ( above ) to address the problem , hand - held devices were given to nurses at @entity67 in @entity21 in 2005 and at @entity70 in @entity23 in 2007			1
they were handed either iphones or @entity73 – small computers – installed with an app that takes patients readings and reminds nurses when they are next needed			1
an alert flashes up on the screen if patients are deteriorating and in some cases they will urge nurses to summon a doctor			0
researchers compared the death rates for every year from 2004 – before the devices were used – to 2010			0
they annual death rates fell by 397 at @entity21 and by 372 deaths at @entity23 in 2010 compared to 2004			1
dr @entity90 of @entity91 , one of the leaders of the project , said : ‘ observing patients and making accurate records provides a safety net to guard against their deterioration			0
‘ we believed traditional paper charts were not doing the job well enough so we designed an electronic system to support staff			0
this study shows its introduction was followed by a significant drop in deaths			0
” dr @entity108 of @entity22 , who also worked on the project , said : ‘ this technology improves the performance of routine but important tasks and frees up clinical staff to do what only human beings can do – care for patients			0
” many of the deaths avoided would have occurred in the elderly who had developed pneumonia or infections which would otherwise have been spotted too late			0
typically they cost around £ 500,000 to roll out across a medium - sized hospital trust and about 40 are now using them in at leat one department .			0
