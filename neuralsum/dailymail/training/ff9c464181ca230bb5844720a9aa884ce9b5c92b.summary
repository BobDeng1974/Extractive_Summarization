tragic : @entity1 , called @entity4 , was injured in a botched @entity6 raid on a relatives home earlier this year the parents of a toddler who was left disfigured after being hit with a stun - gun grenade in a botched drug raid while he slept in his crib are speaking out after a grand jury decided not to bring up charges in the heartbreaking case			1
@entity16 and @entity18 's youngest son @entity0 , called ' @entity19 ' , was just 18 - months - old when a swat team burst through his bedroom and threw a flash - bang device at his sleeper crib , in the hunt to find a drug - dealing cousin who did n't even live there			1
now , after several surgeries to address the boy 's serious injuries , the family is left with over $ 1million in medical bills that the county has refused to pay			1
' before this we did nâ€™t owe anybody anything , ' mrs @entity33 recently told @entity38			0
' and now after all this , they have completely financially crippled us			0
' and that was n't the only tragedy the family experienced last year			2
the @entity44 and their four children were only in @entity46 because their house in @entity49 , @entity47 burned down that spring , leaving them homeless			1
they moved in with @entity1 's sister in @entity51 , @entity46 while looking for a new home back in @entity47 , all crammed into the garage , converted into a bedroom			1
they had just found a new home and were planning to move back to @entity47 when the @entity6 raid happened in the early hours of may 28			1
the swat team was looking for mr @entity18 's 30 - year - old nephew @entity60 , who an informant said was selling methamphetamine from his mother 's house where the family was staying			1
drug agent @entity66 secured the ' no - knock ' warrant , which allowed her team to search the house without notifying the owners			2
heartbreaking : in october , a grand jury decided not to bring up criminal charges related to the raid , which left @entity4 with burns to his face and chest and a collapsed lung ( pictured before the raid on the left , and after on the right ) scarred : @entity4 spend five weeks in a medically - induced coma and continues to recover from his injuries			1
his parents say they now owe more than $ 1million in medical bills , which the county has refused to pay damage : a swat team was carrying out a ' no - knock ' warrant to arrest @entity4 's drug - dealer cousin the night of the accident wrong house : but his parents say they did n't see 30 - year - old @entity60 at the house the entire time they were staying there police reports show that it was @entity98 deputy @entity97 who threw the ' flash - bang ' grenade that landed in @entity4 's pack - and - play			1
innocent : @entity103 pictured in happier and healthier times mrs @entity33 says she immediately heard her baby start screaming , and she went to grab him but was stopped by police , with deputy @entity107 stepping in to pick up the child			0
' i kept telling him , " just give me my son			0
" the officer would n't			0
and then he walked out of the room with [ @entity4 ] and i did n't see him again			0
' she says they would n't even let her see her child before taking him away in an ambulance , and only said at the time that he was fine and just lost a tooth			0
but mr @entity18 got a clue about the real extent of his son 's injuries when he noticed a pool of blood by the baby 's crib			1
the couple were held by police for two hours , and when they showed up at the hospital , they found @entity4 in a serious condition with burns on his face and torso and a collapsed lung			1
@entity4 was in such poor condition that doctors at @entity139 's @entity138 put him into a medically - induced coma for five weeks			2
meanwhile , police arrested @entity60 a few hours later without incident			0
he pleaded guilty to selling meth and is currently serving a 10 - year sentence in @entity46 prison			1
mrs @entity33 still does n't know why drug agents thought @entity60 was at the home			2
she says while her sister - in - law feared her son had stolen things from the house , they never saw him the entire time they were living there			2
' they messed up , ' mrs @entity33 said			0
' they had a faulty search warrant			0
they raided the wrong house			0
' while her son was still healing in the hospital , both agent @entity163 and the judge who signed the warrant resigned from their positions , and later the task force that organized the raid was disbanded			0
however , the family is now left reeling by the fact that a grand jury investigating the raid decided not to bring up criminal charges in the case , though they admitted the work was ' sloppy '			1
and the family has n't received any compensation from the county since a @entity46 state ' gratuity ' law protects local governments from having to pay			2
the family still has the option to file a civil suit however , and there is also an ongoing federal investigation			0
the @entity187 's have three other children including 7 - year - old @entity189 , 5 - year - old @entity190 and 3 - year - old @entity191			1
they have set up a webpage to bring justice for their baby , which can be reached below			0
all together : the couple have three other children together including 7 - year - old daughter @entity189 , 5 - year - old daughter @entity190 and 3 - year - old daughter @entity191			2
