by @entity0 it came from the depths of the ocean			0
a strange , billowing deep - sea creature that unexpectedly floated into view on an oil rig camera			2
the mysterious sea creature was spotted 5,000ft deep in the @entity8 two years ago , but it has only just been identified by marine biologists			1
a quick glimpse of a hexagonal pattern on its billowing skin helped a team of scientists figure out that the strange creature was a huge jellyfish			1
after it glided into view of the rig , the camera operator moved the focus from the rig structure to the murky depths to try to get a closer look			0
at first the jellyfish disappeared into the darkness of the deep sea , but it soon floated back into view			1
it is more usually found in the cooler waters of the @entity40 that the @entity8 , which led many people to first suggest that the strangely shaped object could actually be a whale placenta			2
when the footage was first released it led to widespread speculation on the internet as web users tried to determine what they were seeing			0
a marine biologists from @entity51 finally confirmed that it was the placental jellyfish			0
the species is seen so rarely alive and intact that scientists had to use old dive notes from the 1960s and 1980s to help identify it , @entity53 reported			0
markers : its hexagonal pattern helped marine biologists to identify it as a placental jellyfish unusual : the jellyfish is rarely seen alive or intact , which made its sighting interesting to the science community deep sea mystery : the jellyfish had only a few identifying markers to help marine biologists name it unexpected : the jellyfish can grow to 2ft wide and is more commonly found in the @entity40			1

deep sea species was seen gliding through the @entity8
@entity78 pattern on membrane - like skin helped finally identify it
