it is a sign of how far @entity1 have come that leaving @entity2 with an eight - point defeat is disappointing			1
but i ca n’t help feeling this was a missed opportunity for them to get , at least , a losing bonus point			0
there were a few things outwith their own control but , ultimately , it came down to their own ill discipline which cost them a chance of winning			0
it is tough enough playing at @entity2 with a full complement of players on the pitch but to play them for a full 20 minutes when down to 14 men is near impossible			1
@entity2 full back @entity21 crashes over for a crucial try at @entity23 there are good penalties and there are bad penalties in rugby			1
the good ones are when you are under severe pressure on your own line and giving away three points is much better than the seven that would occur if you let them recycle possession			0
both the penalties that resulted in yellow cards were nothing like this			0
the first was a stupid tip tackle from @entity43 when he took his opposite number above the horizontal and drove him into the ground			1
the fact that it was his back that he landed on and not his neck meant it was a yellow rather than a red card but @entity52 conceded 13 points during the period of being down a man			2
the other sin - binning was even dumber as @entity57 knocked the ball out of the scrum - half ’s hand when he was lying on the ground and the @entity63 defence was looking very strong			1
they only conceded three points during this period but it took a lot of energy for that to happen , which meant they had too much to do at the end of the match			0
@entity2 scrum half @entity73 kicked 14 points from the tee as the @entity78 side triumphed over @entity52 discipline is key and even more important when you go down to 14 men but @entity52 coughed up easy ball on two occasions to give @entity2 possession , one which resulted in the only try of the game for the @entity78 just at the start of the second half			1
@entity52 showed real guts to emerge with a try of their own at the end from sub @entity94			2
i am sure i was not alone in screaming at the tv for him to sprint as fast as he could to make the kick as easy as possible			0
but he jogged over the line , which meant that @entity101 had a tougher kick to earn the @entity1 a losing bonus point — and he subsequently missed			0
it was a moment that could come back to haunt the @entity105 as all points in this group are going to be vital			2
@entity52 flanker @entity108 ( left ) tries to halt the progress of @entity2 centre @entity110 there was a contentious decision at the end of the first half that ultimately cost @entity52 , as well			1
referee @entity116 allowed @entity2 to take a quick line - out when @entity118 was lying close by on the ground with a head injury			2
this play ended up with the @entity78 converting a penalty , which was the main cause at the end of @entity52 missing out on a losing bonus point			0
there were many good performances from the likes of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity108 but @entity52 were not able to convert pressure into points in the first 20 minutes when they dominated possession and territory			2
all is not lost because the return match comes only in six days ’ time and @entity52 have another chance to turn the tables on @entity2			1
@entity2 lock @entity139 ( right ) is rocked by strong tackle but managers to get an offload away what is key is to win the game without @entity2 gaining the bonus point that eluded @entity52 yesterday			1
qualification to the quarter - finals is still in their own hands but only if they win at @entity150 next saturday			1
there is nothing to fear from @entity2			0
they showed glimpses of potential yesterday but @entity52 can cope with them			0
keeping all of their players on the pitch for the full 80 minutes is a must , though .			0
