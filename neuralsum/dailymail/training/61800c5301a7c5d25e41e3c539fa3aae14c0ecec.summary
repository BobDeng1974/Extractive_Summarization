@entity1 bid for @entity2 ruled out @entity3 now frontrunners for anchor tenancy mayor confirms stadium unlikely to be ready until 2016 @entity8 chairman labels process a farce @entity3 have received a boost in their bid to move into the @entity2 after the @entity1 's proposal to become anchor tenants was thrown out			1
the @entity15 gridiron franchise were willing to share the stadium with other sports and events but were told that they could not have the exclusive access to the venue each year from september to january which they felt they required to prepare and host consecutive games			0
in a further twist , mayor @entity25 - the chairman of the @entity26 who operate the stadium - confirmed rumours that the stadium will not be re-opened until 2016 to be true			1
up in the air : the future of the @entity2 remains unclear the mayor said on wednesday that it was ' highly unlikely ' that the stadium would be converted and ready for use again before the 2016 @entity36 in rio - meaning , incredibly , that it will take longer to convert the stadium than it did to build it			1
the delay in re-opening of the stadium has been branded ' a farce ' by @entity8 chairman @entity43			1
@entity43 said : ' my biggest concern is that we have some major events planned for that stadium and we thought they were going to be from the summer of 2014 onwards			0
' all of the legacy use was scheduled to start in two years ' time and now it might be four years ' time which strikes me as ludicrous and to be a paralysis of decision - making which i hope the mayor [ @entity25 ] is going to cut through			0
close call : @entity56 is in the same borough as the @entity2 but the @entity1 franchises are more than a short hop away ' i would n't say this is a @entity61 farce but this is fast becoming a @entity64 farce			1
' we want to lock into the legacy of the @entity36 while people still remember the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
' let 's have a bit of imagination here and let 's have a decision - we want one , @entity3 want one and we all want it open as soon as possible			2
' @entity25 had opened talks with the @entity1 last month when four of their teams were in @entity83 playing regular - season games at @entity85			2
the @entity87 's refusal to hand over the £ 337 million @entity2 - contingency underspend to help install retractable seating is hampering @entity3 's bid			1
the retractable seating is expected to cost in the region of £ 200 million and the mayor will be expecting any anchor tenant to make a significant contribution			2
@entity25 takes to the microphone with opera singer @entity96 at @entity85 before meeting @entity97 and @entity98 it is understood @entity3 are willing to offer more than £ 8million a year in rent and related payments in addition to a reported multimillion lump sum			0
the club are unable to reveal the true nature of their financial package due to confidentiality issues			0
@entity3 also believe that as several other events will be taking place at the @entity2 throughout the next few years - such as the 2017 @entity110 - they should not be the sole party asked to foot the bill			1
a decision on the future of the stadium was expected to be announced by the end of october but negotiations are ongoing			0
other contenders for the stadium tenancy are @entity120 , a football business college and a group wanting to host a @entity123 race at the @entity124 .			0
