i would n't have missed a drug test like @entity2 how i headbutted @entity3 and gave him a black eye i do n't regret the tackle on @entity7 he did n't even own the bloody thing - @entity9 on the @entity12 dispute i knew @entity13 would rule the world @entity9 has revealed he launched an expletive - laden rant at sir @entity16 which ultimately led to his departure from @entity19			1
@entity9 spectacularly fell out with @entity16 following the then captain 's harsh words during an interview with @entity23 - which earned the @entity25 a £ 5,000 fine from the club			1
but worse was to come after a training - ground bust - up involving @entity9 , assistant boss @entity28 , goalkeeper @entity29 and @entity16			1
@entity9 had an explosive bust - up with sir @entity16 in the aftermath of an interview with @entity23 @entity9 reveals in his book , @entity34 , extracts of which have been published in the @entity36 , that @entity28 accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team - mates after his @entity23 interview in which he tore into a number of the then @entity44 stars			1
@entity16 stepped in to quell the row , saying : ' that ’s enough			1
i ’ve had enough of all this stuff			1
' @entity9 responded by saying : ' you as well gaffer			1
we need f * * * * * * more from you			1
we need a bit more , gaffer			2
we 're slipping behind other teams			2
' when @entity29 chipped in and suggested @entity9 could have used a ' different tone ' the reply was robust			1
' @entity29 , why do n’t you shut the f * * * up ? you ’ve been at this club for two minutes and you ’ve done more interviews than i ’ve done in my 12 years			1
it was @entity23 – i had to do it			1
' ' once we were at @entity66 – they were playing @entity67			2
we were standing at the corner flag and @entity69 ( @entity70 ) was next to me			2
he goes : " this is great is n’t it ? "			2
i went : " i used to play in these games @entity69 "			2
i was n’t being cocky			2
' it ’s about justification , what you stand for			2
when i was at @entity44 i was getting paid good money but i could go : " yeah , but i 'm giving it back to you "			1
i did n’t feel that way with this tv work			2
it ’s an easy gig			2
i do n’t like easy gigs			2
when i heard : " i liked your commentary last night "			2
i knew i was only talking bulls * * * like the rest of them			2
hopefully my bulls * * * was a bit better			2
i wanted to do something that excited me			2
tv work did n’t excite me			0
' i liked @entity69 and @entity94 , though			0
what i really enjoyed was the company			0
i liked meeting people , old players like @entity99 ’s @entity98			0
some @entity44 fans saw us together and one of them said : “ why the f * * * are you talking to him ? ”			0
i felt like saying : “ i will speak to who i f * * * ing want to ! " ' @entity16 spoke about the @entity23 interview in his book - released last year - and @entity9 has answered back @entity16 and @entity9 's row eventually led to the end of the @entity25 's @entity44 career @entity9 was @entity44 manager @entity16 's leader on the pitch during his glory - filled years at @entity19 @entity9 later met @entity16 to discuss why he had been left out of a reserves match , which had been pencilled in to help his recovery from a broken foot , but was shocked at how the meeting unfolded			1
@entity16 said : ' @entity9 , i think we ’ve come to the end , ' and @entity9 agreed , then chief executive @entity121 presented a written statement on the @entity25 's departure			1
@entity9 said : ' they had it all ready			1
it was another little hand grenade they threw at me			0
not an hour later , or two hours , or after the severance negotiations – it was already written			0
‘ i said to @entity16 , “ can i play for somebody else ? ” and he said , “ yeah you can , cos we ’re tearing up your contract “			1
' so i thought , “ all right – i ’ll get fixed up ”			0
i knew there ’d be clubs in for me when the news got out			0
' i said , “ yeah - i think we have come to the end ”			1
‘ i just thought , “ f * * * * * * ’ p * * * * ” – and i stood up and went “ yeah			0
' i wonder about the current @entity44 dressing room			0
when a manager like sir @entity16 is replaced the new man needs a helping hand			1
does that mean every player should like him ? no. ' but i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			0
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
' looking at what happened to @entity154 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
' @entity158 and @entity9 had words when the @entity160 chipped in during the row with @entity16 sir @entity16 could only look on as his @entity44 side were ripped apart by @entity164 @entity9 is now assistant manager at @entity165 , working under former @entity167 midfielder @entity166 @entity28 , @entity16 's assistant at the time , was involved in the row with @entity9 @entity9 also revealed his exit cost him £ 1million – a bonus written into his contract if he played in 50 per cent of @entity44 ’s matches that season			1
but he does regret apologising to @entity16 and @entity28 after the bust - up			1
‘ now i kind of wish i had n’t			0
afterwards i was thinking , “ i ’m not sure why i f * * * * * * apologised ”			0
' i just wanted to do the right thing			0
i was apologising for what had happened – that it had happened			0
‘ but i was n’t apologising for my behaviour or stance			0
there is a difference – i had nothing to apologise for			1
’ in his own book , released last year , @entity16 said his former captain had ' overstepped the mark ' and when questioned at the time , @entity9 said he would deal with the ' lies ' on another occasion			1
i worked under two great managers and i put @entity190 ahead of @entity16 for a simple reason			1
what was the most important thing in my football career ? @entity190 signing me			0
different managers , both brilliant			0
i think @entity190 ’s warmth was genuine			0
i think with sir @entity16 it was pure business – everything is business			1
if he was being nice i would think : ‘ this is business , this ’			0
@entity190 ( left ) , pictured at the 1992 @entity205 final , is the boss @entity9 rates his no 1 he was driven and ruthless			1
that lack of warmth was his strength			0
@entity44 was a much bigger club than @entity210 but his coldness made him successful			0
his message was the same			0
i was never once confused by one of his team talks or his tactics or his training			1
the message was always fresh			0
i must have heard him talk 500 times and i always thought : ‘ yeah , that was good ’			0
i think that ’s amazing			0
as a manager i would take @entity190 ’s warmth and @entity16 ’s ruthlessness and put them in the mix – but also add my own traits			1
