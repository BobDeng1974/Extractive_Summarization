when @entity1 and @entity2 waved goodbye to their children at a @entity7 park just before @entity8 last year , they thought nothing of letting the youngsters walk a mile home on their own			1
after all , @entity12 , 10 , and @entity13 , six , had been on three trips together already , walking up to three quarters of a mile from their parents ' house in @entity19			0
@entity20 and @entity2 , who describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' , encouraged them to take the journeys to learn responsibility , build confidence , and teach them about the outside world			1
but on this occasion the kids made it halfway home before the cops arrived			2
they took the infants home , @entity35 were called , and @entity20 and @entity2 were accused of neglect			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) says she and husband @entity1 often let their children @entity12 , ten , and @entity13 , six , walk alone to teach them about the world - but they have now been accused of neglect @entity1 was asked to sign a form saying he would n't let the children go out unsupervised and initially refused , but was told that @entity12 and @entity13 could be taken away otherwise , so he gave in			1
workers from @entity45 ( @entity35 ) even went to their children 's school and questioned the youngsters without their parents ' knowledge			2
@entity20 and @entity2 have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them , but say whatever happens next , the experience has left them furious			2
@entity2 told the @entity56 : ' i think what @entity35 considered neglect , we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing			1
free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			1
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			1
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
' we feel we ’re being bullied into a point of view about child - rearing that we strongly disagree with			0
' the @entity95 are advocates of ' free range parenting ' , a school of thought set up in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parents ' , who micro-manage every element of their children 's lives in an attempt to keep them safe			1
@entity2 insists that while their hands - off approach may panic some people , in fact she is just trying to give her children the same ' old - fashioned ' upbringing she had			1
she told @entity111 : ' i grew up in @entity113 in the ' 70s and nobody hesitated to let their kids walk around			2
' the world is actually even safer than when i was a child			0
the only thing that 's changed between then and now is our fear			0
' i think it ’s absolutely critical for their development — to learn responsibility , to experience the world , to gain confidence and competency			0
' she describes parenthood as being ' an exercise in risk management ' and say her and her husband spend the same amount of time as any parent worrying about what is and is n't safe			0
the only difference is where they decide to draw the line			0
she said parents should stop worrying that their children are going to be abducted , saying such disappearances are ' incredibly rare ' , and should instead focus on more likely problems , such as road safety			2
@entity2 and @entity20 waved goodbye to their children at this park in @entity19 on december 20			1
the next time they saw them they were in the back of a police car after cops picked them up she often lets the children go for walks together , around the block , or up to the local 7/11			2
they even carry a card which reads : ' i 'm not lost , i 'm a free range kid			1
' however , when police stopped the children on december 20 as they were walking back home from @entity165 , they did n't have the card on them			1
the children told officers that they were n't doing anything wrong by walking home , but were still put into a patrol car and driven back to their house			1
@entity1 said he was given a ' tense ' lecture by officers on the dangers of the world			0
but the real problem began after they left and the @entity35 showed up			0
even now , more than a month on , their ordeal is not over			0
according to the @entity181 the @entity35 tried to search their house , but they refused to answer the door			0
they say they have a meeting set for next week at @entity35 offices in @entity185 , but do n't know what the outcome will be			0
a @entity35 spokeswoman told the @entity56 that they could n't comment on individual cases , but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13			2
police said they could not find information on the case , but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported , ' we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people ’s welfare			0
