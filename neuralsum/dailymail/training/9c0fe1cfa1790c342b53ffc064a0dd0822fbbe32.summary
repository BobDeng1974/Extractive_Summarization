four - time major winner @entity0 admits time is against him , but has not given up hope of a ' @entity4 ' victory in the masters in april			1
els finished second at @entity6 in 2000 and 2004 - and was sixth , fifth and sixth in the years in between - but has yet to claim a green jacket to go with his two @entity9 and @entity10 victories			1
the 45 - year - old missed the cut in the @entity5 last year and failed to record a tournament victory on either the @entity15 or @entity16 all season , dropping from 27th in the world to 63rd as a result			1
@entity0 plays a shot during practice ahead of the @entity22 in his native @entity23 @entity0 still hopes to add the @entity5 to his collection of majors @entity0 crosses the bridge with @entity27 as he looks to get back to winning ways after a poor 2014 however , the former world number one insists he is as motivated as ever as he seeks a sixth victory in the @entity9 at @entity31 in his native @entity23 this week			1
' i 've played a lot of golf at @entity31 , social rounds , tournament rounds , so there 's a lot of history here for me and it 's wonderful to be back , ' said @entity0 , who is also the tournament host and ambassador			1
@entity0 twice finished runner - up at @entity6 , most recently in 2004 ' i 've always taken the @entity9 as like a fifth major for me , so to be involved in a capacity where i can host and be an ambassador , thus giving something back to the tournament , is just a phenomenal gift that was given to me			1
' i 'm getting on now			0
i 've got this title as host ambassador , so you 'll see me here for a long time at the @entity54 , maybe not as a player later on , but doing what i can			2
' it 's a different dimension that i 'm going into , but as a player right now i feel very motivated to win as many as i can before i 'm done , so to speak - especially playing at this course that i know so well and coming back to my roots			1
' i still have the drive and want to achieve something			0
if i can be greedy i would go with @entity6 for a win - that would be a @entity4 story			2
' local players have an excellent record in @entity15 events on home soil , with five of the eight staged last season being won by @entity22			0
six events will be held in @entity22 this season with @entity74 's @entity73 winning the @entity75 and @entity22 @entity27 tasting victory in the @entity77 in december , while @entity79 's @entity78 defends his @entity9 title this week			2
' it 's really special to be back and try to defend a title for the first time in my career , so obviously when i stepped in the gate and on to the course it brought back a lot of good memories , ' said @entity78 , who managed just one other top - 10 finish last season			2
' walking into the locker room i remember some really good times in there right after the round , and when all the interviews were over and done with , it was just me , my caddie and my dad in there reflecting on what had just happened			0
@entity78 of @entity79 poses with the trophy after winning last year 's @entity9 ' it 's been extremely exciting and fun to play as a winner on the @entity15			1
it 's definitely drawn extra attention , and also some different feelings from within as to how the game should be played			0
' i have n't really performed the way i would have liked to , but i think on some subconscious level i put too much pressure on myself to play well			2
my expectations sort of rose a little bit more than they probably should have , but i would n't have changed a thing			0
' this past year has been a good learning experience that i can use for years to come			0
i feel like i 'm a more experienced player now , and i 'm probably better suited now to play well and have some success on the @entity15			0
when i tee it up tomorrow i 'll be gunning for the best score i can shoot , but i do n't really have expectations			0
