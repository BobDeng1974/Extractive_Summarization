by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 12 may 2013 a new attempt to persuade @entity2 and peers to back a right - to - die law has been branded ‘ orwellian ’ by one of the country ’s leading lawyers			2
@entity8 , the former labour lord chancellor , wants to legalise ‘ assisted dying ’ for terminally ill patients			1
but he has been accused of using ‘ orwellian spin ’ by attempting to distinguish between ‘ assisted suicide ’ and ‘ assisted dying ’			1
critics say there is no difference between the two			0
lord @entity16 , left , said the terms of @entity8 's , right , bill are based on ' euphemisms ' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as ' assisted dying ' rather than ' assisted suicide ' among his critics was leading @entity27 peer @entity25 , who said that giving doctors power to help terminally ill people to die ‘ would not pass the public safety test ’			1
@entity25 , a prominent @entity32 , said in a newspaper article : ‘ advocates of such a law tell us that they are not talking about suicide			1
they say that helping people who are terminally ill to end their lives is not assisting suicide because they are expected to die			1
‘ this is , of course , nonsense			0
in law , as in the @entity48 language , if you take your own life , whatever your state of health , that is suicide ; and a doctor or anyone else who supplies you with the means to do so is assisting suicide			2
‘ @entity54 lawmaking demands clarity			0
it can not be based on euphemisms , verbal evasions or orwellian spin			2
’ @entity8 was also accused of exploiting the impact of right - to - die court cases involving terribly disabled people to win support for the proposal			1
critics said its timing had been ‘ carefully planned ’ to coincide with the hearing of the case of @entity69 , 57 , a severely disabled former lorry driver , who is seeking permission for a doctor to kill him by lethal injection			0
@entity73 , the widow of @entity74 , pictured together , will go to the @entity75 to fight for legal protection from murder charges for doctors if they help a patient die dr @entity80 , a campaigner against euthanasia , said : ‘ @entity8 is using the emotions generated by hard court cases , but his agenda is very dangerous for disabled and elderly people			1
’ @entity8 is planning to table his private member ’s @entity86 before peers on wednesday			1
it will allow adults with six months or less to live to request a doctor ’s help to commit suicide , and supporters say it is bound around with safeguards to prevent abuse			0
his @entity98 follows a report produced last year under his leadership which made a similar call for assisted suicide for the terminally ill. the report said help to die should be available for anyone with 12 months to live , but following widespread criticism that has been cut down to six months			1
it will be the third @entity108 attempt in seven years to legalise assisted dying			1
peers rejected calls for legalisation in 2006 and 2009			0
this week , judges in the @entity75 will begin hearing mr @entity69 ’s case , and the case of a man known only as @entity117 , a victim of locked - in syndrome			0
mr @entity69 , who is quadriplegic , has taken over the claim of @entity74 , another locked - in syndrome victim , who died shortly after losing his case in the @entity123 last year			0
@entity117 is claiming that assisted suicide laws – which set a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail for helping someone kill themselves – break @entity129 of the @entity131 human rights charter , which protects the right to privacy and family life			1
dr @entity80 said : ‘ the timing has been carefully planned			0
off the back of media coverage of this case , @entity8 , who is being backed by @entity137 , the former @entity137 , will argue that his proposal is modest in comparison			2
‘ @entity143 is not terminally ill and wants a doctor to give him a lethal injection			0
@entity8 , however , is only asking for people who are terminally ill to have the right to receive help to kill themselves – assisted suicide			1
’ dr @entity80 added : ‘ the last thing we need is a change in the law to put more pressure on people who already feel themselves to be a burden to others			0
’ assisted suicide laws were effectively reformed without any @entity108 vote by @entity160 , the director of public prosecutions , in 2010			2
following instructions passed down in one of the last cases heard by the @entity164 , mr @entity160 issued guidelines that said no - one is likely to be prosecuted for helping someone to die if they are a family member or friend , rather than a professional , and if they act out of compassion and not greed			2
between 150 and 200 people are thought to have gone to the @entity177 clinic in @entity178 to be helped to commit suicide			0
but no family member who helped has ever been prosecuted .			0

@entity8 wants to legalise assisted suicide for terminally people
his private member 's @entity86 will go before the @entity186 on wednesday
but it has been criticised for terming doctors helping a patient to die as ' assisted dying ' instead of ' assisted suicide '
@entity25 of @entity193 said law can not be based on ' euphemisms '
