these images show the enormous scale of the world 's biggest saw - capable of mining more than 4,500 tons of coal per hour			1
weighing in at 45,000 tons , the monster saw can slice its way through virtually anything , including huge mountains made entirely of coal			1
the colossal piece of machinery , known as a bucket wheel excavator , is so big it takes 27 miners just to operate it at any one time			1
incredibly , the diameter of the saw alone spans nearly 12 metres - about the same height as a four - storey building - while a single machine can cost up to £ 66million to produce			1
its hulking mass and height of 45 metres means it can only travel one mile every three hours			2

mr @entity51 said : ' i have never seen a machine as big as this one although i have seen many powerful machines in the past			0
' i got to see the saw as part of photography assignment for the @entity25 mining industry			0
i could n't believe its size when i got up close			0
' it is used in the mining of coal and can actually mine 4,500 tons of coal per hour , it really is an extraordinary piece of equipment			1

the saw is so big it requires 27 people to operate it at any one time do n't look down : the enormous scale of the contraption is shown in this image taken from the top of the 45 metre - high structure mr @entity51 was granted a rare opportunity to picture the giant saw and said he was left in ' awe of its power and design ' ' i was not scared to get so close but was more in awe of its power and design			2
' about 40 million tons of coal is taken from the @entity22 mines every year , accounting for 40 per cent of the nation 's coal output			2
in 1985 it entered the @entity140 for being the world 's largest single coal mine when 56.8 million tonnes of coal were taken from the ground .			0

the 45,000 ton piece of machinery can be found at the @entity22 near the city of @entity24 in @entity25
monster saw , known as a bucket wheel excavator , is so big 27 miners are needed to operate it at any one time
diameter of saw component alone spans 12 metres while a single machine can cost up to £ 66million to produce
although it can only travel one mile every three hours it is capable of scooping out 4,500 tons of coal in *60* minutes
