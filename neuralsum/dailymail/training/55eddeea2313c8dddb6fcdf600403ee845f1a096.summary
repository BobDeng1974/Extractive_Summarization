@entity0 is under pressure to hand back a £ 65,000 ‘ golden goodbye ’ he received from taxpayers when he last stood down from @entity4			1
the former first minister received a so - called ‘ resettlement grant ’ when he gave up his @entity7 and @entity8 seat in 2010 , but is now plotting a return to the @entity10 in next year ’s election			1
the money is intended to assist outgoing mps in ‘ adjusting to non-parliamentary life ’ , even though mr @entity0 has remained in politics			1
the first £ 30,000 was tax free , leaving a net sum of around £ 50,000 – half of which mr @entity0 donated to a charity named after his late mother			2
the resettlement scheme has since been reformed and will be restricted to a maximum of six months ’ salary come next may , with only those @entity14 who fight and lose their seat eligible			2
it is set to be watered down once again after 2015			0
last night , @entity43 msp @entity41 said : ‘ with @entity0 seeking a return to @entity4 , the public would generally accept that this money has been paid inappropriately			1
' mr @entity41 added : ‘ when cash from the taxpayer has been paid out inappropriately , it should be returned			0
and that ’s not just the cash he kept , but the money he gave away too			2
’ on sunday , mr @entity0 announced that he will seek the @entity19 ’s nomination to stand in the north - east seat of @entity21 , which overlaps his @entity23 constituency			1
it is held by @entity60 grandee sir @entity59 with a commanding majority of 6,748 , however he is standing down and support for his party is expected to collapse in may ’s election			0
mr @entity0 was previously an mp for nearby @entity7 and @entity8 from 1987 until 2010 , with his length of service entitling him to the full £ 65,000 resettlement grant when he stood down from the @entity10			1
@entity69 's @entity68 stood down from @entity23 for her seat in @entity4 and gave her entire resettlement grant to charity during a televised leaders ’ debate in 2010 , @entity75 @entity74 mp @entity73 asked him : ‘ the resettlement grant is for people leaving politics so , @entity0 , are you intending to leave politics ? ’ mr @entity0 replied that he would make a ‘ further substantial donation ’ into a charitable trust named after his late mother that helps youth organisations in @entity88			1
‘ i know of no person previously in @entity4 politics who has said he will donate from the resettlement grant to worthy work in the @entity94 of @entity75 , ’ he said			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ unfortunately for you and your party , @entity97 , i intend to be here for some time to take this nation to freedom			2
’ if he is successful in his attempt to represent @entity21 , mr @entity0 will still be an msp for @entity23 until at least 2016			2
he will receive a ‘ dual mandate ’ salary made up of his mp wage and a third of his msp salary , and has promised to donate the extra cash to charity			0
an @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the fact that the @entity74 seem to have conceded that they expect @entity0 to be elected in @entity21 is a welcome one , but must do little for the morale of their own candidate			0
‘ after tax paid , half of the resettlement grant was donated to charity and mr @entity0 has made clear that if he is elected and holds a dual mandate , one of his salaries will also be donated to support good causes in the @entity94 - just as he did previously			1
‘ to date the @entity123 has already received £ 100,000 in this way to support young people in the @entity94 of @entity75			0
’ the former first minister is also the final recipient of a controversial non-contributory pension scheme which entitles him to a sum equivalent to half his salary			0
however , he has vowed to hand the £ 42,000 - a - year deal to the @entity123			0
in 2011 , @entity69 ’s dual mandate @entity0 / msp @entity68 stood down from @entity23 and gave her entire resettlement grant to charity			1
meanwhile , mr @entity0 yesterday said he wants to be an mp to ‘ to keep hope alive ’ for people who voted for @entity75 independence			2
he said the @entity60 are now a ‘ busted flush ’ but he expects ‘ strong competition ’ from the conservatives in @entity21			0
however , sitting mp sir @entity141 said : ‘ the people of @entity75 and the people of the @entity144 have got to make a decision : what kind of government do you want ? ‘ do you want chaos , multi-party inability to make decisions ? we 've had a strong government that has been able to do that			0
or do you want the @entity19 causing disruption and not representing the interests of the people , certainly of @entity21 , who did n't vote to send members to @entity4 to break up the @entity144 but actually want @entity75 and the @entity144 to work together for the people of @entity21 ? ’			0
