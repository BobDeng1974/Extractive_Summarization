by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 17:32 est , 9 october 2013 three daughters of disgraced lord @entity2 said yesterday they are ‘ sad and bitterly heartbroken ’ that a family war against their brother has ended up in the courts			1
their comments came on the first day of a @entity8 hearing at which they are battling for a share of their late father ’s estate			0
the sisters , including author and former tv presenter @entity15 , say they are entitled to a proportion of the £ 12million estate plus further assets – a claim their brother @entity20 , the seventh @entity21 , contests			1
taking legal action : @entity24 and her sister @entity15 ( right ) outside the @entity8 after today 's hearing into their case disputing the inheritance of their late father @entity2 family dispute : the @entity33 's daughters have told a top judge they are ' sad and bitterly heartbroken ' that a family dispute over their father 's estate has ended up in court forty years ago @entity2 was at the centre of one of the raciest scandals of his day when he was photographed cavorting in bed with two prostitutes			1
@entity2 was forced to resign in 1973 , when he was photographed in bed with two dominatrix prostitutes the then junior defence minister was forced to resign and later fled to @entity47 where he spent the remaining 30 years of his life living in a mansion in @entity51 with his mistress , @entity52			1
when he died aged 84 in 2006 he left his fortune to his only son @entity54 under the @entity56 tradition of primogeniture by which the male heir inherits not only the title but also the entire estate			1
in the years after his death , three of his five daughters demanded a slice of the family fortune because all children have a right to an equal share under @entity69 law			0
they had been in negotiations with their brother and his lawyers and were hoping to receive about £ 1million each in return for giving up a much larger claim			0
but lord @entity20 , 52 , served a @entity8 writ in may this year in @entity76 to prevent them making claims on his inheritance in @entity47			1
the move upset @entity81 , 70 , and her sisters @entity83 , 64 , and lady @entity84 , 59 , an actress			1
it was argued at the court in @entity87 yesterday that under @entity69 law , all six of @entity2 ’s children are entitled to one - ninth each of their father ’s ‘ heritable property ’			2
the daughters claim the @entity69 courts should decide what they receive given that @entity2 spent his last years in the country			0
their counsel @entity96 told the court the proceedings in @entity76 should be stayed and the case should go ahead in @entity47			2
he said the sisters ‘ are sad and bitterly heartbroken that this family dispute should have entered into the courts at all ’			0
he said their action in seeking a stay was ‘ designed to stop this litigation in order to reach a resolution as soon as possible ’			0
the court heard that the estate of £ 12.1million was comprised of only certain movable assets , some paintings found in @entity76 and a small amount of cash			2
but mr @entity113 said that during his lifetime @entity2 owned valuable assets , including fine collections of paintings , furniture , books and wine , and money in trusts , so the estate could be worth much more			2
that could put the sisters ’ claim under @entity69 law ‘ in the region of millions of pounds ’			0
lord @entity20 claims the @entity76 court should deal with the matter			1
his counsel @entity131 said @entity2 had remained a @entity56 citizen			0
notorious : @entity2 at the @entity134 , the magnificent 12 - bedroom pile in rural @entity51 @entity136 : @entity137 with his mother @entity138 known as @entity139 and sisters , who are now at war			0

former @entity144 minister died in 2006 and left estate to heir @entity20
@entity54 served writ on three of five sisters to prevent them making claims
@entity81 , @entity83 and @entity24 have returned to court to fight it
@entity2 *wrecked* his *career* after being caught in bed with prostitutes
he lived in @entity47 until he died and they are *fighting* for £ 12m fortune there
