mrs @entity2 and her husband @entity10 had been trying for a baby for nine years when they signed up to what was then an experimental procedure , in vitro fertilisation			1
she became pregnant at the first attempt , and 5lb 12oz @entity2 was born by caesarean section at @entity18 at 11.47pm on july 25 , 1978			1
the event , which gave hope to countless infertile couples , captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the @entity24 under the headline @entity26			2
four years later mrs @entity2 , who could n’t become pregnant naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked , conceived a second daughter , @entity28 , by @entity29			2
since those pioneering days more than four million babies around the world have been born through @entity29 , in which a woman ’s eggs are fertilised with sperm outside the body and then implanted into the womb			0

although other women had been implanted with fertilised eggs , mrs @entity2 was the first to achieve a pregnancy which went beyond a few weeks			2

she said : ‘ if it was n’t for @entity82 and @entity68 i would n’t have this family			0
