the world ’s first cloned camel is pregnant , scientists claim			1
the mother - to - be , whose name is @entity5 , was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a surrogate mother			1
@entity5 was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally			1
the world ’s first cloned camel is pregnant , scientists claim			1
the mother - to - be , whose name is @entity5 , was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother			1
@entity5 is pictured here when she was just six days old dr @entity14 , scientific director of the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , told @entity18 : ‘ we are very excited because @entity5 is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year			1
‘ she has conceived in a natural way			2
this will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels			2
’ the birth of @entity5 , whose name means ' achievement ' in @entity30 , caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population			1
camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the @entity39 , and are used for racing and transport			0
they can also produce low - fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests			2
since @entity5 was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner			1
it 's 19 years since the first mammal was cloned			2
dolly the sheep ( pictured ) was born in @entity53 using dna from an adult cell since @entity5 was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner , the @entity56 reported			1
it took five years of work before @entity5 was cloned			1
she was born on april 8 , 2009 weighing 66lbs ( 30kg ) , after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days			2
the calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel			2
the cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother			1
@entity5 was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from , according to @entity72 newspapers at the time			1
the world 's first mammal was cloned 19 years ago			2
dolly the sheep was born in @entity53 using @entity54 from an adult cell			0
@entity78 was put down in 2003 , after being diagnosed with lung disease , but since then , scientists have successfully cloned mice , cows , pigs and dogs as well as camels			0
human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time , according to scientists			0
researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in @entity96 that has introduced @entity54 changes to reproductive cells			0
many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren			0
human embryos , like the one above , may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques they say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications			0
they have described it as ' dangerous and ethically unacceptable '			0
however , others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers			0
until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin , muscle , nerves , bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases			0
modifying the dna of human embryos so that @entity54 changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations			0
such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the @entity143 , but is permitted in the @entity144 and @entity96			0
a number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos .			0

cloned camel was born in 2009 and called @entity152 , which means achievement
she was cloned from ovarian cells and born by surrogate mother
@entity5 is now six years old and is said to have conceived naturally
she 's expected to give birth late this year , proving cloned animals ' fertility
