rioters are being sentenced too harshly and should be treated like any other case in the courts , according to the head of the @entity4			0
director of public prosecutions @entity5 insisted that those involved in last month 's disturbances should not be regarded as a ' separate category ' or dealt with differently from other criminals			2
his comments come amid concern that sentences being handed down to rioters are disproportionate			1
some surveys have even suggesting they are a quarter longer than normal			1
riots : the teenage looter , who can not be identified , flees from the @entity17 store in @entity18 , south @entity19 on friday a 17 - year - old girl who stole a bottle of @entity22 and some sweets from @entity17 during the civil unrest was jailed for eight months			1
mr @entity5 did not criticise the sentencing of rioters but stressed : ' we should not treat these cases as a separate category to be dealt with differently			0
jailed : the 17 - year - old was given eight months behind bars after stealing @entity22 and a number of other items ' we should treat them as we do any other case			1
we need to keep our feet on the ground			0
in other areas , such as big terrorism cases , we have resisted the temptation to call for special measures			0
with disorder cases , we should adopt the same approach , ' he said to the @entity44			0
another example of harsh sentencing includes a @entity48 soldier who was jailed for 13 months after she admitted stealing a television			1
@entity50 , 19 , who is part of the @entity48 's bomb disposal unit , walked off with the television as looters raided an @entity56 store in @entity57 , south east @entity19			2
@entity50 had never been in trouble with the police before			0
@entity60 , 30 , joined looters as they ransacked a phone shop during the riots was jailed for 13 months			2
the lifeguard drunkenly followed looters into @entity66 in @entity67 , south @entity19 , after leaving a nearby pub. @entity69 heard how he was caught by police crawling out of the store , which suffered £ 25,000 of losses , beneath security shutters empty - handed			2
a doctor 's daughter , who can not be named for legal reasons , stole a bottle of @entity22 and helped herself to some t - shirts and a pair of sunglasses as violence broke out in @entity18			1
the 17 - year - old , who handed herself in to police , has been jailed for eight months and has been described as ' quiet and intelligent '			1
mr @entity5 also dismissed the idea that human rights legislation was a factor in last month 's outbreak of violence and looting			0
prime minister @entity91 , by contrast , has praised the ' tough message ' that the courts have been sending out in a recent interview accused the @entity95 of making excuses for last month 's rioters			1
his remarks came following a row with @entity95 presenter @entity100 who asked mr @entity91 whether there was any difference between his own membership of the @entity105 at @entity106 and the rioters			2
an irritated mr @entity91 said everyone did stupid things when they were young but dismissed any comparison with the ' organised looting and stealing and thieving ' seen across the @entity112 last month			2
mr @entity91 has promised to step up his crusade to mend @entity112 's ' broken society ' and said a ' misinterpretation ' of human rights laws had undermined the idea of people taking responsibility for their actions			1
he also underlined the need for more discipline in schools and said there need to be tougher measures to end welfare dependency			0
awkward : @entity100 tried to link rioting to the antics of those in the @entity105 which prime minister @entity91 was a member of mr @entity91 said problem youngsters needed ‘ tough love ’ , adding : ‘ you need both elements of it			1
‘ for some of these children there probably was a shortage of love			0
but you do need , when they cross the line and break the law , to be very tough			0
’ but the @entity4 chief said : ' i do n't think human rights could be listed as one of the causes			0
' no doubt there will be analysis of the possible causes , but to me human rights would not be among them			0
' too harsh : @entity5 has warned that sentences handed out to rioters are too long			1

17 - year - old girl who stole bottle of @entity22 and some sweets jailed for eight months
@entity91 said today 's youngsters need ' tough love '
sentences being handed down are a quarter longer than normal
