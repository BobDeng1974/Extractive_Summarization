those clever marketing guys at @entity1 have stepped things up a level with this year 's @entity5 advert			1
late night shopping may never be the same again after you watch @entity1 ’s homage to @entity10 ’s horror classic , @entity11			1
the clip begins with a view from behind of a boy on a tricycle - mirroring when @entity16 begins his ferocious hallway pedal scene			2
the young boy sets off on his tricycle journey in @entity1 's latest video he cycles past a couple of skeletons enjoying some dinner in a kitchen the boys continues to motor his way through what looks like a deserted warehouse what follows is the youngster taking us on a journey through what appears an abandoned warehouse			1
in reality it is @entity1 's @entity39 store			1
cycling past one unit , the @entity5 theme is all to evident as two skeletons sit in a kitchen			1
twisting and turning past sofas , beds and high - end tables , while keeping the speed up , the boy turns the corner only to be met by two not - so little girls dressed in blue who ask him to ' come play			1
' the one on the right seems at this point a man wearing a dress			0
@entity16 is then met by ' two little girls ' who block his path they say to the boy that they want to play @entity16 is now scared and his journey has come to an abrupt halt ' come play with us @entity16 , ' say the pair in unison as the boy begins to cover his eyes and recoil in fear			1
then peeking through the gaps in his fingers , things turn to normality			0
' come play with us @entity16 , come on ' , say a now more appropriately dressed couple extending their hands out			0
he uses his hands to cover his face in fright - but ca n't resist peering through the gaps in his fingers but instead of ' two little girls ' he is met by his parents , who tell him that they have to go and all is right with the world , as @entity16 realises it was all just a bad dream the boy smiles , showing huge relief and runs towards his parents as they say ' let 's go			1
' it 's not the first time the @entity93 company have done their own parody video			0
back in september @entity1 one - upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka ' bookbook ' - a play on @entity101 's @entity100			1
the scene from @entity10 's hit film @entity11 , of @entity16 cycling through the hallway			0
the film was an adaptation of @entity108 's novel			0
' the interface is 7.5 x 8 inches			0
but can expand to 15 x 8 inches , ' the narrator explains this parody video was particularly timely as @entity101 was gearing up to launch the new @entity112 with what was a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign			1
' once in awhile , something comes along that changes the way we live , ' the advertisement began			0
' a device so simple and intuitive , using it feels almost familiar			0
' introducing the 2015 @entity1 catalogue			2
' the advert demonstrates the ' bookbook 's ' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it the entire advert is narrated by @entity127 , dubbed the chief design guru ' the first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable , ' @entity132 continues			2
' not even a power cable			0
the 2015 @entity1 catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal			2
' thoughts will now be turning to their @entity137 offering , and what tricks they have up their @entity93 sleeves next			0
oh , and @entity1 is open until 11pm daily during the @entity5 season - the point of the spoof video .			2
