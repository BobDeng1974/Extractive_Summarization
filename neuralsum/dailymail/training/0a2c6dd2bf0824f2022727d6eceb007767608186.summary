wearing colourful baggy trousers , and smiling widely behind his face paint , bozo the clown appears in front of a group of school children and cries : ' do you want to play ? ' he looks just like an innocent entertainer but second later ' @entity11 ' screeches like a maniac and - as the pupils flee in horror - chases them into a nearby park brandishing a gun and a sharpened stick			1
this is no @entity20 prank , but the face of a disturbing new trend sweeping @entity24 and @entity25 : clown terror attacks inspired by @entity24 serial killer @entity21			1
for the first time @entity28 can reveal who is behind the macabre craze - a 19 - year - old butcher 's apprentice who developed a sinister obsession with the circus act			1
teenager @entity36 , who now has a criminal conviction for premeditated violence with a weapon , marauded through the town of @entity41 , northern @entity42			1
he is one of dozens of students , teenagers and schoolchildren as young as 14 who have become consumed by the ' evil clown ' phenomenon			1
freaky : a sinister clown craze sweeping @entity42 has seen dozens of teenagers don costumes and terrorise children			1
prank group clowns of the @entity55 boast of stunts like this in @entity58 , northern @entity42 twisted : the macabre craze is said to be inspired by serial killer @entity21 from the tv series @entity62 ashamed : @entity36 butcher @entity36 can now be revealed as one of the clowns terrorising children in @entity41 , northern @entity42 the mania has escalated to such a degree that vigilante mobs have formed in @entity42 to chase away the clowns and the village of @entity71 , in the south of the country , has just placed an official ban on ‘ evil clowns ’			1
mayor @entity76 said : ‘ it 's about protecting children by preventing ill - intentioned clowns threatening residents			1
’ the sinister movement started in the @entity24 , mainly thanks to tv series called ‘ @entity83 ’ , which centres on the serial killer @entity85			1
the fictional character stalks couples with scissors and imprisons children in an old school bus			2
now however it has spread to @entity25 , where police in @entity42 have been forced to issue a warning against vigilante mobs , stating : ' any person , aggressive clowns or hunters of clowns , discovered in possession of a weapon on the highway will be arrested			1
' police arrested 14 teenagers dressed as clowns and carrying weapons in the @entity106 port town of @entity107 on october 25			2
but because they are underage they can not be identified - and @entity109 is the only attacker who can be named and shamed so far			2
he had a record for ‘ minor offences ’ around his home town , and had developed a ‘ fascination ’ with clowns , said a legal source close to the case			2
the source added : ‘ he became obsessed with this craze			0
it started off as a means of bullying younger kids , which is bad enough , but it has turned into something even more sinister			0
’ @entity36 himself , who got away with a six month suspended sentence , 105 hours community service , and a ban on carrying any kind of weapon for five years , said : ‘ i know it was n’t funny , i ’m just really sorry			0
’ @entity131 : the craze started in @entity133 , while in @entity135 a clown was spotted in @entity136 ( above ) but did not terrorise children			2
police in @entity42 have now issued an appeal against vigilante mobs armed : at a court appearance @entity141 confessed to carrying an air pistol that looked like a live ammunition gun to target children during his appearance at a court in @entity148 last week , @entity36 admitted heading out at twilight on a friday night in early october			1
he was wearing a wig , burnt cork smeared across his face , and multi-coloured clothing picked up in a novelty shop			0
an air pistol looking just like a live ammunition gun and the heavy stick were his chosen arms			1
despite @entity36 ’s apology , and his considerable efforts to avoid identification in court , the so - called ' clowns of the @entity55 ' gang to which he belonged continue to cause terror across the region			2
they carry anything they can lay their hands on – from chainsaws and axes to knives and baseball bats			0
fake blood and dummies are often used to make the attacks even more chilling			0
@entity36 would not expand on what motivated his crimes , but his tearful mother , @entity181 , was prepared to offer her version of events			0
‘ my son disguised himself as a clown as joke for his mates , ’ she told @entity28			1
‘ he went out , unarmed , without anything			0
‘ he picked up a stick in the park , where there were a lot of young people			2
he made them scared , that ’s certain , but he had no weapon with him , never			0
’ referring to the owner of a fast food van who confronted her son , mrs @entity181 said : ‘ the chip fryer came round to our house with a weapon			0
it was then that my son panicked and returned home			0
macabre : mystery clowns that are terrorizing @entity133 towns at night have started carrying guns in a movement that has spread to @entity25 copycat : clowns allegedly carrying guns have been seen in @entity133 in a frightening attempt to copy the activities of @entity85 , from the @entity24 series @entity62 ‘ i ’ve got an airgun that fires tear gas pellets			1
my son was scared so he went out with it , but there was no premeditation			0
’ mrs @entity181 claimed @entity36 was being punished unfairly			0
‘ my fear is that he is suffering because of what all the other clowns have been doing , ’ she said			0
however , mrs @entity181 conceded : ‘ i want to shake him , to make him understand that he should n’t have done that to kids			0
’ she admits that the first person her son came across was a six - year - old living next door , and he is still traumatised by what he saw			1
the chilling events in @entity41 , not far from @entity42 ’s border with @entity237 , have been replicated dozens of times in recent weeks			1
police have stepped up patrols in a bid to clamp down on the craze , one which has led to a series of disturbing attacks			2
the clowns of the @entity55 have their own @entity247 page , with a main page reading : ‘ @entity249 ’			0
a member who lives in the town of @entity252 , and who asked solely to be referred to as @entity254 , said : ‘ it ’s a cool craze which comes from @entity24 – it ’s the mixture of fun and mischief which really appeals to us			1
‘ we stand there with balloons and a happy look on our face and then – bang – we ’re scaring people out of their skins ! ‘ it does no real harm – the fake weapons used are n’t meant to hurt anyone			0
we ’d much rather just make a funny video and stick it online ’			0
creepy : the trend spread to @entity136 where budding film - maker @entity274 posted images of himself on @entity247 - but insisted he was not harming anyone but @entity277 , the director of public safety in the @entity280 region , said @entity36 ’s arrest and conviction should send out the right message			1
‘ this kind of behaviour just is n’t acceptable , ’ said mr @entity277			0
‘ there ’s been a domino effect , with lots of people getting involved all over @entity42			1
when there is aggression , real or simulated , this behaviour just is n’t allowed			0
’ mr @entity277 said a lot of the worst violence happened when people fought back			0
there have already been a number of vigilante attacks			2
in @entity300 , a fake clown beat someone up with an iron bar , while drivers in the city have complained of ‘ very scary clowns ’ threatening them			2
a @entity42 video of a man dressed as a clown pretending to club people to death in front of terrified passers - by has had almost 30 million hits			1
@entity85 , from the @entity24 series @entity62 , is known to have influenced @entity42 's fake clowns			1
so too has the case of @entity24 serial killer and rapist @entity319 , who was executed in 1994 for murdering 33 people			1
@entity319 regularly dressed up as a funny man for children ’s parties , and became known as the ‘ @entity324 ’			0
‘ there nothing fun about any of this , ’ said one of the police officers who dealt with @entity36 ’s case			2
' it ’s a sinister craze , and it ’s getting out of hand			0
' last year @entity136 became the focus of a clown craze when budding filmmaker @entity274 dressed as a clown and posted pictures of himself on @entity247			1
however , he said the pranks were intended to amuse people and did not terrorise children .			0
