@entity15 claimed she was headhunted by hospital bosses and asked to ' fix ' the figures to cover up the true extent of the hospital 's failings			1
mrs @entity15 was suspended by the @entity5 after repeatedly raising her concerns – and in march last year spoke to the @entity21 about fears that she had been hired to make the death rates look better			1
last week she received a letter via email ordering her to attend a disciplinary hearing			1
the letter also revealed she could be fired for speaking out			1
the threat is totally at odds with repeated assurances from the government and the chief executive of the @entity9 that whistleblowers acting in the public interest will be protected			1
in the letter , hospital bosses claimed the 50 - year - old ' behaved recklessly or negligently ' by going public ' without the @entity5 's authorisation to do so '			1
the hospital also accused the whistleblower of breaching her employment contract by ignoring confidentiality agreements and rules regarding speaking to the @entity42			1
the letter adds : ' the hearing will be held in order to consider the facts of this case , and you should be aware that this may result in formal disciplinary action , not excluding dismissal			2
' the @entity21 last year revealed the case of whistleblower @entity52 – a former hospitals chief in @entity54 who broke a £ 500,000 gagging clause to raise urgent concerns about patient safety and high death rates			1
the scandal prompted health secretary @entity60 to insist he would ban gagging clauses , declaring : ' the era of gagging @entity9 staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end			2
' last night @entity68 , the @entity69 chairman of the @entity70 , warned any hospital which tried to sack a whistleblower could face action from @entity9 executives			2
' if it can be shown information has been disclosed in the public interest then any attempt to take disciplinary action against that person should prompt action against the hospital by @entity9 management , ' he told the @entity21			2
threat : @entity84 and an edited version of the letter she received former health secretary mr @entity68 said legal safeguards and assurances by @entity9 chief executive sir @entity89 protected whistleblowers			1
mrs @entity15 was a health coder – administrators who record details of the care received by patients			2
they do not need medical qualifications and have been accused of having too much influence over how hospitals are found to be performing			0
mrs @entity15 , who is originally from @entity100 , was hired by @entity101 in october 2011 after it scored one of the highest mortality rates in the country , with concerns raised over high numbers of deaths at weekends			1
she had previously worked at @entity109 , where she had overseen an improvement in coding following the hospital scandal there			0
mrs @entity15 said conditions at @entity101 were as bad or worse as those at @entity116 , where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly			0
but rather than improving patient care , she believed the hospital wanted to improve its shocking death rates			1
bosses offered to almost double her salary to £ 54,000 a year in the belief that she had distorted death figures at @entity116 and could do the same for them			1
she refused to do this but realised others at the trust were ' breaking every rule in the book '			0
she claimed coders were using tenuous excuses to record too many deaths at the hospital under ' palliative care ' category			0
this meant their deaths – officially classed as unavoidable – would not alter the hospital 's highly scrutinised mortality @entity140 care focuses on relieving the suffering of patients			0
figures show between 2009 and 2011 the death rate at @entity101 fell by 13 per cent , from very poor levels to the national average			1
at the same time , the number of deaths recorded as ' palliative care ' rose from 2.19 per cent to 20.3 per cent , about double the national average			0
when she blew the whistle internally , she was told not to put the allegations in writing because ' the @entity42 can get hold of it through @entity158 '			0
nine months after starting work for @entity101 , she was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment			2
she believes this was simply a way of silencing her			0
mrs @entity15 , who sought no payment for her story and is suspended on full pay , said she faced ruin if she was sacked			2
' i 've been sick to my stomach for three days , ' she said			0
' i feel like @entity89 fighting @entity171			0
i 've just been telling the truth			0
' a @entity174 spokesman said : ' we have been absolutely clear that staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out … must be protected and listened to			0
' the @entity179 refused to comment			0
in the past it insisted it was ' categorically false ' to suggest palliative care patients had been coded incorrectly to cut death rates .			1

@entity84 raised concerns about ' fixed ' figures
she feared she had been hired to make death rates look better
then @entity5 suspended her
last week a letter revealed she could be fired for speaking out
threat is totally at odds with repeated @entity197 assurances
