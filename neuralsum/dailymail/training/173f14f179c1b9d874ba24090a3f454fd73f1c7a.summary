a study across 17 crucial @entity11 - @entity1 marginal constituencies found that the @entity1 vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party ’s mps are set to lose to @entity11 challengers			1
the @entity1 are braced to lose more seats to @entity17 in the north of the country , where their vote has also slumped since 2010			1

the @entity1 vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party ¿ s mps are set to lose to @entity11 challengers , a new poll has shown they will also embolden senior @entity11 who want to kick the @entity1 while they are down			1
@entity1 mps on the left of the party claim they have been approached by members of the 1922 committee of @entity29 backbenchers seeking allies for a plot to try to break up the coalition			2
senior conservatives on the committee , said to be planning to stage a vote on whether the coalition parties should go their separate ways , apparently believe the move would be more credible if it was backed by some @entity1 too			0

research by pollster @entity52 , pictured , provided the first comprehensive impression of how the two parties are faring in marginal seats the study across 17 @entity11 - @entity1 marginal seats found that the vote share for @entity64 ’s party was down eight points since 2010 to 33 per cent , but the @entity1 were down 15 per cent to 28 per cent			1
the polls found an overall 3.5 per cent swing from the @entity1 to their coalition partners in the seats since 2010 , enough for the @entity29 to unseat as many as 15 @entity71 if this were to happen across the board at the general election next may			1
however , there were signs of big regional variations			0
swings ranged from one per cent @entity1 to the @entity29 in @entity78 in @entity79 to 4.5 per cent from @entity29 to @entity1 in @entity80 and @entity81 in south @entity82			0
lord @entity52 noted that the @entity1 are ‘ famously tenacious local campaigners ’ whose activists have a record of ‘ incessant leaflet mongering ’			0
he said the polling ‘ suggests that in some places @entity24 ’s party may indeed defy the national trend ’ but ‘ according to this snapshot the party risks losing a dozen or more seats to the @entity29 ’			2
across the 17 seats , six of which are held by the conservatives and 11 by mr @entity24 ’s party , the poll put the @entity11 on 33 % ( -8 ) , @entity1 on 28 % ( -15 ) , @entity99 18 % ( +14 ) and @entity17 on 14 % ( +5 )			1
the @entity11 would hold their six marginal seats included in the survey - @entity101 and @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , @entity78 , @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , and @entity110			1
among the 11 @entity1 seats polled , seven would be won by the @entity11 : @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity113 and @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121			2
mps whose seats would be lost include @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
the @entity1 would hold three - @entity80 and @entity81 , @entity131 , and @entity132 - while the polling resulted in a dead heat in @entity135			2
across the 17 seats @entity99 ’s vote share ranged from 11 per cent in @entity106 and @entity107 to 26 per cent in @entity101 and @entity103 , with just over one in six 2010 conservative voters saying they would vote for @entity140 ’s party			0
business secretary @entity142 's closest ally , @entity141 , pictured , quit the @entity1 after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in @entity1 seats to show the party would do better without mr @entity24 lord @entity52 said : ‘ @entity99 are not just a problem for the @entity11			1
those who voted @entity1 at the last election were as likely to say they would switch to @entity99 ( 13 % ) as to say they would switch to @entity17 ( 13 % )			2
a further 11 % said they intended to vote @entity29			0
‘ the party is literally losing votes right , left and centre			0
‘ the @entity1 are in their current position not because of anything @entity24 himself has done or not done , but because his party is in government with the @entity29 - a decision endorsed by the whole party through its exhaustive processes of internal democracy			1
‘ the centre - right coalition already has a left - wing alternative , led by @entity167			0
former @entity1 voters who switched because they were dismayed that the party entered office with the @entity11 would only consider coming back if the party promised not to make the same decision in 2015 , no matter what the election result			1
‘ such a declaration is surely unthinkable , or ought to be for a party that wants to have any influence on the nation ’s affairs			0
’ last month , business secretary @entity142 ’s closest ally , @entity141 , quit the @entity1 after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in @entity1 seats to show the party would do better without mr @entity24			2
the former @entity181 spokesman , who leaked the poll findings in a botched coup attempt against mr @entity24 , said the deputy prime minister had robbed the party of its ‘ roots , principles and values ’ .			0
