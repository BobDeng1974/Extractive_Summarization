job security is an issue that concerns us all , but particularly so if you ’re a football manager			0
@entity4 , though , does n’t have to worry			2
@entity7 , the @entity6 ’s job is safe as houses			0
how many managers have that luxury in the @entity12 ? none , probably			0
rightly or wrongly , @entity4 has made himself untouchable in north @entity14			2
@entity16 's @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity18 ( left to right ) trudge off the pitch after @entity16 threw away a three - goal lead to draw with @entity21 in the @entity22 @entity4 , pictured a the @entity23 at the @entity24 on wednesday , is fully secure in his position as @entity16 boss despite the club 's recent poor form that notion has split opinion among supporters			1
there are those who remember the good times , the @entity12 titles , the @entity36 and the @entity37			0
but there are those who can not forgot about the barren years ; those who are fed up with the club ’s perennial underachievement			2
last season ’s @entity44 triumph against @entity46 - their first trophy in nine seasons - was quickly followed by the announcement of @entity4 ’s new three - year contract			1
@entity53 ’s extra time @entity52 winner was supposed to herald a new era of @entity4 domination			2
@entity56 looks ecstatic after scoring @entity21 's last - minute equaliser at the @entity24 @entity4 speaks to the conference during the @entity23 at the @entity24 on the back of two disappointing results , both in which they inexplicably gave away leads , that dream of a dominant @entity16 seems a world away			1
@entity4 has already thrown in the towel in the title race , while the @entity67 look destined for a second place finish in their @entity22 group , meaning they are likely to meet one of @entity72 ’s superpowers in the last 16			1
apply a similar scenario at , say , @entity74 or @entity75			0
would @entity76 or @entity77 have the same level of job security ? probably not			0
unless @entity4 decides to walk away from the @entity24 ( and he has been very open with his views on breaking contracts ) , the @entity6 will remain at the helm until at least 2017			1
but that ’s not to say there is n’t any forward planning in place at @entity16			1
the club are certainly planning for life without @entity4 ; keeping abreast , doing their research , on the best emerging managerial talent in @entity72			1
wenger and former @entity93 cricket head coach @entity92 ( right ) were both at the @entity95 @entity96 attempts to help @entity97 off the turf after @entity16 's 3 - 3 draw with @entity21 there are the obvious candidates : @entity103 ’s @entity102 , @entity105 manager @entity104 and @entity107 ’s @entity106			1
then there are the less obvious , @entity110 ’s former manager @entity109 ( currently unemployed ) has caught the eye , while @entity113 ’s @entity112 and @entity115 ’s @entity114 are also being studied			0
they ’ve even researched managers in the obscure @entity118 to have a succession plan in place once @entity4 calls it a day			2
the @entity67 board know @entity4 ’s reign is in its final throws , and want to make sure they have the right man			2
an aerial view of the conference at the @entity24 which @entity4 ( back right ) spoke at on wednesday @entity16 watched on with interest to see how @entity129 would deal with the departure of sir @entity131			1
the @entity134 club ’s demise has certainly not gone unnoticed by the powers that be at the @entity24			0
and the @entity67 know they can not afford a similar plight and are determined to get their next managerial appointment right			0
they do n’t want to make a ‘ flavour of the month ’ appointment			0
they have two - and - and - half years worth of homework still to do ensure they make the correct appointment			0
in saying that , who ’s to say @entity4 wo n’t want to carry on past his 67th birthday ? @entity145 rises above the @entity16 defence to scores @entity149 's winner in their 2 - 1 victory @entity151 considering @entity16 exit			1

@entity16 have failed to win either of last two matches despite leading both
@entity4 's future is fully secure and he has a contract until 2017
club already looking for potential successor but will not sack @entity4
@entity16 want to ensure they have *transition* in place when @entity4 goes
@entity4 has already given up on title race after *sunday* 's @entity149 loss
