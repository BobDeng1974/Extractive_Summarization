five million retired workers could be given the right to sell their private sector pensions for cash under plans being considered by ministers			1
pensions minister @entity6 is pushing for landmark pension reforms in last year ’s budget to be extended to those who have already retired			1
under the changes announced by @entity12 last year , savers will no longer have to use their pensions to buy an annuity – a financial product that pays an annual income until a retiree dies			1
instead they will be able to cash in all or part of their savings for immediate use			2
pensions minister @entity6 wants to let people who have already retired cash in their annuities for a lump sum but the changes do not currently apply to existing pensioners , meaning those who have already bought an annuity will miss out on the new freedoms			1
the plans do not affect the state pension			1
yesterday mr @entity6 , a @entity32 who has been the architect of many of the @entity35 ’s pensions reforms , said : ‘ i want to see people trusted with their own money wherever possible			1
i have already heard from people around the country who would like to see this change made			1
‘ i want to see if we can get these freedoms extended to those who are receiving an annuity , but who might prefer a cash lump sum			0
‘ no one would be obliged to do so , but for those who would prefer up - front capital to regular income , i can see no reason why this should not be an option			0
’ under the latest plans , pensioners would be able to sell their annuities to the highest bidder , potentially unlocking tens of thousands of pounds			1
mr @entity6 said there was ‘ considerable interest and enthusiasm ’ within the pensions industry for the idea			1
the change is unlikely to be put in place before the election			0
mr @entity6 said he is currently seeking cross-party agreement to get the plan implemented in the next parliament			1
critics say many annuities offer poor value for money , with pensioners offered miserly rates in return for their life savings			2
pensions experts last night gave the proposal a mixed reception			2
' i want to see people trusted with their own money wherever possible , ' said pension minister @entity6 @entity83 , an adviser to government on older workers , said the scheme was potentially ‘ workable ’			1
but she warned it would need a ‘ radical change of mindset ’ , and said pensioners would have to be wary of potentially high charges when cashing in investments			0
@entity93 , head of pensions research at @entity95 , said the proposal was ‘ not a bad idea in principle ’ , but added there were major practical difficulties , especially for those who decided they still want to buy annuities			2
he said : ‘ the principle of allowing people to take back control over their own money is fine and consistent with the government ’s other reforms			1
‘ but it takes two to tango , and even where you have a customer who wants to cash in , they still have to find an insurance company who is willing to offer them a good deal			0
‘ the one thing that insurance companies will not want is all the sick and ill people taking out their money , because they effectively subsidise the people who live longer			1
‘ so you could well be in a situation where people would have to undergo an individual underwriting process			2
it could be pretty challenging			0
’ the latest figures from the pensions industry suggest there are about six million active annuities in the @entity132 paying out a combined total of £ 11billion a year			2
but some people have more than one pension , and the @entity136 estimates that about five million people in total are in receipt of annuity payments			1
loyal savers are receiving the worst interest rates since records began , figures show			0
rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years , with customers now getting an average of just 1.8 per cent on fixed - term savings accounts			0
despite being among the worst - paying accounts in @entity132 , these have names such as @entity154 ’s ‘ @entity153 ’ – offering just 0.05 per cent – and @entity156 ’s ‘ @entity155 ’ which has a 0.1 per cent rate			0
the elderly have been particularly affected by plummeting savings rates , as many rely on the interest on a nest egg to boost their pension income			2
the @entity164 said the record low applied to accounts where you can not withdraw your savings before a set date			0
but accounts which allow easier access to cash are also paying near - record lows , at just 0.76 per cent on average			0
the @entity164 ’s base rate has been set at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 , which has dragged down savings rates			0
in addition , the government ’s @entity178 for lending scheme allowed banks to borrow £ 80billion cheaply from the @entity164 , meaning they no longer needed savers to fund loans			0
@entity185 , of @entity186 , said many pensioners ‘ have saved all their lives hoping to reap the rewards now , but they are not ’ .			0

new plans could see millions of retired workers given right to sell pension
the changes are being *floated* by @entity32 pensions minister @entity6
he says he wants to ' trust people with their own money wherever possible '
mr @entity6 said that he would like to launch a *public* *consultation* on issue
