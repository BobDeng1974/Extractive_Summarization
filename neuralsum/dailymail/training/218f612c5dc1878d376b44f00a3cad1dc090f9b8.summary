' i was out with my kids and struggled to get out before the lights came on and people saw			0

i could no longer deny how big i 'd become			2
' since i 've lost the weight i feel so much better , but i still keep my old jeans to remind me never to go back			1
' @entity9 had always been big , never having been below a size 16 , but gained more weight as she got older and had children			1
at her biggest she was wearing a size 20 , and claims even that was a squeeze			2
@entity9 pictured at the @entity43 around the time of the humiliating cinema incident she said : ' everything was a challenge when i was overweight - i could n't walk anywhere or do stuff with my kids			1
' i 'd diet for a week , but then reward myself with a takeaway if i lost half a pound			0
' getting stuck in the cinema made me realise how bad i was - i was the real life @entity2			1
' i panicked - it 's the same feeling as when you get a ring stuck on your finger , but much more embarrassing			2

she has now been at her target weight for over a year but admits that chocolate is her weakness			2

' my friend dragged me along and now i never miss a class			0
it 's not at all like i expected , we 're like a family			0
' for @entity9 the class really was family , as her brother @entity93 , 33 , joined and lost eight and a half stone himself			1
@entity9 said : ' i got him into it , but he carried on and did the hard work himself			2
