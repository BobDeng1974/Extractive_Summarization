it foundered at its moorings only two days after the 70th anniversary of the @entity3 landings ' she has played her part in history and deserves a happy ending - not rotting at the bottom of a river			2
' the boat is an important piece of @entity61 military and naval history and should not be allowed to just sink without trace			0
but it ’s proved impossible to raise her			0
' the @entity21 experts , based at @entity66 on the @entity67 , were using special buoyancy bags in an attempt to lift the vessel			1
mr @entity26 said : ' we do n’t know what ’s going to happen now			2

after the war , the vessel changed hands several times , moving gradually north before settling on @entity106			0
historic : @entity10 was among the smallest of the ' little ships ' flotilla from 1940 which responded to the urgent call from @entity79 to rescue the @entity7 forces @entity3 : troops wade out to ships waiting to rescue them off the beaches of @entity3 in 1940 @entity117 ’s @entity116 bought the boat in 1972 and began operating it as a pleasure cruiser on the loch			1
the @entity10 played a central role in annual ceremonies of the @entity124 and @entity17 branch of the @entity126			2
but it foundered at its moorings and became submerged in 2010 - only two days after the 70th anniversary of the evacuation			2
before the rescue operation began , mr @entity26 said : ' i was on the point of giving up and having her broken up because i could n’t get any help in saving her			1
' we put her on @entity138 for £ 1 to no avail			0
after that , @entity140 of the famous teacake company rang and offered to help us			0
' luckily we ’ve been donated the air bags and the @entity21 have volunteered their services free , so we have n’t yet needed mr @entity140 ’s help			2
' hailed by @entity79 as a ' miracle of deliverance ' , the evacuation of @entity7 soldiers from the beaches and harbour of @entity3 is one of the best - known episodes of the @entity153			0

the mission , codenamed @entity3 , incurred significant losses , however , and @entity79 warned afterwards : ' wars are not won by evacuations '			0
the @entity61 premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the @entity7 operations in @entity175 prior to the evacuation had been a ' colossal military disaster '			0
