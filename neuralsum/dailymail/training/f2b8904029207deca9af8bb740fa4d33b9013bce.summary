by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 30 september 2013 @entity1 is dead ? noooo ! say it is not so			1
not the dashing and dishy lawyer , hero of the @entity1 novels and the @entity8 films that followed ? he was the ultimate knight in shining armour — well , a cashmere coat and white shirt at least — the devoted hunk who rescues calamitous @entity1 from myriad scrapes and japes , but most of all from herself			1
surely he can not be dead and gone , ceased to be , expired and gone to meet his maker ? @entity17 even in that jumper : @entity19 as @entity1 well , i am afraid so			1
in @entity24 , the brand new volume of @entity1 ’s fictional diaries , author @entity21 reveals the terrible news			1
she has killed off her hero , stabbed him right between the pages without a second thought			0
after all those years , after the regrettable but gluttonous consumption of too many calories , alcohol units and toxic bachelors , there was almost a happy ending for @entity1			1
following @entity1 ’s proposal at the end of the last book , @entity36 , we learn that the couple did go on to marry and have two children			1
@entity43 has met his maker			0
extracts published in a sunday newspaper reveal that @entity24 begins five years after @entity1 has died			1
we are reintroduced to @entity1 as a 51 - year - old widow ( ‘ 35 if anyone asks ’ ) , a mother to little @entity50 and nit - infested @entity51			1
surprisingly , she appears to have overcome the mortal blow of her husband ’s death — on the surface , at least			1
@entity1 - @entity36 from 2004 : @entity56 with @entity57 , left , as ' the despicable @entity58 ' and @entity19 who plays @entity1 the contemporary @entity1 is a foxy yummy mummy , immersed in an affair with a 29 - year - old toyboy called @entity62			1
in one passage , @entity1 gets lost in a moment of private reverie , recalling things she and @entity62 did in the bathroom when her kids were asleep			1
i ’m not giving anything away here when i reveal that it was n’t synchronised tooth flossing			0
more alarmingly , the new @entity1 is also obsessed with social media , more likely to be found counting @entity75 followers than calories			1
how apt then that appalled @entity1 fans took to @entity75 in their thousands over the weekend , tweeting in uproar when the demise of @entity1 was revealed in @entity81			2
their responses sparked across cyberspace like angry firecrackers			0
‘ i refuse to believe it ’			0
‘ my whole world has just fallen apart			0
why , @entity21 ? why ? ? ? ’ ‘ @entity1 is dead			2
@entity1 is a widow ! ! this is all too much ! ’ these were just some of the reactions as the news clattered across the world			2
it led tv news bulletins , it was discussed on chat boards , it landed with a crash on newspaper websites			0
readers and fans wo n’t know the cause of @entity1 ’s death , apparently buried deep in a flashback many chapters later , until the book is published next month			1
until then , those who have become so upset by the news that the non-existent husband of a fictional character has been killed off will somehow have to contain their grief			0
why should the death of @entity1 cause such a reaction ? to understand , we have to turn the clock back to remember the crazy days when @entity1 first burst onto the scene , an everywoman for single girls ; the patron saint of drunken wallflowers whose careers were going nowhere fast			1
back in the mid-nineties — shatteringly , it seems just like yesterday — @entity21 ’s newspaper column @entity121 first charted the life of a 30 - something singleton trying to make her way in @entity126			2
@entity1 quickly became one of the most beloved characters in modern literature			2
with every unit of alcohol and cigarette consumed , @entity130 practically invented chick lit. no one before or since did it so well or so wittily			0
in @entity24 , the brand new volume of @entity1 's fictional diaries , author @entity21 reveals the terrible news ... the first book came out in 1996 and went on to become a smash , eventually voted one of the top ten novels that defined the 20th century — along with 1984 by @entity143 and @entity144			1
published in 40 countries , it sold more than 15 million copies worldwide , and spawned a best - selling sequel , @entity1 : the @entity149			1
the two books were each turned into major films starring @entity56 as @entity1 , @entity19 as @entity1 and @entity57 as the despicable @entity58			2
@entity1 ’s appeal stretched across continents ; her singular , hilarious voice was a comfort to the lonely and the lovelorn			1
and her relationship with @entity1 really mattered — it was the beating heart of the story			2
after all , he was the ultimate chick - lit romantic hero ; tall , dark - haired , handsome , rich , clever , kindly and divorced by a @entity159 , who left him emotionally bruised and unable to @entity160			0
only carefree , silly @entity1 could make him happy again — and it was thrilling when he finally proposed			2
for millions of readers , if the world ’s most famously socially dysfunctional singleton could find happiness at the end of the rainbow of dating and disasters , there was hope for us all			1
and now this ? no wonder they are so upset			0
of course , author @entity21 has always claimed that her character @entity1 is not autobiographical			2
however , it is telling that @entity130 wrote the first books when she was a singleton herself			0
and now , just like @entity1 , she is a single mother of two			2
there are other worrying signs			0
in the new book , @entity1 still seems to be bumbling around in a disorganised mess , like a teen who wo n’t tidy her bedroom or her thoughts			1
despite bereavement and motherhood , nothing fundamental seems to have changed in the pulsing , boy - mad walnut of her brain			0
she is obsessed with her toy - boy lover and with texting and tweeting			0
she admonishes herself for ‘ lying in bed thinking erotic thoughts ’ and wanting to give the other mothers ‘ the v sign ’ at the school gates			0
oh , stop it ! she also obsesses about ageing , as do the characters around her			0
this is supposed to be the voice of a middle - aged widow and mother of two ? most women , i think , would accept that they are not the same person they were at 30 as they are at 50			0
life has a way of buffering emotions , smoothing out some , sharpening others			0
what was so important 20 years ago seems almost irrelevant now			0
terrific : @entity1 was self - obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people			1
it captured what it was like to be young , free and single , trying to make your mark on the world that was what was so terrific about the younger @entity1			2
she was self - obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people			0
it captured what it was like to be young , free and single , trying to make your mark on the world			0
yet surely one has to move on ? from the glimpses we have seen so far , @entity1 is a cheese who has plunged through the maturation process without touching the sides			2
she is still a ditz who can not work the remote control of her television or stop herself from eating three big @entity241 a week , she continues to blunder around as if she fell out of @entity242 half an hour ago			0
emotionally , mentally and physically , @entity1 has failed to move on			2
today , she is an analogue woman in a digital age , struggling to keep up with the kids			0
she is growing old disgracefully — should we cheer or weep ? @entity130 ’s publishers have said that the new book would ‘ give a voice to the more mature social media - obsessed concerns of the women who grew up with @entity1 ’			1
well , it might be true for a smattering of @entity126 yum - mums , but i wonder how much resonance it will have elsewhere ? can we even be bothered with her angst any more ? perhaps in some respects , @entity1 had to die			1
in so many ways , he was like @entity1 ’s parent ; always getting her out of trouble , kissing it better , giving her advice and loving her unconditionally			1
if @entity1 was there , he would be telling her to grow up			0
and if she grew up , she would n’t be @entity1 .			1

at the end of the last book , @entity36 , we learn that the couple did go on to marry and have two children
the contemporary @entity1 is a foxy yummy mummy , immersed in an affair with a 29 - year - old toyboy
readers wo n’t know the cause of @entity1 ’s death , apparently buried in flashback , until the new book is published next month
