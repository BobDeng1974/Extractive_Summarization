the @entity0 would not be fought today , according to @entity1 , because the younger generation are more concerned with their iphones than any sense of ‘ duty ’			1
the @entity8 host and historian said modern society is too ‘ self - obsessed ’ and ‘ hedonistic ’			2
speaking at a literature festival in @entity12 , he said the idea of ‘ duty ’ had now diminished in favour of ‘ personal freedom ’ , adding : ‘ what would [ the younger ] generation fight for ? the right to use your @entity20 ? what are the great noble causes ? ’ @entity1 believes a conflict like the @entity0 would not happen today because society is too ' self - obsessed ' and ' hedonistic ' he added : ‘ ideas of duty , clearly strongly felt by many people , have diminished as the international significance of the country has diminished			1
‘ we live in such a relativistic society now , and materialist , self - obsessed and hedonistic ; it ’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would say that “ it is worth it , i am willing to risk my life and well - being for this			2
” ’ mr @entity1 , 63 , said he had ‘ no doubt whatsoever ’ that the war would not be fought today but that in his opinion , ‘ some things are worth fighting for			1
’ @entity1 also claims that a conflict like the @entity0 would not happen because of the persuasive presence of social media , which he claims has changed what people are willing to put up with ' over the top ' during the @entity50			1
@entity1 believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight ‘ we have grown up in an environment in which the greatest premium is put on personal freedom , ’ he said			1
‘ great value , we are told living in a western democracy , is that you can do as you please			0
‘ it ’s a much more difficult challenge to manage that sort of society than the generation that grew up during the @entity0			1
’ he said today ’s influence of social media would also hinder any war effort as it has changed what ‘ people are prepared to put up with ’ , adding : ‘ i suspect that there would have been so many tweets ... and photos of trench digging that public opinion would have caused an end to the business			2
the trench would never be dug			0
’ he also argued that there was a great misunderstanding in the way the @entity0 was viewed , partly as a result of war poetry such as that by @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity1 hopes his new show ' @entity90 's @entity0 ' will change the perception of how much of an impact the conflict had on the @entity94 , but says he is naive to think he could do it alone he told the @entity96 : ‘ forget the poems , forget @entity98 , forget @entity99			1
engage with the lives of those who took part in it and think , “ what would i have done ? ” ‘ the events now are so built upon by writers and attitudes and propaganda that the actual events seem submerged			0
@entity110 host mr @entity1 is currently presenting the @entity112 series @entity90 ’s @entity0 , and accompaniment to his book @entity90 ’s @entity0 ’ , which looks at the impact the 1914 - 1918 conflict had on the country			1
@entity118 started a political row when he argued that contrary to the views of academics , the conflict was a ' just war ' to combat aggression by a @entity126 elite bent on domination he said he hopes to be able to change perceptions but admits he would be a ‘ fool ’ if he thought he could do so alone			1
he added : ‘ so what i wanted to do was re-engage with the events themselves			0
how did they seem to people at the time ? he said that a ‘ difficulty ’ of modern education is that so much of what we know about the @entity0 is taught only as poetry and not history			2
‘ i think the reason [ poetry ] is of interest is that it confirms with your prejudices to see the whole thing as a terrible , pointless sacrifice , sure , and the story it was fought for democracy and so on i do n’t think it stacks up			0
‘ but i think that the idea that the whole thing was a conspiracy to throw away young lives is perpetuated by the poets and actually there is much more to it than that			0
in january , education secretary @entity118 started a political row when he said television shows like @entity99 peddled ‘ left - wing myths ’ that the @entity0 was a ‘ misbegotten shambles ’			2
he argued that contrary to the views of left - wing academics , the conflict was a ‘ just war ’ to combat aggression by a @entity126 elite bent on domination			0
he said : ‘ the war was , of course , an unspeakable tragedy , which robbed this nation of our bravest and best			0
‘ but it ’s important that we do n’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict in the last 70 or so years			0
‘ the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity98 , @entity180 and @entity99 as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out - of - touch elite			0

@entity1 does *n't* believe conflict like the @entity0 would happen today
he thinks that the @entity94 culture these days is too ' hedonistic '
he also believes that the younger generation have little to fight for
@entity1 is currently hosting a @entity112 show ' @entity90 's @entity0 '
he hopes to change the perception of the conflict using his show
