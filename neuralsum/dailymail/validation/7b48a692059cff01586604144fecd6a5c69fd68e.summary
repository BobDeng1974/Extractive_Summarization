@entity0 , 28 , sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the @entity3 days a jeweller who sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the @entity3 days on @entity6 has been spared jail			1

she advertised 129 items containing derivatives of tiger from november 2012 to june 2014 and during that time her business had a turnover of £ 17,360 , the court heard			1
@entity0 claimed the jewellery pre-dated 1947 regulations banning the sale of tiger derivatives as the items were classed as ' antique ' because they were more than 50 years old			1
but scientific officers who examined photos of the jewellery said the items had not been significantly altered from their natural state and so were not exempt of the regulations			0
they said it was also impossible to tell purely by looking at the teeth or claws whether they were tiger or another creature and that could only be done by radio carbon dating			1
prosecutor @entity57 said : ' she did not make reasonable inquiries as to the provenance of the items she was selling or make inquiries as to the law on the trade of endangered species			0
' @entity0 accepted she had not made detailed inquiries to verify the origin of the pieces and 90 per cent were already in settings when she bought them , the vast majority from antique markets			2
she believed the items she sold were exempted from the regulations			0

what she did n't do was read the guidance			0
' judge @entity104 ordered the forfeiture and destruction of all the jewellery seized			2
he said : ' you are fundamentally a good person			0
this is not a case of fraudulent or dishonest selling of items derived from endangered species if it had been the sentence would have been immediate custody and substantial			0
' ' anybody selling jewellery based on endangered species needs to check the precise law			2
' speaking after the hearing @entity0 said : ' i feel the investigators should be going after the real villains and not people like me			2
' they could stop people trading on @entity6 in endangered species derivatives tomorrow if the site complied			2
