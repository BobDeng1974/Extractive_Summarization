by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:08 est , 27 november 2013 @entity3 : 19:42 est , 27 november 2013 a judge has said the rights of two @entity7 b&b owners to bar a gay couple from sharing a room were outweighed by the need to correct ‘ centuries of discrimination ’ against gay people			1
the @entity14 yesterday rejected the claim by @entity16 and @entity17 that they acted within the law when they refused a room to @entity20 and @entity21 because they were not a heterosexual married couple			1
the decision ends a five - year legal battle that began when mr @entity20 and mr @entity21 , backed by the government ’s @entity25 , took the @entity27 to court under equality laws			1
@entity30 , 74 , and his wife @entity29 , 69 , the @entity7 owners of a guesthouse , lost their @entity14 case @entity34 , deputy president of the @entity14 , dismissed the @entity27 ’ appeal to the country ’s highest court , saying that discrimination against homosexuals was ‘ an affront to their dignity as human beings ’			1
she added that hundreds of years of persecution of gays had led @entity47 human rights judges in @entity48 to require strong reasons to justify discrimination against them			2
‘ it is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion , ’ @entity34 said			2
it follows a series of cases in which judges in @entity65 and @entity48 have found against @entity7 who dissented from gay rights laws			2
among those who lost were @entity68 , a registrar in @entity70 who wanted to avoid presiding at civil partnership ceremonies , and @entity72 , a @entity74 counsellor sacked after he was questioned by his employers over his attitude to gay rights following a statement that he would not give sex therapy to a gay couple			1
the guesthouse owners refused to let @entity20 ( left ) and @entity82 stay in a double room the @entity27 were taken to court after they turned mr @entity21 and mr @entity20 away from their @entity85 , in @entity86 , @entity87 , in september 2008			1
the @entity14 judges have upheld an earlier ruling that the @entity27 , whose lawyers were paid for by the @entity68 think tank , must pay £ 3,600 in compensation to mr @entity21 and mr @entity20			1
mrs @entity27 said yesterday : ‘ we are deeply disappointed and saddened by the outcome			0
we are just ordinary @entity7 who believe in the importance of marriage as the union of one man and one woman			2
our b&b is not just our business , it ’s our home			0
‘ these beliefs are not based on hostility to anyone			0
we certainly bear no ill - will to @entity20 and @entity21			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity105 ought to be a country of freedom and tolerance , but it seems religious beliefs must play second fiddle to the new orthodoxy of political correctness			0
dismissing the appeal , @entity34 , deputy president of the @entity14 , said : ' sexual orientation is a core component of a person 's identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation			1
' homosexuals ' were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others ' , she said , adding : ' this was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now ( some would say belatedly ) recognised			2
' homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others			0
but we should not under - estimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination , persecution even , which is still going on in many parts of the world			2
' it is no doubt for that reason that @entity48 requires " very weighty reasons " to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation			0
' it is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel - keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion			1
' if mr @entity20 and mr @entity21 ran a hotel which denied a double room to @entity20 and mrs bull , whether on the grounds of their @entity7 beliefs or on the grounds of their sexual orientation , they would find themselves in the same situation that @entity20 and mrs bull find themselves today			1
' we appealed to the @entity14 to introduce a bit more balance when dealing with competing rights of sexual orientation and religious liberty			1
' somehow , we have got to find a way of allowing different beliefs to coexist in our society			0
' but the judges have sidestepped that big issue , and reinforced the notion that gay rights must trump everything else			0
' in particular , we are deeply troubled by the remarks of @entity34 , who says rulings by @entity47 judges means gay rights are almost untouchable			0
' what does this mean for other people in @entity105 who believe in traditional marriage - not just @entity7 , but @entity193 , jews , people of all faiths and none ? ' we ask @entity197 to take a serious look at how @entity7 with traditional beliefs are being left out in the cold			1
' we have no regrets about contesting this case , nor will we ever be ashamed of our beliefs			0
' we are not perfect people , but we are trying to do our best to live out our faith with honesty and consistency			0
and we will continue to do that , come what may			0
' the @entity27 had accepted an £ 80 - a - night double room booking , believing @entity20 , 38 , would be staying with his wife			1
but when mr @entity20 arrived with his 46 - year - old civil partner @entity21 , the men , from @entity214 , were told they would not be able to share one room and instead had to sleep separately			1
the @entity27 denied that they had discriminated against the couple , arguing that their policy of only allowing married couples to sleep in a double bed , in accordance with their religious beliefs , was applied to everyone , regardless of sexual orientation			1
they said they had also prevented unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened 25 years ago			0
mr @entity21 and mr @entity20 said they were victims of discrimination			1
the @entity27 have since been forced to close the b&b in september because their falling income no longer covered the mortgage on the business they had nurtured over three decades			0
they suffered a drop in bookings following the controversy , which led to negative reviews online , their website being hacked , property vandalised and receiving death threats			0
the @entity27 said they thought that any sex outside marriage was ' a sin ' - and denied discriminating against mr @entity21 and mr @entity20 @entity68 spokesman @entity243 said : ' what this case shows is that the powers of political correctness have reached all the way to the top of the judicial tree			1
so much so that even the @entity14 dare not say anything against gay rights			2
' writing the main opinion in the ruling , @entity34 effectively said gay rights are almost untouchable because of the rulings by @entity47 judges			0
' combine that with gay marriage , and it 's a recipe for all sorts of threats to people who believe in traditional marriage			2
' this ruling is another slap in the face to @entity7 , and shows that the elite institutions are saturated with a liberal mindset which cares little about religious freedom			0
' it should be noted that the one - sided laws which paved the way for this case , the @entity269 2007 , were voted for by the now prime minister @entity273			2
' @entity197 needs to reform the law to allow a more reasonable approach which balances competing rights			0
otherwise , @entity277 will become the belief that dare not speak its name			0

guesthouse owners @entity30 , 74 , and his wife @entity29 , 69 , turned away @entity21 and his civil partner @entity20
bulls said they thought that any sex outside marriage was ' a sin ' - and denied discriminating against mr @entity21 and mr @entity20
couple had *previously* lost fights in @entity292 and the @entity293
now five @entity14 justices have ruled against them
