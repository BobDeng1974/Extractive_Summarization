@entity0 has hailed his former @entity2 team - mate @entity1 ahead of monday 's @entity3 ceremony - lauding the @entity4 forward as the ' best player on the planet '			1
@entity7 defender @entity0 selected @entity1 in his @entity10 @entity9 @entity8 for 2015 - alongside the @entity13 forward 's @entity4 team - mate @entity11 and arch - rival @entity14 in a potentially - lethal front three			1
@entity1 will go up against @entity16 's @entity14 and @entity18 's @entity17 - who gets the goalkeeping spot in @entity0 's side - for the @entity3 on monday , with the @entity21 forward a heavy favourite to claim his second successive award , and the third of his career			1
@entity1 is the ' best player on the planet ' and should win the @entity3 , says @entity0 @entity0 's @entity10 @entity27 included @entity1 , @entity14 and @entity11 up front @entity0 also selected @entity2 's @entity28 and @entity30 's @entity29 @entity14 ( right ) also features in @entity0 's team of the year and is one of the @entity3 contenders @entity14 ( left ) and @entity1 will go up against one another for the @entity3 on monday night and former @entity2 centre back @entity0 believes @entity1 fully deserves the accolade after enjoying a 2014 which ' set him apart ' from @entity14			1
@entity0 - who recently joined an @entity10 @entity9 15 panel to debate his @entity8 alongside @entity7 team - mate @entity39 , @entity41 striker @entity40 and @entity42 right back @entity37 - said of @entity1 : ' he ’s the best player on the planet			1
' @entity44 or @entity14 ( should win the @entity3 ) , as they are the best players in the world			1
@entity14 was fantastic last year but @entity1 i think nicked it ; he played particularly well scoring lots of goals last year as well			2
' he scored more than @entity14 last year i think , and he won the @entity51 and that sets him apart			2
' ( @entity14 is just ) just a magician , a genius			0
someone of his height and physical capability , he should n’t be doing what he ’s doing but he ’s breaking all the records			0
' you need a couple of you ( to defend against him ) ! but even then , he finds a way			0
' the other day he scored a goal , he nutmegged someone and just passed it into the back of the net and that ’s the difference between him and @entity1			0
@entity1 is more pace and power , both feet , scores every type of goal , whereas @entity14 passes the ball into the net and @entity1 more forces the ball into the back of the net a lot of the time			2
' @entity0 smiles as he sits around the @entity77 debating his team of the year @entity0 ( right ) and @entity1 lift the @entity80 trophy in 2007 during their time at @entity2 @entity1 ( right ) celebrates with @entity83 after scoring in the 2014 @entity51 final @entity1 arrived at @entity85 in 2003 and played with @entity0 for six years before departing for the @entity86 in 2009			1
as soon as @entity1 arrived in the @entity87 , @entity0 explains that he knew the now 29 - year - old would go on to dominate world football one day			2
he continued : ' you could see from the moment that he came in the door at @entity2 that he was going to be a top player , how far he was going to go you never knew , but for me that ’s what i appreciate more about him than anything is that he has made himself a top player in the world			2
@entity4 forward @entity1 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity30 's @entity101 ( from left ) @entity40 , @entity0 , @entity37 and @entity39 debate their teams of the year ' he could have been a great player , but he ’s gone on to be the best player in the world , and right now he is that			1
that is through sheer desire and determination and through ability			0
' and on the right ( of my team ) , is @entity11 who potentially could take over these two ( @entity1 and @entity14 as the best player in the world ) , as he started younger , he ’s fresher			1
he could be the one who comes on and takes that mantle of being the best player in the world			0
' interestingly , @entity0 places @entity118 alongside @entity1 as the best players he has ever played alongside			2
' @entity118 is the most natural footballer i have played with in that he could finish football ; he actually retired and then came back and was still the best player in training after eight months or whatever it was that he did n’t play			0
' @entity11 makes @entity0 's side and could take the ' mantle of being the best player in the world ' @entity118 , pictured in april 2008 , is the best player @entity0 has played with , alongside @entity1 in terms of @entity0 's team of the year itself , his side is anchored by @entity17 in goal and would play in a 4 - 3 - 3 formation			1
speaking about @entity134 @entity133 winner @entity17 , who is looking to become the first goalkeeper to win the @entity3 , the 36 - year - old said : ' i think he is the best keeper on the planet and he ’s not a traditional goalkeeper just staying on his line , he comes out and cleans up behind the back line			1
' protecting @entity17 's goal is a back four of @entity143 @entity133 - winning captain @entity142 at right back , @entity18 's @entity144 at left back , plus @entity29 from @entity30 and @entity4 's @entity145 , who @entity0 labels as ' potentially the best centre half in the world ' because he is ' quick , strong , ( has ) anticipation , calm , ( is ) decent on the ball and won the @entity51 '			2
@entity0 's midfield would be made up of @entity18 midfielder @entity153 , @entity4 's @entity154 and @entity2 winger @entity28			1
@entity17 is also up for the @entity3 and makes @entity0 's side as the goalkeeper when explaining his midfield picks , @entity0 added : ' three man midfield			1
at the base is @entity153 to dictate the pace of the game			0
great technician , great passer and great tactical awareness			0
' @entity154 is another great passer of the ball , pops up with a goal here and there as well and i think that he is a fantastic player that is going to go on and probably dominate midfields for a long time			0
@entity133 winner as well so he had to be in there			0
' left side of the three is @entity28			2
last year at @entity4 he was arguably their best player			0
he ’s great at getting the ball at one end of the pitch and dragging the team up to the other end of the pitch and causing havoc			0
' you do n’t get many midfielders who can turn defence into attack the way that he does on the ball , committing players			0
' @entity28 ( right ) , pictured against @entity191 's @entity190 , features in @entity0 's midfield @entity10 has teamed up @entity0 , @entity37 , @entity39 and the strongest player in @entity9 15 , @entity40 , to have their say on who should make this year ’s @entity8 for @entity9			1

@entity0 has selected his @entity10 @entity199 for 2015
@entity1 , @entity14 and @entity11 make up the front three
@entity1 is ' the best player on the planet ' and should win the @entity3 after a *magnificent* 2014 that ' set him apart ' from the rest , says @entity0
@entity17 and @entity14 , @entity3 contenders , make @entity0 's side
@entity2 's @entity28 is also in @entity0 's @entity197
