when some of the world 's first aviation pioneers tried to reach the skies centuries ago , they inflated hot air balloons			0
and now @entity6 are looking into inflatable technology once more , this time as a way of reaching the next frontier in human space travel - @entity10			1
scientists are considering using a blow - up heat shield , which resembles stacking ring of doughnuts that young children play with , for future missions to the red planet			1
scientists are considering using an inflatable heat shield , which resembles stacking ring of doughnuts that young children play with , for future missions to @entity10 an inflatable heat shield , such as the one pictured , could help a future spacecraft slow down enough to enter @entity10 ' atmosphere @entity6 engineers believe a lightweight , inflatable heat shield could be deployed to slow the craft to enter a @entity10 atmosphere , which is much thinner than @entity31 's			1
such an inflatable heat shield could help a spacecraft reach the high - altitude southern plains of @entity10 and other areas that would otherwise be inaccessible under existing technology			1
the experts say rockets alone ca n't be used to land a large craft on @entity10 , as can be done on the @entity40			2
parachutes also will not work for a large spacecraft needed to send humans to @entity10 , they add			1
the rings would be filled with nitrogen and covered with a thermal blanket			0
once deployed for landing , the rings would sit on top of the spacecraft , resembling a giant mushroom			0
@entity52 , @entity6 's senior engineer for advanced entry , descent and landing systems at their base in @entity57 , @entity58 , said : ' we try to not use propulsion if we do n't have to			0
we make use of that atmosphere as much as we can , because it means we do n't have to carry all that fuel with us			0
' the scientists now aim to test how inflatable spacecraft technology performs upon re-entry into @entity31 's atmosphere			1
once deployed for landing , the rings would sit on top of the spacecraft , resembling a giant mushroom the scientists now aim to test how inflatable spacecraft technology performs upon re-entry into @entity31 's atmosphere the test , scheduled for 2016 , is important because @entity6 officials believe the shield could help them land astronauts on @entity10 and return larger loads of supplies from the @entity80			1
new technology is needed because the type of spacecraft that would land humans on the red planet would be much larger than anything that has landed on the planet previously and current heat shield technology is too heavy			1
@entity6 engineers have been working on the inflatable technology for about a decade , and believe it is close to being ready for operational use			2
' if i had the budget and we had the funding to do it , i think we could get as large a scale as needed for humans in five to ten years , ' mr @entity52 said			0
new technology is needed because the type of spacecraft that would land humans on the red planet would be much larger than anything that has landed on the planet previously he said the same inflatable technology could also be used for spacecraft to explore other planets or objects with atmospheres , such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
because the inflatables are made of lightweight material and filled with nitrogen , more room is left aboard a spacecraft for science experiments and other things astronauts will need			0
the inflatable is covered by a thermal blanket of layers of heat - resistant materials			2
@entity124 , principal investigator for materials and structures for hypersonic re-entry at @entity57 , said : ' the idea is that you would have something that could be packed up , put in a very small volume and then deployed into a very large size			0
' he said in a statement in april : ' think airbag , something we could pack into compressed volume that will fit the size limits of a launch shroud , but allow for a much larger aeroshell			0

nasa plan to test inflatable technology in their *quest* to put *people* on @entity10
scientists believe a blow - up heat shield could be used on future spacecraft
shield resembles stacking ring of doughnuts that young children play with
new technology needed as parachutes and rockets can not be used to slow down large spacecraft when entering the @entity10 atmosphere
