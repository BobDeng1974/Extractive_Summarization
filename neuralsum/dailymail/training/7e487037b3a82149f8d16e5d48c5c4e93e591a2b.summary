when strange bits of clothing started turning up on their doorstep @entity0 and @entity1 were puzzled to say the least			2
later , as towel sets , baby clothes and a @entity9 sausage found their way on to their kitchen floor , the confusion deepened			0
when they then spotted half a pizza wedged in the cat flap the penny finally dropped â€“ their beloved pet moggy @entity17 had turned into a cat burglar			1
@entity17 has been known to steal from neighbours ' homes and gardens in @entity22 , @entity23 - much to the dismay of his owners eyes on the prize : @entity17 began by stealing food from neighbours ' bins before moving onto clothing and homeware the two - year - old tabby started bringing home food about a year ago , before raiding local gardens , washing lines and even venture into nearby houses in @entity23			1
he returns home to his embarassed owners , @entity0 and @entity1 , every morning with a stockpile of pants , bras , dusters and food			1
the cat has amassed such a huge pile of knickers from these moonlit raids his owners have red - @entity49 delivered letters to residents admitting they may have of some of their property			1
every morning @entity17 shows off his loot to his embarassed owners @entity1 and @entity56 who have had to deliver letters to neighbours explaining his naughty habit @entity0 , 26 , a graphic designer , said : ' he was perfectly well behaved up until the age of one , then he started to turn to a life of petty crime			1
' he first started bringing things in from the recycling bins when he was about one			1
at first it was just the odd thing - but over the last four months , he has really started to up his game			2
' initially it was dusters and dish cloths but this has now intensified to clothes , including bras , pants , t - shirts and jumpers			2
' we have even had a pair of washing - up gloves - each brought in on a separate night			0
he goes out in the evening and then returns quite late on or in the early hours			0
' he brings his stolen items in and then meows and meows to announce he is back so we will go and see what he has brought in			0
sometimes he will go out multiple times during one night			0
' @entity17 roams the streets of @entity22 every night looking for something to bring home			2
his owners believe the problem has developed because there is no wildlife in the area for the cat to chase after the couple are now trying to reunite the items with their owners after collecting a huge stash of @entity17 ' stolen goodies in a special cat swag bag			1
they delivered letters explaining his naughty habit , appealing to anyone who was missing items from their washing line to get in touch			1
mr @entity56 added : ' at first we thought it was funny			0
but as his stash grew and the items were getting bigger , we thought we needed to return them			0
@entity17 sneaks through neighbours ' catflaps and into their homes where he has his pick of clothes , food and homeware ' it is not as if they are high - value items , but they all belong to someone			1
. ' fortunately all our neighbours have been very good natured about it and think it is funny			0
at least now they know where to come if something disappears mysteriously			0
' the couple have started ignoring @entity17 when he arrives home from a night of looting in the hope he 'll soon drop the bad habit			1
' by ignoring him when he arrives and tries to wake us up , we hope he will stop doing it			0
' there are lots of other cats in the area which i guess means there is not much wildlife around to hunt			0
so @entity17 chooses to steal stuff instead to pass the time			2

@entity17 the cat started by taking food from bins but has moved on to stealing from *washling* lines and houses
breaks into homes through other people *'s* cat flaps
red - faced owners have delivered letters to explain bad habit and *account* for missing items
