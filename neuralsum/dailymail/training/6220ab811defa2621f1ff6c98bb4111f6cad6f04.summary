@entity1 veteran @entity0 called it a cauldron and @entity4 rated his experience as bizarre , but @entity7 @entity1 captain @entity6 wants his players to take on the stature of gladiators when they walk onto the first tee at @entity12			1
every individual handles the occasion differently , but what they will have to cope with , starting from friday , is the pressure which comes with the fevered atmosphere of the hugely anticipated clash against the @entity20			1
the walk to the first tee goes through a tunnel under a road , and @entity6 likened the players ' emergence on the other side to that of gladiators entering the arena			1
@entity7 captain @entity6 ( @entity33 ) , speaking to @entity31 , wants his players to walk out like ' gladiators ' @entity6 would prefer his players did not take golf buggies to the first tee at @entity12 @entity0 , in his ninth @entity1 , knows what that feels like			1
' i was nervous on the first tee at @entity40 ( his debut in 1997 ) and that was without the 3,000 seats at the first tee and all the hype , ' he said			0
' i would imagine for the rookies it 's going to be a bit of a shock			2
it 's a bit of an intimidating atmosphere , but nothing they ca n't handle			2
' it really gets you going and gets the juices flowing			0
it 's changed a lot , though			0
' it 's getting more and more like a cauldron - type atmosphere , an amphitheatre to get your round off			1
' nothing prepares you for the @entity1 and getting on the first tee there and the atmosphere			1
' i played with @entity68 in the singles in 1999 and he got the crowd to sing the national anthem			0
that was sort of the build - up to the atmosphere that there is now really around the first tee			2
' @entity0 , practicing at @entity12 , admits being nervous before making his 1997 @entity1 debut @entity7 's leading player @entity79 ( r ) listens to @entity80 during a practice round as the players stand on the first tee , in their eye - line will be a quote from the late , great @entity86 posted on the back of the 18th grandstand which reads : ' as a player and captain these are unforgettable moments when you are competing for your team - mates , your country and for the people of your continent			1
' @entity6 has tried to make the walk - and he would prefer his players to make their own way rather than be driven there - to the tee more aesthetically pleasant with some cosmetic dressing , but he does not expect it to lessen the impact when they are greeted by the crowd			1
' it was a grey , miserable tunnel for carts to go under ( but now ) we 've got flowers and , to be fair to @entity20 , half of it is red and half is blue , ' he said			0
' i 'm very keen on the players walking to the first tee rather than being taken there in a buggy , although some may choose to be so			2
' i think it 's important to walk to the tee and we want to bring it to life - a bit like gladiators walking into the arena as you walk up that hill coming out of the tunnel			1
' the crowd will get a glimpse of them from the huge stands that are there and from the hospitality ( area ) ; it should be an electric atmosphere			2
' the @entity7 team line up for their group photo before the start of the competition at the weekend wives and girlfriends of the @entity7 team arrive in @entity146 to support their men @entity4 has experienced pressure situations at both ends of the contest , having holed the winning putt in 2010 and hit the first shot in @entity153 two years ago			1
' i 'm a guy that certainly embraces high - pressure scenarios and tries to put them in perspective and realise that that 's why i practise and that 's why i should try to enjoy it , ' the @entity154 said			2
' not that those types of scenarios are easy to enjoy - they are very painful			0
' they 're very unusual because you crave them but when you 're actually there you kind of wish you were n't because it 's very hard and all you can think about is not messing up			0
' 2010 was the most nerve - wracking experience probably of my life			0
' i thought i would be nervous going into the delivery room four weeks ago ( for the birth of his first child ) but i do n't think i will ever be that tight and that nervous again in my life as that back nine against @entity177 in @entity178			0
' hitting the first tee shot at @entity153 a couple years ago was a very bizarre experience			0
@entity4 ( r ) has experienced the pressure of hitting the first and last balls at the @entity1 @entity183 take a walk around the @entity12 course during practice on tuesday ' i felt very calm and confident as i went to the first tee ; the noise was amazing and everyone 's excitement levels had peaked			1
' i remember putting the tee in the ground , the whole place going deathly silent and standing over the tee shot thinking to myself , ' this is just the most bizarre feeling i 've ever had in my life '			0
' i did n't put a very good swing on it , like my head was genuinely elsewhere taking in how surreal the moment and the environment was from sort of high noise levels to absolutely zero			0
the silence level was amazing			0
' the great thing about the @entity1 is it 's sunday - afternoon pressure from the first tee shot on friday morning			1

@entity7 take on @entity183 in the @entity1 at @entity12 *september* *26* - *28*
@entity6 wants his players to walk out ' like gladiators '
@entity0 admits the rookies will feel intimidated by atmosphere
