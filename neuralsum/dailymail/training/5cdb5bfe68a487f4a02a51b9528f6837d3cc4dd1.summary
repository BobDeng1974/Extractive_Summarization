exposed : a devastating report today reveals how mishandling of foreign criminals costs £ 1bn a year a devastating report today reveals the £ 1billion - a - year failure by successive governments to police @entity7 ’s borders and deport even the most dangerous foreign criminals			1
according to @entity11 ’s spending watchdog , foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked , commit new offences – then cheat removal on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete			1
incredibly , the @entity17 has lost track of 760 of the 4,200 foreign criminals who had been freed back on to our streets by the end of march 2014 pending their removal			1
it includes 58 ‘ high harm ’ individuals , a category that includes rapists , killers and drug dealers			0
the ’ appalling ’ annual cost to the taxpayer of each foreign criminal is £ 70,000 – or a total of between £ 770million and £ 1.04billion a year			2
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) launched an investigation to find out if improvements had been made since the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal , when 1,000 were released without being considered for deportation			1
it found : the 48 - page report found failings at every stage of the system			2
in theory , a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to more than 12 months for a crime in their homeland can be turned away at the border			1
yet the @entity17 is relying on a @entity52 system that is more than a decade out of date , often fails to work properly and is based on ad hoc information sharing agreements with other countries			0
attention : @entity58 , which holds exclusively foreign nationals			1
the report found one in six overseas inmates freed from jail has absconded and 151 inmates were freed without being considered for removal in 2006 , the @entity66 government declined to join up to a @entity68 - wide information sharing regime , known as the @entity70 , that would have given access to alerts on known criminals			1
it leaves @entity7 as one of only four countries out of 32 in the @entity77 that can not access the data			0
ministers are now planning to join later this year			0
@entity35 officials estimate as many as 1,400 of the 12,250 foreign offenders living in the @entity7 at the end of march 2014 could have been turned away , had their offending histories been known			1
police are also failing to take action when they stop a foreign national			2
there is a separate computer system , known as @entity89 , which the @entity7 does have access to – but can only be used when a suspect is already inside the @entity7 ’s borders			0
in only three out of every ten cases are officers bothering to use it			0
this means that inmates who had a criminal record at home – who could have been detained and deported , based on their offending history – were allowed to remain in the @entity7 , and potentially commit new crimes			1
the @entity35 estimates that simply carrying out proper checks could save the taxpayer £ 70million a year			2
jail : @entity106 in @entity107 , which holds only foreign inmates			1
each one costs the taxpayer £ 70,000 the shambles continues even after a foreign offender has been convicted and sent to prison			0
the @entity35 found a ‘ lack of urgency ’ in the system and poor information sharing			2
staff referring cases to the @entity17 to start the removals process have to ‘ send paper forms that are faxed ’ because the it systems are incompatible			0
similar bureaucracy is hindering the hunt for the 760 criminals who have absconded after being freed from jail , often pending an appeal against deportation on human rights grounds			1
officials are only allowed to request 250 individual checks to @entity132 for information on whether the criminals may have turned up elsewhere in the tax or benefits system			2
@entity137 , chairman of @entity11 ’s public accounts committee , said : ‘ i am astounded that the number of foreign nationals in prisons has increased to 10,649 since 2006 and that , of those released , 760 currently waiting to be deported have disappeared and around 150 are thought not to have been considered for deportation			1
‘ it ’s appalling that only 30 per cent of potential foreign national offenders in custody were searched on immigration databases to see if they had committed crimes overseas			1
‘ it beggars belief that the @entity17 and @entity150 are managing the removal of foreign national offenders without knowing basic costs and how best to target their resources			2
’ @entity156 mp @entity155 , a long - standing critic of the failure to deport foreign criminals , said the public would be ‘ staggered ’ by the revelations			1
he added : ‘ my view is that if you are a foreign national who commits a crime in the @entity7 , you should be caught , convicted and sentenced with your sentence served back in your own country at the expense of your fellow nationals			2
‘ if their countries wo n’t take them , then their embassies should be sent the bill			0
all such individuals should be banned from ever returning to our shores			0
’ despite its own leading role in the debacle , @entity66 attacked the government ’s record			0
@entity137 , chairman of @entity11 ’s public accounts committee , said the situation ' beggars belief ' @entity184 immigration minister @entity183 said : ‘ @entity185 made a commitment to reduce the number of foreign prisoners and to deport more of them , but yet again he has failed to deliver			1
’ the number of foreign criminals kicked out last year was 5,097 – an improvement on 2006 , but down from the high of 5,613 in 2008 - @entity194 and security minister @entity195 said : ‘ foreign nationals who fundamentally abuse our hospitality by committing crime should be in no doubt of our resolute approach in seeking their removal			1
‘ the countless appeals and re-appeals lodged by criminals attempting to cheat the system cost us all money and are an affront to @entity7 justice			0
that is why we are putting a stop to that abuse through the @entity214			0
‘ new powers came into force this week to cut the number of grounds on which criminals can appeal their deportation and to end the appeals conveyor belt in the courts			1
they will build on the measures we introduced in the summer which are already speeding up the deportation process			0
’ analysis : chaotic system that cost @entity228 her life today 's revelations raise chilling new questions about cases such as that of murdered 15 - year - old @entity235			2
@entity228 ’s suspected killer @entity236 – found hanged a week after the schoolgirl ’s body was discovered in the @entity239 last month – was able to waltz into the @entity7 despite having a conviction in @entity241 for murdering his wife			0
he then slipped through the net a second time when he was arrested by the @entity246 on suspicion of indecently assaulting a teenage girl in @entity248 in 2009			0
in total , he is believed to have walked in and out of the country more than 20 times without being stopped			0
tragedy : @entity254 ( left ) , the suspected killer of @entity235 ( right ) , had a previous murder conviction when the scandal first broke , @entity257 officials pointed the finger of blame at poor information sharing by our @entity263 neighbours			0
yet , according to the @entity35 , there is masses of information available on foreign criminals which @entity7 is simply not bothering to access			1
this includes the so - called @entity70 , which @entity66 opted not to join in 2006 – despite signing us up to a raft of other @entity263 justice initiatives			0
of the 32 members of the @entity77 , we are one of only four countries not to take part in a regime which offers alerts on known foreign criminals			1
which , in turn , raises the disturbing prospect that information was available that might have allowed @entity284 to be turned away at the border – but nobody bothered to request it			2
even accounting for @entity263 edicts on free movement , there would have been a powerful case for refusing him entry and preventing the horrors which followed			0
meanwhile , what of the @entity246 ’s failure to uncover @entity236 ’s past when he was arrested in 2009 – which would again have been sufficient grounds to boot him out			0
was @entity284 among the 70 per cent of cases where police do not even bother to do a search , when they apprehend a foreign national ? what is certain is that , eight years on from the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal , this country remains one of the most hospitable in @entity68 for the continent ’s worst criminals .			1

findings revealed today in report by @entity11 's @entity35
number of foreign prisoners has gone up by 4 per cent to 10,649
one in six abscond after leaving , despite **ten-fold** increase in case workers
1,400 foreign criminals are living here who should have been turned away
151 inmates were freed without even being considered for removal
staff in charge of deportation work are still using out - dated fax machines
