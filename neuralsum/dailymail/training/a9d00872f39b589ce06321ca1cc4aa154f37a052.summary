by @entity0 dreaded dimpling : even stars such as @entity3 suffer cellulite is the scourge of summer fashion			1
it forces us to wrap sarongs around swimsuits and wear nude tights under floaty dresses ( even on swelteringly hot days )			0
in short , anything to avoid putting puckered thighs and buttocks on display			0
nature has been particularly unkind when it comes to the distribution of cellulite , because while the dreaded dimpling can afflict even the slimmest of women - a staggering 95 per cent of us suffer from it - it rarely affects men			1
that 's because cellulite is n't really a fat problem ; it 's a skin problem - specifically , a female one			1
under the skin is a layer of fibrous connective tissue that binds it to the muscle			1
in men , this tissue criss - crosses beneath their slightly thicker skin in a regular pattern			1
in women , however , the strands of connective tissue run vertically , tethering the skin straight down at certain points , creating clearly defined fat chambers between them - essentially , peaks of fat and troughs of tissue			1
hey presto ! instead of nice , smooth skin , you 've got unattractive , lumpy , orange peel			1
however , not all women are cursed in quite the same way			0
here are ten surprising triggers that could be making your skin look even more mattress - like - and how you can fight back			1
forget the idea that a crash diet will rid you of these unsightly fat deposits - it will actually make them worse			1
first , if you ’re not eating enough protein this can cause water retention , seeing excess fluid filling up the chambers below the skin ’s surface just as fat does			1
second , repeated weight gain and weight loss compromise the skin ’s elasticity , making cellulite more pronounced still			1
fight it : nutrition experts recommend a diet high in healthy proteins ( fish , egg , seafood , white meat , beans , nuts and seeds ) with a little ' good ' carbohydrate ( whole grains , vegetables and fruit )			1
cut out processed carbs such as white bread			0
contrary to popular opinion , stress does not make you skinny - it produces the hormone cortisol , which encourages us to lay down fat around the stomach , hips , buttocks and thighs			1
as if this were n't enough , the fluctuations in female hormones associated with puberty , pregnancy and the menopause make our connective tissue less flexible , meaning it pulls down even harder against the bulging fat			1
fight it : cortisol causes cravings for sweet and / or high - fat foods , so quell cravings with natural ‘ good mood foods ’ such as berries and nuts - cashews are a good source of zinc , a lack of which has been linked to anxiety and depression			1
cigarette smoke has been shown to weaken and disrupt the formation of connective tissue meaning it is more easily damaged , again allowing fat to bulge beneath skin			2
it also compromises circulation , which encourages water retention and exacerbates cellulite			0
fight it : even e-cigarettes contain nicotine , which compromises blood flow , so if you want to really improve your skin health , you need to give up			1
some painkillers can case water retention which exacerbates cellulite again the problem here is with water retention , a side - effect of @entity149 ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) , the painkiller category that includes aspirin and ibuprofen			0
@entity154 drains from the body through the lymphatic system and empties back into the bloodstream			2
fluid retention happens when it is not fully removed from tissues			0
fight it : most people notice that water retention disappears when they discontinue the painkiller but check with your doctor			2
if appropriate you could try swapping to a paracetamol - based drug , which should n’t make you retain fluid			2
if your cellulite is particularly bad , sucking the excess fat out of your thighs might sound like an attractive ( if extreme ) answer , but , in fact , cosmetic surgeons warn liposuction frequently makes fat distribution more uneven , deepening the problem as it increases the peaks and troughs beneath your skin , accentuating cellulite			2
fight it : if you 're determined to get some help , non-invasive procedures such as @entity185 ( which uses vacuum suction and rollers to break up fat with deep massage ) and @entity191 ( which uses radio frequencies to smoothe skin ) have been shown to give better results against cellulite			1
sitting with your legs crossed for long periods interferes with circulation in the lower limbs by putting pressure on the main vein that runs along the inner thigh			0
this can cause fluid retention and make cellulite worse			1
fight it : bicycle pedalling is a great exercise to perform at your desk ( ignore the looks from your colleagues ! )			2
simply raise your legs and pedal as though you ’re on a bike for 30 seconds			0
aim to do a morning and an afternoon session			0
the word cellulite is derived from the @entity216 word ' la cellule ' which means cell just as sunshine ages skin , it can make cellulite worse			1
the sun 's rays trigger a reaction in which molecules called free radicals can weaken cells and connective tissue			0
sunburn can also cause water retention because the body responds by secreting toxins , which the kidneys must then work hard to excrete			0
if your kidneys become overloaded , this results in water being stored in the tissues of the body			0
fight it : use a high - factor @entity240 all over and re-apply twice daily ( most of us do n't apply enough - the average adult needs about 85ml , or just under half a bottle , to cover their whole body )			2
drink plenty of water ( it might sound counter-intuitive , but drinking water decreases water retention as it ensures the correct balance of salt and fluids in your body )			0
tone up : squat exercises can help running around the park may not make your cellulite worse , but it wo n't sculpt your bottom half , either , unless you include toning exercises			1
one study found adults who did three 30 - minute aerobic workouts a week for eight weeks lost 4lb but gained no muscle			0
when they coupled 15 minutes of aerobic activity with 15 minutes of toning exercises three times a week , however , they lost 10lb of fat and added 2lb of muscle			0
fight it : squats are one of the best leg and buttock - toning exercises			2
stand with your feet slightly wider than your hips and point your toes outward slightly			0
focusing on pushing your bottom backwards and downwards ( to keep your knees in line with your feet ) , squat down until your hip is lower than your knees			0
repeat until you ca n’t finish the exercise			0
ironically , while these are designed to iron out our lumpy , bumpy bits , wearing them regularly could well be making your cellulite more pronounced			0
that ’s because , if the compression of the garment in any way impedes blood flow or lymph drainage , then you will end up retaining water , making your cellulite noticeably worse			2
fight it : body wraps can temporarily banish water retention - but while your skin may look smoother for a week or so , it wo n’t get rid of cellulite altogether			1
if you suffer an allergic reaction your body releases chemicals called histamines , which increase fluid retention as white blood cells flood to the site of potential infection			2
in some cases this can be localised ( think of the swelling around an insect bite ) , but if the allergic reaction is more generalised ( for example a food intolerance ) then this can lead to water retention			0
fight it : if you think you might be bloated as the result of a food intolerance , a nutritional therapist can help you draw up a programme of food elimination to help work out what you are sensitive to .			0
