@entity0 has come a long way over the past six weeks but the final frontier remains tantalisingly out of reach			2
there have been three @entity6 titles and some courageous wins but beating one of the world 's very best players is still beyond him , as @entity11 showed in dismissing him from the quarter - finals of the @entity13 7 - 5 6 - 2			1
having competed on almost equal terms and even gone ahead in the second set , @entity0 completely unravelled without warning to lose 20 of the last 25 points and make it more likely that the @entity17 will hold off @entity19 's challenge for the world no 1 ranking this year			1
@entity11 had too much guile for @entity0 in the quarter - finals of the @entity13 @entity0 failed to beat his friend at the fourth time of asking this year , going down 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 @entity11 raises his hand in victory after a relatively straight forward victory over the @entity28 no 1 @entity0 had come into the tournament on the back of two successive singles titles in @entity32 and @entity33 @entity11 ( @entity34 ) @entity19 ( @entity35 ) @entity36 ( @entity35 ) @entity0 ( @entity28 ) @entity37 ( @entity38 ) @entity39 ( @entity40 ) @entity41 ( @entity42 ) @entity43 ( @entity44 ) while @entity0 's main objective of this week – confirming a place in the @entity48 in eight days ' time – was accomplished , @entity11 's personal superiority over him continues			1
he has now won all four of their meetings this year and seven out of the last eight , the 2013 @entity53 final now looking very much the exception to the rule			0
that is a concern , but in the immediate aftermath @entity0 could look at the post @entity61 period with pride before taking a well - earned breather this weekend			2
' the last six weeks have been fantastic , only positive , and will stand me in good stead , ' he said after suddenly sliding to a 101 - minute defeat			0
' @entity11 has played incredibly well these last three or four years			0
i was n't ready to play against the top few guys at the start of the year but i do n't feel my game is that far away from them now			0
' i was feeling okay tonight but i started rushing at the end , i can still take confidence from the last few weeks			0
' @entity0 had already secured his place at the @entity48 after beating @entity75 @entity76 argues a challenged line call by @entity0 in the first set @entity0 hasnot beaten @entity11 this year , despite overcoming him in the final of his two @entity80 wins the @entity17 is favourite to retain his world no 1 ranking at the end of the year the @entity28 no 1 reacts after losing his serve to see @entity11 take the first set 7 - 5 at the @entity89 event – the draw for which will take place on monday – you could see him beating anyone in the field but it looks a stretch against the world no 1			1
the impression is that @entity0 has to push all the way into the red line on the dial to compete with @entity11 right now , and he did that up until the unexpected denouement , when he collapsed from leading 2 - 1 with a break in the second			1
coming in on an eleven - match winning streak he often got the better of the longer rallies but his erratic first serve made life difficult throughout the first set , and he had to fend off five break points before succumbing to the sixth at 5 - 6			2
with @entity11 getting increasingly agitated after missing three early break points in the second @entity0 broke for 2 - 1 , only to concede his own serve straightaway			1
in fact it turned out to be the last game he won of the match , and he went behind 2 - 4 with a game of eyewatering ineptitude that included two double faults			0
but six weeks on the road , and the relentless pressure that @entity11 exerts , can do that to a man and the last fifteen minutes of this encounter should not be allowed to blight a fine effort since the @entity61			0
@entity11 , one of the fittest players on the tour , wears opponents down by retrieving every ball @entity0 's girlfriend @entity130 watches events unfold at the tournament in the @entity134 capital @entity11 holds up his hands after smashing his racket to the floor at the beginning of the second set earlier , @entity19 had found himself blasted off the court by the scorching serve of @entity142 @entity41 , who scored an outstanding 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 victory			1
had the @entity35 won , the field for the @entity89 would have been set with @entity145 and @entity39 taking the last two places after @entity37 had become the sixth qualifier in the opening match by defeating @entity149			0
but upsetting @entity19 put everything on hold , and when @entity39 beat @entity145 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 on friday night @entity41 could celebrate qualification , with @entity142 and @entity153 now being represented in @entity154			1
@entity19 , meanwhile , was left to look on the bright side that he has the weekend off before a fortnight that will see him compete in @entity154 and then the @entity158 final for @entity35			0
@entity0 chases down a @entity11 ball as he fails to take advantage of an early break in the second set @entity11 will face @entity39 in the semi-finals of the @entity165 event			2

@entity11 defeated @entity0 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 at the @entity13
@entity28 no 1 has already *sealed* his place in at the @entity48
@entity11 is heavy favourite to end the year as world no 1 after @entity19 *crashed* out to @entity41
@entity11 will play @entity39 in the semi-finals on *saturday*
