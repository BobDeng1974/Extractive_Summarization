airlines have warned that fares will inevitably rise as a result of a @entity4 decision upholding compensation payments to passengers who have suffered delays			2
two million passengers a year whose flights are delayed by technical faults could now be entitled to hundreds of pounds each after judges found such problems are the sole responsibility of the airline			2

one previous estimate , by an airline industry expert , estimated that fares could rise by £ 5 per ticket			2
@entity24 and @entity26 's applications to appeal against two flight delay compensation cases have been rejected , paving the way for thousands of new claims thousands of claims against airlines over flight delays had been put on hold until the @entity4 rulings @entity24 and @entity26 had appealed against the @entity36 's decision in two cases about the consumer			1
both @entity24 and @entity26 had appealed against previous court decisions			1
in the @entity24 case a passenger successfully challenged the airline 's view that a 27 - hour delay to an october 2011 flight amounted to an ' extraordinary circumstance '			1
the upholding of the @entity26 case , which goes back to 2006 , confirms consumers in @entity50 and @entity51 have six years to bring a claim for flight delay compensation			1
a spokesperson for @entity55 told @entity56 that the current system was not sustainable			1
' like the rest of the industry we are disappointed by today ’s ruling by the @entity4			0
the current application of @entity63 has been extended beyond its original scope and does not offer a fair model for low cost , leisure airlines			0
' ultimately , the customer will end up bearing additional costs through increased fares across the industry			1
' we would encourage the @entity72 to revisit and reform the regulation to reflect the true nature of operating a @entity76 airline			0
' we do n’t yet know how much fares will increase			0
we are focusing on settling the outstanding claims now that there is clarification around the application of the regulation in relation to technical issues			0
' @entity84 , creator and founder of @entity86 , said : ' the clarity of this ruling is crucial for thousands frustrated by the airlines ' stubborn attitude on this issue			0
' quite simply , the ruling states airlines are responsible for technical faults in all but extraordinary circumstances and that you can reclaim back at least six years			1
@entity97 - based law firm @entity96 said the @entity24 case could lead to claims of around £ 876 million a year from passengers while the @entity26 case could lead to an estimated £ 3.89 billion in compensation			1
' this is a landmark day for passengers everywhere , ' said @entity105 , senior partner at @entity106 @entity107 @entity108 , 41 , of @entity109 , can keep the £ 975 plus interest ( a total of £ 1,488.73 ) that he was awarded from @entity26 after his flight with his wife from @entity114 to the @entity115 on christmas day 2006 was delayed six hours 26 minutes			1
@entity26 appealed the order for payment made by judge @entity118 at @entity119 on the grounds that it was outside the two year limitation period for claims under the 1999 @entity124			1
but lord justice @entity125 unanimously agreed that claims can be made up to six years after the event under @entity76 law , and that mr @entity108 was just inside that limit			1
@entity130 says decision affects more than 11m passengers			0
@entity134 @entity133 @entity135 , 58 , of @entity136 , won his battle with @entity138 after his flight from @entity140 to @entity141 in 2011 was delayed for 27 hours			1
the airline claimed a technical fault was ' unforeseeable ' and they should n't have to pay compensation			2
but the judges ruled the fault was not an ' extraordinary circumstance ' and they must pay			0
after his victory mr @entity135 said : ' i am absolutely delighted with the decision			2
after everything i have been through to get to this point it 's a fantastic day			0
' i always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it 's nice to get to this milestone			0
the result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar difficulties to me			0
' @entity163 , the chief executive of the body representing @entity166 airlines , the @entity166 @entity165 , said : ' the @entity4 decision is both surprising and disappointing			0
' @entity166 airlines support the principle of passenger protection and always meet their legal obligations			0
however , the rules should be clear , affordable and proportionate for the sake of passengers and airlines			0
' the current system fails those tests and this decision will further increase costs which ultimately are borne by all passengers			2
