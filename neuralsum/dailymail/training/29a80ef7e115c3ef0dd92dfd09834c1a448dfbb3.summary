by @entity0 friends have revealed that @entity2 was aware of her husband 's most recent indiscretions months before he decided to run for @entity6 mayor			1
when 23 - year - old @entity8 released sexual messages on tuesday that showed @entity10 continued his inappropriate online relationships well beyond his 2011 resignation from congress , all eyes were turned to @entity2 to see if she knew			1
she stood by her man - though looking nervous and uncomfortable while doing so - and declared that she was aware of his behavior and they decided a mayoral run was right for the family			0
her friends have now spoken out saying that she was devastated when she originally learned about his relapse but she has had months to come to terms with the news			1
warning : @entity24 show of support : @entity2 revealed on tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions ' before and after ' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign ' when she found out , she was furious			1
she was furious , and she thought long and hard about leaving , and ultimately decided what was best for her and her son and her family was to continue to try to work through it , ' unidentified friends told @entity38			1
telling her side : @entity2 wrote an essay about her love of her husband and family in next month 's @entity44 they added that it was her decision to attend and speak at the press conference on tuesday , and she did not make that choice under any pressure from her husband or his campaign			1
she has taken a number of tactical steps during the campaign , as she made a conscious choice to speak to @entity56 alongside @entity10 and their son @entity57 in june 2012			1
she also has been on the campaign trail with him , appearing in his official launch video and attending events at his side			0
an essay she wrote about their difficult journey over the past two years is scheduled to appear in next month 's issue of @entity44 , timed so that the publication coincides with the @entity71 primary on september 10			2
@entity2 herself marked the biggest difference between @entity10 's two devastating press conferences - the first when he resigned in 2011 following the accidental release of a photo of his clothed genitals on his @entity79 account , and then the press conference on tuesday			1
in 2011 , a then - pregnant @entity2 was lauded for choosing not to stand next to her disgraced , weepy husband though he said that they decided to work on their marriage			0
but now , following her press conference debut , immediate comparisons were drawn between she and @entity87 , who served as the inspiration for @entity90 's hit show @entity91 following her decision to stand next to the former governor when he admitted to using prostitutes			1
where they started : @entity2 and @entity10 got married in july 2010 , less than a year before he resigned big signal : she was lauded for not standing next to @entity10 when he resigned in 2011 , but now her decision to change tact on tuesday has drawn criticisms ' she 's not the " good wife "			1
if she had found out yesterday she would n't have been standing there , ' her friends told the @entity38			1
' she knew it was going to be a long and tough time , and she knew he had n't hit rock bottom			1
' in her statement on tuesday , @entity2 was clear to mention that they have gone through ' a whole lot of therapy ' to get to the point where they are now , and other friends believe she sees his relapse as part of the healing process			1
' she ’s not fine and she ’s not in good spirits			0
no one ‘ s fine when they go through this			0
but the emotional part of this was last fall , ' and unidentified confidante told the @entity124			2
' i assume ( she stayed ) because he was trying to beat this , and knew that ’s part of the process			1
' standing united : @entity10 had his wife @entity2 at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned aside from her appearance at tuesday 's press conference , @entity2 has reverted to her low - profile ways , holing up in the couple 's @entity140 apartment on wednesday with a brief escape when she went into an awaiting car			1
no official statements or plans have been released but insiders expect she will keep a lower profile moving forward in the campaign			0
her decision to stay with @entity10 after the first revelations in 2011 was largely accepted by the public , under the assumption that he stopped communicating other woman and focusing on their marriage			1
on the sidelines : @entity2 has been working for @entity157 ( pictured here in 2012 when she was serving as secretary of state ) since 1996 and is considered one of her top aides ' i tell my friends things that @entity10 does and they 're always like , ' really ? he does that ? ! my husband does n't do that			1
' i mean , i have not washed a single piece of clothing ever			0
@entity10 does all our laundry			2
i have not been to our dry cleaner			0
he makes my tea when i get up in the morning			0
he 's just a loving , caring , thoughtful spouse and partner , ' she told people in late june 2012			2
now his messages with @entity180 prove that he struck up a new virtual romance less than two weeks later , which led to graphic chats , phone sex conversations and an exchange of naked pictures of his genitals			0
' i have no way of knowing whether @entity2 , for whom i have great respect , is responding out of new motherhood , the @entity192 or a mystery , ' women 's rights activist @entity187 told @entity194			2
a number of commentators have linked her behavior - or her ' @entity198 ' - come straight from the pages of her mentor and longtime boss @entity157			0
@entity2 is the former secretary of states ' top aide and has worked with her since 1996 when she was first lady			0
though the @entity203 have said from the beginning of the mayoral race that they will not be endorsing any candidate - citing their close ties to many from when mrs @entity157 was the senator of @entity6 - @entity2 has used her connections to help bring in big money donors for her husband			0
' her loyalty is to @entity157 and her role model is @entity157			0
doormats with the promise of a payoff later down the road , ' conservative radio host @entity214 said			0
photos : the @entity221 also released two pictures that @entity180 ( left ) claimed @entity10 sent her of his genitals the criticism is not only coming from the right , though the @entity71 are tending to focus on @entity10 rather than @entity2			2
minority leader @entity227 , who was one of the most vocal voices calling for @entity10 's resignation in 2011 , today told @entity231 's @entity230 that his recent conduct is ' reprehensible , disrespectful of women '			1
congressman @entity234 , who has been the @entity71 representative for @entity235 for over 40 years , echoed those sentiments on @entity237 wednesday morning			0
' nobody that i know understands at all what @entity10 was thinking about			2
and right now , i think you would agree that we all are concerned about his wife			2
she 's a brave lady , ' congressman @entity234 told @entity237 on wednesday			0
' i have seen a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their wives for support , but i do n't ever recall seeing a wife looking and feeling so sad and embarrassed , because @entity2 is a very private person , a very delicate , sophisticated person			2
and all the years that i 've known her , putting her into this political situation , as bright and as intelligent as she is , is very awkward			0

@entity10 's wife appeared at a tuesday press conference confirming that she knew that he messaged women after his resignation
friends say she was ' furious ' when she first found out months *ago*
she knew that he had n't hit ' rock bottom ' and thought the relapse was part of the healing process
