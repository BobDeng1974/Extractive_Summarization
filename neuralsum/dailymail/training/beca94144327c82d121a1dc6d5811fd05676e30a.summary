it is the only all - @entity1 quarter - final of this @entity2 and perhaps the most intriguing ; two countries with three final appearances between them since 1998			1
@entity7 are building momentum from an unfancied position , @entity6 are stuttering a little among plenty of expectation			1
each will play a variation on 4 - 3 - 3 , with @entity7 fielding a more compact midfield and @entity6 a less - obvious centre - forward			1
but it will come down to how the players perform			2
here is @entity20 ’s analysis of the probable starting line - ups			2
scroll down to see the final score masters : @entity6 are looking to reach their fourth consecutive @entity2 semi-final together : the @entity26 squad , who have surprised many , show their team spirit in training goalkeeper @entity32 ( @entity33 ) - age 27 , caps 61 captain has performed well and enhanced his reputation in @entity36			1
some fine saves coupled with an alertness for danger			2
the extinguisher : @entity32 has continued his fine form for @entity33 into the @entity2 @entity42 ( @entity43 ) - age 28 , caps 49 operated more like a sweeper in the extra-time victory over @entity46 and dominates his area			1
can be rushed on kicks			2
sweeper - keeper : @entity42 let nothing get past him , or in front of him , in the win over @entity46 verdict : two goalkeepers magnetically repelled to their own goal - line , @entity42 edges it by stature and big - match experience			1
@entity58 : @entity42 highlights right - back @entity59 ( @entity60 ) - age 28 , caps 24 , @entity61 2 @entity62 wants him to replace @entity63 at @entity64			1
he gets the nod for his nation in any case			2
dependable and an attacking threat			0
wanted man : @entity59 is being tracked by @entity64 as a replacement for @entity26 @entity63 @entity72 ( @entity43 ) - age 25 , caps 43 shifted to right - back by @entity76 ’s move to midfield , the position is not his best			1
perfectly capable and good on the ball but looks odd			0
odd ball : @entity72 has had to fill in at right - back , and could be @entity6 's weak link in @entity82 verdict : @entity59 is playing in his preferred position and will be more comfortable than @entity72			1
left - back @entity85 ( @entity86 ) - age 33 , caps 61 ageing limbs led to criticism at @entity86 but he has blossomed in @entity36 , putting in shifts of pace and poise			0
experience : @entity85 has shown he still has it in the locker in @entity36 after some uneasy times at @entity96 @entity97 ( @entity98 ) - age 26 , caps 25 , @entity61 2 flexibility across the back - line gives @entity6 greater options and as club captain for @entity98 offers leadership			1
solid : @entity97 has justified his selection at left - back during the @entity2 verdict : another position where a specialist looks a surer bet , while @entity85 also brings huge experience			1
centre - back @entity113 ( @entity114 ) - age 24 , caps 22 , @entity61 2 the man with the intense eyes and intense style has begun to show why @entity114 paid £ 18million for him			0
athletic if a little erratic			0
rebuilding reputation : @entity113 ( below ) has shown why @entity114 splashed the cash on him last summer per @entity121 ( @entity64 ) - age 29 , @entity122 102 , @entity61 4 developed into a favourite at @entity64 and is a composed character on and off field			0
towering presence while immobility made up for by anticipation			0
cleared : @entity121 was on the form of his life last season , and has brought his confidence to @entity36 verdict : mertesacker has an ability to organise that @entity113 does not – could be key with malleable opposition attacks			0
centre - back @entity137 ( @entity138 ) - age 21 , caps 10 looks at ease on this stage for a 21 - year - old			0
@entity142 smooth in possession and a threat from corners			0
rock : @entity138 centre - half @entity137 looks to have experience way beyond his years @entity149 ( @entity150 ) - age 25 , caps 33 , @entity61 3 brings blood and thunder from @entity150 and a high level of technical proficiency			0
towering : @entity149 ( right ) goes up for a challenge with @entity157 's @entity156 in the 1 - 0 group stage win verdict : @entity138 ’s @entity137 may be young but can become a great			2
he pips the elder man			0
centre - midfield @entity161 ( @entity162 ) - age 28 , caps 33 , @entity61 3 has shone for @entity7 in deeper role , dictating play from in front of the back four and advancing to unleash trademark shots from range			1
poise : @entity162 midfielder @entity161 has dropped deeper for @entity7 , and the team have benefited @entity76 ( @entity43 ) - age 30 , @entity122 110 , @entity61 5 the @entity172 experiment continues for the national team			1
quite astonishing he can adapt so seamlessly to such a degree			0
next up : @entity76 applauds the fans after their narrow 2 - 1 win over @entity46 verdict : a very close call			2
@entity76 is the more established , even if newer to this position , and his wealth of knowledge vital			0
centre - midfield @entity182 ( @entity162 ) - age 27 , caps 27 , @entity61 5 has enjoyed a real break - out moment this tournament			0
gets @entity7 ticking at good tempo and performs essential defensive function too			1
surrounded : @entity182 has shone both up and down the pitch during his four appearances @entity189 ( @entity43 ) - age 29 , caps 105 , @entity61 23 has seemed short of his best at the @entity2			1
at his peak a player who can drive on a team through desire and technique			0
@entity196 man : @entity6 legend @entity189 should earn his 106th cap on friday verdict : @entity182 is quietly producing some excellent stuff , in a similar vein to @entity200 from 1998			1
centre - midfield @entity201 ( @entity202 ) - age 21 , caps 15 , @entity61 3 grows as each match goes by , dominating central areas with strength and finesse			1
may look like a gazelle but is hard as rhino			0
central man : @entity201 put in a magnificent midfield performance against @entity211 @entity212 ( @entity64 ) - age 25 , caps 59 , @entity61 18 much like his debut @entity64 season , has sparkled at times and been subdued at others			1
can turn a game with a flick of his boot			0
hands aloft : @entity64 man @entity212 scores his 18th goal for @entity6 in the 2 - 1 win over @entity46 on monday verdict : @entity212 was once a 21 - year - old taking the @entity2 by storm , but this is @entity201 ’s time now			1
right - wing @entity225 ( @entity226 ) - age 29 , caps 37 , @entity61 6 the personification of a pocket rocket			0
small in stature , big on impact			0
provides a nimble outlet from defence to ease pressure and cutting edge too			0
overjoyed : @entity225 ( right ) looks delighted as the @entity26 secured their place in the quarters @entity237 ( @entity43 ) - age 24 , caps 48 , @entity61 5 such an elegant player			2
through the middle would be his preferred role but the interchangeable nature of this forward trio means he can influence matters			0
eye on the prize : @entity237 is concentrating on his international duty despite heavy rumours of a transfer verdict : @entity225 is in his pomp at this @entity2 , and for this match looks a key player			2
left - wing @entity251 ( @entity252 ) - age 23 , @entity122 8 , @entity61 3 surname sounds @entity254 , developed his football in @entity256 , but has emerged as the solution to @entity7 ’s issue on the left			2
winger : @entity261 is @entity7 ' answer on the left of midfield @entity265 ( @entity43 ) - age 22 , caps 33 , @entity61 10 has been one of @entity6 ’s best players at this tournament and offers @entity270 support on the goal hunt			1
denied : @entity265 sees his shot saved by @entity46 goalkeeper @entity274 during the last 16 game verdict : similar players , both diminutive and excellent on the ball – @entity265 edges because of his experience			0
centre - forward @entity280 ( @entity138 ) - age 26 , caps 70 , @entity61 24 the required spike to @entity7 ’s attack , has scored goals , created chances and come - of - age at a major international tournament			1
up top : @entity280 has three goals and two assists in his four appearances at this @entity2 @entity270 ( @entity43 ) - age 24 , caps 53 , @entity61 21 nine @entity2 goals in nine matches is some feat for a guy who nobody would recognise as an out - and - out striker			1
drifts across the front and will shot on sight			0
i 'm the man : @entity270 has scored four and assisted two goals in his four games so far verdict : so different , so difficult to compare			1
@entity270 is the ultimate scorer at this event though , so he wins out			2

the @entity26 have surprised a few during their four games , while @entity316 's @entity6 are *typically* solid
