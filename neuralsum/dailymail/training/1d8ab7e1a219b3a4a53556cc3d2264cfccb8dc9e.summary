i ’ve just got back from a training camp in @entity2 and it was such an amazing trip			1
i ’d never been and had seen a lot of films about @entity6 and @entity2			1
despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things , it had such a good vibe			0
everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy			1
at every bus stop or by the beach , almost at every point you could see , there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on			0
so there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool			0
i ’ve never seen anything like it			0
it was a perfectly balanced trip for us , which was really good			0
we ’re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up			0
it keeps you fresh and it ’s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other			2
@entity43 marks his departure for @entity2 for a @entity46 diving training camp with a selfie @entity43 says going to @entity2 was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the @entity49 without @entity51 funding , we would n’t be able to go out and do trips like this			1
of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed , but it ’s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead			2
we got a lot of serious training done and when @entity59 , our performance director , decided to go to @entity2 , it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world			1
to have that was a really big part of going there			0
but we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there – @entity59 definitely got that one right ! it was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go			1
hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode			0
health-wise it also helps us boost our vitamin d with all the sunshine			0
that gets low in the winter so there ’s no better way to top that up than spend some time in @entity2 ! unfortunately we could n’t eat street food because , with strict drug testing , we have to know what goes in our bodies , but the food at the hotel was incredible			1
there was so much rich , vibrant fruit , which was great , but going out to eat was tough			2
none of us speak @entity94 and there was n’t much @entity96 spoken , so when @entity97 and i were free , we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about ! it was great to enjoy moments like that and i think we are the closest knit team in @entity46 a lot of training programmes train together 24/7 but we ’re scattered all over the country			1
there ’s a bunch of us in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 so when we come together it ’s such a good laugh			1
going to see @entity116 the redeemer was phenomenal			0
it ’s hard to explain how good it was			0
it was n’t just the statue , it was that stunning view for miles around			0
luckily you can get a coach up to the top – we did n’t have to run up there for extra training ! it was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge , so that was a lot of fun			1
with team - mate @entity97 , @entity43 says their lack of @entity94 made it tricky to dine out in @entity2 the diving team 's performance director @entity59 ' got it right ' booking a hotel by the beach @entity43 was blown away by @entity2 's famous @entity141 statue and ' the stunning view for miles around ' the @entity46 divers get along brilliantly , says @entity43 , so enjoyed each other 's company in @entity2 it ’s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out			1
i ’ve got a music deal with @entity149 and i ’ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy			1
i ’m moving in with @entity97 in march and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training			2
as divers we have quite a big fan base in @entity157 for some reason so i recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some dj sets			2
so the first single is actually called ‘ @entity157 ’ and is dropping there first ! so it ’s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff			2
the trip to @entity2 was a small but significant step towards reaching our @entity169 dreams and it really whet our appetite			1
to stand there on the boards and see the @entity169 rings already up in the stadium , we were all thinking : ‘ @entity176 , this is going to be good			0
’ as well as funding the @entity179 athletes , every week @entity51 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			2
