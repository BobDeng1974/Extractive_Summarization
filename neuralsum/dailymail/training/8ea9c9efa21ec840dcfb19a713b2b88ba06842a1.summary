by @entity1 reporter published : 03:02 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 03:02 est , 18 june 2012 three - quarters of people suffering from mental illness are not receiving treatment , experts have revealed			2
a damning report concludes that the @entity8 is failing people suffering from mental illness			1
the authors of the report say that the under - treatment of people suffering from mental illnesses is the most ' glaring case of health inequality ' in @entity17			1
mental illness accounts for nearly half of absenteeism at work they say that mental illness now accounts for nearly half of all ill health suffered by people in @entity17 - and it can be more debilitating than some chronic diseases - but only a quarter of those involved are receiving treatment			2
effective psychological therapies exist but are not widely available , the report by the @entity30 from the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) found			0
two - fifths of patients suffering from anxiety or depression can recover if they are treated by means such as cognitive behavioural therapy			0
the authors say that if such treatments were more widely available , it would cost the @entity8 little or nothing because it would produce savings in other healthcare areas			2
mental illness can manifest itself in physical symptoms and the group of experts estimate such symptoms cost the @entity8 at least £ 10 billion			1
much of this money would be better spent on psychological therapies , they claim			0
' despite the existence of cost - effective treatments it ( mental illness ) receives only 13 per cent of @entity8 expenditure , ' they write			1
' the under - treatment of people with crippling mental illness is the most glaring cause of health inequality in our country			2
' one third of families have a member who is currently suffering from a mental illness , they say			2
it accounts for nearly half of absenteeism at work and mental illness accounts for nearly half of people on incapacity benefits			0
the authors , who include doctors , psychologists , @entity8 managers and economists , condemn local health commissioners for inappropriately using allocated mental health funding and say that in some areas mental health provisions are being cut			1
the authors also recommend better training of @entity88 and suggest that recruitment into psychiatry should be increased			0
they also call for an “ imperative ” upgrade of specialist help to provide children with affective therapies , as there are 700,000 children in @entity17 with behavioural problems , anxiety or depression			0
professor @entity100 of the @entity101 said that mental health is so prevalent in society that it deserves its own cabinet minister			1
he said : ' if local @entity8 commissioners want to improve their budgets , they should all be expanding their provision of psychological therapy			2
' it will save them so much on their physical healthcare budgets that the net cost will be little or nothing			0
' mental health is so central to the health of individuals and of society that it needs its own cabinet minister			1
' the report concludes : ' mentally ill people are particularly vulnerable			0
' they are often afraid to seek help or even say they are unwell , and so are their relatives			0
but they represent nearly one half of all health - related suffering in this country			0
' within the @entity8 they represent the greatest areas of unmet need among adults and children			2
' mental health charities welcomed the report			1
@entity135 chief executive @entity134 said : ' we are at an all - time low in the response of mental health services to people with severely disabling mental illness			1
' while the government has put money into psychological therapies , on the other hand resources are being drained from the fundamental care and treatment of people in crisis , those in need of in - patient care such as the suicidal , and those in the community where the cuts are depriving them of the few things that make their lives more tolerable , such as day centres , clubs , activities and occupation			0
' we support @entity100 ’s call to action , before there are too many casualties and the services become too fragmented to help them			0
' @entity168 chief executive dr @entity167 added : ' the report underlines the fact that mental health remains a poor relation to physical health despite the major links between depression , diabetes and heart disease , for example			1
' we have to tackle a situation where only 25 per cent of people with common forms of mental illness are receiving treatment and where there is massive under - investment in mental health research			1
' the @entity186 said that @entity88 are facing an ' upward spiral ' of patients suffering from mental illness			0
professor @entity189 , chair of the @entity186 , added : ' gps face tremendous challenges in caring for patients with mental health problems in primary care and we welcome any development which will help us improve their care			1
' talking therapies have the potential to transform thousands of patients ’ lives and we applaud @entity100 and his team for their efforts to extend the programme further			0
' this would be a major step forward , not only for patients , but for gps and other health professionals working in mental health			1
' @entity209 , chief executive of @entity210 , said : ' @entity100 is right to highlight how mental health is often the @entity212 service of the @entity8			1
yet the picture is even worse for children and young people ’s mental health where for every pound spent by the @entity8 less than a penny is spent on @entity218			1
' getting it right for children when they are young plays a key part in reducing the number of people who suffer with mental illness throughout their lives			0
' care services minister @entity226 said : ' mental ill - health costs £ 105 billion per year and i have always been clear that it should be treated as seriously as physical health problems			2
' we will shortly publish our plans to make sure the @entity8 , councils , voluntary organisations and others can play their part in improving the nation ’s mental health			1
' the @entity238 is investing £ 400 million to make sure talking therapies are available to people of all ages who need them			0
' this investment is already delivering remarkable results			0
