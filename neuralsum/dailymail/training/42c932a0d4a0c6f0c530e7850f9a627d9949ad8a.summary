by @entity0 published : 23:36 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 15:54 est , 18 december 2012 leaving : @entity1 , outgoing artistic director for the @entity2 , said she has been ' bullied ' for being @entity3 the outgoing director of the @entity2 has revealed she almost quit over anti-english ‘ bullying ’			1
@entity1 set up the company from scratch , producing plays that travelled the world , including @entity10 and @entity12 ’s one - man @entity11			1
but now , leaving the job after six years , she has spoken out about the antagonism she experienced for being @entity3			1
the @entity16 - born @entity2 artistic director is one of those attacked by @entity19 author @entity18 this week as being a ‘ colonist ’ , taking one of the best jobs north of the @entity23 before returning to @entity24			1
however , she said this was not the first time critics had used her nationality against her when questioning her work and accusing her of ignoring traditional @entity19 plays			1
she said : ‘ it really upset me because , as with all kinds of bullying , you do n’t have a voice – so the hardest thing for me was that if people had criticised the programme , i could have defended it , but when people are criticising the programme because i am @entity3 , that is indefensible			2
’ she added : ‘ i had a period – not long , because i am very strong – of a few weeks where i thought , “ i can not do this job , i do n’t know how to do it ” , that i was n’t the right person for it , and i questioned myself because i did n’t know how to make decisions any more			2
’ @entity48 was abuzz yesterday with support for the mother of two , who launched the @entity2 in 2006			1
@entity52 , whose play the @entity53 of @entity54 is one of the theatre ’s success stories , said : ‘ @entity18 ’s got it so wrong			2
what people give to @entity19 culture has nothing to do with birthplace or length of residency			2
’ critical praise : @entity2 has produced many acclaimed plays which have travelled the world , including @entity10 , pictured , about @entity19 soldiers in @entity70 @entity71 , a film critic who set up a mobile cinema to tour @entity19 with actress @entity73 , said : ‘ as a @entity75 person who ’s lived in @entity19 for 30 years , i ’ve always felt so welcome here			1
until , that is , @entity18 ’s recent remarks			0
’ trainspotting author @entity78 said : ‘ there ’s obviously a point to be made but the rhetoric deployed and the naming of individuals was just plain wrong			0
’ ' anti-english bully ' : @entity19 artist @entity18 @entity85 supporter mr @entity18 , 77 , has conceded his comments might be interpreted as ‘ anti-english prejudice ’ but added that ‘ these colonists were invited here and employed by @entity19 without confidence in their own land and people ’			0
he named miss @entity1 , along with @entity93 , a former head of the @entity95 , and an unnamed director of arts funding agency @entity97			1
miss @entity1 , who is leaving to join the @entity98 in @entity99 , did not realise at first that her @entity3 background would cause her problems			1
‘ i ’m sure it was a thing from the beginning but nobody ever communicated it to me , ’ she said			0
‘ it became a thing , interestingly , because people did n’t like my programming			0
‘ and rather than articulating that , it was easier to say the reason my programming was wrong for @entity19 was because i am @entity3 and therefore do n’t understand how to programme for @entity19			0
’ newspaper stories , letters and journal articles increasingly focused on her @entity116			0
but last year she created @entity119 , a series of events debating the traditional @entity19 plays she had been accused of neglecting			0
she also met one of her fiercest critics , writer @entity124 , and listened to his views			2
she decided the comments would not force her out of her job , adding : ‘ i always felt it was from a small group of people and did not actually represent the relationships that we had created around the rest of @entity19			0
’ she will be replaced at @entity2 by @entity135 , former head of @entity137 in @entity138 – and also @entity3			1
he said : ‘ @entity140 is almost like a second home , as it is for most people who work in theatre , but yes , i will in some ways be coming to it with fresh eyes , which will have advantages and disadvantages			0
