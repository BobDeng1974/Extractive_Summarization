by @entity0 it took our adult investigator just a few minutes to register with the fake identity of a 13 - year - old girl ' @entity6 ' ( pictured )			1
almost instantly , the profile was inundated with sexual messages it has recruited millions around the world with promises of easy flirting and rapid ‘ hook ups ’			2
but @entity13 can reveal the popular dating site @entity15 is exposing children to explicit and inappropriate adult conversations and potentially placing them at the mercy of sexual predators			1
created just two years ago , the @entity15 app is a runaway success , claiming to make seven million matches a day worldwide			1
it works by beaming pictures of nearby potential partners to a phone or tablet and inviting an instant ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ verdict			2
a million @entity30 have signed up in the past two months alone , while celebrity users include @entity32 and @entity33			1
the site is said to have revolutionised the world of casual sex – yet it is openly recruiting children as young as 13			1
we can also reveal that : in fact , it is disturbingly easy for adults to masquerade as teenagers on the app. it took our adult investigator just a few minutes to register with the fake identity of a 13 - year - old girl			1
from then on , they were free to ‘ rate ’ other teenaged members			0
as @entity52 , head of online safety at the @entity54 , warns : ‘ these apps can make a young person vulnerable to potential abusers knowing their current location as well as personal details such as where they live , socialise , work or study			1
’ for our investigator , the torrent of sexual messages began as soon as she registered			0
‘ u wan na swap pics ? ’ asked one			2
it ’s just for me , no one else			0
i ’ll go first if u want			0
’ another suggested the girl prepare for a ‘ bumpy ride with lots of potholes ’			0
‘ so … nudes ? ’ asked a third			0
whether these messages were being sent by teenage boys or adults was not clear			2
most parents would be shocked in either case			0
another person claiming to be 16 said : ‘ f * * * * * * tired			0
been planting hedges all day for the last three days x. ’ he worked on a hill farm , he explained , continuing : ‘ getting chonged [ high on drugs ] and drivingtractors , whats not to love ? ’ @entity15 says it has comprehensive safeguards in place , pointing out that to sign up , you must first belong to @entity96 , which has its own registration process			1
on giving their age , new @entity15 users are directed either to the main site or a section specifically for 13 - 17 - year - olds			1
but the process is worryingly simple to circumvent			0
this was all she needed to create her fake @entity15 registration			1
the sexual dangers posed by the internet to young people can not be under - estimated			1
@entity118 deliveryman @entity117 , 48 , posed as a 17 - year - old @entity119 lookalike to scourthe internet for teenagers who he would sexually assault			1
he has now been jailed for 33 years			0
the dangers are magnified as the technology advances			0
young users now link it to their social media sites , including picture sites such @entity130 , where you can post photos and videos , and @entity134 , which lets users send pictures that are supposed to disappear after being viewed by the recipient			1
some vulnerable youngsters even give out their email addresses and mobile phone numbers			0
and there is every danger that some @entity15 members might be even younger than 13			1
children have demonstrated an ability to circumvent the electronic barriers erected by adults			1
according to a recent @entity150 survey , around 60 per cent of teenagers have been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves , four in ten admitted creating an image , a quarter saidthey had sent one and an incredible 15 per cent revealed they had sent it to a total stranger			0
seven per cent of @entity15 ’s ten million users worldwide are under 17			1
giving children warnings is one thing , persuading them to stay away is another			2
few other sites have the thrilling directness of @entity15			1
pop star @entity165 caused speculation about the state of her marriage after revealing she was using the site , while @entity171 cricketer @entity170 , it is alleged , invited a blonde backpacker he met on @entity15 back to his hotel room after losing to @entity174 in the @entity175			1
according to a recent @entity150 survey , around 60 per cent of teenagers have been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves			0
seven per cent of @entity15 's ten million users worldwide are under 17 ( library image ) but it is for children that @entity15 ’s temptations cause most concern			1
as the @entity54 ’s @entity52 adds : ‘ we ca n’t turn back the clock – internet and social media use is now commonplace among children and young people , and many use it in a positive way to learn and socialise			1
‘ but verifying the age of a user is difficult			2
consequently , although some platforms are designated for younger users , there is the very real risk of harmful contact with adults			2
‘ this lack of adequate safeguarding is putting children at risk – service providers and website owners must make it as easy as possible for young people to report upsetting content and behaviour , and take swift action to tackle it			1
’ conservative mp @entity213 , a father of teenage children who campaigns for strong families , said he was horrified at what our investigator encountered			2
‘ i would absolutely have concerns about 13 - year - olds on @entity15 , ’ he said			1
' a huge danger of being pursued by paedophiles ' ‘ it is very young and huge care needs to be taken			2
there are many other ways for them to meet boys and girls safely			2
’ so far , however , the newly minted millionaires behind the app have been unwilling to tackle the darker side of their invention			2
@entity15 was set up in august 2012 by three @entity234 university graduates @entity235 , @entity15 and @entity236			2
they launched it by hosting a party where students downloaded the app at the door , and soon found they had an enormous success on their hands			0
users are asked to flick through the profiles and pictures of other members and rate them for sexual attraction			2
if you swipe left or hit a cross symbol , the profile disappears with ‘ nope ’ stamped across their forehead			0
swipe right , or hit the heart , and it says : ‘ liked			0
’ mutual right swipes result in a match , with a prompt to either send a message or ‘ keep playing ! ’ a ‘ swipe right ’ has already entered the global language of dating			0
after two years , @entity15 boasts an average 500 million swipes a day			1
users typically log on 11 times daily			0
‘ we realised there ’s an inherent tension that exists between people , ’ founder @entity15 said at the time of launching			1
‘ you ’re either going after a relationship , and you ’re the aggressor , and you feel like you ’re prone to rejection – or someone ’s going after you , and you feel bombarded and annoyed , which means you have to do the rejecting yourself			0
’ @entity235 added : ‘ as humans , we have this innate desire to meet people			0
in the past , social networks were concerned with connecting you with distant members of your network of friends			0
‘ @entity15 is all about connecting you with new people			1
‘ and we find that valuable , especially because we ’re constantly running around and do n’t have time to slow down and meet people			0
’ from wealthy @entity295 @entity294 families , both @entity292 and @entity235 were included on the @entity296 2013 30 under 30 list			0
their company is now valued at £ 3 billion			0
@entity292 , 27 , now has a high - profile girlfriend , @entity300 , 20 , daughter of computer billionaire @entity302			0
she is known as ‘ @entity303 ’			0
in a prepared statement , @entity15 said : ‘ there will always be people that will try to violate our terms of service			1
we have security measures in place that keep the @entity15 ecosystem as authentic as possible			2
‘ users are able to block and report anyone that is engaging in inappropriate behaviour			0
‘ we delete any profile that violates our terms of service			0
’ @entity15 ’s founders clearly believe that locating their app within the world of @entity96 keeps it safe enough			1
@entity235 says : ‘ there ’s nothing wrong with 13 and 17 - year - olds making friends on @entity15			1
‘ it all goes through @entity96 , so if @entity96 does a good job of verifying their data , we can rely on their service			0
’ @entity96 commented : ‘ people have to be 13 to sign up to @entity96			2
in addition , communication between parents and young people about their use of the internet is vital			1
’ and mp @entity213 added : ‘ parents and schools really need to start alerting children to the dangers of potentially being groomed , courted and pursued by paedophiles who are posing as people of their own age group			1
‘ it is a huge danger			0
