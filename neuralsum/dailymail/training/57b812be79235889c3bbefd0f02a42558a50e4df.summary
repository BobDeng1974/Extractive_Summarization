@entity0 has refused to echo prime minister @entity2 's dramatic attacks on @entity4 president @entity3 , heaping praise on her instead			1
mr @entity2 publicly flayed prof @entity3 after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention			1
' it 's a political stitch - up , ' said mr @entity2 of the report			1
he told @entity12 on tuesday that his government had lost confidence in @entity15			0
but the communications minister struck a different tone on wednesday , highlighting prof @entity3 ' reputation in the legal community and emphasising the focus should be on children in detention			1
i mean i 've known @entity3 for many years , ' mr @entity0 told reporters			1
' she 's a very distinguished legal academic			1
i knew her when she was the @entity26 at @entity27			0
' but i do n't , i do n't want to get into ... this has become a very controversial issue and there 's lots of allegations flying about			0
' he then echoed remarks he made on @entity43 earlier in february , saying the government must focus on getting kids out of detention			1
' she 's a very distinguished legal academic , ' mr @entity0 ( above ) told reporters of @entity3 mr @entity0 , pictured , appeared at a @entity50 phone exchange in @entity51 , outside of @entity52			1
mr @entity0 is a member of mr @entity2 's cabinet and serves as communications minister ' the critical thing is the children , we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention			1
' and the fact is , the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time			1
' mr @entity0 said the government had reduced the number of children in detention from the 1400 under @entity69 in september 2013			1
the millionaire was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month			0
mr @entity0 did not stand for the position and mr @entity2 won the vote without a candidate standing against him , 61 to 39			1
look , i ’m not going to engage in a discussion about personalities , i ’d just make this observation about the children in detention issue			2
when the @entity69 won office in 2007 there were no children in detention because of the @entity87 ’s successful management of our borders			2
there were no boats , there was no people smuggling , and so there were no kids in detention			0
as you know , @entity96 changed the policy , there was a massive increase in people smuggling , a massive increase in unauthorised arrivals , and we had a peak of 2000 kids in detention and at the time that we came into government , when @entity69 was voted out in 2013 , there were about 1,400 children in detention			1
that number , in terms of children onshore is 126 and as you know from what @entity115 said in estimates this week that is rapidly coming down			0
so the bottom line is this : any child in detention , one child in detention is one child too many			0
you know , this is not -- everyone is anguished by having children locked up in detention			2
we do n’t want to have any children in detention			2
the best way for children not to be in detention of course is for them not to get on to people smugglers ’ boats			2
and of course we ’ve effectively ensured that by stopping the boats , by @entity135 stopping the boats			0
going forward , our goal is to get those kids out of detention , and of course if they ’re not coming in the front door it ’s much easier to reduce the numbers and that is what is happening			0
@entity145 , as you know , is very focussed on that and i think we have a very good story			0
i just want to recap : the issue is not @entity3 , or personalities , or arguments about the @entity4			1
the issue is the children			0
you know , all of us , as parents in particular , know how anguished it must be for children to be in these circumstances			0
of course they were put there by their parents choosing to come to @entity163 on people smugglers ’ boats , we are getting them out of detention and that is , that is one of the signal achievements of the government			2
look , i ’m not going to buy into this discussion about @entity3 ; i mean i ’ve known @entity3 for many years			2
she ’s a very distinguished international legal academic			1
i knew her when she was the @entity26 at @entity27 , but i do n’t , i do n’t want to get into , obviously this has become a very controversial issue and there are all sorts of allegations flying around			0
i do n’t want to get involved in that or comment on that today , other people can do that if they wish			0
the critical thing is the children , we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention			0
and the fact is , the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time			2
