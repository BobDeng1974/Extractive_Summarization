by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 15:53 est , 14 may 2013 it is one of the most popular games on the planet - serving an ever - growing community of millions			1
and with @entity7 3 around the corner , @entity6 talked to ceo of @entity10 , @entity11 , about the game , the challenges facing free - to - play games and ... owning a @entity15 is it about @entity7 that has made it so successful ? @entity11 : ' it ’s because @entity7 is unique ! it ’s always been easy to jump in : it ’s free to get started and runs from your web browser and does n’t the need any download			1
' the gameplay is also different from most other online rpgs – @entity7 is about freedom to do your own thing without restrictions ; you can be any type of character you want , you can explore a whole world , you can choose from a wide variety of gameplay from crafting to fighting , from trading to questing – it ’s all up to you			2
it ’s also less action intensive than most similar games , which makes it a more relaxing experience that you can take at your own pace			1
' how has the world of @entity42 been tweaked ? are there new kingdoms and different ways to travel ? @entity11 : ' @entity42 has always been evolving in the 12 years of @entity7 ’s history			2
we ’ve added new continents , new dungeons and new cities			1
' there are also many ways to travel , whether running , using teleport spells , spirit trees , fairy rings or even hot air balloons ! recently we added an easy way to travel called the @entity58 , which is ideal for new players to hop between important game locations quickly			1
' pretty as a picture : with the updated graphics engine , @entity7 3 rivals @entity63 's visual fidelity what inspired monster design in @entity7 ? @entity11 : ' a huge variety of things really , spanning from world mythology , childhood memories to the colourful corners of our own imaginations			1
' sometimes is great just to ask an artist to explore ideas using a few keywords to get the creative juices flowing , and then build the backstory of the monsters after the creation of the concept art , turning the “ normal ” process on its head			0
' as a company we have a strong background in traditional storytelling so there are always some crazy ideas floating around			0
' how did you develop / design different spells ? @entity11 : ' spells tend to start with a written design since they are generally very practical and have a strong motive behind their addition to the game			1
' we need to think about their cost to cast ( mages use rune stones to release magical energy , a bit like mystical batteries ) and the amount of damage they do to opponents			0
@entity7 is an @entity111 ( @entity111 )			0
players travel around the land of @entity42 battling monsters and trading			1
with more than 200million accounts created , it was recognised by the @entity118 as the largest mmorpg in the world			0
' mages in @entity7 do n’t only deal with big fireballs and lightning bolts in combat though , we have spells for all sorts of things , including baking pies , enchanting magical jewellery and even turning bones into bananas			0
these spells are often themed to different sorts of spell books too			0
' are there many changes to the in - game trading mechanic ? @entity11 : ' no. in @entity7 players are free to trade pretty much anything to anyone , and we have a player run grand exchange stock market , where players buy and sell items from humble potatoes to glorious god swords			1
' prices are calculated by actual supply and demand and so can fluctuate depending on the activity of the players at the time			1
' how have you listened to fans criticisms of the first game ? and have the fans steered the development of the game ? @entity11 : ' definitely , we ’ve always been community focused and this year we ’re really trying to step that up again			0
' the story in @entity7 is going to be shaped by players , week by week over the course of this year			1
' we ’re doing beta tests for the new @entity166 client and the @entity167 because we really want player feedback to guide our development			1
we ’ve also recently run a poll to see which other storyline players want to see continued next – the @entity173 quest series triumphed over @entity174 and gnomes ! ' towering heights : this is the largest of the @entity7 games , boasting new cities and continents can we expect to see many changes in combat ? @entity11 : ' we released a brand new combat system last year and have been working with our players to polish it ever since			1
it ’s far more exciting and engaging than ever before , rewarding players for tactical decisions and intelligent use of equipment … as well as being really fun ! ' @entity7 does n’t limit players to only ever adopt one combat style , so you can find yourself switching between brutal 2 handed swords , magical staffs , duel wielding crossbows , tower shields , even summon mighty creatures to do your bidding			2
' are there any changes in the @entity203 ? ( answered above ) how have you rid the game of unbalanced trading and real currency being traded for virtual goods ? @entity11 : ' rather than make modifications to the gameplay to deal with unwanted activity , we have specialised systems that can detect accounts that are real world trading and deal with them according to our rules			0
' “ fairness ” is incredibly important to us and we do n’t ignore the problem like other games often do			0
we actively hunt those who are generating wealth ( also known as gold farming ) with the intention to sell , and often seek legal solutions to the problem			0
' how have the graphics been improved ? do you think it can compete visually with the likes of @entity229 now ? @entity11 : ' @entity7 is definitely one of the best looking browser games out there and we ’re competitive with even the big download - based titles out there			2
' the new @entity166 client also gives us a great platform to continue building on , further improving the graphics with better visual fidelity and more visual effects			1
' open to everyone : graphics can be scaled up or down depending on your hardware specifications what does the future of @entity243 hold ? do you think it ’ll be a ‘ @entity246 ’ – where we see just one or two dominant @entity248 ruling online ? @entity11 : ' mmos have definitely been diversifying and it ’s not just a genre full of @entity229 clones any more			2
' there are many more games on offer and free to play is becoming the standard			0
players have much more choice now , so it ’s not enough to have just a decent game anymore – to survive @entity248 will need to be have something really interesting and different on offer			2
' the most successful games will be those who can managed to both innovate whilst also listening carefully to their communities			0
' lastly , is it true that you own a tank ? @entity11 : ' yes , that is true - and you wo n't believe how little it costs to insure ! the @entity270 is n't great , though			2
' @entity271 is released in the summer			0
follow us on @entity273 : @ @entity274 and on @entity275 : @entity276 .			0
