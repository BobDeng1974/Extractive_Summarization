' concealed behind this charming and amicable children 's entertainer , lay a man who exploited the very children who were drawn to him ' @entity24 , prosecuting the court also heard details of other women who claim they were groped by @entity3 , but their complaints are not part of the charges on the indictment because they happened abroad before the law changed in 1997 to allow such claims to be prosecuted in the @entity107			1
