by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 17:19 est , 2 october 2013 @entity1 has trained as many as 10,000 dogs for television , movies , commercials , videos and people			1
then he started saving dogs from animal shelters , training them and finding homes for them			1
when @entity12 needed a dog trainer who would rescue , train and place 22 dogs in 22 weeks for a show called @entity17 for @entity18 , they did n't have to look far			1
he will start each week spending several hours at a shelter , evaluating dogs			2
that may be the hardest part , especially given that at least 9,000 dogs and cats are euthanized each day because homes ca n't be found for them			2
that means i have to walk by 99 i ca n't take			0
all 100 are very trainable , very place - able and just as smart as the next dog			2
often the one i choose just comes down to one i make a connection with , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity1 , 36 and single , said the dogs will be proficient in the seven common commands — sit , stay , down , come , off , heel and no. ' my theory of training is a lot like martial arts			1
you learn the technique one day and you perfect it for years to come			0
with the dogs , i teach them technique when i am training them			2
i teach the family to perfect the technique over the years to come			0
' his dogs are really good at seven commands instead of being just average at 20 commands , he said			2
' less is more when it comes to dog training			0
' @entity1 will choose the family by evaluating emails he receives at his @entity41 ranch — aptly named the @entity75 - and checking out the house and yard where the new dog will live			1
at the end of the show , the dog and family meet			0
@entity1 spends a couple of hours training the family			1
most of the dogs chosen for the show will be under 5 because that 's what the families have asked for			2
the commands the dogs learn include come , down , heel , no , off , sit and stay at the end of the show , the dog and family meet			0
@entity1 spends a couple of hours training the family adorable : the show @entity17 airs on saturday morning across the @entity99 abuse will not be part of their past			1
@entity1 can tell which dogs have been abused in the first 30 seconds he spends with them			1
' and i can tell you how they were abused in the first few minutes , ' he said			0
those dogs are a passion for @entity1 off - camera , but they will not appear on @entity17			1
' the viewers that watch this show are not going to want to see a dog that 's been in a fight			0
this is a family show , ' he explained			0
@entity17 is targeted to teens 13 to 16 years old , but @entity1 is guessing a lot of moms will be watching			1
@entity17 airs on saturday morning ( check local listings for time ) , followed by another @entity124 show called dr @entity125 , which follows @entity127 veterinarian @entity126 as he treats a wide variety of animals			1
the two shows premiered saturday			0
along with four other @entity124 shows , they replace saturday morning cartoons , abandoned by @entity18 because of increased competition			0
the new shows also fulfill the network 's requirement for educational television			0
@entity1 , who used to have a show on @entity140 called @entity141 , in which he studied the nocturnal behavior of animals in the wild , wo n't choose dogs that ca n't get along with children , he said			1
' but if you have a shadow of a doubt that your dog will bite a kid or if a dog has in the past bitten a kid , i would say that is a dog that should not be around kids			0
i think that 's the responsible way to look at it , ' he said .			0

trainer @entity1 , who is single and lives in @entity41 , has rescued and trained thousands of dogs
the 36 - year - old runs the @entity17 ranch in southern @entity41
