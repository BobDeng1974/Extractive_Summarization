before repelling @entity2 in the biggest shop window of all , @entity1 keeper @entity0 expressed a preference to remain in @entity5 and to play in the @entity6			1
but @entity8 clubs will have sat up and noticed the 28 - year - old as he helped @entity1 to their second clean sheet of the @entity11 in the 0 - 0 draw in @entity13			1
man - of - the - match @entity0 is a free agent after his contract with relegated @entity16 expired , but he will surely be snapped up soon after his four sensational saves denied @entity18 ( twice ) , @entity19 and @entity20			1
video @entity0 brilliance denies @entity2 announcing himself on the world stage : @entity0 made a string of incredible saves as @entity1 held @entity2 @entity27 header : @entity18 connects with @entity29 ' cross as his thumping effort heads for the bottom corner breathtaking : @entity0 flies through the air to deny @entity18 he recently told @entity33 : ' my priority is to stay in @entity36 , but i am open to any propositions			1
i have improved in the last three years , most notably in handling the pace of games			0
' but i was used to top competition when i played in @entity1			2
i now need to play in the @entity6 to be sure of my level			2
' on the basis of his performance , he appears to have it all			0
a commanding presence behind @entity1 's excellent defence , @entity0 displayed lightning reactions and the agility of a cat whenever called upon			1
heroes : while @entity0 deservedly took the plaudits , @entity1 were outstanding a commanding presence : @entity0 took charge of his area and kept out all that @entity2 could throw at him @entity56 was famed for his garish jerseys and ability to score rather than his ability between the sticks			1
he played in both the 1994 and 1998 @entity61 , winning 130 caps for his country			0
@entity2 striker @entity64 , who disappointed once again , called @entity0 's saves ' four miracles '			1
the man himself simply said : ' it was the game of my life			2
' he first drew gasps with a moment which has already been compared to ' the greatest save of all ' : @entity76 ' astonishing effort to thwart @entity77 44 years ago			0
@entity29 found space on the right and whipped in the perfect cross for the latest incumbent of @entity2 's iconic @entity83 shirt			2
he connected with the ball beautifully , sending a seemingly goalbound header to the bottom left corner			0
but there was @entity0 , leaping and extending a strong right arm to keep the ball out			2
he was called into action again just before the break			0
as @entity19 and @entity92 bore down on goal , he showed immense bravery to deny the @entity96 man with another reflex save			2
in the right place at the right time : @entity0 thwarts @entity19 ( left ) he 's at it again : @entity0 showed lighting fast reactions to deny @entity20 from close range with @entity1 playing expansive football and going toe - to - toe with @entity2 in a pulsating second half , @entity0 once again denied @entity18			1
he controlled substitute @entity107 's cross beautifully , looked up and fired a fixxing left - foot effort towards goal			0
to his disbelief , @entity0 was there again			0
his night did not end there			0
@entity20 looked odds - on to give @entity2 all three points as he rose to meet @entity18 's free - kick in the 86th minute			1
but @entity0 's hands were once again strong and the ball went out for a corner			0
@entity119 looked on in disbelief and will be relieved to have seen the back of @entity0			0
but will the likes of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 come face - to - face with the curly haired fellow from @entity128 once again ? @entity0 was in a similar vein of form for @entity16 when they faced @entity132 in the second week of @entity5 last season .			1

@entity0 was *magnificent* as @entity1 held @entity2 to a 0 - 0 draw in @entity13
he denied @entity18 twice , with great saves from close - range efforts from @entity19 and @entity20
' it was the game of my life , ' he said after the match
the 28 - year - old is a free - agent after his three - year deal at @entity16 expired
he has expressed a desire to remain in @entity5 and play in the @entity6
yet @entity0 says : ' i am open to any propositions '
