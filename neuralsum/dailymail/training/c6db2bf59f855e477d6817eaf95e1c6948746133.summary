@entity0 faces humiliation in @entity2 after a poll revealed @entity4 could be left with just three @entity2 mps after next year ’s general election			1
the @entity7 is now on course to secure more than 50 seats in may , meaning @entity9 could hold the balance of power at @entity11			1
such a dramatic collapse in @entity4 ’s support in @entity2 could easily offset any gains made in @entity15 and @entity16 and destroy mr @entity0 ’s hopes of getting into @entity18			1
@entity0 faces humiliation in @entity2 after a poll revealed @entity4 could be left with just three @entity2 mps after the @entity20 the prediction of a @entity2 wipeout comes as it was revealed mr @entity0 was barred from speaking at a key event in the referendum campaign because he was seen as a liability north of the border			1
the @entity28 / @entity27 poll of @entity11 voting intentions put the @entity7 on 43 per cent in @entity2 - nearly double its 2010 general election performance			2
@entity4 fell by 16 percentage points to 26 per cent , with the conservatives on 13 per cent , @entity33 on seven per cent and the @entity34 on six per cent			0
based on the overall poll figures , @entity4 would get ten of the 59 @entity2 seats , compared to 45 for the @entity7 , three for the @entity34 and one for the conservatives			1
but when trends for each region are taken into account , it reveals there has been a bigger 22 per cent swing towards the @entity7 in ‘ safe ’ @entity4 seats			0
it indicates @entity4 will lose all but three of the 41 seats they won in 2010 , with the @entity46 securing a commanding 53 seats , compared to just six now			0
among the constituencies that would fall to the @entity7 under this forecast is the new @entity4 leader @entity50 ’s @entity52 seat , which he has held since 1997			0
leading polling expert professor @entity53 of @entity54 said : ‘ there is no reason to believe that the swing to the @entity7 does not extend to what are supposedly the safest @entity4 seats in @entity2			1
‘ if anything , the swing appears to be even greater in such seats			0
mr @entity0 was reportedly asked by former @entity4 leader @entity63 ( right ) : ‘ why are you here ? you are not winning any votes ’ ‘ if we take into account the difference in the movement in different types of seats then the estimate becomes @entity7 53 , @entity4 three , and @entity34 three - while the @entity37 emerge empty handed			1
‘ in short , pretty much every @entity4 seat in @entity2 has to be regarded as currently at risk of being lost to the @entity7			2
’ yesterday it was claimed that mr @entity0 was stopped from speaking at a rally on the eve of the @entity2 referendum			1
mr @entity0 was reportedly asked by former @entity4 leader @entity63 ‘ why are you here ? you are not winning any votes			2
’ another @entity4 source described mr @entity0 as a ‘ total liability ’ who had a ‘ hugely negative ’ impact on the campaign and ‘ did n’t win us one vote ’			0
it was also claimed relations between mr @entity0 and his election co-ordinator @entity88 have plummeted to a new low and they are barely on speaking terms			0
mr @entity0 allies have accused mr @entity88 of ‘ sulking ’ since @entity93 mp @entity92 was put in charge of day - to - day election campaigning			0
but mr @entity88 ’s friends have hit back , claiming he is ‘ frustrated ’ by mr @entity0 ’s ‘ inability to act decisively ’			0
@entity9 stepped down as first minister following the @entity2 referendum , but will stand for the @entity7 in the @entity101 constituency at next may ’s election leading to the possibility of a comeback at @entity11 .			2

@entity4 could be left with just three mps in @entity2 after 2015 election
