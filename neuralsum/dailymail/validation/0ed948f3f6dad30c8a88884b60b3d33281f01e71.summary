@entity0 is a horse that polarises opinion , but his @entity1 record is beyond criticism and he can silence his doubters with victory at the highest level in friday 's @entity9			1
victories in the @entity11 and in a fiercely competitive handicap chase at the past two festivals endorse the view that @entity15 is a master at bringing the eight - year - old to a peak in the spring and , after a couple of modest efforts , he looked on good terms again with a better round of jumping last time in a small - field @entity23 event			1
@entity0 polarises opinion but can silence his doubters with victory in friday 's @entity9 wins in the @entity11 ( above ) in the past two @entity1 's handicap chase endorse his @entity1 form @entity15 is a master at bringing the eight - year - old @entity0 to a peak in the spring the bare form of that success is miles away from the requisite level on friday , but when @entity0 is good he is very good , as he was at @entity1 last year when beating thursday 's @entity35 runner - up @entity33			1
a subsequent @entity37 success was arguably more impressive where the selection destroyed @entity40 and fellow @entity9 contender @entity41 , among others in the @entity44 ’ @entity35 , a display which truly announced him as a potential @entity9 winner			0
he must progress again to trouble @entity49 hero @entity48 , who sets a lofty standard for his 17 rivals to surpass , but the ante - post favourite must exorcise the memories of a capitulation after the last fence a year ago , where he faded to finish fourth			0
@entity56 is convinced the stomach ulcers and breathing problems which beset @entity48 are behind him and he remains a huge danger to all , even granted his modest course record			2
@entity56 ' @entity48 has a modest course record but still poses a danger to the field stablemate @entity64 was an honourable third to @entity66 in the @entity67 , and looks a huge price given he has tons of track form and just three lengths to make up with @entity73 ’s charge			2
the form of his gritty defeat of @entity76 here before @entity78 has taken a sizeable boost this week with that rival bolting up and the tongue tie and cheekpieces are utilised in combination for the first time , which appears a shrewd move			0
his handler has sent out 36 horses to contest the @entity9 and 18 have won or been placed , so he merits real consideration for a tasty each - way wager .			0

@entity0 has an *excellent* record at @entity1 and could go all the way
@entity15 has mastered bringing the eight - year - old to a peak for spring
@entity56 ' @entity48 is a danger despite a modest course record
