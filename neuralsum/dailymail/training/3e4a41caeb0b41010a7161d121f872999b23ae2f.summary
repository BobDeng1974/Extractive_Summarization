president @entity2 should send at least 10,000 @entity4 ground troops to @entity5 to turn the tide of the war on the @entity9 terror army , a former @entity1 commander said thursday			1
retired admiral @entity10 insisted that the reality on the ground ' is not good news , but we 're going to need to put @entity4 boots on the ground there			1
' ' not 150,000 like at peak in @entity5 , but probably 10,000 , ' he explained , ' to do the advising , the training , the mentoring			1
that ’s how you make @entity5 security forces effective			0
that ’s how you get the ( @entity29 ) @entity28 in the game			2
' in that scenario , he said , ' we can still turn this thing			0
' the admiral , who is hawking his biography ' the accidental admiral , ' told an @entity67 audience that he 's ' not surprised ' @entity2 entered the @entity5 crisis with a promise to keep @entity4 ground troops out of harm 's way			1
' let 's face it : there 's enormous @entity77 fatigue in the country , ' he said			0
' the last thing in the world people want is troops back ( in @entity5 )			2
i believe we have to confront this			0
' an @entity88 / @entity87 poll released in late september showed that 72 per cent of @entity4 think @entity2 will have to change his mind			1
a smaller number , 45 per cent , said they would agree with that decision if @entity2 's top generals said it was necessary			2
it 's likely the top @entity97 brass has already presented him with that sobering reality			0
@entity2 has pledged to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' @entity9 , the self - proclaimed @entity100 of @entity48 and @entity101 , which has plowed through countless square miles of @entity48 and @entity5 in a murderous quest to establish a country based on @entity107 @entity106 law			1
' our military are giving the president a wide range of options , ' @entity10 said			2
' and within that range they will say to him , " this is very high risk if we do n’t put @entity4 boots on the ground			1
if we want to turn this thing , mr. president , we need to be putting 10,000 , maybe 15,000 troops on the ground "			1
’ ' i would guess those conversations are underway			0
i certainly hope so , ' he said			0
@entity9 is inching closer to a direct attack on @entity126 , taking a strategic military base this week in @entity128 and threatening @entity129 – a large city where hundreds of @entity4 servicemen and women died during the decade when @entity4 troops had a presence there			1
meet the @entity28 : @entity5 @entity136 who want their own state in @entity5 's northern region are fighting off @entity9 near @entity139 , but the @entity139 have their own beef with @entity29 separatists so they are n't helping @entity10 , a former @entity1 commander , is hawking a book and weighing in on the ground conditions that will dictate @entity4 's next move @entity10 said that overall , the @entity2 administration 's effort to bring @entity9 to heel through an international coalition effort is n't going well			1
' i would say it 's not , at this point , ' he said			0
' we have got to get @entity139 into the game			0
' the @entity139 share massive borders with both @entity5 and @entity48 , but their government has largely ignored @entity9 – instead focusing on ancient enmity with @entity29 separatists who are holding @entity9 back from crossing into @entity139			2
the weeks - long battle for @entity47 , a @entity48 city whose northern wall abuts @entity139 's southernmost province , has attracted scant attention from @entity162			0
' @entity139 has a 500,000 - man army , the second biggest in @entity1 , ' @entity10 said thursday			2
' they 've got to get into the game			0

retired admiral @entity10 made the claim on @entity67
' we 're going to need to put @entity4 boots on the ground there *...* to do the advising , the training , the mentoring , ' he said
@entity10 said the goal should be putting @entity9 ' in a three - front war ' against @entity28 , @entity178 and @entity4 airstrikes
recent poll shows 72 per cent of @entity4 think president @entity2 will send ground troops despite his pledge not to
