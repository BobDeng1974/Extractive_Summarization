by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 1 january 2013 three @entity2 climbers have become the first in the world to conquer the @entity6 - a lethal 20,000ft pinnacle			1
the dare - devil trio of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 spent 11 days scaling up the jagged near vertical point on @entity12 in the @entity13			2
dubbed one of the hardest climbs in the world , dozens of professional climbers had been defeated by the tricky summit - with one breaking both legs during an attempt			1
but the @entity2 climbers successfully negotiated the 20,700ft climb - sleeping in a hanging tent thousands of feet above the ground			1
the @entity6 is the central pillar in the formation and the part of the mountain most obviously shaped like a shark 's fin the climb was @entity8 's third attempt to find a route up @entity6 , and the second attempt for both @entity9 and @entity10			1
combining their three attempts , he trio has accumulated thirty - plus days on the mountain			0
mr @entity8 first tried the ascent in 2003			0
his team turned back two - thirds of the way up as a result of deep , unconsolidated snow and a lack of proper equipment for the upper wall			0
the following year set a new highpoint on the @entity6 at 6100m , but descended after one of the team broke both his legs			1
@entity8 made his second attempt with @entity9 and @entity10 in 2008			0
@entity67 is also the site of the world 's highest @entity69 from ' @entity71 '			2
in 2006 @entity73 @entity72 & @entity74 both wearing ' wing suits ' - launched themselves off a 6604 - metre high precipice on @entity67 after a 22 - day climb			2
their expedition was made up of six climbers and nine porters			2
they covered 50 metres a day on icy slopes at 80 degree gradients and in temperatures of -20			0
the team was delayed on the climb for several days during a storm but later they progressed beyond the highpoint of @entity8 's 2003 attempt			1
but the team food supply had run short as a result of the storm and on their nineteenth day they stopped about 150 metres below summit			0
@entity9 vowed never to return			0
the following year a @entity98 team attempted the same route but the weather meant they were unable to acclimatise on practise routes first			0
nevertheless , they decided to press ahead			0
after the two - day approach the team turned aback , citing a lack of proper equipment , poor acclimatization and their alpine - style approach as mistakes for an attempt on the @entity6			1
after an epic 22 - day climb up a near - vertical @entity13 peak , an @entity73 couple in their 40s took just two minutes to " fly " back to base camp and smash the world record for the highest base jump in history			2
@entity8 geared up and climbing out near the team 's highest portaledge camp at over 20,000ft resting in their fourth and highest portaledge camp at over 20,000ft , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 taking a much needed break to melt water and eat before the big summit push high camp on the @entity6 around 20,000ft on day 09 @entity8 looking out of the portaledge at over 20,000ft @entity10 looking up the route from their highest portaledge camp ( 20,000ft ) @entity9 ascending a fixed rope near 20,000 feet on day 08 of the climb @entity10 ascending a fixed line on @entity28 during the @entity134 @entity8 and @entity10 take a break from building the portaledge camp at 19,000ft during sunset to look over the @entity138 and @entity139 reaching out to the stars on @entity28 @entity10 jumaring up the fixed lines past the ' @entity143 ' pitch to the high point on day 6 of the climb @entity10 leads pitch 13 of the route on day 2 the top of the ' funnel ' pictured on day 1 shows @entity8 leading the pitch and @entity10 seconding him the team of @entity152 at @entity153 before starting the climb @entity10 checking out the stars above basecamp , the night before the approach to the base of the route on @entity28 @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity8 with a @entity160 in @entity138 at the start of the expedition watch : the three climbers taking a much needed break inside their hanging tent up @entity166 's @entity6			1

@entity6 on @entity29 's @entity28 is a near vertical climb for only the *bravest* of *explorers*
dozens of professional climbers have been defeated by the lethal summit
@entity175 slept in hanging tents thousands of feet above the ground
