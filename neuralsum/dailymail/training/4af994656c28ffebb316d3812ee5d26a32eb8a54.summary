by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 23 november 2013 @entity3 ’s @entity2 advert has given the retailer its best ever start to the festive period			1
the department store took £ 101million in the week after @entity8 and the @entity9 first aired – the earliest it has ever topped £ 100million in the @entity2 build - up			1
but while the marketing campaign set new records for sales , its heart - warming story is one some viewers say they have seen before – 33 years ago			1
@entity3 denied that the film had any influence on their creative team at advertising agency @entity35			0
but viewers were quick to point out the similarities this week , with some even accusing the company of ‘ ripping off ’ the film			1
they pointed out that both stories focus on hibernating bears seeing their first @entity2 – and both feature a magic alarm clock			1
film critic @entity45 wrote on @entity46 : ‘ the @entity3 @entity2 ad is lovely ( though no 2011 @entity49 ad )			2
and , wonderfully , it owes something to @entity2			0
’ @entity51 said : ‘ surely it is just the plot of @entity2 ? or am i the only one who remembers this classic ... ’ @entity56 added : ‘ @entity3 ripping off @entity2			0
’ inspiration : @entity59 's magic clock ( left ) and the @entity3 alarm clock used in this year 's advert the advert , which was first broadcast two weeks ago today , cost £ 7million to make			1
but it has already had nearly six million views on @entity65 and the store ’s takings for the week ending november 16 were £ 101.45million – 10 per cent up on 2012 and 19 per cent on 2011			1
the animated advert tells the story of a bear who always misses @entity2 because he is hibernating – until his friend the hare buys him a @entity3 alarm clock			1
he is woken in time for december 25 , when he emerges from his cave to discover a beautiful christmas tree and his animal friends celebrating			0
the plot bears a striking resemblance to the @entity59 film , often shown at @entity2 in the 1980s			2
@entity22 and his friend @entity82 go to bed for the winter , setting their magic alarm clock for spring			0
but they are woken just before @entity2 by friends who enlist @entity22 to ‘ save @entity2 ’ from the troublesome @entity89 and @entity90			0
response : the store denied their creative team had been influenced by the 1980 film @entity95 , who worked in advertising for 20 years , said taking inspiration from other sources was part of the creative process			2
‘ any creative person will be exposed to a range of influences in their lifetime , going back to childhood , ’ he said			0
‘ often these influences are stored in the subconscious brain , and you ca n’t unlearn what you ’ve already learnt			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said the advert was unique , adding : ‘ our creative team was n’t aware of @entity2 … the stories are very different			2
fortunately for our bear , all the characters in the @entity3 ad love @entity2			0

the department store took £ 101million in the week after advert first aired
