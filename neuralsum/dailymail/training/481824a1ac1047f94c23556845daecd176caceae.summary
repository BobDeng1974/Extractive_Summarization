by @entity0 published : 13:30 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 22 january 2013 when the first official portrait of the @entity3 was unveiled at the @entity4 a fortnight ago it was greeted with a global eyebrow - raise you could practically hear			1
though @entity3 herself , 31 , said @entity10 's likeness of her was ' amazing ' and ' brilliant ' , and her husband @entity11 told the artist it was ' absolutely beautiful ' , critics dismissed it as unflattering , ageing and even ' rotten '			1
now @entity10 has bitten back at his critics , saying the aftermath of its unveiling felt like a ' witch hunt ' , but that there is still ' nothing i would have changed ' about his painting			1
@entity10 with his portrait of the @entity3 speaking to @entity25 , he said : ' some of the words written about it were so personal			1
i 'd be inhuman if i said it did n't affect me			0
when you take on commissions like this it is hazardous and you expect a bit of flak , but i expected nothing like the criticism i have received			0
i did n't expect it to go to the levels it did			0
' it felt like a bit of a witch hunt and people who have not even seen my portrait joined in with what quickly became a circus			2
the worst thing is it was not only destructive to me , but particularly upsetting for my two daughters and my wife			0
' he added : ' at first the attacks were so vicious that there was a point where i myself doubted that the portrait of the @entity57 was any good			2
but now , i 've had time to reflect , i am still happy with it and am getting on with my life			0
there is nothing i would have changed			0
' the @entity57 and @entity3 told @entity10 , pictured with the couple , that they were thrilled with the painting @entity10 working on the painting in his studio , left , and meeting the @entity3 after the unveiling in the @entity4 , right @entity10 says that the praise of the @entity57 and @entity3 meant more to him ' than anything else said or written ' , but that he would urge people to visit the @entity4 since he feels ' half the problem is that the portrait does n't photograph well '			1
according to the gallery , the number of people visiting since the painting went on display on 11 january has risen from 24,000 over that weekend , up nfrom 17,000 the week before			1
the @entity78 reported that postcards of the portrait are the fastest - selling item in the history of the gallery 's permanent collection			0
@entity85 appeared to be showing the first signs of a baby bump as she was photographed outside the gallery @entity3 arrives at the gallery with prince @entity11			2
the baby is likely to be moving about but its movements will be too small for @entity3 to feel them just yet			2
