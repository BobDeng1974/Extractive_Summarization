only once did @entity0 pause for breath in @entity2 8 on thursday			1
nothing else fazed ' @entity4 ' on a @entity6 gig in the shadow of @entity8			2
not @entity10 's managerial qualities , his relationship with @entity12 , @entity14 ' role at @entity15 , where @entity16 should play , or @entity18 's future			2
no. the only question which caused him to puff his cheeks and buy time , was a simple one : are @entity23 a better team with @entity24 , or without ? @entity0 is pictured in @entity2 on thursday as he spoke about @entity23 vs @entity25 with @entity25 docking at @entity28 on sunday , and @entity24 – or @entity24 as @entity0 called him - available after injury , the query was relevant			1
' i think any @entity23 team with @entity24 is going to be better , not just from a footballing point of view but a leadership point of view , ' he said			1
' @entity24 is like a comfort blanket			1
when he is in your team you feel comfortable , you think ' oh good , @entity24 is there			1
' ' when @entity24 is not in the @entity23 team , players worry			1
but when they see him leading them out , they feel alright , ' we 've got our leader here			2
' ' they 've won without him , done well , but sunday is one of those games where you need your men , your warriors , and that 's what @entity24 is			1
' whether @entity23 manager @entity54 feels the same remains to be seen but @entity0 is adamant @entity24 should play			1
' if i was manager , i 'd pick him , ' he said			2
with or without @entity24 , @entity0 feels @entity23 have a slight edge			1
@entity24 ( right ) puts in a tackle on @entity60 's @entity59 at the @entity61 on monday night ' if you 'd asked me a couple of weeks ago i 'd have said a comfortable win for @entity23 , now , i think there 's a bit more to it as @entity25 were more like the old @entity25 against @entity68			1
' @entity23 are flying and are really strong at home , and i think they will win			2
' not that a swallow will make a summer for a club without a championship since 1990			2
' the only way @entity23 will overtake @entity25 is to start winning titles again , ' acknowledged @entity0			1
@entity0 is out of management since @entity76 showed him the door 14 months ago , but 45 minutes in his company left the impression he could do a decent job for any number of clubs			1
@entity83 , engaging , informative , @entity0 covered almost as much ground as he did in a distinguished playing career which spanned 20 seasons , eight of which he spent at @entity25 , where he won plenty , and @entity23 , where he won nothing			1
at that time , @entity0 reckoned everyone wanted to play for those two clubs , but now they ' ai n't the big giants anymore			1
' ' we 're not talking about two teams fighting for the title , we 're talking about two teams fighting for @entity98 football			0
' @entity0 feels that @entity23 are a better team with @entity24 as he looked ahead to sunday 's match at @entity28 ' if @entity102 were playing @entity103 the same day we 'd be talking about those two giants instead			1
' while building up @entity10 as a contender to manage @entity25 in the future , he does n't believe @entity14 can succeed @entity108			2
' absolutely no chance , ' he said			0
' @entity14 's my mate and he enjoyed last year , he loved it			0
and now under @entity108 he 's learning			0
but i said to @entity14 , ' you got ta go to a club to get experience			0
go manage a @entity116 side or @entity118 side or because you 're @entity14 you might get a @entity120 team			2
' ' you ca n't just throw him into @entity25 , one of the biggest clubs in the world and say ' there ya go @entity14			1
' he 's not ready for that			0
' ' why would you put @entity14 in a situation where if he does n't succeed you have to sack him ? ' learn from @entity108 and then go out and find your own feet			0
then come back and say ' i 've done five or six years			0
' that 's how i see the road for @entity14			0
' @entity25 assistant manager @entity14 ( left ) speaks with @entity16 during the @entity134 sixth round match against @entity135 last week @entity0 took that route , starting off at @entity137 and working his way to the @entity139 in just two years at @entity140 , where he became the first black manager in the top flight			1
he has n't made it back there again , and been out of work grates			0
' you ca n't just say ' i 'm @entity10 ' or ' i 'm @entity0 ' and wait for someone to come			2
it does n't work like that			0
you 've got to put your cv in			0
' i do n't want to go to a firefighting job			0
i want a three - year project , where you can build and try to be successful			0
' @entity0 retains the coltish enthusiasm of the tearaway teenager who broke through at @entity158 under @entity159 in the late 80s where he played beside @entity161 – for so long @entity163 's comfort blanket			1
@entity0 ( left ) is pictured speaking to son @entity164 during his days in charge of @entity76 in september 2013 ' i was watching @entity166 last night on tv and i could n't believe i played with him			1
am i that old ? surely not , but what a player , ' he smiled			0
' @entity161 was n't quick anyway and he was even slower at @entity158			0
but he had a wonderful , cultured left foot and his mind was so far in front of anyone else			0
' ' i was only 18 - 19 and thinking ' move over , old man i 'm taking over ' but he would flick the ball around the corners and get it back			0
he taught me a lesson			0
' then , just like today , the top flight of @entity179 football had room for outstanding 34 - year - olds			0
it 's still a place for old men , like @entity24			2
