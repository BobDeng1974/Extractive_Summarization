by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has expressed his dismay at what he perceives to be a ' fixation ' and ' agenda ' towards @entity8 team - mate @entity7			1
the @entity10 striker has come under some scrutiny since @entity8 ’s 2 - 1 defeat against @entity13 in their @entity15 opener last saturday			1
despite providing the assist for @entity17 to score with an inch - perfect cross and being played out of position on the left wing , @entity7 was criticised after a largely indifferent display			1
video : scroll down to see @entity8 prepare for @entity23 at their @entity25 training base fixation : @entity7 is suffering from the pressure of an ' agenda ' from @entity30 media and fans according to @entity2 team - mates : @entity7 and @entity2 have been @entity8 team - mates for over a decade gaffer : @entity34 leads his @entity8 team in a training session in @entity25 all smiles : @entity38 is back in full training and hoping to be fit to play a part against @entity23 @entity41 : @entity8 will be hoping to recover from their opening defeat to @entity13 @entity8 boss @entity34 defended @entity7 immediately after the game , but the 28 - year - old has continued to be a hot topic of conversation among fans and the media			1
veteran @entity2 , an unused substitute in @entity49 , admitted his frustration at much of the focus centring on just one player			1
he said : ' unfortunately we do have a fixation with one player during every @entity15 , ones that i ’ve been involved in			2
' it ’s a bit frustrating when you ’re in a team group and that happens because we ’re there trying to play together - people are not selfish in this squad - trying to get results and a fixation with one player can become , rather than a debate , a bit of an agenda			1
' so i do think we need to drop the agenda and look at the team , whoever plays , because the manager will pick the best team that he sees fit and whoever plays we want to win the game			2
' @entity2 believes @entity34 ’s men can take heart from their performance against the @entity13 , but knows that it will count for nothing unless they win against @entity23 on thursday and then @entity81 next week			1
' i thought we started very bright , some good attacking football , there were a lot of positives out of the game , the one negative was that we did n’t win it , ' he said			0
' importantly now ( we must ) look forward , take those good points , try and keep them going and improve on them			0
we need to win games			0
' assisted : @entity7 celebrating with goalscorer @entity17 after providing him with the cross for @entity8 's equaliser against @entity13 partners : many believe that @entity7 should be played centrally alongside @entity17 , rather than on the left several youngsters came to the fore over the weekend and @entity2 hailed the likes of @entity101 , @entity17 and @entity102 as a breath of fresh air			1
' ( the younger players have had ) a big impact			0
from the minute the manager picked the squad i think we were all quite excited by the youth , ' he added			0
' with @entity8 we ’ve been crying out for some youthful exuberance and attacking play , and the lads have brought that			2
not just in the game against @entity13 , but in training			2
' it ’s great to watch and great to see			0
i think they ’re all very ready now to make their impression			0
' young gun : @entity101 was one of @entity8 's impressive youngsters on the night trademark : as was @entity17 , who was preferred to @entity7 in a central role @entity101 , in particular , earned rave reviews on just his fifth appearance for the senior team and the 19 - year - old revealed he was keen to showcase his talents to the world			1
' i was a bit nervous at the time but i just thought to myself it was a great opportunity to show the footballing world what i can do , and hopefully i showed some glimpses and helped my team to try and do the best that we could , ' he said			0
' it was unlucky that we did n’t get the win but i thought we played some good stuff at times			0
on thursday we ’ll be going at it again			0
