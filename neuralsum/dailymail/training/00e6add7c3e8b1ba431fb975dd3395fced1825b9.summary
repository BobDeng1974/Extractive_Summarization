ready ? set ? go crazy			0
most @entity1 ' 2014 tax returns are due in 14 weeks , and the @entity2 is trying to cope with reams of new @entity5 regulations with a lengthy instruction manual that 's likely to send countless taxpayers sprinting toward accountants and other tax preparers			1
the manual , called ' @entity11 – @entity12 : what ’s new for @entity14 , ' is 21 pages long and written with all the compassion of a mediaeval dentist			1
its central instruction , though , is simple : either prove you have medical insurance that satisfies the @entity5 , or prove you have an exemption			1
otherwise , calculate how much extra you owe in taxes			0
@entity24 to read the manual , if you dare @entity26 is 21 pages long and written with all the compassion of a mediaeval dentist he 's got a plan : president @entity30 pledged to lower the cost of health insurance but the end result of @entity5 may be a boom year for professional tax preparers @entity36 : can you decipher these examples from the @entity2 ? they 're included in the tax agency 's latest effort to make @entity5 penalties easier to document the examples the @entity2 provides are about as digestible as the thousands of pages that make up the law itself , or the tens of thousands of pages of regulations it has spawned			1
and they require the use of a four - page glossary of terms , definitions and acronyms just to understand it all			1
forget the obvious ones like @entity58 ( @entity58 ) and @entity59 ( @entity59 )			0
this year @entity1 need to know about @entity60 ( @entity61 ) and @entity62 ( @entity63 )			1
there 's also the @entity65 , which stands for the ' second lowest cost silver plan			2
' that 's the benchmark insurance plan available in each zip code that the government uses to calculate the maximum allowable tax credit anyone can claim for paying their premiums			1
the ' @entity74 ' ( @entity74 ) is another critical number			0
that figure , the @entity2 says , ' is used in calculating the shared responsibility payment ( @entity78 )			1
' it helps to know what the shared responsibility payment is , too			0
that 's the new tax			1
and then comes the switcheroo : ' a table of @entity74 amounts can be found in the @entity86 , @entity88 , and in @entity89 , @entity5 tab			1
' this is where tax filers reach for a bottle – either @entity94 or bourbon			2
reprinted from @entity11 – can you understand it ? how is the premium tax credit claimed on the tax return ? only taxpayers who purchased qualified health plans from the @entity102 may be eligible for the premium tax credit			1
eligible taxpayers claim the premium tax credit on their federal income tax return			1
taxpayers who received the benefit of advance credit payments must file a federal income tax return even if they otherwise are not required to file			1
on form 8962 , @entity109 , a taxpayer must subtract the advance credit payments for the year from the amount of the taxpayer ’s premium tax credit calculated on the tax return			2
if the premium tax credit computed on the return is more than the advance credit payments made on the taxpayer ’s behalf during the year , the difference will increase the refund or lower the amount of tax owed			2
this will be reported in the payments section of form 1040			0
if the advance credit payments are more than the premium tax credit ( an excess advance credit payment ) , the difference will increase the amount owed and result in either a smaller refund or a balance due			2
this will be entered in the @entity134 section of the return			0
there may be a limitation on the amount of tax liability a taxpayer owes as a result of an excess advance credit payment			2
the limitation is based on the taxpayer ’s household income			0
for taxpayers with household income below 400 percent of the @entity59 , the amount of tax liability due to excess advance credit payments is limited as provided in the repayment limitation table			1
@entity150 ... @entity151 ... @entity152 ! new @entity2 forms will meet broken pencils and green eyeshades this year , including a dense worksheet required of everyone who wants credit for paying their insurance premiums ' @entity162 is single , has no dependents and lives in @entity165 , ' one example begins			1
' when he enrolled through the marketplace , @entity162 was approved for advance credit payments based on his projected 2014 household income of $ 39,095			0
the applicable figure for his household income is .095			0
@entity162 enrolled in a qualified health plan			0
the applicable @entity65 is $ 5,200			0
' understand so far ? no ? no matter			2
' @entity162 ’s form 1095 - a shows advance credit payments of $ 1,486			2
@entity162 ’s actual modified @entity58 for 2014 was $ 46,000 , which is more than the @entity59 limit shown in @entity89 , @entity5 tab ( more than 400 % of the @entity59 for a family of 1 )			1
' you do have a copy of @entity179 handy , right ? ' since @entity162 ’s household income is above 400 % of the @entity59 , he may not claim any premium tax credit , and must increase his tax liability by the amount of his advance credit payments			0
@entity162 will complete form 8962 and enter $ 1,486 on the excess advance premium tax credit repayment line on his tax return			0
' and then @entity162 will seek therapy , or a job where his employer provides health insurance			0
for those people , the 21 pages do n't matter			0

lengthy and *impersonal* ' @entity11 ' is now available as @entity1 grapple with @entity5 's impact on their annual tax returns
includes 4 - page glossary of terms and acronyms taxpayers need to understand because of the @entity5
*boiled* down : get medical insurance , prove you are n't required to , or pay a new tax
some example *scenarios* in the @entity2 manual are more than 150 words long , use *confusing* *language* and refer taxpayers to still more instructions
