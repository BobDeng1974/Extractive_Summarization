in @entity2 , the group has formed an alliance of sorts with fellow @entity10 militants as well as former members of former dictator @entity13 's @entity262 , with all of them hoping to overthrow @entity157 's @entity22 - led government			1
the militants have tapped into deep - seated discontent among @entity2 's @entity9 , who largely dominated the country until the @entity95 - led overthrow of @entity13 brought the @entity22 majority to power			1
