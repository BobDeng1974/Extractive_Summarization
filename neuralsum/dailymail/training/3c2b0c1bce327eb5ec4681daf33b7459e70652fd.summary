by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 30 september 2013 the distraught teenage sister of @entity2 said today she dreams of hugging her murdered sibling just one more time and to hear her say ' i love you '			1
@entity7 and the five - year - old were ' inseparable ' and the room they shared is exactly as it was when she was abducted and killed last october			1
april 's bed in @entity13 , @entity14 , is still made and is covered in her favourite cuddly toys to remind her bereft family ' she will always be with us ' , the 17 - year - old said			1
tragic : april @entity19 's sister @entity18 ( right ) said today she was desperate to hug the five - year - old just one more time and hear her say ' i love you ' ' i wish i could feel her hug me or hear her voice say " i love you " just one more time , ' @entity18 told @entity25 april was kidnapped and murdered by @entity2 , who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on october 1 last year			1
but @entity18 has admitted she wishes she had been there to protect her sibling			0
' i could n't do anything that night			0
i kept thinking it ca n't be april — it must be a joke , ' she said			2
bereft : april 's funeral was last thursday , which saw her parents coral , @entity40 , and siblings @entity41 and @entity18 cling to one another for support outpouring : april 's family file into church behind her coffin while the community in @entity13 , @entity14 , stand and watch before he killed april , paedophile @entity50 had stalked local girls online and police found pictures of children , including @entity18 , on his computer			1
but the student said today : ' i do n't think of him			0
my mind is always on april			0
' it came just four days since april @entity19 's family were finally able to say a formal farewell to their ‘ sweet , innocent little girl ’			2
her mother coral sobbed with grief as she joined hundreds of mourners at april 's funeral in @entity13 last thursday			1
cruel : @entity2 ( left ) , who was convicted of april 's murder in may , has never revealed where her body is coral , her husband @entity40 , and children @entity18 and @entity41 , 10 , dressed in april 's favourite colour of pink for the touching funeral service			1
the tight - knit town in @entity14 came to a standstill as the youngster ’s tiny coffin made its final journey from her home to the packed church where her funeral was held			1
pure grief : april 's mother coral sobbed as she entered the church , wearing a bracelet bearing her daughter 's name the horse - drawn carriage was filled with pink flowers that spelled out april 's name			1
it sat alongside a small golden crown and a card from her parents and siblings that read : ' shine bright like a diamond			0
find happiness with the angels april			0
' as the family arrived , a poignant montage of images of april played on a 50inch flat screen tv taken from the family 's own album of images			2
the images were put together as part of a gcse school project by @entity18			0
@entity13 , which has stood behind the family throughout the trauma , was also decorated in the five - year - old 's favourite colour of pink and ribbons were hung from railings , shop windows and lampposts			1
it is very nearly a year since april was snatched as she played just a few yards from her terraced home			2
the youngster had been allowed to stay out a little later than usual following a glowing report from teachers at her primary school			0
it was then that the father - of - six @entity50 conned april , who was friends with one of his daughters , into his @entity136 before speeding off			2
he then fled back to his remote cottage in @entity138 , where it is thought april suffered a violent death			0
despite a mountain of evidence stacking up against the former abattoir worker , including fragments of a child ’s skull in his fireplace , @entity50 vehemently claimed he could not remember what he had done with april			0
following a month long trial at @entity151 , a jury rejected his lies and a judge sentenced him to a whole life tariff .			0

@entity7 , 17 , said she dreams of hugging her youngest sibling again
room they shared is *untouched* , with april 's bed made and covered in toys
' i see it as a happy thing , she has n't *disappeared* . she *'ll* always be with us . '

the five - year - old was laid to rest last thursday in @entity13 , @entity14
