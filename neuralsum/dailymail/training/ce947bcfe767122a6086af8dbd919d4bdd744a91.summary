@entity0 dances with his investor @entity1 on @entity4 's @entity3 it 's the programme where millions see aspiring entrepreneurs pitch to win over some of @entity8 ’s most demanding financial backers			1
to viewers of @entity11 ’s @entity10 ’ den it would seem obvious that contestants have already fought a fierce battle to win a place on the show			1
but now one former contestant has lifted the lid on the @entity11 ’s selection process , saying he was first headhunted and then cajoled into taking part			1
and @entity21 has since learned that he is far from alone – with nearly half the contestants on the current @entity11 series , 46 out of 97 , having been similarly targeted			2
@entity0 , who runs a swing dancing school , made his astounding revelation about the ‘ selection ’ process on his company website			1
the 48 - year - old says he was contacted out of the blue by the @entity11 and ‘ talked into ’ an audition			1
for mr @entity0 , who appeared on the opening episode of the 12th series with members of his dance company , @entity35 , taking part could not have been more straightforward			1
once he bowed to the @entity11 ’s entreaties , his only problem , he said , was having just ten days ‘ to think about what on earth to ask for ’ , as he was happy with his business as it was and was n’t seeking investment			2
first , he held an urgent meeting with his accountant			0
‘ i memorised my figures and got to understand my business a lot better			0
that ’s an area i neglect because it bores me , ’ he said			0
then came his pitch : a swing nightclub			0
he entered the den dancing with six members of his troupe and invited the @entity10 to join them			2
his idea was dismissed by all the @entity10 – including @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity1			2
but , as mr @entity0 recognises , it made for a lively start to the new series , presumably what the producers intended			1
‘ they thought we would be a good balance for the tv because obviously the @entity11 want to put on a good show , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
and despite the resistance to his nightclub plan , mrs @entity1 – a former @entity72 contestant – was impressed with the business generally , investing £ 65,000 in return for a 20 per cent stake			1
the next morning , she danced with mr @entity0 on @entity4 ’s @entity3 and spoke enthusiastically about the venture			2
in a video on his website , which has now been taken down , mr @entity0 said : ‘ when i spoke to him [ the @entity11 researcher ] he asked if i would consider going on the show			1
i was really surprised ; apparently lots of people put in application forms but they hand - pick certain groups			0
they talked me into doing a screen test and i took some dancers and we went to @entity101			0
they said , “ we ’d love you to do it			0
” the only catch was i had ten days to be in front of the actual @entity10			0
after some consideration , i decided to go for it			0
’ credited with bringing dances such as the @entity105 into the mainstream , @entity35 teaches 1,200 students every week at 27 venues across @entity101 and has featured on @entity109 and @entity110			2
the practice has been greeted with dismay by other contestants			0
former contestant @entity114 , co-owner of @entity115 , a celebrity facemask company based in @entity117 , @entity118 , said it was deceptive			2
‘ we applied through the normal channels and i was not aware of these approaches			0
it is less entrepreneurial if you are cajoled into it			0
‘ the perception of the viewer is that the business pitching to the @entity10 has gone about it in a normal manner by approaching the show , not the show approaching them			0
’ a @entity11 source admitted that mr @entity0 had been approached directly but said the producers dispute he was cajoled			1
the @entity11 said : ‘ as is made clear on the @entity10 ’ @entity136 website , in order to showcase a wide cross-section of business ideas , there are many different ways that our production team source entrepreneurs and businesses to apply to take part			1
‘ regardless of this , every applicant , without exception , goes through the same rigorous application and audition process			0
’ the 48 - year - old says he was contacted out of the blue by the @entity11 and ‘ talked into ’ an audition for @entity136			1
