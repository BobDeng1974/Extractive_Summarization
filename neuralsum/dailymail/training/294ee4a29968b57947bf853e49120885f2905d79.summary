' i thought i would do something ironic and that it would make everyone smile			0
' there were a lot of people there and i thought they 'd all love it if i took a selfie			2

heading for a fall : art graduate @entity5 , 22 , above , fell over in front of hundreds of people just seconds after she took this selfie oops : her enormous heels buckle and she finds herself falling to the floor as fellow students rush to help ' i 'd worn them before but this time i was n't wearing any socks underneath so that 's probably why my feet gave way because there was nothing for them to grip			1
' once you start falling there 's no going back			0
it was horrible and i could feel everyone watching me			0
' when i fell down i just did n't know what to do for a split second			0
it all happened so quick and it was so embarrassing , but at least i saw the funny side later			0

but i got everyone in behind it - it 's definitely a picture worth keeping			2
