she was a clever , cheerful and creative girl with a talent for dance and huge potential			0
she will be sadly missed by all those who knew her			0
' the family now request the media leave them to grieve and respect their privacy			0
' campaigners today called on the government and internet companies to do more to prevent young people accessing harmful websites			1

' her good - natured charm , kind manner and sweet sense of humour will be deeply missed			2
we feel for her family and are thinking of them at this very difficult time			0

' a spokeswoman for eating disorder charity beat said : ' our heart goes out to @entity33 ’s family at the loss of such a young life			0
pro-anorexia sites , although not directly a cause of an eating disorder can be particularly dangerous in that they encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are			0
' they also encourage people to avoid treatment			0
' there is no internationally enforceable legislation in this area and indeed many of these sites are run by young people who are ill and we are not sure what purpose it would serve to criminalise someone with a serious mental illness			0

' it is important that organisations which run sites that are highly popular with young people develop responsible practices around suicide - related content , including promoting sources of support and by removing content which actively encourages or glorifies self harm or suicide			1
' however , we also know that many people find emotional support by using online forums , blogs and social networking sites to discuss feelings of distress and despair and so the right balance has to be struck to make sure that legitimate online dialogue about suicidal feelings is not prohibited			2
' @entity0 - @entity147 , ceo of @entity148 said : ' we know from our research that young people are alarmed by the number of self - harm and suicide sites they encounter in their cyber lives and for young people who become engaged in these sites they can be incredibly damaging and have devastating consequences			1
' much is being done , by various organisations and children themselves , but the government and the internet industry must take the issue of keeping children safe online more seriously			0
it is clear that we can not afford to wait any longer for this to happen			0
' loved : the head of @entity62 in @entity16 said @entity17 ' was already a very popular member of our community ' , despite only having been at the school for a few weeks @entity172 , nicknamed @entity173 , had sung in the junior choir at the parish church of @entity176 in @entity16 , where news of her death was announced to worshippers at @entity181 on sunday			1
