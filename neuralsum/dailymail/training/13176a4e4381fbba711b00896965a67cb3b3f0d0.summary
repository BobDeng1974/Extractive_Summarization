by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 09:14 est , 16 october 2013 it 's the @entity3 phenomenon that makes parents shudder and puts teachers in a tizzy			0
now @entity7 , an online trend that began in the @entity9 , has been turned into a play			1
the brainchild of artist @entity13 , @entity11 charts her foray into the world of pretty / ugly videos in which girls , most of whom are in their early teens , post clips of themselves and ask viewers to tell them whether or not they 're good - looking			1
unsurprisingly , some of the comments are cruel in the extreme and even more worryingly , many of the clearly under - age girls are propositioned by men - nearly all of whom are well past the age of 18			1
underneath the video , more than 12,000 comments have been submitted ranging from the concerned ( ' you are asking for paedos ' ) to the approving ( ' @entity54 made you beautiful ' ) and the downright nasty ( ' ugly as f * * * ' )			1
@entity56 is no stranger to this sort of comment herself , having experimented by putting three different pretty / ugly videos - all differently styled - on the site			1
' i got torrents of abuse , ' revealed the 26 - year - old artist in an interview with @entity68			2
blog : @entity13 has now launched a website and blog detailing her experiences in the @entity7 ? world ' people were telling me to f * * * off and die			1
i woke up and read all of this abuse and i really felt it in my stomach			0
i had to remind myself that it 's not me , it 's the character			0
' her new show , which will top the billing at the @entity83 from the 23rd october until the 5th november , is based on her experiences and begins with her posing the pretty / ugly question to the audience			2
it is , she argues , important to try and understand what 's going on and where the desire to be judged on your looks comes from			0
' now if you look on @entity96 , @entity3 , @entity97 , it 's not the media , but the teenage girls themselves perpetuating this myth [ of beauty ]			1
worrying : many of the comments posted below the videos are cruel or have inappropriate content ' they are resharing these images , reblogging			1
there 's always going to be peer pressure but i think [ social media ] makes these issues worse			0
' and to stop it ? the answer , she concludes , is not stricter parental locks but getting girls to take more responsibility for themselves			2
' it 's about changing attitudes towards things and teaching girls to take responsibility for themselves online			2
' you can only hope that her play and blog succeed in persuading them to do so			0
see @entity128 from 23 october to 5 november			0
