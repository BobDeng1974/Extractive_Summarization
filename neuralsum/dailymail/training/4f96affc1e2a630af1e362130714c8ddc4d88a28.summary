@entity0 had a night to forget as @entity1 remain rooted to the bottom of the @entity3 following a 3 - 1 loss at home to @entity6 on tuesday night			1
@entity0 endured a torrid display against the @entity9 ' attack before being sent off for hauling down @entity10 in the second half			1
in contrast , his opposing skipper @entity12 put in fine performance as @entity6 's mini-revival continued			1
the 34 - year - old gave his side a 2 - 1 lead with a trademark finish , to cap a brilliant display against the @entity3 newcomers			0
@entity23 's @entity22 was at the @entity24 to provide his match ratings			0
@entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity26 5 glaring error for the third goal , and should have given a penalty away after bringing down @entity12			1
@entity30 5 dealt well with @entity31 , but final ball should have been better			0
@entity0 4 sent off and looked sloppy all evening			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 ( right ) was shown a straight red card for a second half foul on @entity10 referee @entity35 ( centre ) had no doubts in his mind that @entity0 ( right ) was the last man after his foul @entity40 5.5 stood up to @entity10 and impressed with physicality			1
@entity42 5 solid but it ’s no wonder his former employers let him go … @entity45 ( centre ) was busy against @entity6 but lacked a killer ball in the final third to hurt their defence @entity45 5 cut in well from the right - hand side but again final ball was lacking			0
@entity53 5.5 classy in midfield and still possesses that engine			0
@entity57 5 good industry but @entity12 got away from him at times			2
@entity57 ( right ) showed good industry at times in @entity1 's midfield on tuesday night against @entity6 @entity62 5 good pace down the left but was n’t in the game enough			2
@entity66 5.5 ran his socks off and troubled @entity68 and @entity69 in behind			0
@entity70 6.5 great play for the opener and kept the defenders occupied			0
@entity70 ( right ) was key in @entity1 's opener and kept the visiting defenders on their toes throughout subs @entity78 5 replaced @entity42 with 10 minutes to go but had little time to make an impact			2
@entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity81 5.5 had another poor game , scoring an own goal and should have been punished by @entity53 for a sloppy clearance prior to that			1
@entity81 ( bottom ) scored an own goal to see @entity6 go 1 - 0 behind at @entity24 @entity88 5 failed to impress in the first half and was replaced at half - time by @entity91			1
@entity68 6 solid in defence overall but looked nervous when @entity1 pressed for an equaliser			2
@entity69 6 a decent performance from the veteran defender who deserves to keep @entity97 out of the team on current form			0
@entity100 6 decent outlet going forward for the visitors , but lost possession that led to the hosts opener			2
@entity105 ( left ) scored @entity6 's third goal in their 3 - 1 victory at the @entity24 on tuesday @entity108 7 industrious in midfield as always and took his goal well			1
@entity111 7 solid anchor in @entity6 's midfield which gave the defence extra stability			0
@entity116 7 took his goal really well in what was arguably his best performance in a @entity9 shirt			1
@entity116 ( centre ) scored @entity6 's equaliser in the first half with a sweetly - struck left - footed strike @entity12 8 - star man who says the @entity6 skipper is a fading force ? scored the goal to give @entity6 the lead with a trademark finish			1
@entity31 7 another good performance from the @entity133 winger who was involved in everything positive they did			0
@entity10 7 provided the knockdown for @entity116 's goal			1
seems to be growing more and more as a @entity6 player			0
@entity12 celebrates scoring @entity6 's second goal with a trademark finish subs @entity91 5 came on at half - time for the ineffective @entity88 but failed to make a major impact			1
@entity144 5 replaced @entity116 with 15 minutes remaining but was largely anonymous			2
@entity97 came on in the 90th minute			0
had no time to make any contribution .			0

@entity116 , @entity12 and @entity108 all scored to seal visitors *comeback* win
