the charity race at @entity1 is supposed to be all about the taking part - except when serial winners sir @entity4 and multi-champion trainer @entity5 are involved			1
co-owner @entity4 and @entity5 were so keen for the ditcheat trainer ’s head lad @entity6 to ride the winner that his fancied mount @entity9 , who cost £ 100,000 , had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the @entity1 card yesterday			1
the regulations , confirmed by a @entity1 spokeswoman , state that horses in the line - up should all have been given an average @entity22 rating to ensure a competitive race			0
sir @entity4 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) were at @entity1 to watch @entity9 finish fifth yet @entity9 , who is highly thought of in the @entity5 yard , had no @entity22 rating , and rival jockeys were concerned that @entity4 ’s horse was far superior to the rest of the field			1
the get - out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by @entity1 at their discretion			0
in the event , @entity9 finished an outpaced fifth , having led for most of the 1m 5f			1
@entity5 said : ‘ of course we wanted to win			0
but it ’s a charity race and we entered to give @entity6 a ride			2
’ @entity44 , who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of @entity48 fixtures , still chose to hold their annual drinks party during @entity1 , even though it is not one of their tracks			1
@entity44 are owned by the @entity53 , the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse @entity56 and moving its meetings to the over-raced @entity60 and @entity61 tracks			0
@entity56 is now empty most of the time as part of a long - term property play between the local council and the @entity53 , who are never seen at the races			0
@entity44 were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at @entity1 it does n’t say much for the commitment to developing homegrown cricket talent that @entity78 selector @entity77 , in his other role as @entity75 ’s director of cricket , has signed @entity80 batsman @entity79 as a @entity82 player			1
the 29 - year - old has played 23 tests and 166 odis			0
the move follows another @entity78 selector , @entity88 boss @entity87 , bringing in new zealander @entity89 on an @entity91 passport			2
minister for sport @entity92 is a guest of the @entity22 and @entity95 at @entity1 today			0
but @entity96 , a modest drinker , is unlikely to embrace the liquid @entity1 hospitality as heartily as one of her predecessors did last year			0
the former minister was barely able to walk through the car parks after the meeting			0
minister for sport @entity92 , a modest drinker , is unlikely to end up like a predecessor at @entity1 @entity107 back in fat cat mode @entity107 chief executive @entity109 has yet to justify an annual salary and benefits package of £ 434,000 plus a massive one - off relocation payment of £ 190,000			1
nor did the @entity113 do his image much good by wearing a @entity116 tracksuit top during last weekend ’s @entity118 triumph over the @entity119 in @entity120 — a cardinal sin for a sports administrator			1
@entity107 chairman @entity123 had said @entity109 would receive a £ 300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the @entity129 regime are already in danger of being repeated			2
@entity107 chief executive @entity109 was not his usual suited self in @entity120 - he wore a @entity116 tracksuit top there will be only five more racing days after saturday before @entity135 turns her back on presenting the sport following @entity138			1
but the @entity135 effect has not boosted @entity141 ’s viewing figures — quite the reverse			1
the @entity1 peak of 996,000 was down again on wednesday , year on year , by 20,000			0
and the last time @entity1 enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m - plus ratings was pre-balding in 2012 , when @entity145 produced the coverage and @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 were all still on board			0
@entity135 arrives at @entity1 , but her presence has not helped viewing figures only @entity1 could consider £ 30,000 for two season tickets in the @entity155 good value			1
however , 100 of the 300 memberships available for the grand top - floor facility in the new £ 45million grandstand , which are being sold on a minimum three - year basis , have already been bought			2
and that ’s where @entity161 will be found at @entity1 next year , having been signed up as the @entity95 ambassador			2
@entity161 will be among those in the @entity155 next year , having signed up to be its ambassador			0

sir @entity4 and @entity5 - owned exploited grey areas of *eligility* for @entity9 to ride in the charity race at @entity1
but @entity9 led most of the 1m 5f before finishing an outpaced fifth
@entity44 hold their annual drinks at @entity1 despite it not being one of the 40 per cent of tracks they own in the country
@entity78 selector @entity77 has signed @entity80 batsman @entity79 as a *kolpak* player in his @entity75 role
a former minister had trouble walking *due* to drink at @entity1 last year
@entity107 chief @entity109 committed a sports administrator cardinal sin
@entity135 *'s* presence has not boosted @entity141 ’s viewing figures
a third of £ 30,000 memberships in the @entity155 have been sold
