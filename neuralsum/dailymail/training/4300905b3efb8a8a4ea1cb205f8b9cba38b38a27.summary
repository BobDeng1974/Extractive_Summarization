by @entity0 last updated at 11:44 pm on 24th november 2011 as one of the @entity4 ’s most skilful generals , he fought on the frontline of some of the bloodiest napoleonic wars and was the highest ranking officer to die at the @entity9			0
so it is perhaps unsurprising that , to celebrate lieutenant general sir @entity14 ’s military heroism , a large portrait of the @entity11 hangs inside the court house in @entity16 , @entity17			1
but today it emerged that a row has broken out about the painting , which lawyers claim is offensive and should not be displayed behind the judge ’s chair in @entity24			1
they say sir @entity14 ’s reputation as a cruel and brutal colonial governor – he was military governor of @entity29 at the turn of the 19th century , where he was accused of torturing a young slave girl - mean his image should not be associated with modern equality and justice			1
the portrait of sir @entity14 , lawyers say sir @entity14 's reputation as a cruel and brutal colonial governor - he was military governor of @entity29 at the turn of the 19th century , where he was accused of torturing a young slave girl - mean his image should not be associated with modern equality and justice pride of place : the painting has hung above the judge 's chair at @entity16 court house for the last 182 years sir @entity14 was born in @entity45 , @entity46 in 1758			1
in 1771 at the tender age of just 13 , he was commissioned to enlist in the 12th regiment which was commanded by his uncle			0
@entity50 ( above ) played the role of sir @entity14 in the 1970 film ' @entity9 '			1
sir @entity14 was leading the @entity54 infantry in civilian clothing - and carrying his umbrella - when a @entity58 musket - ball penetrated his top hat and killed him instantly he first saw active service in @entity61 in 1796 , shortly after which he served as governor of @entity29			1
it was during his tenure as governor in the @entity67 that he acquired both a reputation for having a violent temperament and respect for courageously leading troops into battle			2
he is chiefly remembered for serving under the @entity4 in the @entity73 and at the @entity9			0
he became the most senior @entity54 officer to die when a @entity58 musket - ball penetrated his top hat and killed him instantly			2
sir @entity14 was leading the @entity54 infantry in civilian clothing - and carrying his umbrella - at the time , due to his uniform having failed to reach him			1
however , @entity79 , who own the 8ft x 4ft portrait , disagree and say it was specifically commissioned for the court house , where it has lived for the past 182 years , and should stay			0
criminal lawyer @entity84 , who is among those calling for the painting to be taken down , said : ' i appreciate the painting for historical purposes and that he ( @entity14 ) was a figure of note			1
' but i find it very offensive that someone who was not only a known slaver , but also allegedly tortured a slave , should have his picture in a place where the values of justice are served			2
' it ’s fair to say he has a murky past and it is inappropriate to have his picture in a modern court of law , where we are supposed to represent the principles of equality and justice for all			2
' i think people might misread the prominence of the picture as saying he has done something worthwhile to contribute towards justice , which really is n't the case			2
' sir @entity14 , who was born in @entity45 , @entity46 , in 1758 , was appointed military governor of @entity29 following the @entity54 victory in 1797 where he oversaw the production of sugar by slaves on the island ’s plantations			1
but he operated a brutally authoritarian regime which lead to accusations of slave torture , false imprisonment and execution			2
in 1806 he was called back to @entity54 and faced trial in @entity127 over claims he authorised the torture of a 13 - year - old girl , @entity130 , who was accused of robbery , by forcing her to stand on a sharpened wooden peg while suspended from the ceiling			1
this form of torture was dubbed ' pictoning ' at the trial and , although he was found guilty , sir @entity14 later overturned his conviction on appeal and went on to resume his military career			1
his greatest successes came in @entity140 , where he was instrumental in the @entity141 , helping @entity4 eventually claim victory in the @entity143			0
sir @entity14 was killed after being was shot through the temple by a musket ball at the @entity9 , where , @entity147 folklore contends , he fought in his top hat and tails because his uniform had not arrived at the frontline in time			1

it was placed in the town @entity157 ( pictured ) ¿ which is now used as a court ¿ and has been hanging in the same spot ever since			0
sir @entity14 was killed after being was shot through the temple by a musket ball at the @entity9 , where , @entity147 folklore contends , he fought in his top hat and tails because his uniform had not arrived at the frontline in time			1
his military reputation was so high after his death that several colonial frontier towns in @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 were named after him and he remains the only @entity11 to be buried in @entity169			2

@entity181 , a spokeswoman for the museum , said that although sir @entity14 was a ' cruel and brutal ' governor of @entity29 , he was a ' a man of his time ' and should not be judged by today ’s standards			1
' i think it would be a shame to move the painting from its original home , ' she said			0
' @entity14 was a very well respected general but on the other hand he was regarded as a rough and tough man and a great disciplinarian			2
' he was a great leader of men and these wars were tough			0
' it was hand to hand fighting and they were not like the battles of today			0
he would have been right in the middle of it			0
' i think we have to accept @entity14 warts and all and not judge him by today 's standards			1
' @entity208 , former mayor of @entity16 , said removing the painting would be churlish			0
he said : ' @entity130 suffered no ill effects from the treatment she received and required no medical attention afterwards			0
' after she was released from custody she walked more than a mile to the store where the crime took place , smoking a cigar			0
' in february 1810 the court ordered @entity14 's recognisance and no further action ever took place			1
he was , and remains to this day , innocent of all the charges			0
