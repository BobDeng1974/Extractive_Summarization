by @entity0 last updated at 3:43 am on 21st december 2011 it was all smiles and festive cheer when @entity4 dropped in on @entity6 troops for a coffee and a chat during a surprise @entity10 trip to @entity12 yesterday			1
but back home , anger was mounting against the government for capping military pay rises at 1 per cent a year from 2013 – a real - terms cut			1
mr @entity4 was forced to admit that the @entity18 had ‘ more to do ’ to uphold the @entity19 as top brass and military charities lined up to blast him over a plan which has hit morale at a time when the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are already facing crippling cuts			1
relaxed : @entity4 having coffee with troops at a base in @entity33 , southern @entity12 @entity4 had been due to go to @entity34 but a sand storm meant he had to land at @entity33 instead the pay squeeze for the military came despite the @entity15 hiking benefits , including unemployment payments and disability living allowance , by a record 5.2 per cent			1
the prime minister said : ‘ there is always more to be done			2
we have gone a long way to get it [ the covenant ] into law , giving it real teeth [ but ] we have got further to go			2
’ the row simmered as the government published a report on how it was strengthening the covenant			2
the 116 - page document highlighted ‘ concerns ’ among the rank - and - file over pay and perks , healthcare and education			2
the @entity61 also flagged up continuing worries about long - term care for wounded servicemen and women , support for reservists and the handling of veterans ’ complaints			2
wearing a fleece , khaki trousers and military - style boots , mr @entity4 had been due to make a morale - boosting trip to @entity34 in @entity77 province , where most @entity6 forces are based			1
but his @entity28 flight was forced to divert because a dust storm caused the @entity34 runway to be shut for the first time this year			1
instead , the @entity83 had to land at @entity33 , where only a small proportion of the 9,500 @entity6 troops deployed in @entity12 are based			1
commenting on the dust storm that prevented his visit to @entity77 , mr @entity4 said : ' it 's slightly changed our plan ' adding ' there 's no point whingeing about it ' at @entity33 , mr @entity4 took the opportunity to meet members of @entity28 12 ( @entity95 ) squadron - from @entity96 in @entity97 - who fly the @entity100 fighter jet on missions all over @entity12			1
in a reference to the weather - the first day of poor visibility after weeks of clear skies - the prime minister joked : ' it ’s slightly changed our plan			2
' wearing a black @entity109 fleece , khaki chinos and boots , mr @entity4 was shown around a @entity100			1
he also met @entity113 general @entity112 , the head of @entity114 , for talks on military progress in @entity12			0
and he had a chat over a mug of tea with soldiers and air personnel in the @entity123 canteen			0
but plans to take a helicopter to @entity126 to meet the governor of @entity77 and visit a frontline base in the province had to be abandoned			0
the prime minister 's visit was meant as a pre-christmas morale booster for troops mr @entity4 was given a tour of the base and shown one of the @entity100 fighters from 12 ( @entity95 ) squadron speaking to journalists on the trip , mr @entity4 admitted it was ' disappointing ' but said @entity6 troops in @entity12 faced the same issues every day			1
' you just have to take it as it comes in this job , ' he said			0
' what we have experienced today is what people working out here experience the whole time			0
' he said there was ' no point whingeing about it ' and he had been able to meet service personnel he would not usually see			0
' you just have to take the rough with the smooth ; i do n’t feel particularly jinxed , ' he added in response to the suggestion that he faced regular difficulties on foreign trips			0
the prime minister was due to go to @entity126 to visit the governor of @entity77 but the trip had to be abandoned the prime minister defended imposing a one per cent pay rise cap for troops from 2013 , insisting the money was better spent on increasing the operational allowance for those on active duty overseas			1
he said : ' i think we are doing the right thing - and remember , we have doubled the operational allowance so that people serving out here in @entity12 get that extra £ 5,000			2
' using the money that way , rather than having a blanket pay increase where a lot of the extra money would go to pay generals and colonels and the rest of it , is i think the right thing to do			1
' the report records improvements to operational allowances , leave arrangements , mental healthcare provision and support for forces children 's education over the past year			0
but shadow health secretary @entity200 said : ' our forces will judge ministers on actions , not warm words			0
' speaking about the dust storm , he said there was ' no point whingeing about it ' and he had been able to meet service personnel he would not usually see among the troops he met general @entity112 , head of @entity114 , for talks on military progress in @entity12 the prime minister indicated that he was planning further withdrawals of troops in 2013 after the 500 due to be pulled out next year			1
he again refused to give an exact timescale for how @entity6 ’s deployment would be withdrawn ahead of his deadline for all combat troops to be out by the end of 2014			0
but he told reporters : ' i do n’t want to see some massive cliff - edge in 2014 - i do n’t think that ’s practical			0
' but i do n’t think we need to make hard and fast decisions at this stage			0
' he said there was ' an ongoing conversation with our allies ' about how and when @entity237 forces would be withdrawn over the next three years			0
' i ’m absolutely clear that the @entity6 public deserve to know there is an endpoint to our involvement in @entity12 and that endpoint is 2014 , ' he said			0
mr @entity4 examines a @entity100 fighter jet from 12 ( @entity95 at the airfield mr @entity4 watches as one of the @entity100 aircraft is refuelled at the @entity33 base			1

' there always more to be done ' to help veterans , admits @entity4 *...* but he insists pay rise of just 1 *%* is ' the right thing '
