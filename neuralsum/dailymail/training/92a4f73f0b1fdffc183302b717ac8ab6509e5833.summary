by @entity0 published : 16:22 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 16:25 est , 28 september 2013 a long - haul truck driver and practicing @entity2 was allegedly called a ' depraved terrorist ' by police and threatened with jail by a judge for wearing a ' rag ' on his head after being pulled over in @entity9			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) has filed two complaints of harassment over the case , in which @entity14 , 49 , was arrested for refusing to turn over his kirpan , a three - inch ceremonial dagger that all @entity2 men are required to carry as part of their faith			1
the blade is typically sewn into the waistband and rarely , if ever , brandished in public			1
truck driver @entity14 , a devotee of the @entity2 faith , was arrested in @entity9 for refusing to surrender his @entity24 ( right ) , which local police claimed was an illegal weapon and allegedly called him a ' terrorist '			1
@entity2 men are expected to carry a kirpan - a small sword usually worn on the waistband - at all times , much as a @entity34 might wear a crucifix as a necklace			1
@entity14 was driving from @entity37 to @entity38 on january 16 to pick up a chicken delivery when he was stopped by two officers from the @entity41 ( @entity42 ) for driving with a flat tyre in @entity44 , @entity9 according to the @entity10 complaint - which is claiming a ' disgraceful ' infringement of religious rights and has been lodged with @entity9 officials - the officers ' laughed ' and ' mocked ' @entity14 when he attempted to explain his kirpan was not illegal and actually a sacred religious article			1
' one officer declared that all @entity2 are depraved and '' terrorists '' , ' the @entity10 said in a letter to the @entity42			1
@entity55 @entity2 devotees gather next to the illuminated @entity57 's holiest shrine , the @entity58 in @entity59 on september 1 , 2013			2
a recent survey found that most @entity61 wrongly believed @entity57 is a sect of @entity63			2
@entity57 is a progressive religion founded in the @entity65 ( eastern @entity66 and northern @entity55 ) over 500 years ago by @entity67			2
there are approximately 30 million followers worldwide			2

the founder @entity67 ( 1469 - 1538 ) was born into a @entity95 family , but said he received a call from @entity73 establishing him as a guru , making the assertion : ' there is no @entity100 , and there is no @entity95			0
' @entity14 was taken into custody for refusing to obey a command and was forced to return to @entity9 on march 26 for a court hearing			0
at the hearing , judge @entity105 of the @entity106 ejected @entity14 from the courtroom because of the turban he was wearing , stating that he would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed " that rag " from his head			1
however @entity14 's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful			0

speaking about the attack , dr @entity14 who was called ' @entity136 ' and ' terrorist ' , said the incident was a reminder of the need for a ' national conversation ' about what it means to be @entity61			0
' ultimately , to simply punish the individuals who 've acted out on hate crimes is insufficient , " he told @entity143			0
' more broadly , we need to have a real national conversation around who looks @entity61 , what does it mean to be @entity61			0
' earlier this month a @entity152 survey found even though almost all turban - wearers in @entity61 are @entity2 , about 70 per cent of @entity61 misidentify them as @entity100 , @entity154 , hindus or members of the @entity158 faith			1
