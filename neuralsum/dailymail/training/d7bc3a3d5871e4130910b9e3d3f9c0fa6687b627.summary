by @entity0 lots of us think we ’re doing well if we make time to exfoliate our faces			1
now hair experts want us to start scrubbing our scalps , too			0
a number of big brands have added exfoliating shampoos and scalp masks to their ranges , while several top treatment centres offer scalp ‘ facials ’			1
but what do they actually do ? scrubbing up well : scalp exfoliators clear away troublesome dandruff and take years off your locks ‘ the scalp is much like the skin , but with more oil glands and hair follicles , ’ says trichologist @entity20			1
‘ this means that sebum and dead skin cells can build up , causing oiliness and flaking , particularly if you ’re prone to dermatitis or psoriasis			1
’ but scalp exfoliators wo n’t just clear away troublesome dandruff — they could take years off your locks , too			1
‘ a build - up of sebum and dead skin cells blocks the pores , and leads to increased shedding , ’ says @entity20			1
‘ in fact , this is one of the key reasons hair thins as we age			0
cell turnover slows with age so dead cells need help to be scrubbed away			1
exfoliating the scalp once a week will clear away this build - up			1
’ it also means your usual products will be more effective , as they ’ll be better able to penetrate the follicles			1
just do n’t over do it			0
‘ if you ’ve got a sensitive scalp it ’s best to avoid coarse exfoliants , which can be abrasive and irritate the skin , ’ says @entity20			1
‘ look for products that contain salicylic acid or fruit enzymes , as these gently soften dead skin so it can be rinsed rather than scrubbed away			1
’ as someone with a dry , flaky but super-sensitive scalp , i ’m a little apprehensive about putting any of these products near my hair , but the promise of glossy , younger - looking locks is enough to make me reconsider			1
so , which are worth trying ? @entity70 , £ 20 for 200ml , lookfantastic.com ingredients : salicylic acid is said to reduce the build - up of dead cells , and turmeric and ginseng are there to speed up cell turnover			1
this botanical shampoo promises stronger , thicker - looking hair			1
how to use it : like a normal shampoo , and then condition and style as usual			0
verdict : the shampoo is an unappealing brown colour and smells slightly medicated			0
it did n’t create much foam , even from a good palm - sized amount			2
my scalp was wonderfully clean , although my hair , which is curly , felt a little too dry for my liking			2
still , there was no flakiness			0
@entity97 : 7/10 @entity98 , £ 32 for 85ml , @entity99 ingredients : contains a concentrated dose of active fruit enzymes to break down cells , and exfoliating micro-beads for the scrub			2
it also contains caviar extract , which is said to be nourishing			0
how to use it : once a week , apply it before your shampoo , then condition and style as normal			0
verdict : the granular gel is a cinch to apply thanks to the bristle head of the brush applicator , which gives a heavenly head massage			0
and best of all , my locks did n’t feel at all dry afterwards			2
a clear scalp — and , for me , a clear winner			1
not even a tiny bit of flakiness			0
@entity97 : 10/10 @entity126 , £ 6 for 20ml , @entity127 ingredients : containing salicylic and moisturising plant oils to moisturise , this gentle mask is designed to also soothe the scalp			2
how to use it : once a week before shampooing			0
verdict : completely smooth and odourless , it does n’t feel as abrasive as other products containing salicylic acid			2
the instructions recommend conditioning your hair at the same time , so i apply the exfoliator to my roots and my favourite hair mask through the ends and sit it out for 20 minutes			0
afterwards , my scalp feels like it can breathe in the same way that your face glows after exfoliation			2
my hair seems lighter somehow			0
there is no trace of my usual flakiness and my scalp is completely itch - free			1
@entity97 : 8/10 @entity155 , £ 28.25 for 178ml , beautybay.co.uk ingredients : the cream is infused with natural fruit enzymes to soften skin cells , as well as a gentle bamboo scrub			1
how to use it : the directions advise massaging into the scalp , two to three times a week , but it did leave my hair a bit dry , so i would advise using an extra dollop of conditioner afterwards			2
verdict : the @entity155 range is designed especially for wavy , curly hair			0
the herbal - scented lotion was grainy but not quite as gritty as the others , so did n’t feel quite as exfoliating , although i enjoyed the three - minute massage			2
my scalp was thoroughly cleansed , but my hair felt a little dry			2
@entity97 : @entity179 @entity180 , £ 20 for 100ml , kiehls.co.uk ingredients : contains finely - ground apricot seed and argan shell for the scrub , and menthol to increase blood flow to the scalp			1
how to use it : apply once a week after shampooing			0
verdict : i loved the scrubbing sensation , not to mention the cooling zing of mint			0
my scalp was left with a lovely tingling feeling afterwards and it did n’t dry my hair out either			0
this seemed to soothe rather than irritate my sensitive scalp , earning it a place in my bathroom cabinet			0

like your skin , the scalp builds up dead cells , causing oiliness and flaking
