a few words have been exchanged and it ’s just @entity16 , friday night			2
' mr @entity61 said : ' it is the prosecution ’s case that mr @entity8 did not do anything that could have provoked the assault upon him			0
' it is appalling this incident should have happened over whether cheese had been melted on the defendant ’s chips			1

a tragedy to a much lesser degree for the defendant and his family			0
' he was a quiet , law - abiding young man , no doubt with hopes and dreams for the future			0
' the most difficult thing is that this defendant fears for his future and that he has one and mr @entity8 does not because of his actions			0
he is a young man wracked with guilt			0
he plays over the early hours of may 5 over and over again and wishes he could turn back time			0
' passing sentence , judge @entity161 said : ' i want to stress that no sentence can properly reflect the loss of life			0
' following sentencing , detective chief inspector @entity167 said : ' this was such a tragic and unnecessary loss of life which goes to highlight the potential dangers of drinking far too much alcohol and being oblivious to the consequences of your actions			0
