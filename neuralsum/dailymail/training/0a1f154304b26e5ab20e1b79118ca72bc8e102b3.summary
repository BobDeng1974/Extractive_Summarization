by @entity0 and @entity1 attack : the @entity4 advert targeting @entity5			1
she hit back at the ' baseless ' campaign actresses @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are being targeted in a new ‘ crummy mummy ’ campaign by @entity4 , which accuses them of denying their children access to their fathers			1
the pressure group is using the @entity18 stars in a series of adverts criticising their childcare arrangements			1
the new controversy comes after actress @entity23 , who has three children by three fathers , last week threatened to sue for being singled out in a @entity27 advert by @entity4			1
undeterred , the group says it will continue to highlight high - profile mothers who , they say , deny their children access to their fathers for no good reason			2
the @entity8 poster features a large picture of the star and the headline : ‘ @entity8 , do you believe in equal parents , equal love ? ’ text on the advert reads : ‘ @entity8 demanded sole custody of her daughter @entity41 in her divorce from @entity43 , limiting the time the actor spends with her			2
’ last night ms @entity5 ’s lawyer @entity45 criticised @entity46 , saying : ‘ the campaign is baseless and offensive			1
@entity8 will continue to have no comment on personal and private matters that affect her family			2
’ the 38 - year - old actress is believed to have divorced @entity43 last year because of her long - held concerns over @entity43 ’s status as one of the leading figures in the @entity56			0
she was said to be determined to shield her daughter from it			0
another poster features a picture of @entity61 - winning star @entity9 with the headline : ‘ @entity64 , a father is for life , not just conception			2
’ it reads : ‘ actress @entity9 tried to take her daughter @entity68 to live in @entity69 against her husband ’s wishes			2
’ in fact , a judge in @entity73 refused her application to move to @entity69 after hearing objections from @entity68 ’s father , @entity69 - @entity79 model @entity77			0
@entity80 and @entity77 then announced an amicable joint custody arrangement			0
provocative : @entity4 has attacked @entity10 , left , and @entity9 , right , with slogans like ' a father is for life not just conception '			1
the group claims the celebrities have denied their exes access to their children protest : a @entity4 member dressed as @entity91			1
the group regularly goes for high - profile stunts the poster targeting @entity10 , who has daughter called @entity96 with @entity18 actor @entity97 , is headlined : ‘ @entity10 , never hate your ex more than you love your child			2
’ the advert claims that ms @entity10 ‘ fought ’ with mr @entity97 over his access rights to their daughter			1
@entity97 blamed the stress of a seven - year custody battle on his decision to leave an angry voicemail message in which he called his daughter , then aged 11 , a ‘ rude , thoughtless , little pig ’			0
last night a spokesman for @entity4 said the crummy mummy adverts were part of its ongoing campaign against the ‘ fatherless society ’			0
he added : ‘ as an organisation we strongly believe in 50/50 shared parenting and are concerned that contact denial – where one parent denies a child access to the other parent , normally the father – is not only increasing , but is a serious human rights violation and an abuse of a child ’s right to their father			0
‘ the behaviour of female role models shapes public thinking and we will promote those celebrity mothers who support shared parenting while naming those who fail to support it			0
’ fury : @entity23 threatened to sue @entity4 over an advert , left , which she said misquoted her			1
right , @entity8 with her and @entity43 's daughter @entity41 , who she reportedly wanted to shield from @entity139 the group claims that 200 children lose contact with their fathers every day in secret family courts , that half of court orders are broken and not enforced , and that there are 3.8 million fatherless children in @entity149			1
the first advert appeared after @entity23 said in an interview : ‘ my kids do n’t go back and forth			0
none of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me ; that is it			0
’ @entity4 then produced a poster that said : ‘ @entity5 , every child deserves a father for @entity27			0
’ her lawyers said it was ‘ misleading and defamatory ’			0
ms @entity23 ’s ex-husband , director @entity163 , father of her son @entity164 , also expressed his disapproval of the campaign , saying : ‘ it is inappropriate for this organisation to involve my family and me when they know nothing of our personal circumstances			1
while i fully support fathers ’ rights , i can state this has never been a concern for me or my son			0
’ @entity10 and @entity9 declined to comment .			1
