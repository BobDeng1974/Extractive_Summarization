@entity0 was definitely not the word when it came to this new arrival			0
new father @entity4 live tweeted the birth of his son @entity6 all over the internet , while clutching wife @entity9 's hand in one hand and his @entity11 in the other			1
the project manager documented before , during and after the caesarian delivery , posting @entity16 photos to his @entity18 account as it happened			1
@entity4 posted the progress throughout birth of baby son on @entity16 and @entity18 mr @entity4 first started taking @entity11 snaps while he and his wife were waiting to go to the delivery suite ' from taking each photo , applying a filter , writing the caption and tweeting it probably took about 20 seconds so i was able to get them straight out there for people to see , ' explains mr @entity4			1
the couple , who live in @entity35 , @entity36 , had baby @entity6 at @entity37			2
they already have a four - year - old daughter @entity39 and it was her birth , says 32 - year - old mr @entity4 , which first prompted his photography hobby			1
' i realised there was n't a lot of decent quality photos of the big occasion then , so this time round i did see it as part of my role to capture the event			0
' we did n't really discuss it beforehand , but i am a huge @entity18 user and i got the idea because i know a couple of people who have tweeted their weddings ; the groom has been standing at the altar tweeting away discreetly , although i do n't know anyone who 's done it for a birth before			0
' booked in for an elective @entity62 , mr @entity4 first started taking @entity11 snaps while he and his wife were waiting to go to the delivery suite			1
' because we were a non-emergency procedure , there was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up , ' he smiles			0
the project manager documented before , during and after the @entity62 delivery of his son @entity6 mr @entity4 posted eight photos from when they arrived until they left with @entity6 all tucked up in his little hat and gloves now the family and their friends will always have the unique montage to look back on and remember			1
pictured here with the baby is the couple 's daughter @entity39 ' i had my phone with me and also my proper camera so i was taking better quality photos with that , but i did n't have the ability to share those instantly			0
they went onto a memory card to be uploaded when we got home			0
' but the beauty of @entity16 , which is a photo sharing site , is you have a @entity18 option built in so it was easy to just snap away and then tweet the links			2
' given that she was busy with the job of giving birth , mr @entity4 says his wife left it to his discretion about what images were taken and what were shared with his hundreds of followers			1
mr @entity4 said : ' there was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up ' mr @entity4 started tweeting at 9am and carried on until 11.30am , after the baby was born ' she did n't give me any rules or dos and don'ts , but in the end there were a lot more graphic photos i was n't willing share , ' he laughs			2
mr @entity4 says he was careful to ensure that the actual arrival , and most importantly the mother - to - be , were n't forgotten in his eagerness to capture the event			2
' i made sure @entity9 never felt neglected , of course , ' he adds , ' although since i 've become a keen amateur photographer she 's quite used to having a camera pointed at her now			0
' over the 30 hours the couple and @entity133 were in hospital , mr @entity4 posted eight photos from when they arrived until they left with @entity6 all tucked up in his little hat and gloves			1
now the family and their friends will always have the unique montage to look back on and remember			0
so , does mr @entity4 intend to whip out his iphone for another special occasion ? ' we 're not planning any more children but i 'd definitely do it again , ' he laughs			2
' maybe for the christening ... '			0
