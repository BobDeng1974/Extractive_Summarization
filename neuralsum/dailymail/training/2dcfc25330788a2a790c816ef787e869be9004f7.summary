drivers face having their cars fitted with devices that slam on the brakes if they go over the speed limit , under draconian new road safety measures being drawn up by officials in @entity8			1
all new cars would have to include camera systems that ‘ read ’ the limits displayed on road signs and automatically apply the brakes			1
and vehicles already on the road could even be sent back to garages to be fitted with the ‘ @entity17 ’ technology , meaning that no car in the @entity19 would be allowed to travel faster than 70mph – the speed limit on motorways			1
all new cars would have to include camera systems that ' read ' the limits displayed on road signs and automatically apply the brakes transport secretary @entity24 is said to have ‘ erupted ’ when the proposals landed on his desk and has told his officials to block the moves			1
he has been asked by the @entity29 for his views ahead of the publication of formal proposals this autumn			2
the @entity29 ’s @entity33 hopes to roll out the ‘ @entity35 ’ technology ( @entity35 ) as part of a new road safety programme , which aims to slash the death toll from traffic accidents by a third by 2020			1
every year , more than 30,000 people die on the roads in @entity43 countries and a shocking 1.5 million are injured , of whom 120,000 are left permanently disabled			0
mr @entity24 has stressed to officials that the @entity19 already has one of the best road safety records in @entity47 experts estimate that 6,000 of those deaths could be prevented if drivers obeyed speed limits			1
but mr @entity24 has stressed to officials that the @entity19 already has one of the best road safety records in @entity47			2
the number of people killed on our roads fell last year from 1,901 to 1,754 – the lowest figure since records began in 1926			0
by comparison , 3,645 people died in @entity60 and 3,657 in @entity61			0
the @entity35 technology works in one of two ways – either through satellites , which communicate limits automatically to cars from databases , or by using cameras to read road signs			1
it then deploys one of three controls to slow drivers : ‘ advice ’ , in which the motorist is simply notified of the speed limit by an alarm , giving them the opportunity to slow down ; ‘ driver select ’ , which arrests the car ’s speed but gives the driver the option of disabling the device ; or ‘ mandatory ’ , which would not let a driver breach the speed limit under any circumstances			2
mr @entity24 was told by his officials that new vehicles will soon be designed with camera and satellite technology automatically incorporated , making it ‘ cheap and easy ’ to add speed - control systems			1
last night , a @entity99 source said mr @entity100 had instructed officials to block the moves because they were a ‘ violation ’ of @entity19 motorists ’ freedom			1
the source said : ‘ this has @entity17 written all over it and is exactly the sort of thing that gets people ’s backs up about @entity8			0
we are about getting a better deal for @entity19 , not letting @entity43 bureaucrats encroach further into people ’s lives			0
‘ @entity29 wanted his views ahead of plans to publish the proposals this autumn			2
he made it very clear what those views were			0
’ no car in the @entity19 would be allowed to travel faster than 70mph - the speed limit on motorways a spokesman for the @entity127 said at lower speeds the new technology could actually create dangers			2
he said : ‘ if you were overtaking a tractor and suddenly needed to accelerate to avoid a head - on collision , you would not be able to			0
’ but he said he would support a system of audible speed alerts			0
a spokesman for the @entity29 said : ‘ it is part of the @entity29 ’s job – because it has been mandated to do so by member states , including the @entity19 – to look at , promote research into and consult stakeholders about new road - safety technology which might ultimately save lives			1
this is done in close co-operation with member states and the @entity19 has generally supported such efforts			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ there is a currently consultation focusing on speed - limiting technology already fitted to hgvs and buses			0
‘ taking account of the results , the @entity29 will publish in the autumn a document by its technical experts which will no doubt refer to @entity35 among many other things			0

cars would include cameras that ‘ read ’ the limits displayed on road signs
the technology would then automatically apply the car *'s* brakes

has been asked by the @entity29 for his views , but he has told his officials to block the moves
