by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 13 september 2013 the number of @entity2 struggling to buy food is on the rise , and the ranks of the starving may get considerably worse			1
five years after the start of the @entity8 , one in five @entity2 struggle to afford food , according to a new @entity10 poll			0
the 20 per cent who struggled to buy food in august come close to numbers seen during the darkest days of the economic downturn			2
with funding set to be cut from the food stamp program in november , more people may be unable to buy food			1
the recession peak of 20.4 per cent was recorded by @entity10 in november 2008 , the firm said.the staggering number of @entity2 unable to buy food is on the rise despite bold proclamations the recession is over amid improving unemployment numbers now below eight percent			1
they ca n't afford food : many @entity2 are lining up at food banks and relying on food stamps to feed themselves ‘ these findings suggest that the economic recovery may be disproportionately benefitting upper - income @entity2 rather than those who are struggling to fulfill their basic needs , ’ said @entity10			1
the unemployment rate , now at 7.3 per cent , has widely been criticized as an inaccurate picture of the current jobs crisis since it does not count people who have given up trying to find jobs			0
a more accurate number , many would argue , is the @entity38 , which is at a shockingly low 63.2 per cent , according to the @entity39 , the lowest number recorded in the past decade			0
the @entity38 is a measure of all people ready , willing and able to work – the unemployment rate is simply a measure of people collecting unemployment benefits , which have long - since expired for millions of @entity2 out of work			2
starving : the percentage of @entity2 who ca n't afford food jumped alarmingly last month dropping , that 's good right ? : the unemployment rate is now down to 7.3 per cent , and is on a downward trend , but that does n't tell the whole story where the problem lies : the labor force participation rate , a measure of all people ready , willing and able to work , is at an all - time low 63.2 per cent stagnant , and in some cases falling , wages are also contributing to this perfect storm of @entity61 many @entity2 not seeing raises in a difficult economic climate , the average hourly pay for non-governmental , non-supervisory workers has dropped from $ 8.85 in june 2009 to only $ 8.77 in july 2013 , according to a @entity67 report quoted by @entity10			1
‘ depressed wages are likely negatively affecting the economic recovery by reducing consumer spending , but another serious and costly implication may be that fewer @entity2 are able to consistently afford food , ’ @entity10 said			0
this latest poll comes just over a month after an @entity75 poll showed that four in five @entity2 experience poverty at some point during their lifetime , with some rural area experiencing almost 99 per cent poverty			0
staggering : one in five @entity2 ca n't afford food now , but that number may rise as expanded food stamp benefits will likely expire in november no jobs , or poor wages : job fairs all over the country are jammed with people looking for work despite the false optimism provided by a lowering unemployment rate that 80 per cent of @entity2 need government assistance at some point in their lives , and a near - record high 20 per cent could n’t buy enough food last month is alarming			1
the number of @entity2 unable to nourish themselves may rise further , as recent reports suggest the federal government is set to slash funding to the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) aimed at helping poverty - stricken families put food on the table - this despite rising numbers of families joining each month , according to the @entity106			1
‘ republicans in @entity108 are proposing substantial cuts and reforms to the program … food stamp benefits are set to be reduced in november after a provision of the 2009 fiscal stimulus program expires , ’ @entity10 said			2
@entity115 @entity107 are standing firm on a proposed $ 40billion in cuts to the @entity100 food stamp program , according to @entity119 , a move opposed by @entity121			0
almost 48million @entity2 rely on @entity100 to put food on their table			0
messages left for further comment with both @entity10 and the @entity106 were not immediately returned .			0

the number of @entity2 unable to buy food is approaching recession highs seen in 2008
the unemployment rate is dropping , but wages are not rising
record numbers of families are on food stamps
with food stamp funding set to be cut in november , even more families may soon starve
