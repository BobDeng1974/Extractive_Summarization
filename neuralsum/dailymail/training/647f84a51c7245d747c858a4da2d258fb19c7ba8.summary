the @entity1 ’s highly secret unmanned space plane will land in june - ending a year - long mission in orbit			1
the experimental @entity4 has been circling @entity5 at 17,000 miles per hour and was due to land in @entity7 in december			1
it is now expected to land in mid to late june			1
at launch , the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits , leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board			0
mystery tour : the mission of the @entity20 space plane was extended after it spent nine months orbiting the @entity5 the men and women of @entity23 are ready to execute safe landing operations anytime and at a moment 's notice , ' said colonel @entity27 of the @entity1 's @entity28			1
the plane resembles a mini space shuttle and is the second to fly in space			0
it was meant to land in march , but the mission of the @entity20 orbital test vehicle was extended – for unknown reasons			1
the first one landed last december at @entity38 in @entity7 after more than seven months in orbit			1
the 29 - foot , solar - powered craft had an original mission of 270 days			2
the @entity1 said the second mission was to further test the technology but the ultimate purpose has largely remained a mystery			0
the vehicle 's systems program director , lieutenant - colonel @entity46 , told the @entity48 in december : ' we initially planned for a nine - month mission			1
keeping the @entity20 in orbit will provide us with additional experimentation opportunities and allow us to extract the maximum value out of the mission			1
' questions : the unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the @entity1 - but its purpose has never fully been explained finishing touches : scientists in protective suits inspect the solar - powered craft prior to its mission however , many sceptics think that the vehicle 's mission is defence or spy - related			2
there are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new @entity75 space station , @entity76			0
however , analysts have pointed out that surveillance would be tricky , since the spacecraft would rush past each other at thousands of metres per second			0
the top - secret robot plane is now expected to land in mid- to late - june keeping watch : an artist 's rendition of the @entity20 shuttle orbiting the @entity5 and @entity87 , from the @entity88 , pointed out to the @entity89 : ‘ if the @entity90 really wanted to observe @entity76 , it has enough assets to do that without using @entity20			1
’ last may , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first @entity20 which included flyovers of @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance			2
other industry analysts have speculated that the @entity1 is just making use of the @entity20 ’s amazing fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts			2
@entity111 this undated image released by the @entity1 shows the @entity20 spacecraft			0
its mission and cost are shrouded in secrecy lift off : the @entity20 sits on top of an @entity120 rocket as it 's launched at @entity121 in @entity122 in 2010 ready for launch : the @entity20 rocket in @entity122 before it blasted off into space mystery : scientists work on a prototype for the rocket prior to its launch after all , under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the @entity135 administration , the office that developed the @entity20 will be shut down			2
according to @entity20 manufacturer @entity4 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			1
by comparison , the @entity139 orbits at about 220 miles			0
the current flight launched from @entity121 , @entity122 , in march			0
@entity111 this computer image shows the space plane re-entering @entity5			2
although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans			0
it 's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m			0
it is powered by batteries and solar cells			0

the @entity20 has been circling the @entity5 at 17,000mph and was due to land in @entity7 in december
mission of highly *classified* robotic plane extended for unknown reasons
will now land in mid- to late - june
