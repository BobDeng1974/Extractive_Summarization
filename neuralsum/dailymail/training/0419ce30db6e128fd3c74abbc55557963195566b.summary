there is little to differentiate the two orange - suited men kneeling alongside each other in @entity4 's latest hostage video			1
but a closer look at the @entity7 nationals reveals one thought he was the reincarnation of a cross-dressing @entity7 princess - while the other is a @entity11 convert who some fear felt he needed to save him			1
journalist @entity15 and @entity16 both appeared in the latest @entity4 video , in which the terror group warns they will be beheaded unless their government pays a $ 200million ransom by friday			1
but as the men wait to hear their fate , a picture of two very different people thrown together in war - torn @entity25 by chance a little less than a year ago has started to emerge			1
@entity15 and @entity16 both appeared in the latest @entity4 video , where a man - believed to be @entity29 - threatened to behead them if @entity7 did not pay a $ 200million ransom for their safe release @entity16 , 42 , was the first to be captured sometime after july 21 , the date of his last blog post , having arrived in @entity25 earlier in the year			1
his arrival in the @entity37 followed a number of difficult years , which appeared to begin in 2005 , when his business failed , leaving him in debt and , at one point , reportedly homeless			0
by his own account , he had changed his name to the feminine - sounding @entity46 , and attempted to kill himself by cutting off his genitals in 2008 , likening the act to the ritual suicide of a samurai			2
' i thought if i failed i would live as a woman and leave the rest to destiny , ' he wrote later			0
he was saved by his wife , who died of cancer two years later			0
@entity16 would also come to believe his was the reincarnation of a cross-dressing @entity59 princess , who had spied for @entity7 in @entity60			1
by late 2013 , @entity16 had begun a flirtation with @entity7 's extreme right - wing politics and cultivated a new persona as a self - styled security consultant , according to his @entity66 page and blog posts , though he never did any work as a consultant			2
@entity16 , pictured here preparing to fire an @entity70 , has previously claimed to be the reincarnation of a cross-dressing princess , who spied for @entity7 during the @entity60 @entity16 - who tried to commit suicide by cutting off his genitals in about 2008 - traveled to @entity25 after ' his life reached its limit ' , according to his father he borrowed money to travel to @entity25 and dreamed of providing security to big @entity7 companies in conflict areas like the coast of @entity83			1
the @entity25 civil war was a new start â€“ and his last chance to make a success in life , he told friends and family			2
later this year , he planned to head to @entity83 ' where the danger factor will be amped up '			0
' he felt his life had reached its limit , ' said @entity16 's father , @entity92 , 74			2
@entity16 had hoped @entity93 would be a success , but @entity94 , a retired former local assembly who also served as an adviser to @entity99 's business , had reservations			2
' his idea sounded interesting at the beginning , but he had no money or experience , ' said @entity94 , who described @entity16 as a ' gentle , likable person '			0
it seems @entity15 also picked up on his lack of experience when the pair met last april , after @entity16 had been caught and detained by an anti-government militant group @entity110 , or @entity110			1
after that first meeting , @entity112 - an experienced reporter who have covered many war zones - described @entity16 as ' hapless '			1
he had set up a company , but those who met him - including @entity15 - felt he lacked experience ' he needed someone with experience to help him , ' @entity15 told @entity120 in august			2
it is said his subsequent abduction haunted @entity15			0
" i need to go there at least once and see my fixers and ask them what the current situation is			0
i need to talk to them face to face			0
i think that 's necessary , " @entity15 said , referring to locals who work freelance for foreign correspondents , setting up meetings and helping with the language			0
@entity15 , 47 , was in @entity25 with his video news company @entity137 , which mainly covered conflicts , poverty , refugees and children in war zones			1
he also worked with @entity144 organizations including @entity145 and the @entity144 refugee agency			0
but unlike @entity16 , it was not the glamour of war which attracted him to @entity25			2
friend @entity150 , also a freelance journalist , said : ' children , the poor and the needy , those are where he is coming from			0
' he just wants to meet children in conflicted areas and tell the rest of the world their suffering			0
@entity15 is a devout @entity11 who worried about @entity99 after meeting him in @entity25 in april ' as he follows their stories , he ends up in war zones			1
' his former pastor @entity165 said the fatherof - two is motivated in his work by his @entity11 faith , describing @entity15 as a journalist who always stood on the side of little people in dangerous areas			1
friends now fear @entity15 may have gone looking for @entity16 during a trip to @entity25 in late october - the trip he never returned from			1
@entity150 revealed he said nothing about looking for the captured @entity16 , but he now wonders if his friend did try to find @entity16 while he was in the area as reported by some @entity7 media - and was captured in the process			1
however , what does seem likely is that @entity112 will be turning to his faith in captivity			0
the devout @entity184 , who converted in 1997 , has previously spoken openly about his religion			0
' i have seen horrible places and have risked my life , but i know that somehow @entity190 will always save me , ' the father - of - two said in a may article for the @entity7 publication @entity193			2
he told the same publication he never risked anything dangerous , citing a passage in the @entity197 , ' do not put the lord your @entity190 to the test ' .			0
