imagine if all the secessionist movements in the history of the @entity2 were successful			1
imagine if all the proposals put forward for states to withdraw from the union of the @entity2 actually went ahead , how would @entity2 look today ? those questions have been answered by a map that predicts the alternate universe of the @entity2 based on all the threats or aspirations to secede from the @entity2			1
the map , created by @entity12 geogapher professor @entity13 , breaks the country up into 124 states			1
the west and middle america : take a look at some of the proposals for new states that have popped up over the years			2
@entity22 would be split into five states			2
@entity24 would become five , as well the west and middle america : take a look at some of the proposals for new states that have popped up over the years			2
@entity22 would be split into five states			2
@entity24 would become five , as well the @entity27 : @entity28 and @entity29 would be their own states , separate from @entity32 , which would be called ' @entity33			0
' @entity34 is split into three states and the @entity36 and @entity38 @entity37 becomes ' west @entity34 ' while some are almost laughable - such as @entity40 and @entity41 , and @entity43 - others make perfect sense , such as splitting @entity34 into north and south to protect @entity46 from the rest of the state			1
currently there 's an attempt to create the @entity51 in north @entity22 and south @entity52			0
a ballot initiative will decide whether it goes ahead in 2014			0
earlier this year , a handful of counties in @entity56 tried to secede from the rest of the state			0
professor @entity13 said he came with the idea came from the serious possibilities at how different @entity2 could look and be today			1
now that 's more like it : the 50 united states of @entity2 look simple compared to @entity13 ' map ' most of my life , i 've daydreamed about history â€” not so much the incredible depth of historical events that have already occurred , good thinking as that might be , ' he told the @entity72			1
' no , i 've constantly fictionalized history by changing the outcome of one event here and there and exploring the possibilities of what would have come next			0
' sometimes i come up with some utterly ridiculous progressions on these alternate timelines of whole new worlds based on relatively minor changes			0
' perhaps the most well - known secessionist movement was the @entity84 , which existed for four and a half years before collapsing in 1789 and being re-admitted to @entity85 after it failed to support itself economically .			0

@entity12 professor @entity13 has developed a map showing how the @entity2 would look if the secessionist movements throughout history would have been successful
secession is when a state tried to withdraw from the @entity2 union and form its own *political* entity
the map shows @entity2 as having 124 states
secession attempts still occur today
