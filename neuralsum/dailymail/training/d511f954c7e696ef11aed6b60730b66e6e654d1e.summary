but according to one , the @entity13 approach to life can be learned – just as long as you ’re not too bothered about being punctual			0
@entity2 is determined to dispel the myth that @entity6 are perfect and to teach @entity4 expatriates how to avoid embarrassment in social situations across the @entity20			1
she has written a book called @entity23 une française – like a @entity6 – which was inspired by her own experiences of struggling to fit in during two years living and working in @entity26			1
miss @entity2 realised that many brits are daunted by the formidable reputation of the @entity6 , especially after a torrent of publications – with titles such as @entity6 women do n’t get fat and @entity6 children do n’t @entity32 – telling them how their continental counterparts do things better			1
but miss @entity2 , 27 , from @entity36 , said : ‘ our reputation is such that [ @entity4 women ] get the impression they ’re doing it all wrong			0
‘ we daunt them , so i break down the clichés and explain without taboos our codes – ones we do n’t even know we have			2
’ arriving on time for dinner in @entity6 , for example , is a cardinal sin			2
‘ you @entity4 are so punctual , but in @entity6 if you arrive bang on time you are likely to be met by someone without make - up and an uncooked dinner , ’ miss @entity2 warned			1
she said she always tells her foreign friends to be 15 to 20 minutes late , but no more as this would be ‘ impolite ’			0
the non-initiated should also brush up on current affairs as the @entity6 love to debate , she added			2
@entity4 women – and those from @entity60 – are also advised to learn to take compliments in their stride , and make sure they do not interpret them as a come - on or even as sexual harassment			2
secret goose lover : it is fine to say ' no thanks ' to foie gras , just make sure you keep schtum about your reasons why - it is considered very rude to do so as a protest against the treatment of the geese ‘ how many foreign married women are thunderstruck to hear their @entity6 friend ’s husband tell them “ you look ravishing this evening ” ? ’ she asked			1
‘ we ﬂirt all the time			0
‘ if a man in the street tells you “ you are very pretty mademoiselle ” , this does n’t mean he wants to sleep with you , it just means he thinks you are attractive so he tells you			0
‘ my advice is say “ thank you ” , take it as a free pick - me - up , like a sunny day			0
’ miss @entity2 found said she found people to be very ‘ warm and open ’ during her time in @entity4 – but admitted she was perplexed by conversations that revolved around tv and popular culture , and shocked to see colleagues go out wearing miniskirts in subzero temperatures and drink her under the table			0
she found she only began to understand @entity4 culture when she began to join her colleagues on their friday lunchtime pub outings			0
realising many of the women among the 150,000 @entity4 expatriates in @entity6 must be going through similar issues , she decided to write her book and launch an online course			1
she admitted @entity6 women do have high standards , but added : ‘ if you start going toward them , you ’ll find they love foreign culture and the @entity4 have a very good reputation in @entity6			0
’ @entity115 non : in @entity6 , wine always accompanies a meal , so do not serve wine otherwise - and avoid the cardinal sin of bringing bad wine to a party			1
