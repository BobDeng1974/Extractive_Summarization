@entity2 beads found in @entity3 match the blue glass inlays found in @entity6 's gold death mask , scientists claim			1
the discovery hints at some of the trade routes between @entity3 and the ancient civilisations in @entity11 and @entity12 3,400 years ago			1
it also provides new details that could link the @entity11 cult of worshiping the sun with a similar sun cult that developed at the same time in @entity3			1
the women from the @entity20 site is pictured on the right			0
next to the woman 's left arm was a blue glass bead from @entity11 , two amber beads , and two small bronze spirals			1
similar blue beads have been found in the past but never linked to @entity11			2
on the left is hesselagergård - pit excavated 1878 - 81 twenty - three blue beads unearthed in an @entity32 grave , south of @entity33 , were analysed using a technique known as plasma - spectrometry , according to a report in @entity37			1
the method allowed researchers to analyse the fragile bead and compare the chemical composition of trace elements with material from @entity44 in @entity11 and @entity45 in @entity12			1
the comparison showed that the chemicals matched exactly , marking the first time that @entity50 and @entity51 cobalt glass has been found outside the @entity53 area			0
the blue beads were found in the grave of what is thought to have been a wealthy lady who lay in a hollowed - out oak trunk , wearing an overarm bracelet made of amber beads and other jewellery			2
researchers analysed the fragile bead in the @entity20 grave , south of @entity33 , and compare the chemical composition of elements with material from @entity44 in @entity11 and @entity45 in @entity12 @entity2 beads ( pictured ) found in @entity3 match the blue glass inlays found in @entity6 's gold death mask , scientists claim			1
the discovery hints at some of the trade routes between @entity3 and the ancient civilisations in @entity11 and @entity12 in the @entity2 3,400 years ago the beads had exactly the same chemical composition as ancient @entity11 cobalt glass found in @entity44 the same material was found in @entity6 's death mask ( pictured ) , and a number of other burial sites these 4,000 - year - old @entity2 beads , and worth their weight in gold if you dug these up in your garden , you probably would n’t think twice about throwing them away			1
but the unassuming objects are 4,000 - year - old @entity2 beads , and worth their weight in gold			2
unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on @entity93 last year , they were heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century			0
@entity96 , senior archaeologist from @entity93 , described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century			0
she said : ‘ the amber beads probably came from the @entity101 – and meant they were long - distance trading 4,000 years ago			2
‘ these artefacts show @entity93 was n’t the isolated , hard - to - reach place we thought it was			0
' this has been fascinating to work on , but it ’s just one piece in a puzzle			0
the story is only part - told			0
' scientists believe most of the beads were @entity12 and made from melted quartz sand and ash from @entity116 grass			0
two of them came from @entity11			0
previous studies had already shown that @entity2 amber was exported from @entity122 areas to @entity11 , with @entity6 and other pharaohs burial chambers containing the material			2
researchers from the @entity126 in @entity3 and the @entity127 in @entity128 say the latest study shows that as well as amber , @entity3 and @entity11 traded glass 3,400 years ago they also believe it links two ancient sun cults , based on the fact that sunlight is able to penetrate the surface of both amber and glass			1
the study claims that burying amber and glass may have constituted as a prayer to the sun , to ensure that the dead body would share its fate with the sun on an eternal journey .			0

blue beads unearthed in an ancient @entity20 grave , south of @entity33
they match material from @entity44 in @entity11 and @entity45 in @entity12
this suggests @entity11 glass was traded with amber 3,400 years ago
it also links the @entity11 sun cult with a @entity2 @entity3 sun cult
both civilisations valued material as the sun could penetrate its surface
