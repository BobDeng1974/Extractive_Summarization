by @entity0 the strike on @entity2 today came after @entity4 forces spent the last two months moving ships , jets and troops within striking distance			1
after president @entity11 gave the go ahead last night , two @entity10 fighters flew off from an @entity4 ' supercarrier ' in the @entity13 to fire 500lb laser - guided bombs on a group of @entity17 militants outside @entity19 capital @entity18			1
the jets were on the @entity20 , which was ordered to travel 1,000 miles from the @entity22 to the @entity13 seven weeks ago			1
surrounded : the @entity4 has spent recent months moving its ships , jets and troops within striking distance with today 's attack on @entity2 coming from the @entity13 it begins : one of the two @entity30 fighter jets that bombed the @entity2 artillery position prepares for takeoff from the @entity20 in the @entity13 before the dawn mission this morning ready for action : and as soon as the first two jets returned from their successful bombing run on @entity2 fighters marching on @entity18 this morning , the flight deck of the @entity20 aircraft carrier came alive as more warplanes readied for action it joined the @entity45 's @entity44 - two aircraft carriers - the @entity46 and @entity47 - and several nuclear submarines armed with @entity50 missiles			1
each carrier typically carries 64 aircraft , including the @entity54 fighter jets , @entity56 electronic warfare aircraft , @entity58 surveillance planes and @entity60 - 60 seahawk helicopters			2
there are also five other @entity4 ships believed to be in the @entity22 of needed			1
@entity11 's operational choices are limited to launches from bases outside @entity67 's borders			0
among them are @entity69 in @entity70 , which already houses command and logistics hubs for @entity73 and was ground zero for air sorties over @entity76 and @entity67 since the early days of the @entity78 administration			0
@entity69 is still used for some air missions over @entity76 and houses long - range b1 - bombers			0
closer to @entity67 's northern provinces is an @entity4 air base in @entity85 , @entity86			2
after 2011 , that facility inherited much of the airborne surveillance hardware – including drones – that the @entity4 once launched from bases inside @entity67			2
' we 're coming to help ' : president @entity11 meets with the @entity96 yesterday in the @entity97 of the @entity98 , hours before his address to the nation in which he vowed to help the thousands of @entity67 civilians being driven from their homes and slaughtered by the @entity102 extremists running rampant through the country			0
that help came in the form of targeted airstrikes on key @entity2 positions today unmanned attacker : the @entity4 has its @entity110 ' drones that can deliver hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles away gone in a cloud of smoke : a dust cloud rises where the first @entity4 bomb struck @entity2 artillery being towed by a truck outside @entity18 the airstrike marked the first time @entity4 forces have taken direct action against @entity2 since it began taking control of huge swathes of the @entity125 in addition , the @entity4 commands a detachment of f - 16 fighters in @entity129 , where it has 2,000 troops based , according to a @entity133 official			1
the superpower also has a massive arsenal of @entity136 and @entity138 drones , capable of delivering @entity139 missiles more than 1,100 miles away			0
@entity141 drones can also deliver 500 - pound bombs			2
the @entity4 has around 800 personnel on the ground in @entity67 - but not enough to launch an attack			1
in late june it was announced that the @entity4 was sending another 300 troops to @entity67 to beef up security at its embassy and around @entity150			1
response : on the ground , a @entity19 armoured vehicle rushes towards the site of the @entity4 air strike to meet @entity2 @entity157 tanks : @entity159 fighters are pictured yesterday patrolling their territory in an operation against the @entity2 fighters it does have 10,000 troops in @entity165 and stores millions of rounds of small arms fire , thousands of rounds of tank ammunition , helicopter - fired rockets , machine guns , grenades , flares , sniper rifles , @entity176 and @entity178 rifles			1
@entity179 has a @entity181 base in @entity182 , less than 100 miles from from @entity183 and 650 miles from @entity150			0
@entity184 was built in the mid 1950s and first used in the @entity186 crisis			0
more recently the base was used as a supply post during the @entity67 wars and also used to support the attacks on @entity190 in 2011			0
before intervention in @entity183 was voted down by the @entity193 , this is where the strikes would have come from			0
now it could be used for air drops to the @entity198 tribe who are trapped in the mountains of @entity67 or the @entity179 could share @entity4 bases .			0
