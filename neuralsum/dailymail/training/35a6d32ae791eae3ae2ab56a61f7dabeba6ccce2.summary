women are losing their lead over men in life expectancy as they trade homemaking for careers			1
work stress – and related drinking and smoking – are taking an increasing toll on their health , according to the @entity10			1
in 1963 men were twice as likely to die early as women			1
last year however the increased risk fell to one and a half times and the life expectancy gap has fallen from six years to fewer than four			1
‘ ministers want women to work long hours when they have children , but these figures … indicates there may be public health problems as a result , ’ said @entity35 of the pressure group mothers at @entity37			0
‘ there is clearly now a health interest in providing transferable tax allowances that would make it possible for people to stay at home with young children			0
’ higher premature death rates for women were most marked in the 55 to 69 age group , the paper found			2
‘ increases in women entering the labour force over the last 50 years are considered to have had an impact on stress , smoking and drinking , leading to changes in the health of females , ’ said the @entity10			1
it said male health had improved with lower smoking and drinking rates and fewer dangerous jobs in industrial environments			1
two years ago @entity10 research found for the first time since the @entity74 age that mortality rates were not improving among some groups of working women			1
they cited the ‘ intermediate ’ group that includes saleswomen , counter clerks , clerical workers in the public sector and medical and dental technicians			0
women have always enjoyed greater life expectancy			0
but in recent years , while overall life expectancy has been rising , the gap between the sexes has been closing			2
life expectancy for a child born between 2011 and 2013 went up to 78.9 for a boy and 82.7 for a girl , leaving a gap between the sexes of 3.8 years			1
women 's health has been adversely affected by growing numbers entering the labour market , and smoking and drinking , the @entity10 said the move towards millions of women going out to work ' has had a negative impact on their health ' however in the early 1980s life expectancy at birth was 70.8 for a boy and 76.8 for a girl – a gap of six years			1
in 1963 life expectancy at birth was 67.9 for a boy and 73.9 for a girl			0
since then there has been an increase of around 11 years for men and nearly nine years for women			2
women have been increasingly likely to adopt risky habits to the same level as men			0
in the mid- 1970s , half of all men smoked but only four in ten women			0
by 2011 overall numbers of smokers had dropped , but women smoked nearly as much as men – 19 per cent against 21 per cent			2
state surveys also show that while levels of drinking are falling overall , they are falling at a slower rate for women than men			1
in 2011 , 57 per cent of men were drinking at least once a week , against 54 per cent of women , with the gap halved over a period of just six years			1
smoking and drinking levels have risen with the advance of women into working lives , a revolution in the lives of millions which has also resulted in women marrying later in life , if at all			2
the average age at which a woman has a child is now over 30 , and numbers of women having children in their 40s has risen fivefold since the 1970s			0
some analysts link higher stress levels in working women with the sharp rise in numbers who go to work while they have young families			2
official figures this year showed the number of stay - at - home mothers has dropped to just over two million , down from three million 20 years ago			0
researcher and author @entity168 said : ‘ men ’s life expectancy has been increasing in the way that could be predicted , because of less going down coal mines or falling off scaffolding			0
‘ however government policies that have put pressure on women to work , whether they want to or not , may not have been entirely a good thing			0
we may be looking at the unintended consequences of the economic pressure on women to go out to work throughout their lives			0

increasing numbers of women have joined the labour market over 50 years
@entity10 says this has lead to more stress , smoking and drinking by women
in 1963 , mortality rates among men were at twice the rate for women
by 2013 , the gap had *narrowed* markedly to just *1.5* times , study shows
