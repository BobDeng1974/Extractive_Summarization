the referee should have stopped it at half - time			2
anyone who has seen that football match knows it should n’t have been close			0
‘ but it ’s not about what you deserve , it ’s about what you actually get			0
this could be a vital point come the end of the season			0
when you ’re going so late into the game and @entity40 ’s had to pull that one out of the bag , we ’re grateful for that			2
’ @entity44 was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from @entity47 , having twice led , initially through @entity49 ’ header			1
@entity0 equalised with a deflected shot before putting @entity1 ahead before the break with a cool finish			1
defender @entity53 levelled the game with a header before @entity56 struck and @entity0 scored his seventh goal in five @entity1 games to ensure honours finished even			1
@entity0 was @entity1 's star man , twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at @entity47 @entity9 had scored late on for @entity6 as they looked to claim and unlikely away end in the @entity63 @entity44 praised @entity0 , saying : ‘ he is a formidable player			1
when you are playing against people that can pull out that little bit of magic , sometimes you have to hold your hands up			0
his free - kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper , who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it			1
’ the @entity6 head coach added : ‘ based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you have n’t been able to get above the line , which was the aim before we started the last two games			2
we showed tonight we ’re more than capable of doing that			0
i do n’t know what we need but we ’re probably going to have to win three games			0
we know our next home games will be very important			0
we have the potential cup final against @entity91 on the last game of the season			0
@entity6 head coach @entity44 called @entity0 a ' formidable player ' after he took apart the visitors @entity8 and @entity44 embrace before kick - off having spent periods of their careers working together ‘ any team would take being in it right till the end and then roll the dice			1
you do n’t want to become detached where every game is a mountain to climb			0
there is a belief in the camp they are capable of surviving , there is no doom and gloom			0
’ @entity8 added : ‘ we ’re creating chances , are n’t we ? i ca n’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before i came in , incredible really for players with that kind of strike - rate ... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back			1
otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble			0
’ @entity8 now takes his team to @entity125 and @entity126			2
‘ who is to say we ca n’t go to any of those games and win ? ’ he said			0
we ca n’t do what @entity6 have done today , we ’ll play on the front foot			2
