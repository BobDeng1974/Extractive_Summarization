a jet skier who saved the life of a little girl when she drifted half - a - mile out to sea on a boogie board says he only did what anyone else would have done			1
@entity8 was on the beach at @entity10 , @entity11 , when he heard @entity12 , the girl 's mother , frantically screaming			1
the 52 - year - old hopped onto his jet ski and found little @entity16 relaxing on her boogie board half - a - mile from the shore			1
' i just told the woman to trust me , and that we would find her			2
the mother jumped on the back of the jet ski with me and we headed out of the harbour			1
' i just did what anyone would have done			2
' i 'm no hero			0
' when the mother said " i do n’t know how to thank you ’ i just told her ‘ do n’t let it happen again			2
" ' the @entity41 pilot added : ' she was a hell of a long way out			2
' she was four years old and could n’t exactly wave for help			0
' she would have been even further out if we had n’t got to her when we did			0
' thankfully the jet ski is so fast we were able to find her and get her out really quickly			1
she was oblivious to what was going on			0
' relief : her mother @entity50 ( pictured ) panicked as she looked back at the shore to see @entity16 was missing desperate search : the family raised the alarm on @entity56 , @entity11			1
a jet skier powered out to sea to find her mrs @entity12 lost sight of the four - year - old when she went swimming in the sea , leaving her daughter in the shallow water with her siblings and cousins			1
when she returned , the child was a speck on the horizon after drifting off on the board			2
when mr @entity8 and mrs @entity12 reached her , @entity16 was oblivious to how far she 'd gone			1
@entity16 and her three siblings spent three nights staying with their aunt @entity72 and her two children at her home in @entity11 last week			1
the families had spent most of wednesday afternoon playing in the sea at @entity56 when the women decided to swim around the harbour			1
but when they returned to where @entity16 had been playing with cousins @entity80 , ten , @entity82 , six , and siblings @entity84 , eight , @entity85 , six , and @entity86 , two , they realised she was missing			1
mrs @entity12 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , said : ‘ i was only gone a short while and as i came back i realised @entity16 was n’t with the others on the shore line			1
‘ i asked the children where she was and they all pointed at this speck on the horizon			0
it honestly just looked like a buoy which was floating out at sea			0
she had gone well beyond the sea wall and out really far			0
playing around : @entity16 ( pictured on a previous holiday ) had been playing in the sea with her five cousins water baby : the four - year - old , from @entity104 , loves body boarding in @entity11 , where her family lives ‘ it was amazing			1
this man just appeared by my side as i was starting to panic and before i knew what had happened i was on the back of his jet ski , off towards her			1
‘ my heart rate is still coming down from it all			0
i still ca n’t believe how lucky we were			0
’ she said @entity16 had not realised how much danger she was in			2
‘ she thought she had n’t gone that far , when we got there i saw her eyes widen when she realised just how far the shore line was			0
‘ it could have been a lot worse had she realised how far out she was , she could have panicked , lost her board and who knows what might have happened			0
‘ she was never in any difficulty , i think she was just in a very relaxed state , she had her board , a life jacket and a wetsuit on			0
‘ i think the combination of high tides and strong sea winds swept her out that far			0
it apparently happened in a matter of minutes , one minute she was there , the next she was n’t			0
’ appeal : the family , from @entity104 , are now appealing to find the jet skier that saved @entity16 in @entity56 , @entity11 , so they can thank him mrs @entity12 said she now regrets leaving the children alone , albeit for just a few minutes			1
‘ i think i was lulled into a false sense of security because they were just paddling in the really shallow water , ’ she said			1
‘ in hindsight , because of that i made the poor decision to go for a swim myself and my attention was not as focused as it should have been			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity16 ’s realised the full impact of what could have happened , she was more excited about the jet ski ride			1
that was the highlight of her holiday			0
we are so thankful to that man , it could have been so much worse if it had n’t been for him			0
‘ i realised when i got back to the shore and made sure she was ok ... i never thanked him properly			2
i ’d love to be able to do that			0
’ mrs @entity72 , 43 , who lives on @entity11 , said : ‘ we spotted this dot off the headland – we could n’t even make out it was a body but it was her			2
‘ she ’d floated right around the corner , far too far out to swim			0
‘ luckily , there was a man on a jet ski nearby			1
he did n’t shout at us for being bad parents – he jumped on his jet ski with my sister and zoomed off			1
‘ i do n’t think the kids really realised quite how serious the situation was			0
they were in fits of giggles and thought it was marvellous that their mummy was on a jet ski			1
’ no one is sure how far @entity16 would have been swept out had she not been rescued so quickly , but her shaken mother said ‘ the tide and the current were definitely against her ’			2
she added that although there had been a lifeguard on duty , ‘ he was a little way from where we were ’			0
mrs @entity12 is a qualified paediatrician who now looks after her children full - time			2
her husband , @entity192 , a cosmetic surgeon , was at work while his family were at the seaside .			2
