by @entity1 reporter published : 18:23 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 28 march 2012 the lead detective investigating @entity4 's death said his killer should have been arrested , but was told there would not be enough evidence to successfully prosecute			1
@entity8 , of @entity10 's @entity9 , said he believed @entity11 should be charged with manslaughter for the february shooting of the unarmed 17 - year - old in a gated community			1
but the local state attorney overruled him , saying there was not enough evidence to convict him of the crime , which carries a maximum 15 - year sentence			1
scroll down for appeal video from @entity23 singer @entity22 dispute : the lead detective on the case believed @entity11 , right , should be arrested for manslaughter in the killing of @entity4 ( left ) speaking out : @entity4 's parents , @entity30 and @entity31 , talked about their son 's death at a public forum sponsored by @entity35 on @entity36 @entity37 made the startling revelation , citing anonymous sources who leaked information about the initial hours of the investigation of the shooting			1
if true , it shows that not all law enforcement officers agreed that @entity11 should go free after he invoked @entity10 's @entity45 and claimed to have killed the teen in self - defence			2
the fact that @entity11 was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations			0
tens of thousands of protesters across the country have marched at rallies supporting @entity4			2
@entity11 told police he was approached and ' sucker - punched ' by @entity4 on february 26 after he followed the boy returning home to his father 's home			1
new picture : this image taken from a @entity64 account that reportedly belonged to @entity4 , shows an older image of the teen - just as new reporting is casting a different light on his behaviour protests : the killing of @entity4 has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country , like this one in front of the @entity75 on tuesday he said after @entity4 knocked @entity11 to the ground , breaking his nose , the teen jumped on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times			1
but apparently mr @entity8 did not entirely buy @entity11 's version of events			1
@entity11 's lawyer said police took him to the station house and questioned him for several hours the night of the shooting , despite his request to go to the hospital			2
one likely source of the state attorney 's reluctance to charge @entity11 is the controversial @entity45 in @entity10			1
it allows anyone to use deadly force to defend themselves if they have a reasonable belief that they are about to be killed or severely injured			0
justice for @entity4 : @entity4 's parents , centre , are led out of a @entity103 by @entity104 ( left ) and rep @entity105 ( right ) reforms : @entity109 , acting @entity108 , @entity10 , took questions at a press conference announcing a plan to hire outside oversight for the department ' @entity116 is one portion of justifiable use of deadly force , ' top prosecutor @entity115 told @entity37			1
the @entity120 , a conservative news site , has published 152 pages of tweets it says were copied from @entity4 's @entity64 account before it was taken @entity126 is a small sample of the messages by a user with the handle ' @ no_limit_n * * * a ' sent and received in the months before @entity4 's death : ( from a cousin ) : @entity132 ai n't tell me yu swung on a bus driver @entity136			1
. @entity140 glock 40 's ... b * * * * you got 80 problems @entity142 ( i 'm fixing to ) smoke 1 wit my dawg @entity144 so daisha think she a boss cuz she walkd in class late 2day ...			2
i do that everyday @entity150 stuff u jus got ta tak 2 da grav w / u @entity154 release 2day			0
no skool 2maro > > > > > > > > > > ' and what that means is that the state must go forward and be able to prove it 's case beyond a reasonable doubt ... so it makes the case in general more difficult than a normal criminal case			2
' yesterday , @entity4 's parents spoke briefly before a @entity35 - only congressional panel as cameras clicked noisily in front of them			1
many in the crowd , which filled the seats and lined the walls , strained to catch a glimpse of them			0
' @entity4 was our son , but @entity4 is your son , ' @entity31 , @entity4 's mother , told the panel			1
' a lot of people can relate to our situation and it breaks their heart like it breaks our heart			0
' @entity4 's father , @entity30 , thanked ' everyone who is holding the legacy of @entity4			1
' ' @entity4 is sadly missed and we will continue to fight for justice for him , ' he said			2
during the two - hour forum , the lawmakers and witnesses openly criticized the police investigation of the shooting and the failure of police to arrest the admitted shooter , @entity11			0
earlier in the day , house speaker @entity196 , a @entity197 , said ' clearly what happened is in fact a tragedy			0
' but he steered clear of calling for @entity11 's arrest as some lawmakers have done			0
' it 's being investigated by state and federal officials , which i think is appropriate , ' said @entity196			2
the development 's came days after new details emerged about @entity11 's criminal past			0
in july 2005 , the then 21 - year - old was arrested at a university bar when he became involved in a scuffle with state alcohol agents			2
as one of his friends was being arrested for serving underage drinkers , @entity11 started becoming verbally abusive and pushed an agent			0
he was arrested after a scuffle ensued but avoided conviction by entering a pretrial - diversion programme			0
a month later , court records show , a woman filed a petition for an injunction against @entity11 , citing domestic violence			0
records show injunctions were later issued in both cases			0
in 2006 he was charged with speeding , but the case was dismissed when the prosecuting officer failed to show up in court			0
and in 2008 he was pursued for a number of unpaid credit card debts which were eventually resolved			0

but state attorney overruled him , saying there not enough evidence
