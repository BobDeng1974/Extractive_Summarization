by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 10 december 2013 there are several ways to survive an avalanche - hold onto something and pray , ' swim ' in the direction of the snow ... or be a mountain goat			2
that certainly helped these light - footed animals after they were faced with a wall of snow hurtling down a mountainside in the @entity14 @entity13 last week			1
incredible footage from a helicopter over @entity17 near @entity18 shows nine chamois goats having to think fast as the avalanche heads towards them			1
as the ' runners ' nimbly hot - hoof it over the cascading snow to safety , the hapless four disappear under a white sheet , much to the dismay of the helicopter crew			2
their commentary is in @entity14 , but the sheer emotion in the voices as they cry ' @entity53 , ay , ay ! ' dispenses with the need for @entity55			1
and just when all seems lost , two , three , then all four buried goats emerge and rush off to join the rest of the group			0
battered , possibly ; bruised , maybe			0
in october , two climbers in the region suffered mild injuries while climbing the glacier du @entity64			0
they were just below the summit ridge at 3,500 meters when they triggered a slab of snow			0
but what 's this ? two of the animals emerge from under the wall of snow ! four ! amazingly , the ' @entity74 ' goats live again and race to re-join the herd @entity78 of danger , the nine are reunited , and they certainly have something to bleat about high on a hill stood a lonely goat : a chamois surveys its kingdom			1

high *drama* at @entity17 in the @entity14 @entity13
