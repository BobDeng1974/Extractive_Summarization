the prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 as jails struggle to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders			1
the @entity4 today predicted the number of prisoners in @entity7 and @entity8 will rise every year until the end of the decade , despite predicting a fall just 12 months ago			1
@entity12 branded the u-turn a sign of ' utter incompetence ' but @entity17 minister @entity16 said it was proof that on his watch ' criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer '			1
however , under ' @entity32 ' which includes the possibility of more criminals being jailed and judges handing down longer sentences , the prison population could hit 98,900 by 2020 - a 15 per cent increase			1
when the same forecasts were published last year , the @entity4 expected the prison population to fall from 83,400 to 81,000 by 2019			1
it means thousands more prison places will be needed , because the current capacity is only 88,015			2
@entity12 's shadow justice secretary @entity42 said : ' today 's data exposes the utter incompetence of @entity45			1
' it is embarrassing that they are having to throw in the bin previous projections due to a prisons crisis of their own making			0
it is humiliating for the government but will be costly to taxpayers			0
' what this latest revelation shows is that @entity16 has lost control of the prison system			1
not only are prisons more overcrowded and violent , with less rehabilitation taking place , but they are storing up monumental problems at huge expense for the future because of their incompetence			2
' officials say the sharp change in direction comes after a rise in recent months in the number of people being handed custodial sentences			2
' despite the fact that overall crime is falling there has been an increase in recorded crime for certain offence types , ' the @entity4 said			1
in particular , in the wake of high profile cases of sex abuse including @entity82 , prosecutions for sexual offences are the highest in the decade			0
the number of cases increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months ending june 2014			0
among celebrities jailed in recent months are broadcaster @entity89 , who is serving a total of five years in prison for sex offences , and entertainer @entity93 , who was handed a sentence of five years and nine months in july this year			1
@entity17 justice secretary @entity16 said the rising forecasts were proof that on his watch ' criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer ' celebrities serving prison sentences for sex offences include @entity89 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) sex offenders are also being jailed for longer , with average sentences increasing by 2.4 months to almost six years when compared to 2013			1
cases of violence against the person have also risen , leading to more attackers being imprisoned			0
justice secretary @entity16 said : ' some people are n't in favour of sending offenders to prison			2
i 'm not one of them , and i think the public will be reassured by the fact that under this @entity117 criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer			2
' we will always have enough places for those sent to us by the courts			0
by 2015 this government will have increased the adult male prison capacity			0
we will have many more places than we inherited from the previous government			0
' i remain committed to modernising the prison estate so that it delivers best value for hardworking taxpayers			0
' the projections published today do not take into account any new laws which might be passed by future governments after the next election , which means they ' become less certain over time ' .			0

numbers behind bars will rise from 85,925 now to 90,200 in june 2020
but if judges continue to increase sentences , figure could top 98,900
just a year ago @entity4 forecast prison population would fall
@entity12 *accuses* ministers of ' utter incompetence ' in the prison service
but @entity17 @entity16 says more criminals are being jailed on his watch
