the pain goes on for @entity1			2
this was the game they knew they needed to win , but instead it ended with a fifth successive defeat and the prospect of a demoralising autumn campaign			1
after last week ’s fourth straight loss to world champions @entity13 , @entity11 ’s national team were well aware of the urgent need for a result to ease growing pressure			0
instead , they were beaten at home once more and their long wait for a victory over @entity22 – a feat last achieved in 2006 – goes on			0
this was a shattering outcome and will leave @entity1 to clutch at straws again			0
elements of their performance were impressive – particularly their driving maul which yielded two tries , their scrum and the exploits of their ball - carrying no 8s ; first @entity36 and then @entity37			1
@entity38 also made regular in - roads from full - back			2
the result was everything and it eluded them			0
just 10 months from now , @entity1 will go into a home @entity109 and their ambition was to have turned @entity112 into a ‘ fortress ’ by then			0
instead , it is a venue where the southern giants do not arrive with trepidation			0
while a selection reshuffle and a game against @entity120 next week may generate much - needed hope and confidence , the key pointers are the @entity123 against the @entity125 countries and @entity1 are struggling against them			2
the showdown with @entity127 on november 29 now looms as a fixture of colossal significance			0
lose that one and this will have been a disastrous november series			0
@entity1 had been anticipating good weather for this match , but in fact there was a long spell of pre-match rain which made conditions difficult for handling			2
there was moisture in the air and also on the emotional face of @entity36			0
the @entity145 was in tears during the anthem – signifying the importance of this game to him personally and to the home team as a whole			0
@entity154 ’s men had much to improve from last week , but they made a dazzling start against the @entity13 and they were similarly dynamic from the off this time			0
an early lineout catch and drive allowed @entity56 and @entity55 to release @entity53 , who made a nimble half - break , only to knock on in the tackle			1
@entity55 was another of the @entity1 players who needed to raise his game after an off - colour display against @entity13			1
however , the fly - half left his team scrambling desperately in the 10th minute when he attempted to counter-attack from his own 22 and release @entity51 , but the @entity22 flooded the ruck , won turn - over ball and so nearly scored a try in the left corner			1
as it was , they were awarded a penalty which @entity80 kicked for a 3 - 0 lead			2
shortly afterwards , the visitors surged further ahead as @entity56 suffered a calamity on his 50th @entity123 appearance			2
@entity1 were patiently probing in the opposition half when the scrum - half had a pass intercepted by @entity45 , who raced clear to score at the posts and @entity80 converted			1
a 10 - point deficit represented an @entity184 crisis and @entity38 responded in fine style , with a scorching midfield break from a high kick , but he was stopped by @entity81 on the @entity22 ’ 22 and the move broke down			2
then in the 24th minute , @entity1 should have had hit back with a try , only to fluff their opportunity			0
@entity56 seized on a ruck turn - over and broke to the right and the ball was worked to @entity60 who galloped clear			1
but the big @entity196 lock did n’t release @entity51 when he had a clear run to the line and by the time he took a tackle and off - loaded , the space had been closed up			1
@entity54 went close on the other flank , but a glorious opening had been squandered @entity22 centre @entity45 runs away for the first try of the match after intercepting the pass of @entity56 @entity1 's @entity53 takes on @entity22 's @entity80 as the centre makes his full international debut @entity22 ' forwards engulf @entity1 's @entity36 after he takes the ball from a lineout @entity55 adds two points after the try of @entity59 to make his tally two penalties and two conversions before being replaced a break from @entity1 full back @entity38 is halted by try - scorer @entity45 @entity22 celebrate @entity81 's first international try in his first start for the @entity22 in the first minute of the second half @entity1 83 ( 2 ) 107 388 5 1 28 14 13 4/4 19/20 80/89 58 % 60 % tackles ( missed ) carries metres clean breaks offloads kicks ( hand ) turnovers pens against scrums won lineouts won @entity228 possession territory @entity231 123 ( 20 ) 77 217 2 4 34 14 15 3/3 13/13 60/63 42 40 for the remainder of the first half , the game became disjointed and attritional , with both captains warned by referee @entity236 about deliberately collapsing mauls			1
@entity1 had the advantage in the scrum , but they could n’t make a dent in @entity22 ’s imperious lineout and the @entity22 were causing problems for the hosts at the breakdown			1
a penalty by @entity55 put his team on the scoreboard and after @entity80 had struck back at the other end , the @entity1 no 10 added another kick to ensure it was a one - score game going into the break			1
any up - turn in optimism among home supporters was shattered seconds after the re-start , as @entity22 conjured a sensational try			2
as @entity1 ’s defence came up fast , @entity80 ’s clever kick over the top was taken by @entity76 and the full back burst into the 22 before a brilliant back - hand off - load sent @entity81 away to touch down			1
three minutes later , just as they were staring down the barrel , @entity1 were given renewed hope			0
another powerful rolling maul was dragged by down the @entity22 and @entity86 was shown the yellow card			1
a week earlier , @entity154 ’s side had been unable to capitalise when the @entity13 were reduced to 14 men , but this time they rallied strongly			0
their driving game was causing chaos and from the penalty they kicked to the corner , took the lineout cleanly and the pack surged in - field , forcing @entity59 over for his maiden @entity123 try			1
@entity55 duly added the extras			0
the same method created another @entity184 try three minutes later , as @entity22 ’s depleted forwards were marched back through their 22 before @entity37 – on for @entity36 – twisted free and pounded through three defenders to score			2
@entity280 converted and @entity1 were on terms			0
@entity86 was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee @entity236 @entity38 takes a high ball and is tackled in the air by @entity22 's full back @entity76 @entity1 full back @entity38 pushes his @entity291 counterpart @entity292 @entity59 crosses for @entity1 as the hosts make @entity22 pay following the sin - binning of @entity22 's @entity86 @entity1 's @entity37 twists in the tackle to get the ball down for @entity1 's second try another try for the @entity1 forwards comes from @entity37 as the home side make the most of the one - man advantage yet , parity was short - lived , as @entity22 responded in kind			1
their pack had been under the cosh , but they delivered another strong maul from an attacking lineout and @entity88 charged down the blindside to strike in the corner			0
@entity80 could n’t convert from the wide angle , but he added a penalty 13 minutes from time			2
by then , @entity1 had lost @entity58 to the sin - bin , after the hooker was adjudged to have trampled on @entity89 at the bottom of a maul			1
they were also hampered by the fact that @entity55 was clearly in pain , but the coaches appeared reluctant to remove him			0
eventually , @entity70 was brought on and his 68th - minute penalty put @entity1 in range of their rivals , but they kept succumbing to execution errors and disciplinary lapses , and a @entity80 drop goal appeared to put the result beyond doubt			1
in fact , @entity52 ’s try at the end of a sustained onslaught revived faint hope , but there was no time left for the hosts to snatch the result they so desperately craved			0
@entity1 captain @entity46 converses with referee @entity236 during their test at @entity112 @entity58 walks from the pitch after being sin - binned following @entity342 's chat with his @entity343 @entity1 lock @entity61 charges down the kick of @entity80 @entity11 's side must now regroup ahead of next week 's clash with @entity120 @entity56 leads @entity1 onto the field as the scrum half marks his 50th test match against @entity22			1

@entity1 fall to fifth successive defeat and are *winless* from their opening two @entity353
@entity1 trailed @entity22 6 - 13 at half - time with two penalties each for @entity55 and @entity80
@entity45 's intercept try was the only five - pointer of a first half that saw both sides pay for mistakes
@entity1 scored two tries though @entity59 and @entity37 after the sin - binning of @entity86
@entity58 was yellow - carded after @entity342 *conferred* with the @entity343 after an *incident* in the ruck
@entity88 scored in the corner for the @entity22 then @entity52 crossed late for @entity1
@entity51 made full debut for @entity1 while scrum half @entity56 played his 50th test
