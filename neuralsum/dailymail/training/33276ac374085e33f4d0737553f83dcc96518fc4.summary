by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 forget coach - speak about technique and the biomechanics of bowling			2
the best piece of advice @entity7 ever received was a typically blunt message from @entity10 when he joined @entity11 less than two years ago			1
‘ i met him when i first signed and he just said ‘ do n’t think , just bowl ’ and walked off , ’ said the @entity13 man whose career was reborn at @entity15			1
‘ that ’s all he said to me and i have n’t spoken to him since			2
but it makes sense when i think about it now			0
i bowl best when i do n’t think too much about it			2
’ @entity7 , now 29 , had plenty of time to think about a career that had promised far more than it had delivered before he was called up for his 10th test last week seven years after his ninth and what seemed final game at the highest level			1
under @entity11 ’s @entity54 coach @entity53 , who elaborated on @entity10 ’s simple message and gave @entity7 his head , he has become the 90 mph plus bowler @entity43 hope can be their answer to @entity60			1
now , after impressing in the first @entity61 at @entity64 ’s more than his two wickets on a pitch that could not have suited him less would suggest , he will take on @entity40 on his home ground tomorrow eager to take his belated chance			1
‘ to play in that first test was massive for me , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i was young when i first played for @entity43 and i did n’t know my game too well			1
i would turn up day after day just hoping for the best but i ’ve got clarity in my role now			0
‘ i did n’t really know what kind of bowler i was back then			2
was i a pitch it and up and swing it bowler ? a seamer ? but i know what i am now			2
i run in and hit the pitch hard and back myself to do that			0
‘ on different days different things will be needed but i ca n’t imagine @entity43 have brought me in to be an 80 mph swinger			1
they ’ve brought me in to bowl quick and be aggressive			2
i love that role for @entity11 and if that ’s what @entity43 want me to do then i ’m more than happy to do it			1
’ say what you mean ! @entity10 's ( r ) advice to @entity7 was simply , ' do n't think , just bowl ! ' so what went wrong last time , when @entity90 called up a raw but quick @entity13 bowler who then , so the theory goes , was messed up by too much technical advice and tinkering with his basic action ? were the coaches culpable ? ‘ different coaches told me different things and when you ’re a youngster you ’re like a sponge and take a lot of things in , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i think you learn when you ’re older to filter stuff			0
if it ’s good advice you can keep it and take it with you but if it ’s not you can say no thanks			2
‘ i can blame others but i went to people saying ‘ what am i doing wrong ? ’ and ‘ what do i need to work on ? ’ so i have to blame myself as well but when you take a lot in it all becomes a bit too much			0
speed demon : @entity7 impressed with the two wickets he took at the first test against @entity40 ‘ each day i would turn up and try to do something different			1
i ’d work on my front arm one day and my back leg the next so that if i performed well i did n’t know where it came from			0
i ’d just go back to training not sure what i was doing			0
now i ’m a bit older and a bit smarter and i do appreciate what i ’ve been through			0
i appreciate being here with @entity43 a lot more now than i did then			1
’ it was the short move from @entity13 to @entity11 for a @entity133 boy who could have joined either as a teenager that proved the key to his second coming			1
‘ i would have loved to have played more for @entity43 , maybe approaching my 100th test like @entity139 , but it was n’t meant to be and that ’s my fault , ’ he said			1
‘ there were things that i did outside of cricket ( @entity7 has twice been banned for drink driving )			1
i was n’t consistent enough in my training			0
‘ there have been ups and downs , but coming to @entity11 was the best thing i could ever have done			0
i had a year left on my contract at @entity13 but i wanted to move because , it ’s like any job , you can feel a bit stale			1
i ’d fallen out of love with cricket really but i ’m playing for fun again now and as soon as i did that the results started coming			0
’ matured : @entity7 claims he is ' older and smarter ' than when he last played @entity61 cricket in 2007 the most important spectator at @entity15 tomorrow for @entity7 is his father @entity162 , who will be travelling down from @entity133 for the occasion			2
seven years ago @entity164 turned down his son ’s offer of a kidney when he became ill because he was worried how it would affect his cricket			0
now fully recovered he is just back in time from a holiday in @entity171 to see his son play			0
‘ @entity173 did n’t take my kidney because he wanted to me to play for @entity43 , ’ added @entity7			1
‘ he was on dialysis for quite a few years and that can be tedious			0
eventually a new kidney came up and he ’s fine now			0
he ’s been on holiday and he ’s healthy			0
he said to me the other day ‘ i honestly thought you ’d never play for @entity43 again but you ’ve proved me wrong			2
’ i ’m upset he did n’t back me …			0
’ the last line is said with the smile of a man who has found contentment after going round the block a few times in county cricket and in life			0
it would be a big surprise if @entity7 is not a success with @entity43 this time			1
* @entity61 , the specialist bank and asset manager , is the title sponsor of @entity195 in @entity43			2
