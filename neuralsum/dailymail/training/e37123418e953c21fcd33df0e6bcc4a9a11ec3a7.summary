by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 and @entity2 scored as @entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 0			2
@entity5 must see a doctor to ascertain the extent of a groin injury that forced him to go off with a grimace at half - time of @entity3 ’ friendly with @entity4 in @entity12			1
it gives @entity14 cause for concern with their @entity18 opener against @entity19 less than ten days away			1
the @entity21 boss said the problem could have got worse had @entity23 stayed on and added : ‘ he has to wait until the doctor sees him			2
it was better than you do n’t risk a bigger injury by playing him in the second as it was not the most important match			1
injury scare : @entity3 striker @entity5 was taken off at half time with a potential groin injury assist : @entity23 's first - half shot was parried into the path of @entity1 who opened the scoring tussle : @entity23 fights for the ball with @entity41 of @entity4 at the @entity42 ‘ it looks slight injury but it is not for nothing that you go off			1
’ @entity48 said he ‘ hoped ’ the @entity50 striker , who was not 100 per cent fit in any case after missing six weeks towards the end of last season with a knee injury , would be fit for the @entity19 game			1
@entity23 tried to play down the scare last night and said : ‘ i came off as a precaution			2
it built up during the came so decided it was sensible to come off			2
’ @entity23 ’s importance to his country was illustrated by the way their attack became blunted in the second half , although his replacement @entity2 did score a tap - in with 14 minutes to go to make the final score 2 - 0			2
@entity1 had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a @entity23 shot			0
@entity4 manager @entity74 will be warmed by the way his team , without @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , tested the hosts at times and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple of openings been finished more accurately			1
much was made in the build - up to this game of @entity48 ’s decision to switch to a 5 - 3 - 2 system from @entity3 ’s usual 4 - 3 - 3			0
he trialled it in their previous friendly against @entity93 last saturday prompting @entity94 , the man who led his nation to the @entity18 final four years ago , to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the tournament starting			1
decisive : @entity1 scored one and made one for @entity3 in their win against @entity4 number one : @entity1 celebrates after giving @entity3 a first - half lead against @entity4 in @entity12 there might be more sniping to come given @entity48 sprung a surprise by opting for a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond formation here			0
with @entity1 , @entity23 and @entity110 purring , as was the case last night , their positioning should n’t matter though			0
in the 25th minute @entity1 played a one - two with @entity110 then jinked past @entity112 only to continue tip - toeing too long so when he fired his shot @entity41 was able to clear off the line			0
in the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger			0
@entity23 beat @entity116 on the left and cracked a shot that @entity119 could only divert into the path of @entity1 who struck instantly			0
@entity23 could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just wide after being teed up by @entity124			0
it was to be the last act in his game , replaced at half - time by @entity129 with cameras picking up a wince that will make @entity21 fans do just the same			0
the @entity133 forward did add gloss to @entity3 ’s win by slotting in at the far post after a perfect cross from @entity1 , released by @entity110 , but it is clear any absence of @entity23 will cast a huge shadow			0
@entity74 said : ‘ you never like to lose but i do n’t think we could have one much more			0
we put the effort in and we were up against a really good outfit with a top manager			1
we showed courage , bravery and stayed strong and we gave them a really good test before they head off to the @entity18			1
’ point the way : @entity152 gets his message across to his players during @entity3 training bright hope : @entity3 will be relying on @entity23 's goals to fire them to success in @entity160 high flyer : @entity5 ( centre ) has scored against @entity163 and @entity164 after returning to fitness			1
