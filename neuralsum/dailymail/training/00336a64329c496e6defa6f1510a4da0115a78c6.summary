@entity6 said the shops would continue to trade but the first closures were expected in a month 's time			1
the 66 stores earmarked for closure employ 930 staff and make up more than a quarter of the chain 's high street shops			1
cuts : administrators @entity6 said today that they hoped the brand had a future as a ' restructured business ' the 66 stores identified for closure by @entity3 's administrators are : @entity23 - under - @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 - upon - @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity48 @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 – @entity46 , @entity53 – @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity60 @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 90 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 - on - @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 @entity92 has been particularly hard hit with all five of @entity48 's stores closing			1
three stores will also close in @entity53			1
administrator @entity95 said the shops had been identified as part of an ongoing review of the company 's financial position and the group still hoped to secure a future for the restructured business			1
he said : ' this step has been taken in order to enhance the prospects of securing the business ' future as a going concern			2
' we continue to receive strong support from staff and are extremely grateful to them for their commitment during an understandably difficult period			2
' ' execution ' : tweets from @entity3 's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting recently the group , which currently has 220 @entity125 stores , called in the administrators last month , but hopes of a rescue deal have been raised after restructuring firm @entity129 - the group behind @entity132 - bought the company 's debt			1
@entity133 , @entity134 mp for @entity135 , tweeted her concerns about the closure of all the city 's stores			1
' news that all @entity3 stores in @entity48 will close is devastating for workers , ' she said			1
' thoughts are with them today			2
' its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping			2
recently , the internet caused further problems for the struggling chain – when staff hijacked the firm ’s @entity153 account to post a blow - by - blow account of mass sackings at head office			2
angry staff gave live updates of the ‘ mass execution ’ at the beleaguered music firm ’s @entity162 headquarters			2
around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired			1
the incident triggered panic among @entity3 executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @ hmvtweets feed			2
the first read : ‘ we ’re tweeting live from inside hr where we ’re all being fired ! @entity178 ! ! ’ one minute later came the update : ‘ there are over 60 of us being fired at once ! @entity182 execution of loyal employees who love the brand			0
’ final stand : the rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being ' ruined ' so they had no other choice @entity3 later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later , saying there have been job losses but ' not in our stores ' just looking : supportive @entity153 users praised the courage of the rogue member of staff another followed : ‘ @entity200 overheard our marketing director ( he ’s staying folks ) ask “ how do i shut down twitter ? ”			1
’ one message , spread over two posts , read : ‘ under usual circumstances , we ’d never dare do such a thing as this			0
however , when the company you dearly love is being ruined and those hard working individuals , who wanted to make @entity3 great again , have mostly been fired , there seemed no other choice			0
’ the company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon , however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times			0
@entity218 , who described herself as @entity3 ’s social media planner , said she was behind the tweets			0
@entity221 , @entity222 at @entity3 , was behind the tweets the 21 - year - old said senior managers ‘ never seemed to grasp ’ the importance of social media			0
‘ i hope they ’re finally listening , ’ she said in a message from her personal account			0
‘ since my internship started , i worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance of social media – not as a short - term commercial tool , but as a tool to build and strengthen the customer relationship , and to gain invaluable real - time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over 91 years			0
’ staff at @entity3 , which employs more than 4,000 people , have been afraid for their future since the chain went into administration last month			0
there are hopes that many of the 239 shops and their staff can be saved through a sale of the business to @entity129 , which specialises in rescuing failed brands			0
@entity129 has already purchased @entity3 ’s bank debts , while it is now negotiating to take over the stores			1
its efforts are understood to have the support of a group of music labels and film studios , including @entity261 and @entity262			0
the industry believes it is vital to keep a national chain of entertainment shops on the @entity267 to provide competition to web retailers , such as @entity270 , and the big supermarkets			0
accountants @entity6 have been appointed as administrators and are overseeing the negotiations and the staff dismissals			0
it said there have been just over 100 redundancies at head office locations in @entity162 , @entity280 and @entity31 and around 85 across the distribution network			0
joint administrator @entity95 said of the redundancies : ‘ although such decisions are always difficult , it is a necessary step in restructuring the business to enhance the prospects of securing its future			1
