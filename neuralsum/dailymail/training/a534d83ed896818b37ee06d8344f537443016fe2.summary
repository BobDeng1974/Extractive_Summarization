by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 19 october 2012 @entity1 and @entity3 rugby star @entity2 has told @entity4 to shut up and stick to topics he knows about after the @entity7 manager attacked the conduct of rugby players			1
@entity4 believes footballers are only so heavily criticised for their behaviour because people are jealous – and he singled out rugby players in particular for escaping scrutiny			1
the @entity7 boss said : ‘ i think that football is a volatile contest so people will lose their temper , but nobody seems to highlight the fact that rugby players stamp on each other 's heads , gouge each other 's eyes , and that seems to be acceptable			2
pointing the finger : @entity7 boss @entity4 has questioned the behaviour of rugby players on the defensive : @entity2 was unhappy with @entity4 's comments and told his twitter followers ‘ there ’s a lot of jealousy around the way football is in this country , and as it ’s known as the peoples ’ game , then i think more and more people complain about the price , whereas all the other sports it ’s not quite the same			1
' @entity2 was offended by those comments and the @entity45 – a lifelong @entity47 fan – tweeted : ‘ @entity4 should probably only talk on topics that he knows about and stick to coaching west ham and keep his mouth shut about rugby ... ’ former @entity1 hooker @entity52 also added his weight to the argument , tweeting : ‘ i 'm not jealous mr @entity4			1
i can sit where i want , with a beer & without fear ; the day i ca n't i 'll walk away from rugby not make excuses			0
’ blowing bubbles : @entity4 is not afraid to say what he 's thinking and has been in trouble in the past @entity63 ’s @entity62 added : ‘ @entity4 horribly missing the point			2
respect for officials , fans or just each other sadly lacking in your sport			0
’ the comments from the @entity7 boss come only days after @entity74 back row @entity72 was cited for a brutal assault on prop from @entity79 club @entity77 who he claims tried to gouge him			0
speaking ahead of @entity7 's @entity82 clash against @entity83 on saturday , @entity4 continued : ' fans go to watch ice hockey players beat themselves up with the sticks and that also seems acceptable , but a footballer kicks somebody , or does something that ’s slightly untoward to the rules and it ’s " lock them away , ban them for life "			1
' ‘ so , it ’s something we have to live with			0
in comparing it to the @entity99 , it ’s not as fierce a competition , because there ’s not that day - to - day , week - to - week , competitive edge			0
' it ’s a build - up of four years – a very dedicated four years of course – and the delight of winning and the end of it must be one of the biggest highs anybody ’s ever experienced			0

@entity4 claims fans focus on *violence* in football because they are jealous
former @entity1 hooker @entity52 says at least rugby *supporters* are safe
