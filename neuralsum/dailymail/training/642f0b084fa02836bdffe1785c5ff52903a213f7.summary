@entity46 : it is a long - held idea that pregnant women should eat for two ( pictured posed by model ) under the proposals , parents would receive ‘ healthy eating and lifestyle advice ’ for their toddlers , and family liaison workers based in schools would help encourage children to exercise , eat nutritious food and spend less time in front of the computer or tv			1
