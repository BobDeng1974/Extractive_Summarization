@entity0 hope @entity2 winger @entity1 will fly to their rescue on monday after another dispiriting afternoon of @entity5 football at @entity6			1
@entity0 are desperate for new players and they were in discussions with the @entity10 giants over the details of the 26 - year - old ’s transfer , with @entity2 trying to edge a proposed £ 68million transfer closer to the £ 75m mark at the last minute			1
however , both clubs have a firm desire to get the deal done and @entity1 has already said his goodbyes at the @entity20			1
sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity6 leaves @entity37 ’s team with one point from two games and the scale of the challenge facing the @entity43 veteran is clear			1
@entity44 said : ‘ the players are disappointed because we thought we would win — but still we have one point			1
that is not good enough for @entity0			2
‘ i thought we lost a lot of balls in situations that i would not expect			0
when you lose a lot of balls you have to run after the ball also to win it back			2
you are not in the match			0
that was the first half			0
in the second half we were dominating but you need creative passing in the last third and that was also not so good			0
' we were dominating without creating chances and that is the purpose of the game			0
in @entity68 on tour it ( confidence ) was much better than now			0
we have to improve , but that takes time			0
’ disappointed : @entity37 watched on as his side drew 1 - 1 at @entity6 on sunday hands up if you need new players ! @entity0 are on the hunt for two or three faces to strengthen the squad opener : @entity77 scored the first goal of the game after 17 minutes from close range leveller : before @entity82 equalised with a header from a corner on the half hour mark it just had to be ! @entity87 reject @entity82 enjoyed notching for the @entity6 against @entity0 @entity0 thought they had agreed a deal with @entity89 on saturday night , with the @entity91 champions accepting a £ 60m down - payment with a further £ 8m to add on depending on @entity1 ’s success at @entity94			1
however , @entity2 were on sunday trying to move that fee higher in a game of brinkmanship that both sides — and @entity1 himself — hope will not scupper the deal			1
suggestions that @entity87 are trying to get involved are untrue			0
the @entity5 champions were offered the opportunity to bid last week and declined , despite their admiration for the player			2
@entity1 has told friends and team - mates that he will be moving to @entity94 this week			1
he said his goodbyes at training in @entity2 at the weekend and it remains to be seen if @entity0 can close the transfer			1
sidelined : new signings @entity113 and @entity115 have already found themselves injured hobbled off : whilst @entity117 added to @entity0 's injury concerns when he hobbled off at @entity6 after their draw with @entity6 , @entity44 — without injured new signings @entity113 and @entity115 — said : ‘ when a transfer has been finished , then we can say something			1
but now , you have to wait and see			0
if the moment is there then we will announce it			0
but we are a big club			0
' we have seven injured and now @entity117 ( forced off with a groin strain in the first half ) makes eight , so you always need players			1
’ @entity131 was booked for diving in the second half when he went down under a challenge from @entity135			2
@entity44 , however , was adamant his player had not dived , as he said : ‘ normally it is a penalty			2
he has been touched by the opponent in the 16 - metre area and when it happens like that there are referees who are whistling			2
it is a risk by that ( defending ) player			0
’ tough to take : @entity144 cut a dejected figure as @entity0 failed to register their first win of the season contact ? @entity131 went down in the second half following a tackle from @entity135 simulation : but the midfielder was booked for diving after the referee deemed there was no contact from @entity6 , who are tracking @entity159 ’s former @entity158 forward @entity157 , there was sympathy from manager @entity161 , who still believes @entity0 will finish in the top four			1
‘ they ’re good enough to finish in the top four , ’ said @entity161			0
‘ @entity164 will be there and they are going to spend more			0
