renowned as much for her passionate battle to revive the @entity3 high street as she is for her bright red bob , @entity0 is not a woman to sit back and watch injustices happen			2
particularly when it comes to shopping			2
as she launches her new fashion line for @entity11 , the mother - of - three spoke to @entity13 about her disbelief that women just one year out of their thirties are made to feel ' invisible ' when buying clothes , and why her anger drove her to target women over 40 with her new collection			1

most shops when they are targeting women use 18 - year - old models			1
' what are we doing here ? there must be something unattractive about being old - that 's the message , and i think that 's a really ugly message			1
' i wanted to create a collection that had women of that age in the campaign and which thought about their bodies and the things that are important to them - what we can highlight and what we do n't want to highlight ! ' talking about having the confidence to look good once you 're over a certain age , she said : ' i 'm 53 ! you have permission to push boundaries			1
i call it the mutton moment			2
' it 's when women look in the mirror and think ' can i , ca n't i ? ' we need more women to stand up and say it 's okay ! confidence comes from you having a sense of yourself			1
