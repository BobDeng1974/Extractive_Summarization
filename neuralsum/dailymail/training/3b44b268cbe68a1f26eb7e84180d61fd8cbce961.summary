fast bowler @entity0 admitted to feeling frustrated as @entity1 battled a slow pitch at @entity3 on the second day of the first test against @entity5			1
after four wickets for two runs in the afternoon session , the hosts had @entity5 346 for nine and looked like they would remove the tourists for less than 400			1
slip up : @entity0 ca n't believe it as @entity12 drops @entity5 batsman @entity13 high point : @entity0 , left , celebrates dismissal of @entity5 's @entity16 for one run during day two @entity18 remaining optimistic after tough second day but a final - wicket partnership of 111 from @entity20 ( 58 ) and @entity21 ( 51 not out ) held @entity23 's men up , with the captain departing early as @entity1 reached 43 for one at the close			1
' it was frustrating , but we tried pretty much everything with the ball , ' @entity0 told @entity31			2
' the ball was 50 overs old leading up to the new ball , and it was n't really doing a huge amount			2
there was n't much for length , so it was quite hard to buy a wicket			2
' you were almost hoping for a batsman error and , credit to the 10 and 11 of @entity5 , they did n't give us that error , really			1
' it was frustrating , but actually if you break the day down and the session down , it was 90 for four that session			0
that was actually our best session of the game , but we walked off at tea a little bit frustrated			0
' it 's a good pitch to bat on			0
we stuck to our guns fantastically well - 457 could have been 600 , no question about that			1
' @entity0 is encouraged , however , that groundsman @entity57 took the unusual step of apologising for conditions after day one			0
' i think the best thing that 's happened is @entity3 have come out and said ' look , our mistake ' , and apologised for the pitch			2
' it 's certainly not what @entity1 would have asked for , not what @entity3 would have hoped for			1
' let 's just hope that other grounds do n't follow suit			0
' @entity0 is optmistic about @entity1 's prospects in the first innings			1
trudging off : @entity23 walks off at the end of the @entity5 innings tail wagging : @entity21 plays a shot at the end of the @entity5 innings feeling down : @entity76 looks lies on the floor as @entity5 pile on the runs in the runs : @entity20 and @entity82 both celebrate reaching 50 for @entity5 in the wickets : @entity5 batsman @entity13 is run out by a direct hit from @entity85 ' after day two of our last @entity88 ( at @entity90 ) , i think @entity91 had an eight per cent chance of winning - and they ended up winning , ' the seamer said			1
' a session in test cricket can change it			0
the third day is always the ' moving ' day , a huge one for us			0
' if we can get a good start and build , i 'm sure the @entity100 bowlers wo n't be looking forward to bowling at @entity101 coming in at number eight when you 're a bit tired			0
' we can certainly get a big score if we get our heads down			0
