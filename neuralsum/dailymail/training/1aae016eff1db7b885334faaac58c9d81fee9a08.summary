by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:44 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 and @entity5 founder @entity4 last night showed @entity7 popstar @entity6 how to party - @entity9 style			1

the party at @entity15 's @entity14 restaurant was to celebrate signing the contract for the $ 19 billion sale of @entity5 to @entity9 and the 29th birthday of @entity3 's wife , @entity3			1
over 450 million people using the service each month firm has 50 employees 70 % of those people active on a given day messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom @entity31 volume service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day 600m photos uploaded each day 200m voice messages sent each day @entity3 received a bunch of @entity37 and a cake from @entity0 for her birthday as the couple left the restaurant and got into a heavily guarded chauffeur driven people carrier			2
the party came just hours after @entity3 and @entity4 addressed the @entity46 conference			1
@entity47 discussed long - term plans for a world in which everyone is able to get online during an on - stage interview at the @entity46 in @entity15 , @entity52 on monday			2
the company 's mobile footprint has only expanded with its decision to buy @entity5 , the wildly popular smartphone messaging service , in a surprise deal announced last wednesday			2
while @entity3 spent most of his time discussing @entity60 , the ambitious project that aims to get the world online , he could n't skirt questions about @entity9 's decision to pay a staggering $ 19 billion for @entity5			1
' @entity5 is a great company and a great fit for us , ' @entity3 said , calling the service the " most engaging ' mobile application that has ever existed - and one that 's well worth its price			1
with 465 million monthly members , the service is growing at a faster pace than @entity9 ever has and @entity3 believes @entity5 is on track to reach a billion users			1
it 's because of that potential , and not @entity5 's current revenue stream , that @entity3 thinks @entity5 is worth more than $ 19 billion			1
in comparison , @entity74 which has 241 million users , is worth roughly $ 32 billion , based on its stock price monday			0
even so , @entity9 investors should n't expect a windfall from @entity5 any time soon			2
@entity3 said the acquisition will allow the startup to focus on growing its user base - and not on making money - over the next five years or so			0
@entity3 and wife @entity3 leave the party is a heavily guarded car @entity5 co-founder @entity4 met last night with @entity9 's @entity3 and their respective girlfriends , at @entity88 in @entity15 , where @entity6 also attended new billioaire @entity4 leaves the party that echoes earlier comments from @entity5 ceo @entity4 at the wireless show			1
@entity4 , who announced that @entity5 will soon offer voice calling as it works to lure more users to its service , stressed that his company has no plans to add ' marketing ' or advertising to the service and that its staff of 55 is unlikely to grow much			0
' we want to operate as a startup , ' @entity4 said			0
though they 've known each other for years , @entity3 and @entity4 worked out the @entity9 - @entity5 deal in the 11 days before it was announced last wednesday			1
@entity3 said that it was n't until the pair got aligned on the vision for @entity60 and getting everyone in the world connected that they started talking about combining their companies			0
relatively unknown until now in the @entity114 , @entity5 is popular in other countries , both in @entity116 and in emerging economies			0
@entity4 and co-founder @entity118 , both former @entity120 engineers , started the company five years ago			0
also invited to the celebration , was @entity7 , @entity6 , @entity6 singer of hit song @entity23			0
@entity7 star @entity6 arrives at the party at @entity124 in @entity15 unlike @entity9 , @entity5 eschews advertising and instead charges people 99 cents a year after the first year to use the service			2
on the surface , @entity9 and @entity5 appear to hold divergent views on a number of matters , but @entity3 said the companies share a common vision in making the world more connected			2
some 70 percent of world 's population , or 5 billion people , are still without internet access			0
and access , @entity3 said , is growing slower than many people in the @entity142 - connected world believe			0
when he announced @entity60 last summer , @entity3 noted that since the wealthiest members of the world 's population are already connected to the @entity142 , getting the next billions online is unlikely to be profitable any time soon , if ever			0
@entity3 leaving @entity146 with wife @entity3 - who received a cake and roses for her 29th birthday on monday , @entity3 acknowledged that he ' ca n't construct a model ' in which @entity60 's efforts will be profitable for @entity9 in the near future			1
' i think we are probably going to lose money on this for quite a while , ' he said , though he added that over time there will likely be some benefit to @entity9			0
judging by @entity9 's stock price , investors seem confident in @entity3 's long - term view			1
on monday , @entity9 's shares hit in midday trading , $ 71.44 , their highest level ever .			2
