by @entity0 @entity1 is primed to give trainer @entity2 a @entity4 winner with his first ever runner when lining up in tuesday 's curtain - raising @entity6			1
it is a massive day for the man who took over running the family stable from five - time champion trainer father , @entity2 snr , at the start of the year			1
he also saddles his 2,000 @entity14 against @entity15 , the colt which chased him home at @entity18 , in the feature @entity20			1
primed : @entity1 has attracted the most confident update from @entity2 that promises to be a re-match to settle the arguments still hanging in the air			1
but it is @entity1 , the mount of @entity28 , who has attracted the most confident update from @entity2			1
the colt , owned by @entity32 , has not run since trailing in last of six in @entity34 's 10 - furlong @entity33 in august			1
the son of @entity36 had previously proved himself one of the best milers of his generation with victory in the @entity40 , a success which followed an agonising short - head defeat by @entity43 in last year 's @entity20			1
back at that trip , he is a hot favourite for the first of three group one races on the strongest day 's programme at this glittering five - day @entity50			2
@entity2 said : ' @entity1 is in great nick			1
he is the most awesome horse we have ever trained			2
yes , he will improve for the race but i would be disappointed if he did n't win			2
' he is awesome when he works and that has not changed from last year			2
' he had a break and was not right after the @entity33 but he is back right now			2
he is near unbeatable at a mile when he is right and the guys who ride him out each day tell me he is in fantastic form			2
' big day : @entity2 is looking for his first @entity4 winner after taking over the family stable eighty winner on board by @entity4 is a start @entity2 would have settled for			1
the big one was @entity68 's guineas win , a @entity70 victory which sent out a message that it was business as usual at the biggest stable in the land despite a change of chief executive			1
the @entity75 , which also featured @entity77 winner and runner - up , @entity79 and @entity80 , in third and eighth respectively , is looking a quality renewal but its tactical nature â € “ the field split into two separate groups â € “ left some feeling @entity15 was an unlucky loser			0
that view did not diminish when @entity15 dashed home five lengths clear in the @entity67 under jockey @entity89			0
added spice to the re-match is provided by the fact that @entity2 and @entity93 are battling it out for the trainer 's title race , with @entity2 only Â £ 70,000 ahead			1
but @entity2 , who also saddles @entity67 seventh @entity96 in the race , is unfazed by those who think @entity68 got lucky on the @entity18			1
he said : ' i see no reason for a reversal ( in the form )			0
we finished from behind @entity15 at @entity18 and our horse also swerved			0
they should be 6 - 4 joint favourites			0
' @entity15 was impressive in the @entity106 but we are very happy with our fella			0
' if the battles on the track promise to be as intense , there is a more than a fascinating sideshow off it concerning broadcaster @entity114 and its viewing figures			0
having taken a big plunge on derby day , there is nervousness around the industry that there will be a similar trend at the sport 's showcase flat meeting			0
@entity125 have called up the celebrity cavalry to add some pizzazz to their output in the form of fashion guru @entity130 and the weighing room 's best known face @entity133 , who will be a pundit between riding commitments , something his boss @entity137 surprisingly appears happy to happen			0
but halting the fall is a challenge you would not back @entity141 to pull off			0
moving away from the @entity142 to saddle up with a minority channel has inevitably meant a lower profile for the sport			0
it will probably need another win for the @entity148 in thursday 's @entity149 to place racing at the centre of the sporting agenda in such a packed wider schedule dominated by the @entity154			0
no one should be holding their breath waiting for a upturn in viewers although , sources insist , talk of imminent crisis talks with the broadcaster a year and a half into a four - year rights deal is premature .			0
