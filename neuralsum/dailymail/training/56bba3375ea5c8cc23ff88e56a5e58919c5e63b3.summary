@entity1 founder @entity0 walked into the @entity3 embassy to claim asylum @entity6 's president said today the @entity8 nation would have to consider ' whether @entity0 's life is at stake ' , with a decision on his asylum claim expected to be made later today			1
the @entity1 founder spent a second night at the @entity6 embassy last night , after making a last - ditch plea for political asylum			1
mr @entity0 , 40 , is attempting to evade extradition to @entity18 , where he faces sex attack allegations , and walked into the @entity14 two nights ago , claiming political asylum and citing his human rights			1
president @entity23 told @entity24 the country ' defends the right to live '			1
president @entity23 also said : ' we are analysing @entity0 's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way			1
we ca n't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete			0
' a police source today confirmed @entity0 will be arrested if he leaves the @entity6 embassy			1
there are currently no arrangements in place to provide him with safe passage out of the @entity40 should he be granted asylum by the @entity8 country			2
president @entity23 told @entity45 's @entity44 tv network in @entity46 : ' he wants to continue his mission in a country , and i cite it textually because the sentence impressed me a lot , that he wants to continue his mission of free expression without limits , to reveal the truth , in a place of peace dedicated to truth and justice			1
' meanwhile , @entity0 's celebrity backers faced an embarrassing £ 240,000 financial headache following his bid to avoid extradition to @entity18 over alleged sex attacks			1
the @entity1 founder walked into the @entity14 claiming political asylum and citing his human rights			1
but @entity68 said he faced arrest for breaching his bail conditions – while a list of high - profile supporters , led by socialite @entity73 , risk losing tens of thousands of pounds they put up to keep him out of jail			2
the desperate move by mr @entity0 , 40 , stunned miss @entity73 , who confirmed she was one of those who put up the cash for him			1
asked on @entity81 whether she was ' on the hook ' for his breach of bail , she replied : ' yes			2
i had expected him to face the allegations			0
i am as surprised as anyone by this			2
among those believed to have been accepted as guarantors are journalist @entity107 , magazine publisher @entity108 , @entity111 winner sir @entity110 and @entity113 peer lord @entity112			0
miss @entity93 said on @entity81 : ' i would like to set the record straight			0
i did n't post bail for @entity0			2
' film director @entity96 and socialite @entity73 are just two of the celebrity backers who are believed to have put up £ 20,000 each so that @entity0 could keep his freedom in december 2010 @entity1 founder @entity0 with his lawyer @entity120 @entity73 and @entity121 arrive to attend the extradition case of @entity0 at @entity123 in @entity124 , south - east @entity125 , in february 2011 those who did stand surety for mr @entity0 – freed on bail in december 2010 after spending nine days in @entity130 jail when held under a @entity132 arrest warrant issued by the @entity18 – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the @entity3 embassy , just yards from @entity135 , on thursday evening			1
embassies are regarded as ' safe havens ' which @entity40 police can not enter			0
while mr @entity0 remains inside the building he is safe from arrest – and extradition			1
he requested political asylum under the @entity143 , ironic given @entity6 's poor record on human rights and free speech			2
but mr @entity0 is friendly with the @entity8 country 's socialist leader @entity23			1
last month the @entity149 interviewed him for his new tv series @entity151 , broadcast on the @entity154 state - sponsored today tv channel , in which the president – who has clashed with @entity156 – praised @entity1 and the two men laughed and joked			2
the dramatic move to seek refuge inside the embassy came days after the @entity161 rejected mr @entity0 's appeal against extradition			1
he was expected to be sent to @entity18 within a fortnight			2
he denies the @entity18 allegations but fears it may lead to him being sent to the @entity167 to face charges over his whistle - blowing website , for which he could face the death penalty for espionage			1
the @entity172 said it had been told at 10.20pm on tuesday that mr @entity0 had breached a bail condition , that he stay at a specific address between 10pm and 8am			1
' he is now subject to arrest under the @entity177 for breach of these conditions , ' a spokesman said			0
' officers are aware of his location at the @entity182			0
' mr @entity0 's friend @entity183 , from the @entity184 at @entity185 , emerged from the embassy at lunchtime			1
he said : ' he is in very good humour and grateful for the hospitality of the embassy			2
he is meeting with the lawyers now to discuss all of it			0
' @entity6 has already said it is seeking the views of the @entity40 , @entity18 and @entity167 governments before deciding on the asylum application			1
if they decide not to hand mr @entity0 back there will be a messy diplomatic spat , with @entity40 and @entity156 putting pressure on the @entity6 government and stressing there is no humanitarian or legal reason for keeping him inside the embassy			1
@entity204 , inefficiency and political influence have plagued the @entity6 judiciary for many years			2
÷ in a referendum held in 2011 , president @entity23 obtained a mandate for constitutional reforms that would significantly increase government powers to constrain media and influence the appointment and dismissal of judges			1
÷ @entity6 's laws restrict freedom of expression , and government officials , including @entity23 , use these laws against critics			1

@entity274 justice remains a problem			0
such violence occurs particularly in indigenous communities and poor neighborhoods of major cities			0
÷ while the constitution and laws prohibit torture and similar forms of intimidation , some police officers have reportedly tortured and abused suspects and prisoners			0
÷ from 2007 through to august 2010 , the @entity288 held 503 disciplinary tribunals for abuses committed by police			0
