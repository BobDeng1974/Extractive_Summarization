by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 6 september 2013 a graduate from @entity2 has designed a simple yet revolutionary camera lens that can be fitted to a smartphone camera and used to zoom to microscopic levels			1
the six millimetre @entity6 has a magnifying range of between 15x and 60x - by comparison a high - end smartphone camera comes with around 10x zoom			1
it is made of silicone that is capable of sticking to a smartphone camera lens without any extra adhesive and costs just $ 15 ( £ 9 )			1
the @entity6 has a basic 15x zoom and will cost £ 9 plus shipping when it goes on sale in late september base magnification : 15x maximum magnification : 60x with phone zoom minimum recommended camera : 5 @entity28 product diameter : 1/4 ' " ( 6 mm ) material : @entity31 catalysed silicone optically identical to glass soft lens that ca n't be scratched self - adheres to almost any mobile phone or tablet camera @entity38 and can be washed with soap and water all photos taken can be edited and shared in the same way as normal photos using the phone 's built - in gallery and editor			1
the @entity47 was created by 22 - year - old @entity48 from @entity49 after he began working on the idea while studying @entity51 at the @entity2			2
@entity48 set up a @entity53 project to raise funding for the project in august and has already raised more than $ 68,000 ( £ 44,000 ) before the campaign ends on 10 september			0
the lenses are made of a patent pending technology called platinum catalysed silicone			0
it is a sticky material that can be washed using soap and water , without damaging its adhesive qualities			1
the left - hand image was taken of a coin using a traditional smartphone camera			1
the image on the right is the same coin taken by the same camera but with a @entity47 attached , zoomed in 60x a smartphone with the 6mm @entity47 attached			1
it is made of sticky platinum catalysed silicone that can does n't require extra glue , ca n't be scratched and can be washed using soap and water @entity48 claims that because the lens is classed as soft - meaning it is flexible - it ca n't be scratched like traditional glass lenses and is ' optically identical to glass '			1
this means it has the same transparency as glass and can also bend and view light in a similar way			0
future versions of the lens could reveal the intricate details of an insect wing ( insect not specified ) - a user can easily see the fragile structure and mottled texture of the body part @entity48 's @entity53 campaign is for funding of a 15x version of the lens but @entity48 is also working on a @entity103 version that would produce sharper images , such as these microscopic views of an onion , left , and pollen , right here a piece of fabric looks as if it is covered in thick multicoloured wires , but in fact the ' barbs ' are very soft fibres that have been magnified 150x by a future version of @entity48 's @entity116 he adds that , in theory , the lens should stay sticky ' forever '			2
on his @entity53 page , @entity48 said he : ' believes , a cheap and portable microscope of this kind could not only be used for entertaining purposes , but also provide possibilities for health and disease prevention in the developing world			0
' although @entity48 claims the @entity47 works with most major smartphones and camera , he recommends it is used with a camera that has @entity132 or higher for the best results			2
here a smiley face is displayed next to a coin to show its size before it is magnified with the detachable lens the smiley face suddenly becomes much bigger and every minute detail of the pen mark and the texture of the paper can be seen although @entity48 claims the @entity47 works with most major smartphones and camera , he recommends it is used with a camera that has @entity132 or higher for the best results			2
he also warns that the lens might not fit with phones that have ' funky geometry ' but does not list any examples			0
the @entity53 campaign is for funding of a 15x version but @entity48 is working on ways to mass produce a higher magnification models			0
' further down the road , i intend to make a @entity161 version of the lens available , ' said @entity48			0
' having a cheap and portable microscope would have huge implications for health and disease prevention in the developing world			0

@entity47 can be fitted on top of most smartphone camera lenses
it has a zoom between 15x and 60x - a high - end smartphone has 10x zoom
it does n't use any adhesive and is made of a *naturally* sticky material
the lens can be removed and washed with soap and water
