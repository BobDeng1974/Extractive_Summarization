the @entity0 who could follow @entity1 as the most powerful figure in world football has promised that he will consider stripping @entity4 of the @entity4 if elected as the next @entity6 president			1
@entity0 @entity7 , 55 , a former diplomat and a long - serving senior @entity6 insider until 2010 , is the only person yet to make a formal declaration of candidacy for the presidential race next may			1
@entity1 has suggested strongly he will stand , in which case @entity12 will have an uphill task			1
bid : @entity7 is the only person to make a formal declaration of candidacy for presidential race but if @entity1 's bid was stymied by health or other reasons then @entity12 , a former aide , will have @entity1 's influential backing , and a good chance of success			1
the significance of @entity12 speaking out on @entity4 should not be underestimated because he is free to speak - as a current @entity6 outsider - in a way in which @entity1 can not as current president			1
' if nothing irregular has happened then maybe the @entity4 does still go [ to @entity4 ] , ' says @entity7			1
' and if it has happened then all options , including moving the @entity4 , have to be on the table			2
' in an exclusive interview with the @entity35 , @entity7 says @entity4 's treatment of migrant workers is under scrutiny and could cost them			1
new figures show more than 430 @entity41 workers have died in @entity4 since january 2012 , and more than 567 @entity43 workers			2
they still die at a rate of more than one a day			2
the second threat to @entity4 is the logistical difficulty of moving the tournament to winter to avoid the unplayable heat of summer			2
surprise : @entity6 president @entity1 announces @entity4 as the host nation for the @entity51 2022 the third threat is an anti-corruption probe headed by @entity55 lawyer @entity54 , seeking wrongdoing in the bidding process			1
separate @entity6 evaluation processes are under way into all three areas and due to be concluded by early next year , though @entity7 admits key decisions could fall to the next president			1
it could land on my desk , ' he says			2
he insists he has no @entity68 agenda , having lived and worked in the @entity69 , somewhere he believes a future @entity4 should be staged			2
' i lived in this area , i learned @entity71 , ' he says			2
' i love the region and i think it 's a good thing to take the @entity4 to a cultural area where it has never been organised			0
but for me it 's clear [ that for @entity4 to keep 2022 ] we need to know the outcome of three processes			0
' first , we can not go to a @entity4 on the blood and death of workers			0
second , the disruption will be huge if the tournament is moved to winter			0
last , but not least , i do n't know what is in @entity54 's report , but we need to go with a clear mind to the @entity4 without any allegations in the back of the brain			0
' @entity7 knows @entity6 inside out and is campaigning on an agenda of radical reform , aimed at purging the governing body of corruption and sharing wealth more fairly			1
concern : @entity7 says @entity4 's treatment of workers is under scrutiny and could cost them he says he was ' flabbergasted ' in december 2010 when @entity6 's 22 - man executive committee voted for @entity4 to stage the 2022 event			1
' if i had been in the @entity102 i would have voted for @entity103 for 2018 and @entity104 for 2022			0
why ? because i felt we should continue the continental rotations and for 2022 it was time to go back to the @entity55 continent , in my view			0
' he says that holding a @entity4 in @entity55 in 2022 would have opened up the possibility of a @entity112 with bids from @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and perhaps @entity43 , @entity117 or a ' dream @entity119 candidacy ' of a coalition of @entity122			2
those options for 2026 may still come to pass in the extraordinary event that @entity4 lost 2022 and it was reassigned , perhaps to @entity104			0
@entity12 has first - hand knowledge of workers ' welfare issues in the @entity122 as his first diplomatic assignment was in @entity130			1
' we can not go and rejoice in stadiums , have a celebration of football , knowing it has been done on the blood , suffering and death of workers , ' he adds			0
' i welcome that ( @entity142 @entity141 member ) @entity140 said that in future , human rights has to be integrated in the criteria of the bidding			0
i 'm in favour of organising @entity148 in democracies			0
' @entity7 warns that changing the date of @entity4 from june - july 2022 to winter would have ' tremendous consequences on the organisation of football ' with the knock - on effect damaging seasons before and after			1
he adds : ' i was privileged to get hold of a very , very good document compiled by the @entity158 ( the organisation of @entity161 leagues ) , which shows how disruptive it would be , not only in @entity161 but @entity163			0
' as for @entity54 's anti-corruption report , @entity7 speaks of ' allegations of political influence in countries like @entity168 , @entity142 , @entity0			1
allegations of collusion between @entity4 and @entity171			0
allegations of , shall we say , commercial deals [ linked to bids ] to say the least			0
my position is clear : we need to know			0
