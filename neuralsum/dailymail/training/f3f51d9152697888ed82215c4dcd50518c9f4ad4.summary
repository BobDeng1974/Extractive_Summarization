by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 14:06 est , 22 january 2013 it was the £ 1.6million cocaine racket hatched by a ' gang of four ' britons that has left one of them facing death by firing squad in @entity7			0
but on may 17 last year , when @entity9 allegedly met two members of the syndicate at a hotel in @entity13 , she must have appeared an ordinary middle - aged woman living a relatively mundane life			1
her world was to be totally shattered by the events of the next 48 hours			0
at the hotel , prosecutors say she met @entity9 and @entity9 , both 39 , to arrange for her to courier the cocaine to @entity7 unmasked : briton @entity9 covers her face days after customs officials found her carrying 5kg or cocaine and then showed the haul to the press sentence : today the grandmother was put on death row and another member of the gang she helped police catch could receive the same tomorrow @entity9 , @entity9 claims , was the man who placed 5kg of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase			1
she was later to tell the police that the actual owner of the drugs was @entity9 though both were later to deny these accusations			1
whatever the truth , the @entity44 grandmother was to fly to @entity7 two days later carrying £ 1.6million of cocaine			0
she was intercepted at @entity47 , the main airport on the @entity49 island , where customs officials x-rayed the suitcase , found the drugs and arrested her			2
in custody , eating a £ 1 bowl of chilli fried rice , @entity9 cracked as soon as she was told she would be executed if convicted			1
she immediately confessed that she had been told to hand over the drugs to @entity9 and her partner , @entity58 antiques restorer @entity9 , 43			1
the couple were known as the ‘ @entity60 ’ of @entity7 as they managed to afford the £ 1,000 - a - week rent on their palatial villa without seemingly working			0
insisting that she was just a mule , @entity9 also claimed she was forced to be a courier because of threats against her children in @entity69			1
police then set up a sting operation , and followed the grandmother as she went about contacting @entity9 , @entity9 , and @entity9			1
king and queen : couple @entity9 , 39 , and @entity9 , 43 , became well known in @entity7 for their lavish lifestyle but they were eventually arrested and accused of forming a drugs syndicate fourth man : @entity9 , right , was also arrested on suspicion of being the ' muscle ' of the group and given four years in jail last month they sent @entity9 to a £ 25 - a - night hotel room , where she was accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate			1
police claim @entity9 turned up at the hotel while @entity9 , whom they believe was the gang 's ' muscle ' , waited nearby			1
both were arrested and @entity9 was also taken into custody			2
all three denied the charges and despite @entity9 's evidence , the case against @entity9 and @entity9 was soon to crumble when officers failed to find any concrete evidence connecting the suspects			0
police sources said that all conversations between @entity9 and @entity9 were carried out through mobile phones			1
but officers had failed to retrieve a sim card during a raid on @entity9 ’s @entity7 villa , meaning there was no physical evidence			0
@entity9 received a one - year jail sentence in the @entity112 last month for hiding the crime			1
she could be on her way back to the @entity69 by april , to be reunited with her daughter , because she had already been in jail for eight months awaiting trial			0
at the time of her arrest , @entity9 insisted she was the victim of a ' fit - up ' , @entity9 , a long - time @entity7 resident , was also spared a harsh sentence when judges gave him four years for possession of a small amount of hashish			2
case : this is the villa in @entity7 used as the home of @entity9 and @entity9 , @entity69 also arrested and accused of drug smuggling £ 1.6million of cocaine the fourth @entity131 , @entity9 , is accused of being one of the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island			2
@entity9 said he simply thought mrs @entity9 was bringing a present for his daughter ’s sixth birthday			0
‘ @entity9 believes 100 per cent that he was trapped by @entity9 , ’ his lawyer said at the time			0
@entity9 reportedly said he thought the gift - wrapped packages , bearing the words ' @entity144 ' were sweets for his little daughter			0
' i was the subject of entrapment by @entity9 , who knew my daughter was going to be six shortly after her arrival , ' he said			0
' having been caught she aided the police surveillance and brought the cocaine to me wrapped as if it was a present for my daughter			0
i never touched the drugs			0
' today @entity9 burst in to tears and cried ' no , no , no ' as she was sentenced to death in a @entity7 court			2
a verdict is expected in the trial of @entity9 as early as tomorrow , where he could be given the same sentence , which would make him the 13th @entity131 abroad facing the death penalty			1
shock : @entity69 citizen @entity9 listens to her interpreter as she is sentenced to death by @entity49 judges today			2

@entity9 , *56* , was caught flying into the *holiday* island from @entity13 with 5kg of drugs on may 17 last year
she told police @entity9 , 39 , @entity9 , 43 , and @entity9 , 39 were the *ringleaders* and she was the mule
