a young mother has told how she saw a mysterious silver object hovering in the sky above her house this morning			1
@entity4 , 26 , took these photographs on her smart phone after spotting what she described as a car - sized , silvery object above her back garden in @entity11 , @entity12 , early today			1
the mother - of - one said she watched as the @entity14 split into two , reconnected , and then flew off			1
' it was so bizarre , it took my breath away			0
' i ran inside to get my phone			0
there was n't enough battery left to film it , but there was enough to take pictures , so i started snapping away			2
' it was hovering , spinning like a top , and as i watched it , it split up vertically into two pieces			1
' she added : ' i 'm a country girl and i know what sheep sound like , but the sheep in the field beyond were making a horrible , high pitched sound all the time it was there			0
' slowly , the two pieces joined back together and then about 15 seconds later it just shot off straight up into the sky - in the blink of an eye			1
' i 've never seen anything move so fast			0
i 've seen a shooting star before and it was faster than that - there 's no way it could be man - made , it moved too fast			0
miss @entity4 , pictured with daughter @entity57 , says she does n't believe in aliens but ca n't explain what she saw ' as soon as it went , the sheep fell silent			1
' miss @entity4 , who works as a horse - trainer , showed her photographs to relatives , who told her that her own aunt and grandmother had experienced unexplainable sightings over the same moor , thought only at night			1
but she remains skeptical about what she saw			0
' i ca n't explain it , ' she said			1
' it moved too fast to be of this earth , but i do n't believe in aliens			2
' @entity14 sighting : miss @entity4 saw the mysterious object hovering above her home in @entity11 , @entity12 @entity78 , an expert on ufos and a former government adviser on unexplained phenomena , said : ' this is truly bizarre and what makes it particularly mysterious is the description of the way the object moved from a hover to a high speed in an instant			1
' this rules out most of the conventional explanations such as aircraft lights , a meteor / fireball , or a @entity96 lantern			0
' perhaps it was some new secret , prototype spy plane or drone , but if not , it 's a genuine mystery			0
it would be fascinating to find out if anything unusual was tracked on radar			0
