@entity0 has been endorsed as the man to captain @entity2 at the @entity4 , days after leading a tunnel stand - off in @entity6 which set the defiant tone for his side 's heroic victory			1
the @entity12 flanker has been the established skipper throughout @entity14 's three - year tenure , but he has always had to earn the right to retain the job on a tournament - by - tournament basis			1
now , however , the national coach has made an unprecedented declaration of long - term faith in @entity0 's capacity to fulfil the role			1
@entity24 's instinct is to avoid nailing his colours to the mast but he said : ' players get injured and things happen that are out of your control			2
but it would take a big change of heart now to move from the direction we 're going with @entity0			2
@entity0 ( centre ) passes to tighthead @entity37 during @entity2 training at @entity40 @entity0 fires out a pass during his side 's first training session following his side 's 21 - 16 win against @entity46 @entity14 's squad warm - up at @entity40 following their bruising encounter in @entity6 @entity51 lock @entity50 is back in training having recovered from a knee injury @entity14 ( right ) issues instructions to his players as they prepare for saturday 's game against @entity57 @entity59 lock @entity58 ( centre ) put in an impressive shift against the @entity63 pack on friday night ' i 've got other good players in the back row who are all desperate for an opportunity , but @entity0 has been excellent and we need to make sure we continue to back him			1
we certainly will in this @entity70 and , fingers crossed , he 'll be fit and available for june			2
' that suggests only injury can deny @entity0 the honour of leading the host nation into the @entity4 , which represents emphatic progress for the 28 - year - old			1
he has been captain in 32 of the 33 tests he has played for his country but even as recently as last june , at the end of @entity2 's trip to @entity82 , the coaches were voicing grave misgivings about the openside 's breakdown credentials and inviting a challenge from other specialist @entity88 no 7s			1
during the autumn , @entity0 was caught up in the criticism which came @entity2 's way after defeats against the @entity82 and @entity94			1
but he finished the november series with a towering performance in the victory over @entity98 and then led by example at the @entity100			2
@entity2 captain @entity0 ( left ) set the tone for the match with his pre-match stand - off in the tunnel @entity14 said : ' he 's been excellent			1
confidence in his ability as a player is the fundamental thing behind leadership			0
you 've got to be secure of your place in the team			0
he 's earned that and he earns it on a weekly basis			2
' he did it again against @entity46 with the number of tackles he made , the turnovers he made and his contribution to the game			2
we look at people 's involvement , not just in the rucks but in their work - rate off the ball			2
he 's continually at the top of that as well			0
' he 's earned the respect of all the players and as a consequence he 's leading them effectively			0
but he 's also got the strength of solidarity from the leaders around him as well			0
they back him up to the hilt			0
' in the moments before kick - off last friday , @entity0 illustrated his increasing authority by resolutely refusing to lead his team down the tunnel until receiving assurances that @entity46 would not keep them waiting in the cold for long			1
it was a stance which infuriated the hosts and set a bloody - minded tone for what was to follow			1
@entity151 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity150 worked brilliantly as a backrow triumvirate in the moments before kick - off last friday , @entity0 illustrated his increasing authority by resolutely refusing to lead his team down the tunnel until receiving assurances that @entity46 would not keep them waiting in the cold for long			1
it was a stance which infuriated the hosts and set a bloody - minded tone for what was to follow			2
@entity14 attempted to down - play the significance of that stand - off but asked if his skipper would have done the same thing before the @entity70 opener at @entity165 in 2012 , he said : ' it would n't have been a decision i 'd have encouraged him to make in what was my first game in charge			1
' you take your time to find your feet			0
we have that confidence and belief now			0
there are a lot of players in the changing room who have played in big games , not only for their clubs , but also internationally			0
that investment in the last two to three years is beginning to tell			0

@entity195 centre @entity193 ( centre ) is also back in contention for selection for the @entity57 clash @entity200 ( left ) and @entity201 should be fit for the clash with @entity203 at the @entity204 on march 1 ' you take your time to find your feet			1
we have that confidence and belief now			0
there are a lot of players in the changing room who have played in big games , not only for their clubs , but also internationally			0
that investment in the last two to three years is beginning to tell			0
' there is a fine line but i 'd hate to think we come across as an arrogant team because i do n't think we are			0
but you want to show what you are about as a group and that possibly showed in that moment			0
i 'd like to think there is no arrogance in the team but growing confidence			0
' @entity2 are likely to field an unchanged starting xv against @entity57 at @entity230 on saturday , despite having @entity231 , @entity193 and @entity50 back in training after injuries			1
among the other casualties , @entity234 and @entity235 are expected to play for @entity237 on friday , while fellow @entity238 @entity200 and @entity201 should be fit for the clash with @entity203 in @entity240 on march 1			1
but @entity241 is unlikely to feature in the championship and it is not certain when @entity195 prop @entity244 will recover from a neck problem .			0
