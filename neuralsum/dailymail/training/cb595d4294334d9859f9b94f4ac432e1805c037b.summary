a flood of @entity2 proportions just like in the story of @entity4 may have actually happened , according to the oceanographer who found the @entity6			1
acclaimed underwater archaeologist @entity7 claims his team of researchers have uncovered evidence that suggests the @entity11 described in the @entity2 was actually based on real events			1
mr @entity7 told how he investigated a controversial theory proposed by two scientists from @entity15 that there was a massive flood in the @entity18			1
but when the glaciers began to melt during a warming period in the cycle of the @entity43 's temperature around @entity45 water rushed toward the world 's oceans , mr @entity7 said			1
this , he claimed , caused floods all around the world and water cascaded through @entity51 â€™s @entity50 towards the @entity18			1
' where i live in @entity53 was ice a mile above my house , all the way back to the @entity57 , about 15 million kilometers , that 's a big ice cube , ' he said			1
' but then it started to melt			1
we 're talking about the floods of our living history			1
the questions is , was there a mother of all floods ? ' his research follows a 1997 study by @entity70 and @entity71 who , drawing on archaeological and anthropological evidence , claimed that ' ten cubic miles of water poured through each day ' , and that the deluge continued for at least 300 days			1
a working replica of @entity78 built six years ago by @entity79 as a testament to his faith in the @entity2 in @entity82 , the @entity83 the animals coming were two by two : the story of @entity4 is described in the book of @entity26 legendary : a manuscript of @entity4 from the @entity89 1493 more than 60,000 square miles of land were flooded , they said , and the lake 's level rose by hundreds of feet after merging with the @entity94 , triggering mass animal migrations across @entity96			1
according to their study , the force of the water was two hundred times that of @entity101 , sweeping away everything in its path			1
it also transformed the @entity18 from an isolated freshwater lake surrounded by farmland into a saltwater inlet			2
the researchers , whose findings have been backed up by carbon dating and sonar imaging , claimed that the story of @entity4 's flood had its origin in this cataclysmic event			2
passed down : a 14th century @entity117 manuscript showing @entity4 at the end of flood ' we went in there to look for the flood , ' mr @entity7 told @entity34			1
' not just a slow moving , advancing rise of sea level , but a really big flood that then stayed ... the land that went under stayed under			2
' the team found an ancient shoreline which mr @entity7 believes is proof such an event did take place			1
he believes that , by using carbon dating shells found along the shoreline four hundred feet below the surface , it took place around 5,000 bc. ' it probably was a bad day , ' he said			1
' at some magic moment , it broke through and flooded this place violently , and a lot of real estate , 150,000 square kilometers of land , went under			2
' as the theory goes , the story of the disaster was passed down from generation to generation and eventually inspired the biblical account of @entity4			2
@entity4 is described in the @entity2 as a family man , a father of three , who is about to celebrate his 600th birthday			2
' in the early chapters of @entity26 , people live 800 years , 700 years , 900 years , ' said rabbi @entity154 , a professor of @entity155 and @entity156 at the @entity157 in @entity158			2
' those are mythic numbers , those are way too big			2
we do n't quite know what to do with that			2
so sometimes those large numbers , i think , also serve to reinforce the mystery of the text			2
' ' it probably was a bad day , ' he said			0
' at some magic moment , it broke through and flooded this place violently , and a lot of real estate , 150,000 square kilometers of land , went under			0
' @entity7 mr @entity7 's team has also found an ancient shipwreck , as well as ancient pottery			1
although he does not think he will ever find @entity4 , he believes he may find evidence of an ancient community washed away			1
in the book of @entity26 , @entity29 despairs of human corruption and decides to flood the @entity43 , instructing @entity4 to build an ark to save himself , his family and a pair of each animal species			0
the @entity78 is described in the @entity26 as 300 cubits long , or approximately 450ft ( 137m ) , but despite many rumours and claims of sightings , no scientific evidence of its existence has ever been found			1
' the oldest shipwreck that we have discovered so far of that area is around 500 @entity45 , classical period , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' but the question is you just keep searching			0
it 's a matter of statistics			0
' mr @entity7 , who led the international team that located the wreckage of the @entity6 in 1985 , does not think he will ever find @entity4 's @entity78 however , mr @entity7 does think he may find evidence of a people whose entire world was washed away about 7,000 years ago			1
he and his team said they plan to return to @entity51 next summer			0
' it 's foolish to think you will ever find a ship , ' mr @entity7 said , referring to the @entity78 ' but can you find people who were living ? can you find their villages that are underwater now ? and the answer is yes			1
' according to @entity215 , it came to rest ' in the mountains of @entity217 '			0
experts have agreed that these mountains are to be located in present - day @entity220 and eastern @entity51			0
many biblical scholars believe the story of @entity4 was inspired by the legendary flood stories of nearby @entity224 , in particular ' the @entity225			0
' these ancient narratives were already being passed down from one generation to the next , centuries before @entity4 appeared in the @entity2			0
' the earlier @entity224 stories are very similar where the gods are sending a flood to wipe out humans , ' said biblical archaeologist @entity233			0
' there 's one man they choose to survive			0
he builds a boat and brings on animals and lands on a mountain and lives happily ever after ? i would argue that it 's the same story			0
' catastrophic events of this kind are not unique to the @entity2			0
some contemporary examples include the 2004 tsunami that wiped out villages on the coasts of 11 countries surrounding the @entity250			0
there was also @entity252 , described as the worst hurricane in @entity255 history			0
scholars are n't sure if the biblical flood was larger or smaller than these modern day disasters , but they do think the experiences of people in ancient times were similar to our own			0
' if you witness a terrible natural disaster , yes , you want a scientific explanation why this has happened , ' said @entity266 , author of a history of @entity29			0
' but you also need to something that will help you to assuage your grief and anguish and rage			0
and it is here that myth helps us through that			0
' regardless of whether the details of the @entity4 story are historically accurate , the author believes this story and all the @entity2 stories are telling us ' about our predicament in the world now			0
