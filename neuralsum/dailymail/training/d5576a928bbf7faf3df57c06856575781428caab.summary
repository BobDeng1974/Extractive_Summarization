by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 12 september 2013 studies of the skeleton have shown that @entity3 suffered from a fractured left hand , a severely sprained ankle and lower back pain the bones of a slave known as mr @entity10 will be laid to rest today 215 years after his death			1
@entity3 's skeleton will lie in state in the @entity14 in @entity15 before it is taken to the church in @entity18 where he was baptised for a service			1
he will be buried in a nearby cemetery with other prominent figures to the sound of bagpipes and ' @entity26 '			0
@entity27 , one of the organizers , said : ' it 's a long overdue honor			2
we 're not just remembering one man			0
his body is representing all of the slaves that came over here and worked in this country			0
' @entity3 was owned by dr @entity37 on a farm in @entity18 , @entity39 , and died of a suspected broken neck in 1798			1
after his death dr @entity37 , a bone specialist , had his skeleton boiled in order to preserve and study it			1
the remains were donated to a @entity18 museum in 1933 by a descendent of dr @entity37 who referred to the skeleton as ' @entity50 '			0
since then the bones have been studied by scientists keen to learn more about @entity3 and his life			2
so far scientists have established that @entity3 was 5ft 5in tall and died aged roughly 55			1
though the results have ruled out hanging as a cause of death , nobody knows exactly how @entity3 broke his neck			1
we do know that in life he suffered with a fractured left hand , a severe ankle sprain and lower back pain			1
@entity66 , an assistant professor at @entity68 's school of medicine , said that at the time of @entity10 's death he was ' an individual who was in considerable distress			2
' he was never buried in case technology allowed more information to be extracted from his remians in the future , but now a ct scan of the bones has been taken meaning they can be studied without the need to keep them			0
when @entity10 died in 1798 slavery was still common throughout the @entity82 , especially in the @entity83 , and was n't abolished for another 66 years @entity84 , past president of the @entity85 , agreed that it was time for the bones to be buried			1
she said : ' now we feel even though he was used that way he did prove underneath the skin we 're all the same			0
' the rev. @entity91 of @entity92 in @entity18 , who will preside at the funeral , said she considers @entity3 a parishioner , though one who died long ago			2
she said : ' i think it 's been a very convoluted path to justice			0
i 'm hoping we can use this as a learning experience and a time of reflection on how do we as human beings treat one another and how do we deal with issues of diversity now			0
