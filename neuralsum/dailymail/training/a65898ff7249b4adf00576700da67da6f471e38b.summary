it has become common practice for manufacturers around the world to sell phones and tablets with less storage space than is advertised on the box			2
and while many users are happy to put up with this discrepancy , two @entity9 owners have decided to take @entity12 to task about it			2
in a suit filed in @entity17 , the pair accuses the tech giant of ' concealing , omitting and failing to disclose ' that on @entity21 versions of @entity22 , more than 20 per cent of the advertised space is n't available			1
they accuse the tech giant of ' concealing , omitting and failing to disclose ' that , on @entity21 versions of @entity31 models that have @entity32 8 pre-installed , in excess 20 per cent of the advertised storage space is not available ( illustrated in this graph ) the lawsuit has been filed by @entity25 and @entity26 from @entity17			1
they are suing @entity12 both individually , ' and on behalf of all others similarly situated			2
' ' @entity12 ’s misrepresentations and omissions are deceptive and misleading because they omit material facts that an average consumer would consider in deciding whether to purchase its products , ' explained the suit , first spotted by @entity45			2
' namely , that when using @entity32 8 , as much as @entity46 of the represented storage capacity on a device represented to have @entity21 of storage capacity is , in fact , not available to the purchaser for storage			2
' and a chart contained within the files shows that this discrepancy does n't just apply to the latest models of the device			0
older models that update to @entity32 similarly suffer			0
for example , storage space on the @entity61 drops by 18.8 per cent , the @entity59 drops by 21.3 per cent , and the @entity63 by as much as 23.1 per cent , in comparison to advertised space			2
the files continued : ' @entity12 fails to disclose that upgrading from @entity68 to @entity32 will cost a device user between 600 mb and 1.3 gb of storage space - a result that no consumer could reasonably anticipate			1
in january , which ? tested eight 16gb handsets from @entity76 , @entity12 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 ( pictured )			0
@entity76 's @entity81 was worst performing handset , with only 54 per cent ( @entity84 ) of available storage , while @entity12 's @entity86 was best , with 79 per cent ( @entity82 ) @entity88 - based analyst @entity87 recently studied @entity12 ’s @entity9 storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry - level phones , customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger , more expensive , device the following year			1
this ultimately makes the firm an extra $ 3billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) each year ' to put this in context , each gigabyte of storage @entity12 shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400 - 500 high resolution photographs			1
' ' the matter in controversy exceeds $ 5,000,000 exclusive of interests and costs , ' added the files , and the pair is demanding a jury trial			0
@entity12 does n't comment on ongoing court cases			0
in january , which ? tested eight 16gb handsets from @entity76 , @entity12 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
it found that @entity76 's @entity81 was worst performing handset , with only 54 per cent ( @entity115 ) of available storage , while @entity12 's @entity86 was best , with 79 per cent ( @entity117 )			0
the @entity118 has a similar amount of storage as the @entity61 , at @entity121 , which has been dubbed ' inadequate ' by users			0
@entity12 offers the @entity31 ( left ) and @entity9 6 ( right ) in @entity21 , @entity123 and @entity125 models by limiting the amount of storage on entry - level phones , in the ‘ lower tier ’ , customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device , in the middle tier , the following year			1
these customers are more likely to then stay in the middle tier , or in some cases move to the upper tier , but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage			0
this trend is even more common if @entity12 keeps the entry - level the same , but boosts the storage by three times or more in the following year			1
however , if @entity12 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but stay in the lower tier			1
all of these figures are taken from @entity87 's @entity147 site			0
in year one , @entity12 offers a @entity21 , @entity149 and @entity123 model and the customer buys the @entity21 version			0
the following year , @entity12 offers @entity21 , @entity123 and @entity125 models			0
the current @entity9 6 and 6 @entity153 are available in these sizes , for example			0
this prompts the user to either stay the same , or upgrade to @entity123 in year two			0
this @entity123 costs more than the @entity159 version did the previous year			0
by the third year , @entity12 can offer @entity149 as an entry - level model , but the customer wo n’t downgrade storage and stays with the @entity123 as a minimum			1
in year one , @entity12 offers a @entity21 , @entity149 and @entity123 model and the customer buys the @entity167 following year , @entity12 offers @entity21 , @entity123 and @entity125 models			0
this prompts the user to either stay the same , or upgrade to @entity123 in year two			0
this @entity123 costs more than the @entity159 version did the previous year example 2 alternatively , if @entity12 offers an entry - level @entity118 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity149 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model			1
and so on into year three , if @entity12 offers @entity123 as a minimum			0
this means they spend less money each year , and @entity12 ca n't move customers from the lower to the middle or higher tiers			0
alternatively , if @entity12 offers an entry - level @entity118 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity149 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model @entity88 - based analyst @entity87 recently studied @entity12 ’s @entity9 storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry - level phones , customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger , more expensive , device the following year			1
he claims @entity12 makes an extra $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) each year by not doubling the amount of minimum storage every time a new model is released			1
‘ @entity12 's decision to keep the entry - level storage tier at @entity21 for the @entity9 , despite doubling the other capacities to @entity123 and @entity125 , continues to raise eyebrows , ’ explained analyst @entity87 on his @entity147 site			1
‘ @entity12 's near - term motive behind keeping the @entity21 capacity option is pretty clear : get people to buy the @entity123 option			0
’ but , as mr @entity87 explained , @entity12 ’s strategy is more complex , and forward - thinking than that			1
he believes that by limiting the amount of storage on entry - level phones , in what he calls the ‘ lower tier ’ , customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device , in the middle tier , the following year			1
however , if @entity12 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but stay in the lower tier			1
according to mr @entity87 's calculations , @entity12 's middle tier strategy makes @entity12 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion ) these customers are then more likely to then stay in the middle tier , or in some cases move to the upper tier , but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage			2
this trend is even more common if @entity12 keeps the entry - level the same , but boosts the storage by three times or more in the middle tier , the following year			1
however , if @entity12 doubles the amount of storage on the entry - level model each year , people upgrade but will always stay in the lower tier			1
according to mr @entity87 's calculations , the middle tier strategy makes @entity12 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion )			2
this is a difference of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion )			1
mr @entity87 claims that this difference is based on @entity12 charging an average $ 20 ( £ 13 ) more for the handsets year - on - year			1
if @entity12 charged more , the difference would be greater			0
for example , in year one , @entity12 offers a @entity21 , @entity149 and @entity123 model and the customer buys the @entity21 version			0
the following year , @entity12 offers @entity21 , @entity123 and @entity125 models			0
this prompts the user to either stay the same , or upgrade to @entity123 in year two at a higher premium than the @entity149 cost the previous year			0
by the third year , @entity12 can offer @entity149 as an entry - level model , but the customer wo n’t downgrade storage and stays with the @entity123 as a minimum			2
alternatively , if @entity12 offers an entry - level @entity118 one year , but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to @entity149 , the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage , but they ’re still technically buying the entry - level model			1
and so on into year three , if @entity12 offers @entity123 as a minimum			0
mr @entity87 also worked out how much revenue @entity12 makes by keeping the @entity21 model as a minimum , and using the middle tier strategy			2
according to his calculations , the middle tier strategy makes @entity12 $ 47 billion ( £ 30 billion ) a year			1
but the lower tier strategy makes $ 44 billion ( £ 28 billion ) - a difference of $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) , simply by charging an average $ 20 ( £ 13 ) for the handsets			1
‘ by doubling the middle tier storage capacity to @entity123 , while maintaining the price , and keeping the @entity21 storage capacity at the bottom tier , i estimate that approximately 30 per cent of previous @entity270 owners will upgrade to @entity123 to take advantage of the better deal , ’ continued mr @entity87			2
‘ while some may say this discussion profitability is anti-consumer , observers need to look at this process as a bit more than just greed			0
‘ a case can be made that @entity12 is looking to get users dependent on higher storage , by carefully guiding customers into a particular @entity9 model each year			2

the lawsuit was filed by @entity25 and @entity26 from @entity17
they are suing @entity12 both individually , ' and on behalf of all others '
pair accuses firm of ' concealing and failing to disclose ' true storage space
on @entity296 models , running @entity32 8 , ' 20 *%* of the advertised storage space is not available '
earlier this month , an analyst studied @entity12 ’s @entity9 storage strategy
he believes that by limiting storage on entry - level phones , customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger device the following year
mr @entity87 claims this strategy makes @entity12 $ 3 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) a year
