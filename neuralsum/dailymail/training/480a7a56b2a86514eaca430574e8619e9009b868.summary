by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 15 april 2013 with the imminent release of @entity3 on consoles and the exciting @entity5 announced , @entity1 talked to @entity6 from @entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 to find out what we can expect			1
how does this version of @entity13 differ from the pc ? @entity15 : i think additional months of expanding and polishing are noticeable			1
there 's more content , including exclusive console maps			2
plenty of bugs have been removed and adjustments made for @entity14 after the game ’s initial release , these changes are already implemented in the console version			2
we put in additional effort toward code optimization and balancing gameplay and controls for using a pad			2
basically it 's still good old demon - slaying mayhem			2
hellishly good : @entity3 and @entity37 features some of the largest bosses in games of the same genre 2			1
what about the graphics ? what can console owners expect ? @entity15 : besides the optimization required by the console engine itself and the screen resolution adjusted for @entity50 , there 's not a real reduction in visual quality			2
some of the textures had to be more limited with density ; however during work on the console builds we 've also improved the look of certain special effects			2
therefore sitting in front of the tv with a console pad , i 'm actually enjoying the game more than on a pc ( but my hard work at the office on this game for the last year also has something to do with that , i must admit ) .3			2
why did you decide to make the game on current gen with next gen around the corner ? @entity15 : without being ready to use the game engines and not having a really clear vision of player ’s expectations , the next gen consoles were n’t the best target for us			1
we may aim towards next gen with some of our next projects , but @entity83 & @entity37 was planned long ago and we were already in the advanced stages more than a year ago so we did n't want to wait			1
@entity85 : the next gen release is probably not too far away but this does n’t mean that the mass market will adapt to that with the same pace			2
with the current generation we can basically make all we want			0
of course there are limitations here and there but with the great technology and optimizations that we have , we can make fantastic looking games			1
from a business perspective it ’s just very attractive to publish games for devices that have an install base of 70 million or even more.4			1
to those who are new to @entity13 , what is the story ? @entity15 : @entity107 , the main hero , is dead			1
he is trapped between @entity108 and @entity109 because his sins are hard to be forgiven even by @entity112 's rulers			0
also with @entity107 being an ultimate bada * * , he 's pushed to fight against demons and collect their souls for the @entity116 to set his own soul free and join his wife in @entity119			0
sounds fanciful ? great , that 's only the beginning – the story is both a continuation and re-imagination of the events from the original painkiller game released in 2004 and you can expect a lot of dark themes there			0
all killer : painkiller is one of the fastest fps games around which , until now , may have best suited @entity14 gamers 5			1
you have @entity5 on the horizon			0
how has working on @entity13 influenced this game ? @entity15 : besides technology , not too much			1
there is a different design and art team , different gameplay rules and controls , completely new ways of building the player 's immersion			0
@entity5 is like a classic summer adventure movie , not dark and gothic fantasy horror that we can compare @entity13 with			1
of course , because of the 10 years spent on painkiller - like titles , some of the design decisions have come surprisingly easy ( like why not to add some demonic mummies )			0
the key fun factor of @entity5 is related to exploration combined with combat , treasure hunting and puzzle solving , not to look for the fastest way to dismember as many undeads as you @entity162 : @entity5 has very different demands			0
while @entity13 is mainly a shooting experience , for @entity5 it is necessary to make the bridge between a shooter and an adventure game where it ’s all about exploration and telling an interesting story			1
a lot of work goes into making that right and telling a great story			0
what can we expect in @entity177 ? what graphics engine does it use ? @entity15 : we ’ve used @entity180 , so you may expect all the bells and whistles provided by one of the best rendering engines in the world			1
the game has very specific player mechanics – you 'll use not only weapons , but also adventurer 's equipment like a compass , flashlight , notebook and maps			0
on top of that you need to prepare for an extensive use of the most important item : your brain			0
@entity177 balances between action and adventure gameplay and there are separate difficulty modes for puzzles and for combat , so depending on your preferences you may customize the experience more towards your style of play.7			1
what can we expect plot wise ? @entity15 : it 's hard to describe it without giving away the game ’s secrets			0
however the plot starts in the late 1930s , when the main hero named @entity217 joins an international chase for a mysterious artifact that can give people immortality			0
fighting against nazis , thugs , @entity225 spies and travelling across several continents , he avoids deadly traps and solves countless riddles leading to the greatest treasure of all time			0
new adventure : @entity5 is nothing like @entity13 - focusing on exploration and combat rather than trying to dismember as many of the undead as possible 8			1
will there be multiplayer and are there any unique modes given the subject matter ? @entity15 : we have multiplayer modes and also unique modes			0
i do n’t want to reveal any more at this time.9			0
what will the difference be between the pc and console versions of @entity177 ? @entity15 : we 're making both versions consistent at all levels , but we plan to make some exclusive content for each platform , for now let ’s just keep it as a hidden treasure to be discovered … @entity85 : yes and of course we do platform specific optimization and polishing to bring a great game to fans of both console and pc gaming			1
@entity3 & @entity37 is out on may 31 for @entity259			1
while @entity5 is released on july 30 on @entity260 and @entity14			0
follow us on @entity261 : @ @entity262 and on @entity263 : @entity264 .			0

@entity3 & @entity37 coming to consoles before @entity177
@entity9 : @entity177 is trying to bridge the gap between shooter and adventure title
both games built on the @entity180 and @entity13 ' optimised ' for consoles
