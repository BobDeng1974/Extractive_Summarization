by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 08:49 est , 7 august 2012 @entity3 's ' obsession ' with wind farms will push up family electricity bills by more than £ 300 a year , a report claimed today			1
the government 's green energy plans for the next eight years are a £ 124billion ' blunder ' that will hit every @entity3 household , a senior @entity3 economist has also said			1
in a stark warning professor @entity11 , who has produced a study on how wind energy will hit energy costs , said that @entity3 consumers simply can not afford to subsidise wind power			2
false economy ? wind power will add £ 300 to the average annual electricityl bill , a report claimed today prof @entity11 is one of the @entity3 's leading energy economists and works at the prestigious @entity22			1
he was also a senior adviser on energy and environmental policy at the @entity25			0
by 2020 average electricity bills will be around 58 per cent higher - a £ 320 increase - just because of the flood of wind turbines planned for @entity30 's coastlines , fields and seas , he said			1
completing the gloomy picture , professor @entity11 believes for all the huge investment in wind farms @entity3 's greenhouse gas emissions may not even fall			2
wind energy provides almost 2 per cent of global electricity worldwide , a figure expected to approach 10 per cent by 2020 , costing @entity3 an estimated £ 124 billion			1
' the key problems with current policies for wind power are simple , ' he said			0
supply : the government wants to move away from traditional ways of generating energy to reduce greenhouse emissions ' they require a huge commitment of investment to a technology that is not very green , in the sense of saving a lot of @entity54 , but which is certainly very expensive and inflexible			2
critic : energy expert professor @entity56 says that wind power will be the next big ' political problem ' as it is just too expensive ' unless the current @entity44 scales back its commitment to wind power very substantially , its policy will be worse than a mistake , it will be a blunder			1
' the average household electricity bill would increase from £ 528 per year at 2010 prices to a range from £ 730 to £ 840 in 2020			1
' the report has been published by former chancellor @entity69 's @entity68			2
their study has been handed to the @entity72 and @entity74 study for the @entity75			0
meanwhile , professor @entity56 , who is professor of energy conversion at @entity78 and an advisor the @entity80 , also said that windfarms are too costly			0
instead he claims that combined gas cycle plants could produce the same amount of green energy for £ 13billion – nearly 10 times cheaper than wind power			1
' wind energy is the most expensive way of generating renewable electricity , ' he said			2
' it will also cost jobs			0
we are already seeing some industrial firms packing up and moving abroad			0
the increasing price of energy is going to be the next big political problem			0
' chart : wholesale electric gas prices from 2007 until july 2012 show the huge difference in price the big six firms buy and sell to consumers at increase : many more farms like these ones off @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity105 will be created and the government insists this is the right way to go however , the government was keen today to defend its green energy policies			1
' wind power is a homegrown , secure and sustainable source of energy with an important role as part of a balanced energy mix , ' a spokesman said			0
' over-reliance on any one technology could have serious consequences for consumer bills			0
that ’s why we want to see a diverse energy mix with renewables , nuclear , clean coal and gas all playing a part			0

report to be handed to @entity44 says that electricity prices for average home will go up 58 *%* by 2020 because of turbines
