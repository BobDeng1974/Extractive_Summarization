@entity1 's bid to host the 2022 @entity2 is on the rocks over concerns about the environment			1
@entity1 are competing against @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 to host the biennial match between @entity13 and the @entity14			0
but the developments needed to the @entity16 , which was nominated as the @entity2 course and is this week hosting the @entity18 – have been deemed too significant , with the removal of between 6,000 and 15,000 trees necessary to modify the infrastructure			1
the country is also considering a bid for the staging of the 2026 @entity2			2
‘ unfortunately the problem of hosting the @entity2 in 2022 is that the @entity43 course is a resort course and not designed for a big scale golf tournament like a @entity2 or even a @entity18 , ’ said @entity39 , president of the @entity40			1
‘ if you notice there is not one grandstand on the golf course this week and there is just no place for them due to the enormous amount of trees			0
‘ we have calculated we would have to cut down 6,000 to 7,000 trees and something like 15,000 trees on the @entity59 ( at the nearby @entity60 ) just to make way for everything that goes with hosting a @entity2			2
@entity63 ( centre right ) led @entity13 to victory against the @entity14 in the @entity2 in september the event was held on the @entity67 , which was modified for the biennial showpiece ‘ all the trees are numbered and licensed and environmentally it would be impossible to get permission to cut them down			0
’ he added : ‘ we estimate the @entity2 will cost @entity1 between 100 - 200 million euros to host and we have shown our commitment to big tournament golf with the hosting again this week of the @entity18			1
‘ one way or another we will be hosting the @entity31 's @entity77 until 2023 - that will be the 100th anniversary of the @entity1			2
‘ that gives us another nine years and along with the @entity82 event , we are already going to spend something like 70 - 85 million euros on these tournaments			0
‘ so together with this continued investment and the new @entity2 course we will build , that will cost an extra 30 - 40 million euros , it will show our commitment to @entity13 golf			0

@entity1 is bidding to host the @entity2 for the first time in 2022
but bid is in trouble due to modifications required for existing courses
@entity16 is hosting @entity18 this week
but course would require huge numbers of *protected* trees removed to host @entity2
@entity1 is considering bid in 2026 on a purpose - built course
